<text>Omar Efraín Torrijos Herrera (February 13, 1929 – July 31, 1981) was a Panamanian dictator and military leader of Panama, as well as the Commander of the Panamanian National Guard from 1968 to his death in 1981. Torrijos was never officially the president of Panama, but instead held self-imposed and all-encompassing titles including &quot;Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution&quot;. Torrijos took power in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and instituted a number of social reforms.

Torrijos is best known for negotiating the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties that eventually gave Panama full sovereignty over the Panama Canal. The two treaties guaranteed that Panama would gain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, ending the control of the canal that the U.S. had exercised since 1903. On December 31, 1999, the final phase of the treaty, the US relinquished control of the Panama Canal and all areas in what had been the Panama Canal Zone. 

His son Martín Torrijos was president from 2004 to 2009.

== Background ==
Omar Efraín Torrijos Herrera was born on February 13, 1929, in Santiago in the province of Veraguas, the sixth of twelve children. His parents were both employed as teachers. His Panamanian mother was Joaquina Herrera Gordillo, and his father, José Maria Torrijos Rada, was originally from Colombia. He was educated at the local Juan Demóstenes Arosemena School and, at eighteen, won a scholarship to the military academy in San Salvador. He graduated with a commission as a second lieutenant. He joined the Panamanian army, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional), in 1952. He was promoted to captain in 1956 then to major in 1960. He took a cadet course at the School of the Americas in 1965. He became the Executive Secretary of the National Guard in 1966.

== Career ==


He had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel by 1966. Due to accusations of his involvement in election frauds, Torrijos was ordered to El Salvador in 1968 as a military attaché. It was during this year that his close friend in the Guardia, Major Boris Martínez and Colonel Jose Humberto Ramos (godfather of his son Omar) initiated a meditated and successful coup d&#x27;état against the recently elected president of Panama, Arnulfo Arias, after almost eleven days in office.

Having received news of the coup while in the Canal Zone, Torrijos and a few officers including Demetrio Lakas sought to re-establish some form of civilian rule, including an attempt to install Arnulfo&#x27;s vice-president, Raúl Arango, as the new president, much to Martínez&#x27;s dismay. Although a two-man junta was appointed, Martinez and Torrijos were the true leaders from the beginning. Torrijos was promoted to full colonel and named commandant of the National Guard. They barred all political activity and shut down the legislature. They also seized control of three newspapers owned by Arias&#x27; brother, Harmodio and blackmailed the owners of the country&#x27;s oldest newspaper, &quot;La Estrella de Panamá&quot;, into becoming a government mouthpiece. With enough opposition against Martinez including from the United States, Torrijos ousted and exiled Martinez and Ramos to Miami on February 23, 1969, nearly four months after the initial coup. He then promoted himself to brigadier general.

For him, the overthrown government &quot;was a marriage between the armed forces, the oligarchy and the bad priests; the soldier carried his rifle to silence the people and forbid &quot;the scoundrel&quot; to disrespect the ruling class. &quot;Explaining that his revolution acts &quot;for the poor, not for the owners&quot;, he had a new Constitution, an agrarian reform, and a Labour Code adopted and recognized the workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; unions.

Torrijos promoted land reform, education, and social welfare programs in an effort to reduce inequality and strengthen Panama’s sovereignty. His government&#x27;s most popular measure was the redistribution of agricultural land. The reforms were accompanied by a major public works programme. He also opposed North American multinationals, redistributing 180,000 hectares of uncultivated land. In February 1974, following OPEC&#x27;s model for oil, he attempted to form the Union of Banana Exporting Countries with other Central American States to respond to the influence of these multinationals, but did not obtain their support. Its policy promoted the emergence of a middle class and the representation of indigenous communities. 

In 1972, his government held an election of an Assembly of Community Representatives. The new assembly approved a new Constitution and elected Demetrio Lakas as president. Torrijos was the actual head of government, with near-absolute powers for six years.

Torrijos was regarded by his supporters as the first Panamanian leader to represent the majority population of Panama, which is poor, Spanish-speaking, and of mixed heritage – as opposed to the stereotypically white-skinned social elite, often referred to as (&quot;white-tails&quot;, or more recently, ), who had long (and still do, to a lesser extent) dominated the commerce and political life of Panama. He opened many schools and created new job opportunities for those less fortunate. Some say he even spent his weekends giving a thousand dollars to random people and charities. Torrijos instituted a range of social and economic reforms to improve the land lots of the poor, and redistributed agricultural land. He prosecuted the richest and most powerful families in the country, and in turn favored his political allies, which enabled them to amass their own fortunes at the expense of the Panamanian treasury. His reforms were accompanied by an ambitious public works program, financed by foreign banks.

In international politics, Torrijos supported Chilean President Salvador Allende and welcomed refugees after the 1973 coup d&#x27;état. He helped the Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua and other rebel forces in El Salvador, Guatemala, and renewed diplomatic relations with Cuba.

In 1978, he stepped down as head of the government but remained &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country while another one of his followers, Aristides Royo, was a figurehead president. He also restored some civil liberties; U.S. President Jimmy Carter had told him that the Senate would never approve the Canal treaties unless Torrijos made some effort to liberalize his rule.

=== Panama Canal ===
An admirer of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s nationalization of the Suez Canal, he embarked on a fight against the United States to gain Panama&#x27;s sovereignty. In 1973, in the absence of progress in negotiations with the United States, he tried to involve the UN: &quot;We have never been, are not and will never be an associated state, colony or protectorate, and we do not intend to add a star to the United States flag&quot;. The US vetoed the adopted resolution.

Torrijos negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties over the Panama Canal, signed on September 7, 1977. These treaties passed United States sovereignty over the canal zone to Panama, with a gradual increase in Panamanian control over it, leading to complete control on December 31, 1999. The United States, however, retained the permanent right to protect what it called the &#x27;neutrality&#x27; of the canal, allowing U.S. administration of the canal as well as military intervention through the now-legalized U.S. bases in Panama. These aspects of the treaty fell short of nationalistic goals and the ratification ceremony at Fort Clayton was somewhat of an embarrassment for Torrijos. He was noticeably drunk during the ceremony; his speech was badly slurred and he had to brace himself against the podium to keep from falling.

=== Political transition ===
With pressure from the Carter administration as well as from economic depression, Torrijos sought to appease public distress and defuse opposition from labor unions as well as influential oligarchs. He reintroduced the traditional parties by modifying the 1972 constitution and set elections for 1984. During this time, in 1979, Torrijos organized the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) which loosely linked to Socialist International ideals and represented a melange of social classes, namely the internationally affiliated bourgeoisie. Due to the incoherent nature of this organization, Torrijos was the pivotal figure in maintaining a stable vision between the left and right tendencies within it. His death in 1981, before the transition could be completed, caused a political crisis in the country which led to Manuel Noriega coming to power as military ruler.

== Personal life ==
Omar Torrijos has been generally regarded as a personable man though varying accounts appear contradictory. He married Raquel Pauzner in 1954 and had three children. Having spent most of his time with campesinos during the weekends, he had little time to spare for his children. He had three primary residences: a beach house at Farallón, a house at Coclesito, and a house on Fiftieth Street in Panama City, the last of which his family lived a few blocks from. According to first-hand accounts by Torrijos&#x27;s friend and guest, Graham Greene, Torrijos had a mistress who was studying sociology in the U.S.

Torrijos has been described as a heavy drinker who enjoyed Havana cigars and beautiful women. During a meeting with American Ambassador Brandon Grove in December 1969, Torrijos challenged him to a game of pinball and later said, “I’m not an intellectual but a man of horse sense, like a farmer”. Torrijos relished in the opinions others had of his colleagues and acquaintances especially if they coincided with his own. He has been described as humble and respectful as he listened to the plights of middle and lower-class people.

== Death ==
Torrijos died at the age of 52 when his aircraft, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter of the Panamanian Air Force, crashed at Cerro Marta, in Coclesito, near Penonomé, Panama on July 31, 1981. The aircraft disappeared from radar during light weather, but due to the limited nature of Panama&#x27;s radar coverage at the time, the plane was not reported missing for nearly a day. The crash site was located several days later, and the body of Torrijos was recovered by a Special Forces team in the first few days of August. Four aides and two pilots also died in the crash. His death caused national mourning around the country, especially in poor areas. Following a large state funeral, Torrijos&#x27;s body was briefly buried in a cemetery in Casco Viejo (the Old City of Panama), before being moved to a mausoleum in the former Canal Zone on Fort Amador near Panama City. He was succeeded as commander of the National Guard and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Panama by Florencio Flores (&quot;de jure&quot; was a military leader; however, &quot;de facto&quot; never exercised power as one,) who later gave way to Rubén Darío Paredes. The crash site is now a national park and his house in Coclesito is now a museum.

Torrijos&#x27; death generated charges and speculation that he was the victim of an assassination plot. For instance, in pre-trial hearings in Miami in May 1991, Manuel Noriega&#x27;s attorney, Frank Rubino, was quoted as saying &quot;General Noriega has in his possession documents showing attempts to assassinate General Noriega and Mr. Torrijos by agencies of the United States.&quot; No such documents have as yet been produced. In 1981, Soviet news agency TASS also claimed that the U.S. had caused Torrijos&#x27;s death.

Former Noriega chief of staff Colonel Roberto Diaz, a cousin of Torrijos, as recently as 2013 has several times accused the United States and Noriega of involvement in Torrijos&#x27;s death and called for investigations.

<text>Cigfa ferch Gwyn Glohoyw (Middle Welsh: &quot;Kigua&quot;) is a minor character in Welsh mythology, the wife of King Pryderi of Dyfed. She is mentioned briefly in the First Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, and appears more prominently in the third. Describing the character, Proinsias Mac Cana writes: &quot;Cigfa strikes one as a slight though effective vignette of a contemporary bourgeois snob while William John Gruffydd hypothesises that the character was a later addition to the tale. John Rhys suggested a connection between Cigfa and the Irish character &quot;Ciochba&quot;.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
After ascending to the throne of Dyfed, Pryderi searches for a wife and marries Cigfa, whose ancestry is recorded as &quot;Cigfa, daughter of Gwyn Glohoyw, son of Gloyw Walltlydan, son of Casnar Wledig&quot;. A similar lineage can be found in &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;, in which a saint named Mechyll fab Echwys is the grandson of Gwyn Glohoyw and great-grandson of Gloyw Walltlydan. Cigfa herself is not mentioned in the genealogy. 

Some time after their marriage, Pryderi leaves Dyfed to fight under Bendigeidfran in Ireland. He is one of only seven warriors to survive the battle, and returns home with Manawydan, rightful king of Britain, whom he married to his mother Rhiannon. The four friends live happily until they ascend the mound at Gorsedd Arberth and the kingdom turns into a barren wasteland, and all of its inhabitants disappear except for the four members of Pryderi&#x27;s family.

While out hunting one day, Pryderi follows a white boar and does not return, so his mother Rhiannon goes looking for him. She finds him motionless inside a mysterious building, touching a golden bowl. She tries to free him, but becomes enchanted herself when she puts her hand on the object. Manawydan and Cigfa stay together, the former promising to protect the latter, and finally free their spouses when they capture a mouse that is actually the wife of Llwyd ap Cil Coed, Rhiannon&#x27;s enemy, and force the magician to lift the curses plaguing their land.

<text>Khālid ibn ʿAbd al‐Malik al‐Marwarrūdhī () was a 9th-century Baghdadi astronomer.

In 827, Marwarrūdhī, together with the astronomer ʿAlī ibn ʿĪsā al-Asṭurlābī and a party of surveyors, measured the length of a meridian arc of one degree of latitude. The party travelled to the Nineveh Plains in the valley of the Tigris, at 35 degrees north latitude. The measurement they obtained enabled the astronomers to obtain a value of for the circumference of the Earth, (or, according to other sources, ). The two researchers measured in Arabian , and determined the geographical latitudes of the end points they used from the star altitudes in a celestial horizontal coordinate system. As it is thought that one Arabian represented , they found the length of 1° of meridian to be , which differs from the true value by .

Marwarrūdhī was chosen by the geometer Al-Abbās ibn Said al-Jawharī to organize a new observatory on Mount Qasioun. Despite encountering technical difficulties caused by the distortion of the astronomical instruments, in he spent a year obtaining of solar and lunar observations of the Sun and the Moon. He played a role in the project determine the length of the spring season by means of astronomical observations.

Marwarrūdhī was the first of three generations of astronomers.

<text>Interstate 16 (I-16), also known as Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway, is an east–west Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Georgia. It carries the hidden designation of State Route 404 (SR 404) for its entire length. I-16 travels from downtown Macon, at an interchange with I-75 and SR 540 to downtown Savannah at Montgomery Street (exit 167B). It also passes through or near the communities of Dublin, Metter, and Pooler. I-16&#x27;s unsigned designation of SR 404 has a spur that is signed in Savannah.

The westernmost segment in Macon is part of the Fall Line Freeway, a highway that connects Columbus and Augusta. This segment may also be incorporated into the proposed eastern extension of I-14, which is currently entirely within Central Texas and may be extended to Augusta.

All of I-16 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.

==Route description==
===Macon-Bibb County===

I-16 begins at an interchange with I-75/SR 540, just northwest of downtown Macon, in Bibb County. Here, it begins a concurrency with SR 540. The Interstate and SR 540 proceed southeast, traveling just east of the downtown area. They cross over the Ocmulgee River and then have an interchange with US 23/US 129/SR 49 (Spring Street/North Avenue). Then, they have a partial interchange with SR 22 (2nd Street) that is only accessible from the westbound lanes. Almost immediately is an interchange with US 80/SR 87 (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard/Coliseum Drive). At this intersection, SR 540 departs the concurrency to the north-northeast. Within the eastern part of this interchange, the highway travels under a railroad bridge that carries railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway. In the east-central part of Macon, I-16 travels through Ocmulgee Mounds National Historical Park but without direct access. Visitors need to first exit at the US 80/SR 87 exit. On the southern edge of the national monument, it crosses over Walnut Creek. It then travels on a bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX and Boggy Branch. After leaving Macon, I-16 curves to the south-southeast and has an interchange with US 23/U.S. Route 129 Alternate (US 129 Alt.)/SR 87 (Ocmulgee East Boulevard). In the interchange, the highway crosses over Swift Creek. It crosses over Stone Creek before entering Twiggs County.

===Twiggs, Bleckley, and Laurens counties===
I-16 curves back to the southeast and has an interchange with Sgoda Road. It crosses over Flat Creek and then has an interchange with Jeffersonville and Bullard roads. It curves to the east-southeast and crosses over Savage and Turvin creeks. It then curves back to the southeast. The highway has an interchange with SR 96. Almost immediately, it crosses over Richland Creek. It then has an interchange with SR 358. I-16 curves to the east-southeast and enters Bleckley County just before it has an interchange with SR 112 just south of Allentown. It then crosses over Rocky Creek just before entering Laurens County. The Interstate curves back to the southeast and crosses under SR 278 before it travels south of Montrose. It crosses over Bay Branch just before an interchange with SR 26. It then enters the southwestern part of Dudley. There, it has an interchange with SR 338. I-16 curves back to the east-southeast and crosses over Little Rocky Creek just before a rest area. Just to the west-northwest of a crossing of Turkey Creek, the westbound lanes have a rest area. These two rest areas are the only ones along the entire length of I-16. On the southwestern edge of Dublin, the highway has an interchange with SR 257. On the southern edge of the city are interchanges with US 319/US 441/SR 31 and SR 19 (Martin Luther King Jr. Drive). It then crosses over the Oconee River. It has an interchange with SR 199 (Old River Road) just before a crossing of Pughes Creek. Southeast of that is a crossing of Red Hill Creek. Just south of Rockledge, the highway crosses over Mercer Creek. On the eastern edge of the creek, it enters Treutlen County.

===Treutlen County===
I-16 curves to the east-northeast and crosses over some railroad tracks of CSX before an interchange with SR 29. It immediately curves back to the east-southeast. It crosses over Red Bluff Creek. Then is an interchange with SR 15/SR 78. The highway travels south of Sand Hill Lake before curving to the east-northeast. It crosses over Pendleton Creek and travels under a bridge that carries SR 86. Then, it begins to curve to the southeast. It has an interchange with US 221/SR 56. It crosses over Reedy Creek and curves to the east-southeast. It has an interchange with SR 297. At the overpass for SR 297, the highway enters Emanuel County.

===Emanuel County===
After the SR 297 interchange, I-16 heads more to the southeast. It curves to a nearly due east direction and crosses over the Ohoopee River. Just after crossing over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway, it enters the city limits of Oak Park. It curves to the southeast and has an interchange with US 1/SR 4/SR 46. After this interchange, the highway begins to parallel SR 46. It curves to the east-southeast and crosses over Jacks Creek. Then, it enters Candler County.

===Candler County===
I-16 has an interchange with SR 57 (Aline Road). It crosses over Wolfe Creek and then heads to the east-northeast. It crosses over the Canoochee River and curves to a nearly due east direction. It crosses over Sams Creek before entering Metter. As soon as it enters Metter, it passes the Metter Municipal Airport. Right after the airport is an interchange with SR 23/SR 121. On the southeastern edge of Metter, I-16 travels under a bridge that carries SR 129. It crosses over 15 Mile Creek and then curves to the southeast. It crosses over Tenmile Creek and has an interchange with Pulaski–Excelsior Road just before entering Bulloch County.

===Bulloch County===
The Interstate curves to the east-southeast and has an interchange with US 25/US 301/SR 73 and SR 555 (Savannah River Parkway). Then, it crosses over Lotts and Little Lotts creeks. It then travels northeast of Nevils. It briefly curves to the east-southeast, where it has an interchange with SR 67, and then curves back to the southeast. It crosses over DeLoach Branch and then curves to the east-southeast. It crosses over Luke Branch and then Boggy Branch before curving to a nearly due east direction. It has an interchange with Ash Branch Church Road. After a crossing of Ash Branch, the highway curves to the east-southeast. It has an interchange with SR 119 just before entering Bryan County.

===Bryan, Effingham, and Chatham counties===
Almost immediately, the highway crosses over Black Creek. It then curves to the southeast and has an interchange with US 280/SR 30 southwest of Blitchton. It crosses over some railroad tracks of Georgia Central Railway and then crosses over the Ogeechee River, which marks the Effingham County line. It has an interchange with Old River Road south of Meldrim and then enters Chatham County. The first city in the county that I-16 enters is Bloomingdale. There, it has an interchange with the southern terminus of SR 17 Conn. (Jimmy DeLoach Parkway). It crosses over the Little Ogeechee River. It very briefly travels along the Bloomingdale–Pooler city line before entering Pooler proper. It has an interchange with Pooler Parkway. It crosses over the Savannah–Ogeechee Canal just before an interchange with I-95. Here, I-16 begins traveling along the southern edge of the city limits of Pooler. Right after the I-95 interchange, the highway crosses over the Hardin Canal. At an interchange with SR 307 (Dean Forest Road), I-16 begins traveling along the Savannah–Garden City line. It briefly enters the city limits of Savannah before traveling along the Savannah–Garden City line again. It has an interchange with the Chatham Parkway. It then reenters Savannah and curves to the east-southeast. It crosses over some railroad tracks of CSX just before an interchange with I-516/US 17/US 80/SR 21/SR 25/SR 26 (W.F. Lynes Parkway). Here, US 17 begins a concurrency with I-16. It crosses over the Springfield Canal just before a partial interchange with the former eastern terminus of SR 204 (West 37th Street). This interchange is only accessible from the eastbound lanes. I-16/US 17 curves to the northeast. At the next interchange, US 17 splits off, where State Route 404 Spur (SR 404 Spur) begins. This interchange also provides access to Gwinnett Street. The highway has an interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The westbound access for this highway is at the eastern terminus. I-16 curves to the north-northeast and reaches its eastern terminus, an interchange with Montgomery Street in downtown Savannah. The construction of this interrupted sections of Berrien Street, West Jones Street, and West Charlton Street.

===Miscellaneous notes===
I-16 serves as a hurricane evacuation route for Savannah and other coastal areas. The road is designed for contraflow travel with railroad-type gates to block most entrance and exit ramps for the normally eastbound lanes. During hurricane evacuation, I-16 is converted into westbound traffic from Savannah to west of US 441 in Dublin (exit 51), a total of .

==History==

The first part of I-16 opened October 11, 1966, to traffic between US 319 (exit 51) in Dublin to SR 29 (exit 67) near Rockledge. In 1968, the segment between US 280 to downtown Savannah was completed and opened. By the early 1970s, I-16 was completed from downtown Macon at I-75 to Jeffersonville Road near Danville. It was also extended from Dublin to Allentown. In 1973, the connection between Macon to Dublin was completed. The last part of the I-16 opened on September 22, 1978, placing it in Emanuel, Candler, and Bulloch counties and completing the connection between downtown Macon and Savannah.

===1990s===
In 1999, Hurricane Floyd hit Georgia&#x27;s coast. As a result, the eastbound I-16 lanes from Savannah to US 1 (exit 90) were opened to westbound traffic. This marked the first time I-16 was turned into a one-way Interstate. This contraflow traffic method has been used since, including in 2016 in evacuation efforts from Hurricane Matthew and 2017 for Hurricane Irma.

===2000s===
Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway would begin with the number &quot;1&quot; and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, the Georgia Department of Transportation switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.

In 2001, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution to designate the Earl T. Shinhoster Interchange at the interchange with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Savannah in honor of Earl Shinhoster, who was a black civil rights activist. This interchange is located in the economic and cultural center for Black Savannah.

In 2003, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution to designate I-16 in honor of James L. Gillis Sr., a Democrat who served as a state representative, state senator, and director of the Georgia Department of Transportation, as the Jim Gillis Historic Savannah Parkway. Gillis&#x27;s sons, Hugh and James Jr., also served as Democratic state legislators. Hugh was a state representative from 1941 to 1953 and a state senator from 1953 to 1955 and from 1963 to 2005. James Jr. was a state senator from 1945 to 1946.

===2020s===
On July 15, 2021, a truck, with its dump trailer raised, struck the overpass bridge of SR 86 near exit 78, causing the bridge deck to shift . While no injuries were reported, the resulting damage prompted GDOT to close both directions of I-16 from exit 71 to exit 78 while the damaged bridge was being demolished. Both directions of I-16 were reopened within 48 hours of the incident. The reconstructed overpass was opened to traffic in late July 2022. Due to this, people had to take detours up to 10 minutes longer than the normal route through the towns of Adrian and Soperton.

==Future==
=== I-95 interchange ===
Due to high congestion during rush hour in Savannah and many deadly car accidents, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) has undertaken a new construction project at the interchange of I-95 and I-16 (exit 157 on I-16), along with other I-16 improvements. The project, dubbed as the 16@95 Improvement Projects, includes:

* The widening of I-16 from two lanes in each direction to three lanes between the junctions with I-95 and I-516 (exit 164).
* The construction of a partial turbine interchange (whirlpool interchange) at the junction of I-16 and I-95, in which two existing loop ramps, from I-16 westbound to I-95 southbound, and from I-95 southbound to I-16 eastbound, will be replaced with turbine configuration ramps.
* The creation of a collector–distributor road on I-95 northbound to separate through traffic from cars exiting onto and entering from I-16.
* The construction of a two-lane emergency median cross-over for westbound I-16 traffic between Dean Forest Road/SR 307 (exit 160) and I-95, to assist in hurricane evacuations from Savannah. 
* Ramp meters will be installed at exit 160 as well as exit 162 (Chatham Parkway)
* The reconstruction of six bridges, replacement of four bridges, and the construction of three new bridges near the area.
* The addition of new interchange lighting at the I-95 interchange and Intelligent Transportation System technology to provide real-time driving conditions to travelers.

The project, upon completion, is expected to result in a 32% decrease in I-16 congestion by 2030. Despite concerns from residents, no new noise barriers will be built along I-16 during the construction. A noise study concluded that barriers would not be necessary since traffic noise were not predicted to be over 66 dB(A).

The project is expected to cost around $295 million. Construction, which will be completed by Savannah Mobility Contractors JV, was set to begin in the second half of 2019 and be completed by the end of 2022. However, construction did not start until 2020, has been delayed multiple times, and is now expected to cost $317.4 million. The ramp from I-16 west to I-95 south was opened on March 23, 2023, with the ramp from I-95 south to I-16 east opened on June 2, 2023. Construction is ongoing as of January 29, 2024, with long-term detour routes in place.

=== I-75 interchange ===
The interchange of I-75 and I-16 is also undergoing construction as part of $500 million project, split into six phases, with the first three phases being worked on simultaneously. These phases were set to be completed by the end of 2021, but as of February 2023, only Phase 1 has been completed:

* Phase 1: A collector–distributor road was built on I-16 eastbound between the I-75 junction and Spring Street (exit 1A), including new bridges over the Ocmulgee River and Spring Street. The Spring Street loop ramp was temporarily closed and replaced with a temporary left turn onto I-16 westbound. Also, the bridge over the Ocmulgee River on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was reconstructed and widened in this phase. This phase was completed in the summer of 2022.
* Phase 2: Construction includes improvements on I-75 between Hardeman Avenue (exit 164) and I-16 (exit 165) and the shifting of exit ramps from I-75 in each direction to I-16. Later in this phase, access to Spring Street for traffic coming from southbound I-75 via I-16 will be temporarily closed to allow for completion of the collector–distributor system.
* Phase 3: A new collector–distributor road is being built along I-75 north through the I-16 interchange, along with a new westbound collector–distributor road from Spring Street along I-16 over the Ocmulgee River and portions of other ramps.
Construction on Phase 1 was completed by C.W. Matthews at a cost of $63 million, while construction on Phase 2 and Phase 3 is being completed by E.R. Snell Company for $156 million.

Three additional phases are included in the project, which ultimately are intended to help improve access to and from downtown Macon and Gray Highway via the currently-underutilized Second Street bridge, reducing congestion on Spring Street and North Avenue:

* Phase 4: Bids for a construction contract are scheduled to occur in 2021. Second Street will be widened and ramps from and to eastbound I-16 will be constructed. Construction from Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be completed, along with the collector–distributor road through the I-75 interchange along eastbound I-16 to the Coliseum Drive/Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard exit. Access from I-75 southbound via I-16 to Spring Street will be reopened at the conclusion of this phase.
* Phase 5: Bids for a construction contract are scheduled to occur in 2021. During this phase, the Spring Street loop ramp will be reopened and the temporary left turn lane on northbound Spring Street to I-16 westbound will be closed permanently. Also, Phase 3 construction will be completed, and a connection to the north-to-east ramp from Phase 2 will be built. This phase also includes the completion of the westbound collector–distributor road from Phase 3, along with a new ramp from Second Street to westbound I-16.
* Phase 6: Bids for a construction contract are scheduled to occur in 2023. A tunnel will be built for the Norfolk Southern Railroad under I-75. All remaining construction will be completed in this phase.

Also as a part of this project, GDOT spent $12 million in the Pleasant Hill neighborhood to help mitigate the effect of the construction and new highway ramps. The construction, which was completed in the summer of 2018, included the creation of two new parks and the transformation of Penniman House, the childhood home of the late musician Little Richard, into a community resource center. This project was labeled as Phase 1B.

==== Effect of construction on Port of Savannah traffic ====
According to GDOT, with the expansion of I-16 at its interchanges with I-75, I-95, and I-516, the estimated increase in gross state product (GSP) would be $9.1 million at a cost of $1.95 million. In addition, employment would increase annually by 2,426, and the return on investment (ROI) would be 4.7.

===Possible removal of the Earl T. Shinhoster Bridge===
In Savannah, city and state officials are currently considering removing the Earl T. Shinhoster Bridge, which carries eastbound traffic over Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and onto Montgomery Street at the eastern terminus of I-16. The construction of the I-16 flyover ramps into Savannah in the 1960s led to the removal of Union Station, as well as two full city blocks, which had severe negative impacts on the African American community. A study about possibly removing the ramps was approved and funded by the Savannah City Council in December 2023. The study, which is listed as the I-16 Ramp Removal Study, will be managed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), and the Federal Highway Administration. In March 2024, Georgia U.S. Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock announced that $1.8 million in federal funding had been allocated toward the planning of the project.

==Exit list==
















==Auxiliary routes==
===Spur route===
State Route 404 Spur (SR 404 Spur) is a spur route that travels from I-16 exit 166 northward along US 17 to the South Carolina state line. As its number suggests, it is a spur from SR 404, the unsigned route that is designated along the full length of I-16. However, SR 404 Spur is actually a signed highway. Near the northern end is the Talmadge Memorial Bridge.




===Interstate 516===

Interstate 516 (I-516) is a auxiliary route from SR 21 (Augusta Road) in Garden City to DeRenne Avenue in Savannah. It is also known as W.F. Lynes Parkway and has an unsigned designation of State Route 421 (SR 421).

<text>In ancient Celtic religion, Rudianos was a war god worshiped in Gaul. In Roman times he was connected with Mars.

== Name ==
He was invoked at Saint-Andéol-en-Quint and Rochefort-Samson (Drôme), and at Saint-Michel-de-Valbonne. The name &quot;Rudianos&quot; means &#x27;red&#x27;, reflecting the warlike nature of the god. At Saint-Michel-de-Valbonne there was also found a prehistoric image of a mounted war-god, dating to the 6th Century BC, who could perhaps be Rudianos himself. The menhir-shaped stone depicts a roughly incised figure of a horseman, with an enormous head, riding down five severed heads. The iconography is evocative of the head-hunting exploits of the Celts, who hung the heads of their battle victims from their saddles, according to classical writers.

<text>The Saône ( , ; ; ) is a river in eastern France. It is a right tributary of the Rhône, rising at Vioménil in the Vosges department and joining the Rhône in Lyon, at the southern end of the Presqu&#x27;île.

The name derives from that of the Gallic river goddess Souconna, which has also been connected with a local Celtic tribe, the Sequanes. Monastic copyists progressively transformed &quot;Souconna&quot; to &quot;Saoconna&quot;, which ultimately gave rise to . The other recorded ancient names for the river were and .

==Geography==
The Saône rises at Vioménil at the foot of the cliff of the in the Vosges at an elevation of ; it flows into the Rhône at Lyon at an elevation of .
Its length is . Its largest tributary is the Doubs; upstream of receiving the Doubs at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs in Saône-et-Loire, the Saône is called the &quot;Petite Saône&quot; (lesser Saône), which reflects the large contribution of the Doubs to the Saône. In fact the Doubs&#x27;s mean annual flow rate is slightly stronger than that of the Petite Saône, compared to ; some thus assert that it is in fact the Saône that flows into the Doubs. Nonetheless, the Saône has a substantially larger watershed than the Doubs, at &quot;vs.&quot; .

At the Saône has the largest watershed of any French river that does not flow directly into the sea, covering approximately 1/18 of metropolitan France.

In pre-Roman times the river&#x27;s name was &quot;Arar&quot;, a doubling of the Indo-European root &quot;ar&quot; (water). According to Julius Caesar&#x27;s Commentaries on the Gallic War this doubling reflected the idea that it was difficult to identify the direction of the river due to its slow rate of flow. The Battle of the Arar was the first major battle of the Gallic Wars. Its current name came from a sacred spring, &quot;Sauc-Onna&quot;, located at Chalon, which was used by Roman legionaries to refer to the entire river.

===Main tributaries of the Saône===
R indicates a right tributary, L indicates a left tributary.
== Navigation ==

The Saône is navigable from its confluence with the Coney at Corre in the north of the &quot;département&quot; Haute-Saône all the way to its confluence with the Rhône (itself a navigable river) at La Mulatière, in Lyon. The navigable stretch is long, of which has been redeveloped to European high-capacity dimensions from Saint-Symphorien-sur-Saône to Lyon. It has 5 locks. The 161 km long part upstream from Saint-Symphorien-sur-Saône to Corre, also named &quot;Petite Saône&quot;, is navigable for Freycinet gauge ships and has 19 locks.

The Saône is linked with the Loire by the Canal du Centre, with the Yonne by the Canal de Bourgogne, with the Marne by the Canal entre Champagne et Bourgogne (previously the Canal de la Marne à la Saône), with the Meuse by the Canal de l&#x27;Est, whose southern branch has been renamed the Canal des Vosges, and with the Rhine by the Canal du Rhône au Rhin. All the canals are Freycinet gauge.

Also navigable are the small Canal de Pont-de-Vaux (3 km), the Seille, navigable in a stretch up to Louhans, as well as the lower part of the Doubs. None of these three connect the Saône to any other waterway.

== Hydrology ==
=== The lesser Saône (Petite Saône) ===

The lesser Saône has a tendency to flood (sometimes influenced by snow), with a very strong oceanic effect. The soils are not susceptible to much infiltration, so that they saturate quickly which contributes to surface runoff. The flow rate grows very quickly, and after receiving the waters of the Lanterne, the Saône already becomes a powerful river.

The mean annual flow rate, or discharge, of the Saône has been measured over 50 years (as of 2013) at the Ray-sur-Saône hydrological station, situated about after the Lanterne confluence between Port-sur-Saône and Gray. The figure is for a watershed area of (the upper basin of the lesser Saône), and has an annual maximum of and a minimum of .

The river exhibits seasonal variations in flow rate, with winter floods from from December to March inclusive, and summer reductions in July/August/September falling to a monthly average of in August.

The runoff curve number in the upper basin of the lesser Saône is annually, &quot;cf.&quot; for the Lanterne, an elevated figure resulting from the very high rainfall in the Vosgian part of its watershed. The specific flow rate rises to 16.0 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed.

The maximum instantaneous recorded flow rate was on December 19, 1982.

=== The greater Saône (Grande Saône) ===

The greater Saône is formed by the confluence of the Doubs and the lesser Saône at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs. The Doubs brings a mean annual flow rate of , and the lesser Saône, .

The greater Saône has only modest tributaries which have little effect on floods or other hydrological properties. It flows in a vast plain approximately wide as far as Lyon in the basin of the former Bressan lake. The slope is very gradual, and without hydraulic projects up to the north of Chalon aimed at guaranteeing a deep navigation channel, overflows would be more frequent.

At the Couzon-au-Mont-d&#x27;Or hydrological station, where the river enters the Lyon area, measurements taken between 1969 and 1986 revealed a mean annual flow rate of , with a 100-year flood flow rate of The runoff curve number from the river&#x27;s entire watershed is , and the specific flow rate rises to 15.8 litres per second per square km of watershed.

==== Average flow rate ====
Overall, the average flow rate in Lyon is , with a minimum of , in August, and a maximum of , in February.

=== Historic floods ===
When the Saône floods, the impact varies considerably over the course of the river. A large flood with a strong flow rate upstream can be largely attenuated in the Bressan plain so as to have only moderate impact at Mâcon, particularly if it carries a limited volume of water. By contrast, a medium-sized flood of the lesser Saône can turn into a significant flood downstream, if the Doubs brings in a similar contribution at about the same time.

Historic floods include:
* The Lyon flood of 580
* The floods of 1602 during the autumn equinox and of 1711
* The flood of November 1840, with an estimated flow rate of almost , destroyed numerous habitations along the river valley. Many plaques marking this serious event are still visible in the villages affected. The high water measured at flood scales reached at Mâcon and at Chalon, or about respectively above normal levels).
* The flood of May 1856
* The largest floods in the last 50 years as of 2006: January 1955, March 1970, December 1981 and 1982, May 1983, March 2001 and 2006.

The reference flood in town planning is the 100-year flood. This reference was in the course of being modified as maps linked to modelling the 1840 flood in modern town planning conditions were distributed to local mayors in December 2008, and as new prevention plans were ordered for 2012.

<doc id="86828" wikidata="Q5179860" url="?curid=86828" title="Cox–Forbes theory">
<text>The Cox–Forbes theory is a long-debunked theory on the evolution of chess put forward by Captain Hiram Cox (1760–1799) and extended by Professor Duncan Forbes (1798–1868).

The theory states that a four-handed dice-chess game (Chaturaji) originated in India in approximately 3000 BC; and that arising from the results of certain rules, or the difficulty in getting enough players, the game evolved into a two-handed game (Chaturanga). On account of religious and legal objections in Hinduism to gambling, the dice were dropped from the game, making it a game of pure skill.

==Theory==
The theory arose from an article by Hiram Cox published posthumously in &quot;Asiatic Researches&quot; in 1801. Cox&#x27;s article was a commentary on an earlier article written by Sir William Jones, which included an account of the Indian text &quot;Bhavishya Purana&quot;, which he believed to date from c.3000 BC. Jones stated that this contained a description of a four-player version of chess, presented in the form of a dialogue between Yudhishthira and Vyasa. Jones argued that the four-player version described was a variation of the original two-player form of the game. Cox&#x27;s article, &quot;On the Burmha Game of Chess Compared to the Indian&quot;, proposed that the four-handed version of the game was the earliest form of chess. He states that this version &quot;is mentioned in the oldest law books and is said to have been invented by the wife of Ravan&quot;, referring to Ravana, the legendary king of Sri Lanka. Cox dates Ravan to &quot;three thousand eight hundred years ago&quot;.

Forbes developed this idea in his 1860 book &quot;The History of Chess&quot;, accepting the 3000 BC dating of the Purana. In Forbes&#x27;s explanation, the four-handed dice version is called &quot;Chaturanga&quot;, and Forbes insists that &quot;Chaturaji&quot; is a misnomer that actually refers to a victory condition in the game akin to checkmate. In his 1860 account, the players in opposite corners are allies against the other team of two. He represents this &quot;Chaturanga&quot; as gradually developing into the two-player diceless form by the time it was adopted by the Persians as &quot;Chatrang&quot;. He further asserts that this name later became &quot;Shatranj&quot; after the Arabic pronunciation.

==Refutation==
The earliest Puranas are now assigned a more conservative date of 500 BC, rather than 3000 BC. Furthermore, Albrecht Weber (1825–1901) and Dutch chess historian Antonius van der Linde (1833–97) found that the Purana quoted by Forbes did not even contain the references he claimed. While working on &quot;Geschichte und Litteratur des Schachspiels&quot; (Berlin, 1874, in two volumes), Van der Linde also found that the actual text around which Forbes had built his entire theory was the &quot;Tithitattva&quot; of Raghunandana, which was written around AD 1500, rather than 3000 BC as claimed by Forbes. Van der Linde thought that Forbes deliberately lied, and was furious. John G. White, writing in 1898, did not suggest deliberate deception on Forbes&#x27;s part, but insisted that &quot;He did not even make good use of the material known to him.&quot; As a result, the theory is now rejected by all serious chess historians.

<text>Interstate 17 (I-17) is a north–south Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Arizona. I-17&#x27;s southern terminus lies in Phoenix, at I-10/US 60 and its northern terminus is in Flagstaff, at Milton Road north of I-40.

Most of I-17 is known as the Arizona Veterans Highway. In the Phoenix metropolitan area, it is mostly known as the Black Canyon Freeway, however, the southern are part of the [[Maricopa Freeway]]. The portion of the highway south of Cordes Lakes was built along the alignment of State Route 69 (SR 69), while the northern part was built along old SR 79&#x27;s alignment. The final section of I-17 was completed in 1978.

I-17 gains more than in elevation between Phoenix at and Flagstaff at . The highway features several scenic view exits along its route that overlook the many mountains and valleys in northern Arizona.

==Route description==
I-17 is known as the Black Canyon Freeway from the northern end of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area to a point south of The Stack interchange with I-10 northwest of Downtown Phoenix. (It is accompanied by frontage roads for most of this portion, and they carry the Black Canyon &quot;Highway&quot; name to distinguish from the &quot;freeway&quot; status.) At the Durango Curve southwest of downtown, between the 19th Avenue and Buckeye Road interchanges, it picks up the designation Maricopa Freeway all the way to the southern terminus at the second I-10 junction. It is one of the metropolitan area&#x27;s primary freeways. It has two interchanges with I-10 in Phoenix.

The northwestern portion of Valley Metro&#x27;s light rail line runs over a bridge of I-17 from Mountain View Road to Metro Parkway, serving one station at Metro Parkway.

I-17 ends at Milton Road (SR 89A) north of I-40 in Flagstaff.

==History==

The I-17 corridor roughly follows the first stagecoach route through the Black Canyon, established in 1878 between Cañon (now Black Canyon City) and Prescott. A later highway through White Spar from Wickenburg to Yarnell was improved in 1925 and incorporated into US 89 in 1926.

In 1936, SR 69 was established as a state route from Phoenix north to Prescott. The road was completed by 1940 to Prescott. In 1954, a new route north to Flagstaff was established as SR 79. In May 1956, the Black Canyon Highway from Phoenix to Flagstaff was completed, but not to Interstate standards. It was incorporated into the new Interstate Highway System, established by the federal government later that year, and designated as part of I-17.

The first interchange on the Black Canyon Freeway was built in 1950 west of downtown Phoenix and was extended to Grand Avenue in 1957. The freeway was extended to McDowell Road by 1971 and out of the Phoenix suburbs by 1974, at a cost of $33 million. By 1971, I-17 had been completed from Phoenix northward to Camp Verde where a short stretch had not been completed to standards. The stretch from SR 279 (now SR 260) north to SR 179 was also complete. The largest section yet to be completed was from SR 179 north to Flagstaff. This segment was still just a two-lane roadway, but it did have full traffic interchanges built at crossroads. The portion from I-40 south to the Flagstaff Municipal Airport had been completed by this time. The final section of I-17, near Camp Verde and Montezuma Castle, began construction in February 1977 and opened to traffic in August 1978.

In 1993, officials in Arizona proposed an extension of I-17 to connect with I-15 in Utah.

The existing interchange with Happy Valley Road in Phoenix was converted to a diverging diamond interchange (DDI). The project was finished in the fall of 2020.

I-17 has the unusual distinction of starting at approximately milepost 194 instead of at milepost 0. This is a holdover from Arizona&#x27;s old system of marking mileposts, where a branching route would continue the milepost numbering of its original host, instead of starting over at zero. I-17 inherited its milepost locations from SR 69, which the freeway replaced between Phoenix and Cordes Junction. SR 69&#x27;s mileposting was such that it coincided with US 89&#x27;s mileposting, which was 201.6 where the two routes intersected. When I-17 was constructed, the existing mileposting for SR 69 was retained.

==Future==
Due to increasing weekend traffic on I-17 between the Phoenix area and northern Arizona, ADOT plans to widen a section of freeway between Anthem and Sunset Point Rest Area. The current span is only four lanes wide and is subject to frequent traffic jams on weekends as motorists travel to and from Sedona, Flagstaff, or other high country destinations. A third (flex) lane will be added in both directions between Anthem and Black Canyon City, but due to the mountainous topography north of Black Canyon City to Sunset Point, two flex lanes will be added in a separate carriageway next to the existing southbound lanes. The lanes would be allocated depending on peak traffic direction. Gates or a similar mechanism would control access to these lanes. Construction began in 2022 and is scheduled to be completed in 2025.

==Exit list==




























==Former business route==
State Business Route 17 (also known as SR 17 Bus.) was a former business loop of I-17 that served the west side of Black Canyon City, Arizona. SR 17 Bus. followed Old Black Canyon Highway (formerly SR 69 before I-17 replaced most of the route between Phoenix and Cordes Junction) from exit 242 south of town at a diamond interchange to another diamond interchange at exit 244 north of town. The business route was subsequently transferred from state to local maintenance and because of ADOT&#x27;s policy of not signing business loops on nonstate maintained roadways, the route was decommissioned in 2011.

<doc id="86833" wikidata="Q2277031" url="?curid=86833" title="Shannon (given name)">
<text>Shannon is an Irish name, Anglicised from Sionainn. Alternative spellings include Shannen, Shanon, Shannan, Seanan, and Siannon. The variant Shanna is an Anglicisation of Sionna.

&quot;Sionainn&quot; derives from the Irish name &quot;Abha na tSionainn&quot; for the River Shannon. Because the suffix &quot;ain&quot; indicates a diminutive in Irish, the name is sometimes mistranslated as &#x27;little wise one&#x27;, but means &#x27;possessor of wisdom&#x27;.

Some derive the denomination of Shannon (Irish: Sionnain) from the phrase &quot;sean-amhan&quot; or &quot;old river.&quot; Another reported derivation is from &quot;Ó Seanaigh,&quot; &quot;descendant of Seanach&quot;, which yielded the surnames Shanahan and Shannon.

==Namesake==
The name &quot;Sionainn&quot; alludes to Sionna, a goddess in Irish mythology whose name means &#x27;possessor of wisdom&#x27;. She is the namesake and matron of Sionainn, the River Shannon. The Shannon is the longest river in Ireland and in the British Isles.

Sionainn is one of seven rivers of knowledge said to flow from Connla&#x27;s Well, the well of wisdom in the Celtic Otherworld (the realm of the dead). Legends vary about the creation of the river, but they all recount the drowning of the Sionna, granddaughter of the great sea god Lir, usually at an undersea well. 

According to the legend, nine sacred hazel (or, by some accounts, rowan) trees grow near the well, and drop their bright red fruit in it and on the ground. In the well live the Salmon of Knowledge, whose wisdom comes from eating this fruit. By eating the fruit or one of the salmon, one can share in this wisdom.

==Shortened forms==
Shana and Shanna are familiar diminutives or forms of Shannon or Sionna.

==Popularity==
In the United States, the name first appeared on the Social Security Administration&#x27;s list in 1881 for males. During the 1970s, American parents began to confer the name on boys and girls alike. It was during this time that the name&#x27;s popularity peaked in the United States. In the 1990 United States Census, &quot;Shannon&quot; was the 317th most common name for American males.

<text>Interstate 19 (I-19) is a north–south Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Arizona. I-19 travels from Nogales, roughly from the Mexican border, to Tucson, at I-10. The highway also travels through the cities of Rio Rico, Green Valley, and Sahuarita.

Having a total length of just over , I-19 is the eighth-shortest primary (two-digit) Interstate Highway in the contiguous 48 states, where only I-86 (Idaho), I-11 (Nevada), I-2 (Texas), I-42 (North Carolina), I-14 (Texas), I-97 (Maryland), and I-87 (North Carolina) are shorter.

While the highway is short, it is a very important corridor, serving as a fast route from Tucson and Phoenix (via I-10) to the Mexican border. The highway is a portion of the US section of the CANAMEX Corridor, a trade corridor that stretches north from Mexico across the US to the Canadian province of British Columbia.

==Route description==

In Nogales, the southern terminus of I-19 is at West Crawford Street, adjacent to the international port of entry, and southbound travelers can continue into Heroica Nogales, Mexico, via state-maintained surface roads, and connect with Federal Highway 15 (Fed. 15) either to the south or west of Nogales, Sonora.

Starting from the southern terminus at kilometer post 0 (not milepost 0), I-19 initially heads briefly south then west on surface streets, navigating its way through the town of Nogales for before becoming an Interstate-grade freeway and making the turn to head north toward Tucson. It has interchanges with two other state highways near the southern end of the route, State Route 189 (SR 189) at exit 4 and SR 289 at exit 12. The interchange with SR 189 at exit 4 both serves to funnel traffic so as to bypass around Nogales and Heroica Nogales for travelers bound to or from Hermosillo or Mexico City and provides for the continuous flow of freight and truck traffic through the larger Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry to Fed. 15, which has its northern terminus at the US–Mexico border with SR 189 and its southern terminus away in Mexico City. After exiting Nogales to the north, I-19 passes near and around a series of sparsely-populated towns and retirement communities along the banks of the Santa Cruz River, including Rio Rico, Tubac, Amado, Green Valley, and Sahuarita. For several miles near Amado and Green Valley, the eastward view from I-19 provides scenic views of Madera Canyon and the Santa Rita Mountains in the Coronado National Forest.
Just before entering Tucson, I-19 passes through the eastern section of the San Xavier Indian Reservation where it makes its only crossing of the Santa Cruz River. As I-19 enters the Tucson city limits, it has an interchange with SR 86 at exit 99 before reaching its northern terminus at an interchange with I-10.

Nearly the entire route of I-19 follows, or is adjacent to, the former routing of US Route 89 (US 89) and the Santa Cruz River, which flows northward from Mexico, through Tucson and usually disperses into the desert between Marana and the Gila River, southeast of Phoenix. Most of the time, much of the river is dry, but heavy storms can cause it to overflow its banks, flooding farmland before reaching the Gila River.

===Signage===
I-19 is unique among US Interstates because signed distances are given in meters (hundreds or thousands as distance-to-exit indications) or kilometers (as distance-to-destination indications), and not miles. However, the speed limit signs give speeds in miles per hour. According to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), metric signs were originally placed because of the push toward the metric system in the US at the time of the original construction of the highway.

I-19 had originally been signed as it was constructed, in a series of small signing contracts that used customary units. In 1980, ADOT awarded a single contract to install new signs which used metric units, to overlay customary-unit expressions on some existing signs with metric-unit expressions, to install kilometer posts, and to provide bilingual signing in select locations. The signing scheme used in 1980 provided explicit units on advance guide signs, but not on interchange sequence signs or post-interchange confirmation (distance) signs.

The expressions on advance guide signs were of the form &quot;2 km&quot; () for distances over and &quot;500 m&quot; () for distances under , with no provision for fractional kilometrages. On advance guide signs, the metric unit expressions &quot;km&quot; and &quot;m&quot; were placed on the baseline where &quot;MILES&quot; would otherwise have gone but were sized so that their lowercase loop height matched the uppercase letter height of &quot;MILES&quot; on customary-unit signs.

The exception was a handful of advance guide signs for the SR 86 (Ajo Way) exit, which used &quot;KM&quot; (in uppercase, contrary to SI nomenclature) on the same baseline and at the same letter height as &quot;MILES&quot;. The 1980 signing plans also provided design details for speed limit and advisory speed signs using metric units, with the limit values enclosed in a red circle on the speed limit sign and a black circle on the yellow-background advisory signs. These speed signs all had explicit units, with &quot;km/h&quot; below the circle enclosing the limit value. However, the advisory signs were canceled by change order and not installed.

Had the metric speed limit sign been installed, the signed speed limit on I-19 would have been , which is a close soft-conversion of the then-existing national maximum speed limit. As Arizona&#x27;s current maximum speed limit is , the metric equivalent would most likely read . Information signs, to three distinct designs, were also placed at various locations on or near I-19 to advise motorists that the highway was signed in metric. Notwithstanding the metric legends, the signing plans were dimensioned entirely in feet and inches.

In 1999, ADOT awarded two contracts (administered as a single construction project) to renew the signs along the full length of I-19. The general approach toward metric signing differed from that taken in 1980. Explicit units were given not just on advance guide signs, but also on interchange sequence signs, post-interchange confirmation signs, and community interchange signs (the last-listed had not been used in 1980). On the distance signs, &quot;km&quot; appeared after each kilometer measurement except when one or more of the distances was a fractional kilometer.

In such cases, all the distances were given in meters with &quot;meters&quot; (written out in full, not &quot;m&quot;) after each distance value. On distance signs in general, &quot;km&quot; or &quot;meters&quot; appeared on the same baseline and with the same letter height as the distance values, while advance guide signs were formatted as in 1980. Since a typical ADOT freeway guide sign rehabilitation contract also replaces surface road signing near those roads&#x27; interchanges with the freeway, metric-unit signs also appeared on local roads near I-19, giving distances in kilometers to tourist attractions such as Mission San Xavier del Bac.

As was the case in 1980, the signing plans were dimensioned in feet and inches. However, a number of signs near the Valencia Road interchange were replaced or amended when it was converted from a partial cloverleaf interchange to a single-point urban interchange in 2000. One of these signs has a fractional kilometrage greater than , rendered as &quot;1500 m&quot; (), while others use &quot;m&quot; rather than &quot;meters&quot; as the unit expression. Metric-unit expressions on the advance guide signs installed or modified as part of this contract appear on the same baseline as the metric values, rather than on a raised baseline as on other I-19 advance guide signs. Again, the plans were dimensioned in feet and inches.

Citing motorist confusion arising from the metric signs on I-19, ADOT&#x27;s Tucson district announced that new signs on I-19 would use US customary units. To avoid the cost of replacing the metric signs all at once, signs would be replaced in specific areas of the freeway during construction projects in those areas. New signs were put into place between exit 99 (Ajo Way) and exit 101 (I-10) in 2004 after the completion of the new I-10/I-19 interchange.

, the remainder of the project has been stalled due to local opposition, particularly from businesses that would have to change their directions.

A reconstruction project at the Interstate&#x27;s northern terminus with I-10 in Tucson (at the interchange commonly called the Crossing) began in 2002 and was completed in August 2004.

==History==
The first sections of I-19 to be opened to traffic were a stub from I-10 to Valencia Road, in 1962 and a stretch in Green Valley in 1963. The freeway between Rio Rico and Nogales was completed in 1974. The major section between Green Valley and Rio Rico was finished in 1978. The official completion date of the I-19 segment between Tucson (km 100) and Green Valley (actually Helmet Peak Road at km 75) was February 12, 1972. A 1978 project report for ADOT lists the entire I-19 project as &quot;completed&quot;, which includes segments between Green Valley and Nogales.

==Future==
I-19 is a very heavily traveled corridor in the Tucson metro area. The freeway is currently two lanes in both directions for most of its length, with the exception of the interchange with I-10 up until Irvington Road, where it transitions to four lanes. Current plans call for widening from Irvington Road to Valencia Road, bringing the freeway to three lanes in each direction. Future plans include expansion to up to five lanes in each direction by 2030 from the crossing with I-10 to San Xavier Road.

I-19 is also part of the proposed I-11 corridor between Nogales and Sahuarita.

==Business routes==
Historically, I-19 has had two business loops, both of which are former sections of US 89, SR 93, and SR 789. One is currently active while the other is decommissioned. Both business loops are currently and formerly recognized under the unsigned designation Arizona State Route 19 Business (also known as State Business Route 19).

===Nogales loop===

Interstate 19 Business (I-19 Bus.) begins at the Mexican border in Nogales near the southern end of the Interstate. I-19 Bus. follows Grand Avenue in Nogales and has intersections with SR 82 and SR 189 before terminating at I-19 just north of Nogales. The route follows the former alignment of US 89, SR 93, and SR 789, back when all three highways traversed through southern Arizona. The route has been commissioned as I-19 Bus. since US 89 was decommissioned from southern Arizona in 1992.

===Sahuarita–Tucson loop===
Interstate 19 Business (I-19 Bus.) began at I-19 exit 69 in Green Valley at West Duval Mine Road and South Nogales Highway. I-19 Bus. followed Nogales Highway north through unincorporated Pima County and Sahuarita into Tucson. In Tucson, I-19 Bus. curved from Nogales Highway onto South 6th Avenue where it served as the eastern terminus of SR 86 at West Ajo Way, before terminating at I-10 exit 261 and South 6th Avenue in South Tucson. The route follows the former alignment of US 89, SR 93, and SR 789, back when all three highways traversed through southern Arizona. The route was commissioned as I-19 Bus. since US 89 was decommissioned from southern Arizona in 1992. In 2002, the state handed maintenance of I-19 Bus. between Los Reales Road and I-10 to the city of Tucson. The rest of the route was handed over to Pima County and the city of Sahuarita in 2004. This also meant the designation was retired from the state highway system completely.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Smertrios or Smertrius was a god worshipped in Gaul and Noricum. In Roman times he was equated with Mars . His name contains the same root as that of the goddess Rosmerta and may mean &quot;The Purveyor&quot; or &quot;The Provider&quot;, a title rather than a true name. Smertulitanus may be a variant name for the same god.

Smertrius is one of the Gaulish gods depicted on the Pillar of the Boatmen, discovered in Paris. Here is depicted as a well-muscled bearded man confronting a snake which rears up in front of him. The god brandishes an object which has usually been interpreted as a club but which rather resembles a torch or firebrand.

The normal interpretation of the god&#x27;s attribute as a club has led to the identification, by modern scholars, of Smertrius and Hercules. Other evidence links Smertrius with the Celtic version of Mars: at Möhn near Trier, a spring sanctuary was dedicated to Mars Smertrius and his consort Ancamna. Coins found here indicate that there was a shrine here before the Roman period. Another Treveran inscription links Mars and Smertrius. Smertrius himself is known outside Gaul, for example on a fragmentary inscription at Grossbach in Austria.

<doc id="86846" wikidata="Q1783814" url="?curid=86846" title="Tailtiu">
<text>Tailtiu or Tailltiu (; modern spelling: Tailte) is the name of a presumed goddess from Irish mythology. The goddess&#x27;s name is linked to Teltown (&lt; OI &quot;Óenach Tailten&quot;) in Co. Meath, site of the Óenach Tailten. A legendary dindsenchas &quot;lore of places&quot; poem relates a myth connecting the presumed goddess Tailtiu with the site. However, linguistic analysis of the name reveals that Tailtiu as a place-name derives from a loan word of Brythonic origin represented by the Welsh &quot;telediw&quot; &quot;well formed, beautiful.&quot; The mythological character of Tailtiu likely derives her name from the place-name.

==In Irish mythology==
According to the Book of Invasions, Tailtiu was the wife of Eochaid mac Eirc, last Fir Bolg High King of Ireland, who named his capital after her (Teltown, between Navan and Kells). She survived the invasion of the Tuatha Dé Danann and became the foster mother of Lugh.

Tailtiu is said to have died of exhaustion after clearing the plains of Ireland for agriculture. Lugh established a harvest festival and funeral games, &quot;Áenach Tailteann&quot;, in her honour, which continued to be celebrated as late as the 18th century.

==In Irish history==
The first &quot;Áenach Tailteann&quot;, later the Tailtin Fair, was held at Teltown. Historically, the Áenach Tailteann was a time for contests of strength and skill, and a favoured time for contracting marriages and winter lodgings. A peace was declared at the festival, and religious celebrations were also held. Aspects of the festival survive in the celebrations of Lughnasadh, and were revived as the Teltown Games for a period in the twentieth century.

A similar Lughnasadh festival was held at Carmun (whose exact location is under dispute). Similar to Tailtiu, the festival at Carmun is celebrated by a dindsenchas poem that provides a psedo-etymology for the site. The poem claims that the festival is named after the mythological Carmun, in a tale similar to that of Tailtiu. But as with Tailtiu, this mythological figure likely derives its name from the place-name.

In historical times the town of Tailtiu was where the principal assembly of the early Uí Néill dynasties was held.

From the Locus Project at CELT, Tailte had one or two raths [residence(s)] in Munster:

* ráith canann: a ráith of queen Tailte, LL 201; cf. Rathcannon tl., Co. Limerick
* ráith con: rath of queen Tailte, LL 201; in Tuath Tailten, UM 165b, Lec. 514, Stowe D ii 2, 656; cf. Rathcon, in dry. and d. Cashel, Tax

Rathcanann and Rath Con may or may not be identical.

<doc id="86848" wikidata="Q250060" url="?curid=86848" title="Taranis">
<text>Taranis (sometimes Taranus or Tanarus) is a Celtic thunder god attested in literary and epigraphic sources.

The Roman poet Lucan&#x27;s epic &quot;Pharsalia&quot; mentions Taranis, Esus, and Teutates as gods to whom the Gauls sacrificed humans. This rare mention of Celtic gods under their native names in a Latin text has been the subject of much comment. Almost as often commented on are the scholia to Lucan&#x27;s poem (early medieval, but relying on earlier sources) which tell us the nature of these sacrifices: in particular, that victims of Taranis were burned in a hollow wooden container. This sacrifice has been compared with the wicker man described by Caesar.

These scholia also tell us that Taranis was perhaps either equated by the Romans with Dis Pater, Roman god of the underworld, or Jupiter, Roman god of weather. Scholars have preferred the latter equation to the former, as Taranis is also equated with Jupiter in inscriptions, but both have been compared with Caesar&#x27;s enigmatic references to a Gaulish Jupiter and a Gaulish Dis Pater.

The equation of Taranis with Jupiter has caused some scholars to identify Tarannis with the &quot;wheel god&quot; of the Celts. This god, known only from iconographic sources, is depicted with a spoked wheel and the attributes of Jupiter (including a thunderbolt). No direct evidence links Taranis with the wheel god, so some scholars have expressed scepticism about this identification.

Various inscriptions attest to Taranis&#x27;s worship, dating from the 4th century BCE to the 3rd century CE. Scholars have drawn contradictory conclusions about the importance of Taranis from the distribution of these inscriptions.

==Name==

===Etymology and development===
Taranis&#x27;s name derives from proto-Celtic (&quot;thunder&quot;), which in turn derives from the proto-Indo-European root (&quot;to thunder&quot;). Through the proto-Celtic etymon, the theonym is cognate with words for thunder in Old Irish (), Old Breton (), Middle Welsh (), and (as a loan word into a non-Celtic language) the Gascon dialect of French ().

During the development of Celtic, the word for thunder seem to have undergone a metathesis (transposition of syllables) from to . The question of whether the Chester altar (discussed below) should be read as attesting to an unmetathesised form of the god&#x27;s name, Tanaris, was for a long time controversial. However, the discovery of a dedication to (&quot;Jupiter Tanaris&quot;) in Dalmatia confirms that such a form did exist.

===Thunder god===
The association with thunder, suggested by the etymology of Taranis&#x27;s name, is confirmed by his equation with Jupiter. Taranis&#x27;s name corresponds etymologically to that of the Germanic god Donar (i.e., Thor). Peter Jackson has conjectured that the theonyms Taranis and Donar (as well as perhaps the epithet Tonans of Jupiter) originated as a result of the &quot;fossilization of an original epithet or epiklesis&quot; of the proto-Indo-European thunder god *Perkʷūnos. Calvert Watkins compared Taranis&#x27;s name with the name of the Hittite weather god Tarḫunna. However, John T. Koch pointed out that an etymology linking the two theonyms would reverse the order of the metathesis (so that Taranis precedes Tanaris) and therefore compromise the proto-Indo-European etymology.

==Lucan and the scholia==
===Lucan===
Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; or &quot;De Bello Civili&quot; (&quot;On the Civil War&quot;) is an epic poem, begun about 61 CE, on the events of Caesar&#x27;s civil war (49–48 BCE). The passage relevant to Taranis occurs in &quot;Gallic excursus&quot;, an epic catalogue detailing the rejoicing of the various Gaulish peoples after Caesar removed his legions from Gaul (where they were intended to control the natives) to Italy. The passage thus brings out two themes of Lucan&#x27;s work, the barbarity of the Gauls and the unpatriotism of Caesar.

The substance of the last few lines is this: unspecified Gauls, who made human sacrifices to their gods Teutates, Esus, and Taranis, were overjoyed by the exit of Caesar&#x27;s troops from their territory. The reference to &quot;Diana of the Scythians&quot; refers to the human sacrifices demanded by Diana at her temple in Scythian Taurica, well known in antiquity. That Lucan says little about these gods is not surprising. Lucan&#x27;s aims were poetic, and not historical or ethnographic. The poet never travelled to Gaul and relied on secondary sources for his knowledge of Gaulish religion. When he neglects to add more, this may well reflect the limits of his knowledge.

We have no literary sources prior to Lucan which mention these deities, and the few which mention them after Lucan (in the case of Taranis, Papias alone) rely on this passage. The secondary sources on Celtic religion which Lucan relied on in this passage (perhaps Posidonius) have not come down to us. This passage is one of the very few in classical literature in which Celtic gods are mentioned under their native names, rather than identified with Greek or Roman gods. This departure from classical practice likely had poetic intent: emphasising the barbarity and exoticness the Gauls, whom Caesar had left to their own devices.

Some scholars, such as de Vries, have argued that the three gods mentioned together here (Esus, Teutates, and Taranis) formed a divine triad in ancient Gaulish religion. However, there is little other evidence associating these gods with each other. Other scholars, such as Graham Webster, emphasise that Lucan may as well have chosen these deity-names for their scansion and harsh sound.

===Scholia===
Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; was a very popular school text in late antiquity and the medieval period. This created a demand for commentaries and scholia dealing with difficulties in the work, both in grammar and subject matter. The earliest Lucan scholia that have come down to us are the &quot;Commenta Bernensia&quot; and the &quot;Adnotationes super Lucanum&quot;, both from manuscripts datable to the 10th and 11th centuries. Also important are comments from a Cologne codex (the &quot;Glossen ad Lucan&quot;), dating to the 11th and 12th centuries. In spite of their late date, these scholia are thought to incorporate very ancient material, some of it now lost. The &quot;Commenta&quot; and &quot;Adnotationes&quot; are known to contain material at least as old as Servius the Grammarian (4th century CE). Below are excerpts from these scholia relevant to Taranis:

The first excerpt, about the sacrifice to Taranis, comes from a passage in the &quot;Commenta&quot; which details the human sacrifices offered each of to the three gods (persons were suspended from trees and dismembered for Esus, persons were drowned in a barrel for Teutates). This passage, which is not paralleled anywhere else in classical literature, has been much the subject of much commentary. It seems to have been preserved in the &quot;Commenta&quot; by virtue of its author&#x27;s preference for factual (over grammatical) explanation. The &quot;Adnotationes&quot;, by comparison, tell us nothing about the sacrifices to Esus, Teutates, and Taranis beyond that they were each murderous.
The &quot;Commenta&quot; tells us that as sacrifices to Taranis, several people were burned in a wooden . The Latin word is translated above as &quot;tub&quot;, but it could applied to any hollow container. In various settings, the term could be used to mean a ship&#x27;s hull, a bath tub, a drainage basin, a canoe, or a beehive. Miranda Green linked this sacrifice with the wicker man, the well-known wooden figure in which (according to Caesar and Strabo) humans were burned as sacrifices.

The &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; of Taranis as Jupiter, given by all three commentaries, is otherwise attested in epigraphy, and agrees with our understanding of Taranis as a thunder god. By contrast, the &quot;interpretatio&quot; of Taranis as Dis Pater, which only the &quot;Commenta&quot; gives, is quite obscure. It is not given in any inscription, and we do not know what Taranis had to do with the underworld. Manfred Hainzmann points out that Dis was associated in Latin literature with the night sky and night thunderstorms. Statius, for example, refers to Dis Pater as the &quot;thunderer of the underworld&quot; (&quot;Thebiad&quot;, 11.209).

In the course of giving the &quot;interpretatio&quot; of Taranis as Jupiter, the scholiast of the &quot;Commenta&quot; mentions that Taranis was &quot;leader of wars&quot;. This is an unusual trait to associate with Jupiter rather than Mars (Roman god of war), though the Romans occasionally gave Jupiter martial functions. Hofeneder has associated the comment that Taranis was &quot;appeased with human heads&quot; with this martial function, as the (pre-Roman) Celtic custom of carrying off their foes&#x27; heads in battle is well-attested. The scholiast describes a transition from human to animal sacrifice, probably connected to the suppression of human sacrifice in Gaul in the Imperial period.

Caesar states in his &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; that the Gauls regarded a Gaulish god (whom Caesar equated with Dis Pater) as their ancestor. As Taranis is the only Celtic god equated with Dis Pater in ancient literary sources, Taranis has often been a cited as a candidate for Gaulish Dis Pater. On the other hand, Caesar also briefly refers to an unnamed Gaulish god who &quot;rules over all the gods&quot; (), and whom he equates with Jupiter. It has been suggested that Taranis is behind this description. The similarity between Caesar&#x27;s description of Gaulish Jupiter, and the &quot;Commenta&quot; description of Taranis as &quot;chief of the heavenly gods&quot; (), has been noted, though this may reflect reliance on Caesar&#x27;s text or a routine characterisation of the Roman god Jupiter.

==Taranis and the wheel god==
The wheel god () is a figure of Celtic religious iconography, a god wielding a spoked wheel. The wheel god is often depicted with the attributes of Jupiter: thunderbolt, sceptre, and eagle. The spoked wheel was an important religious motif for the Celts. Metal votive wheels (known as &quot;&quot;) are known from Iron Age Europe. The &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot; lists 15 depictions of the wheel god. Some are statuettes of the god dressed in Gaulish garb, with a wheel in one hand and a thunderbolt in the other. A mosaic from Saint-Romain-en-Gal shows a woman and a man leaving sacrifices to such a statuette. An obscure scene on the Gundestrup cauldron perhaps shows a leaping devotee offering a wheel to the wheel god. The so-called Jupiter columns, religious monuments widespread in Germania, are frequently crowned with an equestrian god, who sometimes wields a wheel.

Because both were identified with Jupiter, Taranis has been repeatedly equated with the wheel god (for example, by Pierre Lambrechts, , and Anne Ross). However, nothing connects the gods directly. No inscription links Taranis with wheel iconography. Some scholars have rejected this equation. Green rejects it, and argues that the wheel god was a solar deity; naturally identifiable with Jupiter, but distinct from the thunder god Taranis. and both express scepticism in their studies of Jupiter columns in Germany. Árpád M. Nagy described the equation as &quot;probable, but not binding&quot;.

In any case, the combination of the thunderbolt and wheel as attributes is not unique to one deity: Hercules is occasionally depicted with these attributes in the Latin West, and a female deity with a thunderbolt and wheel is known from a statue in Autun.

The inscription is now badly weathered and illegible, but was read and recorded in the 17th century. The unusual form of the god&#x27;s name here (Tanarus) has led to repeated suggestions of a misspelling on the part of the engraver or misreading in the original autopsy. However, the discovery of a dedication to in Dalmatia has somewhat obviated these concerns.

A few different forms of the god&#x27;s name are known from epigraphy. The spelling Taranus, which is much more common than Taranis in epigraphy, is an older form than Taranis. There is the above-discussed un-metathesised form Taranus. There is also Taranuc(n)us (&quot;son/descendant of Taranus&quot;), known from two inscriptions of Germania Superior, which attaches a patronymic suffix to Taranis&#x27;s name.

Different scholars have drawn different conclusions about Taranis&#x27;s importance and the geographical extent of his worship from his epigraphic attestations. Marion Euskirchen calls the epigraphic evidence &quot;scanty and altogether not unambiguous&quot;, which &quot;suggests a rather limited significance of the god within a number of tribal federations&quot;. Hofeneder, on the other hand, states that Taranis is &quot;attested surprisingly often&quot; for a Celtic god, a fact which &quot;clearly indicates that he must have been a deity worshipped in large parts of &quot;&quot; and over a long period of time&quot;.

<text>Tarvos Trigaranus or Taruos Trigaranos is a divine figure who appears on a relief panel of the Pillar of the Boatmen as a bull with three cranes perched on his back. He stands under a tree, and on an adjacent panel, the god Esus is chopping down a tree, possibly a willow, with an axe.

In the Gaulish language, &quot;taruos&quot; means &quot;bull,&quot; found in Old Irish as &quot;tarb&quot; (/tarβ/), in Modern Irish/Gaelic as &quot;tarbh&quot; and in Welsh as &quot;tarw&quot; (compare &quot;bull&quot; in other Indo-European languages such as Latin &quot;taurus&quot; from Greek &quot;ταύρος&quot; or Lithuanian &quot;taŭras&quot;). &quot;Garanus&quot; is the crane (&quot;garan&quot; in Welsh, Old Cornish and Breton; see also &quot;geranos&quot;, the ritual &quot;crane dance&quot; of ancient Greece). &quot;Treis&quot;, or &quot;tri-&quot; in compound words, is the number three (cf. Irish &quot;trí&quot;, Welsh &quot;tri&quot;).

A pillar from Trier shows a man with an axe cutting down a tree in which sit three birds and a bull&#x27;s head. The juxtaposition of images has been compared to the Tarvos Trigaranus and Esus panels on the Boatmen monument. It is possible that statues of a bull with three horns, such as the one from Autun (Burgundy, France, anciently &quot;Augustodunum&quot;) are related to this deity.

The Saturnian moon Tarvos is named after Tarvos Trigaranus, following a convention of naming members of its moon group after Gallic mythological figures.

<doc id="86864" wikidata="Q3402227" url="?curid=86864" title="Twm Siôn Cati">
<text>Twm Siôn Cati is a prominent figure in Welsh folklore. While many tales of cunning and trickery have been associated with Twm, he is also said to have been a respected antiquary, genealogist and poet and to have risen to the position of magistrate and mayor of Brecon as well as being a relative of the occultist John Dee.

Due to legends of Twm stealing from the rich and powerful and helping the poor and needy, he became known in the 19th century as &quot;The Welsh Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;The Welsh Rob Roy&quot;.

== Historicity ==
The character of Twm Siôn Cati is based on a real person named Thomas Jones (1532–1609). Jones was said to be a landowner, an antiquary, genealogist and bard, whose manuscripts are kept at the National Library of Wales. He is also recorded as marrying Joan, the daughter of John Price an advisor to Thomas Cromwell during the dissolution of the monasteries. Price was also an antiquarian and a collector of rare Welsh documents, such as the Black Book of Carmarthen. Jones is said to have been a steward who &quot;often had recourse to the law&quot;. He is also said to have been pardoned of his offences in 1559, being named as &quot;Thomas Johns alias Catty&quot;.
Various manuscripts ascribed to Thomas Jones begin around 1570 and he is known to have assisted George Owen and Lewys Dwnn and the officers of the Heralds College. Thomas Jones is known to have visited Dee in London in 1590 and at his home in Mortlake six years later, the two also corresponded with each other in 1597 in which Dee referred to him as &quot;my cousin&quot;. Jones was also steward of Caron in 1601 and died in 1609, when his will was proved at Carmarthen.

It is considered unlikely however, that the numerous tales attributed to Twm Siôn Cati were the exploits of this one man but rather a number of raiders and highwaymen (possibly with similar or identical names to that of Thomas Jones) who operated in the Tregaron area.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Twm is said to have been born at Porth y Ffynnon on the outskirts of Tregaron.

Although John Dee recorded Twm&#x27;s date of birth as 1532 (either 1 August or 10 August), there is little written record of his birth and childhood, suggesting he may have been illegitimate. While his mother was Cati Jones of Tregaron, his father is sometimes stated to be Siôn ap Dafydd ap Madog ap Hywel Moetheu of Porth-y-ffin, Tregaron.

As an illegitimate son, he unofficially took both his father and mother&#x27;s names, becoming known as Thomas Jones in English, but as Twm Siôn Cati in common Welsh convention.

In the tale told by Llewelyn Prichard, Twm is the illegitimate son of Cati Jones following attentions from John Wynn of Gwydir (John &quot;Wynn&quot; ap Maredudd); the Welsh forms of the names of his parents became incorporated into his name.

=== Robber and exile ===
In the tale told by Llewelyn Prichard, he grows up in Tregaron and after a spell working for a farmer, he works for a local landowner. He is trusted to take a large sum of the squire&#x27;s money to England. The journey is fraught with encounters with highwaymen, footpads, and villains, all of whom Twm is able to best.

George Borrow disapproved of the veneer of respectability in Prichard&#x27;s book: &quot;&quot;Its grand fault is endeavouring to invest Twm Shon&quot; (a name Borrow spells with varying consistency) &quot;with a character of honesty, and to make his exploits appear rather those of a wild young waggish fellow than of a robber.&quot; According to the stories which Borrow picked up around Tregaron, Twm&#x27;s career was more straightforward. &quot;Between eighteen and nineteen, in order to free himself and his mother from poverty which they had long endured, he adopted the profession of a thief, and soon became celebrated through the whole of Wales for the cleverness and adroitness which he exercised in his calling&quot;&quot;.

He was supposedly a Protestant by faith at a time when Mary I of England, a Catholic monarch, ruled and he had to gain an income as best he could, choosing robbery as his trade as his religion had him marked out as a rebel already and his low status meant that he could not rely on any advantage or protection from others. As a young man he fled to Geneva in 1557 to escape the law. After the accession of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I, he was able to obtain a pardon for his thievery, enabling his return to Wales in 1559.

=== Marriages and children ===
Twm was active in west Wales, with forays into England, in the late sixteenth century. Stories centre on his tricks, with which he outwitted law-abiding people and criminals alike.

In the tale told by Llewelyn Prichard, Twm woos and eventually marries the Lady of Ystrad-ffin and subsequently becomes a magistrate and mayor of Brecon.

The name of his first wife is unknown; his second, whom he married in 1607, was Joan, widow of Thomas Williams of Ystrad-ffin and daughter of Sir John Price of Brecon Priory (1502?-1555).

It is rumoured that Twm had a number of illegitimate children during his time as a highway man. To hide the true identity of their father, the children were given religious or biblical surnames.

== Legends ==
Borrow recounted a story in which a farmer is hunting Twm over the theft of a bullock. The farmer reaches Twm&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house and asks whether Twm Shone Catti (another of Borrow&#x27;s spellings) lives there. A beggar answers that he does, and agrees to hold the farmer&#x27;s horse and whip for him. As the farmer goes into the house, the beggar jumps onto the horse: it is Twm. He gallops to the house of the farmer and tells the farmer&#x27;s wife that the farmer is in trouble, needs money urgently, and has sent Twm to fetch it, with the horse and whip to prove that the message really came from the farmer. The farmer&#x27;s wife pays up. Twm, now in possession of the farmer&#x27;s money and horse, hastily departs for London, later selling the horse.

A tale recounted by Meyrick recalls how Twm was asked by a poor man to steal a pitcher for him. They went together to a merchant where Twm started belittling the man&#x27;s wares. Having told his friend secretly to take the pitcher of his choice, Twm distracted the merchant by telling him there was a hole in one of the pitchers, which the man denied. Twm desired him to put his hand in the pitcher to test it and the man still denied there was a hole. Twm then asked him how, if there was no hole, could he have put his hand inside? By this time his friend had disappeared with his pitcher, undetected.

A tale from Prichard&#x27;s book involves an occasion when Twm is staying in an inn overnight and realises other people are planning to rob him the following day after he sets off. He has a large sum of money with him. The following morning he behaves as though his money is in the pack-saddle of his horse. When the highwayman catches up, Twm drops the saddle in the middle of a pool. The highwayman wades into the pool to fetch it. Twm takes the opportunity to make off with the highwayman&#x27;s horse. A complication arises because the horse responds to the voice of the highwayman crying &quot;Stop!&quot; Luckily Twm, in terror, happens to shout a word which makes the horse gallop on again, and he is conveyed to safety.

Another tale recounts how Twm waylaid a rich squire, who was accompanied by his daughter, Twm was so smitten with her that he returned her jewellery to her and attempted to woo her, against her father&#x27;s opposition and, initially, her own. One full moon shortly after the robbery, he crept to her window, roused her from sleep, caught her hand at the window and kissed it, refusing to let her go until she promised to marry him. She wouldn&#x27;t promise so Twm drew his dagger, drew blood on her wrist and threatened to sever her hand unless she assented to marriage forthwith. She agreed to marry him and she kept her hand. Their marriage followed soon after, despite her father&#x27;s views and the directness of Twm&#x27;s courtship methods. The girl was supposedly the widow of the sheriff of Carmarthen. Through this marriage Twm is supposed to have gained respectability, eventually becoming a justice of the peace, sitting in judgement on others, a position he held until his death aged 79.

==Literature==
It is likely that a corpus of oral tales had existed for some time before the eighteenth century, when the character begins to appear in literature. There are a number of similarities between the legends of Twm Siôn Cati and the lead character of Henry Fielding&#x27; 1749 novel, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling. These include the circumstances of his birth, a noble father, a bucolic setting in the &quot;far west&quot;, romantic liaisons followed by the meeting and wooing of a lady, exile from their home country, a rags-to-riches narrative structure and even the character&#x27;s names (Thomas Jones).

English-language pamphlet, &quot;Tomshone Catty&#x27;s Tricks&quot; was printed in 1763. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the early nineteenth century that Twm became a feature of literary works. Another pamphlet, &quot;Y Digrifwr&quot; was published in 1811. Which was subtitled as &quot;The jokester: a collection of feats and tricks of Thomas Jones of Tregaron, Cardiganshire, he who is generally known under the name Twm Sion Catti&quot;. The journalist William Frederick Deacon dedicated a chapter of his 1823 work, &quot;The Innkeeper’s Album&quot; to &quot;Twm John Catty: The Welch Rob Roy&quot;. While the collection is of South Wales folklore, the chapter title was a clear attempt to copy Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s success in repurposing the Scottish hero for nineteenth century British readers.

This was soon followed in 1828 by the initial publication of TJ Llewelyn Prichard&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures and Vagaries of Twm Shon Catti, descriptive of Life in Wales&quot;. George Borrow, walking through Wild Wales in 1854, heard several tales about Twm from a fellow-walker on the way to Tregaron and later read what was probably Prichard&#x27;s book.

This verse shows how much fear the local residents had of him:

There is a great cheer and shout
in Ystrad-ffin this year,
And the snakestones melt into lead
By the osom of Twm Siôn Cati.

H. Parry-Williams (ed.), Old Penitentiary (The Welsh Book Club, 1940), pgs. 159.

T. Llew Jones has published three Welsh-language novels about him namely Y Ffordd Dangerous, Amongst Thieves and Dial at Last.

==Television==

The 1978 BBC drama Hawkmoor is based on the activities of Twm Siôn Cati. Created by Lynn Hughes and starring John Ogwen as Twm and Jane Asher as Lady Johane Williams, the drama depicted Twm as a Welsh freedom fighter protecting Welsh people from the repression of the English Sheriff John Stedman (Jack May) and the cruel (Catholic) Vicar Davyd (Philip Madoc).

A paperback () also written by Lynn Hughes was released in the same year to accompany the television series.

==Landscape==

A number of areas have been associated with Twm Sion Cati&#x27;s hideouts, including two caves, one on the outskirts of Tregaron at Ystrad-ffin and another at Rhandir-mwyn near Llandovery.

Twm Siôn Cati&#x27;s Cave at Ystrad-ffin became popular with nineteenth century tourists, wishing to trace the footsteps of Twm who was said to have hidden in the cave while wooing Joan (the widow of Ystrad-ffin), and again when escaping from Llandovery fair.

There is a steep ascent to the cave, which is surrounded by trees and boulders, and it is necessary to crawl inside. Part of the cave roof has collapsed but the cave itself has obviously been visited over many years, as evidenced by the carvings – one reads 1832. It overlooks the confluence of the River Tywi with the River Pysgotwr. The &quot;Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales&quot; notes that Prichard&#x27;s vivid descriptions of Twm&#x27;s cave suggest the author knew the area around Rhandir-mwyn well. Historical accounts have been published by Lynne Hughes (whose book &quot;Hawkmoor&quot;, was serialised by the BBC in 1977) and three by Welsh-language children&#x27;s author T. Llew Jones.

Today, the cave is part of the Gwenffrwd-Dinas RSPB reserve.

==Festivals==
The community of Tregaron held a year of activities to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of Twm Siôn Cati in 2009.
The year saw activities such as an exhibition at Tregaron Kite Centre (the red kite is common in the area), a charity walk from his cave to his birthplace and the launching of four books. Local artists created souvenir items. A wood-carving of Twm created by Grace Young Monaghan was placed on Tregaron Square.

An international Twm Siôn Cati Day is held each 17 May. A Twm Siôn Cati Community Prize is presented annually to a Tregaron Primary School pupil for doing a good deed in Tregaron. A Twm Town Trail, designed by the school&#x27;s pupils, is walked by hundreds of people every year.

<text>In ancient Celtic polytheism, Verbeia was a goddess worshipped in Roman Britain. She is known from a single altar-stone dedicated to her at Ilkley (RIB 635). She is considered to have been a deification of the River Wharfe.

An image of a woman (also from Ilkley) may represent the goddess: she is depicted with an overlarge head and schematic features; she wears a long, pleated robe and she has two large snakes, represented as geometric zig-zags, which she grasps, one in each hand.

==Origins==
The stone bearing the image thought to represent Verbeia now stands inside All Saints&#x27; Parish Church and an altar stone dedicated to the goddess is on display in Ilkley Manor House. Both buildings are situated on the site of a Roman fort. The fort has been claimed to be named &#x27;Verbeia&#x27; (not Olicana, as is generally thought). It was the Second Cohort of Lingones troops stationed here during the second century AD who inscribed the above-mentioned altar-stone.

Anne Ross compares this image with one of a goddess found in Mavilly-Mandelot, France, portrayed with a similar pleated garment, holding two snakes in one hand, on an altar associated with aquatic cults. Ross fails to mention that this region of France is where the Lingones, a Gaulish tribe from which the Roman troops were recruited, originated. It seems possible that the Mavilly altar is a precursor of the Verbeia altar.

Some sources state, however, that the Ilkley troops were recruited from the Lingones in northeast Italy; some of the tribe migrated across the Alps in around 400 BC Lingones.

==The Swastika Stone==
The Swastika Stone is a petroglyph on the northern edge of Ilkley Moor, overlooking the Wharfe valley, which is unique in British rock art. It uses cup-marks, but is otherwise distinct from the cup-and-ring art found across the moor. It is identical in form to certain of the Camunian rose motifs found in Val Camonica, northern Italy. It seems possible that the Lingones troops who worshipped Verbeia may have encountered the Camunian rose on migrating across the Alps, and adopted the symbol, carving it on Ilkley Moor while stationed there.

Ross repeatedly associates Verbeia with the goddesses Brigid and Brigantia. Given that Brigid&#x27;s cross is a prevalent swastika-like image in Ireland, there may be further links here between Verbeia, imported Gaulish cults, and the swastika image.

==Etymology==
Proto-Celtic is reconstructed as having &quot;*werbā-&quot; &#x27;blister&#x27; in its lexicon and the name may be a suffixed form of this lexeme meaning “blistered one.” On the other hand, the root of the name may represent a Celtic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*wer-bhe-&quot; ‘bend, turn,’ cognate with Modern English &quot;warp,&quot; followed by the durative suffix *&quot;-j-&quot; and the feminine suffix *&quot;-ā-&quot; and so might have meant “she who is constantly bending and turning.” Another possibility is that the name is a compound of Romano-British reflexes of the Proto-Celtic elements *&quot;*Uφer-bej-ā-&quot; (upper-strike-F) “the upper striker.”

<text>Vosegus (; sometimes &quot;Vosagus&quot;, &quot;Vosacius&quot;, &quot;Vosagō&quot;, &quot;Vosegō&quot;, &quot;Vogesus&quot;) was a name used in the Roman Empire for a Celtic god of hunting and forestation.

== Description and history ==
On the rare representations that have come down to us, Vosegus is represented with a bow and a shield, and he is sometimes accompanied by a dog. He is also associated with a local hunting deity with a piglet under his arm, and sometimes associated with nuts, acorns, and pine cones. The central area where Vosegus was worshiped was around the Donon. On top of a hill there was a temple dedicated to Vosegus.

The name is derived from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;uɸo&quot;- (“sub-, under”) and *&quot;segos&quot; (“force, victory”).

Later in Gallo-Roman religion, Vosegus was the patron god of the Vosges in eastern Gaul. His name is attested in about five inscriptions from western Germany and eastern France, twice in the form &quot;Vosego Silv(estri)&quot; and once as &quot;Merc(urio) Vos(ego)&quot;.

<doc id="86868" wikidata="Q342862" url="?curid=86868" title="Joseph Kittinger">
<text>Joseph William Kittinger II (July 27, 1928 – December 9, 2022) was an officer in the United States Air Force (USAF) who served from 1950 to 1978, and earned Command Pilot status before retiring with the rank of colonel. He held the world record for the highest skydive—102,800 feet (31.3 km)—from 1960 until 2012.

He participated in the Project Manhigh and Project Excelsior high-altitude balloon flight projects from 1956 to 1960 and was the first man to fully witness the curvature of the Earth. 

A fighter pilot during the Vietnam War, Kittinger shot down a North Vietnamese MiG-21 jet fighter. He was later shot down as well, subsequently spending 11 months as a prisoner of war in a North Vietnamese prison before he was repatriated in 1973.

In 1984, he became the first person to make a solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in a gas balloon.

In 2012, Kittinger participated in the Red Bull Stratos project as capsule communicator at age 84, directing Felix Baumgartner on his freefall from Earth&#x27;s stratosphere, which broke Kittinger&#x27;s own 53-year-old record. Felix Baumgartner&#x27;s record would be broken two years later by Alan Eustace.

==Early life and military career==
Born in Tampa, Florida, and raised in Orlando, Florida, Kittinger was educated at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, and the University of Florida. He became fascinated with planes at a young age and soloed in a Piper Cub by the time he was 17. After racing speedboats as a teenager, he entered the U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in March 1949. On completion of aviation cadet training in March 1950, he received his pilot wings and a commission as a second lieutenant. He was subsequently assigned to the 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing based at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, flying the F-84 Thunderjet and F-86 Sabre.

In 1954, Kittinger was transferred to the Air Force Missile Development Center (AFMDC) at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It was during this assignment that he flew the observation/chase plane that monitored flight surgeon Colonel John Stapp&#x27;s rocket sled run of in 1955. Kittinger was impressed by Stapp&#x27;s dedication and leadership as a pioneer in aerospace medicine. Stapp, in turn, was impressed with Kittinger&#x27;s skillful jet piloting, later recommending him for space-related aviation research work. Stapp was to foster the high-altitude balloon tests that would later lead to Kittinger&#x27;s record-setting leap from over . In 1957, as part of &quot;Project Manhigh&quot;, Kittinger set an interim balloon altitude record of in &quot;Manhigh I&quot;, for which he was awarded his first Distinguished Flying Cross.
==Project Excelsior==

Captain Kittinger was next assigned to the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. For &quot;Project Excelsior&quot; (meaning &quot;ever upward&quot;), a name given to the project by Colonel Stapp as part of research into high-altitude bailouts, he made a series of three extreme altitude parachute jumps from an open gondola carried aloft by large helium balloons. These jumps were made in a &quot;rocking-chair&quot; position, descending on his back, rather than in the usual face-down position familiar to skydivers. This was because he was wearing a &quot;kit&quot; on his behind, and his pressure suit naturally formed a sitting shape when it was inflated, a shape appropriate for sitting in an airplane cockpit.

&quot;Excelsior I&quot;: Kittinger&#x27;s first high-altitude jump, from about on November 16, 1959, was a near-disaster when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness. The automatic parachute opener in his equipment saved his life. He went into a flat spin at a rotational velocity of about 120 rpm, the g-forces at his extremities having been calculated to be over 22 times the force of gravity, setting another record.

&quot;Excelsior II&quot;: On December 11, 1959, Kittinger jumped again from about . For this leap, he was awarded the A. Leo Stevens Parachute Medal.

&quot;Excelsior III&quot;: On August 16, 1960, Kittinger made the final high-altitude jump at . Towing a small drogue parachute for initial stabilization, he fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of before opening his parachute at . Incurring yet another equipment malfunction, the pressurization for his right glove malfunctioned during the ascent and his right hand swelled to twice its normal size, but he rode the balloon up to 102,800 feet before stepping off.
 Of the jumps from &quot;Excelsior&quot;, Kittinger said:
There&#x27;s no way you can visualize the speed. There&#x27;s nothing you can see to see how fast you&#x27;re going. You have no depth perception. If you&#x27;re in a car driving down the road and you close your eyes, you have no idea what your speed is. It&#x27;s the same thing if you&#x27;re free falling from space. There are no signposts. You know you are going very fast, but you don&#x27;t feel it. You don&#x27;t have a 614-mph wind blowing on you. I could only hear myself breathing in the helmet.

Kittinger set historical numbers for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest-duration drogue-fall (four minutes), and fastest speed by a human being through the atmosphere. These were the USAF records, but were not submitted for aerospace world records to the (FAI). Kittinger&#x27;s record for the highest ascent was broken in 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather. His records for highest parachute jump and fastest velocity stood for 52 years, until they were broken in 2012 by Felix Baumgartner.
For this series of jumps, Kittinger was profiled in &quot;Life&quot; magazine and the &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;, decorated with a second Distinguished Flying Cross, and awarded the Harmon Trophy by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Kittinger appeared as himself on the January 7, 1963 episode of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received two votes.

==Project Stargazer==
Back at Holloman Air Force Base, Kittinger took part in &quot;Project Stargazer&quot; on December 13–14, 1962. He and the astronomer William C. White took a balloon packed with scientific equipment to an altitude of about , where they spent over 18 hours and performed a number astronomical observations. After the first flight, however, the project was canceled due to the NASA&#x27;s recent ability to send astronauts into space, and launch satellites into Earth orbit.

==Later USAF career==
In 1965, after returning to the operational Air Force, Kittinger was approached by civilian amateur parachutist Nick Piantanida for assistance on Piantanida&#x27;s &quot;Strato Jump&quot; project, an effort to break the previous freefall records of both Kittinger and Soviet Air Force officer Yevgeni Andreyev. Kittinger refused to participate in the effort, believing Piantanida&#x27;s approach to the project was too reckless. Piantanida died in 1966 as the result of a mishap suffered during his &quot;Strato Jump III&quot; attempt.

Kittinger later served three combat tours of duty during the Vietnam War, flying a total of 483 combat missions. During his first two tours he flew as an aircraft commander in Douglas A-26 Invaders and modified On Mark Engineering B-26K Counter-Invaders as part of Operations Farm Gate and Big Eagle.

Following his first two Vietnam tours, he returned to the United States and soon transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. During a voluntary third tour of duty to Vietnam in 1971–72, he commanded the 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron (555 TFS), the noted &quot;Triple Nickel&quot; squadron, flying the F-4D Phantom II. During this period he was credited with shooting down a North Vietnamese MiG-21 while flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-7463, with his WSO, 1st Lieutenant Leigh Hodgdon.

Kittinger was shot down on May 11, 1972, just before the end of his third tour of duty. While flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-0230, with his weapons systems officer, 1st Lieutenant William J. Reich, Kittinger was leading a flight of Phantoms approximately northwest of Thai Nguyen, North Vietnam, when they were engaged by a flight of MiG-21 fighters. Kittinger and his wingman were chasing a MiG-21 when Kittinger&#x27;s F-4 was hit by an air-to-air missile from another MiG-21 that damaged the plane&#x27;s starboard wing and set the aircraft on fire. Kittinger and Reich ejected a few miles from Thai Nguyen and were soon captured and taken to the city of Hanoi. During the same engagement, Kittinger&#x27;s wingman, Captain S. E. Nichols, shot down the MiG-21 they had been chasing.

Kittinger and Reich spent 11 months as prisoners of war (POWs) in the Hỏa Lò Prison, the so-called &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;. Kittinger was put through rope torture soon after his arrival at the POW compound and this made a lasting impression on him. Kittinger was the senior ranking officer (SRO) among the newer prisoners of war, &quot;i.e.&quot;, those captured after 1969. In Kittinger&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Come Up and Get Me&quot; (by Kittinger and Craig Ryan), Kittinger emphasized being very serious about maintaining the military structure he considered essential to survival. Kittinger and Reich were returned to American hands during Operation Homecoming on March 28, 1973, and they continued their Air Force careers, with Kittinger having been promoted to full colonel while in captivity. Following his return, Colonel Kittinger attended and graduated from the Air War College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama and concurrently completed requirements for a bachelor&#x27;s degree via an extension center of Tulane University.

Following completion of the Air War College, Kittinger became the vice commander of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, where he again flew the F-4 Phantom II. In 1977, he transferred to Headquarters, 12th Air Force, at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1978.

Kittinger accumulated 7,679 flying hours in the U.S. Air Force, including 948 combat flying hours during three tours during the Vietnam War. In addition, he has flown over 9,100 hours in various civilian aircraft.

==Military awards and decorations==
Kittinger received the following awards and decorations during his USAF career:

===Distinguished Flying Cross citation (first award)===

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Joseph William Kittinger, Jr. (AFSN: AO-190919/FR-52808/AD-14329714), United States Air Force, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight on 2 June 1957 in performing a solo flight to an altitude of 97,000 feet in a gondola suspended from a plastic balloon. Scientific measurements made by Captain Kittinger constitute a valuable pioneering contribution to our knowledge of extreme altitude flight. Despite difficulties due to communications malfunction and a minor oxygen failure during the flight, Captain Kittinger remained emotionally stable and outstandingly effective in collecting and transmitting data, manipulating scientific instruments, taking pictures under extremely difficult conditions and relaying as much information as possible by Morse code to ground recorders. In preparation for this, he underwent many months of preparatory training during which he participated in parachute jumps, altitude chamber tests and free balloon flights. The contributions of Captain Kittinger to the first experimental flight of a human in the MAN-HIGH project reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

===Distinguished Flying Cross citation (second award)===

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Captain Joseph William Kittinger, Jr. (AFSN: AO-190919/FR-52808/AD-14329714), United States Air Force, for extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight on 16 August 1960 near Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. On that date, Captain Kittinger made an open gondola balloon ascent to an altitude of 102,800 feet, surpassing all previous records. From this record altitude, Captain Kittinger successfully tested an experimental stabilization parachute system, free-falling for four minutes and thirty-eight seconds to an altitude of 17,500 feet where deployment of the recovery parachute occurred. By this historic achievement of national and international significance, Captain Kittinger has made a vital contribution to the advancement of aeronautical science. The personal courage, outstanding airmanship and selfless devotion to duty of Captain Kittinger reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Colonel Joseph William Kittinger, Jr. (AFSN: AO-190919/FR-52808/AD-14329714), United States Air Force, was held as a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam from May 11, 1972 until his release on March 28, 1973.
==Later civilian career==
Kittinger retired from the Air Force as a colonel in 1978 and initially went to work for Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) Corporation in Orlando, Florida. He later became vice president of flight operations for Rosie O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Flying Circus, part of the Rosie O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s/Church Street Station entertainment complex in Orlando, prior to the parent company&#x27;s dissolution.

Still interested in ballooning, Kittinger set a world distance record for the AA-06 size class of gas balloons of in 1983. The record has since been broken. In 1984, he completed the first solo balloon crossing of the Atlantic in the &quot;Balloon of Peace&quot;, launched from Caribou, Maine, on September 14 and landing on September 18. The flight was organized by the Canadian promoter Gaetan Croteau. An official FAI world aerospace record, the flight is the longest gas balloon flight in the AA-10 size category. For the second time in his life, he was the subject of a story in National Geographic Magazine.

Kittinger participated in the Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning in 1989 (ranked third) and 1994 (ranked 12th).

In the early 1990s, Kittinger helped NASA plan Charles &quot;Nish&quot; Bruce&#x27;s project to break Kittinger&#x27;s highest parachute jump record. The project was suspended in 1994.

Joining the Red Bull Stratos project, Kittinger advised Felix Baumgartner on Baumgartner&#x27;s October 14, 2012, free-fall from . The project collected leading experts in the fields of aeronautics, medicine, and engineering to ensure its success. Kittinger served as CAPCOM (capsule communicator) for Baumgartner&#x27;s jump, which broke Kittinger&#x27;s altitude record set during Project Excelsior.

In 2013, Kittinger helped balloonist Jonathan Trappe as he attempted to be the first to cross the Atlantic by cluster balloon.

==Legacy==
In 1997, Kittinger was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

On January 23, 2007, the Civil Air Patrol honored Kittinger by renaming the Texas CAP wing&#x27;s TX-352 Squadron after him. Texas Governor Rick Perry cited Kittinger&#x27;s work, as did the Texas state senate with a special resolution presented during the dedication ceremony attended by Kittinger and his wife, Sherry. The Colonel Joseph W. Kittinger Phantom Senior Squadron of CAP&#x27;s Texas Wing is based at the former Bergstrom AFB, the site of Kittinger&#x27;s last active duty assignment in the Air Force and which is now the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

Kittinger was honored at a 2009 ceremony in Caribou, Maine, the launch point for his 1984 solo trans-Atlantic balloon flight. He also served as the guest of honor at the community&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebration.

On February 20, 2013, Kittinger visited his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the University of Florida, and spoke to over 400 students and faculty about his role in the Red Bull Stratos and &quot;Excelsior III&quot;. The event took place during the UF Engineers Week, and it was made possible due to the efforts of the UF American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UF&#x27;s Air Force ROTC Detachment 150, and the UF College of Engineering.

In November 2023, Kittinger was posthumously inducted into the Florida Veterans Hall of Fame in Tallahassee, Florida.

===Colonel Joe Kittinger Park===

In September 1992, Colonel Joe Kittinger Park in Orlando, Florida, was completed by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) for the City of Orlando. Located on the southwest corner of the Orlando Executive Airport, at the corner of Crystal Lake Drive and South Street, the park was named in Kittinger&#x27;s honor, but was temporarily closed and partially demolished circa 2008–2011 in order to create a stormwater runoff retention area to permit a highway expansion project of the State Road 408 East-West Expressway. In March 2011, the park was reopened at its previous location.

In spring 2014, the mayor of Orange County, the mayor of Orlando, the GOAA Board, and other City of Orlando and GOAA officials approved the installation in the park of a restored USAF F-4 Phantom II aircraft. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force picked an F-4D previously on display in Corsicana, Texas (Air Force serial no. 65-0747) to be moved to Orlando for display. It was subsequently determined that Kittinger had flown this particular F-4D on several occasions when it was assigned to his fighter wing in Thailand during the Vietnam War, and later when it was assigned to his fighter wing in Great Britain. Disassembled in Texas and transported in two semi-trailers over several days, the aircraft arrived in Orlando on July 22, 2014. It was restored by a team of volunteers at Orlando Executive Airport and painted with the colors and markings of the squadron that Kittinger commanded during the Vietnam War. The restored aircraft was mounted on its pylon and formally dedicated on December 14, 2014.

==Personal life and death==
Kittinger died at the age of 94 on December 9, 2022, from lung cancer, survived by his wife, two sons, four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Marne () is a department in the Grand Est region of France. It is named after the river Marne which flows through it. The prefecture (capital) of Marne is Châlons-en-Champagne (formerly known as Châlons-sur-Marne). The subprefectures are Épernay, Reims, and Vitry-le-François. It had a population of 566,855 in 2019.

The Champagne vineyards producing the eponymous sparkling wine are in Marne.

==Name==
The department is named after the Marne, which was called &quot;Matrona&quot; in Roman times.

==History==
Marne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. It was created from the province of Champagne.

Marne has a long association with the French Army. The training ground of the &quot;Camp Militaire de Mailly&quot; straddles the border with the département of Aube in the south while that of the &quot;Camp de Mourmelon&quot; occupies a large area north of Châlons-en-Champagne. The smaller &quot;Camp de Moronvilliers&quot; lies to the east of Reims and the &quot;Camp Militaire de Suippes&quot; lies to the east of that. These are all located on the chalk grounds of the Champagne plateau, a feature comparable in geology but not size, with the British military training ground on Salisbury Plain.

The Battles of the Marne, where the British and French fought against Germany during World War I, took place here.

==Geography==
Marne is part of the region of Grand Est and is surrounded by the departments of Ardennes, Meuse, Haute-Marne, Aube, Seine-et-Marne, and Aisne.

Geologically, it divides into two distinct parts; the Upper Cretaceous chalk plain in the east and the more wooded and hilly Eocene and Oligocene in the west.

Rivers draining the department include the Marne, Vesle, Ardre and Somme-Soude. Numerous other rivers, such as the Grande and the Petite Morin rise in the department but flow mainly in others. Conversely, the Aube joins the Seine in the department of Marne.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune in the department is Reims; the prefecture Châlons-en-Champagne is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are five communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Marnais&quot;.

Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Christian Bruyen, elected in 2017.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Tourism==
Reims, with its cathedral in which the kings of France were traditionally crowned, is a major attraction. Others include the bird reserve on the Lake Der-Chantecoq and the fishing lakes nearby. The &quot;Parc Naturel Régional de la Montagne de Reims&quot; is a major area of country recreation. In the west of the département there are many scenic routes as also are the several wine cellars of Épernay.

<text>Bitterroot (&quot;Lewisia rediviva&quot;) is a small perennial herb in the family Montiaceae. Its specific epithet (&quot;revived, reborn&quot;) refers to its ability to regenerate from dry and seemingly dead roots.

The genus &quot;Lewisia&quot; was moved in 2009 from the purslane family (Portulacaceae) with adoption of the APG III system, to the family Montiaceae.

==Description==
&quot;Lewisia rediviva&quot; is a low-growing perennial plant with a fleshy taproot and a simple or branched base and a low rosette of thick fleshy linear leaves with blunt tips. The leaves are roughly circular in cross section, sometimes somewhat flattened on the adaxial (top) surface. The absence of an adaxial groove on the leaves distinguishes this from other &quot;Lewisia&quot; species with overlapping ranges. The leaves often wither before flowers open.

The very short flower stems are leafless, tall, bearing at the tip a whorl of 5–6 linear bracts which are 5–10 mm long. A single proportionally huge flower appears on each stem with 5–9 oval-shaped sepals and many petals. The petals (usually about 15) are oblong in shape and are long. They range in color from whitish to deep pink or lavender. Flowering occurs from April through July. At maturity, the bitterroot produces egg-shaped capsules with 6–20 nearly round seeds.

==Distribution==
The plant is native to western North America from low to moderate elevations on grassland, open bushland, forest in dry rocky or gravelly soils. Its range extends from southern British Columbia, through Washington and Oregon west of the Cascade Range to southern California, and east to western Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, northern Colorado and northern Arizona.

==Uses==
The thick roots come into season in spring and can survive extremely dry conditions. If collected early enough in the season, they can be peeled, boiled, and made into a jelly-like food.

==History and culture==

French trappers knew the plant as (bitter root). Native American names include &quot;spetlum/sp̓eƛ̓m̓&quot; or &quot;spetlem&quot; (&quot;hand-peeled&quot;), &quot;nakamtcu&quot; (Ktanxa: &quot;naqam¢u&quot;), and &quot;mo&#x27;ôtáa-heséeo&#x27;ôtse&quot; (Cheyenne, &quot;black medicine&quot;).

The roots were consumed by tribes such as the Shoshone and the Flathead Indians as an infrequent delicacy. Traditionally, the Ktunaxa cooked bitterroot with grouse. For the Ktunaxa, bitterroot is eaten with sugar; other tribes prefer eating it with salt. The Lemhi Shoshone believed the small red core found in the upper taproot had special powers, notably being able to stop a bear attack. Plains Indians peeled and boiled the root prior to its consumption.


Meriwether Lewis ate bitterroot in 1805 and 1806 during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The specimens he brought back were identified and given their scientific name, &quot;Lewisia rediviva&quot;, by a German-American botanist, Frederick Pursh.
Based on Lewis and Clark&#x27;s manuscript, Pursh labeled it &quot;spatlum&quot;; this apparently was actually a Salishan name for &quot;tobacco&quot;.

The bitterroot was selected as the Montana state flower in 1895.

Three major geographic features – the Bitterroot Mountains (running north–south and forming the divide between Idaho and Montana), the Bitterroot Valley, and the Bitterroot River (which flows south–north, terminating in the Clark Fork river in the city of Missoula) – owe the origins of their names to this flower.

<doc id="86884" wikidata="Q901769" url="?curid=86884" title="Synod of Dort">
<text>The Synod of Dort (also known as the Synod of Dordt or the Synod of Dordrecht) was a European transnational Synod held in Dordrecht in 1618–1619, by the Dutch Reformed Church, to settle a divisive controversy caused by the rise of Arminianism. The first meeting was on 13 November 1618 and the final meeting, the 154th, was on 9 May 1619. Voting representatives from eight foreign Reformed churches were also invited. &quot;Dort&quot; was a contemporary Dutch term for the town of &quot;Dordrecht&quot; (and it remains the local colloquial pronunciation).

In 2014, the first entire critical edition of the Acts and Documents of the Synod was published.

==Background==

There had been previous provincial synods of Dort, and a National Synod in 1578. For that reason the 1618 meeting is sometimes called the &quot;Second Synod of Dort&quot;.

The acts of the Synod were tied to political intrigues that arose during the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, a pause in the Dutch war with Spain. After the death of Jacobus Arminius his followers presented objections to the Belgic Confession and the teaching of John Calvin, Theodore Beza, and their followers. These objections were published in a document called The Remonstrance of 1610, and the Arminians were therefore also known as &quot;Remonstrants&quot;. They taught conditional election on the basis of foreseen faith, unlimited atonement, resistible grace, and the possibility of lapse from grace. The opposing Calvinists or Gomarists, led by Franciscus Gomarus of the University of Leiden, became known as the &quot;Contra-Remonstrants&quot;.

The Arminians were accused of propagating false doctrine and perceived as ready to compromise with the Spanish, whereas the Dutch Calvinists were not, so Arminianism was considered by some to be not only theologically unsound but also political treason; in 1617–1618 there was a pamphlet war and Francis van Aarssens expressed the view that the Arminians were working for Philip IV of Spain. Planning for a National Synod was begun by Adriaan Pauw in March 1618. Before that, there had been a debate as to whether the synod should be national, as the Contra-Remonstrants wished, or provincial for Holland, as the Remonstrants argued. This decision was worked out in 1617, with outside input from the English ambassador Dudley Carleton.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Synod was to settle the controversy over Arminianism. It was subsequently alleged, but never proven, that the outcome had already been decided. According to Frederick Calder, &quot;condemnation [of the Remonstrant doctrines] was determined before the national synod met.&quot; On the other hand, beyond the condemnation of the Arminians, the theological formulations of the Canons of the Synod by no means gave support to all the Gomarists wanted. In fact, Johannes Bogerman, president of the synod, himself a Supralapsarian, argued for the inclusion of the Infralapsarian position in the Canons. The more extreme views of Dutch Calvinists were moderated in the detailed debates.

== Delegates ==

The Synod had 27 members representing Reformed groups from continental Europe, as well as from the British Isles. Among these groups were also Anglican delegates from the Church of England and the Church of Scotland.

==Proceedings==
Simon Episcopius (1583–1643) was spokesman of the 14 Remonstrants who were summoned before the Synod in 1618. At the opening of the synod, Episcopius asked to speak.

Episcopius ... insisted on being permitted to begin with a refutation of the Calvinistic doctrines, especially that of reprobation, hoping that, by placing his objections to this doctrine in front of all the rest, he might excite such prejudice against the other articles of the system, as to secure the popular voice in his favor. The Synod, however, very properly, reminded him ... that, as the Remonstrants were accused of departing from the Reformed faith, they were bound first to justify themselves, by giving Scriptural proof in support of their opinions. The Arminians would not submit to this plan of procedure because it destroyed their whole scheme of argument ... and were thus compelled to withdraw. Upon their departure, the Synod proceeded without them.

He concluded by expressing his dissatisfaction with the organization of the assembly, and that the Contra-Remonstrants had prevented an accurate representation of the Arminian supporters in the Dutch Reformed Church with votes in the synod. A delegation of Episcopius consisting of Bernard Arentsz Dwinglo (1582–1652) and Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus called on the Church of England representatives, and others coming from outside, asking for support and giving written accounts of the context. After that a month was spent on procedural matters concerning the Remonstrants. They were finally ejected from the Synod at session 57 on 14 January.

==The Canons of Dort==

The Synod concluded with a rejection of the Arminian views, and set forth the Reformed doctrine on each point, namely: total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement (arguing that Christ&#x27;s atoning work was intended only for the elect and not for the rest of the world), irresistible (or irrevocable) grace, and the perseverance of the saints. These are sometimes referred to as the Five points of Calvinism. The nomenclature did not imply that all of Calvinism could be reduced to a mere five points, but that TULIP—the acronym that was later developed for the teachings of Dort in the English-speaking world—summarized the Calvinist position regarding the doctrine of the Sovereignty of God in salvation. &quot;The Decision of the Synod of Dort on the Five Main Points of Doctrine in Dispute in the Netherlands&quot;, popularly known as the Canons of Dort, is the explanation of the judicial decision of the Synod. In the original preface, the &quot;Decision&quot; is called:
a judgment, in which both, the true view agreeing with God&#x27;s word concerning the aforesaid five points of doctrine is explained and, the false view disagreeing with God&#x27;s Word is rejected.

==Aftermath==
The thirteen Remonstrant ministers, including Episcopius, had been charged to remain in Dort until further instruction. On 20 May 1619 the Remonstrant ministers who had been present were summoned by the lay-commissioners of the synod and directed to abstain from ministerial activities such as preaching, exhorting, administering the sacraments, and visiting the sick. Furthermore, Episcopius was commanded not to write letters or books promoting the doctrines of the Remonstrants. The Remonstrants agreed to refrain from ministering in the government-ordained churches, but confessed their duty to expound their doctrines wherever people would assemble to hear them.

On 5 July they were called to the States-General assembly where they were requested to sign &quot;The Act of Cessation&quot;, the legalization of the order to desist from the ministry. When they refused to sign it, they were sentenced as &quot;disturbers of the public peace&quot; and ordered to leave the United Provinces. However, in the 18th century, Arminian theology spread to England where it became integral to the theology of the Methodist churches.

== Bible translation==

The synod also initiated an official Dutch Bible translation (the &quot;Statenvertaling&quot;, i.e. &quot;Translation of the States&quot; or, the &quot;Dutch Authorized Version&quot;) from the original languages that would be completed in 1637. Translators were appointed, and the States-General were asked to fund the project. It had a lasting impact on the standard Dutch language, which was just then beginning to gain wider acceptance and developing a literary tradition. It would remain the standard translation in Protestant churches for more than three centuries and still is used in some sister churches of the Netherlands Reformed Congregations and similar, smaller denominations.

Like its sister translations, the Genevan Bible and the King James Version (Authorized Version), the Dutch pastor-scholars worked in the Old Testament from the Masoretic Text (consulting the Septuagint) and in the New Testament from the Textus Receptus (consulting the Majority Text).

In 1645, the Westminster Assembly appointed Theodore Haak to translate the &quot;Statenvertaling met kanttekeningen&quot; (&quot;The Dort Bible and its Commentary&quot;) into English for wider distribution. This work was published by Henry Hill in London 1657.

== Political impact==
The Synod rejected the teachings of the Remonstrants on the controverted points as falling outside the bounds of the Reformed confessions. There followed the political condemnation of the statesman Johan van Oldenbarnevelt who had been the protector of the Remonstrants. For the crime of &quot;general perturbation in the state of the nation, both in Church and State&quot; (treason), he was beheaded on 13 May 1619, only four days after the final meeting of the Synod. As consequence of the Arminian defeat, the jurist Hugo Grotius was given a life sentence in prison; but he escaped with the help of his wife. Both Van Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius had in fact been imprisoned since 29 August 1618.

<text>Tiny BASIC is a family of dialects of the BASIC programming language that can fit into 4 or fewer KBs of memory. Tiny BASIC was designed by Dennis Allison and the People&#x27;s Computer Company (PCC) in response to the open letter published by Bill Gates complaining about users pirating Altair BASIC, which sold for $150. Tiny BASIC was intended to be a completely free version of BASIC that would run on the same early microcomputers.

Tiny BASIC was released as a specification, not an implementation, published in the September 1975 issue of the PCC newsletter. The article invited programmers to implement it on their machines and send the resulting assembler language implementation back for inclusion in a series of three planned newsletters. Li-Chen Wang, author of Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, coined the term &quot;copyleft&quot; to describe this concept. The community response was so overwhelming that the newsletter was relaunched as &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the first regular periodical to focus on microcomputer software. &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; lasted in print form for 34 years and then online until 2014, when its website became a static archive.

The small size and free source code made these implementations invaluable in the early days of microcomputers in the mid-1970s, when RAM was expensive and typical memory size was only 4 to 8 KB. While the minimal version of Microsoft&#x27;s Altair BASIC would also run in 4 KB machines, it left only 790 bytes free for BASIC programs. More free space was a significant advantage of Tiny BASIC. To meet these strict size limits, Tiny BASIC dialects generally lacked a variety of features commonly found in other dialects, for instance, most versions lacked string variables, lacked floating-point math, and allowed only single-letter variable names.

Tiny BASIC implementations are still used today, for programming microcontrollers such as the Arduino.

==History==
=== Altair BASIC ===
The earliest microcomputers, like the MITS Altair 8800, generally had no built-in input/output (I/O) beyond front-panel switches and LED lamps. Useful work generally required the addition of an I/O expansion card and the use of some form of terminal. At the time, video-based terminals were very expensive, costing much more than the computer, so many users turned to mechanical devices like the Teletype Model 33. The Model 33, like most teleprinters of the era, included a tape punch system intended to allow operators to pre-record their messages and then play them at &quot;high speed&quot;, faster than most individuals could type the message live. For the early microcomputers, this provided a convenient computer data storage format, allowing the users to write programs to paper tape and distribute them to other users.

The Homebrew Computer Club met for the first time in March 1975, and its members soon used the meetings to swap software on punched tape. At the June meeting, a tape containing a pre-release version of Altair BASIC disappeared. The tape was given to Steve Dompier, who passed it on to Dan Sokol, who had access to a high-speed tape punch. At the next meeting, 50 copies of Altair BASIC on paper tape appeared in a cardboard box. When Ed Roberts, founder of MITS, learned of this, he stated &quot;Anyone who is using a stolen copy of MITS BASIC should identify himself for what he is, a thief.&quot; Bill Gates made this more formal, writing &quot;An Open Letter to Hobbyists&quot;, complaining that &quot;As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.&quot;

===Tiny BASIC===
The complaint was not well received. Among the many responses, Bob Albrecht, another Homebrew member and founder of the People&#x27;s Computer Company (PCC), felt the best response would be to produce their own BASIC that was completely free to use by anyone. He approached Dennis Allison, a member of the Computer Science faculty at Stanford University, to write a specification for a version of BASIC that would fit in 2 to 3 kilobytes of memory. To aid porting, the design was based on an intermediate language (IL), an interpreter for the interpreter, which meant only a small portion of the total code had to be ported.

Allison&#x27;s initial design was published in the September 1975 edition of the PCC newsletter, along with an Intel 8080 version of the IL interpreter. The article called on programmers to implement the design on their computer and send the resulting assembly language version back to the PCC. They stated their plans to publish three special newsletters containing these user-submitted versions, along with bug fixes, programs written in the new BASIC, and suggestions and enhancements. The concept gained further notice when it was republished in the January 1976 edition of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages. Submissions poured in. Among the notable early versions was Tiny BASIC Extended by Dick Whipple and John Arnold which ran in 3K of RAM, added FOR...NXT loops, and allowed a single numeric array. They avoided the use of the IL and wrote it directly in machine code, using octal.

The first of the three planned newsletters, with the title &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal of Computer Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia, Running Light Without Overbyte&quot;, was published in January 1976. It starts with a note from Albrecht, under the penname &quot;the dragon&quot;, suggesting that three editions would not be enough, and asked the readers if they would like to see it continue. It also reprinted the original article on Tiny BASIC from PCC, included the complete listing of Extended TB, and included a number of small BASIC programs including tips-and-tricks from Allison. Response to the first issue was so impressive that the introduction to the second issue stated they had already decided to continue publishing the new newsletter under the simplified name &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Over the next several issues, additional versions of the language were published, and similar articles began appearing in other magazines like &quot;Interface Age&quot;.

===Spread===
By the middle of 1976, Tiny BASIC interpreters were available for the Intel 8080, the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502 processors. This was a forerunner of the free software community&#x27;s collaborative development before the internet allowed easy transfer of files, and was an example of a free software project before the free software movement. Computer hobbyists would exchange paper tapes, cassettes or even retype the files from the printed listings.

Jim Warren, editor of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot;, wrote in the July 1976 ACM &quot;Programming Language&quot; newsletter about the motivations and methods of this successful project. He started with this: &quot;There is a viable alternative to the problems raised by Bill Gates in his irate letter to computer hobbyists concerning &#x27;ripping off&#x27; software. When software is free, or so inexpensive that it&#x27;s easier to pay for it than to duplicate it, then it won&#x27;t be &#x27;stolen&#x27;.&quot; The Bill Gates letter was written to make software into products. The alternative method was to have an experienced professional do the overall design and then outline an implementation strategy. Knowledgeable amateurs would implement the design for a variety of computer systems. Warren predicted this strategy would be continued and expanded.

The May 1976 issue of &quot;Dr. Dobbs&quot; has Li-Chen Wang&#x27;s Palo Alto Tiny BASIC for the 8080. The listing begins with the title, author&#x27;s name, and date but it also has &quot;@COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED&quot;. A fellow Homebrew Computer Club member, Roger Rauskolb, modified and improved Wang&#x27;s program and this was published in the December 1976 issue of &quot;Interface Age&quot; magazine. Roger added his name and preserved the COPYLEFT Notice.

==Description==
===Basic concepts===
Tiny BASIC was designed to use as little memory as possible, and this is reflected in the paucity of features as well as details of its interpreter system. Early microcomputers lacked the RAM and secondary storage for a BASIC compiler, which was more typical of timesharing systems.

Like most BASICs of the era, Tiny Basic was interactive with the user typing statements into a command line. As microcomputers of the era were often used with teletype machines or &quot;dumb&quot; terminals, direct editing of existing text was not possible and the editor instead used takeout characters, often the backslash, to indicate where the user backed up to edit existing text.

If the user typed a statement into the command line the system examined it to see if it started with a number. If it did not, the line was immediately parsed and operated on, potentially generating output via . This was known as &quot;direct mode&quot;.

If the line was entered with a leading number, the number was converted from decimal format, like &quot;50&quot;, and converted to a 8-bit value, in this case, hexadecimal. This number was used as an index into an array-like storage area where the rest of the line was stored in exactly the format it was typed. When the user typed into the command line the system would loop over the array, convert the line number back to decimal format, and then print out the rest of the text in the line.

When a program was present in memory and the user types in the command, the system enters &quot;indirect mode&quot;. In this mode, a pointer is set to point to the first line of the program, for instance, 10 (). The original text for that line is then retrieved from the store and run as if the user had just typed it in direct mode. The pointer then advances to the next line and the process continues.

===Formal grammar===
The grammar is listed below in Backus–Naur form, almost exactly as it was specified in the Design Note. In the listing, an asterisk (&quot;codice_1&quot;) denotes zero or more of the object to its left except for the first asterisk in the definition of &quot;codice_2&quot;, which is the multiplication operator; parentheses group objects; and an epsilon (&quot;codice_3&quot;) signifies the empty string. As is common in computer language grammar notation, the vertical bar (&quot;codice_4&quot;) distinguishes alternatives, as does their being listed on separate lines. The symbol &quot;codice_5&quot; denotes a carriage return (usually generated by a keyboard&#x27;s &quot;Enter&quot; key). A BREAK from the console will interrupt execution of the program.
 line ::= number statement CR | statement CR
 statement ::= PRINT expr-list
 IF expression relop expression THEN statement
 GOTO expression
 INPUT var-list
 LET var = expression
 GOSUB expression
 RETURN
 CLEAR
 LIST
 RUN
 END
 expr-list ::= (string|expression) (, (string|expression) )*
 var-list ::= var (, var)*
 expression ::= (+|-|ε) term ((+|-) term)*
 term ::= factor ((*|/) factor)*
 factor ::= var | number | (expression)
 var ::= A | B | C ... | Y | Z
 number ::= digit digit*
 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | 8 | 9
 relop ::= &lt; (&gt;|=|ε) | &gt; (&lt;|=|ε) | =

 string ::= &quot; ( |!|#|$ ... -|.|/|digit|: ... @|A|B|C ... |X|Y|Z)* &quot;
Note that string wasn&#x27;t defined in the Design Note.

This syntax, as simple as it was, added one innovation: and could take an expression rather than just a line number, providing an assigned GOTO rather than the switch statement of the , a structure then supported in HP Time-Shared BASIC and predating . The syntax allowing (as opposed to just a line number to branch to) was not yet supported in Dartmouth BASIC at this time but had been introduced by Digital and copied by Microsoft.

===Implementation in a virtual machine===
The Design Note specified a virtual machine, in which the Tiny BASIC interpreter is itself run on a virtual machine interpreter. The designer&#x27;s idea to use an application virtual machine goes back to Val Schorre (with META II, 1964) and Glennie (Syntax Machine). The choice of a virtual machine approach economized on memory space and implementation effort, although the BASIC programs run thereon were executed somewhat slowly.

Dialects that used the virtual machine included Tiny BASIC Extended, Tom Pittman&#x27;s Tiny BASIC and NIBL. Other dialects such as Denver Tiny BASIC (DTB) and Palo Alto Tiny BASIC were direct interpreters. Some programmers, such as Fred Greeb with DTB, treated the IL (Interpretive Language) program as pseudocode for the algorithm to implement in assembly language; Denver Tiny BASIC did not use a virtual machine, but it did closely follow the IL program.

This is a representative excerpt from the 120-line IL program:

S1: TST S3,&#x27;GO&#x27; ;GOTO OR GOSUB?
 TST S2,&#x27;TO&#x27; ;YES...TO, OR...SUB
 CALL EXPR ;GET LABEL
 DONE ;ERROR IF CR NOT NEXT
 XFER ;SET UP AND JUMP
S3: TST S8,&#x27;PRINT&#x27; ;PRINT.
A common pattern in the program is to test for a keyword or part of a keyword, then act on that information. Each test is an assertion as to what is next in the line buffer. If the assertion fails, control jumps to a subsequent label (usually looking for a new keyword or token). Here the system advances its buffer cursor over any spaces and tests for and if it fails to find it then jumps to line . If it finds it, execution continues with the next IL command. In this case, the system next tests for , skipping to line if it fails (a test for , to see if this is instead a command). If it passes, control continues; in this case, calling an IL subroutine that starts at label , which parses an expression. In Tiny BASIC, (a computed GO TO) is as legal as and is the alternative to the ON-GOTO of larger BASIC implementations. The subroutine pushes the result of the expression onto the arithmetic stack (in this case, the line number). verifies no other text follows the expression and gives an error if it does. pops the number from the stack and transfers execution (GOes TO) the corresponding line number, if it exists.

The following table gives a partial list of the 32 commands of the virtual machine in which the first Tiny BASIC interpreter was written. 
: If &quot;string&quot; matches the BASIC line, advance cursor over and execute the next IL instruction; if the test fails, execute the IL instruction at the label &quot;lbl&quot;
; : Execute the IL subroutine starting at ; save the IL address following the CALL on the control stack
; : Report a syntax error if after deleting leading blanks the cursor is not positioned to reach a carriage return
; : Test value at the top of the AE stack to be within range. If not, report an error. If so, attempt to position cursor at that line. If it exists, begin interpretation there; if not, report an error. 
; : Continue execution of the IL at the label specified
; : Return to the IL location specified at the top of the control stack
; : Print characters from the BASIC text up to but not including the closing quotation mark
; : Print number obtained by popping the top of the expression stack
; : Insert spaces to move the print head to next zone
; : Output a CRLF to the printer

Tom Pittman, discussing the IL, says: &quot;The TINY BASIC interpreter was designed by Dennis Allison as a recursive descent parser. Some of the elegant simplicity of this design was lost in the addition of syntactical sugar to the language but the basic form remains. The IL is especially suited to Recursive Descent parsing of TINY BASIC because of the general recursive nature of its procedures and the simplicity of the TINY BASIC tokens. The IL language is effectively optimized for the interpretation of TINY. Experience has shown that the difficulty of adding new features to the language is all out of proportion with the nature of the features. Usually it is necessary to add additional machine language subroutines to support the new features. Often the difficulty outweighs the advantages.&quot;

===Deviations from the design===
Defining Tiny BASIC for the Homebrew Computer Club, Pittman wrote, &quot;Tiny BASIC is a proper subset of Dartmouth BASIC, consisting of the following statement types only: LET, PRINT, INPUT, IF, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, END, CLEAR, LIST, RUN. Arithmetic is in 16-bit integers only with the operators + - * / and nested parentheses. There are only the 26 single letter variable names A, B, ...Z, and no functions. There are no strings or arrays... Tiny BASIC specifies line numbers less than 256.&quot; He then went on to describe his implementation: &quot;This language has been augmented to include the functions RND, USR, and PEEK and POKE, giving the user access to all his system components in the 6800 from the BASIC program.&quot;

Many implementers brought their own experiences with HP Time-Shared BASIC or DEC BASIC-PLUS to their designs and relaxed the formal Tiny BASIC language specification. Of the seven prominent implementations published by 1977:
* All added some sort of random number function, typically . Though not included in the specification, a newsletter article prior to the Design Note for Tiny BASIC requested only this function.
* All enabled to be optional and most let expressions in assignment statements contain relational operators.
* All but 6800TB supported statement delimiters in lines, typically although TBX used and PATB used .
* In statements, all but MINOL removed the need for expressions to contain relational operators (e.g., was valid). Implementations removed altogether or made it optional or supported it only for implied . None supported clauses.
* Many modified to support print zones, using to go to the next zone and to not advance the cursor.
* All but 6800TB and DTB added .
* All but 6800TB and MINOL added a function to return memory size: TBX had , DTB and PATB had , L1B had , and NIBL had .
* Four implementations added arrays, whether a single, undimensioned array in PATB and L1B or ensionable arrays in TBX and DTB.
* Four implementations added the ark statement.
* Four implementations added the loop: PATB, NIBL, and L1B offered , while TBX did not support and used the keyword to end a loop.
* Only NIBL had any nod towards structured programming, with , despite Allison&#x27;s lament in Issue 2 about problems with BASIC.

As an alternative to tokenization, to save RAM, TBX, DTB, and MINOL truncated keywords: for , for , for . The full, traditional keywords were not accepted. In contrast, PATB allowed accepted traditional keywords but also allowed any keyword to be abbreviated to its minimal unique string, with a trailing period. For instance, could be typed , although and other variations also worked. This system was retained in Level I BASIC for the TRS-80, which used PATB, and was also later found in Atari BASIC and the BASIC of various Sharp Pocket Computers.

==Dialects==
The most prominent dialects of Tiny BASIC were the original Design Note, Tiny BASIC Extended, Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, and 6800 Tiny BASIC. However, many other versions of Tiny BASIC existed.

===List of prominent dialects===
Tiny BASIC was first published in a newsletter offshoot of the People&#x27;s Computer Company, a newsletter which became &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a long-lived computing magazine. About ten versions were published in the magazine.

TBX was also known as Texas Tiny BASIC.

Both SCELBAL and 6800 Tiny BASIC were announced in the magazine but did not publish their source code.

===Palo Alto Tiny BASIC===

One of the most popular of the many versions of Tiny BASIC was Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, or PATB for short, by Li-Chen Wang. PATB first appeared in the May 1976 edition of &quot;Dr. Dobbs&quot;, written in a custom assembly language with non-standard mnemonics. This led to further ports that worked with conventional assemblers on the 8080. The first version of the interpreter occupied 1.77 kilobytes of memory and assumed the use of a Teletype Machine (TTY) for user input/output. An erratum to the original article appeared in the June/July issue of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s&quot; (Vol. 1, No 6). This article also included information on adding additional I/O devices, using code for the &quot;VDM&quot; video display by Processor Technology as an example.

Wang was one of the first to use the word &quot;copyleft&quot;.
In Palo Alto Tiny BASIC&#x27;s distribution notice, he had written &quot;@COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED&quot;. Tiny BASIC was not distributed under any formal form of copyleft distribution terms, but was presented in a context where source code was being shared and modified. In fact, Wang had earlier contributed edits to Tiny BASIC Extended before writing his own interpreter. He encouraged others to adapt his source code and publish their adaptions, as with Roger Rauskolb&#x27;s version of PATB published in &quot;Interface Age&quot;. He also published a third version in &quot;PCC&#x27;s Reference Book of Personal and Home Computing&quot;.

One of the most notable changes in PATB is the addition of the FOR...NEXT loop. In the original TB, loops could only be implemented using and . As in Microsoft BASIC, the upper and lower bounds of the loop were set on loop entry, and did not change during the loop, so if one of the bounds was based on a variable expression; changing the variable did not change the bound. The modifier was optional, as in MS.

Another significant change was the ability to place several statements on a single line. For reasons not explained, PATB used the semicolon to separate statements, rather than the already common colon .

Other changes include the addition of a single numeric array, with the variable name , in addition to , and the use of for not-equals in comparisons, as opposed to .

PATB used words for error messages instead of numbers. To reduce the amount of memory required, there were only three messages and they consisted of single words. The system would respond with for syntax errors, for run-time errors like GOTOs to a line that didn&#x27;t exist or numeric overflows, and for out-of-memory problems.

Wang also wrote a &quot;STARTREK&quot; program in his Tiny BASIC that appeared in the July 1976 issue of the &quot;People&#x27;s Computer Company Newsletter&quot;.

He later adapted the language into 3K Control Basic for Cromemco, adding variable names of the form letter-digit (e.g., codice_6 to codice_7), logic functions (codice_8, codice_9, codice_10), a codice_11 command to execute machine language routines, more codice_12-formatting options, and others (codice_13 and codice_14 instead of codice_15 and codice_16; I/O port functions).

Palo Alto Tiny BASIC was adapted for many other implementations, including Level I BASIC (1977), BASIC for the Sharp PC-1211 pocket computer (1980), and Astro BASIC (1982, by Jamie Fenton).

=== MINOL ===
Written by a junior in high school, MINOL was the only implementation that didn&#x27;t support the full Design Note, lacking operator precedence, having only three relational operators (&lt;, =, #), omitting and .
It only supported unsigned 8-bit precision (in contrast to signed 16-bit precision for every other implementation) and line numbers from 0 to 254.

No spaces were permitted except in strings; returns a random number, before an expression loads a string at that address; returns to operating system. Memory was addressable as if it were a two-dimensioned array of high and low bytes (e.g., &quot;(0,0)&quot; to &quot;(255,255)&quot;); executes a machine language subroutine.

===Miscellaneous dialects===
Many dialects appeared in various other publications.
Inspired by PCC&#x27;s call for Tiny BASICs, Robert Uiterwyk wrote MICRO BASIC 1.3 for the SWTPC 6800 system), which SWTPC published in the June 1976 issue of the SWTPC newsletter. Uiterwyk had handwritten the language on a legal tablet. He later expanded the language to 4K, adding support for floating point; this implementation was unique among BASIC interpreters by using Binary Coded Decimal to 9 digits of precision, with a range up to 1099, and by being published for free as a &quot;Floppy ROM&quot; magazine insert. An 8K version added string variables and trigonometry functions. Both the 4K and 8K versions were sold by SWTPC. In January, 1978, Uiterwyk sold the rights of the source code to Motorola.

Thomas F. Waitman wrote a Tiny BASIC in 1976 for the Hewlett-Packard HP-2640 and HP-2645 terminals (which used the Intel 8008 and 8080 processors), which was published in the &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;.

Published in the December 1976 issue of &quot;Interface Age&quot; was LLL (Lawrence Livermore Laboratory) BASIC, the first draft of which was developed by Steve Leininger from Allison&#x27;s specification before Leininger left National Semiconductor for Tandy Corporation. The final interpreter was developed by John Dickenson, Jerry Barber, and John Teeter at the University of Idaho on a contract with LLL. Taking 5K, it included a floating-point package, developed by David Mead, Hal Brand, and Frank Olken. The program was placed into the public domain by LLL, which developed the system under the auspices of the
U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration.

===4K BASICs===
Altair BASIC, 4K BASIC, could run within a 4 KB RAM machine, leaving only about 790 bytes free for program code. The Tiny BASIC initiative started in response to the $150 charge for Altair 4K BASIC.

In 1975, Steve Wozniak joined the newly formed Homebrew Computer Club, which had fellow members Li-Chen Wang (Palo Alto Tiny BASIC) and Tom Pittman (6800 Tiny BASIC). Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the MOS Technology 6502 processor. As the language needed 4 KB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design. Integer BASIC was originally published on Compact Cassette in 1976.

In 1977, Radio Shack (as it was known then) released their first computer, the TRS-80, a Z80 system with Level I BASIC in a 4 KB ROM. Tandy-employee Steve Leininger had written the first draft of the NIBL (National Industrial Basic Language) interpreter for the SC/MP while employed at National Semiconductor.
 Unable to take that source code with him, he adapted Li-Chen Wang&#x27;s Palo Alto Tiny BASIC for the original prototype of the TRS-80 Model I. He extensively revised the interpreter, adding floating-point support, simple black-and-white graphics, and statements.

Originally developed in 1979, Sinclair 4K BASIC, written by John Grant, used as its language definition the 1978 American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Minimal BASIC standard, but was itself an incomplete 4 KB implementation with integer arithmetic only.

===Microcontroller dialects===
Tiny BASIC implementations have been adapted for processor control and for microcontrollers such as the Arduino:
* Stephen A. Ness wrote XYBASIC for the Mark Williams Company in 1977, a 4K integer implementation. The language was often used for process control applications.
* Arduino BASIC – adapted from Gordon Brandly&#x27;s 68000 Tiny BASIC, ported to C by Mike Field.
* TinyBasic Plus – adapted from Arduino BASIC by Scott Lawrence.
* Half-Byte Tiny Basic – adapted from Arduino BASIC.
* Tiny Basic on the micro:bit – adapted from Palo Alto Tiny BASIC.

===Later implementations===
In 2002, Emmanuel Chailloux, Pascal Manoury and Bruno Pagano published a Tiny BASIC (lacking /) in &quot;Developing Applications with Objective Caml&quot; as an example Objective Caml application.

In 2013, Alex Yang published an implementation in Python.

In 2019, Sergey Kuznetsov published a version in Ruby. 

Also in 2019, Oscar Toledo Gutierrez published bootBASIC, which fits in the 512 bytes of the boot sector of an 8086/8088 machine, making it the smallest BASIC implementation yet. To accomplish this, the language drops relational operators (IF statements work on nonzero values), limits lines of code to 19 characters or less, and doesn&#x27;t update the display when backspace is pressed. Additionally, it lacks GOSUB and RETURN but does include a RND function (without arguments, returning a value between 0 and 255). The language uses an array to store program lines, requiring 20,000 bytes to do so.

In 2023, Gordon Henderson published a Tiny Basic implementation in 6502 assembler. It is influenced by NIBL and can run in as little as 3.5KB of ROM requiring at least 1KB of RAM for data and program storage. It supports DO/UNTIL, FOR/NEXT, simple strings and memory peek/poke (byte or 16-bit word), GOSUB/RETURN, CALL, RND with facilities for hexadecimal input and output.

<text>Anthony of Padua, OFM, (; ; ) or Anthony of Lisbon (; ; ; born Fernando Martins de Bulhões; 15 August 1195 – 13 June 1231) was a Portuguese Catholic priest and member of the Order of Friars Minor.

Anthony was born and raised by a wealthy family in Lisbon, Portugal, and died in Padua, Italy. Noted by his contemporaries for his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of scripture, and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick, he was one of the most quickly canonized saints in church history, being canonized less than a year after his death.

He was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius XII on 16 January 1946.

== Life ==
=== Early years ===

Anthony was born Fernando Martins de Bulhões in Lisbon, Portugal. While 15th-century writers state that his parents were Vicente Martins and Teresa Pais Taveira, and that his father was the brother of Pedro Martins de Bulhões, the ancestor of the Bulhão or Bulhões family, Niccolò Dal-Gal views this as less certain. His wealthy and noble family arranged for him to be instructed at the local cathedral school. At the age of 15, he was received into the Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross at the Abbey of Saint Vincent on the outskirts of Lisbon.

In 1212, distracted by frequent visits from family and friends, he asked to be transferred to the motherhouse of the congregation, the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Coimbra, then the capital of Portugal. There, the young Fernando studied theology and Latin.

=== Joining the Franciscans ===
After his ordination to the priesthood, Fernando was named guestmaster at the age of 19, and placed in charge of hospitality for the abbey. While he was in Coimbra, some Friars Minor arrived and settled at a small hermitage outside Coimbra dedicated to St. Anthony the Great. Fernando was strongly attracted to the simple, evangelical lifestyle of the friars, whose order had been founded only 11 years prior. News arrived that five Franciscans had been beheaded in Morocco, the first of their order to be killed. King Afonso II of Portugal ransomed their bodies to be returned and buried as martyrs in the Monastery of the Holy Cross. Inspired by their example, Fernando obtained permission from church authorities to leave the Canons Regular to join the new Franciscan order. Upon his admission to the life of the friars, he joined the small hermitage in Olivais, adopting the name Anthony (from the name of the chapel located there, dedicated to Anthony the Great), by which he was to be known.

Anthony then set out for Morocco, in fulfilment of his new vocation. However, he fell seriously ill in Morocco and set sail back for Portugal in hope of regaining his health. On the return voyage, the ship was pushed off course and landed in Sicily.

From Sicily, he made his way to Tuscany, where he was assigned to a convent of the order, but he was met with difficulty on account of his sickly appearance. He was finally assigned to the rural hermitage of (&#x27;mount of Saint Paul of Dovadola&#x27;), near Forlì, in Romagna, a choice made after considering his poor health. There, he had recourse to a cell one of the friars had made in a nearby cave, spending time in private prayer and study.

=== Preaching and teaching ===

In 1222, in the town of Forlì, a number of visiting Dominican friars were present for the occasion of an ordination, and a misunderstanding arose over who should preach. The Franciscans had expected that one of the Dominicans would occupy the pulpit, being renowned for their preaching. However, the Dominicans had come unprepared, thinking a Franciscan would be the homilist. In this quandary, the head of the hermitage, who did not think any of his own humble friars could give a homily for the occasion, called upon Anthony, whom he suspected was most qualified, and entreated him to speak whatever the Holy Spirit might inspire. Anthony objected, but was overruled, and his impromptu sermon created a deep impression on his audience. His audience was moved not only by his rich voice and arresting manner, but also by the theme and substance of his discourse, his deep knowledge of scripture, and the eloquence with which he delivered his message.

Anthony was then sent by Brother Gratian, the local minister provincial, to the Franciscan province of Romagna, based in Bologna. He soon came to the attention of the founder of the order, Francis of Assisi. Francis had held a strong distrust of the place of theological studies in the life of his brotherhood, fearing it might lead to an abandonment of their commitment to a life of real poverty and service. In Anthony, however, he found a kindred spirit who shared his vision and could also provide the teaching any young members of the order seeking ordination might need. In 1224, he entrusted the pursuit of studies for any of his friars to the care of Anthony.

The traditional practice of praying for St. Anthony&#x27;s help in finding lost or stolen things is traced to an incident during his lifetime that occurred in Bologna. According to the story, Anthony had a book of psalms that was important to him, as it contained his notes and comments for use in teaching his students. A novice who had chosen to leave had taken the psalter with him. Prior to the invention of the printing press, any book was hand-copied, and thus, an item of high value; a Franciscan friar in particular, given his vow of poverty, would have found such an item difficult to replace. When Anthony realized his psalter was missing, he prayed it would be found or returned, after which the thief was moved to not only return the book to Anthony, but also return to the order. The stolen book is said to be preserved in the Franciscan friary in Bologna.

Occasionally, Anthony took another post as a teacher at universities like University of Montpellier and University of Toulouse in southern France, but his preaching was considered to be his supreme gift. According to historian Sophronius Clasen, Anthony preached &quot;the grandeur of Christianity&quot;. His method included allegory and symbolical explanation of scripture. In 1226, after attending the general chapter of his order held at Arles, France, and preaching in the region of Provence, Anthony returned to Italy and was appointed Provincial superior of northern Italy. He chose the city of Padua as his location.

In 1228, he served as envoy from the general chapter to Pope Gregory IX. At the papal court, his preaching was hailed as a &quot;jewel case of the Bible&quot; and he was commissioned to produce his collection of sermons, &quot;Sermons for Feast Days&quot; &quot;(Sermones in Festivitates)&quot;. Gregory IX described Anthony as the &quot;Ark of the Testament&quot; &quot;(Doctor Arca testamenti)&quot;.

== Miracles ==

The story of Anthony &quot;preaching to the fish&quot; originated in Rimini, where he had gone to preach. When heretics there treated him with contempt, Anthony was said to have gone to the shoreline, where he began to preach at the water&#x27;s edge until a great crowd of fish was seen gathered before him. The people of the town and even heretics flocked to see this marvelous thing and were moved to listen to Anthony&#x27;s preaching.

In another often-told story, which took place also in Rimini, Anthony was challenged by a heretic to prove the reality of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The man, who sought to mock Anthony, brought out a half-starved mule and showed it fresh fodder. Saint Anthony showed the mule the monstrance containing the Blessed Sacrament. The mule ignored the fodder and bowed before the Blessed Sacrament. The Tempietto of Sant&#x27;Antonio marks the spot where the miracle took place. Other versions of this miracle place it in Toulouse or Bourges.

Another account tells of an occasion in Italy when Anthony was dining with heretics. He realized the food they put before him was poisoned, and he confronted them. The men admitted to attempting to kill him, but then challenged him to eat if he truly believed the words spoken in Mark 16:18 about the apostles of Christ: &quot;and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them&quot;. Anthony is said to have blessed the food and eaten it without harm, much to the amazement of his hosts.

== Death ==

Anthony became sick with ergotism in 1231 and went to the woodland retreat at Camposampiero with two other friars for a respite. There, he lived in a room built for him under the branches of a walnut tree. Anthony died on the way back to Padua on 13 June 1231 at the Poor Clare monastery at Arcella (now part of Padua), at the age of 35.

As he had requested, Anthony was buried in the small church of Santa Maria Mater Domini—probably dating from the late 12th century—near a convent he had founded in 1229. Because of his notability, the construction of a large church, now the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, was begun around 1232 and completed in 1301. The smaller church was incorporated into the structure as the Cappella della Madonna Mora or Chapel of the Dark Madonna. Today the basilica is commonly referred to as &quot;Il Santo&quot; (The Saint).

Various legends also surround the death of Anthony. One holds that when he died, children cried in the streets and all the church bells rang of their own accord. According to another legend, when he was initially buried his tongue, jaw, and vocal cords were chosen as relics for veneration and displayed in a large reliquary. When his body was exhumed 30 years after his death, it was found turned to dust, but the tongue was claimed to have glistened and looked as if it were still part of a live body; a further claim being made that this was a sign of his gift of preaching. On 1 January 1981, Pope John Paul II authorized a scientific team to study Anthony&#x27;s remains and the tomb was opened five days later.

== Saint and Doctor of the Church ==
Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on 30 May 1232, at Spoleto, Italy, less than one year after his death. In the words of Pope Benedict XVI:
== Veneration as patron saint ==
Anthony&#x27;s fame spread through Portuguese evangelization, and he has been known as the most celebrated of the followers of Francis of Assisi. He is the patron saint of Padua and many places in Portugal and in the countries of the former Portuguese Empire.

He is especially invoked and venerated all over the world as the patron saint for the recovery of lost items and is credited with many miracles involving lost people, lost things and even lost spiritual goods.

St. Anthony Chaplets help devotees to meditate on the thirteen virtues of the saint. Some of these chaplets were used by members of confraternities that had Anthony as their patron saint.

=== North America ===
In 1692, Spanish missionaries came across a small Payaya Indian community along what was then known as the Yanaguana River on the feast day of Saint Anthony, 13 June. The Franciscan chaplain, Father Damien Massanet, with agreement from General Domingo de Teran, renamed the rivers in his honor, and eventually built a mission nearby, as well. This mission became the focal point of a small community that eventually grew in size and scope to become the seventh-largest city in the country, the U.S. city of San Antonio, Texas.

In New York City, the Shrine Church of St. Anthony in Greenwich Village, Manhattan celebrates his feast day, starting with the traditional novena of prayers asking for his intercession on the 13 Tuesdays preceding his feast. This culminates with a week-long series of services and a street fair. A traditional Italian-style procession is held that day through the streets of its South Village neighborhood, during which a relic of the saint is carried for veneration.

Each year on the weekend of the last Sunday in August, Boston&#x27;s North End holds a feast in honor of Saint Anthony. Referred to as the &quot;Feast of All Feasts&quot;, Saint Anthony&#x27;s Feast in Boston&#x27;s North End was begun in 1919 by Italian immigrants from Montefalcione, a small town near Naples, where the tradition of honoring Saint Anthony goes back to 1688.

Each year the Sandia Pueblo along with Santa Clara Pueblo celebrates the feast day of Saint Anthony with traditional Native American dances.

On 27 January 1907, in Beaumont, Texas, a church was dedicated and named in honor of Saint Anthony. The church was later designated a cathedral in 1966 with the formation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Beaumont, but was not formally consecrated. On 28 April 1974, St. Anthony Cathedral was dedicated and consecrated by Bishop Warren Boudreaux. In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI granted the cathedral the designation of minor basilica. St. Anthony Cathedral Basilica celebrated its 100th anniversary on 28 January 2007.

St. Anthony gives his name to Mission San Antonio de Padua, the third Franciscan mission dedicated along El Camino Real in California in 1771.

In Ellicott City, Maryland, southwest of Baltimore, the Conventual Franciscans of the St. Anthony Province dedicated their old novitiate house as the Shrine of St. Anthony which since 1 July 2004 serves as the official shrine to Saint Anthony for the Archdiocese of Baltimore.

=== Portugal, Spain and Brazil ===
Saint Anthony is known in Portugal, Spain, and Brazil as a marriage saint, because legends exist of him reconciling couples. His feast day, 13 June, is Lisbon&#x27;s municipal holiday, celebrated with parades and marriages (the previous day, 12 June, is the &quot;Dia dos Namorados&quot; in Brazil). He is one of the saints celebrated in the Brazilian &quot;Festa Junina&quot;, along with John the Baptist and Saint Peter. He is venerated in Mogán Village in Gran Canaria, where his feast day is celebrated every year with oversized objects carried through the streets for the fiesta.

=== The rest of Europe ===
In Albania, the Franciscans arrived in 1240 spreading the word of Saint Anthony &quot;(Shna Ndou)&quot;. The St. Anthony Church, Laç () in Laç was built in his honor. Saint Anthony is one of the most important saints amongst Albanians and the pilgrimage to his church is done yearly by a considerable number of Eastern Orthodox and Muslim Albanians as well.

Saint Anthony lived and died during the episcopates of Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Mark III of Alexandria and Patriarch Nicholas I of Alexandria, both of whom still maintained communion with the Pope of Rome.

In the town of Brusciano, Italy, located near Naples, an annual feast in honor of Saint Anthony is held in late August. This tradition dates back to 1875. The tradition started when a man prayed to Saint Anthony for his sick son to get better. He vowed that if his son would become healthy he would build and dance a &quot;giglio&quot; like the people of Nola do for their patron San Paolino during the annual Fest Dei Gigli. (A &quot;giglio&quot; is a tall tower topped with a statue of the saint that is carried through the streets in carefully choreographed maneuvers that resemble a dance.) The celebration has grown over the years to include six giglio towers built in honor of the saint. This tradition has also carried over to America, specifically the East Harlem area of New York, where the immigrants from the town of Brusciano formed the Giglio Society of East Harlem and have been holding their annual feast since the early 1900s.

In Poland, he is the patron saint of Przeworsk. The icon of Saint Anthony, dating from 1649, is housed in a local Franciscan church, .

=== Asia ===
Saint Anthony is honored in Uvari, in Tamil Nadu, India, where legend holds that the crew of a Portuguese ship was cured of cholera through the intercession of St. Anthony. The local church is dedicated to St. Anthony and houses an ancient wooden statue believed to have been carved by one of the crew. In Kerala, where Vasco da Gama had landed in 1498 and where the Portuguese had their first stations in India some of the most ancient churches were renamed after St. Antony and new churches were dedicated to him.

In the Philippines, the devotion to St. Anthony of Padua began in 1581, in the town of Pila, Laguna, where Franciscans established the first church in the country dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, now elevated as the National Shrine of St. Anthony of Padua under the Diocese of San Pablo.

In Siolim, a village in the Indian state of Goa, St. Anthony is always shown holding a serpent on a stick. This is a depiction of the incident which occurred during the construction of the church wherein a snake was disrupting construction work. The people turned to St. Anthony for help and placed his statue at the construction site. The next morning, the snake was found caught in the cord placed in the statue&#x27;s hand.

St. Anthony&#x27;s Shrine, Kochchikade, located in Sri Lanka, is dedicated to the saint. The church is designated a national shrine and minor basilica. A tiny piece of St. Anthony&#x27;s tongue is said to be preserved in a special reliquary, which is located in a glass case together with a statue of the saint, at the entrance to the church.

=== Africa ===
Antonianism () was a syncretic Bakongo Catholic movement formed in the Kingdom of Kongo between 1704 and 1708 as a development out of the Roman Catholic Church in Kongo, yet without denying the authority of the Pope. Its founder was a young charismatic woman named Beatriz Kimpa Vita who said she was possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua. Beatriz became known for healing and other miracles. It was eventually suppressed by King Pedro IV of Kongo, and Dona Beatriz was burned at the stake as a heretic.

== In art ==
As the number of Franciscan saints increased, iconography struggled to distinguish Anthony from the others. Because of a legend that he had once preached to the fish by the mouth of the river Marecchia in Rimini, this was sometimes used as his attribute. He is also often seen with a white lily stalk, representing his purity. Other conventions referred to St. Anthony&#x27;s visionary fervor. Thus, one attribute in use for some time was a flaming heart. He is also sometimes depicted along with the mule in Rimini that allegedly bowed down to him holding the Eucharist.

In 1511, Titian painted three large frescoes in the Scuola del Santo in Padua, depicting scenes of the miracles from the life of Saint Anthony: &quot;The Miracle of the Jealous Husband&quot;, which depicts the murder of a young woman by her husband; &quot;A Child Testifying to Its Mother&#x27;s Innocence&quot;; and &quot;The Saint Healing the Young Man with a Broken Limb&quot;.

Another key pattern has him meditating on an open book in which the Christ Child himself appears, as in the El Greco below. Over time the child came to be shown considerably larger than the book and some images even do without the book entirely. He typically appears carrying the infant Jesus and holding a cross.

In popular votive offerings, Anthony is often depicted as miraculously saving individuals in various accidents.

=== In music ===
The Austrian composer Gustav Mahler&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; contains the song &quot;Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt&quot;, whose lyrics recount the story of Saint Anthony&#x27;s sermon to the fish. This song later formed the basis for the scherzo movement of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2. In correspondence, Mahler expressed amusement that his sinuous musical setting could imply St. Anthony of Padua was himself drunk as he preached to the fish.

<text>The year 668 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 86 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 668 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Opatija (; ; ) is a town and a municipality in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County in northwestern Croatia. The traditional seaside resort on the Kvarner Gulf is known for its Mediterranean climate and its historic buildings reminiscent of the Austrian Riviera.

==Geography==

Opatija is located northwest of the regional capital Rijeka, about from Trieste by rail and from Pula by road. The city is geographically on the Istrian peninsula, though not in Istria County. The tourist resort is situated on the Kvarner Gulf, part of the Adriatic coast, in a sheltered position at the foot of Učka massif, with the &quot;Vojak&quot; peak reaching at a height of . census, the municipality had 10,661 inhabitants in total, of which 5,715 lived in the urban settlement.

The town is a popular summer and winter resort, with average high temperatures of 10 °C in winter, and 32 °C in summer. Opatija is surrounded by beautiful woods of bay laurel. The whole sea-coast to the north and south of Opatija is rocky and picturesque, and contains several smaller winter resorts.

==History==
Opatija was included in the territory of the Liburni, a pre-Roman Illyrian tribe. In Roman times, the area was home to several patrician villas connected to the nearby town of &quot;Castrum Laureana&quot;, the modern Lovran.

Croats settled in the region from about 700 AD onwards. Conquered by King Pepin of Italy, son of Charlemagne, in 789, the Istrian peninsula up to the Kvarner Gulf was incorporated into the Carolingian March of Friuli by 803. In the east, it bordered on the medieval Kingdom of Croatia established by King Tomislav about 925. Having invaded Italy, King Otto of Germany made the Istrian lands part of the vast March of Verona and Aquileia; from the 11th century onwards, the Imperial estates were held by the Patriarchs of Aquileia.

In the Middle Ages the current town&#x27;s territory was divided between Veprinac (now a locality of Opatija, perhaps home to a small fishing port) and Kastav, where the fisherman village of Veprinac. The small hamlet of Opatija itself developed around a Benedictine abbey dedicated to Saint Jacob, which was first mentioned in 1453. While western Istria was gradually conquered by the Republic of Venice by 1420, the remaining territory up to Opatija fell to the House of Habsburg and later was incorporated into the Austrian Littoral.

The town&#x27;s modern history began in 1844, when Iginio Scarpa (1794–1866), a wealthy merchant from Rijeka, had the Villa Angiolina manor built in an extended park, where he received notable guests such as Ban Josip Jelačić. In 1873 the Austrian Southern Railway company from Vienna opened the branch line from Pivka to Rijeka via nearby Matulji and thus opened the path for the development of tourism in Opatija and neighbouring Lovran. In 1882, the railway company purchased the Villa Angiolina, where it accommodated the crown princely couple Rudolf and Stéphanie. At the time, Friedrich Julius Schüler (1832–1894), the Managing Director of the Southern Railways, started the construction of the &quot;Hotel Quarnero&quot; (Kvarner Hotel) and the &quot;Hotel Kronprinzessin Stephanie&quot; (present-day Hotel Imperial), and also was responsible for the unique lungomare and parks (the Company engaged Carl Schubert, director of the Viennese Emperial-Royal Society for the construction of parks). The Villa Angiolina was later run by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. In the Angiolina Park today stands Schüler&#x27;s bust, a work of the sculptor Hans Rathausky.

In 1887, Heinrich von Littrow established the &quot;Union Yacht Club Quarnero&quot; in Opatija (founded in June/July 1886); this was the first sailing club on the Adriatic coast. In 1889 the Cisleithanian government officially declared Abbazia (Opatija) the first climatic seaside resort (&quot;Seebad&quot;) on the Austrian Riviera, rivalled by Brioni, Duino, Grado, and Portorož. After the hotels, the building of villas started, for the needs of more demanding noble guests. The first Villa Amalia, in the immediate vicinity of the Hotel Quarnero, was built in 1890 as the hotel&#x27;s annex. Opatija&#x27;s first guide was published in 1883 in Vienna with the title &quot;Abbazia, Idylle von der Adria&quot;. The same year saw the publication of &quot;Abbazia und seine Umgebung&quot; (&quot;Opatija and its Environs&quot;) by Heinrich Noe, who in 1884 published his &quot;Tagebuch aus Abbazia (Diary from Opatija)&quot;. Joseph Rable printed &quot;Curort und Seebad Abbazia (Spa and the bathing beach in Opatija)&quot;, and Peter von Radics wrote a guidebook simply titled &quot; Abbazia&quot;. 

In 1908 a tramway line was opened, running from Matulji station along the coast via Opatija down to Lovran in the south. Opatija is best known nowadays as the venue for a 1912 chess tournament devoted to the King’s Gambit. The Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I used to spend several months there during the winter. He met there with the German emperor Wilhelm II on 29 March 1894; other crowned heads seeking relaxation included Empress Elisabeth of Austria and the German empress Augusta Victoria, King Carol I of Romania and his consort Elisabeth, King George I of Greece, Albert, King of Saxony, William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Prince Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš. Many of the late 19th-century luxury hotels and villas have survived to present times.

During World War I the Hotel Icicii was converted to a military hospital. The accompanying pictures show the nursing staff and wounded at lunch, on the grounds, and receiving care. In 1920 Opatija was assigned to Italy. The upper floor of Villa Amalia was built in 1930, and the building was renovated to become the summer residence of the House of Savoy.

In 1947 Opatija was given to Yugoslavia as part of the peace treaty with Italy; most of the Italian-speaking population emigrated to Italy. In 1963 the Hotel Adriatic, by the architect Andrija Čičin-Šain and his team was completed. Hotel &quot;Adriatic&quot; was the first hotel built in Opatija after the Austro-Hungarian era. The rooms of hotel &quot;Adriatic&quot; have been described as novelties in the hospitality industry. The &quot;Casino Rosalia&quot; was opened in Opatija – the first casino in Eastern Europe. In 1981 the Hotel &quot;Admiral&quot; and marina (200 berths and 40 dry berths) were completed. 
After the breakup of Yugoslavia which began in 1991, the town became part of Croatia.

The 14th-century Benedictine abbey, &quot;Opatija Sv. Jakova&quot; (&quot;Abbey of Saint Jacob&quot;), from which the town derives its name (&quot;opatija&quot; means &quot;abbey&quot; in Croatian) is located in &quot;Park Svetog Jakova&quot; or Saint Jacob&#x27;s Park. Saint Jacob&#x27;s church, built in 1506 and enlarged in 1937, now stands on the same spot. The neo-Romanesque Church of the Annunciation with its pronounced green cupola, was designed in 1906 by architect Karl Seidl.

Another sight is the Villa Angiolina, built in 1844 by Iginio Scarpa. This villa, transformed into a museum. Since 1844. Villa Angiolina had many prominent guests

Opatija is known for the &quot;Maiden with the seagull&quot;, a statue by Zvonko Car (1956), which is positioned on a promontory by the Juraj Šporer art pavilion. It has turned into one of symbols of Opatija. A gilded variant of the statue Madonna, that once stood here but was demolished by communists after the end of World War II, now stands in front of Saint Jacob&#x27;s Church.

The town park Angiolina contains many species of plants from all over the world. It has been protected since 1968. Close-by, vis-a-vis Hotel Imperial, stands the statue &quot;The Fountain - Helios and Selena&quot;, a work of the Austrian sculptor Hans Rathautsky from 1889. There is a 12 km-long promenade along the entire riviera, the Lungomare from Volosko, via Opatija, to Lovran and a 7 km-long forest path walk, the Šetalište Carmen Sylve, named after Elisabeth of Wied, Queen consort of Romania, widely known by her literary name of Carmen Sylva.

<doc id="86908" wikidata="Q1265942" url="?curid=86908" title="FIFO and LIFO accounting">
<text>FIFO and LIFO accounting are methods used in managing inventory and financial matters involving the amount of money a company has to have tied up within inventory of produced goods, raw materials, parts, components, or feedstocks. They are used to manage assumptions of costs related to inventory, stock repurchases (if purchased at different prices), and various other accounting purposes. The following equation is useful when determining inventory costing methods:

formula_1

==FIFO==

&quot;FIFO&quot; stands for &quot;first-in, first-out&quot;, meaning that the oldest inventory items are recorded as sold first (but this does not necessarily mean that the exact oldest physical object has been tracked and sold). In other words, the cost associated with the inventory that was purchased first is the cost expensed first. 

A company might use the LIFO method for accounting purposes, even if it uses FIFO for inventory management purposes (i.e., for the actual storage, shelving, and sale of its merchandise). For example, a company that sells many perishable goods, such as a supermarket chain, is likely to follow the FIFO method when managing inventory, to ensure that goods with earlier expiration dates are sold before goods with later expiration dates. However, this does not preclude that same company from accounting for its merchandise with the LIFO method. 

With FIFO, the cost of inventory reported on the balance sheet represents the cost of the inventory purchased earliest. FIFO most closely mimics the flow of inventory, as businesses are far more likely to sell the oldest inventory first.

Consider this example: Foo Co. had the following inventory at hand, in order of acquisition in November:
If Foo Co. sells 210 units during November, the company would expense the cost associated with the first 100 units at $50 and the remaining 110 units at $55. Under FIFO, the total cost of sales for November would be $11,050. The ending inventory would be calculated the following way:
 
Thus, the balance sheet would now show the inventory valued at $5250.

=== FIFO Tax Implications ===
FIFO will have a higher ending inventory value and lower cost of goods sold (COGS) compared to LIFO in a period of rising prices. Therefore, under these circumstances, FIFO would produce a higher gross profit and, similarly, a higher income tax expense.

==LIFO==

&quot;LIFO&quot; stands for &quot;last-in, first-out&quot;, meaning that the most recently purchased items are recorded as sold first. Since the 1970s, some U.S. companies shifted towards the use of LIFO, which reduces their income taxes in times of inflation, but since International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) banned LIFO, more companies returned to FIFO.

LIFO is used only in the United States, which is governed by the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Section 472 of the Internal Revenue Code directs how LIFO may be used if necessary. The code directs that LIFO may be used &quot;only if the taxpayer establishes&quot; that they have no other way of valuing their inventory.

In the FIFO example above, the company (Foo Co.), using LIFO accounting, would expense the cost associated with the first 75 units at $59, 125 more units at $55, and the remaining 10 units at $50. Under LIFO, the total cost of sales for November would be $11,800. The ending inventory would be calculated the following way:
The balance sheet would show $4500 in inventory under LIFO.

The difference between the cost of an inventory calculated under the FIFO and LIFO methods is called the &quot;LIFO reserve&quot; (in the example above, it is $750, i.e. $5250 - $4500). This reserve, a form of contra account, is essentially the amount by which an entity&#x27;s taxable income has been deferred by using the LIFO method.

In most sets of accounting standards, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards, FIFO (or LIFO) valuation principles are &quot;in-fine&quot; subordinated to the higher principle of lower of cost or market valuation.

In the United States, publicly traded entities which use LIFO for taxation purposes must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes, but such companies are also likely to report a LIFO reserve to their shareholders. A number of tax reform proposals have argued for the repeal of LIFO tax provision. The &quot;Save LIFO Coalition&quot; argues in favor of the retention of LIFO.

<doc id="86913" wikidata="Q348017" url="?curid=86913" title="Bobby Orr">
<text>Robert Gordon Orr (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest of all time. Orr used his skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, the first 10 with the Boston Bruins, followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. He holds the record for most points and assists in a single season by a defenceman. Orr won a record eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman and three consecutive Hart Trophies as the league&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP). Orr was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979 at age 31, the youngest to be inducted at that time. In 2017, Orr was named by the National Hockey League as one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

Orr started in organized hockey at age eight. He first played as a forward, but moved to defence and was encouraged to use his skating skills to control play. Orr&#x27;s play in Ontario provincial competition attracted the notice of NHL scouts as early as age twelve. At fourteen, Orr joined the Oshawa Generals, the Bruins&#x27; junior hockey affiliate, and he was an all-star for three of his four seasons there.

In 1966, Orr joined the Boston Bruins, a team that had not won a Stanley Cup since 1941 and had not made the playoffs since 1959. With Orr, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1970 and 1972. Both times, Orr scored the clinching goal and was named the playoff MVP. In the final achievement of his career, he was the MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup international hockey tournament. In 1976, Orr left Boston as a free agent to join the Black Hawks, but repeated injuries had effectively destroyed his left knee, and he retired in 1978 at age 30.

Orr&#x27;s first professional contract was one of the first in professional hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson&#x27;s fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported a lawsuit that challenged the NHL over its control of its pension plan.

After his hockey career, he became a scout for several professional teams. Orr entered the player agent business in 1996 and was the president of the Orr Hockey Group agency, until its acquisition by the Wasserman Media Group in 2018. Orr is also active in charitable works and in television commercials. Since 1996, Orr has coached a team of junior hockey players in the annual CHL Top Prospects Game.

==Hockey career==

===Early life===
Orr was born in the town of Parry Sound on the shores of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada. His grandfather, Robert Orr, was a top-tier soccer pro player who emigrated from Ballymena, Northern Ireland to Parry Sound early in the 20th century. Orr&#x27;s father, Doug Orr, had once been a hockey prospect and was invited to join the Atlantic City Seagulls in 1942 but turned down the offer. Doug Orr instead joined the Royal Canadian Navy, serving during the Second World War. He returned after the war to Parry Sound and Arva Steele, whom he had married before he left for war, and to a job in the CIL dynamite factory. Doug and Arva had five children together: Patricia, Ronnie, Bobby, Penny, and Doug Jr. Bobby was born on March 20, 1948, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, where his grandmother Elsie Orr was a nurse. Bobby was a sick baby at birth and his survival was tenuous.

Bobby Orr displayed his hockey talents from an early age. Orr played his first organized hockey in 1953 at age five, in the &quot;minor squirt&quot; division, a year after getting his first skates and playing shinny. Although he was tiny and somewhat frail, he soon was able to skate faster than anyone his own age, with speed he demonstrated in races around the rink and in games. Until he was ten years old, Orr played on the wing, as a forward. His coach, former NHL player Bucko McDonald, moved Orr to defence. Although Orr played defence, McDonald encouraged Orr to use his talents as a stickhandler, skater, and scorer to make offensive rushes. According to McDonald: &quot;I used to tell Doug the kid was in his natural position when he played defence. You didn&#x27;t have to be genius to see that – honest. I don&#x27;t think Doug agreed, but he accepted my decision.&quot; Orr would later credit McDonald: &quot;Bucko taught me almost everything I know.&quot;

Orr was noticed by the Boston Bruins in the spring of 1961, playing in a youth hockey tournament in Gananoque, Ontario. The Bruins&#x27; Wren Blair described him as &quot;a combination of Doug Harvey and Eddie Shore.&quot; The Bruins immediately pursued Orr. Blair made regular visits to the family home. In the fall of 1961, the Bruins invested (CA$ in dollars) to sponsor his minor hockey team. Although three other NHL teams (Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, and Montreal Canadiens) were interested in Orr, he signed in 1962 with the Bruins. Orr explained that he signed with the Bruins because &quot;they&#x27;re a team of the future. They&#x27;re rebuilding and I want to be part of that building program.&quot;

Blair was involved with a plan to start a new Oshawa Generals franchise in a new arena in Oshawa, Ontario. Despite the Bruins already having a junior hockey franchise, the Niagara Falls Flyers, Blair convinced the Bruins to own another. He arranged a deal whereby the Bruins owned 51% of the franchise, but Orr would have to play for Oshawa. When Orr was fourteen, Blair convinced the Orr family to allow Bobby to attend the Flyers&#x27; tryout camp. When camp ended and it came time to sign with the Bruins, a meeting with Bruins&#x27; owner Weston Adams went sour and Orr headed back to Parry Sound. Blair was able to smooth over the situation and convince Arva that Bobby was old enough to leave home. To get the Orrs&#x27; signatures on a &quot;C&quot; Form, committing Bobby to the Bruins at age eighteen, Blair agreed to have Bobby stay in Parry Sound for his schooling, skipping Generals&#x27; practices and only driving south to play games on weekends, a three-hour trip one way. The bonus for signing was (CA$ in dollars), a new car and the Bruins would pay to stucco the family home.

Orr debuted in junior hockey in the 1962–63 season for the new Generals in the new Metro Junior A League. Orr was only fourteen, competing against eighteen-, nineteen- and twenty-year-olds. The 1963–64 season brought further changes as the Metro League folded and Oshawa joined the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). Orr moved to Oshawa, where he started attending R. S. McLaughlin high school and boarded with a local family. Orr scored 29 goals to set a junior record for goals by a defenceman and was named to the OHA&#x27;s first All-Star team.

Orr&#x27;s goal and point totals increased every year during his junior career, and he was named to the OHA First-All Star team every season he was in the OHA. Orr had his best season in 1965–66, his fourth season of junior. Orr scored 38 goals to increase his goal-scoring record and finished with 94 points to average two points per game for the Generals. The Generals finished fourth in the league, but won the OHA championship, the J. Ross Robertson Cup, by defeating the St. Catharines Black Hawks, the Montreal Junior Canadiens and the Kitchener Rangers. The team defeated the Northern Ontario champions North Bay Trappers and the Quebec champions Shawinigan Bruins to win a berth in the Memorial Cup Final for the junior championship of Canada.

Oshawa&#x27;s hopes in the 1966 Memorial Cup Final were damaged when Orr suffered a groin injury against Shawinigan, a painful injury that weakens a player&#x27;s skating ability. To promote the event, held in Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens, the Generals had advertised it would be the last chance to see Orr in junior and were anxious for him to play. Bruins&#x27; management demanded Orr not play in the Final, not wanting to risk further damage to their property. Orr and his parents, however, were adamant he be allowed to play for the national championship. As he had not signed to the Bruins, they threatened he would never play for Boston if he was held out. Blair decided to defy the Bruins&#x27; ownership and let Orr play. While Orr dressed and played some, he was not a factor and Edmonton defeated Oshawa for the Cup. Oshawa coach Bep Guidolin was fired for letting Orr play, while Blair left the organization of his own accord to join the expansion Minnesota North Stars.

===Orr and Eagleson===
By the time Orr turned 16 in 1964, he was still two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was dissatisfied with the Bruins&#x27; treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins&#x27; Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed to work with the family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby&#x27;s future plans without his father Doug.

Eagleson was determined to get Orr a top salary. When Hap Emms, the general manager of the Bruins offered a US$5,000 (US$ in dollars) signing bonus and US$7,000 and US$8,000 (US$ and US$ in dollars) for his first two years in the league, Eagleson countered with US$100,000 (US$ in dollars) for the two years. Orr would refuse to play with the Bruins and played for Canada&#x27;s national team instead, like Carl Brewer. Orr wanted desperately to play in the NHL, but he went along with Eagleson&#x27;s strategy and was willing to play for the nationals. The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US$25,000 signing bonus (US$ in dollars), and a salary &quot;less than $100,000&quot; for the two years, a figure kept secret. Speculation has ranged on an annual salary of US$25,000 to US$40,000 (US$ to US$ in dollars) at a time when the typical maximum rookie salary was US$9,000. (US$ in dollars) The official signing ceremony was done on Emms&#x27; boat, the &quot;Barbara Lynn&quot;, where Eagleson and Emms had conferred during negotiations.

At the time, it made Orr the highest-paid player in league history. Beyond that, the signing became one of the most important in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player&#x27;s agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.

===Bruins career===

====1966–67====
Orr joined the Bruins for the 1966–67 season, his first as a professional. The Bruins were not convinced Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. With Orr&#x27;s junior number (2) retired in honour of Eddie Shore, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, prior to the regular season, but Orr instead chose jersey number 4, which had been vacated by veteran defenceman Albert Langlois. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation.

In that first season, Orr was challenged by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr&#x27;s knees for the first time in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.

For the season, Orr scored 13 goals and 28 assists, one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history to that point by a defenceman. Orr won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s outstanding rookie and was named to the NHL&#x27;s Second All-Star team. New York Rangers defenceman Harry Howell won the Norris Trophy as the league&#x27;s best defenceman that year. In accepting the award, Howell said he was glad to win when he did, predicting &quot;Orr will own this trophy from now on.&quot; Orr was runner-up in voting.

====1967–68====
In 1967–68, his second season, injuries limited Orr to just 46 games in which he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr&#x27;s collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time to play in the NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage. Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.

After finishing last in 1966–67, the Bruins qualified for the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, the Bruins added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks in one of the most famous deals ever. The Bruins also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive image that led to the nickname of the &#x27;Big Bad Bruins.&#x27; The Bruins, happy to make the playoffs, were swept by eventual champion Montreal in the first round.

====1968–69====
In 1968–69, Orr skipped the pre-season to rest the knee but was in uniform for the season&#x27;s start. He required an ice pack on the knee after every game and missed nine games after he caught a skate in a crack in the ice, twisting his knee. He returned to the line-up and finished the season playing through the pain, sometimes struggling to get up to speed and relying on teammates instead of making the plays himself. In other games, Orr was outstanding, scoring his first career NHL hat trick on December 14 against Chicago, adding two assists for a five-point night. He scored 21 goals on the season, breaking the goal-scoring record for a defenceman, and totalled 64 points to set a new point-scoring record for one season for a defenceman. He again won the Norris Trophy while nabbing a First-Team All-Star selection and finishing third in the Hart Trophy balloting.

Orr feuded with Toronto rookie defenceman Pat Quinn that season. In a late-season game, Orr attempted to knock the puck loose from Maple Leafs goaltender Bruce Gamble and Quinn cross-checked Orr to the ice. Orr kicked Quinn and Quinn kicked Orr. On-ice officials broke it up, but the feud continued into the 1969 playoffs. The Bruins finished second in the NHL&#x27;s East Division and drew the Maple Leafs in the first round. In the first game, in Boston, Quinn caught Orr with his head down during a rush, and caught him with an open-ice hit, knocking Orr unconscious. Quinn, assessed five minutes for elbowing, was attacked in the penalty box by a fan and Quinn swung at the fan with his stick, breaking the glass. When Quinn returned, the Boston fans showered garbage onto the ice. Orr was carried out on a stretcher to the dressing room where he revived after the concussion. According to a Boston police officer at the scene, &quot;The fans here don&#x27;t like anybody to touch Orr. He&#x27;s their Frank Merriwell and Jack Armstrong rolled into one. To my thinking, it looked like a clean check.&quot; The game degenerated into a brawl after the score reached 10–0 for the Bruins. The Bruins went on to sweep the Maple Leafs before losing in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. Orr returned for the third game against Toronto, getting two assists as the Bruins won their first games in Toronto since 1965.

====1969–70: Overtime winner, first cup====

In 1969–70, Orr almost doubled his scoring total from the previous season, to 120 points, six shy of the league record (which had been set by his teammate Phil Esposito the previous season), leading the league in scoring. Orr is still the only defenceman in history to win the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer, which he also achieved a second time, in 1974–75. In addition to the Norris and the Art Ross, Orr captured the first of three consecutive Hart Trophies as regular-season MVP and later won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his playoff performance, becoming the only player in history to win four major NHL awards in one season.

Orr went on to lead the Bruins in a march through the 1970 playoffs scoring nine goals and 11 assists. The march culminated on May 10, 1970, when he scored one of the most famous goals in hockey history and one that gave Boston its first Stanley Cup since 1941. The goal came off a give-and-go pass with teammate Derek Sanderson at the 40-second mark of the first overtime period in the fourth game, helping to complete a sweep of the St. Louis Blues. According to Orr:

If it had gone by me, it&#x27;s a two-on-one, so I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really trying to get the puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn&#x27;s legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.

The subsequent photograph by Ray Lussier of a horizontal Orr flying through the air, his arms raised in victory – he had been tripped by Blues&#x27; defenceman Noel Picard after scoring the goal – has become one of the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time—and today is highlighted in the opening sequence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; telecasts.

====1970–71====
The following season, the powerhouse Bruins shattered dozens of league offensive records. Orr himself finished second in league scoring with 139 points (37 goals and 102 assists), thirteen points behind Esposito, while setting records that still stand for points in a season by a defenceman and for plus-minus (+124) by any position player. Orr&#x27;s 102 assists set a league record that would not be broken until Wayne Gretzky totalled 109 in 1980–81. Orr&#x27;s Bruins were heavy favourites to repeat as Cup champions, but were upset by the Montreal Canadiens and their rookie goaltender Ken Dryden, at one time Bruins&#x27; property, in the first round of the 1971 playoffs.

For the season, the Bruins gave Orr a solid gold puck, one of four they gave out to Bruins players – to each of the four Bruins who scored over 100 points that season – Esposito, Orr, Johnny Bucyk and Ken Hodge. Orr later gave his puck to Alan Eagleson. In 2007, Eagleson sold the puck in an auction of memorabilia for .

====1971–72: Second and final cup====
Orr signed a new five-year contract on August 26, 1971, for US$200,000 (US$ in dollars) per season – the NHL&#x27;s first million dollar contract. In the following 1971–72 season, Orr was again second in the scoring race to Esposito, this time with 117 points, as his goal total matched his previous years total of 37, but his assists dropped to 80. He again won the Hart and Norris trophies, helping the Bruins to a first-place finish in the East. In the 1972 playoffs, Orr again led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup, leading the scoring in the playoffs (24 points with 19 assists) and scoring the championship-winning goal against New York. For his performance in the playoffs, he received his second Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, making him the award&#x27;s first two-time winner. Rangers forward Vic Hadfield commented &quot;We played them pretty even, but they had Bobby Orr and we didn&#x27;t.&quot; By this time, Orr knew his left knee was deteriorating and he would not have many seasons left. Orr also won the MVP award at the 1972 NHL All-Star Game to win three MVP awards in one season. Since then only Nicklas Lidström (2002) and Cale Makar (2022) have won the Norris and Conn Smythe trophies in the same season.

====1972–73====
The 1972–73 saw upheaval at the Bruins. Former head coach Sinden returned to the club as the general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined the upstart World Hockey Association. Coach Tom Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, who had once coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team since its founding in the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins&#x27; season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games due to injury,) but had only two points in the playoff loss.

====1973–74====
In 1973–74, Orr led the Bruins to another first-place finish in the regular season. His point total rebounded to 122 with 32 goals and 90 assists. That season, Orr set the record (since surpassed) for the most points in a game by a defenceman, scoring 3 goals and 4 assists in a November 15, 1973 game against the New York Rangers. One goal, a shot from the blue line, broke Rangers&#x27; defenceman Rod Seiling&#x27;s stick.

The Bruins made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, but lost this time to the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. In game one, late in the third period tied at 2–2, Orr blocked the open Boston net with his leg to keep out a Flyers&#x27; shot on goal, then took the puck up the ice and scored on a slapshot past goaltender Bernie Parent with a little over a minute remaining in regulation time to propel the Bruins to a 3–2 win. In game five, Orr assisted on Boston&#x27;s first goal with shorthanded rush, and scored the next two goals himself as the Bruins won 5–1. In the deciding game six, Orr was in the penalty box after a scuffle with the Flyers&#x27; Bobby Clarke and during the ensuing power play the Flyers scored (which turned out to be the Cup-winning goal), but with 4 seconds left and the Bruins trailing 1-0 Orr took a face-off and sent a desperation length of the ice shot that went just wide of the Flyers&#x27; net (goaltender Parent admitted &quot;If his shot is on net, it&#x27;s a goal&quot;).

====1974–75====
In the 1974–75 season, Orr broke his own previous record for goals by a defenceman, scoring 46 goals to go with 89 assists for his sixth straight 100-point season. His record for goals by a defenceman stood until Paul Coffey totalled 48 in 1985–86. He won the league scoring title and the Art Ross Trophy for the second time. 1974–75 was his last full season and his last season playing with Esposito. The Bruins placed second in the Adams Division, and lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round of the 1975 playoffs, losing the best-of-three series, two games to one. With this season, he had tallied 100 points in six straight seasons, a record for any player of any position, forward, or defencemen (since broken), although his teammate Esposito that season also achieved his sixth (and last) 100-point season, although only five of those were consecutive. In fact, there are only nine other seasons in history of defencemen scoring 100 points or more (Paul Coffey with five, Denis Potvin, Al MacInnis, Brian Leetch, and Erik Karlsson with one each).

====1975–76====
The 1975–76 season was Orr&#x27;s final season with the Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr&#x27;s contract was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr as a condition of the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.

Before the season started, however, Orr underwent another surgical procedure on September 20, 1975. The Bruins&#x27; contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins&#x27; insurer would not insure a contract with Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr would not be able to play much longer. Orr returned to the line-up on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another surgical procedure on his knee. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.

During his Bruins career, Orr was often the player the press wanted for a post-game interview. Orr instead would hide in the trainer&#x27;s room. Teammate Terry O&#x27;Reilly described him as a &quot;very private, very shy guy, who just happened to be the best hockey player in the world.&quot; According to the Bruins public relations director Nate Greenberg &quot;one of my toughest jobs in the day was trying to get Orr to come out of the trainer&#x27;s room to talk to the press. The reason he wouldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t all the time was that he really wanted his teammates to get proper accolades, while everybody, all the time wanted him.&quot; Orr did not authorize a biography of himself until 2013, preferring not to be the centre of attention.

===Free agency, and the move to Chicago===
In September 1975, the Bruins and Eagleson had reached a deal that would pay Orr US$4 million (US$ in dollars) for ten years, but when Orr&#x27;s knee required surgery, the Bruins reduced its offer to US$295,000 (US$ in dollars) per season and a payment of US$925,000 (US$ in dollars) or 18.6% of the Bruins in June 1980. Eagleson turned down the offer and on June 7, 1976, was quoted in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as saying &quot;Boston offered a five-year deal at US$925,000 or 18.6 per cent ownership of the club in 1980. I didn&#x27;t think it would be wise for him to be a player-owner.&quot; On June 9, 1976, after Orr had signed with Chicago, Eagleson told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that the Bruin offer was &quot;a five-year offer for US$295,000 a year. In addition, Orr was to receive US$925,000 in cash payable in June 1980. That was to be a cash payment or involve Orr&#x27;s receiving 18.6 per cent of the Bruins stock.&quot; According to a famous 1990 story in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; by Ellie Tesher, Orr stated that Eagleson never told him of the offer, during negotiations or after. While Eagleson had spoken publicly to reporters of the offer, he had not discussed it with Orr.

In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in dollars) per season, but he would have to pass a physical examination at the start of each season&#x27;s training camp. Only the first year&#x27;s money was guaranteed. Eagleson was quoted at the time as saying, &quot;There is only one way that Bobby Orr will ever be back with the Bruins, and that&#x27;s if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens out the whole situation. Otherwise he&#x27;s gone.&quot; Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins&#x27; general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a lie detector test. According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.

Then-Bruins head coach Don Cherry suggested that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr&#x27;s complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused to speak with the Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston&#x27;s offer. Orr&#x27;s departure from the Bruins was acrimonious and he has not held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.

Orr&#x27;s contract with Chicago, five years in length, was for US$3 million (US$ in dollars), to be paid over 30 years. Spreading out the payments in this way was done to minimize taxes. While a player, he never cashed a Chicago paycheque, stating that he was paid to play hockey and would not accept a salary if he was not playing.

===1976 Canada Cup===
After Orr signed with Chicago, the Black Hawks gave him permission to play for Team Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup tournament. Orr did not play in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, and he wanted badly to play for Canada. Orr had been unable to play in the Summit Series due to knee surgery, although he did participate as a non-player. Orr&#x27;s participation in the Canada Cup was considered ill-conceived and Eagleson later thought it may have been the &#x27;last straw&#x27; that killed his career. Orr himself said that he knew before the tournament that &quot;I knew I didn&#x27;t have much longer. That series didn&#x27;t do it. I thought I could get the next season in, but not much after that. I knew, looking at that team, I wouldn&#x27;t have to do as much. I wouldn&#x27;t have traded it for anything.&quot;

Despite his knee, Orr&#x27;s performance in the Canada Cup led to him being named to the tournament All-Star team and he was named the overall MVP for the tournament. According to teammate Bobby Clarke, Orr &quot;would hardly be able to walk on the morning of the game, and he would hardly be able to walk in the afternoon, and then, at night, he would be the best player on one of the greatest teams ever assembled. He was the best player in every game; he was the best player in the tournament. He couldn&#x27;t skate like he used to, but he could still go.&quot; According to teammate Darryl Sittler, &quot;Bobby Orr was better on one leg, than anybody else was on two.&quot;

===Retirement===
Orr signed with Chicago, but his injuries limited him to only 26 games over the next three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977–78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgical procedures, was having trouble walking and barely skated any more. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to make a comeback. He played six games of the 1978–79 season and came to the conclusion that he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit&#x27;s Olympia Stadium.

Orr retired having scored 270 goals and 645 assists for 915 points in 657 games, adding 953 penalty minutes. At the time of his retirement, he was the leading defenceman in league history in goals, assists and points, tenth overall in assists and 19th in points. , the only retired players in league history to have averaged more points per game than Orr are Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Mike Bossy, all of them forwards. &quot;Losing Bobby&quot;, said Gordie Howe, &quot;was the greatest blow the National Hockey League has ever suffered&quot;.

The Hockey Hall of Fame waived the normal three-year waiting period for induction into the Hall and he was enshrined at age 31 – the youngest player living at the time of his induction in history. Orr was the eighth player to have the three-year period waived, the next two being Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999), after which the Hall decided that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under &quot;certain humanitarian circumstances&quot;.

His number 4 jersey was retired by the Bruins on January 9, 1979. At the ceremony, the crowd at Boston Garden would not stop applauding and as a result, most of the evening&#x27;s program had to be scrapped at the last second due to the constant cheering. The crowd did not allow Orr to say his thank you speech until he put on a Bruins jersey. The day was proclaimed &quot;Bobby Orr Day&quot; in Boston and the event raised thousands of dollars for charity. He attended the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives and was given a five-minute standing ovation. Boston Celtics basketball superstar Larry Bird said in his pre-game inspiration that he always looked up at the rafters of the Garden at Orr&#x27;s retired No. 4, instead of the retired numbers of Celtics stars such as Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, or John Havlicek.

==Style of play==
When Orr and the Bruins visited cities, attendance was usually a sell-out. According to longtime Bruins coach and general manager Harry Sinden, &quot;Bobby became a star in the NHL about the time they played the National Anthem for his first game with us&quot;. Columnist Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that during the &quot;Orr years. Those Bruins were the top draw in our town every day for five seasons. They were bigger than the Red Sox or Celtics&quot;.

Orr inspired the game of hockey with his command of the two-way game. Orr&#x27;s offensive style has influenced countless defencemen who followed him.

In contrast to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr was known for his fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr&#x27;s rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins&#x27; Phil Esposito, &quot;No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if he needed to do it in the framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that&#x27;s when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to have a hand in breaking up the play.&quot; Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get from one end of the ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.

Orr&#x27;s style of play was hard on his left knee, leading to injuries and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee took all of the punishment and was operated on &quot;13 or 14&quot; times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He &#x27;protected the puck&#x27;, leading with his left knee, and holding his left arm up to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. &quot;It was the way I played,&quot; Orr has said. &quot;I liked to carry the puck and if you do that, you&#x27;re going to get hit. I wish I&#x27;d played longer, but I don&#x27;t regret it.&quot; Orr stated in 2008. &quot;I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. I tried to do things. I didn&#x27;t want to sit back. I wanted to be involved.&quot;

His right knee was basically undamaged during his career; his left knee looks like &quot;a road map of downtown Boston&quot; according to sportswriter Bob McKenzie. His left knee was used in a MasterCard commercial in 2008, his scar lines used in an animation connecting his many achievements to the year of the individual scar line. According to a 2009 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article Orr has since had two knee replacement surgeries that have left him pain-free.

Orr also had a deadly accurate shot, as Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Bernie Parent admitted &quot;If his shot is on net, it&#x27;s a goal&quot;. Orr used little to no tape on his stick. In his autobiography, &quot;Orr: My Story&quot;, he said &quot;In my case, I liked the feel of the puck on the blade without any tape at all... So the idea came to me that if I had to have tape on my stick, I would use as little as possible. Over the years, I used less and less until I was down to a single stripe. And eventually I ended up with no tape at all.&quot;

Former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden described Orr as follows: &quot;When he began to move ... the sensation was unique: All the Canadiens began backpedalling in a small panic, like beachgoers sighting a coming monster wave. He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That&#x27;s what made him so different: It felt like a five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace. He pushed his teammates, [because] you&#x27;re playing with the best player in the league and he&#x27;s giving you the puck and you just can&#x27;t mess it up. You had to be better than you&#x27;d ever been.&quot;

Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; head coach Fred Shero commented after the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals: &quot;They had Orr and he can do an awful lot. But we&#x27;ve got 17 good hockey players and every one of them put out. It was 17 against one.&quot; As the other Bruins players frequently passed the puck to Orr, and since Orr&#x27;s skating ability made it hard for an assigned checker to follow, Shero countered by having &quot;all of his [Flyers] forward lines swirl around in front of the net, usually in a crossing pattern, to serve as mobile roadblocks in Orr&#x27;s path&quot;.

Orr was also known for his mean streak. Former coach Don Cherry recounts an incident one night in Los Angeles during a game that the Bruins were losing. With a minute to go, Orr pulled one of the Bruins off the ice, left the bench and attacked a Los Angeles Kings player. Asked why, Orr said to Cherry, &quot;He was laughing at us.&quot; According to Cherry, he fought a lot. On another occasion in November 1967, Orr was clipped in the face by Toronto Maple Leaf Brian Conacher&#x27;s stick. Boston teammate Johnny McKenzie flattened Conacher from behind and started punching him. Orr, cut and bleeding, got up from the ice, pulled MacKenzie off Conacher and started punching him. Conacher, who was not fighting back, was also sucker-punched by the Bruins&#x27; Ken Hodge. Orr would be booed in Toronto from that date onwards. Orr was frequently compared to Brad Park, who played a similar style to Orr and later succeeded Orr as Boston&#x27;s top defenceman, and the two often fought each other on-ice, fuelling the bitter rivalry between the Bruins and New York Rangers. Park said, &quot;I saw no reason to be upset because I was rated second to Bobby Orr. After all, Orr not only was the top defenceman in the game, but he was considered the best player ever to put on a pair of skates. There was nothing insulting about being rated number two to such a super superstar&quot;.

==Post-hockey career==
Shortly after Orr retired, an independent accountant revealed that Orr&#x27;s liabilities exceeded his assets, leaving him essentially bankrupt despite being supposedly one of the highest-paid players in the NHL. As well, Orr&#x27;s taxes were under review. Eagleson had set up a corporation to receive Orr&#x27;s income and pay Orr a salary, but the arrangement was rejected by US and Canadian tax authorities. His assets in July 1980 totalled US$456,604 (US$ in dollars) and his tax, legal and accounting bills totalled US$469,546 (US$ in dollars). Eagleson, who had once said Orr was &#x27;fixed for life&#x27;, criticized Orr for &#x27;living beyond his means&#x27; and ignoring his investment advice. Orr split with Eagleson on April 1, 1980. As part of the legal settlement with Orr, Eagleson agreed to purchase various assets of Orr&#x27;s for US$620,000 (US$ in dollars), including his Orr–Walton Hockey Camp, which paid off US$450,000 (US$ in dollars) of Orr&#x27;s bank loans.

Orr served briefly as an assistant coach for Chicago, and as a consultant to the NHL and the Hartford Whalers. The Black Hawks balked at paying him the balance of his contract, and Orr took them to court, settling in 1983 for US$450,000 (US$ in dollars), one-third of the money they owed him. Of this, US$200,000 (US$ in dollars) went to taxes and legal fees. Orr moved back to the Boston area and formed Can-Am Enterprises with partners Tom Kelly and Paul Shanley, which built up a clientele of endorsements for Orr, including Baybank and Standard Brands. Orr did eventually restore his finances, thanks to endorsement contracts and public relations work.

Orr later played a role in the exposure of Eagleson&#x27;s misconduct over the years. He had once considered Eagleson a &quot;big brother&quot;, but broke with him in 1980 in part because he suspected that Eagleson had not been truthful with him. In addition to misleading his clients about contract terms, Eagleson fraudulently used NHLPA funds to enrich himself. Orr was one of several players who filed a formal complaint of legal misconduct against Eagleson with the Law Society of Upper Canada over Eagleson&#x27;s lending of trust monies without the consent or knowledge of his clients. In 1998, Eagleson was convicted of fraud, embezzlement and racketeering. After the conviction, Orr was one of eighteen former players who threatened to resign from the Hockey Hall of Fame if Eagleson was not removed as a builder. Facing almost certain removal, Eagleson resigned instead.

Orr was also involved in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players&#x27; pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players to give up a seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper &quot;The National&quot;. Orr: &quot;Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players&quot;. The NHL&#x27;s response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: &quot;It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game&#x27;s icons, Bobby Orr. And isn&#x27;t it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, as far as we can understand, have US$31.9 million.&quot; The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.

Orr became an agent representing hockey players in 1996. Along with investors, Orr purchased the Woolf Associates agency founded by Boston lawyer Bob Woolf. To prevent conflicts of interest, Orr sold an investment in the Lowell Lock Monsters minor pro hockey team and cut his ties with a credit card firm that had a contract with the NHLPA. Orr became a certified agent, although he would not be negotiating with hockey clubs. Player agent Rick Curran merged his agency with Orr&#x27;s in 2000. Curran and Orr along with partner Paul Krepelka incorporated the agency as Orr Hockey Group in February 2002.

The group represents such NHL players as Jeff Carter, Steve Downie, Taylor Hall, Nathan Horton, Connor McDavid, Adam McQuaid, Colton Orr (no relation), Patrick Sharp, Jason Spezza, Eric Staal, Jordan Staal, Marc Staal, and Cam Ward. Spezza, asked to comment on the experience of having Orr as an agent, replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I have a true feeling for how great he is. I have so much respect for him. I watch him on tapes and it&#x27;s just ridiculous how good he was compared to the guys he was playing against. He&#x27;s a great guy and you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s Bobby Orr, the way he talks to you.&quot;

For a number of years, Orr has coached a team of top Canadian Hockey League junior players against a similar team coached by Don Cherry in the annual CHL Top Prospects Game. Cherry, briefly his former coach in Boston, considers Orr the greatest hockey player who ever lived, noting that Orr was a complete all-around player who could skate, score, fight, and defend. , Orr&#x27;s teams have won most of the games, winning seven of the eleven times Orr has coached against Cherry. Orr&#x27;s participation was criticized as a conflict of interest while he was a player&#x27;s agent and he stopped coaching in the series. Organizers of the series convinced Orr to return to coaching in the series. He stepped down again before the 2011 game for the birth of his second grandchild. One of the teams remained named &#x27;Team Orr.&#x27;

Since retiring, Orr has performed a number of ceremonial first puck drops with the Bruins, including at the 2010 NHL Winter Classic with Bobby Clarke, between the Bruins and the Flyers. Orr performed another ceremonial puck drop on October 20, 2016, Orr along with Milt Schmidt dropped the ceremonial puck at the Boston Bruins&#x27; first home game of the season.

On November 3, 2013, Orr&#x27;s long-awaited autobiography titled &quot;&quot;, debuted at the #8 position on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list for nonfiction.

==Personal life==
While on vacation, Orr met Margaret Louise &quot;Peggy&quot; Wood, a Trenton, Michigan native and speech therapist who worked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They became engaged on Christmas Day, 1972, and married in September 1973 at a &#x27;secret&#x27; ceremony in Parry Sound. They have two sons, Darren and Brent. Darren works as a player&#x27;s agent at Orr Hockey Group. Orr&#x27;s mother Arva died in November 2000, 18 months after being diagnosed with cancer. Orr&#x27;s father Doug died in 2007. Orr became a grandfather when granddaughter Alexis was born in 2009. A second grandchild, Robert, was born in January 2011.

Orr has been known to be fiercely loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall&#x27;s drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he died at the age of 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.

Orr is also well known for his charitable works, although he kept mention of them out of the press. Former &quot;Eagle-Tribune writer&quot; Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, with a box of programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: &quot;We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn&#x27;t believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight.&quot; Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the &quot;Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award&quot; by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his &quot;numerous and unselfish contributions to society&quot;.

Among other personal interests, Orr has had a passion for fishing since childhood. He has a talent for solving jigsaw puzzles quickly. Orr is also known for his taste in clothes and style of dress. When living as a bachelor with Forristall during his years with the Bruins, Orr was also known for keeping a clean apartment and not drinking, smoking, or night-clubbing. Orr projected a clean image.

A Canadian citizen, Orr provoked extensive criticism starting in October 2020 when he took out a full-page ad in the &quot;New Hampshire Union-Leader&quot; exalting Donald Trump&#x27;s character and urging American voters to re-elect him.

==Honours==
In 1970, Orr received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1979, Orr was invested as an officer in the Order of Canada. Two buildings in his hometown of Parry Sound are named after Orr. The first is the Bobby Orr Hall of Fame, where his Order of Canada medal is on display along with other exhibits. The second is the Bobby Orr Community Centre, a multi-purpose entertainment facility. In 1995, Bobby Orr was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. Orr has been honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. In 2004, an elementary school in South Oshawa named after Orr opened. On November 27, 2008, the Oshawa Generals retired Orr&#x27;s number 2 jersey; the Generals had not issued the number since Orr transferred to the NHL in 1966. Orr thanked all who helped him in the four years he played in Oshawa: &quot;I did a lot of growing up in Oshawa from ages 14 to 18 and I&#x27;ll be forever grateful for those people who helped me in that time of my life.&quot; In February 2010, Orr was one of the eight bearers of the Olympic flag at the Opening Ceremonies of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

A bronze statue of Orr stands next to Boston&#x27;s TD Garden, the Bruins&#x27; home arena. It was unveiled on May 10, 2010, the 40th anniversary of the Bruins&#x27; first Stanley Cup victory with Orr, and depicts him immediately after scoring the winning goal. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Orr and several of his former teammates. Orr said of the statue at the ceremony, &quot;This specific moment and time we celebrate with this statue is something we can all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time we enter Boston Garden. To all of you, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I&#x27;m honoured. Guys, thank you.&quot; In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

==Career achievements==
Despite playing only twelve seasons and 657 games (of which only his first nine seasons, totalling 621 games, were full seasons), and only playing 47 NHL games after his 27th birthday, Orr accomplished many records and achievements, a number of which still stand today, and are listed below.

As of the end of the season:
* First and only defenceman to score nine hat tricks.
* Only defenceman to win the Lester B. Pearson Award.
* Only player ever to win the Norris Trophy, Art Ross Trophy, Hart Trophy, and Conn Smythe Trophy in one season (1969–70) 
* Only defenceman to win the Art Ross Trophy as league leader in scoring (1969–70, 1974–75)

<doc id="86918" wikidata="Q37776" url="?curid=86918" title="Besançon">
<text>Besançon (, ; , ; archaic ; ) is the prefecture of the department of Doubs in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. The city is located in Eastern France, close to the Jura Mountains and the border with Switzerland.

Capital of the historic and cultural region of Franche-Comté, Besançon is home to the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regional council headquarters, and is an important administrative centre in the region. It is also the seat of one of the fifteen French ecclesiastical provinces and one of the two divisions of the French Army.

In 2021 the city had a population of 120,057, in a metropolitan area of 284,474, the second in the region in terms of population.

Established in a meander of the river Doubs, the city was already important during the Gallo-Roman era under the name of &quot;Vesontio&quot;, capital of the Sequani. Its geography and specific history turned it into a military stronghold, a garrison city, a political centre, and a religious capital.

Besançon is the historical capital of watchmaking in France. This has led it to become a centre for innovative companies in the fields of microtechnology, micromechanics, and biomedical engineering. The University of Franche-Comté, founded in 1423, enrolls nearly 30,000 students each year, including around 4,000 trainees from all over the world within its Centre for Applied Linguistics (CLA).

The greenest city in France, it enjoys a quality of life recognized in Europe. Thanks to its rich historical and cultural heritage and its unique architecture, Besançon has been labeled a &quot;Town of Art and History&quot; since 1986. Its fortifications, designed by Vauban, have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The city is first recorded in 58 BC as &quot;Vesontio&quot; in Book I of Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. The etymology of &quot;Vesontio&quot; is uncertain. The most common explanation is that the name is of Celtic origin, derived from &quot;wes&quot;, meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;. During the 4th century, the letter B took the place of the V, and the city name changed to &quot;Besontio&quot; or &quot;Bisontion&quot; and then underwent several transformations to become &quot;Besançon&quot; in 1243.
===Ancient history===
The city sits within an oxbow of the river Doubs (a tributary of the Saône); a mountain closes the fourth side. During the Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, tribes of Gauls settled the oxbow.

From the 1st century BC through the modern era, the town had a significant military importance because the Alps rise abruptly to its immediate south, presenting a significant natural barrier.

The Arar (Saône) River formed part of the border between the Haedui and their hereditary rivals, the Sequani. According to Strabo, the cause of the conflict was commercial. Each tribe claimed the Arar and the tolls on trade along it. The Sequani controlled access to the Rhine and had built an oppidum (a fortified town) at Vesontio to protect their interests. The Sequani defeated and massacred the Haedui at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of the Arverni tribe and the Germanic Suebi tribe under the Germanic king Ariovistus.

Julius Caesar, in his commentaries detailing his conquest of Gaul, describes Vesontio (possibly Latinized), as the largest town of the Sequani, a smaller Gaulic tribe, and mentions that a wooden palisade surrounded it. It appears as &quot;Vesontine&quot; in the Tabula Peutingeriana.

Over the centuries, the name permutated to become Besantio, Besontion, Bisanz in Middle High German, and gradually arrived at the modern French &quot;Besançon&quot;. The locals retain their ancient heritage referring to themselves as &quot;Bisontins&quot; (feminine: &quot;Bisontine&quot;).

It has been an archbishopric since the 4th century.

===Middle Ages===

In 843, the Treaty of Verdun divided up Charlemagne&#x27;s empire. Besançon became part of Lotharingia, under the Duke of Burgundy.

As part of the Holy Roman Empire since 1034, the city became an archbishopric, and was designated the Free Imperial City of Besançon (an autonomous city-state under the Holy Roman Emperor) in 1184. In 1157, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa held the Diet of Besançon. There, Cardinal Orlando Bandinelli (the future Pope Alexander III, then adviser of Pope Adrian IV) openly asserted before the Emperor that the imperial dignity was a papal beneficium (in the more general sense of favour, not the strict feudal sense of fief), which incurred the wrath of the German princes. He would have fallen on the spot under the battle-axe of his lifelong foe, Otto of Wittelsbach, had Frederick not intervened. The Archbishops were elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1288. The close connection to the Empire is reflected in the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

In 1290, after a century of fighting against the power of the archbishops, the Emperor granted Besançon its independence.

===Renaissance===
In the 15th century, Besançon came under the influence of the dukes of Burgundy. After the marriage of Mary of Burgundy to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, the city was in effect a Habsburg fief. In 1519 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Spain, became the Holy Roman Emperor. This made him master of the Franche-Comté and Besançon, a francophone imperial city. In 1526 the city obtained the right to mint coins, which it continued to strike until 1673. Nevertheless, all coins bore the name of Charles V.

When Charles V abdicated in 1555, he gave the Franche-Comté to his son, Philip II, King of Spain. Besançon remained a free imperial city under the protection of the King of Spain. In 1598, Philip II gave the province to his daughter on her marriage to an Austrian archduke. It remained formally a portion of the Empire until its cession at the peace of Westphalia in 1648. Spain regained control of Franche-Comté and the city lost its status as a free city. Then in 1667, Louis XIV claimed the province as a consequence of his marriage to Marie-Thérèse of Spain in the War of Devolution.

Louis conquered the city for the first time in 1668, but the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned it to Spain within a matter of months. While it was in French hands, the famed military engineer Vauban visited the city and drew up plans for its fortification. The Spaniards built the main centre point of the city&#x27;s defences, &quot;la Citadelle&quot;, siting it on Mont Saint-Étienne, which closes the neck of the oxbow that is the site of the original town. In their construction, the Spaniards followed Vauban&#x27;s designs.

In 1674, French troops recaptured the city, which the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678) then awarded to France. At this time the city became the administrative centre for the Franche-Comté, with its own Parlement of Besançon, which replaced Dole.
As a result of control passing to France, Vauban returned to working on the citadel&#x27;s fortifications, and those of the city. This process lasted until 1711, some 30 years, and the walls built then surround the city. Between the train station and the central city there is a complex moat system that now serves road traffic. Numerous forts, some of which date back to that time and that incorporate Vauban&#x27;s designs elements sit on the six hills that surround the city: Fort de Trois Châtels, Fort Chaudanne, Fort du Petit Chaudanne, Fort Griffon, Fort des Justices, Fort de Beauregard and Fort de Brégille. The citadel itself has two dry moats, with an outer and inner court. In the evenings, the illuminated Citadelle stands above the city as a landmark and a testament to Vauban&#x27;s genius as a military engineer.
===Modern Europe===
In 1814, the Austrians invaded and bombarded the city. It also occupied an important position during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. In 1871, a project of Besançon Commune is engaged.

The Nazis occupied the citadel during World War II. Between 1940 and 1944, the Germans executed some one hundred French resistance fighters there. However, Besançon saw little action during the war. The allies bombed the railway complex in 1943, and the next year the Germans resisted the U.S. advance for four days.

Besançon was also the location, between 1940 and 1941, of an Internment Camp (&quot;Konzentrationslager&quot;), Frontstalag 142, also known as &quot;Caserne Vauban&quot;, which the Germans set up for 3–4,000 holders of British passports, all women and children. The conditions were harsh; many hundreds of internees died of pneumonia, diarrhea, food poisoning, dysentery, and frostbite.

In 1959, the French Army turned the citadel over to the city of Besançon, which turned it into a museum.

The forts of Brégille and Beauregard sit across the Doubs from the city. In 1913, a private company built a funicular to the Brégille Heights. The funicular passed from private ownership to the SNCF, who finally closed it in 1987. The funicular&#x27;s tracks, stations and even road signs remain in place to this day.

==Geography==

===Location===
Besançon is located in the north-east quarter of France on the river Doubs. It is about east of the national capital of Paris, east of Dijon in Burgundy, northwest of Lausanne in Switzerland, and southwest of Belfort in Franche-Comté. It is located at the edge of the Jura Mountains.

===Topography===
The city initially developed in a natural meander (or oxbow loop) of the river Doubs with a diameter of almost . The flat inner loop has an elevation of about , and is bounded to the south by a hill called &quot;Mont Saint-Étienne&quot;, which has a maximum height of . The city is surrounded by six other hills which range in elevation from : Brégille, Griffon, Planoise, Chaudanne, Montfaucon, and Montboucon. (There is a barge canal that cuts through rock under Mont Saint-Étienne, short-cutting the meander.)

===Climate===
Besançon has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Do&quot;), with cool to cold winters, warm summers, and frequent precipitation year-round. The year-round average is . The warmest month is July with an average temperature of , and the coldest is January, with an average temperature of . Besançon receives about of precipitation per year.

==Population==
As of 2022, the population of the City of Besançon was 120,057. It is the 34rd most populous city of France. Grand Besançon Métropole covers , 67 municipalities and has a population of 198,387. The metropolitan area covers , 308 municipalities and has 284,474 inhabitants. Its population increased by 4.9% between 2008 and 2020.

==Government and politics==
Until 2016, Besançon was the capital of the Franche-Comté administrative &quot;région&quot; of France, a &quot;région&quot; including the four &quot;départements&quot; of Doubs, Haute-Saône, Jura and Territoire de Belfort. Franche-Comté was since merged with the neighbouring region of Burgundy, and the &quot;préfecture&quot; was transferred to the city of Dijon. However, Besançon remains the seat of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regional council and of various decentralised administrations such as the regional offices of the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) or the Centre régional des œuvres universitaires et scolaires (Crous).

Mayor of the City of Besançon is Anne Vignot (The Ecologists).

==Economy==
The city is known for its microtechnology and watch industries. It is host of the biannual Micronora trade fair, one of Europe&#x27;s major events in the field of microtechnologies. The city has a little-known specialty, automatic ticketing machines for car parking, airports, date stamping etc.

The watch industry, for which Besançon remains the French capital, endured a major crisis in the 1970s when the advent of quartz watches from Asia knocked out the traditional watch industry in the space of just a few years. The &quot;Lip&quot; affair epitomizes the industrial crisis. LIP is to this day the name of one of Besançon&#x27;s most prestigious brands of watches. Refusing to let their factory close, the workers set up a cooperative to run it. The action produced a lot of notoriety and sympathy for the workers but also resulted in branding Besançon as a city of the radical left. It also did nothing to help revive the watch industry; the cooperative went out of business a short while later. The city took a long time to recover from the collapse of the watch industry and its other major industry of the industrial age, artificial textiles.

Since the 1980s, Besançon&#x27;s watch industry has clawed its way back on the basis of its historic reputation and quartz watches, establishing itself in a number of niche markets including customized watches, high quality watches, and fashion articles. Since the 1990s, the town has developed a reputation as one of France&#x27;s leading centres of technology in all fields, including telecommunications and biotechnology.

==Education==
Besançon is the seat of the University of Franche-Comté. , there were approximately students enrolled at the university, including around foreign students. The Institut Supérieur d&#x27;Ingénieurs de Franche-Comté (ISIFC), part of the Université de Franche-Comté, is the first school created in the country specifically for the Biomedical engineering field. The city is also home of the École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques (ENSMM), a technological school with a strong reputation in the fields of microtechnology and mechanics and the Centre for Applied Linguistics which teaches ten languages to non-native speakers (French, Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and any other known language on request. The Centre welcomes more than students every year from all over the world. As well as being famed as one of France&#x27;s finest &quot;villes d&#x27;art&quot; (art cities), Besançon is the seat of one of France&#x27;s older universities, of France&#x27;s National School of Mechanics and Micromechanics, and one of the best known French language schools in France, the CLA.

==Landmarks==
The most historic center of the town is characterised by the broad horse-shoe of the river Doubs, &quot;la Boucle&quot;, which encircles the old town. Vauban&#x27;s imposing Citadelle blocks off the neck. The historic center presents an ensemble of classic stone buildings, some dating back to the Middle Ages and others to the Spanish Renaissance.

===Gallo-Roman remains===
During Antiquity, Vesontio was an important metropolis of Roman Gaul. It is adorned with monuments, some of which have survived, archaeological excavations carried out during construction sites often revealing new discoveries dating from this period.

The most emblematic and best-preserved monument dating from this period is the Porte Noire, a Gallo-Roman triumphal arch built under Marcus Aurelius in the 2nd century in the Saint-Jean district. Heavily deteriorated by the vagaries of time and pollution, it was the subject of a long and difficult restoration operation at the beginning of the 21st century. Immediately below is the Square Castan, a garden with a collection of archaeological remains from the 2nd century or the 3rd century including in particular eight Corinthian columns.

On the other bank of the river Doubs, in the Battant district, the remains of the Vesontio arena are visible: only a few steps and foundations have been unearthed, its stones having been widely used in the Middle Ages for the construction of other buildings.

There are several domus in the residential district of Vesontio. Among them, the domus of the Palace of Justice and the domus of the Lumière college with Roman mosaic exhibited in situ at the Besançon Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology. Other remains can be seen in more anonymous places, such as the ancient foundations in the underground car park of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regional council.

=== Fortifications and military buildings ===
Most of the current fortification system (citadel, defensive wall made up of ramparts and bastions, Fort Griffon) is the work of the military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban. This group of buildings allows Besançon to appear on the UNESCO World Heritage List with eleven other sites under the title Fortifications of Vauban. The forts on the other hills were all built in the 19th century. The only remaining pre-Vauban fortifications are Porte Rivotte, Porte Taillée, Tour Carrée, Tour Notre-Dame and Tour de la Pelote.

The citadel of Besançon was built by Vauban from 1678 to 1771 and is the most visited site in Franche-Comté with more than 250,000 visitors each year. It extends over eleven hectares at the top of Mont Saint-Étienne at an altitude between 330 and 370 meters, thus overhanging the meander of the river Doubs which has an altitude between 240 and 250 meters. It brings together a museum of Resistance and Deportation, a museum of Franche-Comté traditions, the regional archeology service and a zoo. It is the symbol of the city. Fort Griffon, whose name is that of the Italian architect Jean Griffoni who was commissioned to build a first fortification at this location in 1595, is a second citadel. It was Vauban who, at the end of the 17th century, had the current fort built.

The city walls designed by Vauban includes all the fortifications of La Boucle historic district which were rebuilt from 1675 to 1695. Vauban in fact replaced the medieval defenses restored and completed by Charles V in the sixteenth century with a belt provided with six bastioned battery towers : the Notre-Dame tower, the bastioned tower of Chamars, the bastioned tower of the Marais, the bastioned tower of the Cordeliers (completed in 1691), the bastioned tower of Bregille and the bastioned tower of Rivotte.

Fortifications prior to the French conquest are also numerous. The Tour de la Pelote, located on the Quai de Strasbourg, is a defensive tower built in 1546 by the municipal government on the orders of Charles V. Its name would come from the former owner of the land where it was built, Pierre Pillot, lord of Chenecey. The Porte Rivotte is a city gate dating from the 16th century, consisting of two round towers and a pediment carved with a sun which was King Louis XIV&#x27;s personal emblem. The Porte Taillée (&quot;Carved Gate&quot;), opened in a rocky outcrop, is the work of the Romans. It marks the entrance to the city on the road to Switzerland. It is surmounted by a guardhouse and a watchtower built in 1546. The “square tower”, located in the promenade des Glacis, is also called the Montmart tower. It was built in the 13th century to defend the old entrance to the Battant district.

The fortifications of the 19th century consist of a set of forts covering all the heights of the city: the fort of Chaudanne built from 1837 to 1842, the fort of Bregille built from 1820 to 1832, the fort of Planoise built from 1877 to 1880, Fort Benoit was built from 1877 to 1880, Fort Beauregard in 1830.

Another example are the Trois-Châtels and Tousey lunettes, both built at the end of the 18th and early 19th centuries, as well as the Rosemont battery built during the war of 1870–1871, the Fort des Montboucons built from 1877 to 1880 and the Fort des Justices built from 1870. A third Lunette d&#x27;Arçon was located on the site of Fort Chaudanne; only its tower was preserved during the construction of the fort in the first half of the 19th century.

The Ruty barracks, formerly Saint-Paul barracks, are made up of four pavilions surrounding a courtyard serving as a Place d&#x27;Armes and dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. It currently houses the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division and the 7th Armoured Brigade.

=== Places of worship ===
After the city acquired an episcopal see in the 3rd century, churches and abbeys multiplied during the period of the High Middle Ages. Important constructions or reconstructions of religious buildings then took place in the 11th century during the episcopate of Hugues Ier de Salins and many churches were embellished or rebuilt after the French conquest of 1674. In 1842, the Church of the Holy Spirit was officially ceded to the Protestant community while the Jewish community inaugurated its synagogue in 1869. Finally, the Muslim community had two mosques built at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.

The most important religious building dedicated to Catholic worship in Besançon is Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral, of Gothic architecture, dating from the 9th, 12th and 18th centuries. It has two apses and contains a masterpiece by Fra Bartolomeo, the painting of the &quot;Madonna in Glory with Saints&quot; painted in 1512. The cathedral dominates the old chapter district which includes the Archbishopric of Besançon located in the former Hôtel Boistouset and the former Archbishop&#x27;s Palace currently occupied by the Rectorate of the academy. The Grand Seminary was built from 1670 to 1695 by Archbishop Antoine-Pierre Ier de Grammont and completed in the 18th century by the elevation of the portal and the construction of the main facade. The chapel has a two-storey facade of Corinthian pilasters on the street. Its portal is surmounted by a tympanum where the sculptor Huguenin represented a Madonna and Child in 1848.

At the other end of the old cardo and current Grande Rue, is the Sainte-Madeleine church built from 1746 to 1766 on plans by Nicolas Nicole. It was definitively completed in 1828–1830 with the construction of its two towers, one of which hosts the Jacquemart bellstriker automaton. Its roof is made of polychrome glazed tiles.

In the heart of the city centre, St Peter&#x27;s Church, built by the Bisontin Claude Joseph Alexandre Bertrand from 1782 to 1786, impresses with the height of its bell tower which served as a belfry for the Hôtel de Ville, which is opposite. St Maurice&#x27;s Church, founded in the 6th century, was rebuilt from 1711 to 1714 with a Jesuit-style facade surmounted by a carillon. Notre-Dame Church corresponds to the former Benedictine abbey of Saint-Vincent which was founded in the eleventh century. It was under the Empire that it became the parish church of Notre-Dame. Its facade was designed in 1720 by the architect Jean-Pierre Galezot. You can still make out the large entrance gate to the abbey and the 16th-century bell tower. Today it is occupied by the Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences. Saint-François-Xavier Church, former chapel of the Jesuit college, was built between 1680 and 1688. Its plan is in the shape of a Latin cross surrounded by small side chapels. It was decommissioned in 1975. The Saint-Paul abbey, church of the former abbey founded around 628 by Saint Donat, archbishop of Besançon, was rebuilt in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Notre-Dame-du-Foyer chapel, built from 1739 to 1745 by the Bisontin Nicolas Nicole, was once the chapel of the Couvent du Refuge before being attached to the Saint-Jacques hospital in 1802.

Outside the old town, among the important Catholic buildings, is the Saint-Ferjeux basilica of Romano-Byzantine style built on the cave of the patron saints of Besançon, Saint Ferjeux and Saint Ferréol. Notre-Dame des Buis, a 19th-century chapel, overlooks the city at an altitude of 491 metres.

The Protestant community was assigned in 1842 the former hospice of the Holy Spirit, today the temple of the Holy Spirit. It is a 13th-century Gothic building augmented by a 15th-century chapel and deprived of its bell tower during the Revolution. It is distinguished by its gallery of sculpted wood, a masterpiece by an anonymous artist. Its neo-Gothic portal was created in 1841 by the architect Alphonse Delacroix in place of the old porch.

The Jewish community, booming in the city in the middle of the 19th century, built the synagogue of Besançon from 1869 to 1871 on plans by the architect Pierre Marnotte. Listed as a historic monument in 1984, it is particularly remarkable for its Moorish style inspired by the Alhambra in Granada.

The most recently built places of worship in Besançon are of Muslim faith: the Sounna Mosque built at the end of the 20th century on land ceded by the city in the Saint-Claude district, and the Al-Fath located in the district of Planoise.

=== Government and residentials buildings ===
In the 16th century, many palaces and mansions were erected in the Boucle and Battant districts. The most important is the Palais Granvelle with Renaissance architecture built for Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, Chancellor and Keeper of the Seals of Emperor Charles V. It now houses the Museum of Time. The Hôtel de Ville (city hall) was built by the architect Richard Maire who completed it in 1573. It has an ashlar façade in the spirit of Italian Renaissance palaces. Until the Revolution, a large niche in the façade housed a bronze statue of Charles V riding a two-headed eagle.

The Palais de Justice (Court of Appeal) was originally the second main building to the Hôtel de Ville. The construction was entrusted to the architect Hugues Sambin who was greatly inspired by the spirit of the Renaissance. The Hôtel de Champagney was built in the Battant district by Jacques Bonvalot, Lord of Champagney, during the first half of the 16th century. His daughter Nicole Bonvalot, widow of Nicolas de Granvelle, had the premises redesigned and the courtyard designed from 1560 to 1565 by architect Richard Maire. It is distinguished by the four gargoyles that adorn its facade and by its interior courtyard with arched passageways and galleries with wooden columns. The Hôtel Mareschal belonged to an important Besançon family, the Mareschal family. Burnt down on 4 June 1516, Guillaume Mareschal had it rebuilt in 1532 with an ornamental flora that heralded the Renaissance. Other notable buildings dating from the sixteenth century are the Hôtels of Chevanney, Gauthiot d&#x27;Ancier, Anvers, Bonvalot, and Bouteiller. At that time, the hills around Besançon were covered with vineyards: the city has preserved from this important viticultural past a dozen &quot;cabordes&quot;, former vineyard huts made of dry limestone.

Immediately after the French conquest, the installations were mainly of a military nature. However, two other notable constructions were erected at the end of the 17th century. Work on the Saint-Jacques hospital, which was intended to replace the one located on rue d&#x27;Arènes, began in 1688 and was completed in 1701. Its monumental entrance gate, executed by the locksmith Nicolas Chapuis in 1703 has been replaced by a copy. The Vauban Quay was built from 1691 to 1695 by the engineer Isaac Robelin. It is a monumental set of houses with arcades.

During the Age of Enlightenment, the town&#x27;s urban planning underwent major transformations and the construction of remarkable buildings, notably due to its new status as capital. The Hôtel de l&#x27;Intendance, currently prefecture of the Doubs departement, was built from 1771 to 1778 at the request of the intendant Charles André de Lacoré. The plans were drawn up by the great Parisian architect Victor Louis and the work directed by the bisontin architect Nicolas Nicole. It adopts the traditional plan of private mansions, with a main courtyard with a facade made up of six Ionic columns surmounted by a pediment and a garden at the rear of the building whose facade is decorated with a rotunda jutting out slightly. on the garden. The Théâtre Ledoux is an order from Monsieur de Lacoré to Claude-Nicolas Ledoux who drew up the plans and entrusted the construction to Claude-Joseph-Alexandre Bertrand which began in 1778 and ended with its inauguration on 9 August 1784 under the crook of Louis V Joseph of Bourbon-Condé. With a capacity of 2,000 seats, it was considered very innovative, as it had a seated parterre, an amphitheater hall without boxes, and it was the first in the world to have an orchestra pit. On 29 April 1958 a dramatic fire completely destroyed the interior and the roof of the building. The walls are the only witnesses that have survived, including the facade and its six monumental columns. Many mansions also attest to the prosperity of the city during this period. The Hotel Terrier de Santans was built between 1770 and 1772 for the Marquis Terrier de Santans, first president of parliament, by the architect Claude Bertrand. Other eminent families call on the greatest architects for their homes: the Hôtels Petit de Marivat, de Magnoncourt, Boistouset, de Courbouzon, de Clévans, de Camus, Querret, Terrier, and de Rosières.

If the thermal baths of Besançon were completely destroyed in the 1950s, the city retains a number of buildings emblematic of its thermal past: the Grand Hôtel des Bains inaugurated in 1893, the municipal casino installed in a Belle Époque-style building inaugurated in 1882 or the Kursaal opened in 1893. It was also during this period that the astronomical observatory and the Café du Commerce were erected, a brasserie from the second half of the 19th century with a rich interior decor in the Belle Époque style.

Besançon&#x27;s specialization in watchmaking has also left its mark on the city&#x27;s heritage. The astronomical clock located inside St. John&#x27;s cathedral was commissioned in 1858 by Cardinal Mathieu from Auguste-Lucien Vérité. Composed of 30,000 mechanical parts, 57 dials and presenting 122 all interdependent indications, it is considered a masterpiece of its kind and classified as a Historic Monument in 1991. The National School of Watchmaking was built from 1928 to 1932 by the architect Paul Guadet. This imposing Art Deco building with a monumental clock on its facade now houses the Lycée Jules-Haag. The Dodane watch factory, completed in 1943, is an L-shaped reinforced concrete building whose construction was entrusted to the architect Auguste Perret who also designed the interior decor elements. It has a private garden with swimming pool and tennis court. In the twenty-first century, two monumental clocks, works by Bisontin Philippe Lebru from the Utinam workshop, were installed on the facade of the Besançon Museum of Fine Arts and inside the Besançon Franche-Comté TGV station.

In addition to the watchmaking heritage, other buildings with notable architecture were built during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The Canot university campus was built from 1929 by the architect René Tournier and inaugurated by the President of the Republic Albert Lebrun in 1933. It was the first university residence in France. The Higher Institute of Fine Arts was built between 1970 and 1974 to plans by the Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert. The Cité des Arts inaugurated in 2013 is the work of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma.

===Parks and gardens===
With of urban open spaces, including of forests, Besançon is considered the first green city in France with 204 m2 of green spaces per capita. The Forest of Chailluz, covering , represents a quarter of the total area of the commune. The city is the owner of this mainly deciduous forest, which includes a wildlife park and a fitness trail in addition to numerous trails. The historic center is entirely surrounded by green spaces. To the west of the old town, on the left bank of the Doubs, are the Jardins de la Gare-d&#x27;Eau: in 1833, the construction of the Rhone-Rhine Canal led the city to create a small port river shipping but it quickly fell into disuse after the opening of a canal tunnel under the citadel. The park around the basin is currently owned by the departmental council of Doubs. The Chamars Promenade, attached to these gardens but further north, built in the fourth quarter of the eighteenth century, owes its name to the contraction of Champ de Mars (Field of Mars). It was at first a marshland separated into two parts by an arm of the River Doubs: the big and the small Chamars. Vauban, judging this place vulnerable, fortified it with the help of ramparts and bastions. The city obtained permission to turn this space into a promenade in 1739. The architect Bertrand remodeled it between 1770 and 1778 by incorporating a café, public baths, an aviary of rare birds, waterfalls, a botanical garden and many plantings. It largely disappeared after 1830 with the leveling of the inner rampart and the creation of the Gare d&#x27;Eau port. A public garden was refurbished between 1978 and 1982. The only surviving elements of the former Chamars Promenade are the two guard houses, some plane trees, and the stone vases of the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Boutry.

North of the historic district of Battant, on the right bank of the River Doubs, the Glacis Promenade, created in the middle of the nineteenth century, is the work of the landscape architect Brice Michel and the architect Boutterin. Right in the heart of this district, the Clos Barbisier is a garden created in 1988 and presenting an important variety of roses. The green belt extends east of the old town, still on the right bank of the River Doubs, by the Promenade of Helvetia which houses a botanical garden called Jardin des Sens et des Senteurs (Garden of Senses and Scents) realized in 1987, accessible to the visually impaired thanks to its plants and shrubs with certain sensory features (smell, touch), and Braille signs. Directly to the south is the Micaud Promenade, which has been progressively developed over from 1843 on plans by architect Alphonse Delacroix. It is named after Jules Micaud, the mayor who promoted the project. It includes more than four hundred trees, including a southern magnolia and a European beech, a bandstand, a pond, and several sculptures. The Jardins du Casino, a public garden with flowering lawns and tree-lined avenues, is directly on the other side of Edouard Droz Avenue, which runs along Micaud Promenade.
In the heart of the historic center, the Promenade Granvelle is the former private garden of the sixteenth century Granvelle Palace, which the municipality acquired in 1712 and which was opened to the public in 1728. The architect Bertrand redeveloped it into a public garden from 1775 to 1778. It includes a bandstand, an artificial cave, a Wallace fountain, statues of Victor Hugo and Auguste Veil-Picard, the portal of the church of the convent of the Great Carmelites, and a neoclassical colonnade, a remnant of a refreshment pavilion. The first botanical garden in Besançon was created in 1580. It then occupied more than ten different sites, including the current location of Place Leclerc since 1957. The Parc de l&#x27;Observatoire, created in 1904 at the request of the director of the astronomical observatory Auguste Lebeuf, is home to a purple beech, a weeping beech, chestnut and pine trees.

A statue of Henri Bouchot stands in Besançon&#x27;s Henri-Bouchot square. It was originally in bronze but was melted down by the Vichy régime. The replacement in stone was made by Georges Saupique.

==Culture==

===Museums and galleries===

There are five museums in Besançon that all bear the designation &quot;Museum of France&quot;. Besançon has one of the finest city art galleries in France outside Paris. The Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology, created in 1694, was the first museum created in France and predates The Louvre by almost a century. It has benefited from a remarkable series of bequests over time.

In the 1960s the architect Luis Miquel, a pupil of Le Corbusier, totally rebuilt the building. The building&#x27;s interior takes the form of a gently rising concrete walkway that takes visitors up from classical antiquity to the modern age. Among the museum&#x27;s treasures are a fine collection of classical antiquities and ancient Egyptian artifacts, as well as a very rich collection of paintings including works by Bellini, Bronzino, Tintoretto, Titian, Rubens, Jordaens, Ruisdael, Cranach, Zurbarán, Goya, Philippe de Champaigne, Fragonard, Boucher, David, Ingres, Géricault, Courbet, Constable, Bonnard, Matisse, Picasso and many others.

The Musée du Temps (Museum of Time), inaugurated in 2002, was formerly the City&#x27;s History Museum. Located in the Granvelle Palace, its concept is unique in Europe, grouping watch collections (watches, sundials, hourglasses, all means of measuring time ...) and the funds of the history museum (paintings, engravings). In addition, three museums are grouped inside the Vauban citadel.

The Museum of Resistance and Deportation has been open since 1971 and is one of the largest in its category at the national level. It consists of twenty rooms, retracing the themes related to the Second World War (Nazism, the Occupation, the Vichy regime, the Resistance, Liberation, Deportation) through photographs, texts, documents and original collectibles. The establishment also has two rooms dedicated to artists whose works were made in concentration camps.

The Comtois Museum, installed in 1961 in the Royal Front, presents regional arts and traditions through sixteen permanent exhibition halls with collections of more than 20,000 objects, mainly from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The Museum of Natural History, created in 1959 under the leadership of Mayor Jean Minjoz, presents varied backgrounds in a small evolutionary course around collections of natural sciences (naturalized animals, herbaria ...); it also presents live animals in four sectors (zoo, insectarium, noctarium and aquarium). Besançon is also home to the birthplace of Victor Hugo, presenting the humanist political commitment of the writer. The Cité des Arts exhibits part of the works of the regional fund of contemporary art of Franche-Comté.

===Performing arts centers===
The city is home to a National Center for Dramatic Art, the Centre dramatique national Besançon Franche-Comté created in 1972. This theater installed in the former ballroom of the Casino has a capacity of 337 seats. The Scène nationale de Besançon performs since 2012 in two facilities including the Théâtre de l&#x27;Espace and the Théâtre Ledoux. The Théâtre Ledoux was inaugurated in 1784 and can accommodate 1100 people. Besançon also has smaller structures. The Scénacle located in the Saint-Jean district is a small theater with a capacity of about 100 seats that offers plays and concerts by the troupe or regional artists. On campus, the 150-seat Petit Théâtre de la Bouloie welcomes student projects to promote artistic and cultural practice (university theater, university choir...), artistic residencies of young companies, professional shows proposed by the partner structures and shows of young companies.

The Kursaal is the result of the will to offer entertainment and shows to spa guests of the spa resort of Besançon-les-Bains created in 1891 and military garrison in the city. The Kursaal-Circus opened at the end of 1893, but the promoter&#x27;s finances, Madame Veuve Pellegrin, did not allow her to reimburse the expenses incurred. The city acquired it in 1895 and the Kursaal became the city&#x27;s concert hall. It closes in 1970 for reasons of obsolescence, before being renovated from 1979 and reopened in September 1982. A conference room with 360 seats, called Petit Kursaal was also created in the basement. The main hall, known as Grand Kursaal, has two balconies and a dome ceiling decorated with frescoes reminiscent of the circus arts. Its capacity can go up to 1,038 seats including 450 on both balconies.

Bands play throughout the year at La Rodia, located in the Prés-de-Vaux neighborhood. It includes a large 900-seat theater and a 330-seat &quot;club&quot; hall as well as two creative studios. The Micropolis Exhibition Center houses a modular hall with a capacity of 2,200 to 6,500 seats, where the majority of artists and bands on national and international tours are performing.

==Literary references==
* Julius Caesar, in his account &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; gives a description of the antique city of Besançon, named Vesontio (first book, section 38):

[1.38] When he had proceeded three days&#x27; journey, word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on Vesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced three days&#x27; journey from its territories. Caesar thought that he ought to take the greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was in that town a most ample supply of every thing which was serviceable for war; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground, as to afford a great facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs almost surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with a pair of compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining space, which is not more than , where the river leaves a gap, in such a manner that the roots of that mountain extend to the river&#x27;s bank on either side. A wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this [mountain], and connects it with the town.

* Gary Jennings&#x27;s novel &quot;Raptor&quot;, which takes place in the 5th century AD, describes Vesontio lavishly.
* In Stendhal&#x27;s novel &quot;Le rouge et le noir&quot;, Julien Sorel, the main character, studies for a while at the Catholic seminary at Besançon (first book, chapters 24 to 30):

Eventually he saw the white walls beyond the distant mountain; it was the citadel of Besançon. &quot;What a difference&quot;, he said, sighing, &quot;if I could come into this fine city as a sub-lieutenant of one of these regiments of the post.&quot; Besançon is not only one of the prettiest cities in France, but it abounds in brave and intelligent men. Julien, however, was only a little peasant, without any means of approaching distinguished personages.

* In the poem &quot;This Century Was Two Years Old&quot; (&quot;Les Feuilles d&#x27;automne&quot;; literally – &quot;The Leaves of Autumn&quot;), Victor Hugo evokes his birth in Besançon:

&lt;poem&gt;This century was two years old. Rome was replacing Sparta;
Already Napoleon was emerging from under Bonaparte.
And already the First Consul&#x27;s tight mask
Had been split in several places by the Emperor&#x27;s brow.
It was then that in Besançon, that old Spanish town,
Cast like a seed into the flying wind,
A child was born of mixed blood—Breton and Lorraine—
Pallid, blind and mute...
That child, whom Life was scratching from its book,
And who had not another day to live,
Was me.&lt;/poem&gt;

* Julian Barnes&#x27;s novel &quot;A History of the World in Chapters&quot; features as chapter 3: &quot;Wars of Religion&quot;—a fictional manuscript reportedly from the Archives Municipales de Besançon.
* Balzac&#x27;s novel &quot;Albert Savaron&quot; takes place in Besançon.
* Colonel Sainte-Hermine, the fictional hero of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Last Cavalier&quot;, is a native of Besançon.
The Christmas carol &quot;Berger, Secoue Ton Sommeil Profond&quot;, known in English as &quot;Shepherds, Shake Off Your Drowsy Sleep&quot;, originated in Besançon in the 17th century.

<text>René of Anjou (; ; 16 January 1409 – 10 July 1480) was Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence from 1434 to 1480, who also reigned as King of Naples from 1435 to 1442 (then deposed). Having spent his last years in Aix-en-Provence, he is known in France as the Good King René (; ).

René was a member of the House of Valois-Anjou, a cadet branch of the French royal house, and the great-grandson of John II of France. He was a prince of the blood, and for most of his adult life also the brother-in-law of the reigning king Charles VII of France. Other than the aforementioned titles, he was also Duke of Bar from the 1420s onwards and Duke of Lorraine from 1431 to 1453.

==Biography==

René was born on 16 January 1409 in the castle of Angers. He was the second son of Duke Louis II of Anjou, King of Naples, by Yolanda of Aragon. René was the brother of Marie of Anjou, who married the future Charles VII and became Queen of France.

Louis II died in 1417 and his sons, together with their brother-in-law Charles, were brought up under the guardianship of their mother. The elder son, Louis III, succeeded to the crown of Sicily and the Duchy of Anjou; René then became Count of Guise. In 1419, when René was only ten, he was legally married to Isabella, elder daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine.

René, then only ten, was to be brought up in Lorraine under the guardianship of Charles II and Louis, cardinal of Bar, both of whom were attached to the Burgundian party, but he retained the right to bear the arms of Anjou. He was far from sympathizing with the Burgundians. Joining the French army at Reims in 1429, he was present at the consecration of Charles VII. When Louis of Bar died in 1430, René inherited the duchy of Bar. The next year, on his father-in-law&#x27;s death, he succeeded to the duchy of Lorraine. The inheritance was contested by the heir-male, Antoine de Vaudemont, who with Burgundian help defeated René at Bulgneville in July 1431. The Duchess Isabella effected a truce with Antoine, but the duke remained a prisoner of the Burgundians until April 1432, when he recovered his liberty on parole on yielding up as hostages his two sons, John and Louis.

René&#x27;s title as duke of Lorraine was confirmed by his suzerain, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, at Basel in 1434. This proceeding roused the anger of the Burgundian duke, Philip the Good, who required him early in the next year to return to his prison, from which he was released two years later on payment of a heavy ransom. At the death of his brother Louis III in 1435, he succeeded to the Duchy of Anjou and County of Maine. The marriage of Marie of Bourbon, niece of Philip of Burgundy, with John, Duke of Calabria, René&#x27;s eldest son, cemented peace between the two families.

Joanna II, queen of Naples, had chosen Louis III as her presumptive heir and upon Louis&#x27; death offered it to René to inherit her kingdom after her death. After appointing a regency in Bar and Lorraine, he set sail for Naples in 1438.

Naples, however, was also claimed by Alfonso V of Aragon, who had been first adopted and then repudiated by Joanna II. In 1441 Alfonso laid a six-month siege to Naples. René returned to France in 1442, and though he retained the title of king of Naples his effective rule was never recovered. Later efforts to recover his rights in Italy failed. His mother Yolande, who had governed Anjou in his absence, died in 1442.

René took part in the negotiations with the English at Tours in 1444, and peace was consolidated by the marriage of his younger daughter, Margaret, with Henry VI of England at Nancy.

René now made over the government of Lorraine to his son John, who was, however, only formally installed as Duke of Lorraine on the death of Queen Isabella in 1453. René had the confidence of Charles VII, and is said to have initiated the reduction of the men-at-arms set on foot by the king, with whose military operations against the English he was closely associated. He entered Rouen with him in November 1449.

After his second marriage with Jeanne de Laval, daughter of Guy of Laval and Isabella of Brittany, René took a less active part in public affairs, devoting himself to composing poetry and painting miniatures, gardening and raising animals. The fortunes of his house declined in his old age: in 1466, the rebellious Catalans offered the crown of Aragon to René. His son John, unsuccessful in Italy, was sent to take up the conquest of that kingdom but died —apparently by poison— at Barcelona on 16 December 1470. John&#x27;s eldest son Nicholas perished in 1473, also under suspicion of poisoning. In 1471, René&#x27;s daughter Margaret was finally defeated in the Wars of the Roses. Her husband and her son were killed and she herself became a prisoner who had to be ransomed by Louis XI in 1476.

René retired to Aix-en-Provence and in 1474 made a will by which he left Bar to his grandson René II, Duke of Lorraine; and Anjou and Provence to his nephew Charles, count of Le Maine. King Louis XI seized Anjou and Bar, and two years later sought to compel René to exchange the two duchies for a pension. The offer was rejected, but further negotiations assured the lapse to the crown of the duchy of Anjou and the annexation of Provence was only postponed until the death of the Count of Le Maine. René died on 10 July 1480 at Aix, but was buried in the Angers Cathedral, Angers. In the 19th century, historians bestowed on him the epithet &quot;the good&quot;.

He founded an order of chivalry, the &quot;Ordre du Croissant&quot;, which preceded the royal foundation of St Michael but did not survive René.

==Arts==
The King of Sicily&#x27;s fame as an amateur painter formerly led to the optimistic attribution to him of many paintings in Anjou and Provence, in many cases simply because they bore his arms. These works are generally in the Early Netherlandish style, and were probably executed under his patronage and direction, so that he may be said to have formed a school of the fine arts in sculpture, painting, goldsmith&#x27;s work and tapestry. He employed Barthélemy d&#x27;Eyck as both painter and &quot;varlet de chambre&quot; for most of his career.

Two of the most famous works formerly attributed to René are the triptych of the &quot;Burning Bush&quot; of Nicolas Froment of Avignon in Aix Cathedral, showing portraits of René and his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, and two illuminated Book of Hours in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the British Library. Among the men of letters attached to his court was Antoine de la Sale, whom he made tutor to his son John. He encouraged the performance of mystery plays; on the performance of a mystery of the Passion at Saumur in 1462 he remitted four years of taxes to the town, and the representations of the Passion at Angers were carried out under his auspices.
He exchanged verses with his kinsman, the poet Charles of Orléans. René was also the author of two allegorical works: a devotional dialogue, &quot;Le Mortifiement de vaine plaisance&quot; (&quot;The Mortification of Vain Pleasure,&quot; 1455), and a love quest, &quot;Le Livre du Cuer d&#x27;amours espris&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Love-Smitten Heart,&quot; 1457). The latter fuses the conventions of Arthurian romance with an allegory of love based on the &quot;Romance of the Rose. &quot; Both works were exquisitely illustrated by his court painter, Barthélémy d&#x27;Eyck. &quot;Le Mortifiement&quot; survives in eight illuminated manuscripts. Although Barthélémy&#x27;s original is lost, the extant manuscripts include copies of his miniatures by Jean le Tavernier, Jean Colombe, and others. René is sometimes credited with the pastoral poem &quot;Regnault and Jeanneton&quot;, but this was more likely a gift to the king honoring his marriage to Jeanne de Laval.

King René&#x27;s Tournament Book (&#x27; or &#x27;; ) describes rules of a tournament. The most famous and earliest of the many manuscript copies is kept in the French National Library. This is—unusually for a deluxe manuscript—on paper and painted in watercolor. It may represent drawings by Barthélemy d&#x27;Eyck, intended as preparatory only, which were later illuminated by him or another artist. There are twenty-six full and double page miniatures. The description given in the book is different from that of the pas d&#x27;armes held at Razilly and Saumur; conspicuously absent are the allegorical and chivalresque ornamentations that were in vogue at the time. René instead emphasizes he is reporting on ancient tournament customs of France, Germany and the Low Countries, combining them in a new suggestion on how to hold a tournament. The tournament described is a melee fought by two sides. Individual jousts are only briefly mentioned.

As a patron, René commissioned translations and retranslations of classical works into French prose. These include Strabo, which Guarino da Verona completed in 1458; and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by an unknown translator, completed in 1467.

Rene also kept a theater troupe at his court, led by a jester and playwright Triboulet. The duke rewarded Triboulet generously for his talents.

==Marriages and issue==

René married:
# Isabelle, Duchess of Lorraine (1400 – 28 February 1453) on 24 October 1420
# Jeanne de Laval, on 10 September 1454, at the Abbey of St. Nicholas in Angers

His legitimate children by Isabelle were:

# Louis (16 October 1427 – between 22 May and 16 October 1444), Marquis of Pont-à-Mousson and &quot;Lieutenant General of Lorraine&quot;. At the age of five, in 1432, he was sent as a hostage to Dijon with his brother John in exchange for their captive father. John was released, but Louis was not and died of pneumonia in prison.

==Cultural references==

He appears as &quot;Reignier&quot; in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VI, part 1&quot;. His alleged poverty for a king is satirised. He pretends to be the Dauphin to deceive Joan of Arc, but she sees through him. She later claims to be pregnant with his child.

René&#x27;s honeymoon, devoted with his bride to the arts, is imagined in Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Anne of Geierstein&quot; (1829). The imaginary scene of his honeymoon was later depicted by the Pre-Raphaelite painters Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

In 1845 the Danish poet Henrik Hertz wrote the play &quot;King René&#x27;s Daughter&quot; about René and his daughter Yolande de Bar; this was later adapted into the opera &quot;Iolanta&quot; by Tchaikovsky.

René and his Order of the Crescent were adopted as &quot;historical founders&quot; by the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity in 1912, as exemplars of Christian chivalry and charity. Ceremonies of the Order of the Crescent were referenced in formulating ceremonies for the fraternity.

In conspiracy theories, such as the one promoted in &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, René has been alleged to be the ninth Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.

&quot;La Cheminée du roi René&quot; (&quot;The Fireplace of King René&quot;), op. 205, is a suite for wind quintet, composed in 1941 by Darius Milhaud.

&quot;Chant du Roi René&quot; (&quot;Song of King René&quot;) is a piece for organ (or harmonium) by Alexandre Guilmant (1837–1911) from his collection of &quot;Noels (Op.60)&quot;. The theme used throughout this piece was alleged to have been written by René (Guilmant&#x27;s source was Alphonse Pellet, organist at Nîmes Cathedral).

== Arms ==
René frequently changed his coat of arms, which represented his numerous and fluctuating claims to titles, both actual and nominal.
The Coat of arms of René in 1420; Composing the arms of the House of Valois-Anjou (top left and bottom right), Duchy of Bar (top right and bottom left), and of the Duchy of Lorraine (superimposed shield). In 1434 were added Hungary, Kingdom of Naples and Jerusalem. The arms of the Crown of Aragon were shown from 1443 to 1470. In 1453 the arms of Lorraine were removed and in 1470 Valois-Anjou were substituted for the modern arms of the duchy (superimposed shield).

<text>Frederick Martin MacMurray (August 30, 1908 – November 5, 1991) was an American actor. He appeared in more than one hundred films and a successful television series in a career that spanned nearly a half-century. His career as a major film leading man began in 1935, but his most renowned role was in Billy Wilder&#x27;s film noir &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. From 1959 to 1973, MacMurray appeared in numerous Disney films, including &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot;, and &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;. He starred as Steve Douglas in the television series &quot;My Three Sons&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Frederick Martin MacMurray was born on August 30, 1908, in Kankakee, Illinois, the son of Maleta (&quot;née&quot; Martin) and concert violinist Frederick Talmadge MacMurray, both natives of Wisconsin. His aunt, Fay Holderness, was a vaudeville performer and actress. When MacMurray was an infant, his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where his father taught music. They relocated within the state to Beaver Dam, his mother&#x27;s birthplace.

MacMurray attended school in Quincy, Illinois, where he played football and baseball, ran on the track team and worked in a local pea cannery. After graduation, he received a full scholarship to Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He played the saxophone in numerous local bands, having picked up the instrument when he was looking to fill his spare time. He continued to play saxophone while attending the Chicago Art Institute in the evenings.

==Career==
=== Acting ===
In 1928, MacMurray chauffeured his mother to Los Angeles for her health and to visit family. While there he found work as an extra and continued playing the saxophone with the California Collegians, a vaudeville group that was formed out of the pit orchestra at the Warner Brothers Hollywood Theatre. His extra work was earning him $10 a day. The band was hired to appear on Broadway in &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1930–31) with Fred Allen, Clifton Webb and Libby Holman, resulting in a move to New York City from California. MacMurray was offered a role in the production, leading to a further casting in the musical &quot;Roberta&quot; alongside Sydney Greenstreet and Bob Hope (1933–34). MacMurray signed with Paramount Pictures in 1934.

=== Stardom ===

In the 1930s, MacMurray worked with film directors Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges, and actors Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, and in seven films, Claudette Colbert, beginning with &quot;The Gilded Lily&quot;. He co-starred with Katharine Hepburn in &quot;Alice Adams&quot;, with Joan Crawford in &quot;Above Suspicion&quot;, and with Carole Lombard in four productions: &quot;Hands Across the Table&quot;, &quot;The Princess Comes Across&quot;, &quot;Swing High, Swing Low&quot; and &quot;True Confession&quot;. Usually cast in light comedies as a decent, thoughtful character (&quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;), and in melodramas and musicals, MacMurray became one of the film industry&#x27;s highest-paid actors of the period. In 1943, his annual salary had reached $420,000, making him the highest-paid actor in Hollywood and the fourth-highest-paid person in the nation.

MacMurray did not serve in the military during the Second World War, instead working to sell war bonds and as an air-raid warden in his Brentwood neighborhood. The movies that he did produce during this period were mostly considered to be &quot;morale-boosters&quot; rather than outright &quot;war pictures&quot; that some of his contemporaries were churning out. In 1944, his earnings increased to $439,000, making him again the highest-paid actor.

During the production of the 1947 film &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, the hens appearing in the movie laid over 300 eggs. MacMurray and costar Claudette Colbert autographed one egg each in fifty cartons. The eggs were sold at a local farmers market and profits were donated to the Braille Institute of America.

Having starred in many episodes of Lux Radio Theatre in the late 1930s and 1940s, MacMurray returned to the medium in 1952. He featured in &quot;Bright Star,&quot; along with Irene Dunne, in which he portrayed a reporter for a local newspaper.

Despite being typecast as a &quot;nice guy&quot;, MacMurray often said his best roles were when he was cast against type, such as under the direction of Billy Wilder and Edward Dmytryk. Perhaps his best known &quot;bad guy&quot; performance was that of Walter Neff, an insurance salesman who plots with a greedy wife to kill her husband in the film noir classic &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. MacMurray stated in 1956 that this was his favorite role, and that it &quot;...proved I could do serious acting&quot;. In another turn in the &quot;not so nice&quot; category, MacMurray played the cynical, duplicitous Lieutenant Thomas Keefer in Dmytryk&#x27;s film &quot;The Caine Mutiny.&quot; Six years later, MacMurray played Jeff Sheldrake, a two-timing corporate executive in Wilder&#x27;s Oscar-winning film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. In 1958, he guest-starred in the premiere episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron City&quot; Western series, with George Montgomery and John Smith. MacMurray&#x27;s career continued upward the following year, when he was cast as the father in the Disney film &quot;The Shaggy Dog.&quot;

=== &quot;My Three Sons&quot; ===

In an interview with Hedda Hopper in 1956, MacMurray noted that he had been asked to take on the role of Perry Mason on television. He turned it down, saying &quot;I want to do as little TV work as possible – it&#x27;s lots of work. I guess I am just lazy&quot;.

From 1960 to 1972, he starred in &quot;My Three Sons,&quot; a long-running, highly rated TV series. Concurrently with it, MacMurray starred in other films, playing Professor Ned Brainard in &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; and its sequel &quot;Son of Flubber&quot;. Using his star-power clout, MacMurray had a provision in his &quot;My Three Sons&quot; contract that all of his scenes on that series were to be shot in two separate month-long production blocks and filmed first. That condensed performance schedule provided him more free time to pursue his work in films, maintain his ranch in Northern California, and enjoy his favorite leisure activity, golf. Over the years, MacMurray became one of the wealthiest actors in the entertainment industry, primarily from wise real estate investments and from his &quot;notorious frugality&quot;.

=== Retirement ===

In the early 1970s, MacMurray appeared in commercials for the Greyhound Lines bus company. In 1979, he appeared in a series of commercials for the Korean &quot;chisenbop&quot; math calculation program. MacMurray&#x27;s final film was &quot;The Swarm&quot;, costarring Michael Caine, Olivia de Havilland and Henry Fonda. The actor, semi-retired at this point, was called back for one last film by director Irwin Allen entitled &quot;Fire!&quot;; however, his diagnosis of throat cancer caused him to pull out. Allen then offered him the small role (for a total of two days on set) of a pharmacist in &quot;The Swarm&quot;. MacMurray told reporters that he didn&#x27;t &quot;...really miss it. A lot of actors go crazy if they aren&#x27;t working, but I guess I&#x27;m a little lazy.&quot; He successfully underwent treatment for his cancer during the production.

=== Business ventures ===
MacMurray was also a prolific businessman, frequently earning over $400,000 a year in the 1940s. In 1941, he purchased land in the Russian River Valley in Northern California and established MacMurray Ranch. At the ranch, he raised prize-winning Aberdeen Angus cattle, cultivated prunes, apples, alfalfa and other crops, and enjoyed watercolor painting, fly fishing, and skeet shooting. MacMurray wanted the property&#x27;s agricultural heritage preserved, so five years after his death, in 1996, it was sold to Gallo, which planted vineyards on it for wines that bear the MacMurray Ranch label. One of MacMurray&#x27;s children now lives on the property (in a cabin built by her father), and is &quot;actively engaged in Sonoma&#x27;s thriving wine community, carrying on her family&#x27;s legacy and the heritage of MacMurray Ranch&quot;.

In 1944, he purchased the Bryson Apartment Hotel in the Westlake, Los Angeles neighborhood for $600,000, using profits from &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, and was a co-owner of three other apartment buildings. The actor was cautious with his finances, which went hand-in-hand with his sedate lifestyle. The majority of his earnings were used for investments (including a knitting mill, co-owner of a golf-and-tennis club and a cold-storage business). MacMurray insisted upon a percentage of gross of the films in which he starred.

In 1945, along with former actor Leslie Fenton, MacMurray formed a production company, entitled &quot;Mutual Pictures&quot;. With this production company the pair made one film, &quot;Pardon My Past&quot;, a moderate success.

A 1977 profile dispelled the myth of MacMurray&#x27;s wealth, reporting that if he &quot;...sold everything I&#x27;d be worth maybe $3 million to $4 million. Maybe&quot;. He stated that the myth of his wealth being in league with Doris Duke and the Aga Khan ($75 to $100 million range) stemmed from his life-long frugality.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
MacMurray was married twice, first to Lillian &quot;Lily&quot; Lamont (legal name: Lilian Wehmhoener MacMurray, born 1908) and after her death, actress June Haver.

=== Lillian Lamont ===
Lamont and MacMurray met during the production of &quot;Roberta&quot; while in New York City while he was performing with the Collegians in 1934, and they quickly became an item. Despite the budding romance he left New York and returned to Hollywood in efforts to continue his career.

It was reported that upon his return he spurned a matchmaking attempt by gossip columnist Louella Parsons. Accounts vary, with some reporting that Parsons was angry over MacMurray&#x27;s refusal of her efforts, leading Parsons to attempt to derail his career. Other sources indicate that MacMurray turned down a party invitation from William Randolph Hearst (via Parsons), as the publisher had already identified another female as MacMurray&#x27;s date for the event. Parsons refers in a 1947 column that she and MacMurray made amends, &quot;...we let our hair down about a lot of things...principally a misunderstanding that marred a long friendship, and then and there cleaned up all our grievances&quot;, possibly alluding to the columnist&#x27;s attempts at career sabotage.

In 1934, the couple announced the news that they were in a &quot;test engagement&quot;, stating that they &quot;want to be sure before we make any official announcement&quot; that &quot;...their personalities were the type which could pull in a double harness while they followed their careers&quot;. By late spring in 1936, the couple decided to make it official. Late on the night of June 19, 1936, MacMurray, Lamont and MacMurray&#x27;s mother traveled by plane to Las Vegas to be married. The trip – and the marriage – were kept secret from friends and studio officials, who spent the day of the 20th trying to locate the actor. The newlyweds and family returned to Hollywood on a plane that same day.

In 1945, they moved into a 10-room, two-story Colonial house in Brentwood. Neighbors (and friends) included Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. Joan Crawford described the couple as having &quot;one of the few happy and well-adjusted marriages&quot;. While they were known to be homebodies and family-oriented, they were also social within the Hollywood community. They hosted parties, both large and small, for friends. They were close with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, often having Sunday afternoon BBQs with each other. At the larger gatherings, Lombard proved to be the source of entertainment for the assembled guests with her antics and off-color language.

Lamont was often in poor health, including kidney and heart problems. This is reportedly why MacMurray and Lamont adopted two children. In 1940, their daughter Susan joined the family, with formal adoption completed in 1942. Four years later they adopted one-and-a-half year-old Robert. Later in his son&#x27;s life, the father and son would drift apart, with MacMurray lamenting that Robert went &quot;the hippie route via the South Seas to &#x27;find himself&#x27;&quot;.

After struggling with physical health issues for most of her life, her condition deteriorated even further in the early 1950s. She eventually succumbed to kidney and heart issues in June 1953, shortly after the couple&#x27;s 17th wedding anniversary. In a 2006 interview between a MacMurray biographer and Lamont&#x27;s cousin, the family states that she suffered from bulimia. This may have stemmed from her days as a model and contributed to her other health issues.

=== June Haver ===

MacMurray first met actress June Haver when they starred in &quot;Where Do We Go From Here&quot; in 1945, although they had little interaction. By the early 1950s, Haver was grieving the sudden death of her fiancé Dr. John Duzik in 1949. In part because of her grief, Haver had considered a life as a nun. A life-long devout Catholic, she met with Pope Pius XII in 1951 and decided to follow her faith and join a convent. She realized after eight months that the convent life was not for her. In 1953, at a &quot;Gay Nineties&quot; party thrown by pal John Wayne, Haver and MacMurray met socially. Both had been reluctant to attend the party; however, they left together and quickly became an item. After the socially acceptable amount of time grieving the death of Lamont, the couple decided to make their relationship official, deciding to marry in 1954. This meant the actress had to renounce her Catholicism due to a previous divorce, having wed musician Jimmy Zito in 1947 before divorcing in 1948.

MacMurray purchased actor Red Skelton&#x27;s good-luck pinky ring as an engagement ring, officially proposing to Haver after a trip to a drugstore. They publicly announced their wedding date for the first week of August 1954; however, they actually wed over a month early, on June 28, to the surprise of friends and the press. With the help of friend Ray Cardillo, a travel agency owner, the ceremony was held at the Ojai Valley Inn. They honeymooned in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, while MacMurray finished working on &quot;The Far Horizons.&quot;

MacMurray stated in a 1954 interview that &quot;June had a serious operation after she fell at Fox Studios a couple of years ago...and she&#x27;s not sure if she will be able to have children&quot;. As a result of Haver&#x27;s inability to conceive, in 1956 they adopted fraternal twins, Laurie Ann and Katie Marie, &quot;right out of the incubator&quot;. 

Haver curtailed her Hollywood career after marrying MacMurray, with one final appearance on the &quot;Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot; in 1958 as herself. She stated that she had no desire to act further, &quot;I lost it all [desire]. I&#x27;m remaining a private citizen and will stay at home and work...it has been supplanted by something better. Now that I have four children in the family I have a lot to keep me busy&quot;. MacMurray did not believe that it was his place to keep Haver from acting, stating &quot;...I&#x27;d hate to be the one to keep her off the screen...the decision is up to her. I&#x27;d rather have her at home, but if she wants to make a picture, it&#x27;s okay with me&quot;.

Much like his marriage to Lamont, this union was by all accounts stable and happy. They remained married until MacMurray&#x27;s death in 1991.

=== Politics ===
Like many of his Hollywood contemporaries, MacMurray was a Republican politically, although he was not particularly outspoken about his beliefs. When speaking with columnist Parsons in 1947 about the Red Scare in Hollywood, the actor noted &quot;I suppose there really are some Reds in Hollywood...but don&#x27;t you think that actually some of the people...get that reputation because they talk too much about things they don&#x27;t understand? I don&#x27;t think an actor has any business to discuss politics unless he is an authority...&quot; He is further quoted &quot;...just because I happen to be an actor I shouldn&#x27;t get up and say &#x27;vote for this man&#x27;, knowing as little as I know about him...I&#x27;m a family man and that&#x27;s about it&quot;.

He joined a long list of Hollywood stars as a member of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, which was organized by the Communist Party of the USA in 1936. MacMurray appeared onstage along with other conservative luminaries stumping for Thomas Dewey in the 1944 Presidential election, and he supported Ronald Reagan for Governor of California in 1966.

==Illness and death==

A lifelong heavy smoker, MacMurray had throat cancer in the late 1970s, and it recurred in 1987. He had a severe stroke in December 1988 that paralyzed his right side and affected his speech. With therapy, he made a 90 percent recovery.

After suffering from leukemia for more than a decade, MacMurray died of pneumonia on November 5, 1991, in Santa Monica, California.

==Awards and influence==
In 1939, artist C. C. Beck used MacMurray as the initial model for the superhero character who became Fawcett Comics&#x27; Captain Marvel. 

MacMurray was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;. In 1987, he became the first person to be honored as a Disney Legend.

<text>A Severed Head is a satirical, sometimes farcical 1961 novel by Iris Murdoch. It was Murdoch&#x27;s fifth published novel.

Primary themes include marriage, adultery, and incest within a group of civilised and educated people. Set in and around London, it depicts a power struggle between grown-up middle-class people who are lucky to be free of real problems. &quot;A Severed Head&quot; was a harbinger of the sexual revolution that was to hit Britain in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Plot==

Martin Lynch-Gibbon is a well-to-do 41-year-old wine merchant whose childless marriage to an older woman called Antonia has been one of convenience rather than love. It never occurs to him that his ongoing secret affair with Georgie, a young academic in her twenties, could be immoral. Martin is shocked when his wife tells him that she has been having an affair with Palmer Anderson, her psychoanalyst and a friend of the couple. Antonia informs Martin that she wants to divorce him and marry Anderson.

Martin moves out of their London house in Hereford Square. Before officially moving, Martin visits his brother Alexander&#x27;s home near Oxford. While there he learns that Antonia has already written to Alexander about the divorce, leaving Alexander quite shaken. Later Martin returns to Hereford Square, where Antonia, now acting as a mother figure for him, tries to set up his new accommodation. After arguing with Antonia, he goes to the station to pick up Palmer&#x27;s half-sister Honor Klein, a lecturer in anthropology who is visiting from Cambridge.

Martin still does not want to publicly acknowledge his affair with Georgie, let alone become engaged to her. A few days later, Martin finally visits Georgie. While Georgie wants to publicize their affair, Martin refuses because he believes it will &quot;hurt&quot; Antonia. However, they decide to go to Hereford Square so that Georgie can see the house. While Martin is showing her around, they hear someone arrive at the house. Assuming it is Antonia, Martin rushes Georgie out the back door, despite her protests that she wishes to meet Antonia. The unexpected visitor turns out to be Honor, who notices Georgie&#x27;s handbag that was left behind in her rush out the door. After the event, Martin tries to contact Georgie but is unsuccessful and soon returns to the house. There he finds out that Palmer and Antonia know about his relationship with Georgie. Martin finds Georgie and learns that Honor Klein has exposed their secret. Soon after Georgie meets Antonia in an awkward situation.

Later, after a breakfast with Antonia, where they decide that Martin should take a short vacation, Martin calls on Georgie, only to discover his brother Alexander there. Martin is made even more furious when he discovers that Honor Klein was the person who introduced them to each other. After drunkenly returning to Hereford Square, Martin gets into a fight with Honor. After writing apology letters and waiting two days, Martin tries to find Antonia and Honor, only to find out that Antonia has gone and Honor is back in Cambridge.

Around this time, Martin also realizes that he is now madly in love with Honor. He follows her to Cambridge and, in the middle of the night, breaks into her house, only to find her in bed with her half-brother Palmer. Even though Martin doesn&#x27;t tell Antonia of this incestuous encounter, Palmer believes he has, and begins to act strangely around Antonia. Antonia decides that she should be with Martin instead, causing Martin to cut off his affair with Georgie. A few days later, Alexander comes by to inform Martin that he has become engaged to Georgie, rekindling Martin&#x27;s feelings for her and making him very upset.

After an angry confrontation with Palmer, who announces that he and Honor will be travelling abroad, Martin receives a package of hair from Georgie. Martin discovers an unconscious Georgie, who has attempted suicide, and is joined by Honor while waiting for the ambulance. After a scene in the hospital where everyone is gathered, Martin confesses his love to Honor. Honor says she knows but it does not matter because she is going away. Shortly afterwards, Antonia confesses to Martin that she has also been sleeping with his older brother Alexander ever since he introduced them, and that they will be getting married. In the end, Palmer and Georgie go away together, Alexander and Antonia are together, and Honor stays in England with Martin.

==Themes==

In &quot;A Severed Head&quot;, Murdoch succeeds in presenting a middle-aged bourgeois who initially thinks of himself as a survivor but realises that he is in fact a victim. Throughout the novel, all the main characters insist that they have long overcome conventional morality, that they are free agents in the truest sense of the word, but in spite of his hedonism Lynch-Gibbon&#x27;s residual moral posture just will not go away. Murdoch is particularly good at conveying the atmosphere of benevolence and the apparent lack of hard feelings among the individuals that have wronged and been wronged. (&quot;It is not at all our idea that you should leave us. In a strange and rather wonderful way we can&#x27;t do without you. We shall hold on to you, we shall look after you,&quot; Anderson says to Lynch-Gibbon, who sees himself as a cuckold rather than anything else.) At times funny, sad at others, &quot;A Severed Head&quot; also deals with more serious issues such as abortion (Georgie terminates her pregnancy at an early stage of her relationship with Lynch-Gibbon) and attempted suicide (again it is Georgie who tries to take her own life after being rejected by both Lynch-Gibbon and his brother).

Despite these serious overtones, &quot;A Severed Head&quot; is regarded by many readers as the most entertaining of Murdoch&#x27;s novels. As British novelist William Sutcliffe put it, &quot;Of all the lots-of-people-screwing-lots-of-other-people novels this is probably the best, and certainly the weirdest. With less philosophising and more shagging than Murdoch&#x27;s other books, it is a joy to see this wonderful writer let her hair (and her knickers) down.&quot;

==Adaptations==

With J.B. Priestley, Murdoch adapted her book for the stage. The play, directed by Val May, opened at the Theatre Royal, Bristol, in May 1963. In July 1963, it moved to the Criterion Theatre in London, for a run of 1,044 performances. In New York, after four previews, the Broadway production, also directed by May, opened on 28 October 1964 at the Royale Theatre, where it ran for only 29 performances. The cast included Sheila Burrell, reprising her role as Honor Klein, Robin Bailey again playing Martin Lynch-Gibbon, and Jessica Walter as Georgie. The novel was also made into a 1970 film starring Claire Bloom, Lee Remick, Richard Attenborough and Ian Holm. The screenplay was written by Frederic Raphael.

A five-part adaptation of &quot;A Severed Head&quot; by Stephen Wakelam appeared on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; in August 2015. The actors included Julian Rhind-Tutt as Martin Lynch-Gibbon, Helen Schlesinger as Honor Klein, and Victoria Hamilton as Antonia Lynch-Gibbon.

<text>The Great Lakes Waterway (GLW) is a system of natural channels and artificial locks and canals that enable navigation between the North American Great Lakes. Though all of the lakes are naturally connected as a chain, water travel between the lakes was impeded for centuries by obstacles such as Niagara Falls and the rapids of the St. Marys River.

Its principal civil engineering works are the Welland Canal between Lakes Ontario and Erie, and the Soo Locks between Huron and Superior. Dredged channels were constructed in the St. Marys River, the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and the St. Clair River between Huron and Erie. Usually, one or more U.S. Coast Guard icebreakers help keep the water passage open for part of the fall and early winter, although shipping usually ceases for two to three months thereafter. The St. Lawrence Seaway allows navigable shipping from the GLW to the Atlantic Ocean, while the Illinois Waterway extends commercial shipping to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The Great Lakes Waterway is co-administered by the governments of Canada and the United States.

==Description==
The waterway allows passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the inland port of Duluth on Lake Superior, a distance of and to Chicago, on Lake Michigan, at . The elevation change from Lake Superior to sea level is .

Together with the Saint Lawrence Seaway, the Waterway accommodates both ocean-going vessels and ore, grain, and coal-bearing lake freighters that travel from the system&#x27;s saltwater outlet to its far interior. The Waterway has larger locks and deeper drafts than the lower Seaway, limiting large freighters to the four lakes upstream of the Welland Canal and Lake Ontario and similarly restricting passage beyond Saint Lambert, Quebec by larger ocean vessels. The two waterways are often jointly and simply referred to as the &quot;St. Lawrence Seaway&quot;, since the Great Lakes, together with the St. Lawrence River, comprise a single navigable body of freshwater linking the Atlantic Ocean to the continental interior. Major ports on the Great Lakes Waterway include Duluth-Superior, Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Two Harbors, Hamilton and Thunder Bay.

Shipping channels separate upbound traffic from downbound traffic. The upbound direction is away from the St. Lawrence River (westerly or northerly except in Lake Michigan where upbound is southerly). Channels are marked with navigation buoys in constricted areas and pilots are required on foreign boats. Recreational boats can use or cross the ship channels, but the large boats, with limited maneuverability, have right of way.

<doc id="86937" wikidata="Q187958" url="?curid=86937" title="Adélie penguin">
<text>The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is a species of penguin common along the entire coast of the Antarctic continent, which is the only place where it is found. It is the most widespread penguin species, and, along with the emperor penguin, is the most southerly distributed of all penguins. It is named after Adélie Land, in turn, named for Adèle Dumont d&#x27;Urville, who was married to French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, who first discovered this penguin in 1840. Adélie penguins obtain their food by both predation and foraging, with a diet of mainly krill and fish.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The first Adélie penguin specimens were collected by crew members of French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville on his expedition to Antarctica in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Jacques Bernard Hombron and Honoré Jacquinot, two French surgeons who doubled as naturalists on the journey, described the bird for science in 1841, giving it the scientific name &quot;Catarrhactes adeliæ&quot;. They used specimens collected from an area of the continent which had been named &quot;terre Adélie&quot;, French for Adélie Land, itself named for Dumont d&#x27;Urville&#x27;s wife, Adèle. The bird was later placed in several other genera, including &quot;Eudyptes&quot;, &quot;Pygoscelis&quot; and the now-defunct genus &quot;Dasyrhamphus&quot;, and was also later inadvertently redescribed as &quot;Pygoscelis brevirostris&quot;.

The Adélie penguin is one of three species now assigned to the genus &quot;Pygoscelis&quot;. DNA evidence suggests the &quot;Pygoscelis&quot; lineage diverged from that of other penguin species some 38 million years ago, roughly 2 million years after the ancestors of the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot; diverged. Adélie penguins evolved about 19 million years ago, branching from the ancestor of the other two members of the genus (chinstrap and gentoo penguins), both of which evolved some 5 million years later. Although it has no identifiable subspecies, the Adélie penguin has two distinct genetic lineages: one found primarily in the Ross Sea, and the other widespread throughout the Antarctic. 

The genus name &quot;Pygoscelis&quot; is a compound word, composed of the Ancient Greek words &quot;pugē&quot;, meaning &quot;rump&quot;, and &quot;skelos&quot;, meaning &quot;leg&quot;. The members of this genus are often called &quot;brush-tailed penguins&quot;, a reference to their long, stiff tail feathers. The birds regularly use their tails for support, and the stiff feathers sweep the ground as the penguins walk. The specific name &quot;adeliae&quot; indicates the location from which the type specimen was collected.

== Description ==
The Adélie penguin is a mid-sized bird, measuring in length and weighing . Although the sexes look the same, females have shorter wings and beaks and weigh significantly less. The adult is black on the head, throat and upper parts, with snowy white underparts. It has a conspicuous white around a black iris. The beak is largely covered with black feathers, leaving only the tip exposed; this is primarily black, though it can show indistinct reddish-brown markings. The upper surface of the wing is black with a white trailing edge, while the underside is white with a narrow black leading edge and a small black tip. The legs and feet, which are mostly unfeathered, are pinkish.

Upon hatching, the chick is fully covered in down feathers. This coat of feathers is typically silvery-grey (darker on the head), though some birds are much darker overall. Within 10 days, the chick moults into another set of down feathers, this time all dark smoky-grey. Once they have moulted a third time, 7–9 weeks after hatching, the immature birds are similar to adults in appearance, though they tend to be smaller with a bluer tinge to their upperparts and white (rather than black) chins and throats. They lack the full white eye ring of the adult until they are at least a year old.

===Similar species===
The adult Adélie penguin is unlikely to be confused with any other species, but the white-throated immature bird can resemble the chinstrap penguin. However, the black on its face extends below its eyes, and it lacks a black line under the throat (the &quot;chinstrap&quot;) that the chinstrap penguin has. In addition, the bill of the chinstrap penguin is longer, and lacks the feathering that covers most of the bill of the Adélie penguin.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Adélie penguin is a truly Antarctic creature – one of only four penguin species to nest on the continent itself. Breeding colonies are scattered along Antarctica&#x27;s coasts and on a number of sub-Antarctic islands, including those in the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, the South Sandwich Islands, the Balleny Islands, Scott Island and South Georgia. The penguins are much less common north of the 60th parallel south but have occurred as vagrants in Australia, New Zealand and southern South America. During the breeding season, they need bare, rocky ground on which to build their nests. They will not nest on ice, and preferentially choose areas where wind or the angle of the sun (or both) helps to keep snow drifts from accumulating. At the start of the breeding seasons, colony sites may be up to from open water, though the distance decreases as summer progresses and the pack ice breaks up.

Once they have finished breeding, adult Adélie penguins typically move to ice floes or ice shelves to moult, though some remain onshore. During the winter, the birds remain in the pack ice zone, with most moving north to reach areas where there is visible light for at least part of the day – thus north of roughly 73°S. While some remain near their breeding colonies, others may move hundreds or thousands of kilometres away. As long as there are breaks in the pack ice, they can survive hundreds of kilometres south of open water, and birds are known to forage in winter in areas with up to 80% pack ice cover.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a survivor of Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition of 1910, documented details of penguin behaviour in his book &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;. &quot;They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children or like old men, full of their own importance...&quot; George Murray Levick, a Royal Navy surgeon-lieutenant and scientist who also accompanied Scott, commented on displays of selfishness among the penguins during his surveying in the Antarctic: &quot;At the place where they most often went in [the water], a long terrace of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.&quot; Levick also detailed the mating habits of Adélie penguins.

One writer observed how the penguin&#x27;s curiosity could also endanger them, which Scott found a particular nuisance:


Others on the mission to the South Pole were more receptive to this element of the Adélies&#x27; curiosity. Cherry-Garrard writes:

Cherry-Garrard held the birds in great regard. &quot;Whatever a penguin does has individuality, and he lays bare his whole life for all to see. He cannot fly away. And because he is quaint in all that he does, but still more because he is fighting against bigger odds than any other bird, and fighting always with the most gallant pluck, he comes to be considered as something apart from the ordinary bird...&quot;

Despite their size, Adélie penguins are known for their bold and boisterous personality and will challenge other animals, including predators far larger than them. In footage shot for the 2018 BBC Earth documentary &quot;Spy in the Snow&quot;, the boisterous behaviour of Adélie penguins was made especially apparent when an individual arrived to defend a group of emperor penguin chicks that were being menaced by a Southern giant petrel (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;). Despite the species difference between the Adélie and the emperors, the individual charged the petrel, then placed itself between the predator and the chicks until it retreated.

Adélie penguins usually swim at around . They are able to leap some out of the water to land on rocks or ice.

===Food and feeding===
The Adélie penguin is known to feed mainly on Antarctic krill, ice krill, Antarctic silverfish, lanternfish (specifically, the Antarctic lanternfish), amphipods (&quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;, &quot;Cyllopus lucassi&quot;, &quot;Hyperia&quot; and unidentified gammariids), sea krill, glacial squid and other cephalopods (diet varies depending on geographic location) during the chick-rearing season. The stable isotope record of fossil eggshell accumulated in colonies over the last 38,000 years reveals a sudden change from a fish-based diet to krill that began around 200 years ago. This is most likely due to the decline of the Antarctic fur seal since the late 18th century and baleen whales during the early 20th century. The reduction of competition from these predators has resulted in a surplus of krill, which the penguins now exploit as an easier source of food.

Jellyfish including species in the genera &quot;Chrysaora&quot; and &quot;Cyanea&quot; were found to be actively sought-out food items, while they previously had been thought to be only accidentally ingested. Similar preferences were found in the little penguin, yellow-eyed penguin and Magellanic penguin.

===Breeding===


Adélie penguins breed from October to February on shores around the Antarctic continent. Adélies build rough nests of stones. Two eggs are laid; these are incubated for 32 to 34 days by the parents taking turns (shifts typically last for 12 days). The chicks remain in the nest for 22 days before joining crèches. The chicks moult into their juvenile plumage and go out to sea after 50 to 60 days.

Adélie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in late October or November, after completing a migration that takes them away from the Antarctic continent for the dark, cold winter months. Their nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about /-19 °C or -2.2 °F), the parents take turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent that is incubating does not eat and does not even leave to defecate but instead projects faeces away from the nest. In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Adélie penguin lives on sea ice but needs ice-free land to breed. With a reduction in sea ice, populations of the Adélie penguin have dropped by 65% over the past 25 years in the Antarctic Peninsula.

Young Adélie penguins that have no experience in social interaction may react to false cues when the penguins gather to breed. They may, for instance, attempt to mate with other males, with young chicks or with dead females. Levick was the first to record such behaviour (1911–12), but his notes were deemed too indecent for publication at the time; they were rediscovered and published in 2012. &quot;The pamphlet, declined for publication with the official Scott expedition reports, commented on the frequency of sexual activity, auto-erotic behaviour and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females, including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks and homosexual behaviour,&quot; states the analysis written by Douglas Russell and colleagues William Sladen and David Ainley. &quot;His observations were, however, accurate, valid and, with the benefit of hindsight, deserving of publication.&quot; Levick observed the Adélie penguins at Cape Adare, the site of the largest Adélie penguin rookery in the world. , he has been the only one to study this particular colony and he observed it for an entire breeding cycle. The discovery significantly illuminates the behaviour of the species whose population some researchers believe to be a bellwether of climate change.

Some Adélie penguins also actively and deliberately engage in homosexual activity. In one instance recorded in 1996, two wild male individuals courted each other and took turns mounting and copulating with each other. The reciprocal nature of the event indicates that both individuals were aware that they were courting and copulating with another male. The observing researchers suggested that this was practice for heterosexual encounters or a &quot;response to high sexual motivation but a lack of females.&quot;

===Migration===
Adélie penguins living in the Ross Sea region in Antarctica migrate an average of about each year as they follow the sun from their breeding colonies to winter foraging grounds and back again. During the winter, the sun does not rise south of the Antarctic Circle, but sea ice grows during the winter months and increases for hundreds of miles from the shoreline, and into more northern latitudes, all around Antarctica. As long as the penguins live at the edge of the fast ice, they will see sunlight. As the ice recedes in the spring, the penguins remain on the edge of it, until once again, they are on the shoreline during a sunnier season. The longest treks have been recorded at .

===Osmoregulation===
Adélie penguins are faced with extreme osmotic conditions, as their frozen habitats offer little fresh water. Such desert conditions mean that the vast majority of the available water is highly saline, causing the diets of Adélie penguins to be heavy in salt. They manage to circumvent this problem by eating krill with internal concentrations of salt at the lower end of their possible concentrations, helping to lower the amount of ingested salts. The amount of sodium imposed by this sort of diet is still relatively heavy and can create complications when considering the less tolerant chicks. Adult Adélie penguins feed their chicks by regurgitating the predigested krill, which can impose an excessive salt intake on the chicks. Adult birds address this problem by altering the ion concentrations while the food is still being held in their stomachs. By removing a portion of the sodium and potassium ions, adult Adélie penguins protect their chicks from ingesting excessive amounts of sodium. Adélie penguins also manage their salt intake by concentrating cloacal fluids to a much higher degree than most other birds are capable. This ability is present regardless of ontogeny in Adélie penguins, meaning that both adults and juveniles are capable of withstanding extreme levels of salt ion concentration. However, chicks do possess a greater ability to concentrate chloride ions in their cloacal fluids. Salt glands also play a major role in the excretion of excess salts. In aquatic birds such as the Adelie penguin, nasal salt glands excrete an extremely concentrated sodium chloride solution, reducing the load on their kidneys.

These excretions are crucial in the maintenance of Antarctic ecosystems. Penguin rookeries can be home to thousands of penguins, all of which are concentrating waste products in their digestive tracts and nasal glands. These excretions inevitably drop to the ground. The concentration of salts and nitrogenous wastes helps to facilitate the flow of material from the sea to the land, serving to make it habitable for bacteria which live in the soils.

===Threats===
Adult Adélie penguins are regularly preyed upon by leopard seals. South polar skuas, in particular, and giant petrels kill many chicks and eat eggs as well. Giant petrels and orcas will occasionally kill adult Adelie penguins. Kelp gulls and snowy sheathbills also prey on chicks and eggs.

In 2024, researchers from Federation University Australia reported more than 532 dead Adélie penguins on Antarctica&#x27;s Heroína Island, with the H5N1 bird flu suspected as the cause. The virus, having arrived in South America in 2022, poses a risk to Antarctic wildlife. Samples from the deceased penguins are under analysis, and the H5 strain has been detected in local skua seabirds, potentially facilitating further spread. This situation is particularly concerning for the wildlife of the region, which includes an estimated 20 million pairs of penguins and the already climate-threatened emperor penguins.

==Status==

Because of its very large and increasing population (estimated at more than 10 million mature individuals in 2020), and its unfragmented habitat, the Adélie penguin is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a species of least concern.

A comprehensive census of the global Adélie penguin population was carried out in 2014 using analysis of high-resolution satellite images in combination with actual field surveys. The researchers looked for guano-discoloured coastal areas (red/brown patches in areas with no snow) in the satellite images, and augmented their findings with field surveys in areas where no good satellite images were available or where the presence of multiple penguins species was suspected. The results of field surveys were only used if they had been done within the previous four years. This census found an estimated 3.79 million breeding pairs in 251 distinct breeding colonies, including more than 40 that had never been surveyed before, a 53% increase over a census completed 20 years earlier. The colonies are distributed around the coastline of the Antarctic land and ocean. Colonies have declined on the Antarctic Peninsula since the early 1980s, but those declines have been more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. During the breeding season, they congregate in large breeding colonies, some over a quarter of a million pairs. Individual colonies can vary dramatically in size, and some may be particularly vulnerable to climate fluctuations. The Danger Islands have been identified as an &quot;important bird area&quot; by BirdLife International largely because it supports Adélie penguin colonies, with 751,527 pairs recorded in at least five distinct colonies. In March 2018, a colony of 1.5 million was discovered.

<doc id="86939" wikidata="Q981299" url="?curid=86939" title="Alfred Deller">
<text>Alfred George Deller, CBE (31 May 1912 – 16 July 1979), was an English singer and one of the main figures in popularising the return of the countertenor voice in Renaissance and Baroque music during the 20th century.

He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;godfather of the countertenor&quot;. His style in singing lute song, with extensive use of rubato and extemporised ornamentation, was seen as radical and controversial in his day but is now considered the norm.

Deller was an influential figure in the renaissance of early music: an early proponent of &quot;original instrument performance&quot; and one of the first to bring this form to the popular consciousness through his broadcasts on the BBC. He also founded the Stour Music Festival in 1962, one of the first and most important early music festivals in the world.

==Life and career==
===Church music===
Deller was born in Margate, a seaside resort in Kent. As a boy, he sang in his local church choir. When his voice broke, he continued singing in his high register, eventually settling as a countertenor. Deller was initially employed as a lay clerk at Canterbury Cathedral from 1940 to 1947, before joining the choir of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (1947–62).

===Solo career===
From this choral tradition, Deller emerged as a soloist, largely as a result of the admiration of the composer Michael Tippett, who heard him while at Canterbury and recognised the unique beauty of his voice. Tippett introduced him to the public as a countertenor, rather than a male alto. He also became better known with a radio broadcast of Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Come Ye Sons of Art&quot; on the BBC Third Programme when this station was launched in 1946. He concentrated on popularising and recording the music of English Baroque and Renaissance music by composers such as John Dowland and Purcell.

===Style===
Throughout the 19th century, it was only in the tradition of all-male cathedral choirs that the countertenor voice had survived. Deller&#x27;s voice sounded remarkably high. Misconceptions about the countertenor voice were common at the time Deller was first gaining significant notice as a singer, which was only a matter of decades after the last castrato had died; Michael Chance tells the story that once, a French woman, upon hearing Deller sing, exclaimed &quot;Monsieur, vous êtes eunuque&quot;—to which Deller replied, &quot;I think you mean &#x27;unique&#x27;, Madam.&quot;

===Deller Consort===
In 1948, Deller formed the Deller Consort, a group dedicated to historically informed performance. The group recorded music from as early as the 13th century and significantly expanded popular notions of the Baroque repertoire, producing high-quality authentic period performances of the works of Bach, Handel, Purcell, Dowland, and even folk songs.

Membership of the Deller Consort changed over the years, particularly the top line (sopranos April Cantelo, Honor Sheppard and Mary Thomas. It included various baritones (especially Maurice Bevan) and tenors (especially Philip Todd). From 1964, Alfred Deller&#x27;s son Mark was a member. In 1972, the Deller Consort performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston.

Despite his experience directing the consort, Deller&#x27;s conducting of chamber orchestras attracted some adverse comment regarding technique.

===Collaborations===
In 1960, Deller sang the role of Oberon in the first production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Britten wrote this role with Deller specifically in mind, although he was dropped from staged revivals of the work against the composer&#x27;s wishes, largely because of poor acting technique. The smallness of his voice was also a negative factor in the casting process at Covent Garden. He did record the opera, with the composer conducting in 1967. The 1960 premiere, broadcast by the BBC, is now commercially available and finds Deller in fresher voice; Myfanwy Piper described his singing of Oberon as &quot;unearthly&quot;.

Lutenist Desmond Dupré performed with him, initially as a guitarist; other accompanists included harpsichordist and musicologist Walter Bergmann. In later years, he worked with lutenist Robert Spencer and harpsichordists Harold Lester and William Christie. His recordings include the lute songs of Dowland, operas by Handel, Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, songs and semioperas by Purcell (such as &quot;The Fairy Queen&quot;), traditional English folk songs, works by Thomas Tallis, and the Bach alto repertoire. He recorded for HMV, Vanguard Classics, and Harmonia Mundi.

Deller also sang John Blow and Henry Purcell Odes like &quot;Sound the trumpet&quot; from Come Ye Sons of Art with the other great counter-tenor of the day, John Whitworth (1921–2013), who is favoured by critic Richard Lawrence for his magnificent voice.

===Death===
On 16 July 1979, Deller died after a heart attack suffered whilst working in Bologna in Italy. Deller and his wife are buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church, Boughton Aluph, Kent.

==Family==
Deller married Kathleen Margaret (&#x27;Peggy&#x27;) Lowe (1913–2006) in 1937. They had three children; the eldest, Mark Deller, became an accomplished singer in his own right and frequently performed with his father, for example on the 1972 album &quot;Folksongs&quot;. Another son, Simon, trained as a music teacher during the 1960s and taught at Guildford Cathedral choir school, eventually becoming its headmaster.

==Honours==
Deller was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year Honours.

In Canterbury Cathedral, a tablet in the south quire aisle commemorates Deller and his work.

On 31 May 2012, All Saints&#x27; Church, Boughton Aluph held a concert to celebrate Deller&#x27;s 100th birthday. There was also an exhibition of paintings and drawings by John Ward, who illustrated many of the early programmes for the music festival. After the concert, the countertenor James Bowman planted a tree in memory of Deller in the churchyard where he is buried.

==Selected discography==
Deller made at least 136 recordings from 1949 to his death in 1979. His first were for HMV – His Master&#x27;s Voice Recordings 1949–1954. Then followed 13 years with Vanguard Records 1954–1967, under the labels The Bach Guild in Europe and Amadeo in the US. Then following a concert in Avignon in 1967 where Deller met Bernard Coutaz, founder of Harmonia Mundi France, Deller spent his remaining years with the French label.

<text>Rosenborg Ballklub, commonly referred to simply as Rosenborg () or RBK, is a Norwegian professional football club from Trondheim that plays in Eliteserien. The club has won a record 26 league titles, a shared record 12 Norwegian Football Cup titles and have played more UEFA matches than any other Norwegian team. RBK play their home games at the all-seater Lerkendal Stadion which has a capacity of 21,421.

The club was founded as Odd in 1917 but were not allowed to play amateur league matches until 1928, when they took the present name. They reached the League of Norway in 1937–38, but were relegated to lower divisions during the 1940s. The club moved to Lerkendal in 1957 and their first title was the 1960 Cup, resulting in their first participation in a UEFA tournament. It was not until the 1960s that RBK was established as Trondheim&#x27;s leading football team. In 1967 RBK was promoted to the top league where they, except for the 1978 season, have remained ever since. They won three league titles between 1967 and 1971. The club&#x27;s golden era started with the 1985 league title. From 1991 through 2004 the team won 13 consecutive titles, 10 under manager Nils Arne Eggen. During this period, they also participated in the group stage of Champions League 11 times, reaching the quarter-finals in 1996–97.

== History ==
=== Early years (1917–1959) ===

On 19 May 1917, 12 young men from &quot;Rosenborg&quot; in Trondheim founded Sportsklubben Odd. The name &quot;Odd&quot; was a tribute to Odd of Skien, the most successful team in Norway at the time. Odd spent their first few years playing against other local teams before attempting to join the regional series in 1920. As with most of the &quot;buddy&quot; clubs formed at the time, they were repeatedly denied access. Since many of these players also played for the bigger teams, the authorities feared a possible shortage of players if too many small clubs were let in. As the years went by, disillusioned players began leaving the club, and in 1923 the first team played only a single match.

By 1926, management of the club had passed on to a new generation of members, and it was through their efforts that Odd were finally admitted into the regional series in 1927, ten years after the club was founded. A year later they were set for entry into the Football Association of Norway, but their entry was blocked as the association refused to have two member clubs with the same name. The club therefore took on its current name, Rosenborg Ballklub, on 26 October 1928. Rosenborg is a mainly residential area in Trondheim.

Rosenborg enjoyed little success at first, moving constantly between the lower divisions of the regional series. Yet their performance was improving and in 1931 the team qualified for the highest level, and one year later they played in the Norwegian Cup for the first time. It was also at this time that Rosenborg started planning for a new home ground at &quot;Lerkendal&quot;, although this project was not completed until after World War II.

=== The breakthrough (1960–1968) ===

Rosenborg&#x27;s youth team has been one of the best in the country ever since the club was founded and an especially talented generation of youth players during the 1950s would grow up to form the basis for the first team&#x27;s success in the 1960s and onwards. In 1960 Rosenborg progressed all the way to the cup final where they faced Odd, the team from which they had adopted their original name and colours from in 1917. It took a rematch to decide the winner, but Rosenborg were able to claim their first trophy. Rosenborg won the cup again in 1964.

Rosenborg was promoted from the regional league to group A of the main Norwegian league in 1960. The following season the two groups of the top flight were combined into a single league of 16 teams with the teams finishing in the bottom half being relegated to the 2nd division. Rosenborg finished as number 9 out of the 16 teams and was relegated to the new 2nd division where they played from 1963 until they won promotion by winning group B in 1966.

In 1967 Rosenborg was promoted to the highest level in Norwegian football, the Main League (later the 1st Division) for the first time. This would prove to be a highly successful year for the club. Led on by such players as Harald Sunde, Nils Arne Eggen, and the talented young forward Odd Iversen, Rosenborg won their first league title. Iversen scored 17 goals in 18 matches that year, and would go on to score a massive 30 goals in the following season, although he alone could not prevent Rosenborg from being beaten to the title by Lyn. By the end of the 1960s it was clear that Rosenborg had emerged as one of Norway&#x27;s leading football clubs.

The 1960s saw Rosenborg venture onto the European stage for the first time. As winners of the cup in 1964, the club debuted in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup the following year. Three years later, Rosenborg entered the European Cup as winners of the league.

=== Ups and downs (1969–1987) ===

Rosenborg hired Englishman George Curtis as coach ahead of the 1969 season. Curtis introduced the new 4–4–2 formation and shifted focus towards tactics and organization rather than all-out attacking football. This move worked well to begin with, as Rosenborg were crowned league winners for the third time. However, when both Odd Iversen and Harald Sunde left the club, Rosenborg virtually stopped scoring goals and failed to win again in 1970. Curtis was criticized for being too defensively minded and was replaced by recently retired player Nils Arne Eggen, who reverted to a more crowd-pleasing style of play. Eggen&#x27;s first of five tenures as coach was a resounding success; Rosenborg won The Double.

The 1971 Double marked the end of the club&#x27;s first golden age. Rosenborg lost the cup final two consecutive seasons and began to struggle in the league. A flurry of coaches (including Eggen) came and went without making an impact and in 1977 the team won only one match the entire season, finishing dead last.

Nils Arne Eggen was then called in for his third tenure, from 1978 to 1982, and with the return of the now 35-year-old Odd Iversen, Rosenborg climbed back into the 1st Division the following year. In 1979, Iversen became top goalscorer for the fourth time in his career, but by the time he had retired in 1982, the club had still not regained its former glory. That would finally happen in 1985 when, after 14 trophyless years, Rosenborg defeated Lillestrøm in the final match of the season to win the league by a single point.

=== Domination, The Nils Arne Eggen Era (1988–2002) ===

The year 1985 may have been a turning point in Rosenborg&#x27;s fortunes, but it was in 1988 that things really started to happen. The club received fresh capital from its new main sponsor and was fully professionalized. Nils Arne Eggen returned to Trondheim to once again become head coach, this after leading Moss to the league title in 1987. In the waning years of the 1980s, the club secured Doubles twice (1988 and 1990).

Rosenborg went on to dominate Norwegian club football throughout the 1990s. In strong contrast to the Norwegian national team&#x27;s defensive and often criticized (yet highly effective) style of play at the time, Rosenborg achieved success through strict adherence to crowd-pleasing, attacking football. The Norwegian Premier League, established in 1991, was won 13 consecutive seasons from 1992. The Norwegian Cup was won five times.

In 1995, Rosenborg qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time, a feat which helped secure the club&#x27;s finances and further cement its dominance at the domestic level. The income provided through successive qualifications has allowed Rosenborg to become by far the wealthiest club in Norway. Always able to offer the most promising new players better terms than their opponents, as well as the prospect of playing in Europe, Rosenborg were assured of future league championships and European qualifications. During this period, few clubs were ever able to mount a serious challenge for more than a season at a time.

=== European adventures ===

Rosenborg participated in the group phase of the Champions League 11 times in the 13 years between 1995 and 2007. Eight of them were consecutive (from 1995 to 2002), which was a record until 2004, when Manchester United qualified for the group phase for a ninth successive year.

Rosenborg have on two occasions managed to progress beyond the first group stage of the Champions League. In the 1996–97 season, they were heading for an early exit, but with Milan squandering valuable points, the stage was set for a deciding match at San Siro. Rosenborg defeated Milan 2–1, ousting the Italians and putting themselves in the quarter-finals, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate against Juventus. In the 1999–2000 season, Rosenborg won their group to secure a place in the second group stage. The most memorable game was away against Borussia Dortmund, who were defeated 3–0.

Other highlights include the 2–0 win against Real Madrid and a 5–1 victory over Olympiacos, both in the 1997–98 season. There have also been some dismal performances, particularly against French teams. Rosenborg lost 0–5 to Lyon in 2002 and were crushed 2–7 by Paris Saint-Germain in 2000.

The Norwegians failed to qualify in 2003, losing out to Deportivo La Coruña, but managed to qualify again in 2004 after beating Maccabi Haifa, and in 2005 – despite the disappointing season – they qualified for the tenth time after winning 4–3 against Steaua București.

Rosenborg managed to qualify for the 11th time in 2007. The club impressed with a 1–1 draw away against Chelsea and beating Valencia 2–0 both home and away.

In July 2009, Rosenborg was eliminated from the UEFA Europa League in the second qualifying round against Qarabag of Azerbaijan. A year later, in August 2010, Rosenborg were eliminated in the UEFA Champions League in the play-off round, after a 2–2 draw against Danish side Copenhagen, with Copenhagen qualifying due to the away goals rule.

=== Consolidation (2003) ===

At the end of 2002 Rosenborg saw the retirement of Nils Arne Eggen after many successful years, during which he was only relieved once, in the 1998 season, by his assistant, Trond Sollied. Eggen was replaced by Åge Hareide, who had previously led both Helsingborg and Brøndby to championships in their respective leagues.

Hareide asserted that in order to not only stay ahead at the domestic level, but also perform better at the European level, Rosenborg would have to become more cynical and focus more on defensive skill, while still maintaining the offensive play that had made the team so strong in the first place. The new manager also highlighted the need to renew the aging squad, whose continuity had been another key to the club&#x27;s success; many of the players had been in the club since the start of the 1990s. In a controversial move, Hareide began this process by releasing the popular Bent Skammelsrud, who subsequently retired.

Under new leadership, Rosenborg laid waste to the league, losing only three games and winning 14 points ahead of runners-up Bodø/Glimt. The club claimed its seventh successive Double, again defeating Bodø/Glimt in the cup final. Despite failing to qualify for the Champions League, Rosenborg had enjoyed another great season and it looked like Hareide&#x27;s beginning reforms were paying off, but 2003 turned out to be his one and only season at the club as he accepted an offer to lead the Norwegian national team in December of that year. He was replaced by his assistant Ola By Rise, a notable former goalkeeper and goalkeeping coach at the club.

=== Troubled times (2004–2005) ===

With Hareide&#x27;s unexpected departure at the end of 2003 the club failed to properly execute the reforms he had begun. It also became clear that with the increased flow of capital into Norwegian football, some clubs were finally beginning to perform at a more consistent level close, or even equal, to that of Rosenborg. Rosenborg were no longer able to dominate every match, instead taking on the appearance of a team fed up with success.

Rosenborg were league winners again in 2004 but it was only through more goals scored that they were able to claim the title. Ola By Rise&#x27;s contract was terminated in October, even though he succeeded in leading the team to the Champions League, and for some time it was uncertain who would take over. In November the club announced the return of Nils Arne Eggen as an advisor to former assistant manager, Per Joar Hansen, who was promoted to manager. Bjørn Hansen and Rune Skarsfjord would also act as assistant managers.

The scheme proved so unsuccessful that Rosenborg&#x27;s 2005 season was for the most part a disaster. The club battled to avoid falling into the relegation zone for much of the season; Eggen left his role midways, and Per Joar Hansen left in August. Per-Mathias Høgmo followed Hansen as the club&#x27;s manager immediately after his departure. His first months were marred by a series of embarrassing losses and an early exit from the cup, but with a late-season return to form the team held on to its place in the top flight and finishing third in the Champions League Group Stage, qualifying them for the UEFA Cup.

=== Turbulence (2006–2012) ===

Rosenborg&#x27;s woes continued in the spring of 2006. Halfway through the season, rival Brann held a commanding 10-point lead. On 27 July, Per-Mathias Høgmo went on sick leave, citing burn-out as the cause. Assistant manager Knut Tørum took up the reins. For the third time in three years, an assistant would take the helm. This time, however, it was a complete success. Rosenborg won eight straight games, eliminating Brann&#x27;s lead, and finally overtaking them. On 22 October, in what was described as &quot;the biggest clash since the Battle of Stiklestad&quot;, Rosenborg defeated Brann away, giving the club a six-point lead with two rounds to go. The following weekend, Rosenborg defeated Viking, securing the club&#x27;s 20th league title. On 31 October, Per-Mathias Høgmo ended prolonged speculation on whether he would return and in what role, when he held a press conference where he stated that he resigned as manager with immediate effect, and would withdraw from football altogether. Tørum accepted an offer to be the permanent manager. Another resignation came on 11 February 2007, when director Rune Bratseth announced his resignation, citing among other things huge pressure from the media as his reason to resign. He was replaced by Knut Thorbjørn Eggen, son of former manager Nils Arne Eggen, from 1 August.

Despite the good result in 2006, manager Knut Tørum wasn&#x27;t able to gain the same success in the 2007 season. That, together with his troubles to get along with director Knut Thorbjørn Eggen resulted in his resignation on 25 October 2007. Assistant manager Trond Henriksen took charge of the club for the remainder of the 2007 season. Rosenborg finished the season in 5th place.

After Tørum&#x27;s resignation, Rosenborg started negotiating with Trond Sollied to fill the head coach vacancy. Sollied, who since his departure in 1998 had become a merited coach in Belgium, had earlier been linked back to Rosenborg at several occasions. After a lengthy process Sollied turned down the job, giving ammunition to those criticizing the way in which Rosenborg has dealt with their recurring head coach issue in the latter years. On 28 December, Rosenborg announced Erik Hamrén as their new coach for the 2008 season. Hamrén started as coach in Rosenborg on 1 June 2008, after he had fulfilled his duties as coach for Aalborg BK. Days before Hamren&#x27;s arrival Knut Thorbjørn Eggen announced his immediate resignation. The media speculated Eggen&#x27;s resignation had been demanded by Hamrén in order to gain total control over the club. At 27 July 2008, Rosenborg became the first Norwegian team ever to win a final match in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, beating Dutch team NAC Breda 2–1 on aggregate. The win put RBK in the 2nd Qualifying Round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, where they advanced to the Group Stage. They did not win the Intertoto Cup, however; under rules instituted for the 2006 competition, the trophy is awarded to the Intertoto Cup club that advances farthest in the UEFA Cup. In the group stage Rosenborg failed to impress, finishing last with two points. The club also failed in the League, finishing at a disappointing 5th place, for a consecutive season.

Ahead of the 2009 season Hamrén brought several new players to Rosenborg, one of them being Rade Prica, who Hamrén knew well from Aalborg. At the end of the season, Rosenborg won the league with 69 points, 13 points ahead of their nearest rival Molde FK. Rosenborg lost only one league game, a 3–2 loss against IK Start. Rosenborg had their run to the Double stopped by Molde in the cup&#x27;s quarter final, losing 5–0. The club got their revenge in late September, when they defeated Molde in the league and by that secured their 21st league title.

On 20 May 2010 it was decided that Nils Arne Eggen would lead Rosenborg for the 2010 season. He took over after Erik Hamrén who went to be the Manager for the national team of Sweden. Erik Hamréns last match was a 2–1 away win against Viking FK on 24 May.

On 24 October 2010, Rosenborg won the league for the 22nd time after winning 1–0 against Tromsø IL. On 7 November, Rosenborg played the last league game of the season against Aalesund, ending in a 2–2 draw, which meant that they went unbeaten all season in the league competition.

Jan Jönsson, whose contract with Stabæk ended after the 2010 season, was hired as head coach ahead of the 2011 season and he led the team for two seasons, where Rosenborg finishing third in the league and qualified for the Europe League group stage both years. However, the club was not happy with Jönsson&#x27;s results as head coach and he was sacked on 7 December 2012.

=== Back to the roots project (2013–2014) ===

In the search for a new head coach, Per Joar Hansen was linked to Rosenborg, but the message was not well received from the supporters. Hansen&#x27;s previous stay at Lerkendal ended poorly, and therefore many fans were skeptical of him as the replacement for Jan Jönsson. On 14 December 2012, Per Joar Hansen was confirmed as new head coach, with the ambition to take Rosenborg back to the top of the league. Hansen&#x27;s first major modification was changing from Rosenborg&#x27;s regular 4–4–2 to the more aggressive 4–3–3 as they played in the 90&#x27;s, taking the team back to the roots.
Hansen&#x27;s change of formation did not become well received when Rosenborg only scored three goals in their eight pre-season matches.
After half the season finished the team impressed everyone with great progress in the Norwegian Cup, being 2nd in the league, and as expected progressing from the Europa League first qualifying round by beating Northern Irish Crusaders, 2–1 away and ending with 7–2 victory at Lerkendal.

However, the beginning of the second half of the season shocked everyone when Rosenborg were surprisingly beaten by St Johnstone in the Europa League second qualifying round. Frazer Wright&#x27;s goal earned the Scottish side a memorable 1–0 victory in Norway before fighting back from an early goal to draw 1–1 at home. This was enough to secure a 2–1 aggregate victory for St Johnstone.
Rosenborg continued to gather points in the league, but were shocked when they lost to relegation threatened Tromsø in the 23rd round. They finished in 2nd place, one point behind Strømsgodset, mainly due to their performance at home.

Rosenborg had managed to enter the Cup Final against arch-rival Molde. This was Rosenborg&#x27;s first Cup Final since 2003, when they beat Bodø/Glimt 3–1.
Unfortunately for Rosenborg, they lost the match 2–4 after leading 2–1.

In June 2014, after a disappointing spring season with elimination from the Cup in the third round against Ranheim, lack of stable performance in the league and an embarrassing defeat against Sligo Rovers in the Europa League, it was decided to fire head coach Per Joar Hansen and assistant coach Bård Wiggen.
Former Rosenborg player and assistant coach Kåre Ingebrigtsen was presented as temporary coach on 21 July 2014, and sports director Erik Hoftun was presented as assistant coach. Rosenborg played poorly in the first matches with the new coach, losing three of the first four with Kåre Ingebrigsten in charge. But the team redeemed themselves by winning nine of the last ten games in the season finishing in 2nd place, eleven points behind Molde. Ingebrigtsen&#x27;s great performance led to him being introduced as the new permanent coach 20 November 2014.

=== Success (2015–2018) ===
Kåre Ingebrigsten&#x27;s first major change was the amount of exercise the players should be susceptible to. He had the same vision as former coach Hansen, but the players had to be able to perform better. During the previous two season, Rosenborg had a tendency to collective collapse in the last ten minutes of matches due to exhaustion. Ingebrigtsen decided therefore that the training would be increased by 40 percent, so that players would be able to finish matches and not let easy goals get scored against. The provision gave results immediately; Rosenborg scored 23 goals and let only two against in their first five pre-season matches.

The season saw Rosenborg win the title again. They made the play-off in the Europa League, beating Debrecen 3–2 in the first leg away in Hungary. As a result of Rosenborg&#x27;s crowd pleasing play, the home spectator numbers increased by 31 percent from 13,922 to 18,239 on average.

At the end of the season Rosenborg won their 23rd title, finishing 12 points clear ahead of the second place Strømsgodset. On 22 November Rosenborg beat Sarpsborg 08 2–0 in the Cup final to win their 10th national cup and complete their 8th domestic Double.

In 2016 Rosenborg won both the league and the cup, and by doing so because the first team in Norway to win the double two consecutive seasons. This was Rosenborg&#x27;s 9th domestic Double.

== Colours and badge ==
The founding members of Rosenborg bought their first kits in 1918. The shirts were blue with a yellow vertical stripe on the front and the shorts were white. The current white shirts and black shorts, introduced in 1931, were another tribute to the football club Odd. A shirt sponsor was introduced in 1971.

Home kit: White shirt and black shorts.

Away kit: Black shirt and black shorts.

Third kit: Red shirt and red shorts.

== Stadium ==
Rosenborg play their home matches at Lerkendal Stadion, an all-seater stadium located at Lerkendal, south of the city center. It has four three-tier grandstands without corners with a capacity for 21,421 spectators, of which 1,338 are in club seating and luxury boxes on the center tier of all four stands. The stadium is part of Lerkendal idrettspark, which also consists of three training pitches, two full size and one which has artificial turf. The club&#x27;s offices are located in Brakka, a German-built barracks dating from World War II.

Lerkendal Stadion opened on 10 August 1947 as the main athletics and football venue in Trondheim, owned by the municipality. Rosenborg took Lerkendal into use from the 1957–58 season. The first major rebuilding of the venue took place ahead of the 1962 season, when the wooden stands were torn and replaced with concrete stands on both long sides, and the south stand received a roof. Floodlighting was installed in 1968 to allow UEFA club tournament matches to be held at the venue. The official all-time record at Lerkendal is 28,569 from the 1985 season league match against Lillestrøm. After the 1995 season, the first part of the current stadium was built to allow for modern facilities for UEFA matches. The short sides were finished in 2001, and the final long stand was completed in 2002. The expansion also saw Rosenborg and private investors purchase the stadium.

<text>The &#x27; (French, ; &quot;Grand Square&quot;; also used in English) or &#x27; (Dutch, ; &quot;Big Market&quot;) is the central square of Brussels, Belgium. It is surrounded by opulent Baroque guildhalls of the former Guilds of Brussels and two larger edifices; the city&#x27;s Flamboyant Town Hall, and the neo-Gothic &quot;King&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;Bread House&quot; building, containing the Brussels City Museum. The square measures and is entirely paved.

The Grand-Place&#x27;s construction began in the 11th century and was largely complete by the 17th. In 1695, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, most of the square was destroyed during the bombardment of Brussels by French troops. Only the façade and the tower of the Town Hall, which served as a target for the artillery, and some stone walls resisted the incendiary balls. The houses that surrounded the Grand-Place were rebuilt during subsequent years, giving the square its current appearance, though they were frequently modified in the following centuries. From the mid-19th century, the square&#x27;s heritage value was rediscovered, and it was thoroughly renovated.

The Grand-Place is the most important tourist destination and most memorable landmark in Brussels. It is also considered one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful squares, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998. The square frequently hosts festive and cultural events, among them, in August of every even year, the installation of an immense &quot;flower carpet&quot; in its centre. It is also a centre of annual celebrations during the Christmas and New Year period, and a Christmas tree has been erected annually on the square since the mid-20th century. This site is served by the &quot;premetro&quot; (underground tram) station Bourse/Beurs (on lines 4 and 10), as well as the bus stop / (on lines 33, 48 and 95).

==Naming==
The toponyms or (French, ; &quot;Grand Square&quot;; also used in English) are generic names designating a central town square, namely in Belgium and Northern France. Originally, the main square was the geographical centre of the towns and cities in these regions (for example the Grand-Place of Mons, Tournai, Arras, or Lille). The Grand-Place of Brussels is the location of the city&#x27;s Town Hall, and thus its political centre. It also housed the largest marketplace in the city (hence its official names or , ; literally meaning &quot;Big Market&quot;, in Dutch).

Nowadays, the names &quot;Grand-Place&quot; (with a hyphen) in French and &quot;Grote Markt&quot; (with one &#x27;o&#x27;) in Dutch are most commonly seen. The historical spellings &quot;Grand&#x27;Place&quot; (with an apostrophe) in French and &quot;Groote Markt&quot; (with a double &#x27;o&#x27;) in Dutch are outdated, but are also still in use in certain sources, such as on wall plaques giving the name of the square. This outdated French spelling is a grammatical exception; &quot;place&quot; being feminine, the modern French form would be &quot;Grande Place&quot;. In the Brabantian dialect of Brussels (known as Brusselian, and also sometimes referred to as Marols or Marollien), the Grand-Place is called &quot;Gruute Met&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
In the 10th century, Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, constructed a fort on Saint-Géry Island, the furthest inland point at which the river Senne was still navigable. The installation of a fort at this point marks the origin of what would become Brussels. By the end of the 11th century, an open-air marketplace was set up on a dried-up marsh near the fort that was surrounded by sandbanks. A document from 1174 mentions this lower market () not far from the port () on the Senne. It was called the (meaning &quot;Lower Market&quot; in Old Dutch) and likely grew around the same time as Brussels&#x27; commercial development. It was also well situated near St. Nicholas&#x27; Church and along the &quot;Causeway&quot; (), an important trade route between the prosperous regions of the Rhineland (in modern-day Germany) and the County of Flanders.

At the beginning of the 13th century, three covered markets were built on the northern edge of the Grand-Place; a meat market, a bread market, and a cloth market. These buildings, which belonged to the Duke of Brabant, allowed the wares to be showcased even in bad weather, but also allowed the Dukes to keep track of the storage and sale of goods, in order to collect taxes. Other buildings, largely constructed of thatch and timber, with some made of stone (), enclosed the Grand-Place. Although none of these remain, their names live on in nearby streets, such as the &quot;Plattesteen&quot;, the &quot;Cantersteen&quot;, or the /. In the middle of the market square stood a primitive public fountain. In 1302, it was replaced by a large stone fountain with eight water jets and eight basins, directly in front of the bread market.

===Rise in importance===
Improvements to the Grand-Place from the 14th century onwards would mark the rise in importance of local merchants and tradesmen relative to the nobility. As he was short on money, the Duke gradually transferred parts of his control rights over trade and mills to the local authorities, prompting them to build edifices worthy of their new status. In 1353, the City of Brussels ordered the construction of a large indoor cloth market (), similar to those of the neighbouring cities of Mechelen and Leuven, to the south of the square. At this point, the Grand-Place was still haphazardly laid out, and the buildings along the edges had a motley tangle of gardens and irregular additions. The city expropriated and demolished a number of buildings that clogged the square, and formally defined its edges.

Brussels&#x27; Town Hall was erected in stages, between 1401 and 1455, on the south side of the Grand-Place, transforming the square into the seat of municipal power. The Town Hall&#x27;s spire towers some high, and is capped by a statue of Saint Michael slaying a demon or devil. To counter this, from 1504 to 1536, the Duke of Brabant ordered the construction of a large Flamboyant edifice across from the city hall to house his administrative services. It was erected on the site of the first cloth and bread markets, which were no longer in use, and it became known first as the &quot;Duke&#x27;s House&quot; (), then as the &quot;King&#x27;s House&quot; (), although no king has ever lived there. It is currently known as the (&quot;King&#x27;s House&quot;) in French, but in Dutch, it continues to be called the (&quot;Bread House&quot;), after the market whose place it took. Over time, wealthy merchants and the increasingly powerful Guilds of Brussels built houses around the square.

The Grand-Place witnessed many tragic events unfold during its history. In 1523, the first Protestant martyrs Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos were burned by the Inquisition on the square. Forty years later, in 1568, two statesmen, Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn, who had spoken out against the policies of King Philip II in the Spanish Netherlands, were beheaded in front of the King&#x27;s House. This triggered the beginning of the armed revolt against Spanish rule, of which William of Orange took the lead. In 1719, it was the turn of François Anneessens, dean of the Nation of St. Christopher, who was beheaded on the Grand-Place because of his resistance to innovations in city government detrimental to the power of the guilds and for his suspected involvement with uprisings within the Austrian Netherlands.

===Destruction and rebuilding===
On 13 August 1695, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, a 70,000-strong French army under Marshal François de Neufville, duc de Villeroy, began a bombardment of Brussels in an effort to draw the League of Augsburg&#x27;s forces away from their siege on French-held Namur in what is now Wallonia. The French launched a massive bombardment of the mostly defenceless city centre with cannons and mortars, setting it on fire and flattening the majority of the Grand-Place and the surrounding city. Only the stone shell of the Town Hall and a few fragments of other buildings remained standing. That the Town Hall survived at all is ironic, as it was the principal target of the artillery fire.

After the bombardment, the Grand-Place was swiftly rebuilt in the following four years by the city&#x27;s guilds and other owners. Their efforts were regulated by the city&#x27;s councillors and the Governor of Brussels, who required that their plans be submitted to the authorities for approval, and fines were threatened against those who did not comply. In addition, the alignments of the buildings were once again improved. This helped deliver a remarkably harmonious layout for the rebuilt square, despite the ostensibly clashing combination of Gothic, Baroque and Louis XIV style.

During the following two centuries, the Grand-Place underwent significant damage. In the late 18th century, French revolutionaries known as the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; sacked it, destroying statues of the nobility and symbols of Christianity. The guilds declined in importance in conjunction with the growing obsolescence of this form of economic organisation and the rise of proto-capitalism. They were abolished in 1795, under the French regime, and the guildhalls&#x27; furniture and archives were seized by the state and sold at public auction on the square in 1796. The remaining buildings were neglected and left in poor condition, with their façades painted, stuccoed and damaged by pollution. The square itself was proclaimed &quot;Square of the People&quot; by a decree of the 30 Ventôse An IV (1795) and a &quot;Liberty tree&quot; was planted on that occasion. At the first hours of Belgian Independence, in 1830, skirmishes occurred on the Grand-Place, which became, for an extremely short time, the &quot;Square of Regency&quot;.

By the late 19th century, a sensitivity arose about the heritage value of the buildings – the turning point was the demolition of the () guildhall in 1853 to widen the street on the left of the Town Hall in order to allow the passage of a horse-drawn tramway. Under the impulse of the city&#x27;s then-mayor, Charles Buls, the authorities had the Grand-Place returned to its former splendour, with buildings restored or reconstructed. In 1856, a monumental fountain commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the reign of King Leopold I was installed in the centre of the square. It was replaced in 1864 by a fountain surmounted by statues of the Counts of Egmont and Horn, which was erected in front of the King&#x27;s House and later moved to the Square du Petit Sablon/Kleine Zavelsquare. Thirty years later, during the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;, a bandstand was raised in its place.

The Grand-Place attracted many famous visitors during that period, among them Victor Hugo, who resided in the () guildhall in 1852, as well as Charles Baudelaire, who gave two conferences at the King&#x27;s House in the 1860s. In 1885, the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party (POB/BWP), the first socialist party in Belgium, was founded during a meeting at the Grand-Place, at the same place where the First International had convened, and where Karl Marx had written &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; in 1848.

===20th and 21st centuries===
At the start of World War I, as refugees flooded Brussels, the Grand-Place was filled with military and civilian casualties. The Town Hall served as a makeshift hospital. On 20 August 1914, at 2 p.m., the occupying German army arrived at the Grand-Place and set up field kitchens. The occupiers hoisted a German flag at the left side of the Town Hall.

The Grand-Place continued to serve as a market until 19 November 1959, and it is still called the (&quot;Big Market&quot;) in Dutch. Neighbouring streets still reflect the area&#x27;s origins, named after the sellers of butter, cheese, herring, coal, and so on. During the 1960s, in a low period of appreciation, the square served as a car parking area, but the parking spaces were removed in 1972 following a campaign by citizens. However, car traffic continued to pass through the square until 1990.

In 1979, the Grand-Place was bombed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). A bomb planted under an open‐air stage where a British Army band was preparing to give a concert injured at least 15 persons, including four bandsmen, and caused extensive damage.

In 1990, the Grand-Place was pedestrianised, a first step in the pedestrianisation of central Brussels, and it is currently part of a large pedestrian zone in the centre of Brussels. The City of Brussels had been thinking about pedestrianising the square and its surrounding streets for several years, but a car park nearby prevented the project from materialising. When its licence ran out in September 1990, the city took the opportunity to conduct a pedestrian experiment. For three-and-a-half months, all traffic was to be banned on the Grand-Place, and also on the adjacent streets. After 1 January 1991, they would decide for good.

The Grand-Place was named by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1998. The place is now primarily an important tourist attraction. A number of guildhalls have been converted into shops, terraced restaurants and brasseries. Notable institutions include Godiva chocolatier and Maison Dandoy speculoos confectionery. One of the houses owned by the brewers&#x27; guild is home to a brewers&#x27; museum. In addition, the Museum of Cocoa and Chocolate (since 2014, Choco-Story Brussels) was founded in July 1998 in the &quot;De Valck&quot; building, at 9–11, /, just off the Grand-Place.

==Buildings around the square==

===Town Hall===

The Town Hall (, ) is the central edifice on the Grand-Place. It was erected in stages, between 1401 and 1455, on the south side of the square, transforming it into the seat of municipal power. It is also the square&#x27;s only remaining medieval building. The Town Hall not only housed the city&#x27;s magistrate, but also, until 1795, the States of Brabant; the representation of the three estates (nobility, clergy and commoners) to the court of the Duke of Brabant. In 1830, the provisional government operated from there during the Belgian Revolution.

The oldest part of the present building is its east wing (to the left when facing the front). This wing, together with a shorter tower, was built between 1401 and 1421. The architect and designer is probably Jacob van Thienen with whom Jean Bornoy collaborated. The young Duke Charles the Bold laid the first stone of the west wing in 1444. The architect of this part of the building is unknown. Historians think that it could be William (Willem) de Voghel who was the architect of the City of Brussels in 1452, and who was also, at that time, the designer of the ; the great hall at the Palace of Coudenberg.

The façade is decorated with numerous statues representing the local nobility (such as the Dukes and Duchesses of Brabant and knights of the Noble Houses of Brussels), saints, and allegorical figures. The present sculptures are mainly 19th- and 20th-century reproductions or creations; the original 15th-century ones are kept in the Brussels City Museum in the &quot;King&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;Bread House&quot; building across the Grand-Place.

The tower in Brabantine Gothic style is the work of Jan van Ruysbroek, the court architect of Philip the Good. Above the roof of the Town Hall, the square tower body narrows to a lavishly pinnacled octagonal openwork. At its summit stands a gilt metal statue of Saint Michael, the patron saint of the City of Brussels, slaying a dragon or demon. This statue is a work by Michel de Martin Van Rode, and was placed on the tower in 1454 or 1455. It was removed in the 1990s and replaced by a copy. The original is also in the Brussels City Museum.

The Town Hall is asymmetrical, since the tower is not exactly in the middle of the building and the left part and the right part are not identical (although they seem so at first sight). According to a legend, the architect of the building, upon discovering this &quot;error&quot;, leapt to his death from the tower. More likely, the asymmetry of the Town Hall was an accepted consequence of the scattered construction history and space constraints.

After various waves of restoration, the interior of the Town Hall has become dominated by neo-Gothic: the Maximilian Room, the States of Brabant Room and their antechamber with tapestries depicting the life of Clovis, the splendid Municipal Council Room, the likewise richly furnished ballroom and the Wedding Room (formerly the courtroom).

===King&#x27;s House===

As early as the 12th century, the King&#x27;s House () was a wooden building where bread was sold, hence the name it kept in Dutch; (Bread House or &quot;Bread Hall&quot;). The original building was replaced in the 15th century by a stone building which housed the administrative services of the Duke of Brabant, which is why it was first called the &quot;Duke&#x27;s House&quot; (), and when the same duke became King of Spain, it was renamed the &quot;King&#x27;s House&quot; (). In the 16th century, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ordered his court architect to rebuild it in a late Gothic style very similar to the contemporary design, although without towers or galleries.

The King&#x27;s House was rebuilt after suffering extensive damage from the bombardment of 1695. A second restoration followed in 1767 when it received a neoclassical portal and a large roof pierced with three &quot;oeil-de-boeuf&quot; windows. It was reconstructed once again in its current neo-Gothic form by the architect between 1874 and 1896, in the style of his mentor Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. On that occasion, Jamaer built two galleries and a central tower. He also adorned the façade with statues and other decorations. At the back, he added a new, much more sober wing in Flemish neo-Renaissance style. The new King&#x27;s House was officially inaugurated in 1896. The current building, whose interior was renovated in 1985, has housed the Brussels City Museum since 1887, in which, among other things, the Town Hall&#x27;s original sculptures are shown.

===Houses of the Grand-Place===
The Grand-Place is lined on each side with a number of guildhalls and a few private houses. At first modest structures, in their current form, they are largely the result of the reconstruction after the bombardment of 1695. The strongly structured façades with their rich sculptural decoration including pilasters and balustrades and their lavishly designed gables are based on Italian Baroque with some Flemish influences. The architects involved in the new development were Jan Cosijn, , , , and .

In addition to the name of the respective guild, each house has its own name. The house numbering starts at the northern corner of the square to the left of the / in a counter-clockwise direction. The most beautiful houses are probably no. 1 to 7 on the north-western side. On the south-western side, between the / and /, are the Town Hall, and the houses no. 8 to 12 to the left of it on the south-eastern side. Still on the south-eastern side, between the / and the /, are the houses no. 13 to 19. On the north-eastern side, the King&#x27;s House, which is located between the / and the /, is to the right of the houses no. 20 to 28 and to the left of the houses no. 34 to 39.


==Events==
Festivities and cultural events are frequently organised on the Grand-Place, such as sound and light shows during the Christmas and New Year period as part of the &quot;Winter Wonders&quot;, as well as concerts in the summer. Among the most important and famous are the Flower Carpet and the Ommegang, both taking place in the summer. The Belgian Beer Weekend, an event dedicated to Belgian beers, during which small and large breweries present their products at the Grand-Place, has taken place since 2010. The square has also been used for community gatherings and public celebrations, such as receiving athletes following sporting events.

===Flower carpet===

Every two years in August, coordinating with Assumption Day, an enormous &quot;flower carpet&quot; is set up in the Grand-Place for three to four days. On this occasion, nearly a million colourful begonias or dahlias are set up in patterns forming a carpet-like tapestry, and the display covers a full , for area total of . The first Flower Carpet was created in Brussels in 1971 by the Ghent landscape architect Etienne Stautemans in an effort to advertise his work, and due to its popularity, the tradition continued in subsequent years. Starting in 1986, the event has been regularly held biannually, each time under a different theme, with the Flower Carpet now estimated to attract between 150,000 and 200,000 local and international visitors.

===Ommegang of Brussels===

Twice a year, at the turn of June and July, the Ommegang of Brussels, a type of medieval pageant and folkloric costumed procession, ends with a large spectacle at the Grand-Place. Historically the largest lustral procession of Brussels, which took place once a year, on the Sunday before Pentecost, since 1930, it has taken the form of a historical reenactment of the Joyous Entry of Emperor Charles V and his son Philip II in Brussels in 1549. The colourful parade includes floats, traditional processional giants, such as Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, and scores of folkloric groups, either on foot or on horseback, dressed in medieval garb. Since 2019, it is recognised as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.

===Christmas tree===

Christmas and New Year celebrations have been held on the Grand-Place every year since 1952 or 1954. They have been officialised since 2000 as part of the &quot;Winter Wonders&quot; in the city centre. A Christmas tree is erected on the square for the occasion and is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony, whilst the square&#x27;s façades are illuminated by a sound and light show. These festivities usually take place from the end of November until the beginning of January and attract a large number of people.

<text>Braxton County is a county in the central part of the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,447. The county seat is Sutton. The county was formed in 1836 from parts of Lewis, Kanawha, and Nicholas counties and named for Carter Braxton, a Virginia statesman and signer of the Declaration of Independence.

In 2010, the center of population of West Virginia was in northern Braxton County.

Important salt works were located at Bulltown and here, in 1772, Captain Bull and his family and friendly Delaware Indians were massacred by frontiersmen. Jesse Hughes helped Jeremiah Carpenter track and kill the Indians responsible for the Carpenter massacre. Jeremiah was a notable fiddle player who wrote a song Shelvin’ Rock about the experience of escaping to rock shelter.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Braxton County was originally divided into four townships: Clay, Franklin, Lincoln, and Washington, which became magisterial districts in 1872. All four districts were renamed in 1873: Clay District became Kanawha, Franklin became Holly, Lincoln became Otter, and Washington became Birch. Two years later, Salt Lick District was formed from part of Kanawha. The two districts were reconsolidated between 1910 and 1920, when the territory of Kanawha District was added to Salt Lick; otherwise they remained stable for the next sixty years. Between 1980 and 1990, the county was reorganized into four new magisterial districts: Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western.

==Politics==
Braxton County, although initially opposed to secession during the first session of the Virginia Secession Convention, later became supportive. Consequently, up until the decline of coal mining unionization, and growing opposition to socially controversial issues, Braxton County was overwhelmingly Democratic. Like all of West Virginia, it has seen an extremely rapid shift to the Republicans over the past five elections.

<text>Tague is an unincorporated community in Braxton County, West Virginia, United States, along the Right Fork Steer Creek. The community took its name from nearby Tague Fork creek. A post office was established in Tague in 1911, but was downgraded as an independent rural station of Frametown. It is believed to be the only location in the United States with that name.

<text>Tromsø Idrettslag is a Norwegian professional football club based in Tromsø. They play their home games at Romssa Arena. Tromsø play in the Eliteserien.

Despite never winning the Eliteserien title, they have finished as runner-up in 1990 and 2011. They have won the Norwegian Cup twice: in 1986 and 1996, and were runner-up in 2012. Their wins make them the northernmost football club in the world to have won a national title. Tromsø has competed in several UEFA competitions: the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, UEFA Intertoto Cup, and UEFA Europa League.

== History ==

=== 1920–39: The pre-war years ===
The club was founded on 15 September 1920, and given the name Tromsø Turnforenings Fotballag (Tromsø Gymnastics Association&#x27;s Football Team), or Turn for short. The first match after the formal foundation was against cross-town rivals IF Skarp, a 0–0 draw. However, it would not take long before success came to Turn, and in 1927, the club won its first district championship.

In 1930, the club changed its name to Tromsø Idrettslag because the Norwegian Sports Association thought the club&#x27;s name was too close to the name of Tromsø Gymnastics Association. However, this was only temporary, and the club changed its name to Tor in 1931. 1931 would also be the year the club won its first Northern Norwegian Cup, the highest possible achievement for a Northern Norwegian club at the time. The club beat Mo IL 3–1 in the final. The year after, the Norwegian Sports Association ruled the club could not be named Tor, and so Tromsø Idrettslag was again chosen, this time permanently. Tromsø also won its second district championship in 1932, but was eliminated in the semi-finals of the Northern Norwegian Cup. The 1930s proved to be a good decade for Tromsø, as the club won district championships in 1933, 1936 and 1937. However, sports activities came to an end in 1940 because of World War II, and the club did not play again before 1945.

=== 1945–1969: Two Northern-Norwegian cup championships ===
Tromsø started the post-war years in a good fashion, winning the club&#x27;s sixth district championship in 1946. In 1949, Tromsø won its second Northern Norwegian cup. This time, the final match was played at Harstad Stadium, and Tromsø were to play FK Bodø/Glimt. Tromsø won 3–1, just like in 1931.

Tromsø then won five consecutive district championships between 1950 and 1954, before the club was introduced into the Norwegian league system (Northern Norwegian clubs could still not be promoted to the top division, however). The club&#x27;s third and last Northern Norwegian cup came in 1956. Tromsø met Harstad IL – the champions of the previous three years – in Harstad, making Harstad the favourites. However, Tromsø won the match 2–0.

Clubs from Northern Norway were allowed into the Norwegian cup in 1963, and Tromsø participated for the first time in 1964, advancing to the second round after beating FK Mjølner. The club was eliminated in the second round by Nidelv IL. The 1960s were also a period of stadium expansions for the club, with both Valhall Stadium and Alfheim Stadium getting grass fields. Because of the inclusion of Northern Norwegian clubs in the Norwegian Cup, the Northern Norwegian Cup was eventually dropped. Tromsø played its last Northern Norwegian Cup match in 1969.

=== 1970–1985: Build-up for the top division ===
With Northern Norwegian clubs accepted in the cup, the only thing left to be included in was the top division. This occurred in 1972, when FK Mjølner moved to the 1. divisjon. However, at the time, Tromsø was fighting in the bottom of the Northern Norwegian 2nd division (Until 1979, the 2. divisjon was divided in three different groups, two southern and one northern – with the winners of the southern groups being promoted to the top division, while the winner of the northern group would have to face the 2nd placed teams of the two southern groups), and was eventually relegated. In 1975, Tromsø would be back in the 2. divisjon after winning promotion the year before. However, the club was once more relegated, this time after only one season in the second highest level of the league system. Tromsø was back in the 2. divisjon in 1978, and won it this time. However, the qualification matches against the two southern teams Hamarkameratene and Fredrikstad FK were lost 3–0 and 1–0 respectively. The next year, 1979, marked the first year with an all-Norwegian 2. divisjon, giving equal chances for all teams, regardless of geographical position. Tromsø did not do too well and was again relegated.

Tromsø was immediately promoted back to the 2. divisjon after not losing a single match in the 3. divisjon in 1980. Then followed relegation in 1981 and promotion in 1982, before the club finally managed to establish itself in the 2nd division. Two decent seasons in 1983 and 1984 were followed by a second-place finish in 1985, which meant the club would again play qualification matches for the top division. First, Sogndal were beaten 1–0. Then, Tromsø won the decisive match against Moss FK 1–0, after a legendary penalty kick save by goalkeeper Bjarte Flem. Tromsø became the third and, for the time being, latest Northern Norwegian club to qualify for the top division, the other two being FK Mjølner and FK Bodø/Glimt.

=== 1986–2001: 16 years in the top division ===
The first season in the top division would be very hard for Tromsø, the club eventually had to play qualification to survive. The club was highly successful in the cup the same year, however, beating top division champions Lillestrøm SK 4–1 in the final match, a match that had been thought to be a walk in the park for Lillestrøm before it was played.

An experiment in the 1987 season proved valuable to Tromsø: tied matches would be decided on penalty shootouts, awarding three points for a win, two for a shootout win, one for a shootout loss and zero for a loss. Thanks to Bjarte Flem&#x27;s exceptional penalty saves, Tromsø won seven out of nine shootouts this year. The experiment was dropped after the season. However, the system with three points for a victory was kept. In 1988, Tromsø ended fifth in the league, the season of Bjarte Flems&#x27; infamous own goal.

The 1989 and 1990 seasons would become the two most successful top division seasons to date, with Tromsø winning a bronze and a silver medals, respectively. The club&#x27;s coach during this time, Tommy Svensson, would eventually coach the Sweden national team to a bronze medal in the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

The following seasons saw Tromsø end sixth, eighth, sixth and seventh (all safe mid-table positions) before the expansion of the Norwegian top flight from 12 to 14 teams in 1995, when Tromsø again ended sixth.

In 1996, ten years after the club&#x27;s first cup championship, Tromsø would again qualify for a cup final. This time, the opponents were FK Bodø/Glimt, which made the final match historical, the first time in history two Northern Norwegian clubs would play each other in a cup final. This also meant that the club winning the match would have bragging rights as the best club in Northern Norway. Tromsø eventually won the match, after a late 2–1 goal by Sigurd Rushfeldt in his last match before leaving for Rosenborg BK. The 1996 cup championship was the club&#x27;s last championship to date. Tromsø also ended 5th in the league.

1997 did not go too well for Tromsø, and after earning only two points during the last seven matches of the season, the club ended 12th in the league and had to play qualification matches to survive. The opponents were Eik-Tønsberg, and Tromsø won 4–0 and 2–1, which meant Tromsø would still be in the top division. Another poor season followed in 1998, but Tromsø avoided qualification matches this time, ending 11th in the league. 1999 saw Tromsø back in the mid-table sections when the club won sixth place, scored 70 goals, and became the first (and only) Northern Norwegian club to have the top scorer of the top division with Rune Lange&#x27;s 23 goals. Tromsø then had one of its best seasons ever in 2000, finishing fourth in the league.

In 2001, Tromsø was relegated from the top division for the first time in history. After two very strong opening wins, the club went on a seven-match losing streak where not a single goal was scored. Tromsø eventually ended last, scoring only 23 goals in 26 matches.

=== 2002–present: Second spell in the top division ===

Tromsø won the 1. divisjon in 2002, and was thus immediately re-introduced into the top division.

Tromsø is the Norwegian top division club that has since 2000 had the highest coach turnover: Terje Skarsfjord (who coached the club during its 1996 cup championship), Tommy Svensson (who made a brief return to the club in 2001 to save it from relegation, after a ten years absence from the club for the Sweden national team), Trond Johansen, Per Mathias Høgmo, Otto Ulseth, Steinar Nilsen and Ivar Morten Normark.

The 2003 season looked as if Tromsø would return to the first division, but they rescued their place in the Tippeligaen by scoring a winning goal three minutes into injury time in the season&#x27;s final match against league champions Rosenborg BK. The arrival of Per Mathias Høgmo before the 2004 season proved to be a success; Tromsø had another good season and finished fourth in the league, which qualified them for the Royal League and, as a result of third-placed team SK Brann&#x27;s victory in the cup that year, the UEFA Cup. After his first successful year, Høgmo opted to forego extending his contract and his former assistant Otto Ulseth was promoted to head coach.

The disappointng 2005 season start had Ulseth sacked after only 15 league matches, all the whiie Tromsø was struggling to avoid relegation. The head coach for the remainder of the season became Ulseth&#x27;s former assistant Steinar Nilsen, who managed to turn Tromsø&#x27;s poor form around. After a club record five consecutive victories, Tromsø secured its place in the Tippeligaen with a 1–0 home win over Viking FK in the second-last matchday of the season. Tromsø also had the top scorer of the top division for the second time in history, as Ole Martin Årst finished the season with 16 goals. The club finished the season in eighth place.

The relegation of FK Bodø/Glimt meant Tromsø were the only team from Northern Norway in the 2006 season. Before the 2006 season, following Steinar Nilsen&#x27;s resignation, Ivar Morten Normark was made the new Tromsø manager. After a rather unsatisfactory start to the season, Tromsø began negotiating to terminate the contract with Normark on 26 July 2006. Until a new coach could be found, former assistant Agnar Christensen acted as head coach. On 4 August, Normark and Tromsø reached an agreement, meaning Normark would leave the club. On 11 August, Steinar Nilsen was appointed coach signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club. Nilsen managed to save Tromsø from relegation once more, leading the club to a tenth-place finish.

Since the end of 2007, Tromsø enjoyed domestic success, with the club finishing inside the league&#x27;s top four on five occasions since the 2008 season. This meant the Tromsø would regularly take part in the qualification rounds for the UEFA Europa League. Built mainly on a strong home record, Tromso finished third in both the 2008 and 2010 seasons, before going one better the next season and finishing runners-up in the 2011 Tippeligaen, five points behind the Champions Molde FK. After a fourth-placed finish in the 2012 season, Tromsø finished 15th at the end of a disappointing 2013 Tippeligaen and were relegated to the 1. divisjon. Spending most of the season in the bottom half of the table, Tromsø finished second last on 29 points, four points from safety. Tromsø were relegated to the 2014 1. divisjon, Norway&#x27;s second tier, before gaining promotion straight back into the top-tier by finishing the season in second place with 59 points, ten points behind champions Sandefjord.

== Recent history ==

== European merits ==

=== 1980s ===
Tromsø first played in a European competition in 1987, following the 1986 cup victory. That time, Tromsø IL met Scottish side St Mirren in the first round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. St Mirren won 1–0 in Scotland and drew 0–0 in Tromsø.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Tromsø IL would try their luck in Europe again, this time in the UEFA Cup. Tromsø met Austrian side Tirol Innsbruck in the first round. A 2–1 loss in Austria (after Stein Berg Johansen had given Tromsø a very early lead after 30 seconds) and a 1–1 tie at home (after a goal by Bjørn Johansen) were the results, meaning Tromsø were again eliminated early.

In 1995, Tromsø participated in the now-defunct UEFA Intertoto Cup, which was played during the summer before the European season starts and gives qualification to the UEFA Cup for the best teams of the tournament. Tromsø played in Group 3, along with Aarau, Germinal Ekeren, Havnar Bóltfelag and Universitatea Cluj. The first match was an away match against Aarau, which ended 2–2. Tromsø then proceeded to beat Havnar Bóltfelag 10–0 at home and Universitatea Cluj 1–0 away. Before the last group match, which was at home to Germinal Ekeren, Tromsø were on top of the group, and a victory would ensure Tromsø&#x27;s advancement to the knockout-stage of the UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, Tromsø lost 2–0 and eventually finished third in the group.

In 1997, the club would again play in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the first round, Croatian side NK Zagreb won 3–2 at home. Tromsø IL were down 3–0, but goals by Bjørn Johansen and Ole Martin Årst gave Tromsø a good result before the home match. The return match in Tromsø ended 3–2, as well, but this time in favour of Tromsø. Rune Lange scored the first goal, but Zagreb equalized before half time. The score was 2–2 after 90 minutes (Ole Martin Årst scored the second goal for Tromsø), and Zagreb looked like they would advance to the second round. However, one minute into injury time, Svein Morten Johansen scored, and extra time would have to be played. Five minutes into the second period, Rune Lange scored the winning goal for Tromsø. It was a historic win, as it was not only the first time Tromsø managed to win a match in a European cup, but also the first time Tromsø managed to qualify for the second round of a European cup. In the second round of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Tromsø would play Chelsea. Tromsø defeated Chelsea 3–2 in the home match (after goals by Steinar Nilsen, Frode Fermann and Ole Martin Årst), which became infamous for the heavy amounts of snow that fell during the match. However, the return match did not go well for Tromsø, who eventually lost 7–1 (9–4 on aggregate). Bjørn Johansen scored Tromsø&#x27;s only goal in London.

=== 2000s ===
In 2005, Tromsø would again play in the UEFA Cup, following their fourth-place finish in the Norwegian top division the year prior. Tromsø won the first qualification match against Esbjerg fB with 1–0 away after a goal by Lars Iver Strand, the club&#x27;s first ever win in an away match in a European cup. Esbjerg won the return leg in Tromsø 1–0, and penalties were needed to decide a winner. Tromsø only converted two of their five initial penalties (Runar Normann and Ole Andreas Nilsen scored), but since Esbjerg also missed three penalties, the teams had to shoot a sixth penalty. Stephen Ademolu scored while Lars Hirschfeld saved Esbjerg fB&#x27;s penalty, and Tromsø advanced.

Tromsø drew Galatasaray in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Tromsø won 1–0 at home after a goal by Tamas Szekeres in the 77th minute, in a match filled with mud, rain and snow. Tromsø tied Galatasaray 1–1 at the feared Ali Sami Yen Stadium, thanks to many important saves by Lars Hirschfeld and a goal in the first half from a shot by Patrice Bernier via Stephen Ademolu. Tromsø thus advanced to the group stage of the cup. This result was seen by many as a huge upset, and some Tromsø fans and players immediately declared it a historic win, likening it to the 1996 Norwegian cup championship and the 1985 promotion.

Tromsø lost the first group match, a home game against Roma. The final score was 2–1, and Ole Martin Årst scored Tromsø&#x27;s goal. The second match saw Tromsø lose again, 2–0 away to Strasbourg. Tromsø won their third match, 3–1 at home against Red Star Belgrade. Benjamin Kibebe scored the first goal, while Årst scored the two last goals. Tromsø lost the last match, against Basel, 4–3, and were subsequently knocked out of the UEFA Cup. Lars Iver Strand scored twice and Årst once. The club ended last in its group.

Tromsø got off to a good start in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League, playing 0–0 away to Dinamo Minsk and then winning 4–1 at home (after two goals by Tommy Knarvik, one by Morten Moldskred, and one own goal) in the second qualifying round. Tromsø played Slaven Belupo in the third qualifying round, marking the second time in history Tromsø played a Croatian club in a European cup. They won 2–1 at Alfheim, after Slaven scored late in the first half. Two goals in the second half within two minutes, the second by a lightly hurt Sigurd Rushfeldt, they won at home, and after 0–2 away, at a tricky home stadium, two goals by Rushfeldt (in the 14th and 81st minutes) won their way and win into the third and last qualifying round of the European league 2009. Now, they will play against one of the historically most successful clubs in Spain, Athletic Bilbao. Sigurd Rushfeldt has played in the Spanish league as a first targeter. Athletic won the first leg in Bilbao 3–2, including one goal from a controversial penalty when the Bilbao player appeared to dive. Another controversial penalty, this time awarded by French referee Tony Chapron, ended Tromsø&#x27;s chances, as they drew the home leg 1–1 and lost 3–4 on aggregate – two of the four goals coming from controversial penalty decisions.

===2010s===
Following the third-place finish in the 2010 Tippeligaen season, Tromsø participated in the Europa League, entering in the first qualifying round of the 2011–12 season. Tromsø&#x27;s first tie was against Latvian club Daugava, which was won comfortably 7–1 on aggregate after winning 5–0 away and 2–1 at home. In the second round, Tromsø were eliminated by Hungarian side Paks.

Tromsø participated in the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League for the second consecutive year, after finishing second in the league in 2011. Tromsø entered the second qualifying round, drawing Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana, winning the tie 1–0 on aggregate after a goal in extra time by Miika Koppinen in the second leg in Tromsø. They then advanced past Metalurh Donetsk of Ukraine in the third qualifying round after a 1–1 draw at home and snatching a rare 1–0 away victory. In the play-off round, Tromsø lost to Partizan. After winning the first match in Tromsø (3–2), Tromsø lost 1–0 in Belgrade and were eliminated on away goals.

Tromsø participated in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League as Norway&#x27;s fair play winner. Tromsø started qualification in the first qualifying round. After beating Celje, Inter Baku and Differdange, Tromsø lost 3–2 on aggregate to Beşiktaş in the play-off round. Tromsø&#x27;s conquerors, Beşiktaş, were then disqualified from the competition by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, meaning Tromsø would replace the Turkish side in the group stage. After being reinstalled back into the competition the Norwegians were drawn in Group K alongside Tottenham Hotspur, Anzhi Makhachkala and Sheriff Tiraspol. Tromsø finished bottom of the group, losing both home and away to Anzhi and Tottenham. Tromsø recorded their only point of the campaign in a 1–1 draw against Sheriff at the Alfheim Stadion.

=== Royal League ===
Tromsø also participated in the first Royal League, which was played in late 2004 and early 2005. Despite playing fairly well, Tromsø ended last in their group, and were eliminated from the cup early.

The official supporter club is called Isberget (&quot;The Iceberg&quot;). Their logo is a polar bear with a football and a red and white striped jersey holding a Tromsø IL scarf. It was founded before the 1996-season and has around 600 members. Members of Isberget can be found in 18 of Norway&#x27;s 19 counties, with the majority living in and around Tromsø. A subgroup founded in 2004, called Isberget Sør (&quot;The Iceberg South&quot;), is for supporters living in Østlandet, and organizes trips to Tromsø&#x27;s away matches in the Østlandet and Sørlandet regions.

Tromsø has a number of songs, with the more famous ones being Heia TIL and the 1996 cup final song, both by Sverre Kjelsberg. The 1996 cup final song is played at Romssa Arena when Tromsø scores a goal. A club fanfare used to be played while the teams entered the pitch during home matches. However, before the 2008 season the NFF decided that all clubs should play Tippeligafanfaren (&quot;The Tippeliga Fanfare&quot;) when the teams entered the pitch. Tromsø now plays its fanfare before Tippeligafanfaren.
