<text>Sippar (Sumerian: , Zimbir) (also Sippir or Sippara) was an ancient Near Eastern Sumerian and later Babylonian city on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Its &quot;tell&quot; is located at the site of modern Tell Abu Habbah near Yusufiyah in Iraq&#x27;s Baghdad Governorate, some north of Babylon and southwest of Baghdad. The city&#x27;s ancient name, Sippar, could also refer to its sister city, Sippar-Amnanum (located at the modern site of Tell ed-Der); a more specific designation for the city here referred to as Sippar was Sippar-Ya·∏´rurum (Sippar-Ja·∏´rurum). The name comes from the Amorite Ya·∏´rurum tribe that lived in the area along with the Amorite Amnanum tribe. In Sippar was the site where the Babylonian Map of the World was found.

==History==

Despite the fact that thousands of cuneiform clay tablets have been recovered at the site, relatively little is known about the history of Sippar. In the Sumerian king list a king of Sippar, En-men-dur-ana, is listed as one of the early pre-dynastic rulers of the region but has not yet turned up in the epigraphic records.
While pottery finds indicate that the site of Sippar was in use as early as the Uruk period, substantial occupation occurred only in the Early Dynastic and Akkadian Empire periods of the 3rd millennium BC, the Old Babylonian and Kassite periods of the 2nd millennium BC, and the Neo-Babylonian times of the 1st millennium BC. Lesser levels of use continued into the time of the Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian Empires.

Sippar was the cult site of the sun god (Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash), along with his consort Aya, and the home of his temple E-babbara (íÇçíåìíåìíäè, means &quot;white house&quot;) where the Cruciform Monument of Manishtushu was found. Mamu, the daughter of Shamash, also had a temple in Sippar as did the goddesses Nin-Isina, Nin·∏´egal, Ninkarrak, and Ta≈°mƒìtum.

In the later part of the 3rd millennium BC, a large coalition of city-states led by Iphur-Kis of Kish (Sumer) and Amar-Girid of Uruk, joined by Enlil-nizu of Nippur, and including the city-states of &quot;Kutha, TiWA, Sippar, Kazallu, Kiritab, [Api]ak and GN&quot; as well as &quot;Amorite [hi]ghlanders&quot; revolted against Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin of Akkad. The rebellion was joined by the city of Borsippa, among others. The revolt was crushed.

During early Babylonian dynasties, Sippar was the production center of wool. The Code of Hammurabi stele was probably erected at Sippar. Shamash was the god of justice, and he is depicted handing authority to the king in the image at the top of the stele. By the end of the 19th century BC, Sippar was producing some of the finest Old Babylonian cylinder seals.

In his 29th year of reign, Sumu-la-El of Babylon reported building the city wall of Sippar. Some years later Hammurabi of Babylon reported laying the foundations of the city wall of Sippar in his 23rd year and worked on the wall again in his 43rd year. His successor in Babylon, Samsu-iluna worked on Sippar&#x27;s wall in his 1st year. The city walls, being typically made of mud bricks, required much attention. The city then came under the control of the Kassite dynasty. In the final years of that dynasty the Elamite ruler Shutruk-Nakhunte (c. 1184 to 1155 BC) captured Sippar. It was held by the Elamites until it was taken by the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar I about 1120 BC. Shutruk-Nakhunte carried back statues from the Shamash temple to Susa adding his own inscription to a stele of the Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin:
In the succeeding Late Bronze Age collapse period, in the reign of Neo-Babylonian ruler Adad-apla-iddina (c. 1064‚Äì1043 BC) the Shamash cult center along with all the other temples in Sippar were destroyed by Suteans and cult symbol of Shamash was lost.

In the early 1st millennium BC, Sippar came under Neo-Assyrian control. After the final defeat of the Neo-Assyrians by the Neo-Babylonians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC text report that a number of Egyptian and Assyrian prisoners were brought to Sippar as chattel. Records of Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BC) and Nabonidos (556-539 BC) record that they repaired the Shamash temple E-babbara.

After the Battle of Opis in September 539 BC Sippar surrendered to the Achaemenid Empire, followed soon after by the fall of the Neo-Babylonian empire.

===Speculation===
Xisuthros, the &quot;Chaldean Noah&quot; in Sumerian mythology, is said by Berossus to have buried the records of the antediluvian world here‚Äîpossibly because the name of Sippar was supposed to be connected with &quot;sipru&quot;, &quot;a writing&quot;. And according to Abydenus, Nebuchadnezzar II excavated a great reservoir in the neighbourhood.

Pliny (&quot;Natural History&quot; 6.30.123) mentions a sect of Chaldeans called the &quot;Hippareni&quot;. It is often assumed that this name refers to Sippar (especially because the other two schools mentioned seem to be named after cities as well: the &quot;Orcheni&quot; after Uruk, and the &quot;Borsippeni&quot; after Borsippa), but this is not universally accepted.

Sippar has been suggested as the location of the Biblical Sepharvaim in the Old Testament, which alludes to the two parts of the city in its dual form.

==Archaeology==
Tell Abu Habba, measuring over 1 square kilometer was first excavated by Hormuzd Rassam (referring to the site as Aboo-Habba) between 1880 and 1881 for the British Museum in a dig that lasted 18 months. Rassam excavated only down to the Old Babylonian levels and was focused mainly on the Neo-Babylonian remains. Tens of thousands of tablets were recovered including the Tablet of Shamash in the Temple of Shamash/Utu. Most of the tablets were Neo-Babylonian. The temple had been mentioned as early as the 18th year of Samsu-iluna of Babylon, who reported restoring &quot;Ebabbar, the temple of Szamasz in Sippar&quot;, along with the city&#x27;s ziggurat.

The tablets, which ended up in the British Museum, are being studied to this day. As was often the case in the early days of archaeology, excavation records were not made, particularly find spots. This makes it difficult to tell which tablets came from Sippar-Amnanum as opposed to Sippar. Other tablets from Sippar were bought on the open market during that time and ended up at places like the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania. Since the site is relatively close to Baghdad, it was a popular target for illegal excavations.

In 1894, Sippar was worked briefly by Jean-Vincent Scheil. The tablets recovered, mainly Old Babylonian, went to the Istanbul Museum. In 1927 archaeologists Walter Andrae and Julius Jordan visited, and mapped, the site. In modern times, the site was worked, mainly soundings, by a Belgian team led by H. Gasche from 1972 to 1973. They determined that Sippar was protected by a wall, partially for flood protection, extending 1200 meters by 800 meters, cutting a trench across it. A tablet of Samsu-iluna was found showing the wall dated back to at least Old Babylonian period though ground water prevented deeper excavation.
Iraqi archaeologists from the College of Arts at the University of Baghdad, led by Walid al-Jadir with Farouk al-Rawi, have excavated at Tell Abu Habbah starting in 1978. Work began with a new site contour map and excavation in the Old Babylonian area in the north where two buildings were uncovered. About 100 Old Babylonian period cuneiform tablets were found. Subsequently, the team worked in an Old Babylonian residential area where terracotta plaques and figurines, and cuneiform tablets were found. The tablets were from the reign of Immerum, Buntahun-ila, and Samsu-iluna. Focus then shifted to the Shamash temple area. In the northeast, Old Babylonian, part of the site, a 30 meter by 5 meter deep sounding was excavated. The sounding found 4 Old Babylonian levels, 2 Akkadian Empire levels, and 3 Early Dynastic levels ( with plano-convex mud brick construction). In 1986, while clearing spoil from the Rassam excavation in the E-Babbar temple, a room was discovered which Rassam had not noticed. It contained a library with about 400 cuneiform tablets, which had been stored in 10 ranks of 17cm by 30cm niches in 4 rows. The tablets included copies of earlier inscriptions dating back to the Akkadian Empire and contemporary texts as late as the reign of Cambyses II. Few of the tablets were published at the time due to conditions in Iraq. With conditions improving, they are now being published. After 2000, they were joined by the German Archaeological Institute. In total, the effort continued in 24 seasons until 2002.

<text>There are a number of disputes concerning the Church of Scientology&#x27;s attempts to suppress material critical of Scientology and the organization on the Internet, utilizing various methods primarily lawsuits and legal threats, as well as front organizations. In late 1994, the organization began using various legal tactics to stop distribution of unpublished documents written by L. Ron Hubbard. The organization has often been accused of barratry through the filing of SLAPP suits. The organization&#x27;s response is that its litigious nature is solely to protect its copyrighted works and the unpublished status of certain documents.

Various critics of the Church of Scientology have characterized the organization as a confidence scam and say that these secretive writings are proof, or that they contain evidence that the organization&#x27;s medical practices are illegal and fraudulent. Scientology has been convicted of fraud in the courts of several nations, although not those of the United States. Others have said that the organization is abusing copyright law by launching lawsuits against outspoken critics.

== Overview ==

Scientology versus the internet was a phrase coined to describe the &quot;war&quot; that the Church of Scientology waged to try to remove their copyrighted materials and secret &quot;advanced technology&quot; from the internet, and to hinder, harass and punish those who used the internet to discuss Scientology and expose abuses. The efforts started in earnest in the 1990s and were effectively abandoned in the late-2000s. Former national spokesman for Scientology Robert Vaughn Young once said, &quot;I am thankful I&#x27;m not having to face the Net. It&#x27;s going to be to Scientology what Vietnam was to the US.&quot;

At first, Scientology operatives attempted to shut down the main online newsgroup about Scientology. Failing that, they tried to overpower it. When insider information started to appear in droves, the organization identified and focused on several key players, had their premises raided, and filed lawsuits against them. Their efforts to suppress speech about Scientology attracted the attention of Anonymous in 2008, who declared their own war against Scientology, called Project Chanology. And finally with the posting of virtually all Scientology materials online, including with WikiLeaks, internally Scientology conceded they had lost the war.

In 1994, Scientology official Mike Rinder was put on the case when the OT Levels appeared on the internet.
According to Tony Ortega, in the 1970s it was easier for Scientology to make scandalous stories disappear. &quot;With limited media outlets to target, Scientology could reasonably expect to control its reputation. Critics could be marginalized or drowned out.&quot; With the internet&#x27;s popularity and mainstreaming, it is more difficult because &quot;the Internet never forgets&quot;. Mark Ebner said that the internet was the undoing of Scientology, starting around 1996: &quot;The Internet pulled back the curtain to find Hubbard bare, and caught the Office of Special Affairs with their pants down ... years later, Anonymous came to Cyber Town and strafed Scientology while they weren&#x27;t looking.&quot; Dave Touretzky, says the Internet still offers &quot;a much-too-convenient source of truth that members turn to when they have doubts about their church&quot;.

== alt.religion.scientology ==
Scott Goehring set up the newsgroup &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; in 1991, partly as a joke, partly for the purpose of informing the public about Scientology. Debate over the pros and cons of Scientology waxed and waned on the newsgroup through the first three years of its existence, and flame wars flared up commonly, as they did on some other newsgroups.

The online battle is generally regarded as having begun with the arrival of Dennis Erlich to &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; in late July 1994. A former high-ranking official in the Scientology organization who had been personally affiliated with L. Ron Hubbard, he caused a number of regular participants in the newsgroup to sit up and take notice.

=== The Xenu revelation ===
On December 24, 1994, the first of a large number of anonymous messages was posted to &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot;, containing the text of the &quot;secret&quot; writings of Scientology known as the &quot;OT Levels&quot; (OT stands for &quot;Operating Thetan&quot;). Included among these postings was OT III (&quot;Operating Thetan Level Three&quot;), which gave L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s description of the &quot;Xenu story&quot;. 

The Xenu story had been published in the Robert Kaufman book &quot;Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman&quot; in 1972, in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in 1977, and several times in the 1980s in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;; nevertheless, this action brought on the actions of lawyers representing Scientology, who contacted various newsgroup participants and posted warnings demanding that the unauthorized distribution of the OT writings cease. The lawyers described the documents as &quot;copyrighted, trademarked, unpublished trade secrets&quot;, and the distribution of the materials as a violation of copyright law and trademark law.

The first postings of the &quot;OT&quot; documents were done through an anonymous remailer, and the identity of the person who made them available on the newsgroup was never discovered. However, Dennis Erlich posted replies to these messages on the newsgroup, and his replies contained the entire text of the original messages (including the disputed materials). Scientology&#x27;s lawyers therefore approached him, declaring that Erlich had re-published the copyrighted works in his newsgroup messages. Erlich&#x27;s reply to this was to deny their requests to remove his postings from the newsgroup.

=== Attempt to remove &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; ===
On January 11, 1995, Scientology lawyer Helena Kobrin attempted to shut down the Usenet discussion group &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; by sending a control message instructing Usenet servers to delete the group on the grounds that:

(1) It was started with a forged message; (2) not discussed on alt.config; (3) it has the name &quot;scientology&quot; in its title which is a trademark and is misleading, as a.r.s. is mainly used for flamers to attack the Scientology religion; (4) it has been and continues to be heavily abused with copyright and trade secret violations and serves no purpose other than condoning these illegal practices.

In practice, this rmgroup message had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when applied to groups that receive substantial traffic, and newgroup messages were quickly issued for those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message resulted in increased public criticism of Scientology by free-speech advocates.

== Raids and lawsuits ==
Shortly after the initial legal announcements and &quot;rmgroup&quot; attempt, representatives of Scientology followed through with a series of lawsuits against various participants on the newsgroup, including Dennis Erlich, in &quot;Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communication Services, Inc.&quot;

The first raid took place on February 13, 1995. Accompanied by Scientology lawyers, federal marshals made several raids on the homes of individuals who were accused of posting Scientology&#x27;s copyrighted materials to the newsgroup. Raids took place against Arnaldo Lerma in Virginia, Lawrence A. Wollersheim and Robert Penny of FACTNet in Colorado, and Dennis Erlich in California. Internationally, raids took place against Karin Spaink in The Netherlands and Zenon Panoussis in Sweden.

In addition to filing lawsuits against individuals, Scientology also sued the &quot;Washington Post&quot; for reprinting one paragraph of the OT writings in a newspaper article, as well as several Internet service providers, including Netcom, Tom Klemesrud, and XS4ALL. It also regularly demanded the deletion of material from the Deja News archive.

Participants in &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; began using quotes from OT III in particular to publicize the online battle over the secret documents. The story of Xenu was subsequently quoted in many publications, including news reports on CNN and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. It became the most famous reference to the OT levels, to the point where many Internet users who were not intimately familiar with Scientology had heard the story of Xenu, and immediately associated the name with Scientology. The initial strikes against Scientology&#x27;s critics settled down into a series of legal battles that raged through the courts. The Electronic Frontier Foundation provided legal assistance to defendant Tom Klemesrud and his attorney Richard Horning helped find Dennis Erlich &quot;pro bono&quot; defense. Daily reports of the latest happenings were posted to &quot;alt.religion.scientology.&quot;

In the wake of the Scientologist actions, the Penet remailer, which had been the most popular anonymous remailer in the world until the Scientology &quot;war&quot; took place, was shut down. Johan Helsingius, operator of the remailer, stated that the legal protections afforded him in his country (Finland) were too thin to protect the anonymity of his users and he decided to close down the remailer as a result.

== Scientology&#x27;s online campaign ==
After failing to remove the newsgroup, Scientologists adopted a strategy of newsgroup spam and intimidation. Scientologists hired third parties to regularly flood the newsgroup with pro-scientology messages, vague anti-scientology messages, irrelevant comments, and accusations that other posters are secret Scientologists intent on tracking and punishing posters. This makes the newsgroup virtually unreadable via online readers such as Google Groups, although more specialized newsreading software that can filter out all messages by specific &quot;high noise&quot; posters make the newsgroup more usable.

While legal battles were being fought in the courts, an equally intense and aggressive campaign was waged online. The newsgroup &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; found itself at the heart of an electronic maelstrom of information and disinformation, as the newsgroup itself was attacked both literally and figuratively. Tens of thousands of junk messages were spammed onto the newsgroup, rendering it nearly unreadable at times when the message &quot;floods&quot; were at their peaks. Over one million sporgery articles were injected into the newsgroup by Scientology management and staff; former Scientology staff member Tory Christman has spoken at length about her involvement in these attacks. Lawyers representing the Church of Scientology made public appeals to Internet service providers to remove the newsgroup completely from their news servers. Furthermore, anonymous participants in the newsgroup kept up a steady stream of flame wars and off-topic arguments. Participants on the newsgroup accused Scientology of organising these electronic attacks, though the organization consistently denied any wrongdoing.

In the early days of the World Wide Web, groups associated with Scientology employed a similar strategy to make finding websites critical of the organization more difficult. Scientology employed Web designers to write thousands of Web pages for their site, thus flooding early search engines. After the advent of modern search engines, this problem was solved by the innovation of clustering responses from the same Web server, so that no more than two results from any one site were shown.
Since 1995, Scientology has used copyright-infringement laws to prosecute critics posting controversial information about the organisation on the Web. The organization has been accused of employing not only legal pressure, but also blackmail and character assassination in an attempt to win many of the court cases in which it involves itself. On the other side of the battle, many Web-page developers have linked the words &quot;Dianetics&quot; and &quot;Scientology&quot; to Operation Clambake. This resulted in the anti-Scientology site having the highest Google index on the term for a while, which in turn resulted in Scientology persuading Google to remove links to the site until international outcry led to the links being restored. This might be considered an early example of a Google bomb, and has led to questions about the power and obligations of Internet search providers.

In the 1990s the Church of Scientology was distributing a special software package for its members to &#x27;protect&#x27; them from &quot;unapproved&quot; material about the organization. The software was designed to completely block out the newsgroup &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot;, various anti-Scientology web sites, and all references to various critics of Scientology. This software package was derided by critics, who accused the organization of censorship and called the program &quot;Scieno Sitter&quot;, after the content-control software net-filter program Cyber Sitter. Since no updates have been reported since 1998 (and the original filter program only worked with Windows 95), the package is unlikely to be in use with recent operating systems and browsers due to software rot.

In June 2006, Scientology lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to Max Goldberg, founder of the website YTMND, asking him to take down all sites that either talked about or mocked Scientology, which had recently become a fad on the site following a popular &quot;South Park&quot; episode. Goldberg responded by stating that the &quot;claims are completely groundless and I&#x27;m not removing anything,&quot; adding to the members of the site, &quot;it should only be a matter of time before we&#x27;re sued out of existence.&quot; In response, YTMNDers created yet more sites about Scientology; these were highlighted on the main page. They also campaigned to Google bomb &quot;The Unfunny Truth About Scientology&quot; site. No legal action was taken against YTMND or Goldberg.

In August 2007, MSNBC quoted Associated Press, in an article on the Wikipedia Scanner, that computers owned by the Church of Scientology had been removing criticism in the Scientology entry on Wikipedia. A Fox News article also reported that Church of Scientology computers had been used to delete references to the relationship between Scientology and the Cult Awareness Network, in the article on the Cult Awareness Network on Wikipedia. In May 2009, the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee decided to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists. A &quot;host of anti-Scientologist editors&quot; were topic-banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had &quot;gamed policy&quot; and resorted to &quot;battlefield tactics&quot;, with articles on living persons being the &quot;worst casualties&quot;.

== Project Chanology ==
In early 2008, another protest against the Church of Scientology was organized by the Internet-based Anonymous, which originally consisted of users of the English speaking imageboard 4chan and forums such as Somethingawful.com, and several Internet Relay Chat channels, among other Internet-based communities claiming affiliation with Anonymous.

On January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Tom Cruise was leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube.
The Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video.
In response to this, Anonymous formulated Project Chanology.
Calling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship, members of Project Chanology organized a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, prank calls, and black faxes to Scientology centers.

On January 21, 2008, Anonymous announced its goals and intentions via a video posted to YouTube titled &quot;Message to Scientology&quot;, and a press release declaring a &quot;War on Scientology&quot; against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center.
In the press release, the group states that the attacks against the organization will continue in order to protect the right to freedom of speech, and to end what they believe to be the financial exploitation of the organization&#x27;s members.
A new video &quot;Call to Action&quot; appeared on YouTube on January 28, 2008, calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008.

On February 2, 2008, 150 people gathered outside of a Church of Scientology center in Orlando, Florida to hold a protest against the organization&#x27;s practices. Small protests were also held in Santa Barbara, California, and Manchester, England.
On February 10, 2008, about 7,000 people protested in more than 93 cities worldwide.
Many protesters wore Guy Fawkes masks inspired by the character V from &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the organization.
Anonymous held a second wave of protests on March 15, 2008, in cities all over the world, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, and Dublin. Anonymous held its third protest against Scientology on April 12, 2008. Named &quot;Operation Reconnect&quot;, it aimed to increase awareness of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s disconnection policy. A fourth protest occurred on May 10, 2008, and a fifth (Operation Sea Arrrgh) occurred on June 14, 2008.

== WikiLeaks ==
In March 2008, WikiLeaks published a 612-page Scientology manual on the eight Operating Thetan levels, considered secret by the Church of Scientology. Three weeks later, Wikileaks received a warning from the Church of Scientology that the manual was copyrighted and that its publication infringed intellectual-property rights. WikiLeaks refused to remove the material, and its operator released a statement saying that Scientology was a &quot;cult&quot; that &quot;aids and abets a general climate of Western media self-censorship.&quot; A Church of Scientology International spokeswoman, writing to FOXNews.com, said: &quot;I can only assume that religious bigotry and prejudice is driving their activity, as there is no altruistic value in posting our copyrighted scriptures, despite WikiLeaks&#x27; statements to the contrary. Posting entire books and hundreds of pages of published works is not &#x27;Sunshine Policy&#x27; but wholesale copyright infringement.&quot; Julian Assange replied: &quot;We thought it was a small issue, and our normal fare is government corruption and military secrets, so it seemed that this nutty religious organization was pretty inconsequential in terms of what we normally do. But after receiving these legal threats from them ... it was time for us to make a stand.&quot;

== Notable legal actions ==
A few of the court cases ended with rulings in favor of Scientology, though most of the cases were settled out of court. Many cases have been criticized as examples of malicious litigation and its members and lawyers have been indicted and fined for such actions. Noteworthy incidents in the later years of the online war included:

* Scientology&#x27;s lawsuit against ex-member Arnaldo Lerma, his provider Digital Gateway, and &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; Lerma posted the Fishman Affidavit that contained 61 pages including the story of Xenu, a story simultaneously denied and claimed as a trade secret by the Church of Scientology.
* Zenon Panoussis, a resident of Sweden, was also sued for posting Scientology&#x27;s copyrighted materials to the Internet. In his defense, he used a provision of the Constitution of Sweden that guarantees access to public documents. Panoussis turned over a copy of the NOTs documents to the office of the Swedish Parliament and, by law, copies of all documents (with few exceptions) received by authorities are available for anyone from the public to see, at any time he or she wishes. This, known as the Principle of Public Access (&quot;Offentlighetsprincipen&quot;), is considered a basic civil right in Sweden. The case, however, was decided against Panoussis. The results of his case sparked a legal firestorm in Sweden that debated the necessity of re-writing part of the Constitution.
* In 1995 Scientology caused a raid on the servers of Dutch Internet provider XS4ALL and sued it and Karin Spaink for copyright violations arising from published excerpts from confidential materials. There followed a summary judgment in 1995, full proceedings in 1999, an appeal in 2003 which has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Netherlands in December 2005, all in favor of the provider and Karin Spaink.
* Dennis Erlich and Scientology settled their lawsuits. Erlich withdrew from the online battle entirely, and all mention of him was removed from Church of Scientology material.
* Activist Keith Henson was sued for posting a portion of Scientology&#x27;s writings to the Internet. Henson defended himself in court without a lawyer, while at the same time he carried out protests and pickets against Scientology. The court found that Henson had committed copyright infringement, and the damage award against Henson was $75,000, an amount which Scientology said was the largest damages ever awarded against an individual for copyright infringement. Henson&#x27;s case became increasingly more complex and ongoing, with a misdemeanor conviction of interfering with religion in Riverside County, California. In his Internet writings, Henson said that he was forced to flee the United States and seek asylum in Canada due to ongoing threats against him.
* Scientology was one of the first organizations to make use of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In June 1999, Scientology used the controversial law to force AT&amp;T Worldnet to reveal the identity of a person who had been posting anonymously to &quot;alt.religion.scientology&quot; with the pseudonym of &quot;Safe&quot;.
*In March 2001, legal threats from Scientology lawyers forced Slashdot to remove text from one of its discussion boards, after an excerpt from OT III was posted there. Slashdot noted this as the first time a comment had to be removed from its system due to copyright concerns, and retaliated by posting a list of links to anti-Scientology websites.
* The organization also used the DMCA to force the Google search engine to erase its entries on the controversial anti-Scientology Web site &quot;Operation Clambake&quot; in March 2002, though the entry was reinstated after Google received a large number of complaints from Internet users. The publicity stemming from this incident led Google to begin submitting DMCA takedown notices it received to the Chilling Effects archive, which archives legal threats of all sorts made against Internet users and Internet sites.
* In September 2002, lawyers for Scientology contacted Internet Archive (archive.org), the administrators of the Wayback Machine and asserted copyright claims on certain materials archived as historical contents of the Operation Clambake site. In response, the Wayback Machine administration removed the archive of the &quot;entire&quot; Clambake site, initially posting a false claim that the site&#x27;s author had requested its removal. A search would return a &quot;Blocked Site Error&quot; from the Wayback archive. The claim has since been removed.

<text>Nergal (Sumerian: d&quot;KI≈†.UNU&quot; or ; ; Aramaic: ‹¢‹∏‹™‹ì‹≤‹†; ) was a Mesopotamian god worshiped through all periods of Mesopotamian history, from Early Dynastic to Neo-Babylonian times, with a few attestations indicating that his cult survived into the period of Achaemenid domination. He was primarily associated with war, death, and disease, and has been described as the &quot;god of inflicted death&quot;. He reigned over Kur, the Mesopotamian underworld, depending on the myth either on behalf of his parents Enlil and Ninlil, or in later periods as a result of his marriage with the goddess Ereshkigal. Originally either Mammitum, a goddess possibly connected to frost, or La·π£, sometimes assumed to be a minor medicine goddess, were regarded as his wife, though other traditions existed, too.

His primary cult center was Kutha, located in the north of historical Babylonia. His main temple bore the ceremonial name E-Meslam and he was also known by the name Meslamtaea, &quot;he who comes out of Meslam&quot;. Initially he was only worshiped in the north, with a notable exception being Girsu during the reign of Gudea of Lagash, but starting with the Ur III period he became a major deity in the south too. He remained prominent in both Babylonia and Assyria in later periods, and in the Neo-Babylonian state pantheon he was regarded as the third most important god, after Marduk and Nabu.

Nergal was associated with a large number of local or foreign deities. The Akkadian god Erra was syncretised with him at an early date, and especially in literary texts they functioned as synonyms of each other. Other major deities frequently compared to or syncretised with him include the western god Resheph, best attested in Ebla and Ugarit, who was also a god of war, plague and death, and Elamite Simut, who was likely a warrior god and shared Nergal&#x27;s association with the planet Mars. It has also been proposed that his name was used to represent a Hurrian god, possibly Kumarbi or A≈°tabi, in early inscriptions from Urkesh, but there is also evidence that he was worshiped by the Hurrians under his own name as one of the Mesopotamian deities they incorporated into their own pantheon.

Two well known myths focus on Nergal, &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot; and &quot;Epic of Erra&quot;. The former describes the circumstances of his marriage of Ereshkigal, the Mesopotamian goddess of the dead, while the latter describes his rampages and efforts of his sukkal (attendant deity) Ishum to stop them. He also appears in a number of other, less well preserved compositions.

==Names and epithets==
Nergal&#x27;s name can be translated from Sumerian as &quot;lord of the big city&quot;, a euphemistic way to refer to him as a ruler of the underworld. The earliest attested spelling is dKI≈†.UNU, with its standard derivative dKI≈†.UNU.GAL first attested in the Old Akkadian period. Since in the Old Babylonian period the cuneiform signs KI≈† and G√åR coalesced, transliterations using the latter in place of the former can also be found in literature. The variant dNIN.KI≈†.UNU, attested in an inscription of Naram-Sin of Akkad, resulted from the use of a derivative of Nergal&#x27;s name, KI≈†.UNU, as an early logographic writing of the name of Kutha, his cult center. 

Phonetic spellings of Nergal&#x27;s name are attested in cuneiform (&quot;dn√©-ri-ig-l√°&quot; in Old Assyrian Tell Leilan, &quot;dn√©-ri-ig-la&quot; in Nuzi), as well as in Aramaic (&quot;nrgl&quot;, &quot;nyrgl&quot;) and Hebrew (&quot;nƒìregal&quot; in the Masoretic Text).

===Meslamtaea and related logograms===

Meslamtaea, &quot;he who has come out of Meslam&quot;, was originally used as an alternative name of Nergal in the southern part of Lower Mesopotamia up to the Ur III period. It has been proposed that it was euphemistic and reflected the fact that Nergal initially could not be recognized as a ruler of the underworld in the south due to the existence of Ninazu (sometimes assumed to be the earliest Mesopotamian god of death) and Ereshkigal, and perhaps only served as a war deity. Meslamtaea with time also came to be used as the name of a separate deity. As attested for the first time in a hymn from the reign of Ibbi-Sin, he formed a pair with Lugalirra. Due to the connection between Nergal and these two gods, who could be regarded as a pair of twins, his own name could be represented by the logogram dMA≈†.TAB.BA and its variant dMA≈†.MA≈†, both of them originally meaning &quot;(divine) twins&quot;. dMA≈†.MA≈† is attested in Neo-Assyrian theophoric names as a spelling of Nergal&#x27;s name, though only uncommonly. However, the god designated by this logogram in one of the Amarna letters, written by the king of Alashiya, is most likely Resheph instead.

===Erra===

From the Old Babylonian period onward the name Erra, derived from the Semitic root , and thus etymologically related to the Akkadian verb &quot;erƒìru&quot;, &quot;to scorch&quot;, could be applied to Nergal, though it originally referred to a distinct god. The two of them started to be associated in the Old Babylonian period, were equated in the Weidner and &quot;An = Anum&quot; god lists, and appear to be synonyms of each other in literary texts (including the &quot;Epic of Erra&quot; and &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot;), where both names can occur side by side as designations of the same figure. However, while in other similar cases (Inanna and Ishtar, Enki and Ea) the Akkadian name eventually started to predominate over Sumerian, Erra was the less commonly used one, and there are also examples of late bilingual texts using Nergal&#x27;s name in the Akkadian version and Erra&#x27;s in the Sumerian translation, indicating it was viewed as antiquated and was not in common use. Theophoric names invoking Erra are only attested from Old Akkadian to Old Babylonian period, with most of the examples being Akkadian, though uncommonly Sumerian ones occur too. Despite his origin, he is absent from the inscriptions of rulers of the Akkadian Empire.

The similarity between the names of Erra and Lugal-irra is presumed to be accidental, and the element &quot;-irra&quot; in the latter is Sumerian and is conventionally translated as &quot;mighty&quot;.

===U.GUR===

The logogram dU.GUR is the most commonly attested writing of Nergal&#x27;s name from the Middle Babylonian period onward. This name initially belonged to Nergal&#x27;s attendant deity (sukkal, and might be derived from the imperative form of Akkadian &quot;nƒÅqaru&quot;, &quot;destroy!&quot;. It has been noted that Ugur was replaced in his role by Ishum contemporarily with the spread of the use of dU.GUR as a writing of Nergal&#x27;s name.

===IGI.DU===
dIGI.DU is attested as a logographic representation of Nergal&#x27;s name in Neo-Babylonian sources, with the reading confirmed by the alternation between it and dU.GUR in theophoric names. However, in a number of Assyrian texts dU.GUR and dIGI.DU appear as designations of two different deities, with the former being Nergal and the latter remaining unidentified. Authors such as Frans Wiggermann and Julia Krul argue it had the Akkadian reading PƒÅlil. However, states this remains unconfirmed. A deity designated by the logogram dIGI.DU was also worshiped in Uruk, with the earliest references coming from the reign of Sennacherib and the most recent from the Seleucid period, and according to Krul should be interpreted as &quot;a form of Nergal&quot;. Paul-Alain Beaulieu instead argues that it is impossible to identify him as Nergal, as both of them appear alongside Ninurta as a trio of distinct deities in Neo-Babylonian sources. According to the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; dIGI.DU could also be used as a logographic writing of the names of Ninurta (tablet VI. line 192; however, a variant lists the sumerogram dG√âSTU instead of dIGI.DU) and the Elamite deity Igi≈°ta (tablet VI, line 182; also attested in Elamite theophoric names). It could also be used to represent the names of Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea. Beaulieu points out that in the Neo-Babylonian period two different deities whose names were rendered as dIGI.DU were worshiped in Udannu, and proposed a relation with Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea. The single attestation of dIGI.DU as a representation of the name of Alammu≈° is an astronomical text is presumed to be the result of confusion between him and Ningublaga, the &quot;Little Twins&quot;, with Lugal-Irra and Meslamtaea, the &quot;Great Twins&quot;.

===Other names and epithets===
Nergal also had a large number of other names and epithets, according to Frans Wiggermann comparable only to a handful of other very popular deities (especially Inanna), with around 50 known from the Old Babylonian period, and about twice as many from the later god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, including many compounds with the word &quot;lugal&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;. For instance, he could be referred to as &quot;Lugal-silimma&quot;, lord of peace. A few of Nergal&#x27;s titles point at occasional association with vegetation and agriculture, namely &quot;Lugal-asal&quot;, &quot;lord (of the) poplar&quot;; &quot;Lugal-gi≈°immar&quot;, &quot;Lord (of the) date palm&quot; (also a title of Ninurta); &quot;Lugal-≈°inig&quot;, &quot;Lord (of the) tamarisk&quot;; &quot;Lugal-zulumma&quot;, &quot;Lord (of the) dates&quot;. However, Dina Katz stresses that these names were only applied to Nergal in late sources, and it cannot be assumed that this necessarily reflected an aspect of his character already extant earlier on. A frequently attested earlier epithet is Guanungia, &quot;bull whose great strength cannot be repulsed&quot;, already in use the Early Dynastic period. An alternate name of Nergal listed in the Babylonian recension of the god list &quot;An≈°ar = Anum&quot;, &quot;de-eb-ri&quot;, reflects the Hurrian word &quot;ewri&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;.
==Character==
Nergal&#x27;s role as a god of the underworld is the already attested in an Early Dynastic &quot;Zame Hymns&quot;, specifically in the hymn dedicated to Kutha, where he is additionally associated with the so-called &quot;Enki-Ninki deities&quot;, a group regarded as ancestors of Enlil believed to reside in the underworld. According to a hymn from the reign of Ishme-Dagan, dominion over the land of the dead was bestowed upon Nergal by his parents, Enlil and Ninlil. He was believed to decide fates of the dead the same way as Enlil did for the living. In one Old Babylonian &quot;adab&quot; song Nergal is described as &quot;Enlil of the homeland (&quot;kalam&quot;) and the underworld (&quot;kur&quot;)&quot;. He was also occasionally referred to as Enlil-banda, &quot;junior Enlil&quot;, though this title also functioned as an epithet of the god Enki.

In addition to being a god of the underworld, Nergal was also a war god, believed to accompany rulers on campaigns, but also to guarantee peace due to his fearsome nature serving as a deterrent. In that capacity he was known as Lugal-silimma, &quot;lord of peace&quot;. He was also associated with disease. As summed up by Frans Wiggermann, his various domains make him the god of &quot;inflicted death&quot;. He also played an important role in apotropaic rituals, in which he was commonly invoked to protect houses from evil. Fragments of tablets containing the &quot;Epic of Erra&quot;, a text detailing his exploits, were used as amulets.

===Astral role===
Nergal was associated with Mars. Like him, this planet was linked with disease (especially kidney disease) in Mesopotamian beliefs. However, Mars was also associated with other deities: Ninazu (under the name &quot;the Elam star&quot;), Nintinugga, and especially Simut, in origin an Elamite god. The name of the last of these figures in Mesopotamian sources could outright refer to the planet (&quot;mulSi-mu-ut&quot;, &quot;the star Simut&quot;).

A number of scholars in the early 20th century, for example Emil Kraeling, assumed that Nergal was in part a solar deity, and as such was sometimes identified with Shamash. Kraeling argued that Nergal was representative of a certain phase of the sun, specifically the sun of noontime and of the summer solstice that brings destruction, high summer being the dead season in the Mesopotamian annual cycle. This view is no longer present in modern scholarship. While some authors, for example Nikita Artemov, refer to Nergal as a deity of &quot;quasi-solar&quot; character, primary sources show a connection between him and sunset rather than noon. For instance, an Old Babylonian &quot;adab&quot; song contains a description of Nergal serving as a judge at sunset, while another composition calls him the &quot;king of sunset&quot;. This association is also present in rituals meant to compel ghosts to return to the underworld through the gates to sunset.

===Iconography===

Nergal&#x27;s role as a war god was exemplified by some of his attributes: mace, dagger and bow. A mace with three lion-shaped heads and a scimitar adorned with leonine decorations often appear as Nergal&#x27;s weapons on cylinder seals. He was also often depicted in a type of flat cap commonly, but not exclusively, worn by underworld deities in Mesopotamian glyptic art.

Bulls and lions were associated with Nergal. On the basis of this connection it has been proposed that minor deities with bull-like ears on Old Babylonian terracotta plaques and cylinder seals might have been depictions of unspecified members of Nergal&#x27;s entourage. An entry in the explanatory god list &quot;An = Anu ≈°a amƒìli&quot; seemingly associates Nergal with chameleons, as his title &quot;Bar-&quot;MU≈†EN&quot;-na&quot;, explained as &quot;Nergal of rage&quot; (&quot;≈°a uzzi&quot;) is like a scribal mistake for &quot;bar-gun3-(gun3)-na&quot; (&quot;the one with a colorful exterior&quot;), presumed to be the Akkadian term for chameleon; Ryan D. Winters suggests that the animal&#x27;s color changing might have been associated with mood swings or choleric temperament, and additionally that it was perceived as a &quot;chthonic&quot; being.

War standards could serve as a symbolic representation of Nergal too, and the Assyrians armies in particular were often accompanied by such devotional objects during campaigns. A similar symbol also represented Nergal on &quot;kudurru&quot;, inscribed boundary stones. 

==Associations with other deities==
The god most closely associated with Nergal was Erra, whose name was Akkadian rather than Sumerian and can be understood as &quot;scorching&quot;. Two gods with names similar to Erra who were also associated with Nergal were Errakal and Erragal. It is assumed that they had a distinct origin from Erra.

Ninazu was seemingly already associated with Nergal in the Early Dynastic period, as a document from Shuruppak refers to him as &quot;Nergal of Enegi&quot;, his main cult center. The city itself was sometimes called &quot;Kutha of Sumer&quot;. In later times, especially in Eshnunna, he started to be viewed as a son of Enlil and Ninlil and a warrior god, similar to Nergal.

Many minor gods were associated or equated with Nergal. The god Shulmanu, known exclusively from Assyria, was associated with Nergal and even equated with him in god lists. Lagamar (Akkadian: &quot;no mercy&quot;), son of Urash (the male tutelary god of Dilbat) known both from lower Mesopotamian sources and from Mari and Susa is glossed as &quot;Nergal&quot; in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;. Lagamar, Shubula and a number of other deities are also equated with Nergal in the Weidner god list. Luhusha (Sumerian: &quot;angry man&quot;), worshiped in Kish, was referred to as &quot;Nergal of Kish&quot;. Emu, a god from Suhum located on the Euphrates near Mari, was also regarded as Nergal-like. He is directly identified as &quot;Nergal of S≈´·∏´i&quot; in the god list &quot;An≈°ar = Anum&quot;, and might be either the same deity as the poorly attested √Çm√ªm (&quot;a-mu&quot;, &quot;a-mu-um&quot; or &quot;a-mi-im&quot;) known from Mari, or alternatively a local derivative of the sea god Yam, possibly introduced to this area by people migrating from further west; Ryan D. Winters notes in the latter case the association would presumably reflect Nergal&#x27;s epithet &quot;lugala&#x27;abba&quot;, &quot;king of the sea&quot;.

Nergal was on occasion associated with Ishtaran, and in this capacity he could be portrayed as a divine judge. However, as noted by Jeremiah Peterson, this association is unusual as Nergal was believed to act as a judge in locations where the sun sets in mythological texts, while on the account of Der&#x27;s location Ishtaran was usually associated with the east, where the sun rises.

===Parents and siblings===
Enlil and Ninlil are attested as Nergal&#x27;s parents in the overwhelming majority of sources, and while in the myth &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot; he addresses Ea as &quot;father&quot;, this might merely be a honorific, as no other evidence for such an association exists.

In the myth &quot;Enlil and Ninlil&quot; Nergal&#x27;s brothers are Ninazu (usually instead a brother of Ninmada), Nanna and Enbilulu. In a single text, a Neo-Babylonian letter from Marad, his brothers are instead Nabu and Lugal-Marada, the tutelary god of this city. However, this reference is most likely an example of &quot;captatio benevolentiae&quot;, a rhetorical device meant to secure the goodwill of the reader, rather than a statement about genealogy of deities.

===Wives and children===
Multiple goddesses are attested as Nergal&#x27;s wife in various time periods and locations, but most of them are poorly defined in known documents. While Frans Wiggermann assumes that all of them were understood as goddesses connected to the earth, this assumption is not shared by other assyriologists.

La·π£, first attested in an offering list from the Ur III period mentioning various deities from Kutha, was the goddess most commonly regarded as Nergal&#x27;s spouse, especially from the Kassite and middle Assyrian periods onward. She received offerings from neo-Babylonian kings alongside Nergal in Kutha. Her name is assumed to have its origin in a Semitic language, but both its meaning and La·π£&#x27; character are unknown. Based on the Weidner god list, Wilfred G. Lambert proposes that she was a medicine goddess. Couples consisting of a warrior god and a medicine goddess (such as Pabilsag and Ninisina or Zababa and Bau) were common in Mesopotamian mythology.

Another goddess often viewed as the wife of Nergal was Mammitum. Her name is homophonous with Mami, a goddess of birth known for example from the Nippur god list, leading some researchers to conflate them. However, it is generally accepted that they were separate deities, and they are kept apart in Mesopotamian god lists. Multiple meanings have been proposed for her name, including &quot;oath&quot; and &quot;frost&quot; (based on a similar Akkadian word, &quot;mamm√ª&quot;, meaning &quot;ice&quot; or &quot;frost&quot;). It is possible she was introduced in Kutha alongside Erra. In at least one text, a description of a New Year ritual from Babylon during which the gods of Kish, Kutha and Borsippa were believed to visit Marduk (at the time not yet a major god), both she and La·π£ appear side by side as two separate goddesses. In the Nippur god list La·π£ occurs separately from Nergal, while Mammitum is present right behind him, which along with receiving offerings alongside him in Ekur in the same city in the Old Babylonian lead researches to conclude a spousal relation existed between them. She is also the wife of Erra/Nergal in the &quot;Epic of Erra&quot;. The Middle Babylonian god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; mentions both La·π£ and Mamitum, equating them with each other, and additionally calls the goddess Admu (&quot;earth&quot;) Nergal&#x27;s wife. She is otherwise only known from personal names and a single offering list from Old Babylonian Mari.

In third millennium BCE in Girsu, the spouse of Nergal (Meslamtaea) was Inanna&#x27;s sukkal Ninshubur, otherwise seemingly viewed as unmarried. Attestations of Ninshubur as Nergal&#x27;s sukkal are also known, though they are infrequent.

According to the myth &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot; he was married to Ereshkigal, the goddess of the dead. In god lists, however, they do not appear as husband and wife, though there is evidence that their entourages started to be combined as early as in the Ur III period. Ereshkigal&#x27;s importance in Mesopotamia was largely limited to literary, rather than cultic, texts.

Nergal&#x27;s daughter was Tadmushtum, a minor underworld goddess first attested in Drehem in the Ur III period. In an offering list she appears alongside La·π£. Her name has Akkadian origin, possibly being derived from the words &quot;dƒÅmasu&quot; (&quot;to humble&quot;) or &quot;dƒÅma≈°u&quot; (connected to the word &quot;hidden&quot;), though more distant cognates were also proposed, including Ge Ωez &quot;damasu&quot; (&quot;to abolish&quot;, &quot;to destroy&quot;, or alternatively &quot;to hide&quot;). It has also been proposed that a linguistic connection existed between her and the Ugaritic goddess Tadmish (or Dadmish, &quot;ddm≈°&quot; in the alphabetic script), who in some of the Ugaritic texts occurs alongside Resheph, though a copy of the Weidner god list from Ugarit however equates Tadmish with Shuzianna rather than Tadmushtum. In Neo-Babylonian lists of so-called &quot;Divine Daughters&quot;, pairs of minor goddesses associated with specific temples likely viewed as daughters of their head gods, the &quot;Daughters of E-Meslam&quot; from Kutha are Dadamushda (Tadmushtum) and Belet-Ili.

While Frans Wiggermann and Piotr Michalowski additionally regard the god Shubula as Nergal&#x27;s son, it is actually difficult to determine if such a relation existed between these two deities due to the poor preservation of the tablet of the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; where Shubula&#x27;s position in the pantheon was specified. Shubula might have been a son of Ishum rather than Nergal. He was an underworld god and is mostly known from personal names from the Ur III and Isin-Larsa periods. His name is most likely derived from the Akkadian word &quot;abƒÅlu&quot; (&quot;dry&quot;). There is also clear evidence that he was regarded as Tadmushtum&#x27;s husband.

===Servants===
Nergal&#x27;s sukkal (attendant deity) was initially the god Ugur, possibly the personification of his sword. After the Old Babylonian period he was replaced in this role by Ishum. Sporadically Inanna&#x27;s sukkal Ninshubur or Ereshkigal&#x27;s sukkal Namtar were said to fulfill this role in the court of Nergal instead. His other courtiers included &quot;umum&quot;, so-called &quot;day demons&quot;, who possibly represented points in time regarded as inauspicious; various minor deities associated with diseases; the minor warrior gods known as Sebitti; and a number of figures at times associated with Ereshkigal and gods such as Ninazu and Ningishzida as well, for example Namtar&#x27;s wife Hushbisha, their daughter Hedimmeku, and the deified heroes Gilgamesh and Etana (understood as judges of the dead in this context). In some texts the connection between Gilgamesh in his underworld role and Nergal seems to be particularly close, with the hero being referred to as &quot;Nergal&#x27;s little brother&quot;.

===Foreign deities===

Resheph, a western god of war and plague, was already associated with Nergal in Ebla in the third millennium BCE, though the connection was not exclusive, as he also occurs in contexts which seem to indicate a relation with Ea (known in Ebla as Hayya) instead. Furthermore, the Eblaite scribes never used Nergal&#x27;s name as a logographic representation of Resheph&#x27;s. According to Alfonso Archi, it is difficult to further speculate about the nature of Resheph and his relation to other deities in Eblaite religion due to lack of information about his individual characteristics. The equivalence between Nergal and the same western gods is also known from Ugarit, where Resheph was additionally associated with the planet Mars, much like Nergal in Mesopotamia. Documents from Emar on the Euphrates mention a god called &quot;Nergal of the KI.LAM&quot; (seemingly a term designating a market), commonly identified with Resheph by researchers. Additionally, &quot;Lugal-Rasap&quot; functioned as a title of Nergal in Mesopotamia according to god lists.

It has been proposed that in Urkesh, a Hurrian city in northern Syria, Nergal&#x27;s name was used to represent a local deity of Hurrian origin logographically. Two possible explanations have been proposed: A≈°tabi and Kumarbi. The former was a god of Eblaite origin, later associated with Ninurta rather than Nergal, while the latter was the Hurrian &quot;father of the gods&quot;, usually associated with Enlil and Dagan. concludes in a recent publication that the identification of Nergal in the early Urkesh inscriptions as Kumarbi is not implausible, but at the same remains impossible to conclusively prove. He points out that it is also not impossible that Kumarbi only developed as a distinct deity at a later point in time. Alfonso Archi notes that it also possible the god meant is Nergal himself, as he is attested in other Hurrian sources as an actively worshiped deity.

In the Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya sanctuary, Nergal&#x27;s name was apparently applied to a so-called &quot;sword god&quot; depicted on one of the reliefs, most likely a presently unidentified local god of death.

The Elamite god Simut was frequently associated with Nergal, shared his association with the planet Mars and possibly his warlike character, though unlike his Mesopotamian counterpart he was not an underworld deity. In one case he appears alongside La·π£. Wouter Henkelman additionally proposes that &quot;Nergal of Hubshal (or Hubshan)&quot; known from Assyrian sources was Simut. However, other identities of the deity identified by this moniker have been proposed as well, with Volkert Haas instead identifying him as Ugur. Yet another possibility is that Emu was the deity meant.

Based on lexical lists, two Kassite gods were identified with Nergal, Shugab and Dur.

In a Middle Assyrian god list, &quot;Kammush&quot; appears among the epithets of Nergal. According to Wilfred G. Lambert it cannot be established whether this indicates an equation with either the third millennium BCE god Kamish known from the Ebla texts, or the Iron Age god Chemosh from Moab.

In late, Hellenistic sources from Palmyra, Hatra and Tarsus Heracles served as the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; of Nergal. Heracles and Nergal were also both (at different points in time) associated with the Anatolian god Sandas.

==Worship==

Nergal&#x27;s main cult center was Kutha, where his temple E-Meslam was located. Andrew R. George proposes the translation &quot;house, warrior of the netherworld&quot; for its name. A secondary name of the E-Meslam was E-·∏´u≈°kia, &quot;fearsome house of the underworld&quot;. It is already attested in documents from the reign of Shulgi, don whose orders repair work was undertaken there. Later monarchs who also rebuilt it include Apil-Sin, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Nebuchadnezzar II. It continued to function as late as in the Seleucid period. In addition to Kutha, Apak (Apiak) is well attested as a major cult center of Nergal, already attested in documents from the Sargonic period. Its precise location is not known, but it has been established that it was to the west of Marad. In this city, he could be referred to as Lugal-Apiak. While absent from Assyria in the Akkadian period, later he rose to the status of one of the most major gods there. Tarbishu was a particularly important Assyrian cult center of both Nergal and his wife La·π£. His temple in this city, originally built by Sennacherib, also bore the name E-Meslam. A third temple named E-Meslam was located in Mashkan-shapir according to documents from the reign of Hammurabi, and it is possible it was dedicated to Nergal too. The veneration of Nergal in this city is well documented. 

Naram-Sin of Akkad was particularly devoted to Nergal, describing him as his &quot;caretaker&quot; (&quot;rƒÅbisu&quot;) and himself as a &quot;comrade&quot; (&quot;r≈´&#x27;um&quot;) of the god. At the same time, worship of Nergal in the southernmost cities of Mesopotamia was uncommon in the third millennium BCE, one exception being the presence of &quot;Meslamtaea&quot; in Lagash in Gudea&#x27;s times. This changed during the reign of Shulgi, the second king from the Third Dynasty of Ur. Theological texts from this period indicate that Nergal was viewed as one of the major gods and as king of the underworld. Tonia Sharlach proposes that &quot;Nergal of TIN.TIRki&quot; known from this period should be understood as the original tutelary god of Babylon. This interpretation is not supported by Andrew R. George, who notes that Nergal of TIN.TIRki is usually mentioned alongside Geshtinanna of KI.ANki, Ninhursag of KA.AM.RIki, and other deities worshiped in settlements located in the proximity of Umma, and on this basis he argues that this place name should be read phonetically as Tintir and refers to a small town administered directly from said city, and not to Babylon, whose name could be written logographically as TIN.TIRki in later periods. Other authors agree that the worship of Nergal is well attested in the area around Umma. George additionally points out that there is no indication that Babylon was regarded as a major cult center of Nergal in any time period. 

In the Old Babylonian period Nergal continued to be worshiped as a god of the dead, as indicated for example by an elegy in which he appears alongside Ningishzida, Etana and Bidu, the gatekeeper of the underworld. He appears for the first time in documents from Uruk in this period. Anam of Uruk built a temple dedicated to him in nearby Uzurpara during the reign of S√Æn-gƒÅmil. It is possible that it bore the name E-dimgalanna, &quot;house, great bond of heaven&quot;. Multiple temples of other deities (Sud, Aya and Nanna) bearing the same name are attested from other locations as well. Damiq-ilishu of Isin also built a temple of Nergal in this location, the E-kitu≈°bidu, &quot;house whose abode is pleasant&quot;. In Uruk itself, Nergal had a small sanctuary, possibly known as E-meteirra, &quot;house worthy of the mighty one&quot;. A temple bearing this name was rebuilt by Kudur-Mabuk at one point. Nergal continued to be worshiped in Uruk as late as in early Achaemenid times, and he is mentioned in a source from the 29th year of the reign of Darius I. One late document mentions an oath taken in the presence of a priest (&quot;sanga&quot;) of Nergal during the sale of a prebend in which Nergal and Ereshkigal were invoked as divine witnesses.

Ancient lists of temples indicate that a temple of Nergal bearing the name E-≈°ahulla, &quot;house of the happy heart&quot;, was located in M√™-Turan. It was identified during excavations based on brick inscriptions and votive offerings dedicated to Nergal. It shared its name with a temple of Nanaya located in Kazallu. According to Andrew R. George, its name was most likely a reference to the occasional association between Nergal and joy. For example, a street named &quot;the thoroughfare of Nergal of Joy&quot; (Akkadian: &quot;m≈´taq Nergal ≈°a ·∏´ad√™&quot;) existed in Babylon, while the god list &quot;An = Anum ≈°a amƒìli&quot; mentions &quot;Nergal of jubilation&quot; (dU.GUR &quot;≈°a ri≈°ati&quot;).

In Lagaba, Nergal was worshiped under the name I≈°ar-kidi≈°≈°u. He could also be referred to as the tutelary god of Marad, though this city was chiefly associated with Lugal-Marada. Offerings or other forms of worship are also attested from Dilbat, Isin, Larsa, Nippur and Ur. It is possible that a temple of Nergal bearing the name E-erim·∏´a≈°·∏´a≈°, &quot;house which smites the wicked&quot;, which was at one point rebuilt by Rim-S√Æn I, was located in the last of these cities. Temples dedicated to him also existed in both Isin and Nippur, but their names are not known. 

In the Neo-Babylonian period Nergal was regarded as the third most important god in the Babylonian state pantheon after Marduk and Nabu. These three gods often appear together in royal inscriptions. Based on a cylinder of Neriglissar providing for E-Meslam in Kutha was regarded as a royal duty, similar as in the case of Marduk&#x27;s and Nabu&#x27;s main temples (respectively E-Sagil in Babylon and E-Zida in Borsippa). However, administrative documents indicate that Nergal and his wife La·π£ received fewer offerings than Marduk or Nabu. In some families it was seemingly customary to give the third son a theophoric name invoking Nergal, in accordance with his position in the state pantheon.

14th and 28th days of the month were regarded as sacred to Nergal, as was the number 14 itself, though it was also associated with Sakkan.

Unlike other Mesopotamian deities associated with the underworld (for example Ereshkigal), Nergal is well attested in theophoric names.

===Hurrian reception===

Nergal was also incorporated into the pantheon of the Hurrians, and it has been argued he was among the earliest foreign gods they have adopted. He is one of the gods considered to be &quot;pan-Hurrian&quot; by modern researchers, a category also encompassing the likes of Teshub, Shaushka or Nupatik. He is already attested in the inscriptions of two early Hurrian kings of Urkesh, Tish-atal and Atal-shen. An inscription of the former is the oldest known text in Hurrian:

The sun god and the weather god in this inscription are most likely Hurrian Shimige and Teshub.

Atal-shen referred to Nergal as the lord of a location known as Hawalum:

Giorgio Buccellati in his translation quoted above renders the names of the other deities invoked as Shamash and Ishtar, but according to Alfonso Archi the logograms dUTU and dINANNA should be read as Shimige and Shaushka in this case.

The worship of Nergal is also well attested in the eastern Hurrian settlements. These include Arrapha, referred to as the &quot;City of the Gods&quot;, which was located near modern Kirkuk, as well as ·∏™ilamani, Tilla and Ulamme, where an &quot;entu&quot; priestess dedicated to him resided. In the last three of these cities, he was associated with a goddess referred to as &quot;dI≈†TAR ·∏™umella&quot;, the reading and meaning of whose name are unclear.

==Mythology==
===&quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot;===
Two versions of the myth &quot;Nergal and Ereshkigal&quot; are known, one from a single Middle Babylonian copy found in Amarna, seemingly copied by a scribe whose native language was not Akkadian and another known from Sultantepe and from Uruk, with copies dated to the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, respectively. The time of original composition is uncertain, with proposed dates varying from Old Babylonian to Middle Babylonian times. Whether a Sumerian original existed is unknown, and the surviving copies are all written in Akkadian.

After Nergal fails to pay respect to Ereshkigal&#x27;s sukkal Namtar during a feast where he acts as a proxy of his mistress, who cannot leave the underworld to attend, she demands to have him sent to the underworld to answer for it. The El Amarna version states that she planned to kill Nergal, but this detail is absent from the other two copies.

Nergal descends to the underworld, but he&#x27;s able to avoid many of its dangers thanks to advice given to him by Ea. However, he ignores one of them, and has sex with Ereshkigal. After six days he decides to leave while Ereshkigal is asleep. After noticing this she dispatches Namtar, and demands the other gods to convince Nergal to return again, threatening to open the gates of the underworld if she does not get what she asks for. Nergal is handed over to her again.

In the Amarna version, where Ereshkigal initially planned to kill Nergal, he defeats Namtar and prepares to kill Ereshkigal. To save herself, she suggests that they can get married and share the underworld. The other two known copies give the myth a happy ending: as noted by assyriologist Alhena Gadotti, &quot;the two deities seem to reunite and live happily ever after&quot;, and the myth concludes with the line &quot;they impetuously entered the bedchamber&quot;.

According to assyriologists such as Stephanie Dalley the purpose of this narrative was most likely to find a way to reconcile two different views of the underworld, one from the north centered on Nergal, and another from the south centered on Ereshkigal. Tikva Frymer-Kensky&#x27;s attempt at interpreting it as evidence of &quot;marginalization of goddesses&quot; is regarded as erroneous. According to Alhena Gadotti the idea that Ereshkigal was supposed to share kingship over the underworld with her spouse is also known from the Old Babylonian composition &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Underworld&quot;, in which Anu and Enlil give the underworld to her &quot;as a dowry, her portion of the paternal estate&#x27;s inheritance, which she controlled until she married&quot;. It is however impossible to tell which of the three gods regarded as Ereshkigal&#x27;s husbands in various sources was implicitly meant to be the recipient of the dowry in this composition‚ÄîGugalanna, Nergal, or Ninazu.

===&quot;Epic of Erra&quot;===
The oldest surviving copies of the &quot;Epic of Erra&quot; come from the Assyrian city of Nineveh and have been dated to the seventh century BCE, but it has been argued that the composition is between 100 and 400 years older than that based on possible allusions to historical events which occurred during a period of calamity which Babylonia experienced roughly between eleventh and eighth centuries BCE. A colophon indicates that it was compiled by a certain Kabti-ilani-Marduk, which constitutes an uncommon of example of a direct statement of authorship of an ancient Mesopotamian text.

Nergal (the names Nergal and Erra are both used to refer to the protagonist of the narrative) desires to wage war to counter a state of inertia he found himself in. His weapons (the Sebitti) urge him to take action, while his sukkal Ishum, who according to Andrew R. George appears to play the role of Nergal&#x27;s conscience in this myth, attempts to stop him. Nergal dismisses the latter, noting that it is necessary to regain respect in the eyes of humans, and embarks on a campaign.
His first goal is Babylon. Through trickery he manages to convince Marduk (portrayed as a ruler past his prime, rather than as a dynamic hero, in contrast with other compositions) to leave his temple. However, Marduk returns too soon for Nergal to successfully start his campaign, and as a result in a long speech he promises to give other gods a reason to remember him. As a result of his declaration (or perhaps because of Marduk&#x27;s temporary absence), the world seemingly finds itself in a state of cosmic chaos.

Ishum once again attempts to convince Nergal to stop, but his pleading does not accomplish its goal. Nergal&#x27;s acts keep escalating and soon Marduk is forced to leave his dwelling again, fully leaving the world at Nergal&#x27;s mercy. A number of graphic descriptions of the horrors of war focused on nameless humans suffering because of Nergal&#x27;s reign of terror follow. This is still not enough, and he declares his next goal is to destroy the remaining voices of moderation, and the cosmic order as a whole.

However, Ishum eventually manages to bring an end to the bloodshed. He does so by waging a war himself, targeting the inhabitants of Mount Sharshar, seemingly a site associated with the origin of the aforementioned period of chaos in the history of late second and early first millennium BCE Babylonia. Ishum&#x27;s war is described in very different terms to Nergal&#x27;s, and with its end the period of instability comes to a close. Nergal is seemingly content with the actions of his sukkal and with hearing the other gods acknowledge the power of his rage. The narrative ends with Nergal instructing Ishum to spread the tale of his rampage, but also to make it clear that only thanks to his calming presence the world was spared.

===Other myths===
A poorly preserved Middle Assyrian composition, regarded as similar to the Labbu myth, seemingly describes a battle between Nergal (possibly acting on behalf of his father Enlil or the sky god Anu) and a monstrous serpent born in the sea.

The myth &quot;Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, only known from a single, heavily damaged copy from the Seleucid or Parthian period, casts Nergal as the warden of the eponymous antagonist and his seven sons, the Sebitti, presumably imprisoned in the underworld. In the surviving fragments Enmesharra unsuccessfully pleads with him to be released to avoid being put to death for his crimes at the orders of Marduk. In the aftermath of the ordeal, the universe is reorganized and Marduk shares lordship over it, which seemingly originally belonged to Anu in this composition, with Nergal and Nabu. Wilfred G. Lambert notes these gods were the 3 most prominent deities in the neo-Babylonian state pantheon. Curiously, Erra makes a brief appearance as a god distinct from Nergal, with his former sphere of influence reassigned to the latter.

Andrew R. George proposes that a myth presently unknown from textual records dealt with Nergal&#x27;s combat with a one-eyed monster, the &quot;igitel√ª&quot;. He notes that Akkadian omen texts from Susa and from the Sealand archives appears to indicate that one-eyed creatures were known as &quot;igidalu&quot;, &quot;igidaru&quot; or &quot;igitel√ª&quot;, possibly a loanword from Sumerian &quot;igi.dili&quot; (&quot;one eye&quot;), and that the only god associated with them was Nergal, who in one such omen texts is identified as the slayer of an igitel√ª. There is also evidence that birth of one-eyed animals was regarded as an omen connected to Nergal. He proposes that a relief originally excavated in Khafajah (ancient Tubub) depicting a god stabbing a one-eyed monster with rays of light emenating from his head might be a pictorial representation of this hypothetical myth, though other interpretations have been proposed too, including Marduk killing Tiamat and Ninurta killing Asag. However, neither of these found widespread support, and art historian Anthony Green in particular showed skepticism regarding them, noting art might preserve myths not known from textual record. Wilfred G. Lambert suggested that the cyclops in mention might instead be a depiction of Enmesharra, based on his description as a luminous deity in Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat.

==Later relevance==
Nergal is mentioned in the Book of Kings as the deity of the city of Cuth (Kutha): &quot;And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal&quot; (2 Kings, 17:30). According to the rabbinic tradition, he was associated with the image of a foot or a rooster.

In Mandaean cosmology, the name for Mars is &quot;Nirig&quot; (), a derivative of Nergal, which is a part of a recurrent pattern of Mandaean names of celestial bodies being derived from names of Mesopotamian deities.

Victorian lexicographer E. Cobham Brewer asserted that the name of Nergal, who he identified as &quot;the most common idol of ancient Phoenicians, Indians and Persians&quot;, meant &quot;dunghill cock&quot;. This translation is incorrect in the light of modern research, as Nergal&#x27;s name most likely was understood as &quot;Lord of the big city&quot;, his emblematic animals were bulls and lions, while chickens were unknown in Mesopotamia prior to the ninth century BCE based on archeological data, and left behind no trace in cuneiform sources.

<text>Moledet () was a minor right-wing to far-right political party in Israel.

==History==
Moledet was established by Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi in 1988. It won two seats in the Knesset elections later that year, taken by Ze&#x27;evi and Yair Sprinzak. It joined Yitzhak Shamir&#x27;s government in February 1991 and Ze&#x27;evi was appointed Minister without Portfolio. However, he resigned from the cabinet on 21 January the following year. In the 1992 elections, the party won three seats, with Yosef Ba-Gad and Shaul Gutman joining Ze&#x27;evi in the Knesset. However, Gutman left the party to establish Yamin Yisrael on 27 July 1995, whilst Ba-Gad left to sit as an independent on 12 March 1996.

The party won two seats in the 1996 elections, taken by Ze&#x27;evi and Binyamin Elon, and supported Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s government, although it did not join it. On 4 March 1999, the party gained a third MK when Moshe Peled left Tzomet to found Mehora, which he immediately merged into Moledet. Prior to the 1999 elections, the party joined the National Union alliance alongside Herut ‚Äì The National Movement and Tkuma. The Union won four seats, with two taken by Moledet members Elon and Ze&#x27;evi. The alliance joined the government formed by Ariel Sharon on 7 March 2001 after he won the election for Prime Minister, and Ze&#x27;evi was appointed Minister of Tourism. However, he was assassinated by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) on 17 October 2001, and his seat taken by Uri Ariel of Tkuma. Elon was elected party leader and assumed Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s place in the cabinet until 14 March 2002.

Prior to the 2006 elections, the National Union formed an alliance with the National Religious Party, which went on to win nine seats; Moledet again held two seats, taken by Elon and Eldad. On 3 November 2008 the party announced a merger with other members of the National Union, the National Religious Party and Tkuma to form a new right-wing party, later named the Jewish Home. However, the Jewish Home excluded ex-Moledet members from the top slots of the candidate list for the 2009 elections. Moledet then rejected the merger and joined the revived National Union. Although the Union won four seats, the highest place Moledet candidate was fifth-placed Uri Bank, who failed to enter the Knesset.

In the lead up to the 2013 elections, Tkuma merged with the Jewish Home. Bank supported the merger and allowed Tkuma to continue using the letter &#x27;Tet&#x27; on the ballot.

==Ideology==
The party advocated encouraging voluntary population transfer (as opposed to forced transfer) of the Arab population of the West Bank. While other parties, namely Kach and Herut, also advocated transfer, Moledet was the party most associated with the concept in Israel, given the dearth of other elements in its platform and Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s success in bringing together opposing political elements‚Äîboth secular and religious‚Äîunder the transfer flag. In contrast to Kach and the ideas of Meir Kahane, Moledet advocated only voluntary transfer.

<text>Mater Matuta was an indigenous Latin goddess, whom the Romans eventually made equivalent to the dawn goddess Aurora and the Greek dawn goddess Eos.
Mater Matuta was the goddess of female maturation, and later became linked to the dawn. Her cult is attested to in several places in Latium; her most famous temple was located at Satricum.

== Temples ==
Mater Matuta had a temple in the capital city of Rome, on the north side of the Forum Boarium, mentioned in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;. The sixth king of Rome, Servius Tullius, was thought to have personally consecrated the temple in the 6th century BCE. It was destroyed in 506 BCE and rebuilt by Marcus Furius Camillus in 396¬†BCE. The temple was associated with the Matralia festival. It was situated beside the temple of Fortuna, later discovered under the church of Sant&#x27; Omobono.

A temple located at Satricum is described in literature by Roman historian Livy. The earliest evidence of temple activity is dated simultaneously with votive deposits dating to the sixth century¬†BCE. A second temple, larger and made of stone, replaced the first. In the another yet even larger temple was constructed. The temple was struck by lightning in 206¬†BCE. Excavation of thousands of objects has been itemized and recorded; vessels to eat and drink, statuettes, anatomical votives, and domestic animal votives. Votive material indicative of both male and female worship is attributed to this site.

A temple in Campania, outside modern Capua, yielded dozens of votive statues representing &quot;matres matutae&quot;, found in the &quot;Fondo Patturelli,&quot; a private estate. The site was severely damaged by unprofessional excavations in 1845 and 1873, executed by the Paturelli family, who owned the land. The family took it upon themselves to recover artifacts and then sold them for personal gain. In order to conceal their illicit activity, the family terminated the excavation, but not before they damaged the temple site. Eventually, a multitude of statues and valuables were recovered. An extensive collection of these votives is housed in the Museo Campano in Capua.

== Relationships with other deities ==
Mater Matuta is associated with Fortuna, due to the closeness of their temples in Rome and the dates of their festivals. Because her temple at Pyrgi is located next to a port, she was associated with the sea. By the Roman Imperial period, Mater Matuta was linked with the Greek goddess Leucothea, previously known as Ino, an ancient sea goddess. Statuettes at Satricum depicted a female figure with a solar disc behind her head an iconographic detail similar to representations of other goddesses, such as Uni in Etruria and the Phoenician Astarte.

== Matralia ==
At Rome, Mater Matuta&#x27;s festival was the Matralia, celebrated on June 11 at her temple in the Forum Boarium. The festival was only for single women or women in their first marriage (univirae), who offered prayers for their nephews and nieces. The crowning of garlands on the deity&#x27;s image was for these revelers. Another aspect of the festival was eating specially prepared cakes. Notably, a singular female slave participated in a ritual whereupon the woman was beaten and driven from the area by the freeborn women.

In book VI (June) of the &quot;Fasti&quot;, Ovid describes the ancient festival in some detail:

&quot;Go, good mothers (the Matralia is your festival), and offer to the Theban goddess the yellow cakes that are her due. Adjoining the bridges and the great Circus is an open space of far renown, which takes its name from the statue of an ox there, on this day, it is said, Servius consecrated with his own sceptered hands a temple of Mother Matuta. Who the goddess is, why she excludes (for exclude she does) female slaves from the threshold of her temple, and why she calls for toasted cakes.&quot;

<doc id="85490" wikidata="Q730249" url="?curid=85490" title="Arsenic poisoning">
<text>Arsenic poisoning (or arsenicosis) is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body. If arsenic poisoning occurs over a brief period of time, symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and watery diarrhea that contains blood. Long-term exposure can result in thickening of the skin, darker skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heart disease, numbness, and cancer.

The most common reason for long-term exposure is contaminated drinking water. Groundwater most often becomes contaminated naturally; however, contamination may also occur from mining or agriculture. It may also be found in the soil and air. Recommended levels in water are less than 10‚Äì50¬†Œºg/L (10‚Äì50 parts per billion). Other routes of exposure include toxic waste sites and pseudo-medicine. Most cases of poisoning are accidental. Arsenic acts by changing the functioning of around 200 enzymes. Diagnosis is by testing the urine, blood, or hair.

Prevention is by using water that does not contain high levels of arsenic. This may be achieved by the use of special filters or using rainwater. There is not good evidence to support specific treatments for long-term poisoning. For acute poisonings treating dehydration is important. Dimercaptosuccinic acid or dimercaptopropane sulfonate may be used while dimercaprol (BAL) is not recommended. Hemodialysis may also be used.

Through drinking water, more than 200 million people globally are exposed to higher-than-safe levels of arsenic. The areas most affected are Bangladesh and West Bengal. Exposure is also more common in people of low income and minorities. Acute poisoning is uncommon. The toxicity of arsenic has been described as far back as 1500 BC in the Ebers papyrus.
==Signs and symptoms==
Ingesting large amounts of arsenic can cause symptoms similar to food poisoning, with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea starting within hours. Bloody diarrhea can cause severe fluid loss, resulting in hypovolemic shock. The heart and nervous system can also be affected, causing disruption to heart rhythms (QT interval prolongation or tachycardia), heart failure, confusion, seizures, brain swelling, coma, and death. Inhaling arsine gas ‚Äì the most toxic form of arsenic ‚Äì causes a multisystem disease starting 2 to 24 hours after inhalation. Symptoms include gastrointestinal distress, headache, weakness, difficulty breathing, kidney and liver dysfunction, and the destruction of red blood cells.

Chronic ingestion of lower levels of arsenic causes visible changes in the skin, typically hyperpigmentation (dark areas), but sometimes hypopigmentation (light areas) or an alternating areas of each. Some experience general thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of the feet, or small thickened areas. Around 5% of those affected develop light-colored bands across the fingernail, called Mees&#x27; lines. Chronic exposure eventually causes disease across multiple body systems, including peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling), enlargement of the liver and spleen, diabetes, heart disease, cognitive impairment, and damage to the portal vein (non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis and portal hypertension).

Repeated arsenic exposure also increases the risk for developing several cancers, particularly of the skin, lung, liver, bladder, prostate, and blood vessels. The most common arsenic-induced skin cancer is squamous cell carcinoma in situ which typically occurs 2 to 20 years after arsenic exposure.

==Causes==
Arsenic poisoning is caused by incidental ingestion or inhalation of arsenic, typically from drinking contaminated well water, eating food cooked in contaminated water, or being exposed to arsenic-containing pesticides, folk medicines, or industrial chemicals. The World Health Organization considers arsenic levels above 10 parts per billion (10 micrograms per liter) to be unsafe.

=== Sources ===

Arsenic is a ubiquitous naturally occurring chemical element, and the 20th most common element on Earth. Arsenic levels in the groundwater vary from around 0.5 parts per billion to 5000 parts per billion, depending on an area&#x27;s geologic features, and possible presence on industrial waste. The highest groundwater arsenic levels have been recorded in Brazil, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Australia, and Bangladesh.

Arsenic is a ubiquitous element present in American drinking water. In the US, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the median groundwater concentration is 1¬†Œºg/L or less, although some groundwater aquifers, particularly in the western United States, can contain much higher levels. For example, median levels in Nevada were about 8¬†Œºg/L but levels of naturally occurring arsenic as high as 1000¬†Œºg/L have been measured in the United States in drinking water. Groundwater associated with volcanics in California contain As at concentrations ranging up to 48,000 Œºg/L, with As-bearing sulfide minerals as the main source. Geothermal waters on Dominica in the Lesser Antilles also contain concentrations of As &gt;50 Œºg/L. In Wisconsin, As concentrations of water in sandstone and dolomite aquifers were as high as 100¬†Œºg/L. Oxidation of pyrite hosted by these formations was the likely source of the As. In the Piedmont of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, groundwater in Mesozoic age aquifers contains elevated levels of As‚Äîdomestic well waters from Pennsylvania contained up to 65¬†Œºg/L, whereas in New Jersey the highest concentration measured recently was 215¬†Œºg/L.

Organic arsenic is less harmful than inorganic arsenic. Seafood is a common source of the less toxic organic arsenic in the form of arsenobetaine. Because of its high toxicity, arsenic is seldom used in the Western world, although in Asia it is still a popular pesticide. Arsenic is mainly encountered occupationally in the smelting of zinc and copper ores.

In the United States, Schoof et al. estimated an average adult intake of 3.2¬†Œºg/day, with a range of 1‚Äì20¬†Œºg/day. Estimates for children were similar. Food also contains many organic arsenic compounds. The key organic arsenic compounds that can be routinely found in food (depending on food type) include monomethylarsonic acid (MMAsV), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAsV), arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, arsenosugars, and arsenolipids. DMAsV or MMAsV can be found in various types of fin fish, crabs, and mollusks, but often at very low levels.

Arsenobetaine is the major form of arsenic in marine animals, and is considered nontoxic. Arsenocholine, which is mainly found in shrimp, is chemically similar to arsenobetaine, and is considered to be &quot;essentially nontoxic&quot;. Although arsenobetaine is little studied, available information indicates it is not mutagenic, immunotoxic, or embryotoxic. Arsenosugars and arsenolipids have recently been identified. Exposure to these compounds and toxicological implications are currently being studied. Arsenosugars are detected mainly in seaweed but are also found to a lesser extent in marine mollusks. Studies addressing arsenosugar toxicity, however, have largely been limited to in vitro studies, which show that arsenosugars are significantly less toxic than both inorganic arsenic and trivalent methylated arsenic metabolites.

It has been found that rice is particularly susceptible to accumulation of arsenic from soil. Rice grown in the United States has an average 260¬†ppb of arsenic, according to a study; but U.S. arsenic intake remains far below World Health Organization-recommended limits. China has set a standard for arsenic limits in food (150¬†ppb), as levels in rice exceed those in water.

The European Commission (2000) reports that levels of arsenic in air range 0‚Äì1¬†ng/m3 in remote areas, 0.2‚Äì1.5¬†ng/m3 in rural areas, 0.5‚Äì3¬†ng/m3 in urban areas, and up to about 50¬†ng/m3 in the vicinity of industrial sites. Based on these data, the European Commission (2000) estimated that in relation to food, cigarette smoking, water, and soil, air contributes less than 1% of total arsenic exposure.

====Pesticides====
The use of lead arsenate pesticides has been effectively eliminated for over 50 years. However, because of the pesticide&#x27;s environmental persistence, it is estimated that millions of acres of land are still contaminated with lead arsenate residues. This presents a potentially significant public health concern in some areas of the United States (e.g., New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin), where large areas of land used historically as orchards have been converted into residential developments.

Some modern uses of arsenic-based pesticides still exist. Chromated copper arsenate has been registered for use in the United States since the 1940s as a wood preservative, protecting wood from insects and microbial agents. In 2003, manufacturers of chromated copper arsenate instituted a voluntary recall of residential uses of wood treated with the chemical. The Environmental Protection Agency Act 2008 final report stated that chromated copper arsenate is still approved for use in nonresidential applications, such as in marine facilities (pilings and structures), utility poles, and sand highway structures.

====Copper smelting====
Exposure studies in the copper smelting industry are much more extensive and have established definitive links between arsenic, a by-product of copper smelting, and lung cancer via inhalation. Dermal and neurological effects were also increased in some of these studies. Although as time went on, occupational controls became more stringent and workers were exposed to reduced arsenic concentrations, the arsenic exposures measured from these studies ranged from about 0.05 to 0.3¬†mg/m3 and are significantly higher than airborne environmental exposures to arsenic (which range from 0 to 0.000003¬†mg/m3).

==Pathophysiology==
Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy system of the cell is disrupted resulting in cellular apoptosis. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis. Low potassium levels in the cells increases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.
Arsenic in cells clearly stimulates the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When the H2O2 reacts with certain metals such as iron or manganese it produces a highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Inorganic arsenic trioxide found in ground water particularly affects voltage-gated potassium channels,
disrupting cellular electrolytic function resulting in neurological disturbances, cardiovascular episodes such as prolonged QT interval, neutropenia, high blood pressure,
central nervous system dysfunction, anemia, and death.

Arsenic has also been shown to induce cardiac hypertrophy by activating certain transcription factors involved in pathologically remodeling the heart. Tissue culture studies have shown that arsenic compounds block both IKr and Iks channels and, at the same time, activate IK-ATP channels. Arsenic compounds also disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system organ failure, probably from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis. A post mortem reveals brick red colored mucosa, due to severe hemorrhage. Although arsenic causes toxicity, it can also play a protective role.

===Mechanism===
Arsenite inhibits not only the formation of acetyl-CoA but also the enzyme succinic dehydrogenase. Arsenate can replace phosphate in many reactions. It is able to form Glc-6-arsenate in vitro; therefore it has been argued that hexokinase could be inhibited. (Eventually this may be a mechanism leading to muscle weakness in chronic arsenic poisoning.) In the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction arsenate attacks the enzyme-bound thioester. The formed 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate is unstable and hydrolyzes spontaneously. Thus, ATP formation in glycolysis is inhibited while bypassing the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction. (Moreover, the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes might be affected, followed by a higher oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and subsequently enhanced cyanosis.) As shown by Gresser (1981), submitochondrial particles synthesize adenosine-5&#x27;-diphosphate-arsenate from ADP and arsenate in presence of succinate. Thus, by a variety of mechanisms arsenate leads to an impairment of cell respiration and subsequently diminished ATP formation. This is consistent with observed ATP depletion of exposed cells and histopathological findings of mitochondrial and cell swelling, glycogen depletion in liver cells and fatty change in liver, heart and kidney.

Experiments demonstrated enhanced arterial thrombosis in a rat animal model, elevations of serotonin levels, thromboxane A[2] and adhesion proteins in platelets, while human platelets showed similar responses. The effect on vascular endothelium may eventually be mediated by the arsenic-induced formation of nitric oxide.
It was demonstrated that +3 As concentrations substantially lower than concentrations required for inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin L in B cell line TA3 were sufficient to trigger apoptosis in the same B cell line, while the latter could be a mechanism mediating immunosuppressive effects.

Its comutagenic effects may be explained by interference with base and nucleotide excision repair, eventually through interaction with zinc finger structures. Dimethylarsinic acid, DMA(V), caused DNA single strand breaks resulting from inhibition of repair enzymes at levels of 5 to 100 mM in human epithelial cells.

MMA(III) and DMA(III) were also shown to be directly genotoxic by effectuating scissions in supercoiled Œ¶X174 DNA. Increased arsenic exposure is associated with an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister-chromatid exchanges. An explanation for chromosomal aberrations is the sensitivity of the protein tubulin and the mitotic spindle to arsenic. Histological observations confirm effects on cellular integrity, shape and locomotion.

DMA(III) is able to form reactive oxygen species by reaction with molecular oxygen. Resulting metabolites are the dimethylarsenic radical and the dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical.
Both DMA(III) and DMA(V) were shown to release iron from horse spleen as well as from human liver ferritin if ascorbic acid was administered simultaneously. Thus, formation of reactive oxygen species can be promoted.
Moreover, arsenic could cause oxidative stress by depleting the cell&#x27;s antioxidants, especially the ones containing thiol groups. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species like that cited above and hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides causes aberrant gene expression at low concentrations and lesions of lipids, proteins and DNA in higher concentrations which eventually lead to cellular death.
In a rat animal model, urine levels of 8-hydroxy-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (as a biomarker of DNA damage byreactive oxygen species) were measured after treatment with DMA(V). In comparison to control levels, they turned out to be significantly increased. This theory is further supported by a cross-sectional study which found elevated mean serum lipid peroxides in the As exposed individuals which correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites and inversely correlated with nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in whole blood.

Another study found an association of As levels in whole blood with the level of reactive oxidants in plasma and an inverse relationship with plasma antioxidants. A finding of the latter study indicates that methylation might in fact be a detoxification pathway with regard to oxidative stress: the results showed that the lower the As methylation capacity was, the lower the level of plasma antioxidant capacity. As reviewed by Kitchin (2001), the oxidative stress theory provides an explanation for the preferred tumor sites connected with arsenic exposure. Considering that a high partial pressure of oxygen is present in lungs and DMA(III) is excreted in gaseous state via the lungs, this seems to be a plausible mechanism for special vulnerability. The fact that DMA is produced by methylation in the liver, excreted via the kidneys and later on stored in the bladder accounts for the other tumor localizations.

Regarding DNA methylation, some studies suggest interaction of As with methyltransferases which leads to an inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through hypermethylation; others state that hypomethylation might occur due to a lack of SAM resulting in aberrant gene activation. An experiment by Zhong et al. (2001) with arsenite-exposed human lung A549, kidney UOK123, UOK109 and UOK121 cells isolated eight different DNA fragments by methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions. It turned out that six of the fragments were hyper- and two of them were hypomethylated. Higher levels of DNA methyltransferase mRNA and enzyme activity were found.

Kitchin (2001) proposed a model of altered growth factors which lead to cell proliferation and thus to carcinogenesis. From observations, it is known that chronic low-dose arsenic poisoning can lead to increased tolerance to its acute toxicity. MRP1-overexpressing lung tumor GLC4/Sb30 cells poorly accumulate arsenite and arsenate. This is mediated through MRP-1 dependent efflux. The efflux requires glutathione, but no arsenic-glutathione complex formation.

Although many mechanisms have been proposed, no definite model can be given for the mechanisms of chronic arsenic poisoning. The prevailing events of toxicity and carcinogenicity might be quite tissue-specific. Current consensus on the mode of carcinogenesis is that it acts primarily as a tumor promoter. Its co-carcinogenicity has been demonstrated in several models. However, the finding of several studies that chronically arsenic-exposed Andean populations (as most extremely exposed to UV-light) do not develop skin cancer with chronic arsenic exposure, is puzzling.

===Kinetics===
The two forms of inorganic arsenic, reduced (trivalent As(III)) and oxidized (pentavalent As(V)), can be absorbed, and accumulated in tissues and body fluids. In the liver, the metabolism of arsenic involves enzymatic and non-enzymatic methylation; the most frequently excreted metabolite (‚â• 90%) in the urine of mammals is dimethylarsinic acid or cacodylic acid, DMA(V). Dimethylarsenic acid is also known as Agent Blue and was used as herbicide in the American war in Vietnam.

In humans inorganic arsenic is reduced nonenzymatically from pentoxide to trioxide, using glutathione or it is mediated by enzymes. Reduction of arsenic pentoxide to arsenic trioxide increases its toxicity and bio availability, Methylation occurs through methyltransferase enzymes. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) may serve as methyl donor. Various pathways are used, the principal route being dependent on the current environment of the cell. Resulting metabolites are monomethylarsonous acid, MMA(III), and dimethylarsinous acid, DMA(III).

Methylation had been regarded as a detoxification process, but reduction from +5 As to +3 As may be considered as a bioactivation instead. Another suggestion is that methylation might be a detoxification if &quot;As[III] intermediates are not permitted to accumulate&quot; because the pentavalent organoarsenics have a lower affinity to thiol groups than inorganic pentavalent arsenics. Gebel (2002) stated that methylation is a detoxification through accelerated excretion. With regard to carcinogenicity it has been suggested that methylation should be regarded as a toxification.

Arsenic, especially +3 As, binds to single, but with higher affinity to vicinal sulfhydryl groups, thus reacts with a variety of proteins and inhibits their activity. It was also proposed that binding of arsenite at nonessential sites might contribute to detoxification. Arsenite inhibits members of the disulfide oxidoreductase family like glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.

The remaining unbound arsenic (‚â§ 10%) accumulates in cells, which over time may lead to skin, bladder, kidney, liver, lung, and prostate cancers. Other forms of arsenic toxicity in humans have been observed in blood, bone marrow, cardiac, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, gonadal, kidney, liver, pancreatic, and skin tissues.

The acute minimal lethal dose of arsenic in adults is estimated to be 70 to 200¬†mg or 1¬†mg/kg/day.

===Heat shock response===
Another aspect is the similarity of arsenic effects to the heat shock response. Short-term arsenic exposure has effects on signal transduction inducing heat shock proteins with masses of 27, 60, 70, 72, 90, and 110 kDa as well as metallothionein, ubiquitin, mitogen-activated [MAP] kinases, extracellular regulated kinase [ERK], c-jun terminal kinases [JNK] and p38.
Via JNK and p38 it activates c-fos, c-jun and egr-1 which are usually activated by growth factors and cytokines. The effects are largely dependent on the dosing regime and may be as well inversed.

As shown by some experiments reviewed by Del Razo (2001), reactive oxygen species induced by low levels of inorganic arsenic increase the transcription and the activity of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and the nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) (maybe enhanced by elevated MAPK levels), which results in c-fos/c-jun activation, over-secretion of pro-inflammatory and growth promoting cytokines stimulating cell proliferation. Germolec et al. (1996) found an increased cytokine expression and cell proliferation in skin biopsies from individuals chronically exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water.

Increased AP-1 and NF-Œ∫B obviously also result in an up-regulation of mdm2 protein, which decreases p53 protein levels. Thus, taking into account p53&#x27;s function, a lack of it could cause a faster accumulation of mutations contributing to carcinogenesis. However, high levels of inorganic arsenic inhibit NF-Œ∫B activation and cell proliferation. An experiment of Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated increased binding activity of AP-1 and NF-Œ∫B after acute (24 h) exposure to +3 sodium arsenite, whereas long-term exposure (10‚Äì12 weeks) yielded the opposite result. The authors conclude that the former may be interpreted as a defense response while the latter could lead to carcinogenesis. As the contradicting findings and connected mechanistic hypotheses indicate, there is a difference in acute and chronic effects of arsenic on signal transduction which is not clearly understood yet.

===Oxidative stress===
Studies have demonstrated that the oxidative stress generated by arsenic may disrupt the signal transduction pathways of the nuclear transcriptional factors PPARs, AP-1, and NF-Œ∫B, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-Œ±. The interference of oxidative stress with signal transduction pathways may affect physiological processes associated with cell growth, metabolic syndrome X, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and diabetes-2. Recent scientific evidence has elucidated the physiological roles of the PPARs in the œâ- hydroxylation of fatty acids and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-Œ∫B and AP-1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, ‚àí6, ‚àí8, ‚àí12, and TNF-Œ±), cell4 adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflammatory nitric oxide (NO), and anti-apoptotic factors.

Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The human liver after exposure to therapeutic drugs may exhibit hepatic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. However, the literature provides insufficient scientific evidence to show cause and effect between arsenic and the onset of diabetes mellitus Type 2.

==Diagnosis==
Arsenic may be measured in blood or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal over dosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Organic arsenic compounds tend to be eliminated in the urine in unchanged form, while inorganic forms are largely converted to organic arsenic compounds in the body prior to urinary excretion. The current biological exposure index for U.S. workers of 35¬†Œºg/L total urinary arsenic may easily be exceeded by a healthy person eating a seafood meal.

Tests are available to diagnose poisoning by measuring arsenic in blood, urine, hair, and fingernails. The urine test is the most reliable test for arsenic exposure within the last few days. Urine testing needs to be done within 24‚Äì48¬†hours for an accurate analysis of an acute exposure. Tests on hair and fingernails can measure exposure to high levels of arsenic over the past 6‚Äì12 months. These tests can determine if one has been exposed to above-average levels of arsenic. They cannot predict, however, whether the arsenic levels in the body will affect health. Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shorter term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic, important in trying to determine the source of the exposure.

Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure, an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and microparticle induced X-ray emission. The highly focused and intense beams study small spots on biological samples allowing analysis to micro level along with the chemical speciation. In a study, this method has been used to follow arsenic level before, during and after treatment with arsenious oxide in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

==Treatment==

===Chelation===
Dimercaprol and dimercaptosuccinic acid are chelating agents that sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most important side effect is hypertension. Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer. Dimercaptosuccinic acid monoesters, e.g. MiADMSA, are promising antidotes for arsenic poisoning.

===Nutrition===
Supplemental potassium decreases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide.

==History==

Beginning in about 3000 BC arsenic was mined and added to copper in the alloying of bronze, but the adverse health effects of working with arsenic led to it being abandoned when a viable alternative, tin, was discovered.

In addition to its presence as a poison, for centuries arsenic was used medicinally. It has been used for over 2,400 years as a part of traditional Chinese medicine. In the western world, arsenic compounds, such as salvarsan, were used extensively to treat syphilis before penicillin was introduced. It was eventually replaced as a therapeutic agent by sulfa drugs and then by other antibiotics. Arsenic was also an ingredient in many tonics (or &quot;patent medicines&quot;).

In addition, during the Elizabethan era, some women used a mixture of vinegar, chalk, and arsenic applied topically to whiten their skin. This use of arsenic was intended to prevent aging and creasing of the skin, but some arsenic was inevitably absorbed into the blood stream.

During the Victorian era (late 19th century) in the United States, U.S. newspapers advertised &quot;arsenic complexion wafers&quot; that promised to remove facial blemishes such as moles and pimples.

Some pigments, most notably the popular Emerald Green (known also under several other names), were based on arsenic compounds. Overexposure to these pigments was a frequent cause of accidental poisoning of artists and craftsmen.

Arsenic became a favored method for murder of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, particularly among ruling classes in Italy allegedly. Because the symptoms are similar to those of cholera, which was common at the time, arsenic poisoning often went undetected. By the 19th century, it had acquired the nickname &quot;inheritance powder&quot;, perhaps because impatient heirs were known or suspected to use it to ensure or accelerate their inheritances. It was also a common murder technique in the 19th century in domestic violence situations, such as the case of Rebecca Copin, who attempted to poison her husband by &quot;putting arsenic in his coffee&quot;.

In post-WW1 Hungary, arsenic extracted by boiling fly paper was used in an estimated 300 murders by the Angel Makers of Nagyr√©v.

In imperial China, arsenic trioxide and sulfides were used in murder, as well as for capital punishment for members of the royal family or aristocracy. Forensic studies have determined that the Guangxu Emperor (d. 1908) was murdered by arsenic, most likely ordered by the Empress Dowager Cixi or Generalissimo Yuan Shikai. Likewise, in ancient Korea, and particularly in the Joseon Dynasty, arsenic-sulfur compounds had been used as a major ingredient of &quot;sayak&quot; (ÏÇ¨ÏïΩ; Ë≥úËó•), which was a poison cocktail used in capital punishment of high-profile political figures and members of the royal family. Due to social and political prominence of the condemned, many of these events were well-documented, often in the Annals of Joseon Dynasty; they are sometimes portrayed in historical television miniseries because of their dramatic nature.

One of the worst incidents of arsenic poisoning via well water occurred in Bangladesh, which the World Health Organization called the &quot;largest mass poisoning of a population in history&quot; and was recognized as a major public health concern. The contamination in the Ganga-Brahmaputra fluvial plains in India and Padma-Meghna fluvial plains in Bangladesh demonstrated adverse impacts on human health.

Arsenic poisoning from exposure to groundwater is believed to be responsible for the illness experienced by those that witnessed the 2007 Carancas impact event in Peru, as local residents inhaled steam which was contaminated with arsenic, produced from groundwater which boiled from the intense heat and pressure produced by a chondrite meteorite impacting the ground.

== Legislation ==
In the U.S. in 1975, under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determined the National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulation levels of arsenic (inorganic contaminant ‚Äì IOCs) to be 0.05¬†mg/L (50 parts per billion ‚Äì ppb).

Throughout the years, many studies reported dose-dependent effects of arsenic in drinking water and skin cancer. In order to prevent new cases and death from cancerous and non-cancerous diseases, the Safe Drinking Water Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to revise arsenic&#x27;s levels and specified the maximum contaminant level (MCL). MCLs are set as close to the health goals as possible, considering cost, benefits and the ability of public water systems to detect and remove contaminants using suitable treatment technologies.

In 2001, Environmental Protection Agency adopted a lower standard of MCL 0.01¬†mg/L (10 ppb) for arsenic in drinking water that applies to both community water systems and non-transient non-community water systems.

In some other countries, when developing national drinking water standards based on the guideline values, it is necessary to take account of a variety of geographical, socio-economic, dietary and other conditions affecting potential exposure. These factors lead to national standards that differ appreciably from the guideline values. That is the case in countries such as India and Bangladesh, where the permissible limit of arsenic in absence of an alternative source of water is 0.05¬†mg/L.

=== Challenges to implementation ===

Arsenic removal technologies are traditional treatment processes which have been tailored to improve removal of arsenic from drinking water. Although some of the removal processes, such as precipitative processes, adsorption processes, ion exchange processes, and separation (membrane) processes, may be technically feasible, their cost may be prohibitive.

For underdeveloped countries, the challenge is finding the means to fund such technologies. The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has estimated the total national annualized cost of treatment, monitoring, reporting, record keeping, and administration to enforce the MCL rule to be approximately $181 million. Most of the cost is due to the installation and operation of the treatment technologies needed to reduce arsenic in public water systems.

== Pregnancy==
Arsenic exposure through groundwater is highly concerning throughout the perinatal period. Pregnant women are a high-risk population because not only are they at risk for adverse outcomes, but in-utero exposure also poses health risks to the foetus.

There is a dose-dependent relationship between perinatal exposure to arsenic and infant mortality, meaning that infants born to people exposed to higher concentrations, or exposed for longer periods of time, have a higher mortality rate.

Studies have shown that ingesting arsenic through groundwater during pregnancy poses dangers to the pregnant woman including, but not limited to abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pigmentation changes, and cancer. Research has also demonstrated that arsenic exposure also causes low birth weight, low birth size, infant mortality, and a variety of other outcomes in infants. Some of these effects, like lower birth-rate and size may be due to the effects of arsenic on weight gain during pregnancy.

<text>In Roman mythology, Mefitis (or Mephitis; Mefite in Italian) was a minor goddess of the poisonous gases emitted from the ground in swamps and volcanic vapors.

==Overview==
Mefitis was the Samnite and Oscian goddess of the foul-smelling gases of the earth, worshipped in central and southern Italy since before Roman times, with her main shrine at the volcano Ampsanctus in Samnium. 

There were temples dedicated to her in Cremona and on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. It is theorized that Mefitis was originally a goddess of underground sources, such as natural springs‚Äî the fact that many of these springs were sulfurous led to her association with noxious gases. She is almost always identified with volcanoes, having been worshipped at Pompeii. Her name, which likely means &quot;one who smokes in the middle&quot;, is sometimes spelled Mephitis. The connection with subterranean spaces also links her with Chthonic deities.

Foul-smelling geological fissures connected to the divinity (see below) are located in Italy along the Via Appia between Rome and Brindisi. There, the ancient Romans would rest on their travels and pay homage to the goddess by performing animal sacrifices using the fissure&#x27;s deadly gases. Many clay votive statuettes and other objects found in the Ansanto valley depict wild boars, perhaps indicating that these animals were particularly sacred to the goddess. It has been proposed that Mefitis&#x27; shrines were associated with healing through adjacent sulphuric springs.

Today, it lies near the village of Rocca San Felice in the province of Avellino (Campania region).

Virgil describes this sanctuary in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;:
Varro mentions a Grove of Mefitis on the Esquiline, where the women-only festival of Matralia was celebrated on 1 March. Nearby altars to Mala Fortuna, the aspect of the goddess Fortuna associated with misfortune, and Febris, the goddess of fevers, seem to indicate that the air in this part of Rome was considered unwholesome.

At Rossano di Vaglio there was a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess. Reconstructions of the settlement and the sanctuary are in the Museo delle Antiche Genti. Finds from this site link Mefitis with Mamers, a fertility god worshipped by the Osci since pre-Roman times and thought to be a variant of Mars. Mirabella Eclano (Irpinia) was the site of another sanctuary. An inscription on the wall of the House of the Great Fountain in Pompeii mentions a festival celebrating Mefitis, organized by the &quot;gens Mamia&quot;.

Mefitis was, like Cloacina, sometimes seen as an aspect of Venus. Other deities associated with sulfur springs, and hence with Mefitis, were Albunea and the Greek goddess Leucothea.

==Etymology and derivatives==
The etymology of the name &quot;Mefitis&quot; is controversial, but according to the Italian linguist Alberto Manco, the system of the epithets that identified the goddess from place to place would prove her relationship with a water-based dimension. Many hypotheses have been put forward concerning the etymology of the name of the goddess. Poccetti suggested the derivation from the words &quot;medhio-dhuƒ´htis&quot; means ‚Äúthat which burns within‚Äù

&quot;Mephitic&quot;, derived from &quot;Mefitis&quot;, is now an adjective in the English language meaning &quot;offensive in odour&quot;; &quot;noxious&quot;; and &quot;poisonous&quot;. In Italian, a mefite is also a &quot;solfatara&quot; or fumarole (i.e., a gaseous fissure).

The name of the family of animals Mephitidae (mephitids, or skunks and their kin) and of the genus &quot;Mephitis&quot; (skunks of North and Central America) are both related to &quot;mephitic&quot;, so named for the noxious secretions of their scent glands.

<text>Mellona or Mellonia was an ancient Roman goddess said by St. Augustine to promote the supply of honey (Latin &quot;mel, mellis&quot;) as Pomona did for apples and Bubona for cattle. Arnobius describes her as &quot;a goddess important and powerful regarding bees, taking care of and protecting the sweetness of honey.&quot;

W.H. Roscher includes Mellona among the &quot;indigitamenta&quot;, the list of deities maintained by Roman priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked for rituals.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Mens, also known as Mens Bona (Latin for &quot;Good Mind&quot;), was the personification of thought, consciousness and the mind, and also of &quot;right-thinking&quot;. The founding &quot;(dies natalis)&quot; of her temple in Rome was celebrated on June 8. A temple on the Capitoline Hill in Rome was vowed to Mens in 217 BC on advice from the Sibylline Books, after the defeat of Lake Trasimene, and was dedicated in 215 BC.

==In Latin poetry==
In Latin love elegy, Mens Bona is represented as a guardian against Desire (&quot;Cupido&quot;) and amorous pursuits. Propertius celebrated his escape from erotic bondage to his Cynthia by dedicating himself to the shrine of Mens Bona. Ovid depicted Cupid as leading Mens Bona as a captive in his triumphal parade.

==Legacy==

The Latin word &quot;mens&quot; expresses the idea of &quot;mind&quot; and is the origin of English words like &quot;mental&quot; and &quot;dementia&quot;. The gifted-only organization Mensa International was originally to be named &quot;mens&quot; in the sense of &quot;mind&quot;, but took instead the name &quot;Mensa&quot; (Latin: &quot;table&quot;) to avoid ambiguity with &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; in English and &quot;mens&quot; in other languages such as the Dutch language. In the Dutch vocabulary, &quot;mens&quot; is the word for &quot;man&quot; as in &quot;mankind&quot;.

<doc id="85502" wikidata="Q717546" url="?curid=85502" title="Mezentius">
<text>In Roman mythology, Mezentius was an Etruscan king, and father of Lausus. Sent into exile because of his cruelty, he moved to Latium. He reveled in bloodshed and was overwhelmingly savage on the battlefield, but more significantly to a Roman audience he was a &quot;contemptor divum&quot;, a &quot;despiser of the gods.&quot;

He appears in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, primarily book ten, where he aids Turnus in a war against Aeneas and the Trojans. While in battle with Aeneas, he is critically injured by a spear blow, but his son Lausus bravely blocks Aeneas&#x27;s final blow. Lausus is then killed by Aeneas, and Mezentius is able to escape death for a short while. Once he hears of Lausus&#x27; death, he feels ashamed that his son died in his place and returns to battle on his horse Rhaebus in order to avenge him. He is able to keep Aeneas on the defensive for some time by riding around Aeneas and throwing javelins. Eventually, Aeneas kills the horse with a spear and pins Mezentius underneath. He is overcome by Aeneas, but remains defiant and refuses to ask for mercy, as Turnus later does; he only asks that he be buried with his son.

In the traditional myth that predates the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Mezentius actually outlived Aeneas, who &#x27;disappeared&#x27; into the river which Aeneas became associated with in a hero cult. However, since his benefactor Maecenas was a native Etruscan, Virgil portrayed Mezentius as a tyrant, attributing to him personally the evils of which the Greek authors had previously accused the Etruscans, such as torture and savagery, an ethnic prejudice already present in the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;. Thus he created something of a scapegoat of Mezentius and portrayed the Etruscan people as a good race who fight alongside Aeneas.

<text>Gaius Mucius Cordus, better known with his later cognomen Scaevola ( , ), was an ancient Roman youth, possibly mythical, famous for his bravery.

In 508 BC, during the war between Rome and Clusium, the Clusian king Lars Porsena laid siege to Rome. Gaius Mucius Cordus, with the approval of the Roman Senate, sneaked into the Etruscan camp with the intent of assassinating Porsena. Since it was the soldiers&#x27; pay day, there were two similarly dressed people, one of whom was the king, on a raised platform speaking to the troops. This caused Mucius to misidentify his target, and he killed Porsena&#x27;s scribe by mistake. After being captured, he famously declared to Porsena: &quot;I am a Roman citizen, men call me Gaius Mucius. I came here as an enemy to kill my enemy, and I am as ready to die as I am to kill. We Romans act bravely and, when adversity strikes, we suffer bravely.&quot; He also declared that he was the first of three hundred Roman youths to volunteer for the task of assassinating Porsena at the risk of losing their own lives.

&quot;Watch&quot;, he is said to have declared, &quot;so that you know how cheap the body is to men who have their eye on great glory&quot;. Mucius thrust his right hand into a fire which was lit for sacrifice and held it there without giving any indication of pain, thereby earning for himself and his descendants the cognomen &quot;Scaevola&quot;, meaning &quot;left-handed&quot;. Porsena was shocked at the youth&#x27;s bravery, and dismissed him from the Etruscan camp, free to return to Rome, saying &quot;Go back, since you do more harm to yourself than me&quot;. At the same time, the king also sent ambassadors to Rome to offer peace.

Mucius was granted farming land on the right-hand bank of the Tiber, which later became known as the &quot;Mucia Prata&quot; (Mucian Meadows).
==In popular culture==
*Dante Alighieri refers to Mucius and the sacrifice of his hand within the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. In &quot;Paradiso&quot; Canto 4: 82‚Äì87, along with St. Lawrence, Mucius is depicted as a person possessing the rarest and firmest of wills. 
*In a poem in &quot;Musa Posthuma&quot;, Martha Marchina compared Mucius unfavorably to the martyr Martha and suggests that Martha was the stronger hero because she suffered worse on behalf of God. 
*Jean-Jacques Rousseau mentions in Book One of his &quot;Confessions&quot; that as a child, he attempted to replicate Mucius&#x27; action by placing his hand over a chafing dish.
* At the age of twelve, Friedrich Nietzsche, attempting to prove to his classmates at Schulpforta that the story could be true, burnt his outstretched palm over a book of burning matches without expression of pain and was only saved from serious harm by the school&#x27;s prefect.
*Gordon Scott portrayed Mucius in the sword-and-sandal film &quot;Hero of Rome&quot; (1964), which was loosely based on this story.
*Since 1991 Spanish cultural association Fuerzas de Choque Extraordinarii from the festivities of Cartagena has Gaius Mucius Scaevola as their commander.

* In the 2022 television series &quot;Gaslit&quot;, James McCord says to G. Gordon Liddy &quot;Gaius Scaevola would be proud&quot;. McCord is referring to an earlier conversation where Liddy describes holding his hand over a candle in order to prove to several Cubans that he was &quot;macho&quot;. This was part of a program Liddy followed to develop his willpower.

Common names for &quot;Scaevola&quot; species include scaevolas, fan-flowers, half-flowers, and naupaka, the plants&#x27; Hawaiian name. The flowers are shaped as if they have been cut in half. Consequently, the generic name means &quot;left-handed&quot; in Latin. Many Hawaiian legends have been told to explain the formation of the shape of the flowers. In one version a woman tears the flower in half after a quarrel with her lover. The gods, angered, turn all naupaka flowers into half flowers and the two lovers remained separated while the man is destined to search in vain for another whole flower.

&quot;Scaevola&quot; is the only Goodeniaceae genus that is widespread outside of Australia. In at least six separate dispersals, about 40 species have spread throughout the Pacific Basin, with a few reaching the tropical coasts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

The Hawaiian Islands are home to ten &quot;Scaevola&quot; species, nine of which are endemic. Eight of the indigenous species are the result of a single colonization event. &quot;Scaevola glabra&quot; and &quot;Scaevola taccada&quot; arrived separately to produce a total of three colonizations of Hawaii by &quot;Scaevola&quot;. Some of the endemic species are of hybrid origin.

Beach naupaka (&quot;Scaevola taccada&quot; synonym &quot;S. sericea&quot;) occurs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans and is considered an invasive species in Florida, USA, and in some islands of the Caribbean including the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. Beachberry or Inkberry (&quot;Scaevola plumieri&quot;) is widespread along the Atlantic coast of the tropical Americas and Africa; however, it is becoming rarer in areas where &quot;S. taccada&quot; is displacing native coastal plants. 

Most Australian &quot;Scaevola&quot; have dry fruits and sprawling, herbaceous to shrubby habits. By contrast, nearly all species outside Australia have shrub habits with fleshy fruit making dispersal by frugivores easy.{ 

The plant pathogenic sac fungus &quot;Mycosphaerella scaevolae&quot; was discovered on a &quot;Scaevola&quot; fan-flower.

In Europe, &quot;Scaevola aemula&quot; is a fairly common container- and bedding plant, usually grown as an annual.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Scaevola&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1771. He did not explain the origin of the genus name. It is considered to allude to the one-sided shape of the flower, which has a five-lobed tubular corolla; in Latin means &#x27;left-handed&#x27;. Linnaeus created the genus for a species he had previously described as &quot;Lobelia plumieri&quot;, which is thus the type species. Linnaeus did not explicitly use the specific epithet &quot;plumieri&quot; in combination with the genus &quot;Scaevola&quot;; the combination &quot;Scaevola plumieri&quot; was first published by Martin Vahl in 1791.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and myth, Nerio (or Neriene) was an ancient war goddess and the personification of valor. She was the partner of Mars in ancient cult practices, and was sometimes identified with the goddess Bellona, and occasionally with the goddess Minerva. Spoils taken from enemies were sometimes dedicated to Nerio by the Romans. Nerio was later supplanted by mythologized deities appropriated and adapted from other religions.

==Cult role==
Ancient Roman literature seems to have pointed Nerio as one of two wives of war god Mars, the other being &quot;Moles&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name of the goddess is thought to derive from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*h‚ÇÇn·∏ór-&quot;, related to Ancient Greek &quot;·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ&quot;, and both pertaining to the semantic field of masculine attributes, such as strength, vigour, valor.

Aulus Gellius, in his book &quot;Attic Nights&quot;, remarked that her name was a Sabine word meaning &#x27;strength and fortitude&#x27;.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, the di nixi (or dii nixi), also Nixae, were birth deities. They were depicted kneeling or squatting, a more common birthing position in antiquity than in the modern era. The 2nd-century grammarian Festus explains their name as the participle of the Latin verb &quot;nitor, niti, nixus&quot;, &quot;to support oneself,&quot; also &quot;strive, labor,&quot; in this sense &quot;be in labor, give birth.&quot; Varro (1st century BC) said that &quot;enixae&quot; was the term for women in labor brought about by the &quot;Nixae&quot;, who oversee the types of religious practices that pertain to those giving birth. In some editions of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a phrase is taken as referring to the birth goddess Lucina and her counterpart collective, the Nixi.

A statuary group of three kneeling &quot;nixi&quot; or &quot;nixae&quot; stood in front of the Temple of Minerva on the Capitoline Hill. These had been brought to Rome by Manius Acilius Glabrio among the spoils seized from Antiochus the Great after his defeat at Thermopylae in 191 BC, or perhaps from the sack of Corinth in 146.

In the iconography of Greek myth, the kneeling pose is also found in representations of Leto (Roman Latona) giving birth to Apollo and Artemis (Diana), and of Auge giving birth to Telephus, son of Herakles (Hercules). While the ancient Greek gynecologist Soranos had disapproved of giving birth on one&#x27;s knees as &quot;painful and embarrassing,&quot; he recommends it for the obese and for lordotic women, that is, those with a concave curvature of the lower back that would tilt the uterus out of alignment with the birth canal.

==Topography and ritual==
As guardians of the threshold of life, the &quot;Nixi&quot; or &quot;Nixae&quot; may also have been associated with new life in the sense of theological rebirth or salvation. An altar of the Nixae, within the Tarentum in the general area of the Campus Martius, was the site of the annual sacrifice of the October Horse. The altar was possibly underground, as was the nearby altar of Dis Pater and Proserpina. The Tarentum gave its name to the ritual games held there (&quot;ludi tarentini&quot;) that became the Saecular Games. A lengthy inscription marks the occasion of these games under Augustus in 17 BC and notes a nocturnal sacrifice carried out for the &quot;Ilithyis&quot;, Eileithyiai, the Greek counterparts of the &quot;Nixae&quot; as birth goddesses. The phrase &quot;nuptae genibus nixae&quot; (&quot;brides laboring on their knees&quot;) appears twice in this invocation. The attitude of devotion or reverence expressed by &quot;genibus nixae&quot; or &quot;genu nixa&quot;, which might also be translated as &quot;on bended knee,&quot; is formulaic in Latin texts and inscriptions.

It has been suggested that the iconography of kneeling became associated with birth because women sought divine aid for what was often a life-threatening experience in the ancient world. Kneeling also played a role in initiation ritual for mystery religion, which offered the promise of rebirth.

Women prayed and held sacred banquets at the Saecular Games, which were characterized by an &quot;overt and unusual celebration of women, children, and families in a civic festival.&quot; The role of women on this occasion was consonant with the Augustan emphasis on families as necessary to the vitality of the Roman state.
Robert E.A. Palmer has speculated that the area where the altar of the Nixae was located (Piazza Navona) continued to have significance into the modern Christian era:

<doc id="85533" wikidata="Q47586" url="?curid=85533" title="United States Electoral College">
<text>In the United States, the Electoral College is the group of presidential electors that is formed every four years during the presidential election for the sole purpose of voting for the president and vice president. This process is described in Article Two of the Constitution. The number of electoral votes exercised by each state is equal to that state&#x27;s congressional delegation which is the number of Senators (two) plus the number of Representatives for that state. Each state appoints electors using legal procedures determined by its legislature. Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the federal District of Columbia three electors (bringing the total number from 535 to 538). A simple majority of electoral votes (270 or more) is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves a majority, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives, to elect the president, and by the Senate, to elect the vice president.

The states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or district-wide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws prohibiting faithless electors. All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket. Maine and Nebraska choose one elector per congressional district and two electors for the ticket with the highest statewide vote. The electors meet and vote in December, and the inaugurations of the president and vice president take place in January.

The merit of the electoral college system has been a matter of ongoing debate in the United States since its inception at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, becoming more controversial by the latter years of the 19th century, up to the present day. More resolutions have been submitted to amend the Electoral College mechanism than any other part of the constitution. An amendment that would have abolished the system was approved by the House in 1969, but failed to move past the Senate.

Supporters argue that it requires presidential candidates to have broad appeal across the country to win, while critics argue that it is not representative of the popular will of the nation. Winner-take-all systems, especially with representation not proportional to population, do not align with the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;. Critics object to the inequity that, due to the distribution of electors, individual citizens in states with smaller populations have more voting power than those in larger states. Because the number of electors each state appoints is equal to the size of its congressional delegation, each state is entitled to at least three electors regardless of its population, and the apportionment of the statutorily fixed number of the rest is only roughly proportional. This allocation has contributed to runners-up of the nationwide popular vote being elected president in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. In addition, faithless electors may not vote in accord with their pledge. A further objection is that swing states receive the most attention from candidates. By the end of the 20th century, electoral colleges had been abandoned by all other democracies around the world in favor of direct elections for an executive president.:215

==Procedure==

Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution directs each state to appoint a number of electors equal to that state&#x27;s congressional delegation (the number of members of the House of Representatives plus two senators). The same clause empowers each state legislature to determine the manner by which that state&#x27;s electors are chosen but prohibits federal office holders from being named electors. Following the national presidential election day on Tuesday after the first Monday in November, each state, and the federal district, selects its electors according to its laws. After a popular election, the states identify and record their appointed electors in a &quot;Certificate of Ascertainment&quot;, and those appointed electors then meet in their respective jurisdictions and produce a &quot;Certificate of Vote&quot; for their candidate; both certificates are then sent to Congress to be opened and counted.

In 48 of the 50 states, state laws mandate that the winner of the plurality of the statewide popular vote receives all of that state&#x27;s electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, two electoral votes are assigned in this manner, while the remaining electoral votes are allocated based on the plurality of votes in each of their congressional districts. The federal district, Washington, D.C., allocates its 3 electoral votes to the winner of its single district election. States generally require electors to pledge to vote for that state&#x27;s winning ticket; to prevent electors from being faithless electors, most states have adopted various laws to enforce the electors&#x27; pledge.

The electors of each state meet in their respective state capital on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday of December, between December 14 and 20, to cast their votes. The results are sent to and counted by the Congress, where they are tabulated in the first week of January before a joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, presided over by the current vice president, as president of the Senate.

Should a majority of votes not be cast for a candidate, a contingent election takes place: the House holds a presidential election session, where one vote is cast by each of the fifty states. The Senate is responsible for electing the vice president, with each senator having one vote. The elected president and vice president are inaugurated on January 20.

Since 1964, there have been 538 electors. States select 535 of the electors, this number matches the aggregate total of their congressional delegations. The additional three electors come from the Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961, providing that the district established pursuant to Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 as the seat of the federal government (namely, Washington, D.C.) is entitled to the same number of electors as the least populous state. In practice, that results in Washington D.C. being entitled to three electors.

== Background ==

The Electoral College was officially selected as the means of electing president towards the end of the Constitutional Convention, due to pressure from slave states wanting to increase their voting power, since they could count slaves as 3/5 of a person when allocating electors, and by small states who increased their power given the minimum of three electors per state. The compromise was reached after other proposals, including a direct election for president (as proposed by Hamilton among others), failed to get traction among slave states. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt describe it as &quot;not a product of constitutional theory or farsighted design. Rather, it was adopted by default, after all other alternatives had been rejected.&quot;

In 1787, the Constitutional Convention used the Virginia Plan as the basis for discussions, as the Virginia proposal was the first. The Virginia Plan called for Congress to elect the president. Delegates from a majority of states agreed to this mode of election. After being debated, delegates came to oppose nomination by Congress for the reason that it could violate the separation of powers. James Wilson then made a motion for electors for the purpose of choosing the president.

Later in the convention, a committee formed to work out various details. They included the mode of election of the president, including final recommendations for the electors, a group of people apportioned among the states in the same numbers as their representatives in Congress (the formula for which had been resolved in lengthy debates resulting in the Connecticut Compromise and Three-Fifths Compromise), but chosen by each state &quot;in such manner as its Legislature may direct&quot;. Committee member Gouverneur Morris explained the reasons for the change. Among others, there were fears of &quot;intrigue&quot; if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met together regularly, as well as concerns for the independence of the president if he were elected by Congress.

Once the Electoral College had been decided on, several delegates (Mason, Butler, Morris, Wilson, and Madison) openly recognized its ability to protect the election process from cabal, corruption, intrigue, and faction. Some delegates, including James Wilson and James Madison, preferred popular election of the executive. Madison acknowledged that while a popular vote would be ideal, it would be difficult to get consensus on the proposal given the prevalence of slavery in the South:
The convention approved the committee&#x27;s Electoral College proposal, with minor modifications, on September 4, 1787. Delegates from states with smaller populations or limited land area, such as Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland, generally favored the Electoral College with some consideration for states. At the compromise providing for a runoff among the top five candidates, the small states supposed that the House of Representatives, with each state delegation casting one vote, would decide most elections.

In &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, James Madison explained his views on the selection of the president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued that the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the president would be elected by a mixture of the two modes.

Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 68, published on March 12, 1788, laid out what he believed were the key advantages to the Electoral College. The electors come directly from the people and them alone, for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election. Hamilton explained that the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint &quot;the great body of the people&quot; in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public, in a time before telecommunications. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.

Another consideration was that the decision would be made without &quot;tumult and disorder&quot;, as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates, ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified but with a talent for &quot;low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity&quot; attaining high office.

In the Federalist No. 10, James Madison argued against &quot;an interested and overbearing majority&quot; and the &quot;mischiefs of faction&quot; in an electoral system. He defined a faction as &quot;a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.&quot; A republican government (i.e., representative democracy, as opposed to direct democracy) combined with the principles of federalism (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers), would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as sectionalism.

Although the United States Constitution refers to &quot;Electors&quot; and &quot;electors&quot;, neither the phrase &quot;Electoral College&quot; nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century that the name &quot;Electoral College&quot; came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845, and today the term appears in , in the section heading and in the text as &quot;college of electors&quot;.

== History ==
=== Original plan ===
Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution provided the original plan by which the electors voted for president. Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.

According to Stanley Chang, the original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:
# Choice of the president should reflect the &quot;sense of the people&quot; at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a &quot;pre-established body&quot; such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of &quot;foreign powers&quot;.
# The choice would be made decisively with a &quot;full and fair expression of the public will&quot; but also maintaining &quot;as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder&quot;.
# Individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis. Voting for president would include the widest electorate allowed in each state.
# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.
# Candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.

Election expert, William C. Kimberling, reflected on the original intent as follows:

&quot;The function of the College of Electors in choosing the president can be likened to that in the Roman Catholic Church of the College of Cardinals selecting the Pope. The original idea was for the most knowledgeable and informed individuals from each State to select the president based solely on merit and without regard to State of origin or political party.&quot;

According to Supreme Court justice Robert H. Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, the original intention of the framers was that the electors would not feel bound to support any particular candidate, but would vote their conscience, free of external pressure.

&quot;No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated, what is implicit in its text, that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation&#x27;s highest offices.&quot;

In support for his view, Justice Jackson cited Federalist No. 68:
&#x27;It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any pre-established body, but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture... It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.&#x27;

Philip J. VanFossen of Purdue University explains that the original purpose of the electors was not to reflect the will of the citizens, but rather to &quot;serve as a check on a public who might be easily misled.&quot;

Randall Calvert, the Eagleton Professor of Public Affairs and Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, stated, &quot;At the framing the more important consideration was that electors, expected to be more knowledgeable and responsible, would actually do the choosing.&quot;

Constitutional expert Michael Signer explained that the electoral college was designed &quot;to provide a mechanism where intelligent, thoughtful and statesmanlike leaders could deliberate on the winner of the popular vote and, if necessary, choose another candidate who would not put Constitutional values and practices at risk.&quot; Robert Schlesinger, writing for U.S. News and World Report, similarly stated, &quot;The original conception of the Electoral College, in other words, was a body of men who could serve as a check on the uninformed mass electorate.&quot;

==== Breakdown and revision ====
In spite of Hamilton&#x27;s assertion that electors were to be chosen by mass election, initially, state legislatures chose the electors in most of the states. States progressively changed to selection by popular election. In 1824, there were six states in which electors were still legislatively appointed. By 1832, only South Carolina had not transitioned. Since 1864 (with the sole exception of newly admitted Colorado in 1876 for logistical reasons), electors in every state have been chosen based on a popular election held on Election Day. The popular election for electors means the president and vice president are in effect chosen through indirect election by the citizens.

====The emergence of parties and campaigns====
The framers of the Constitution did not anticipate political parties. Indeed George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address in 1796 included an urgent appeal to avert such parties. Neither did the framers anticipate candidates &quot;running&quot; for president. Within just a few years of the ratification of the Constitution, however, both phenomena became permanent features of the political landscape of the United States.

The emergence of political parties and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of 1796 and 1800. In 1796, Federalist Party candidate John Adams won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was Democratic-Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists&#x27; opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.

In 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also again nominated Aaron Burr for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr were tied with one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party&#x27;s first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the House of Representatives pursuant to the Constitution&#x27;s contingency election provision.

Having already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the lame duck House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (The votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election.). On the 36th ballot, Delaware&#x27;s lone Representative, James A. Bayard, made it known that he intended to break the impasse for fear that failure to do so could endanger the future of the Union. Bayard and other Federalists from South Carolina, Maryland, and Vermont abstained, breaking the deadlock and giving Jefferson a majority.

Responding to the problems from those elections, Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the Twelfth Amendment. Starting with the 1804 election, the amendment requires electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.

===Evolution from unpledged to pledged electors===
Some Founding Fathers hoped that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to &quot;analyze&quot; and &quot;deliberate&quot; regarding who is best suited to be president.

In Federalist No. 68 Alexander Hamilton described the Founding Fathers&#x27; view of how electors would be chosen: 

However, when electors were pledged to vote for a specific candidate, the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became, as Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, &quot;voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.&quot; According to Hamilton, writing in 1788, the selection of the president should be &quot;made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].&quot;

Hamilton stated that the electors were to &quot;analyze&quot; the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term &quot;deliberate.&quot; In a 2020 opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, the court additionally cited John Jay&#x27;s view that the electors&#x27; choices would reflect &quot;discretion and discernment.&quot;
Reflecting on this original intention, a U.S. Senate report in 1826 critiqued the evolution of the system:

It was the intention of the Constitution that these electors should be an independent body of men, chosen by the people from among themselves, on account of their superior discernment, virtue, and information; and that this select body should be left to make the election &quot;according to their own will&quot;, without the slightest control from the body of the people. That this intention has failed of its object in every election, is a fact of such universal notoriety that no one can dispute it. Electors, therefore, have not answered the design of their institution. They are not the independent body and superior characters which they were intended to be. They are not left to the exercise of their own judgment: on the contrary, they give their vote, or bind themselves to give it, according to the will of their constituents. They have degenerated into mere agents, in a case which requires no agency, and where the agent must be useless...

In 1833, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story detailed how badly from the framers&#x27; intention the Electoral Process had been &quot;subverted&quot;:

In no respect have the views of the framers of the constitution been so completely frustrated as relates to the independence of the electors in the electoral colleges. It is notorious, that the electors are now chosen wholly with reference to particular candidates, and are silently pledged to vote for them. Nay, upon some occasions the electors publicly pledge themselves to vote for a particular person; and thus, in effect, the whole foundation of the system, so elaborately constructed, is subverted.

Story observed that if an elector does what the framers of the Constitution expected him to do, he would be considered immoral:

So, that nothing is left to the electors after their choice, but to register votes, which are already pledged; and an exercise of an independent judgment would be treated, as a political usurpation, dishonorable to the individual, and a fraud upon his constituents.

=== Evolution to the general ticket ===
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution states:
According to Hamilton, Madison and others, the original intent was that this would take place district by district. The district plan was last carried out in Michigan in 1892. For example, in Massachusetts in 1820, the rule stated &quot;the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.&quot; In other words, the name of a candidate for president was &quot;not&quot; on the ballot. Instead, citizens voted for their local elector.

Some state leaders began to adopt the strategy that the favorite partisan presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way‚Äîa &quot;general ticket&quot; of electors pledged to a party candidate. Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.

When James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison said that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts, and it was inconceivable that a &quot;general ticket&quot; of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: 

Each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. However, Federalist No. 68, insofar as it reflects the intent of the founders, states that Electors will be &quot;selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass,&quot; and with regard to choosing Electors, &quot;they [the framers] have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America.&quot; Several methods for selecting electors are described below.

Madison and Hamilton were so upset by the trend to &quot;general tickets&quot; that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan. Hamilton drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors. Hamilton&#x27;s untimely death in a duel with Aaron Burr in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further. &quot;[T]he election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,&quot; Madison told George Hay in 1823.

Madison also drafted a constitutional amendment that would ensure the original &quot;district&quot; plan of the framers. Jefferson agreed with Hamilton and Madison saying, &quot;all agree that an election by districts would be the best.&quot; Jefferson explained to Madison&#x27;s correspondent why he was doubtful of the amendment being ratified: &quot;the states are now so numerous that I despair of ever seeing another amendment of the constitution.&quot;

=== Evolution of selection plans ===
In 1789, the at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland. Massachusetts, Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and state legislatures chose in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina). New York, North Carolina and Rhode Island did not participate in the election. New York&#x27;s legislature deadlocked over the method of choosing electors and abstained; North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the Constitution.

By 1800, Virginia and Rhode Island voted at large; Kentucky, Maryland, and North Carolina voted popularly by district; and eleven states voted by state legislature. Beginning in 1804 there was a definite trend towards the winner-take-all system for statewide popular vote.

By 1832, only South Carolina legislatively chose its electors, and it abandoned the method after 1860. Maryland was the only state using a district plan, and from 1836 district plans fell out of use until the 20th century, though Michigan used a district plan for 1892 only. States using popular vote by district have included ten states from all regions of the country.

Since 1836, statewide winner-take-all popular voting for electors has been the almost universal practice. Currently, Maine (since 1972) and Nebraska (since 1992) use a district plan, with two at-large electors assigned to support the winner of the statewide popular vote.

===Correlation between popular vote and electoral college votes===

Since the mid-19th century, when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most (though not necessarily a majority) popular votes nationwide, except in four elections: 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. A case has also been made that it happened in 1960. In 1824, when there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, the true national popular vote is uncertain. The electors in 1824 failed to select a winning candidate, so the matter was decided by the House of Representatives.

=== Three-fifths clause and the role of slavery ===

After the initial estimates agreed to in the original Constitution, Congressional and Electoral College reapportionment was made according to a decennial census to reflect population changes, modified by counting three-fifths of slaves. On this basis after the first census, the Electoral College still gave the free men of slave-owning states (but never slaves) extra power (Electors) based on a count of these disenfranchised people, in the choice of the U.S. president.

At the Constitutional Convention, the college composition, in theory, amounted to 49 votes for northern states (in the process of abolishing slavery) and 42 for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first (i.e. 1788) presidential election lacked votes and electors for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7) and for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35. For the next two decades, the three-fifths clause led to electors of free-soil Northern states numbering 8% and 11% more than Southern states. The latter had, in the compromise, relinquished counting two-fifths of their slaves and, after 1810, were outnumbered by 15.4% to 23.2%.

While House members for Southern states were boosted by an average of , a free-soil majority in the college maintained over this early republic and Antebellum period. Scholars conclude that the three-fifths clause had low impact on sectional proportions and factional strength, until denying the North a pronounced supermajority, as to the Northern, federal initiative to abolish slavery. The seats that the South gained from such &quot;slave bonus&quot; were quite evenly distributed between the parties. In the First Party System (1795‚Äì1823), the Jefferson Republicans gained 1.1 percent more adherents from the slave bonus, while the Federalists lost the same proportion. At the Second Party System (1823‚Äì1837) the emerging Jacksonians gained just 0.7% more seats, versus the opposition loss of 1.6%.

The three-fifths slave-count rule is associated with three or four outcomes, 1792‚Äì1860:
* The clause, having reduced the South&#x27;s power, led to John Adams&#x27;s win in 1796 over Thomas Jefferson.
* In 1800, historian Garry Wills argues, Jefferson&#x27;s victory over Adams was due to the slave bonus count in the Electoral College as Adams would have won if citizens&#x27; votes were used for each state. However, historian Sean Wilentz points out that Jefferson&#x27;s purported &quot;slave advantage&quot; ignores an offset by electoral manipulation by anti-Jefferson forces in Pennsylvania. Wilentz concludes that it is a myth to say that the Electoral College was a pro-slavery ploy.
* In 1824, the presidential selection was passed to the House of Representatives, and John Quincy Adams was chosen over Andrew Jackson, who won fewer citizens&#x27; votes. Then Jackson won in 1828, but would have lost if the college were citizen-only apportionment. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory.

The first &quot;Jeffersonian&quot; and &quot;Jacksonian&quot; victories were of great importance as they ushered in sustained party majorities of several Congresses and presidential party eras.

Besides the Constitution prohibiting Congress from regulating foreign or domestic slave trade before 1808 and a duty on states to return escaped &quot;persons held to service&quot;, legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar argues that the college was originally advocated by slaveholders as a bulwark to prop up slavery. In the Congressional apportionment provided in the text of the Constitution with its Three-Fifths Compromise estimate, &quot;Virginia emerged as the big winner [with] more than a quarter of the [votes] needed to win an election in the first round [for Washington&#x27;s first presidential election in 1788].&quot; Following the 1790 United States census, the most populous state was Virginia, with 39.1% slaves, or 292,315 counted three-fifths, to yield a calculated number of 175,389 for congressional apportionment.

&quot;The &quot;free&quot; state of Pennsylvania had 10% more free persons than Virginia but got 20% fewer electoral votes.&quot; Pennsylvania split eight to seven for Jefferson, favoring Jefferson with a majority of 53% in a state with 0.1% slave population. Historian Eric Foner agrees the Constitution&#x27;s Three-Fifths Compromise gave protection to slavery.

Supporters of the College have provided many counterarguments to the charges that it defended slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the president who helped abolish slavery, won a College majority in 1860 despite winning 39.8% of citizen&#x27;s votes. This, however, was a clear plurality of a popular vote divided among four main candidates.

Benner notes that Jefferson&#x27;s first margin of victory would have been wider had the entire slave population been counted on a &quot;per capita&quot; basis. He also notes that some of the most vociferous critics of a national popular vote at the constitutional convention were delegates from free states, including Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, who declared that such a system would lead to a &quot;great evil of cabal and corruption,&quot; and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, who called a national popular vote &quot;radically vicious&quot;.

Delegates Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman of Connecticut, a state which had adopted a gradual emancipation law three years earlier, also criticized a national popular vote. Of like view was Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a member of Adams&#x27; Federalist Party, presidential candidate in 1800. He hailed from South Carolina and was a slaveholder. In 1824, Andrew Jackson, a slaveholder from Tennessee, was similarly defeated by John Quincy Adams, a strong critic of slavery.

=== Fourteenth Amendment ===
Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state&#x27;s representation in the House of Representatives to be reduced if the state denies the right to vote to any male citizen aged 21 or older, unless on the basis of &quot;participation in rebellion, or other crime&quot;. The reduction is to be proportionate to such people denied a vote. This amendment refers to &quot;the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States&quot; (among other elections). It is the only part of the Constitution currently alluding to electors being selected by popular vote.

On May 8, 1866, during a debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, delivered a speech on the amendment&#x27;s intent. Regarding Section 2, he said:
Federal law () implements Section 2&#x27;s mandate.

=== Meeting of electors ===
Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to fix the day on which the electors shall vote, which must be the same day throughout the United States. And both Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 and the Twelfth Amendment that replaced it specifies that &quot;the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.&quot;

In 1887, Congress passed the Electoral Count Act, now codified in Title 3, Chapter 1 of the United States Code, establishing specific procedures for the counting of the electoral votes. The law was passed in response to the disputed 1876 presidential election, in which several states submitted competing slates of electors. Among its provisions, the law established deadlines that the states must meet when selecting their electors, resolving disputes, and when they must cast their electoral votes.

From 1948 to 2022, the date fixed by Congress for the meeting of the Electoral College was &quot;on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December next following their appointment&quot;. As of 2022, with the passing of &quot;S.4573 - Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022&quot;, this was changed to be &quot;on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December next following their appointment&quot;.

Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, disqualifies all elected and appointed federal officials from being electors. The Office of the Federal Register is charged with administering the Electoral College.

After the vote, each state sends to Congress a certified record of their electoral votes, called the Certificate of Vote. These certificates are opened during a joint session of Congress, held on January 6 unless another date is specified by law, and read aloud by the incumbent vice president, acting in his capacity as &quot;president of the Senate&quot;. If any person receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, that person is declared the winner. If there is a tie, or if no candidate for either or both offices receives an absolute majority, then choice falls to Congress in a procedure known as a contingent election.

== Modern mechanics ==
=== Summary ===
Even though the aggregate national popular vote is calculated by state officials, media organizations, and the Federal Election Commission, the people only indirectly elect the president and vice president. The president and vice president of the United States are elected by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors from the fifty states and Washington, D.C. Electors are selected state-by-state, as determined by the laws of each state. Since the 1824 election, the majority of states have chosen their presidential electors based on winner-take-all results in the statewide popular vote on Election Day.

, Maine and Nebraska are exceptions as both use the congressional district method, Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1992. In most states, the popular vote ballots list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a ticket). The slate of electors that represent the winning ticket will vote for those two offices. Electors are nominated by the party and, usually, they vote for the ticket to which are promised.

Many states require an elector to vote for the candidate to which the elector is pledged, but some &quot;faithless electors&quot; have voted for other candidates or refrained from voting. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the Twelfth Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote winners as vice president.
=== Electors ===
==== Apportionment ====

A state&#x27;s number of electors equals the number of representatives plus two electors for the senators the state has in the United States Congress. Each state is entitled to at least one representative, the remaining number of representatives per state is apportioned based on their respective populations, determined every ten years by the United States census. In summary, 153 electors are divided equally among the states and the District of Columbia (3 each), and the remaining 385 are assigned by an apportionment among states.

Under the Twenty-third Amendment, Washington, D.C., is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state but no more electors than the least populous state. Because the least populous state (Wyoming, in the 2020 census) has three electors, D.C. cannot have more than three electors. Even if D.C. were a state, its population would entitle it to only three electors. Based on its population per electoral vote, D.C. has the third highest per capita Electoral College representation, after Wyoming and Vermont.

Currently, there are 538 electors, based on 435 representatives, 100 senators from the fifty states and three electors from Washington, D.C. The six states with the most electors are California (54), Texas (40), Florida (30), New York (28), Illinois (19), and Pennsylvania (19). The District of Columbia and the six least populous states‚ÄîAlaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming‚Äîhave three electors each.

==== Nominations ====
The custom of allowing recognized political parties to select a slate of prospective electors developed early. In contemporary practice, each presidential-vice presidential ticket has an associated slate of potential electors. Then on Election Day, the voters select a ticket and thereby select the associated electors.

Candidates for elector are nominated by state chapters of nationally oriented political parties in the months prior to Election Day. In some states, the electors are nominated by voters in primaries the same way other presidential candidates are nominated. In some states, such as Oklahoma, Virginia, and North Carolina, electors are nominated in party conventions. In Pennsylvania, the campaign committee of each candidate names their respective electoral college candidates, an attempt to discourage faithless electors. Varying by state, electors may also be elected by state legislatures or appointed by the parties themselves.

==== Selection process ====
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution requires each state legislature to determine how electors for the state are to be chosen, but it disqualifies any person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, from being an elector. Under Section3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, any person who has sworn an oath to support the United States Constitution in order to hold either a state or federal office, and later rebelled against the United States directly or by giving assistance to those doing so, is disqualified from being an elector. Congress may remove this disqualification by a two-thirds vote in each house.

All states currently choose presidential electors by popular vote. As of 2020, eight states name the electors on the ballot. Mostly, the &quot;short ballot&quot; is used. The short ballot displays the names of the candidates for president and vice president, rather than the names of prospective electors. Some states support voting for write-in candidates. Those that do may require pre-registration of write-in candidacy, with designation of electors being done at that time. Since 1992, all but two states have followed the method of allocating electors by which every person named on the slate for the ticket winning the statewide popular vote are named as presidential electors.

Maine and Nebraska are the only states not using this method. In those states, the winner of the popular vote in each of its congressional districts is awarded one elector, and the winner of the statewide vote is then awarded the state&#x27;s remaining two electors. This method has been used in Maine since 1972 and in Nebraska since 1992. The Supreme Court previously upheld the power for a state to choose electors on the basis of congressional districts, holding that states possess plenary power to decide how electors are appointed in &quot;McPherson v. Blacker&quot;, .

The Tuesday following the first Monday in November has been fixed as the day for holding federal elections, called the Election Day. After the election, each state prepares seven Certificates of Ascertainment, each listing the candidates for president and vice president, their pledged electors, and the total votes each candidacy received. One certificate is sent, as soon after Election Day as practicable, to the National Archivist in Washington. The Certificates of Ascertainment are mandated to carry the state seal and the signature of the governor, or mayor of D.C.

==== Meetings ====

The Electoral College never meets as one body. Electors meet in their respective state capitals (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the same day (set by Congress as the Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December) at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.

Although procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, The meeting is opened by the election certification official‚Äîoften that state&#x27;s secretary of state or equivalent‚Äîwho reads the certificate of ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.

When the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in New Jersey for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card. In North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.

Under the Electoral Count Act (updated and codified in ), each state&#x27;s electors must complete six certificates of vote. Each Certificate of Vote (or &quot;Certificate of the Vote&quot;) must be signed by all of the electors and a certificate of ascertainment must be attached to each of the certificates of vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote, and copies of the certificates are then sent in the following fashion:
* One is sent by registered mail to the President of the Senate (who usually is the incumbent vice president of the United States);
* Two are sent by registered mail to the Archivist of the United States;
* Two are sent to the state&#x27;s secretary of state; and
* One is sent to the chief judge of the United States district court where those electors met.

A staff member of the president of the Senate collects the certificates of vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress. The certificates are arranged‚Äîunopened‚Äîin alphabetical order and placed in two special mahogany boxes. Alabama through Missouri (including the District of Columbia) are placed in one box and Montana through Wyoming are placed in the other box.

Before 1950, the Secretary of State&#x27;s office oversaw the certifications. Since then, the Office of Federal Register in the Archivist&#x27;s office reviews them to make sure the documents sent to the archive and Congress match, and that all formalities have been followed, sometimes requiring states to correct the documents.

==== Faithless electors ====
An elector votes for each office, but at least one of these votes (president or vice president) must be cast for a person who is not a resident of the same state as that elector. A &quot;faithless elector&quot; is one who does not cast an electoral vote for the candidate of the party for whom that elector pledged to vote. Faithless electors are comparatively rare because electors are generally chosen among those who are already personally committed to a party and party&#x27;s candidate.

Thirty-three states plus the District of Columbia have laws against faithless electors, which were first enforced after the 2016 election, where ten electors voted or attempted to vote contrary to their pledges. Faithless electors have never changed the outcome of a U.S. election for president. Altogether, 23,529 electors have taken part in the Electoral College as of the 2016 election. Only 165 electors have cast votes for someone other than their party&#x27;s nominee. Of that group, 71 did so because the nominee had died63 Democratic Party electors in 1872, when presidential nominee Horace Greeley died; and eight Republican Party electors in 1912, when vice presidential nominee James S. Sherman died.

While faithless electors have never changed the outcome of any presidential election, there are two occasions where the vice presidential election has been influenced by faithless electors:
* In the 1796 election, 18 electors pledged to the Federalist Party ticket cast their first vote as pledged for John Adams, electing him president, but did not cast their second vote for his running mate Thomas Pinckney. As a result, Adams attained 71 electoral votes, Jefferson received 68, and Pinckney received 59, meaning Jefferson, rather than Pinckney, became vice president.
* In the 1836 election, Virginia&#x27;s 23 electors, who were pledged to Richard Mentor Johnson, voted instead for former U.S. senator William Smith, which left Johnson one vote short of the majority needed to be elected. In accordance with the Twelfth Amendment, a contingent election was held in the Senate between the top two receivers of electoral votes, Johnson and Francis Granger, for vice president, with Johnson being elected on the first ballot.
Some constitutional scholars argued that state restrictions would be struck down if challenged based on Article II and the Twelfth Amendment. However, the United States Supreme Court has consistently ruled that state restrictions are allowed under the Constitution. In &quot;Ray v. Blair&quot;, , the court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. As stated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not the federal government. In &quot;Chiafalo v. Washington&quot;, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), and a related case, the court held that electors must vote in accord with their state&#x27;s laws. Faithless electors also may face censure from their political party, as they are usually chosen based on their perceived party loyalty.

=== Joint session of Congress ===
The Twelfth Amendment mandates Congress assemble in joint session to count the electoral votes and declare the winners of the election. The session is ordinarily required to take place on January6 in the calendar year immediately following the meetings of the presidential electors. Since the Twentieth Amendment, the newly elected joint Congress declares the winner of the election. All elections before 1936 were determined by the outgoing House.

The Office of the Federal Register is charged with administering the Electoral College. The meeting is held at 1p.m. in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives. The sitting vice president is expected to preside, but in several cases the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate has chaired the proceedings. The vice president and the speaker of the House sit at the podium, with the vice president sitting to the right of the speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in two mahogany boxes containing each state&#x27;s certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote, normally one member of each political party. Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.

Before an amendment to the law in 2022, members of Congress could object to any state&#x27;s vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. In 2022, the number of members required to make an objection was raised to one-fifth of each house. An appropriately made objection is followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each house of Congress. After both houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed.

A state&#x27;s certificate of vote can be rejected only if both houses of Congress vote to accept the objection via a simple majority, meaning the votes from the state in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted.

If there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state&#x27;s votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.

After the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final state of the vote. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.

==== Historical objections and rejections ====
Objections to the electoral vote count are rarely raised, although it has occurred a few times.
* In 1864, all votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected because of the American Civil War.
* In 1872, all votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes from Georgia were rejected, due to allegations of electoral fraud, and due to submitting votes for a candidate who had died.
* After the crises of the 1876 election, where in a few states it was claimed there were two competing state governments, and thus competing slates of electors, Congress adopted the Electoral Count Act to regularize objection procedure.
* During the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000 presidential election between Governor George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore. The election had been controversial, and its outcome was decided by the court case &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object.
* Objections were raised in the vote count of the 2004 election, alleging voter suppression and machine irregularities in Ohio, and on that occasion one representative and one senator objected, following protocols mandated by the Electoral Count Act. The joint session was suspended as outlined in these protocols, and the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both houses of Congress.
* Eleven objections were raised during the vote count for the 2016 election, all by various Democratic representatives. As no senator joined the representatives in any objection, all objections were blocked by Vice President Joe Biden.
* In the 2020 election, there were two objections, and the proceeding was interrupted by an attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump. Objections to the votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania were each raised by a House member and a senator, and triggered separate debate in each chamber, but were soundly defeated. A few House members raised objections to the votes from Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin, but they could not move forward because no senator joined in those objections.

=== Contingencies ===
==== Contingent presidential election by House ====
If no candidate for president receives an absolute majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes), then the Twelfth Amendment requires the House of Representatives to go into session immediately to choose a president. In this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes &quot;en bloc&quot;‚Äîeach delegation having a single vote. The District of Columbia does not get to vote.

A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., from 1959, which is the last time a new state was admitted to the union, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the &quot;president-elect&quot;. Delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.

The House of Representatives has been required to choose the president only twice: in 1801 under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in 1825 under the Twelfth Amendment.

==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====
If no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the Senate must go into session to choose a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote.

However, the text is written in such a way that &quot;all&quot; candidates with the most and second-most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election‚Äîthis number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). Two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.

The Twelfth Amendment states a &quot;majority of the whole number&quot; of senators, currently 51 of 100, is necessary for election. The language requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting vice president from breaking any tie that might occur, although some academics and journalists have speculated to the contrary.

The only time the Senate chose the vice president was in 1837. In that instance, the Senate adopted an alphabetical roll call and voting aloud. The rules further stated, &quot;[I]f a majority of the number of senators shall vote for either the said Richard M. Johnson or Francis Granger, he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States&quot;; the Senate chose Johnson.

==== Deadlocked election ====
Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment specifies that if the House of Representatives has not chosen a &quot;president-elect&quot; in time for the inauguration (noon EST on January 20), then the &quot;vice president-elect&quot; becomes acting president until the House selects a president. Section3 also specifies that Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president. Neither of these situations has ever arisen to this day.

====Continuity of government and peaceful transitions of power====
In &quot;Federalist No. 68&quot;, Alexander Hamilton argued that one concern that led the Constitutional Convention to create the Electoral College was to ensure peaceful transitions of power and continuity of government during transitions between presidential administrations. While recognizing that the question had not been presented in the case, the U.S. Supreme Court stated in the majority opinion in &quot;Chiafalo v. Washington&quot; (2020) that &quot;nothing in this opinion should be taken to permit the States to bind electors to a deceased candidate&quot; after noting that more than one-third of the cumulative faithless elector votes in U.S. presidential elections history were cast during the 1872 presidential election when Liberal Republican Party and Democratic Party nominee Horace Greeley died after the polls were held and vote tabulations were completed by the states but before the Electoral College cast its ballots, and acknowledging the petitioners concern about the potential turmoil that the death of a presidential candidate between Election Day and the Electoral College meetings could cause.

In 1872, Greeley carried the popular vote in 6 states (Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas) and had 66 electoral votes pledged to him. After his death on November 29, 1872, 63 of the electors pledged to him voted faithlessly, while 3 votes (from Georgia) that remained pledged to him were rejected at the Electoral College vote count on February 12, 1873, on the grounds that he had died. Greeley&#x27;s running mate, B. Gratz Brown, still received the 3 electoral votes from Georgia for vice president that were rejected for Greeley. This brought Brown&#x27;s number of electoral votes for vice president to 47 since he still received all 28 electoral votes from Maryland, Tennessee, and Texas, and 16 other electoral votes from Georgia, Kentucky, and Missouri in total. The other 19 electors from the latter states voted faithlessly for vice president.

During the presidential transition following the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln had to arrive in Washington, D.C. in disguise and on an altered train schedule after the Pinkerton National Detective Agency found evidence that suggested a secessionist plot to assassinate Lincoln would be attempted in Baltimore. During the presidential transition following the 1928 presidential election, an Argentine anarchist group plotted to assassinate Herbert Hoover while Hoover was traveling through Central and South America and crossing the Andes from Chile by train. The plotters were arrested before the attempt was made.

During the presidential transition following the 1932 presidential election, Giuseppe Zangara attempted to assassinate Franklin D. Roosevelt by gunshot while Roosevelt was giving an impromptu speech in a car in Miami, but instead killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was a passenger in the car, and wounded 5 bystanders. During the presidential transition following the 1960 presidential election, Richard Paul Pavlick plotted to assassinate John F. Kennedy while Kennedy was vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, by detonating a dynamite-laden car where Kennedy was staying. Pavlick delayed his attempt and was arrested and committed to a mental hospital.

During the presidential transition following the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama was targeted in separate security incidents by an assassination plot and a death threat, after an assassination plot in Denver during the 2008 Democratic National Convention and an assassination plot in Tennessee during the election were prevented.

During the presidential transition following the 2020 presidential election, as a result of former president Donald Trump&#x27;s false insistence that he had won the election, the General Services Administration did not declare Biden the winner until November 23. The subsequent attack on the United States Capitol on January 6 caused delays in the counting of electoral votes to certify Joe Biden&#x27;s victory in the 2020 election, but was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the count from occurring.

Ratified in 1933, Section 3 of the 20th Amendment requires that if a president-elect dies before Inauguration Day, that the vice president-elect becomes the president. Akhil Amar has noted that the explicit text of the 20th Amendment does not specify when the candidates of the winning presidential ticket officially become the president-elect and vice president-elect, and that the text of Article II, Section I and the 12th Amendment suggests that candidates for president and vice president are only formally elected upon the Electoral College vote count. Conversely, a 2020 report issued by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), stated that the balance of scholarly opinion has concluded that the winning presidential ticket is formally elected as soon as the majority of the electoral votes they receive are cast, according to the 1932 House committee report on the 20th Amendment.

If a vacancy on a presidential ticket occurs before Election Day‚Äîas in 1912 when Republican nominee for Vice President James S. Sherman died less than a week before the election and was replaced by Nicholas Murray Butler at the Electoral College meetings, and in 1972 when Democratic nominee for Vice President Thomas Eagleton withdrew his nomination less than three weeks after the Democratic National Convention and was replaced by Sargent Shriver‚Äîthe internal rules of the political parties apply for filling vacancies. If a vacancy on a presidential ticket occurs between Election Day and the Electoral College meetings, the 2020 CRS report notes that most legal commentators have suggested that political parties would still follow their internal rules for filling the vacancies. However, in 1872, the Democratic National Committee did not meet to name a replacement for Horace Greeley, and the 2020 CRS report notes that presidential electors may argue that they are permitted to vote faithlessly if a vacancy occurs between Election Day and the Electoral College meetings since they were pledged to vote for a specific candidate.

Under the Presidential Succession Clause of Article II, Section I, Congress is delegated the power to &quot;by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.&quot; Pursuant to the Presidential Succession Clause, the 2nd United States Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 that required a special election by the Electoral College in the case of a dual vacancy in the presidency and vice presidency. Despite vacancies in the Vice Presidency from 1792 to 1886, the special election requirement would be repealed with the rest of the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 by the 49th United States Congress in passing the Presidential Succession Act of 1886.

In a special message to the 80th United States Congress calling for revisions to the Presidential Succession Act of 1886, President Harry S. Truman proposed restoring special elections for dual vacancies in the Presidency and Vice Presidency. While most of Truman&#x27;s proposal was included in the final version of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the restoration of special elections for dual vacancies was not. Along with six other recommendations related to presidential succession, the Continuity of Government Commission recommended restoring special elections for president in the event of a dual vacancy in the presidency and vice presidency due to a catastrophic terrorist attack or nuclear strike, in part because all members of the presidential line of succession live and work in Washington, D.C.

Under the 12th Amendment, presidential electors are still required to meet and cast their ballots for president and vice president within their respective states. The CRS noted in a separate 2020 report that members of the presidential line of succession, after the vice president, only become an acting president under the Presidential Succession Clause and Section 3 of the 20th Amendment, rather than fully succeeding to the presidency.

=== Current electoral vote distribution ===

: * &quot;The Twenty-third Amendment grants the same number of electors as the least populous state. This has always been three.&quot;

== Alternative methods of choosing electors ==


Before the advent of the &quot;short ballot&quot; in the early 20th century (as described in Selection process) the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the &quot;general ticket&quot;. The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector. In the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors.

In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times. It was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932. Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.

The question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature&#x27;s choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In &quot;McPherson v. Blacker&quot;, , the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause2 which states that a state&#x27;s electors are selected &quot;in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct&quot; and wrote these words &quot;operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power&quot;.

In &quot;Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board&quot;, , a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on &quot;McPherson&quot;. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, , wrote: &quot;[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.&quot;

=== Appointment by state legislature ===
In the earliest presidential elections, state legislative choice was the most common method of choosing electors. A majority of the state legislatures selected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of them did so in 1812. Even in the 1824 election, a quarter of state legislatures (6 of 24) chose electors. In that election, Andrew Jackson lost in spite of having a plurality of both the popular vote and the number of electoral votes representing them. Yet, as six states did not hold a popular election for their electoral votes, the full expression of the popular vote nationally cannot be known.

Some state legislatures simply chose electors. Other states used a hybrid method in which state legislatures chose from a group of electors elected by popular vote. By 1828, with the rise of Jacksonian democracy, only Delaware and South Carolina used legislative choice. Delaware ended its practice the following election (1832). South Carolina continued using the method until it seceded from the Union in December 1860. South Carolina used the popular vote for the first time in the 1868 election.

Excluding South Carolina, legislative appointment was used in only four situations after 1832:
* In 1848, Massachusetts statute awarded the state&#x27;s electoral votes to the winner of the at-large popular vote, but only if that candidate won an absolute majority. When the vote produced no winner between the Democratic, Free Soil, and Whig parties, the state legislature selected the electors, giving all 12 electoral votes to the Whigs, which had won the plurality of votes in the state.
* In 1864, Nevada, having joined the Union only a few days prior to Election Day, had no choice but to legislatively appoint.
* In 1868, the newly reconstructed state of Florida legislatively appointed its electors, having been readmitted too late to hold elections.
* In 1876, the legislature of the newly admitted state of Colorado used legislative choice due to a lack of time and money to hold a popular election.
Legislative appointment was brandished as a possibility in the 2000 election. Had the recount continued, the Florida legislature was prepared to appoint the Republican slate of electors to avoid missing the federal safe-harbor deadline for choosing electors.

The Constitution gives each state legislature the power to decide how its state&#x27;s electors are chosen and it can be easier and cheaper for a state legislature to simply appoint a slate of electors than to create a legislative framework for holding elections to determine the electors. As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: bicameral legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.

=== Electoral districts ===
Another method used early in U.S. history was to divide the state into electoral districts. By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated into congressional districts. The difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, this method is vulnerable to gerrymandering.

=== Congressional district method ===

There are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another was used in New York in 1828 and proposed for use in Virginia. Under the implemented method, electors are awarded the way seats in Congress are awarded. One electoral vote goes per the plurality of the popular votes of each congressional district (for the U.S. House Of Representatives), and two per the statewide popular vote. This may result in greater proportionality. But it can give results similar to the winner-takes-all states, as in 1992, when George H. W. Bush won all five of Nebraska&#x27;s electoral votes with a clear plurality on 47% of the vote; in a truly proportional system, he would have received three and Bill Clinton and Ross Perot each would have received one.

In 2013, the Virginia proposal was tabled. Like the other congressional district methods, this would have distributed the electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia&#x27;s 11 congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional districts. A similar method was used in New York in 1828: the two at large electors were elected by the electors selected in districts.

A congressional district method is more likely to arise than other alternatives to the winner-takes-whole-state method, in view of the main two parties&#x27; resistance to scrap first-past-the-post. State legislation is sufficient to use this method. Advocates of the method believe the system encourages higher voter turnout or incentivizes candidates, to visit and appeal to some states deemed safe, overall, for one party.

Winner-take-all systems ignore thousands of votes. In Democratic California there are Republican districts, in Republican Texas there are Democratic districts. Because candidates have an incentive to campaign in competitive districts, with a district plan, candidates have an incentive to actively campaign in over thirty states versus about seven &quot;swing&quot; states. Opponents of the system argue that candidates might only spend time in certain battleground districts instead of the entire state and cases of gerrymandering could become exacerbated as political parties attempt to draw as many safe districts as they can.

Unlike simple congressional district comparisons, the district plan popular vote bonus in the 2008 election would have given Obama 56% of the Electoral College versus the 68% he did win; it &quot;would have more closely approximated the percentage of the popular vote won [53%]&quot;. However, the district plan would have given Obama 49% of the Electoral College in 2012, and would have given Romney a win in the Electoral College even though Obama won the popular vote by nearly 4% (51.1‚Äì47.2) over Romney.

==== Implementation ====
Of the 44 multi-district states whose 517 electoral votes are amenable to the method, only Maine (4 EV) and Nebraska (5 EV) apply it. Maine began using the congressional district method in the election of 1972. Nebraska has used the congressional district method since the election of 1992. Michigan used the system for the 1892 presidential election, and several other states used various forms of the district plan before 1840: Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, and New York.

The congressional district method allows a state the chance to split its electoral votes between multiple candidates. Prior to 2008, Nebraska had never split its electoral votes, while Maine had only done so once under its previous district plan in the 1828 election. Nebraska split its electoral votes for the first time in 2008, giving John McCain its statewide electors and those of two congressional districts, while Barack Obama won the electoral vote of Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, centered on the state&#x27;s largest city, Omaha. Following the 2008 split, some Nebraska Republicans made efforts to discard the congressional district method and return to the winner-takes-all system. In January 2010, a bill was introduced in the Nebraska legislature to revert to a winner-take-all system; the bill died in committee in March 2011. Republicans had passed bills in 1995 and 1997 to do the same, which were vetoed by Democratic Governor Ben Nelson.

More recently, Maine split its electoral votes for the first time under the congressional district method in 2016. Hillary Clinton won its two statewide electors and its 1st congressional district, which covers the state&#x27;s southwestern coastal region and its largest city of Portland, while Donald Trump won the electoral vote of Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, which takes in the remainder of the state and is much larger by area. In the 2020 election, both Nebraska and Maine split their electoral votes, following the same pattern of congressional district differences that were seen in 2008 and 2016 respectively: Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district voted for Democrat Joe Biden while the remainder of the state voted for Republican Donald Trump; and Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district voted for Trump while the remainder of the state voted for Biden.

====Recent abandoned adoption in other states====
In 2010, Republicans in Pennsylvania, who controlled both houses of the legislature as well as the governorship, put forward a plan to change the state&#x27;s winner-takes-all system to a congressional district method system. Pennsylvania had voted for the Democratic candidate in the five previous presidential elections, so this was seen an attempt to take away Democratic electoral votes. Democrat Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008 with 55% of its vote. The district plan would have awarded him 11 of its 21 electoral votes, a 52.4% which was much closer to the popular vote percentage. The plan later lost support. Other Republicans, including Michigan state representative Pete Lund, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have floated similar ideas.

=== Proportional vote ===
In a proportional system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.

== Impacts and reception ==

Gary Bugh&#x27;s research of congressional debates over proposed constitutional amendments to abolish the Electoral College reveals reform opponents have often appealed to tradition and the preference for indirect elections, whereas reform advocates often champion a more egalitarian one person, one vote system. Electoral colleges have been scrapped by all other democracies around the world in favor of direct elections for an executive president.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is less democratic than a national direct popular vote and is subject to manipulation because of faithless electors; that the system is antithetical to a democracy that strives for a standard of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;; and there can be elections where one candidate wins the national popular vote but another wins the electoral vote, as in the 2000 and 2016 elections. Individual citizens in less populated states with 5% of the Electoral College have proportionately more voting power than those in more populous states, and candidates can win by focusing on just a few &quot;swing states&quot;.

=== Polling ~40% ===
21st century polling data shows that a majority of Americans consistently favor having a direct popular vote for presidential elections. The popularity of the Electoral College has hovered between 35% and 44%.

=== Difference with popular vote ===

Opponents of the Electoral College claim such outcomes do not logically follow the normative concept of how a democratic system should function. One view is the Electoral College violates the principle of political equality, since presidential elections are not decided by the one-person one-vote principle.

While many assume the national popular vote observed under the Electoral College system would reflect the popular vote observed under a National Popular Vote system, supporters contend that is not necessarily the case as each electoral institution produces different incentives for, and strategy choices by, presidential campaigns.

==== Notable elections ====
The elections of 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016 produced an Electoral College winner who did not receive at least a plurality of the nationwide popular vote. In 1824, there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so it is uncertain what the national popular vote would have been if all presidential electors had been popularly elected. When no presidential candidate received a majority of electoral votes in 1824, the election was decided by the House of Representatives and so could be considered distinct from the latter four elections in which all of the states had popular selection of electors. The true national popular vote was also uncertain in the 1960 election, and the plurality for the winner depends on how votes for Alabama electors are allocated.

Elections where the popular vote and electoral college results differed
* 1800: Jefferson won with 61.4% of the popular vote; Adams had 38.6%*
* 1824: Adams won with 30.9% of the popular vote; Jackson had 41.4%*
* 1836 (only for vice president): Johnson won with 63.5% of the popular vote; Granger had 30.8%*
* 1876: Tilden (D) received 50.9% of the vote, Hayes (R) received 47.9%
* 1888: Cleveland (D) received 48.6% of the vote, Harrison (R) received 47.8%
* 2000: Gore (D) received 48.4% of the vote, Bush (R) received 47.9%
* 2016: Clinton (D) received 48.2% of the vote, Trump (R) received 46.1%
&quot;*These popular vote tallies are partial because several of the states still used their legislature to choose electors not a popular vote. In both elections a tied electoral college threw the contest over to Congress to decide.&quot;

=== Favors largest swing states ===

The Electoral College encourages political campaigners to focus on a few so-called swing states while ignoring the rest of the country. Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while four out of five voters in the national election are &quot;absolutely ignored&quot;, according to one assessment. Since most states use a winner-takes-all arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state&#x27;s electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states.

=== Not all votes count the same ===
Each state gets a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of population, which has increasingly given low-population states more electors per voter (or more voting power). For example, an electoral vote represents nearly four times as many people in California as in Wyoming. On average, voters in the ten least populated states have 2.5 more electors per person compared with voters in the ten most populous states.

In 1968, John F. Banzhaf III developed the Banzhaf power index (BPI) which argued that a voter in the state of New York had, on average, 3.3 times as much voting power in presidential elections as the average voter outside New York. Mark Livingston used a similar method and estimated that individual voters in the largest state, based on the 1990 census, had 3.3 times more individual power to choose a president than voters of Montana.

However, others argue that Banzhaf&#x27;s method ignores the demographic makeup of the states and treats votes like independent coin-flips. Critics of Banzhaf&#x27;s method say empirically based models used to analyze the Electoral College have consistently found that sparsely populated states benefit from having their resident&#x27;s votes count for more than the votes of those residing in the more populous states.

=== Lowers turnout ===
Except in closely fought swing states, voter turnout does not affect the election results due to entrenched political party domination in most states. The Electoral College decreases the advantage a political party or campaign might gain for encouraging voters to turn out, except in those swing states. If the presidential election were decided by a national popular vote, in contrast, campaigns and parties would have a strong incentive to work to increase turnout everywhere.

Individuals would similarly have a stronger incentive to persuade their friends and neighbors to turn out to vote. The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.

=== Obscures disenfranchisement within states ===
According to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems &quot;within&quot; a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by voter suppression methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally disfranchising specific groups (like women or people of color), then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state&#x27;s electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on its overall electoral power. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is not penalized by the Electoral College.

A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state&#x27;s electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranchising subgroups of citizens.

Legal scholars Akhil Amar and Vikram Amar have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations. It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout and prevent Northern dominance within the federation by using the Three-Fifths Compromise. They noted that James Madison believed the question of counting slaves had presented a serious challenge, but that &quot;the substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to the fewest objections.&quot; Akhil and Vikram Amar added:
After the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, white voters in Southern states benefited from elimination of the Three-Fifths Compromise because with all former slaves counted as one person, instead of 3/5, Southern states increased their share of electors in the Electoral College. Southern states also enacted laws that restricted access to voting by former slaves, thereby increasing the electoral weight of votes by southern whites.

Minorities tend to be disproportionately located in noncompetitive states, reducing their impact on the overall election and over-representing white voters who have tended to live in the swing states that decide elections.

=== Americans in U.S. territories cannot vote ===
Roughly four million Americans in Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam, do not have a vote in presidential elections. Only U.S. states (per Article II, Section 1, Clause 2) and Washington, D.C. (per the Twenty-third Amendment) are entitled to electors. Various scholars consequently conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic. Guam has held non-binding straw polls for president since the 1980s to draw attention to this fact. The Democratic and Republican parties, as well as other third parties, have, however, made it possible for people in U.S. territories to vote in party presidential primaries.

=== Disadvantages third parties ===
In practice, the winner-take-all manner of allocating a state&#x27;s electors generally decreases the importance of minor parties.

=== Federalism and state power ===
For many years early in the nation&#x27;s history, up until the Jacksonian Era (1830s), many states appointed their electors by a vote of the state legislature, and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government, to the detriment of the States.

In his 2007 book &quot;A More Perfect Constitution&quot;, Professor Larry Sabato preferred allocating the electoral college (and Senate seats) in stricter proportion to population while keeping the Electoral College for the benefit of lightly populated swing states and to strengthen the role of the states in federalism.

Willamette University College of Law professor Norman R. Williams has argued that the Constitutional Convention delegates chose the Electoral College to choose the president largely in reaction to the experience during the Confederation period where state governors were often chosen by state legislatures and wanting the new federal government to have an executive branch that was effectively independent of the legislative branch. For example, Alexander Hamilton argued that the Electoral College would prevent, sinister bias, foreign interference and domestic intrigue in presidential elections by not permitting members of Congress or any other officer of the United States to serve as electors.

== Efforts to abolish or reform ==

More resolutions have been submitted to amend the U.S. Electoral College mechanism than any other part of the constitution. Since 1800, over 700 proposals to reform or eliminate the system have been introduced in Congress. Proponents of these proposals argued that the electoral college system does not provide for direct democratic election, affords less-populous states an advantage, and allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the most votes. None of these proposals has received the approval of two thirds of Congress and three fourths of the states required to amend the Constitution. Ziblatt and Levitsky argue that America has by far the most difficult constitution to amend, which is why reform efforts have stalled in America.

=== 1969‚Äì1970: Bayh‚ÄìCeller amendment ===
The closest the United States has come to abolishing the Electoral College occurred during the 91st Congress (1969‚Äì1971). The 1968 election resulted in Richard Nixon receiving 301 electoral votes (56% of electors), Hubert Humphrey 191 (35.5%), and George Wallace 46 (8.5%) with 13.5% of the popular vote. However, Nixon had received only 511,944 more popular votes than Humphrey, 43.5% to 42.9%, less than 1% of the national total.

Representative Emanuel Celler (D‚ÄìNew York), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, responded to public concerns over the disparity between the popular vote and electoral vote by introducing House Joint Resolution 681, a proposed Constitutional amendment that would have replaced the Electoral College with a simpler plurality system based on the national popular vote. With this system, the pair of candidates (running for president and vice-president) who had received the highest number of votes would win the presidency and vice presidency provided they won at least 40% of the national popular vote. If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election.

On April 29, 1969, the House Judiciary Committee voted 28 to6 to approve the proposal. Debate on the proposal before the full House of Representatives ended on September 11, 1969 and was eventually passed with bipartisan support on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339 to 70.

On September 30, 1969, President Nixon gave his endorsement for adoption of the proposal, encouraging the Senate to pass its version of the proposal, which had been sponsored as Senate Joint Resolution1 by Senator Birch Bayh (D‚ÄìIndiana).

On October 8, 1969, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that 30 state legislatures were &quot;either certain or likely to approve a constitutional amendment embodying the direct election plan if it passes its final Congressional test in the Senate.&quot; Ratification of 38 state legislatures would have been needed for adoption. The paper also reported that six other states had yet to state a preference, six were leaning toward opposition, and eight were solidly opposed.

On August 14, 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent its report advocating passage of the proposal to the full Senate. The Judiciary Committee had approved the proposal by a vote of 11 to 6. The six members who opposed the plan, Democratic senators James Eastland of Mississippi, John Little McClellan of Arkansas, and Sam Ervin of North Carolina, along with Republican senators Roman Hruska of Nebraska, Hiram Fong of Hawaii, and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, all argued that although the present system had potential loopholes, it had worked well throughout the years. Senator Bayh indicated that supporters of the measure were about a dozen votes shy from the 67 needed for the proposal to pass the full Senate. He called upon President Nixon to attempt to persuade undecided Republican senators to support the proposal. However, Nixon, while not reneging on his previous endorsement, chose not to make any further personal appeals to back the proposal.

On September 8, 1970, the Senate commenced openly debating the proposal, and the proposal was quickly filibustered. The lead objectors to the proposal were mostly Southern senators and conservatives from small states, both Democrats and Republicans, who argued that abolishing the Electoral College would reduce their states&#x27; political influence. On September 17, 1970, a motion for cloture, which would have ended the filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for cloture, failing to receive the then-required two-thirds majority of senators voting. A second motion for cloture on September 29, 1970, also failed, by 53 to 34. Thereafter, the Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield of Montana, moved to lay the proposal aside so the Senate could attend to other business. However, the proposal was never considered again and died when the 91st Congress ended on January 3, 1971.

=== Carter proposal ===
On March 22, 1977, President Jimmy Carter wrote a letter of reform to Congress that also included his expression of abolishing the Electoral College. The letter read in part:

President Carter&#x27;s proposed program for the reform of the Electoral College was very liberal for a modern president during this time, and in some aspects of the package, it went beyond original expectations.
Newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw President Carter&#x27;s proposal at that time as &quot;a modest surprise&quot; because of the indication of Carter that he would be interested in only eliminating the electors but retaining the electoral vote system in a modified form.

Newspaper reaction to Carter&#x27;s proposal ranged from some editorials praising the proposal to other editorials, like that in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, criticizing the president for proposing the end of the Electoral College.

In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Representative Jonathan B. Bingham (D-New York) highlighted the danger of the &quot;flawed, outdated mechanism of the Electoral College&quot; by underscoring how a shift of fewer than 10,000 votes in two key states would have led to President Gerald Ford winning the 1976 election despite Jimmy Carter&#x27;s nationwide 1.7 million-vote margin.

=== Recent proposals to abolish ===
Since January 3, 2019, joint resolutions have been made proposing constitutional amendments that would replace the Electoral College with the popular election of the president and vice president. Unlike the Bayh‚ÄìCeller amendment, with its 40% threshold for election, these proposals do not require a candidate to achieve a certain percentage of votes to be elected.

=== National Popular Vote Interstate Compact ===

As of April 2024, seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Those joining the compact will, acting together if and when reflecting a majority of electors (at least 270), pledge their electors to the winner of the national popular vote. The compact applies Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution, which gives each state legislature the plenary power to determine how it chooses electors.

Some scholars have suggested that Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution requires congressional consent before the compact could be enforceable; thus, any attempted implementation of the compact without congressional consent could face court challenges to its constitutionality. Others have suggested that the compact&#x27;s legality was strengthened by &quot;Chiafalo v. Washington&quot;, in which the Supreme Court upheld the power of states to enforce electors&#x27; pledges.

The eighteen adherents of the compact have 209 electors, which is 77% of the 270 required for it to take effect, or be considered justiciable.

=== Litigation based on the 14th amendment ===
It has been argued by the advocacy group Equal Citizens that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution bars the winner-takes-all apportionment of electors by the states. According to this argument, the votes of the losing party are discarded entirely, thereby leading to an unequal position between different voters in the same state. Lawsuits have been filed to this end in California, Massachusetts, Texas and South Carolina, though all have been unsuccessful.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, the dii (also di) Novensiles or Novensides are collective deities of obscure significance found in inscriptions, prayer formulary, and both ancient and early-Christian literary texts.

In antiquity, the initial element of the word &quot;novensiles&quot; was thought to derive from either &quot;new&quot; (&quot;novus&quot;) or &quot;nine&quot; (&quot;novem&quot;). The form &quot;novensides&quot; has been explained as &quot;new settlers,&quot; from &quot;novus&quot; and &quot;insidere&quot;, &quot;to settle&quot;. The enduringly influential 19th-century scholar Georg Wissowa thought that the &quot;novensiles&quot; or &quot;novensides&quot; were deities the Romans regarded as imported, that is, not indigenous like the &quot;di Indigetes&quot;.

Although Wissowa treated the categories of &quot;indigetes&quot; and &quot;novensiles&quot; as a fundamental way to classify Roman gods, the distinction is hard to maintain; many scholars reject it. Arnaldo Momigliano pointed out that no ancient text poses &quot;novensiles&quot; and &quot;indigetes&quot; as a dichotomy, and that the etymology of &quot;novensides&quot; is far from settled. In his treatise on orthography, the 4th-century philosopher Marius Victorinus regarded the spellings &quot;novensiles&quot; and &quot;novensides&quot; as a simple phonetic alteration of &quot;l&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, characteristic of the Sabine language. Some ancient sources say the &quot;novensiles&quot; are nine in number, leading to both ancient and modern identifications with other divine collectives numbering nine, such as the nine Etruscan deities empowered to wield thunder or with the Muses. The name is thus sometimes spelled Novemsiles or Novemsides.

It may be that only the cults of deities considered indigenous were first established within the sacred boundary of Rome (&quot;pomerium&quot;), with &quot;new&quot; gods on the Aventine Hill or in the Campus Martius, but it is uncertain whether the terms &quot;indigetes&quot; and &quot;novensiles&quot; correspond to this topography. William Warde Fowler observed that at any rate a distinction between &quot;indigenous&quot; and &quot;imported&quot; begins to vanish during the Hannibalic War, when immigrant deities are regularly invoked for the protection of the state.

==The invocation of Decius Mus==

The &quot;novensiles&quot; are invoked in a list of deities in a prayer formula preserved by the Augustan historian Livy. The prayer is uttered by Decius Mus (consul 340 BC) during the Samnite Wars as part of his vow (&quot;devotio&quot;) to offer himself as a sacrifice to the infernal gods when a battle between the Romans and the Latins has become desperate. Although Livy was writing at a time when Augustus cloaked religious innovation under appeals to old-fashioned piety and traditionalism, archaic aspects of the prayer suggest that it represents a traditional formulary as might be preserved in the official pontifical books. The other deities invoked ‚Äî among them the Archaic Triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, as well as the Lares and Manes ‚Äî belong to the earliest religious traditions of Rome. Livy even explains that he will record the archaic ritual of &quot;devotio&quot; at length because &quot;the memory of every human and religious custom has withered from a preference for everything novel and foreign.&quot; That the &quot;novensiles&quot; would appear in such a list at all, and before the &quot;indigetes&quot;, is surprising if they are &quot;new.&quot;

Both the Lares and the Manes are &quot;native&quot; gods often regarded in ancient sources as the deified dead. Servius says that the &quot;novensiles&quot; are &quot;old gods&quot; who earned numinous status (&quot;dignitatem numinis&quot;) through their &quot;virtus&quot;, their quality of character. The early Christian apologist Arnobius notes other authorities who also regarded them as mortals who became gods. In this light, the &quot;novensiles&quot;, like the Lares and Manes, may be &quot;concerned with the subterranean world where ancestors were sleeping.&quot;

==Sabine origin==
According to Arnobius, a Piso, most likely the Calpurnius Piso Frugi who was an annalist and consul in 133 BC, said that the &quot;novensiles&quot; were nine gods whose cult had been established in Sabine country at Trebia. The location has been identified variously as the river Trebbia, Trevi nel Lazio, or one of the places called Trebula in antiquity, two of which ‚Äî Trebula Mutusca and Trebula Suffenas ‚Äî are in Sabine territory. Gary Forsythe has conjectured that Piso&#x27;s family came from the middle Tiber Valley, on the border of Etruria and Sabine country, and that he was drawing on personal knowledge. The father of this Piso is probably the L. Calpurnius who dedicated a shrine to Feronia at &quot;Lucus Feroniae&quot; near Capena.

Varro, who was himself Sabine, placed the &quot;Novensides&quot; in his much-noted catalogue of Sabine deities. Inscriptions in Sabine country mention the &quot;novensiles&quot; or &quot;novensides&quot;, for instance, &quot;dieu. nove. sede&quot; at Pisaurum. A Marsian inscription also names the &quot;novensiles&quot; without the &quot;indigetes&quot;. The 19th-century scholar Edward Greswell sought to connect the nine &quot;novensiles&quot; of the Sabines to the nundinal cycle, the eight-day &quot;week&quot; of the Roman calendar that Roman inclusive counting reckoned as nine days.

==Nine deities==
A 4th- or 3rd-century BC inscription from Ardea reading &quot;neven deivo&quot; has been taken to refer to the Novensiles as nine deities. Granius Flaccus and Aelius Stilo, Arnobius says, identify the &quot;Novensiles&quot; with the Muses, implying that they are nine in number. In the Roman tradition, the Muses became identified with the Camenae, the Latin goddesses of fresh-water sources and prophetic inspiration. The two best-known of the Camenae were Carmentis (or Carmenta), who had her own flamen and in whose honor the Carmentalia was held, and Egeria, the divine consort of Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome considered the founder of Roman law and religion. Numa had established a bronze shrine at the fountain in their grove, the site of his divine union with Egeria. The fountain of the Camenae was a source of water for the Vestals.

The 5th-century scholar Martianus Capella placed the &quot;Dii Novensiles&quot; within his Etruscan-influenced celestial schema in his work &quot;On the Marriage of Mercury and Philology&quot;, and took their name as meaning &quot;nine.&quot; He locates the &quot;Novensiles&quot; in the second region of the heavens, with Jove, Mars Quirinus, the &quot;Military Lar,&quot; Juno, Fons (&quot;Fountain&quot; or &quot;Source&quot;), and the Lymphae (fresh-water goddesses).

==Council on lightning==
Pliny mentions nine gods of the Etruscans who had the power of wielding thunderbolts, pointing toward Martianus&#x27;s Novensiles as gods pertaining to the use of thunder and lightning &quot;(fulgura)&quot; as signs. Books on how to read lightning were one of the three main branches of the &quot;disciplina Etrusca&quot;, the body of Etruscan religious and divinatory teachings. Within the Etruscan discipline, Jupiter has the power to wield three types of admonitory lightning &quot;(manubiae)&quot; sent from three different celestial regions. The first of these, mild or &quot;perforating&quot; lightning, is a beneficial form meant to persuade or dissuade. The other two types are harmful or &quot;crushing&quot; lightning, for which Jupiter requires the approval of the Di Consentes, and completely destructive or &quot;burning&quot; lighting, which requires the approval of the &quot;di superiores et involuti&quot; (hidden gods of the &quot;higher&quot; sphere).

Several scholars have identified the Novensiles with the council of gods who decide on the use of the third, most destructive type of lightning. Carl Thulin proposed that two from the Piacenza Liver ‚Äî a bronze model of a sheep&#x27;s liver covered with Etruscan inscriptions pertaining to haruspicy ‚Äî ought to be identified with the two councils, &quot;Cilens(l)&quot; with the Novensiles and &quot;Thufltha(s)&quot; with the &quot;Consentes Penates&quot;. The Novensiles would thus correspond to the &quot;di superiores et involuti&quot; and possibly the &quot;Favores Opertanei&quot; (&quot;Secret Gods of Favor&quot;) referred to by Martianus Capella. Martianus, however, locates the &quot;Favores&quot; in the first region of the sky, with the &quot;Di Consentes&quot; and Penates, and the Novensiles in the second; the &quot;Favores&quot; are perhaps the &quot;Fata&quot;, &quot;Fates&quot;.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Ops or Opis (Latin: &quot;Plenty&quot;) was a fertility deity and earth goddess of Sabine origin. Her equivalent in Greek mythology was Rhea.

==Iconography==
In Ops&#x27;s statues and coins, she is figured sitting down, as Chthonian deities normally are, and generally holds a scepter, or a corn spray and cornucopia. In Roman mythology the husband of Ops was Saturn. Ops is identified as Rhea in Greek mythology, whose husband was Cronus, the bountiful monarch of the golden age; Cronus was Rhea&#x27;s brother.

==Name==
In Latin writings of the time, the singular nominative (&quot;Ops&quot;) is not attested; only the form &quot;Opis&quot; is used by classical authors. According to Festus (203:19), &quot;Ops is said to be the wife of Saturn and the daughter of Caelus. By her they designated the earth, because the earth distributes all goods to the human genus&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

The Latin word &quot;ops&quot; means &quot;riches, goods, abundance, gifts, munificence, plenty&quot;. The word is also related to &quot;opus&quot;, which means &quot;work&quot;, particularly in the sense of &quot;working the earth, ploughing, sowing&quot;. This activity was deemed sacred, and was often attended by religious rites intended to obtain the good will of chthonic deities such as Ops and Consus. &quot;Ops&quot; is also related to the Sanskrit word &quot;√°pnas&quot; (&quot;goods, property&quot;).

==Worship==
According to Roman tradition, the cult of Opis was instituted by Titus Tatius, one of the Sabine kings of Rome. Opis soon became the matron of riches, abundance, and prosperity. Opis had a famous temple in the Capitolium. Originally, a festival took place in Opis&#x27;s honor on August¬†10. Additionally, on December¬†19 (some say December¬†9), the Opalia was celebrated. On August¬†25, the Opiconsivia was held. Opiconsivia was another name used for Opis, indicating when the earth was sown. These festivals also included activities that were called Consualia, in honor of Consus, her consort.

==Mythology and literature==
When Saturn (as Cronus) learned of a prophecy that his children by Opis would overthrow him, he ate his children one by one as they were born. Opis could not just stand by, so instead of giving Saturn their final child, Jupiter, she wrapped a rock in swaddling clothes, and fed the stone to Saturn instead of Jupiter. Opis then went on to raise Jupiter in secret, and then helped him free his siblings from their father&#x27;s stomach.

She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 1361‚Äì1362. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

<text>Opis (Akkadian &quot;Up√Æ&quot; or &quot;Upija/Upiya&quot;; ) was an ancient Near East city near the Tigris, not far from modern Baghdad. The equivalence of Opis and Upi are now usually assumed but not yet proven. Early on it was thought that the ideogram for Upi might refer to Kesh or Akshak. Its location is not yet known with certainty though Tall al-MujailƒÅt has been proposed. That site has also been suggested as the location of the ancient city of Akshak.

==Location==
Akkadian and Greek texts indicate that it was located on the east side of the Tigris, near the Diyala River. 
The precise site of the city has been uncertain for a long time, though at one point thought to be near or under the city of Seleucia.
 The site of Tel Abir was also proposed as the location of Opis.

Several texts suggest that Upi is in the same area as the city of Akkad, also unlocated, and in the area between Sippar and Eshnunna.
Recent geographical surveys of ancient Mesopotamia tentatively identify Opis with the mound called Tall al-MujailƒÅt (also Tul≈´l al-Mujaili` or Tul≈´l Mujaili` or el-Mjel&#x27;aat), 20 miles southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, 15 kilometers north of ancient Ctesiphon, and 47 miles northeast of ancient Babylon. The site has an extent of 500 meters by 200 meters with a maximum height of 6.5 meters above the plain. Surface material showed occupation from the Early Dynastic through the Neo-Babylonian periods.

A Kudurru dated to the 13th year of Second Dynasty of Isin ruler Marduk-nadin-ahhe (c. 1095‚Äì1078 BC) was found at Tul≈´l al-Mujaili`. It was recorded at &quot;the city Opis&quot;. The land in question was part of the city of Dur-Sharrkin &quot;Fortress of Sargon&quot; (location unknown). Not to be confused with the much later Neo-Assyrian fortress.

==History==

A text from year 8 of Ur III ruler Shu-Sin (c. 2037‚Äì2028 BC) details a journey of 22 women from Eshnunna to Nippur and back via Upi with the Upi/Nippur leg in both directions being fully on water.

A year name of the Old Babylonian ruler Apil-Sin (c. 1767 to 1749 BC) read &quot;Year Apil-Sin built (the city wall of) Upi&quot; (mu u2-pi2-eki a-pil-den.zu ba-du3).

Early in the reign of Old Babylon Empire ruler Hamurabi, grandson of Apil-Sin, after a conflict between Babylon, Mari, Eshnunna, and Elam resulted in Hamurabi being in control of the Upi area. A text from Mari showed diplomacy over that area&#x27;s disposition:
From a text it is known that the Kassite ruler Burna-Buriash II (c. 1359‚Äì1333 BC) held an audience in Upi.

A Kudurru from the reign of Adad-apla-iddina (c. 1064‚Äì1043) excavated at Assur is dated at Opis.

In one of annals of Neo-Assyrian ruler Sennacherib (705‚Äì681 BC) it states:

The Neo-Babylonians dug the NƒÅr-≈†arri (later NƒÅr-Nab√ª-kudurrƒ´-u·π£ur) canal between the Euphrates and the Tigris, which ended near Opis. The Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (605‚Äì562 BC) built a long wall between the two rivers to protect against a potential Median invasion; the fortified line began at Sippar and continued eastward beyond the Tigris and ended near Opis. In Nebuchadnezzar II year 40, 565 BC, a cuneiform document was written in Opis by a Judean trader, the first attestation of a Judean trader in Babylonia.

In October 539 BC, the troops of the Babylonian king Nabonidus (556‚Äì539 BC) defended Opis against the Persians commanded by Cyrus the Great (559‚Äì530 BC). The Babylonians were defeated and the native population revolted against its government. Without further fighting, Cyrus captured Babylon. Opis was located near the Persian Royal Road, which connected the former Elamite capital Susa to the Assyrian heartland around Erbil and, further to the west, the Lydian capital Sardis. It is known that at the time of Nabonidus the city had a ≈†ang√ª-Upia (‚ÄúHigh-Priest-of-Opis‚Äù).

In September 331 BC, the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (336‚Äì323 BC) defeated Darius III of Persia (336‚Äì330 BC) at the Battle of Gaugamela, and probably took possession of Opis about the same time as Babylon. A few years later, Alexander was forced by a mutiny at the Hyphasis (now Beas) River to return from the long campaign in India, and his European troops revolted again at Opis (autumn 324 BC). In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, he took an oath of unity before 9,000 Persian and Greek troops at Opis. In a similar vein, he had married Stateira (the daughter of Darius) and celebrated a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other Eastern noblewomen at Susa just before coming to Opis.

Seleukos I Nikator (306‚Äì281 BC), one of Alexander&#x27;s Diadochi (Successors), founded the Seleucid Empire and built his Mesopotamian capital Seleukeia west of the river Tigris, some southwest of Opis. The Hellenistic city of Seleukeia rapidly eclipsed older Mesopotamian centers in the region like Babylon, Sippar, and Opis.

In the 2nd century BC, the Parthian Empire conquered the eastern provinces of the Seleucid Empire, including Seleukeia and Opis. Both cities were, in their turn, largely eclipsed by the emergence of the new Parthian (and subsequently Persian) capital Ktesiphon nearby, in-between Seleukeia and Opis.

<text>Orbona (; Latin: ) is the Roman goddess who protect parents who bereaved of their children and parents of ill children. The first mention of Orbona is unknown. She appears in the Arnobius Against The Heathen V4 written by Arnobius. Said Orbona is the goddess who takes care of parents who bereaved of their children. There is no description of the appearance or related presence in the Roman mythology. Orbona is a unique figure in Roman religion. She stands apart and does not derive directly from any Greek goddess. Her name is barely seen in the present because she has a particular role to protect only the father and mother who lose their child to death.

== Etymology ==
The name Orbona is from the latin from orbus (‚Äúbereft‚Äù) + -≈çna (‚Äúepithets of female deities‚Äù). The word orbus is from Proto-Indo-Eurupean *h‚ÇÉerb ∞- (‚Äúorphan‚Äù). Cognate with Ancient Greek ·ΩÄœÅœÜŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ (orphan√≥s, ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù). Meaning related to bereaved, bereft, deprived by death which refers to orphaned, parentless, fatherless, childless, widowed.

== Origins ==
The first mention of Orbona is unknown. She appear in the Arnobius Against The Heathen V4 written by Arnobius, a Christian apologist from the 4th century. Said Orbona is the goddess take care parents who bereaved of their children. There are interpretations from other writings that Orbona was a goddess invoked by father and mother, for the preservation of their children and those who has lose them were under particular protection of her. In other writings it has been interpreted that the offering were not intended for the soul of the decreased, but for the safety of remaining children or for the conception of additional ones. Also, parents of ill children prayed to Orbona too. In some writing, there is a mention of Orbona alongside deities like Febris, goddess of fever and Mala Fortuna, goddess of bad luck. Which indicates that she might have had a darker or more ominous aspect in Roman belief.

== Presence in mythology ==
Orbona is a sub deity in Roman mythology. Unlike other deities, her presence is absent in Roman mythology. She was more of a protective figure in rituals related to childbirth and mourning. Her role highlights the everyday realities of child loss in ancient Roman society, even if she doesn‚Äôt have extensive stories or myths attributed to her.

All mentioned in the writings about Orbona is in the same direction that her take a particular duty to protect the father and mother who bereaved of their children. The temple of Orbona is mentioned in the Natural History written by Pliny the Elder, a Roman author. Said its was located near the Temple of the Lares to relieve disease at that time. At present, the Temple of the Lares is part of the archaeological area of the Roman Forum.

== Modern Interpretations ==
The word ‚ÄúOrbona‚Äù appears in some modern media like ‚ÄúThe Search for WondLa‚Äù which is the name of the planet, or the HBO drama series ‚ÄúRome‚Äù tells the story of two soldiers named Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, who find their lives intertwined with key historical events. Even though her presence is barely seen in the present, her name still associated with Roman mythology.

In Tony DiTerlizzi&#x27;s children novel The Search for WondLa, Orbona is the name of the planet that serves as the setting for the story. The human girl, Eva Nine carries out a perilous search for others human, accompanied by a caretaker robot and two friendly denizens of the planet. This relates to the goddess Orbona from Roman myths because she is an orphan, though accompanied by a robot she calls Muthr who has raised her in the underground sanctuary, and she wanted to find others like her- like a parent who wants a child, or vice versa.

In the HBO drama series, Rome, the goddess is mentioned as the Blessed Orbona by Lyde after she joins the temple.

<text>The Great Renaming was a restructuring of Usenet newsgroups that took place in 1987. B News maintainer and UUNET founder Rick Adams is generally considered to be the initiator of the Renaming.

==Motivation==

The primary reason for the Great Renaming was said to be the difficulty of maintaining a list of all the existing groups.

An alternative explanation was that European networks refused to pay for some of the high-volume and low-content groups such as those regarding religion and racism; this resulted in a need for categorization of all such newsgroups.
The suggested category for the newsgroups less popular among European networks was &quot;talk.*&quot;

==History==

===Pre-renaming===
Before the Renaming, the newsgroups were categorized into three hierarchies: &quot;fa.*&quot; for groups gatewayed from ARPANET, &quot;mod.*&quot; for moderated discussions, and &quot;net.*&quot; for unmoderated groups. Names of the groups were said to be rather haphazard.

While reorganization discussions had occurred earlier, software limitations prevented the adoption of a consistent organizational scheme. Improvements introduced by Adams during 1986 with B News version 2.11 removed the requirement for moderated groups to use the &quot;mod.&quot; prefix, allowed posting to moderated groups using newsreaders rather than separate e-mail programs, and eliminated the flat storage method, which required that the first 14 characters of all newsgroups be unique. With this added flexibility and transparency, it became practical to perform the effort.

===Renaming===
The &quot;backbone providers&quot;, &quot;the backbone cabal&quot;, were instrumental in this reorganization of Usenet since they had great influence with respect to supporting a new newsgroup. Some suggest that members of the cabal had interests in bundling certain newsgroups into the &quot;talk.*&quot; hierarchy, so that they would not be objected to by their supervisors.

These newsgroups were categorized into a series of hierarchies, to make it easier for newsgroups to be created and distributed. The original hierarchies were &quot;comp.*&quot;, &quot;misc.*&quot;, &quot;news.*&quot;, &quot;rec.*&quot;, &quot;sci.*&quot;, &quot;soc.*&quot;, and &quot;talk.*&quot;.

These hierarchies, known collectively as the &quot;Big Seven&quot;, were open and free for anyone to participate in (except for the moderated newsgroups), though they were subject to a few general rules governing their naming and distribution.

Several other popular hierarchies remained on Usenet as well, such as the &quot;k12.*&quot; hierarchy, which covers topics especially relating to education, schools, and colleges.

===Post-renaming===

An additional hierarchy, &quot;alt.*&quot;, was also created soon after the Renaming. The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy was meant to be completely free from centralized control, and it was not subject to the formalities of the Big Seven.

The prefix &quot;alt&quot; designated a hierarchy that is &quot;alternative&quot; to the &quot;mainstream&quot; (comp, misc, news, rec, soc, sci, talk) hierarchies.
As free form discussion on alt.* contrasted with the more academic tending formal hierarchies, the &quot;So You Want to Create an Alt Newsgroup&quot; FAQ jokes that the name &quot;alt&quot; is an acronym for &quot;anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists&quot;, though this is actually just a humorous backronym.

In April 1995, when Usenet traffic grew significantly, particularly in academia, the &quot;humanities.*&quot; hierarchy was introduced to better cover the additional kinds of topics being discussed, and with the seven hierarchies created by the Renaming, compose today&#x27;s so-called &quot;Big 8&quot;.

<doc id="85546" wikidata="Q654604" url="?curid=85546" title="Pales">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Pales was a deity of shepherds, flocks and livestock. Regarded as male by some sources and female by others, &quot;Pales&quot; can be either singular or plural in Latin, and refers at least once to a pair of deities.

Pales&#x27; festival, called the Parilia, was celebrated on April 21. Cattle were driven through bonfires on this day. Pales and the Parilia were strictly connected to the foundation of Rome which took place on the day of their festival.

Marcus Atilius Regulus built a temple to Pales in Rome following his victory over the Salentini in 267 BC. It is generally thought to have been located on the Palatine Hill, but, being a victory monument, it may have been located on the route of the triumphal procession, either on the Campus Martius or the Aventine Hill. According to the &quot;Fasti Antiates Maiores&quot;, there was a festival for &quot;the two Pales&quot; (&quot;Palibus duobus&quot;) on July 7, probably to mark the dedication of this temple.

Scholarship has suggested the Pales deities are related to Sicilian pair of gods Palici, and both sets of brother may be reflexes of the Indo-European mytheme of the Divine twins.

Pales appears in pastoral plays of the 16th and 17th centuries, commonly depicted as an assistant to Pan.

<text>Harran is a municipality and district of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, Turkey. Its area is 904¬†km2, and its population is 96,072 (2022). It is approximately southeast of Urfa and from the Syrian border crossing at Ak√ßakale.

Harran was founded at some point between the 25th and 20th centuries BC, possibly as a merchant colony by Sumerian traders from Ur. Over the course of its early history, Harran rapidly grew into a major Mesopotamian cultural, commercial and religious center. It was made a religiously and politically influential city through its association with the moon-god Sin; many prominent Mesopotamian rulers consulted with and renovated the moon-temple of Ekhulkhul in Harran. Harran came under Assyrian rule under Adad-nirari¬†I (¬†BC) and became a provincial capital often second in importance only to the Assyrian capital of Assur itself. During the collapse of the Assyrian Empire, Harran briefly served as the final capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (612‚Äì609¬†BC).

The city continued to be prominent after the fall of Assyria and experienced varying degrees of foreign cultural influence during its time under the Neo-Babylonian (609‚Äì539¬†BC), Achaemenid (539‚Äì330¬†BC), Macedonian (330‚Äì312¬†BC) and Seleucid (312‚Äì132¬†BC) empires. During classical antiquity Harran was often contested between the Roman and Parthian (later Sasanian) empires. In 53¬†BC Harran was the site of the Battle of Carrhae, one of the worst military defeats in Roman history. The Harranian moon cult of Sin proved to be enduring and lasted long into the Middle Ages, known to have existed as late as the 11th century AD. Harran was captured by the Rashidun Caliphate in 640 and remained an important city in the Islamic period. It flourished as a center of science and learning and was the site of both the first Islamic university (the Harran University) and the oldest mosque in Anatolia (the ). Harran twice served as a capital city in the Middle Ages, first briefly under the Umayyad Caliphate (744‚Äì750) and later under the Numayrid Emirate (990‚Äì1081).

The city was conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1260 but was largely destroyed and left abandoned in 1271. Although Harran was kept as a military outpost under some later regimes, it has over the last five centuries mainly been used as a temporary settlement by local nomadic societies. Harran transitioned back into a semi-permanent village settlement in the 1840s, but has only recently grown into a permanent town through advancements in local irrigation and agriculture. Harran was a Turkish district until 1946, after when it was downgraded to a sub-district of the Ak√ßakale district. It regained its status as a district in 1987. Today, it is a major local tourist spot. The town is particularly famous for its unique beehive houses, which are reminiscent of buildings that were already present at Harran in ancient Mesopotamian times.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Harran&quot; is recorded for the city from the earliest documents mentioning it and has remained in continuous use and largely unchanged since ancient times. Harran is mentioned in early cuneiform records of the Sumerians and Hittites as íå∑íäÆíÜú (), sometimes shortened to íÜú (), transliterated as &quot;·∏™arrƒÅnu&quot;(&quot;m&quot;). &quot;·∏™arrƒÅnu&quot; literally means &quot;journey&quot;, &quot;caravan&quot; or &quot;crossroad&quot;. It is often interpreted as &quot;caravan path&quot; or &quot;intersection of routes and travel&quot;. Harran is rendered as l (&quot;·∏§aran&quot;) in Hebrew and Aramaic, ÿ≠Ÿéÿ±ŸéŸëÿßŸÜ (&quot;·∏§arr√¢n&quot;) in Arabic, ÿ≠ÿ±ÿßŸÜ (&quot;HarrƒÅn&quot;) in Ottoman Turkish, and &quot;Harran&quot; in modern Turkish.

The ancient Assyrians called the city &quot;Huzirina&quot;. &quot;·∏™arrƒÅnu&quot; was Hellenised to &quot;K√°rrhai&quot; () in the Hellenistic period. The Romans later Latinised the Greek name into &quot;Carrhae&quot;. Due to the prominence of both Harran and Carrhae in historical literary sources, some scholars use the compound name &quot;Carrhae-Harran&quot; for the ancient city. Under the Byzantine Empire, the city continued to be called &quot;Carrhae&quot; () but was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Hellenopolis&quot; (), &quot;city of the pagan Greeks&quot;, in reference to the strong pagan traditions there.

== History ==
=== Ancient Near East (2500‚Äì539 BC) ===

==== Early history ====

Harran is situated at an important geographical crossroad, both between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and at the border between the ancient Mesopotamian and Anatolian cultures. The earliest known settlements in the region surrounding Harran date to 10000‚Äì8000 BC and settlements in its close vicinity are known to have existed by 6000¬†BC. The region was linked to the Sumerians, and was occupied by ancient Semitic-speaking people around 2750¬†BC. The earliest written records concerning Harran suggest that the city itself was founded 2500‚Äì2000 BC as a merchant outpost by traders from the Sumerian city of Ur.

Harran was from early on associated with the Mesopotamian moon-god Nanna (later known as Sin) and soon became regarded as a sacred city of the moon. The Ekhulkhul (&quot;Temple of Rejoicing&quot;), Harran&#x27;s great moon temple, was already present in the city by 2000¬†BC. Sin was a major deity in Ur, which also housed his main temple, but Harran&#x27;s devotion to the moon can perhaps also be explained by its geography and climate. According to Donald Frew, the sun was a natural enemy in the hot and desolate landscape surrounding Harran whereas the night (and thus the moon) were more comforting. The sun-god Shamash is however also thought to have had a temple in Harran. Another prominent deity in the city was Sin&#x27;s son Nusku, the god of light.

Although next to nothing is known of the architecture and layout of Harran prior to the Middle Ages, the city is believed to have been designed according to a vaguely moon-shaped plan since Medieval sources allude to this. What kind of moon shape is meant by the sources is not clear.

The religious authorities of Harran, speaking on behalf of Sin, were considered suitable guarantors and signatories in political treaties.

The first clear evidence about Harran comes from the inscribed clay tablets found at Ebla, dating to the 24th century BC. These tablets provide good information about the social and administrative life of Harran during the Early Bronze Age. Harran is mentioned in the Ebla tablets together with the cities of Urshun and Irrite. At that time, Harran was ruled by a queen named Zugalum.

Already 2000¬†BC, a peace treaty was sealed in the Ekhulkhul between Mari and the Yaminites, an Amorite tribe. Further treaties signed that invoke Sin of Harran include a 14th-century¬†BC treaty between ≈†uppiluliuma I of the Hittites and Shattiwaza of Mitanni, and an 8th-century BC treaty between the Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V and Mati&#x27;ilu of Arpad.

Harran grew into a major Mesopotamian cultural, commercial and religious center. In addition to its religious importance, Harran was also important due to its strategic placement on an intersection of trade routes. Because Harran had an abundance of goods that passed through its region, it often became a target for raids. In the 19th century BC, the lands surrounding Harran were occupied by confederations of semi-nomadic tribes. In the following century the Amorite king Shamshi-Adad¬†I (¬†BC) is recorded to have launched an expedition to conquer the region around Harran and secure the trade routes there from hostile forces. After the fall of Shamshi-Adad I&#x27;s kingdom in the early 18th century BC, Harran was an independent city-state for a time; archives from Mari from the time of Zimri-Lim () record that Harran in his time was ruled by a king named Asdi-Takim. Harran was later incorporated into the Mitanni kingdom in the 16th century BC.

==== Assyria and Babylonia ====

Harran was conquered from Mitanni by the Assyrian king Adad-nirari¬†I (¬†BC). The city would not be firmly incorporated into Middle Assyrian Empire until the 1100s BC, before which it was often occupied by Arameans. Under Assyria, Harran grew into a fortified provincial capital second in importance only to the capital of Assur itself. In the 10th century, Harran was one of the few cities, along with Assur, to be exempt from needing to pay tribute to the Assyrian king and in the 9th and 8th centuries BC, Harran was made the seat of the &quot;turtanu&quot;, the Assyrian commander-in-chief.

Since Harran was the sacred city of the moon-god, many Mesopotamian kings travelled there to receive the blessing and confirmation of their rule from the city&#x27;s religious officials and in turn renovated and expanded Harran and its temples. The Ekhulkhul was renovated twice in the Neo-Assyrian period by the kings Shalmaneser III ( BC) and Ashurbanipal (¬†BC). Prophecies made by prophets and oracles of the moon cult of Harran were held in high regard; in the 670s BC the Harranians correctly prophesied that Esarhaddon (¬†BC) would conquer Egypt and Sasi, a usurper proclaimed king by the Oracle of Nusku from Harran, managed to rally widespread support in the empire before he was defeated. The reign of Esarhaddon in particular marked the rise of the Ekhulkhul into one of the most prominent religious sanctuaries in the ancient Near East, a position it would retain for centuries.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire was defeated in the late seventh century BC by the newly established Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Medes. The Assyrian capital of Nineveh fell in 612¬†BC but the remnants of the Assyrian army, led by Crown Prince A≈°≈°ur-uballi·π≠ II, rallied at Harran. Harran is therefore typically regarded as the short-lived final capital of ancient Assyria. A≈°≈°ur-uballi·π≠ II underwent a coronation ceremony at Harran, being invested with rulership by Sin. After a long siege lasting from the winter of 610 BC to early 609¬†BC, Harran was captured by the Babylonians and Medes, ending the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Ekhulkhul was destroyed by the Medes at this time and was neglected for many years but was eventually restored by the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus ( BC), who was from Harran. The city itself was also significantly revitalised in Nabonidus&#x27;s reign.

=== Antiquity (539 BC‚Äì640) ===

After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, Harran was successively under the control of the Achaemenid (539‚Äì330¬†BC), Macedonian (330‚Äì312¬†BC) and Seleucid (312‚Äì132¬†BC) empires. Under the Seleucids, Harran largely functioned as a military colony and from the time of the Macedonian conquest onwards, many Greeks settled in Harran. Under the centuries of Hellenic control, Harran gradually underwent some Hellenization of its culture. After the collapse of the Seleucid Empire, Harran became part of the Kingdom of Osroene in 132¬†BC, ruled by the Nabatean Arab Abgarid dynasty and most frequently a vassal state of the Parthian Empire. Abgarid rule may have encouraged the local moon cult; the moon was important in both the ancient Bedouin and Nabatean Arab religions.

From the first century BC until the end of antiquity, Harran was typically located near or on the border of the Roman (later Byzantine) and Parthian (later Sasanian) empires. Harran frequently changed hands between the two empires but was in practice often more or less independent. In 53¬†BC, the city was the site of the Battle of Carrhae between the Romans and Parthians, in which the Parthian general Surena defeated and killed the Roman triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of the worst military defeats in Roman history. Osroene (and thus also Harran) first came under Roman control as a result of the wars of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius in 162‚Äì166¬†AD. Harran gained colonial status under Emperor Septimius Severus in 195. Sources from Roman times describe Harran as a fortified garrison town. In 217, the Roman emperor Caracalla was murdered in Harran while visiting the temple of Sin. Harran, along with the nearby cities of Nisibis and Hatra, were captured by the Sasanian king Ardashir¬†I in 238‚Äì240 but was swiftly retaken by Emperor Gordian III. Later in 296, Harran was also the site of a battle where the future emperor Galerius suffered a crushing defeat against the Sasanian king Narseh. In the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus (359), it is noted that the walls of Harran were in poor condition. This issue was not rectified until repairs conducted in the reign of Justinian¬†I ().

From the time of the Christianization of Mesopotamia and Syria until long into the Middle Ages, Harran developed a rivalry with the nearby city of Edessa due to the cities having polarised attitudes concerning Christianity. Whereas Edessa adopted the new religion very early, Harran remained a pagan stronghold for centuries and became the largest center of pagan cults in eastern Syria. Harran was still overwhelmingly pagan in the 4th century, to the degree that the bishop appointed to Harran in 361 refused to reside in the city and instead lived in Edessa. Despite its paganism, Harran was a site of interest to Christians since the city is mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the town where Abraham and his family stopped on their way from Ur of the Chaldees to Canaan.

The last pagan Roman emperor, Julian () intentionally avoided the Christian Edessa and instead stopped at Harran in 363 to consult the oracles of the moon temple on his upcoming Persian campaign. Although it is known that Sin was still worshipped at Harran in this time Julian is curiously stated to have consulted the female moon deity Luna. The oracles warned the emperor of impending disaster but Julian proceeded anyway and was killed in the war. Harran was the only city in the Roman Empire to declare citywide mourning after Julian&#x27;s death. Later sources indicate that the deities worshipped by the pagans of Harran in late antiquity included Sin, Bat-Nikkal (consort of Sin; a different name from his ancient consort Ningal), the &quot;lord with his dogs&quot; (identified as a localised version of the god Nergal), Tar&#x27;atha (identified with the Syrian goddess Atargatis), Gadlat (an Arabian goddess), and perhaps Shamash. Though Sin had in the past been the only major deity in Harran, he was by this point only the most important of several different ancient gods.

The pagans of Harran became an issue in the increasingly Christianised late Roman Empire. As late as the early 5th century, the theologian Theodoret wrote that Harran was &quot;a barbarous place, full of the thorns of paganism&quot;. At the Second Council of Ephesus (449), the Bishop of Harran, Stephen, was accused of accepting bribes from pagans to let them practice their rituals in peace. Harran was briefly captured by the Sasanian king Khosrow I in 549, who exempted the city from paying the tribute he demanded from Edessa on account of Harran not being Christian like his enemies but rather a stronghold of the &quot;old religion&quot;. The endurance of paganism at Harran in the Christian late Roman Empire is likely only explainable through the pagans there offering regular bribes to church officials and civil administrators in the region. In 590, Emperor Maurice () ordered the Bishop of Harran, Stephen, to persecute the pagans of Harran. Many who refused to convert to Christianity, including the governor Acindynus, were executed. By this time, the Christians and pagans of Harran lived in separate quarters of the city.

=== Middle Ages (640‚Äì1271) ===

==== Harran under the caliphates ====

Maurice&#x27;s persecution of the pagans of Harran had little effect on the strength of the pagan community and Harran remained a largely pagan city. When the armies of the Rashidun Caliphate, led by the general Iyad ibn Ghanm, besieged Harran in the winter of 639‚Äì640 it was the pagans of the city who negotiated its peaceful surrender. Ibn Ghanm is recorded to have given the pagans of Harran a new moon temple after the capture of the city. Harran under Islamic rule became one of the most important settlements in the Diyar Mudar district. In 657, Caliph Ali asked the Harranians to aid him against Mu&#x27;awiya I, the first Umayyad caliph, but the Harranians instead sided with Mu&#x27;awiya at the Battle of Siffin in the same year. In response, it is said that Ali enacted a brutal massacre in Harran, exterminating most of the inhabitants.

Under the Umayyad Caliphate (661‚Äì750), Harran was renovated and prospered once more. In 717, Caliph Umar II founded the first Muslim university at Harran, bringing many scholars from other cities in the caliphate (including Alexandria) and installing them in Harran. Harran was made the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate under its last caliph, Marwan II, from 744 to 750. The reason for Marwan moving his court to Harran is not known, but might be either to better monitor the troublesome eastern provinces of the caliphate or due to the anti-Christian sentiment of the city&#x27;s pagan population, who had never been disloyal to the Umayyads. The move of the capital to Harran caused some outrage; the Banu Kalb tribe saw it as an abandonment of Syria and under Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri besieged the former capital of Damascus before being suppressed. Harran did not continue to function as a capital under the succeeding Abbasid Caliphate, though the city enjoyed some special privileges. When Al-Mansur () ordered the destruction of the walls of all cities in northern Mesopotamia, Harran was a notable exception.

The Harran University underwent its golden age in the 8th century, particularly under the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (). Many prominent scholars of this time were educated at the university in subjects such as mathematics, philosophy, medicine and astrology. The university was also an important site for translations of documents from Syriac and Greek into Arabic and Harran flourished as a center of science and learning. Al-Rashid furthermore supplied Harran with a new water supply, constructing a canal from the Balikh River. At some point, Neoplatonism was introduced to Harranian intellectuals, though the precise timing is not clear. It might have been brought to Harran by the scholar ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra in the late 9th century, who could have learnt Neoplatonism in Baghdad. Alternatively, Neoplatonism might have been brought to Harran as early as the 6th century by Neoplatonists such as Simplicius of Cilicia, who fled persecution in the Byzantine Empire.

The local Harranian religion continued to develop as a blend of ancient Mesopotamian religion and Neoplatonism and Harran remained notorious for its strong pagan traditions long into the Islamic period. The city retained a highly heterogenous population that practiced many different religions. Some adopted syncretistic faiths tolerable by the Muslims, others continued to honor the old deities of ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, and some primarily worshipped the stars and planets. The Harranian pagans considered themselves the heirs of ancient star-worshipping civilizations such as Babylonia, Greece, India, Persia and Egypt. In addition to pagans, Harran was also home to Muslims, Christians, Jews, Samaritans, Zoroastrians, Manicheans, and other groups.

In 830, Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s son Al-Ma&#x27;mun () arrived at Harran with an army on his way to raid in the Byzantine Empire and intended to destroy the city due to its large pagan population. Al-Ma&#x27;mun asked the populace if they were Muslims, Christians or Jews (&quot;people of the book&quot; protected under Islamic law). Unable to claim that they were, the people of Harran instead claimed that they were &quot;Sabians&quot;, a mysterious religious group also protected according to the Quran but who no one at the time knew who they were. Upon being inquired who their prophet was, the Harranians claimed that their prophet was the legendary Hellenistic figure Hermes Trismegistus. There were many Islamic writers who saw through the claims of Harranians and still considered them to be pagans and not Sabians, and thus lacking any special right to toleration or protection. In 933, the Harranian pagans were ordered through a decree to convert to Islam, but a visitor to the city in the following year found that there were still pagan religious leaders operating a remaining public temple. Toleration of the pagans at Harran appears to have been renewed in the late 10th century.

==== Late Middle Ages ====

The power of the Abbasid Caliphate and its vassals in the region around Harran (the Hamdanid dynasty) declined at the end of the 10th century. A new local Arab dynasty emerged during this time, the Numayrid dynasty, who ruled a small realm with Harran as its capital from 990 to 1081. The toleration of paganism at Harran was at last revoked for the final time in the 11th century and the last moon temples were closed and destroyed. The precise date when this happened and the events surrounding it are unknown, perhaps coinciding with the city falling under the control of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1038 through the submission of the Numayrid ruler Shabƒ´b ibn WaththƒÅb, or more likely with a failed anti-Uqaylid rebellion in 1083. Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad reported that a Sabian temple was destroyed by the Uqaylid dynasty governor Yahya ibn as-Shatir, who conquered Harran in 1081. In 1059, the Harran Castle, presumably constructed in Byzantine times, was rebuilt and strengthened by the Numayrid ruler Manƒ´ ø ibn Shabƒ´b. By the 1180s, Harran was fully devoted to Islam with little to no traces of its former moon cult.

In the late 11th and early 12th century, political control in northern Mesopotamia and Syria was fragmented. Harran was an important city to the various local Muslim rulers as a counterweight to the nearby crusader states. Numayrid control of Harran came to an end in 1081 when the city was captured by the Uqaylid dynasty. It was then under the control of various Turkish princes; first Jikirmish of Mosul (1102‚Äì1106), then the Artuqids of Mardin (1106‚Äì1127) and then the Zengid dynasty, which captured Harran under Imad al-Din Zengi in 1127.

In the 12th century, Harran at times fell under the influence of the County of Edessa, a short-lived crusader state. There is no record of the crusaders ever conquering Harran but the Harran Castle preserves remnants of a Christian chapel with distinct crusader architecture, perhaps suggesting a peaceful crusader presence. The growth of Edessa under Christian rule contributed to the decline of Harran. Edessa is higher up the water table than Harran and as more wells were constructed in Edessa, those in Harran gradually dried up. Harran was in the 12th century still renowned for its ancient origins; a now lost work by Hammad al-Harrani made the claim that Harran had been the first city founded after the great flood.

Despite the threat of water scarcity, Harran continued to be an important town under the rule of the Ayyubid Sultanate, which followed the Zengids. Saladin () at some point enlarged Harran&#x27;s and thereafter granted Harran to his brother Al-Adil I (later sultan 1200‚Äì1218). Al-Adil later gave Harran to his son Al-Kamil (later sultan 1218‚Äì1238). Harran was then under the rule of Al-Kamil&#x27;s brother Al-Ashraf Musa 1202‚Äì1228/1229, after whose death the city steadily declined in importance. Harran was captured by Khwarazmians in 1237, driven from their homeland following the fall of the Khwarazmian Empire, but the castle was retained and fortified by the Ayyubid ruler As-Salih Ayyub though he soon had to give it up to broker a deal with the Khwarazmians for military aid against Badr al-Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; of Mosul. Harran was later regained from the Khwarazmians by the Ayyubids in 1240 by An-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo.

Harran was captured by the Mongol Empire under Hulagu Khan in 1259 or 1260 through the peaceful surrender of its governor. The Harran Castle, as was traditional placed under a different governor, continued to resist for some time until one of the towers were breached. Under the Mongols, Harran continued to flourish for a few years as a major urban center. Mongol control of Harran was immediately contested by the Sultanate of Rum and the Mamluk Sultanate. The Mongols decided to abandon Harran in 1271, deporting the population to the nearby cities of Mardin and Mosul. Accounts differ concerning the reason for the abandonment and the state in which the city was left. One account states that the city had been damaged in a battle against the Turks in the year prior, motivating the abandonment, whereas another states that the Mongols themselves caused the damage during the abandonment. The Mongols are also variously stated to either have simply walled up the gates but otherwise left what remained intact or to have pillaged the city for building materials before burning down the remnants. One major reason for the abandonment was likely the decreasing water supply. It was impossible to sustain the population size of Harran with its water storage systems in disrepair and its wells no longer producing enough water. Another possible reason for the abandonment was the difficulty to retain and defend Harran and the little strategic value offered by the city in return.

=== Later history (1271‚Äìpresent) ===

Harran was regained from the Mongols by the Mamluk Sultanate later in the 1270s. The Mamluks repaired the castle at some point, most likely in the 1330s or 1340s, and it became the seat of a local military governor, but there was otherwise little effort spent on trying to revive the city. By this point Harran was no longer on any of the major trade routes. A small village-sized settlement sprung up at the site, probably in the immediate vicinity of the castle. The space within Harran&#x27;s city walls gradually filled up with dirt and sand through natural means. Over the centuries, few structures remained above the soil; the castle survived owing to its position on a hill and its continued usage. The remnants of the mosque were also kept clear due to its religious and historical significance.

Under the Ottoman Empire, which captured the region in the early 16th century, Harran was the capital of a nahiyah (a local administrative unit composed of a group of villages). The demolished Harran University was repaired under the Ottoman sultan Selim I () though it again declined in importance after his reign. The Ottomans continued to use the castle, and also built a new smaller mosque in the southern part of the city, but Harran gradually declined over the course of Ottoman rule and was eventually entirely abandoned as a permanent settlement.

Harran has over the last five hundred years mainly been used as a temporary settlement by local nomadic societies. One of the major semi-nomadic tribes that have continuously lived in and around Harran since the Middle Ages and still today are the &quot;Nmƒìr&quot;, descendants of the medieval Numayrid lords of the city. By the 1840s, Harran had once more become a semi-permanent village settlement, although the inhabitants spent the summer months encamped outside the village to avoid vermin in their houses. By the middle of the 20th century, Harran comprised about a hundred houses, inhabited by semi-settled nomadic Arabs, most of whom still did not stay at the site for the duration of the entire year. The city&#x27;s ancient water systems had long fallen into disrepair and Harran in the 20th century had only a single source of drinking water, Jacob&#x27;s Well, about west of its walls. Although six wells were still operational within the ancient walls they only produced brackish water and were thus only useful for providing water to animals. The water at Harran had perhaps been contaminated from seeping saltpeter from its ancient ruins.

Since the middle of the 20th century, Harran has re-transitioned into a permanently inhabited settlement due to local advancements in irrigation and agriculture. Particularly important in this development was the Turkish Southeastern Anatolia Project, launched in the 1970s, which through irrigation efforts transformed the formerly dry desert plains surrounding Harran into productive agricultural fields. Harran received its own plan for future development in 1992. The ruins of the ancient city were placed on the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey in 2000. Accelerated economic and demographic growth in Harran is expected to in the future once more transform Harran into an important local center. Economic issues caused by the Syrian civil war across the nearby Syrian border has recently caused many Harranian families to migrate elsewhere for work, such as to the cities Urfa (ancient Edessa), Adƒ±yaman and Gaziantep.

== Town ==

=== Monuments and ruins ===

The Harran Castle is a large brick fortress of unknown date, though ancient Greek inscriptions found at one of its gates suggest that it was founded at some point during Byzantine rule (4th‚Äì7th centuries). It is also possible that it was built under Muslim rule in the 9th century. If it was not built in the 9th century, it is likely to at least have been expanded in the early Islamic period. Before its fall into ruin, the castle was a three-story structure. It was probably initially a palace but was converted into a more castle-like militaristic building in the 11‚Äì13th centuries when the region surrounding Harran experienced considerable political turmoil. The castle has recently been partially excavated and reconstructed with the support of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
Harran was the site of the oldest mosque built in Anatolia, known as the Grand Mosque or Paradise Mosque. The mosque was built by the Umayyad caliph Marwan II in 744‚Äì750, at the time the city was his capital. The masonry of the mosque indicates that it was restored several times throughout its history. Measuring at its height, the mosque has fallen into ruin over the centuries and little of it remains standing today. Remaining portions include the eastern wall, the mihrab, a fountain, and the tall minaret.

Another important historical monument in Harran is its ancient burial mound, spread over a large area and partially surviving intact at the center of the city&#x27;s archaeological site. The burial mound preserves inscriptions and architectural elements from several different cultures and appears to have been in continuous use from the 3rd century BC to the 13th century AD. The burial mound may be older than Harran itself since ceramic dated to 5000 BC has been found at the site.

The precise location of the ancient great Ekhulkhul temple is unknown and no certain archaeological evidence of it has yet been found. It is likely that one of the major medieval buildings of Harran displaced the Elkhulkhul and were constructed on top of it, either the Harran Castle or the Grand Mosque. Writings from the Islamic period contradictingly claim that the castle or the mosque were the converted moon temple. The castle being on the site of the ancient temple is further supported by its higher elevation whereas the mosque is further supported by the finds of Babylonian inscriptions and four stelae of Nabonidus among its ruins. These inscriptions and stelae directly mention the Elkhulkhul. Additionally, the remains of an ancient altar with moon iconography have also been recovered from the ruins of the mosque. As a result, the mosque enjoys more scholarly support as the most likely site of the ancient temple.

=== City walls ===
The old town of Harran is still largely surrounded by Harran&#x27;s ancient city walls. Though they are in generally poor condition, some stretches are well-preserved in good condition and give an idea of how the settlement once looked. The exact date of the current walls and which of the many cultures that have inhabited Harran constructed them is not known. The walls were most likely constructed under either Roman or Byzantine rule. Inscriptions in both Greek and Syriac have been discovered during excavations of parts of the walls.

The walls of Harran resemble those of the nearby Edessa, though are slightly smaller. They are vaguely elliptical in layout, normally around thick and approximately long and high. Before they fell into ruin, the walls had 187 bastions and 6‚Äì8 gates, most of which are in ruined condition today. Only one of the medieval gates of Harran, the Aleppo Gate, remain standing today. The walls were once surrounded by a great moat filled with water.

=== Beehive houses ===
Harran mainly attracts attention today due to the distinctive vernacular architecture of the houses in its old town, known as beehive houses (&quot;k√ºmbets&quot;). This building type is not seen elsewhere in Turkey and is rare in the rest of the world. Houses similar to the modern beehive houses have long been present in Harran; the earliest known buildings from Harran appear to have been circular and Assyrian reliefs from the 7th century BC depict domed buildings architecturally similar to the present beehive houses. They have not been consistently present on the site, instead being built, ruined, forgotten and rebuilt multiple times throughout Harran&#x27;s history. Beehive houses were recorded at Harran by the 12th-century explorer Ibn Jubayr but not by the 17th-century explorer Evliya √áelebi.
The majority of the present beehive houses in Harran date to the early twentieth century and none have been standing for longer than since the mid-19th century. The architecture of the beehive houses has subtly changed since the twentieth century; photographs from that time show the houses erected on the grounds like tents whereas the present conical domes are built on larger cubical bases.

Since wood is rare in the region around Harran owing to its climate, locals have traditionally built houses from materials they could easily gather such as stone, brick and mud. The modern beehive houses were constructed by locals who learnt how to build them by examining excavated ancient buildings and used bricks gathered from the ruins as building material. The beehive houses were compatible with the nomadic lifestyle of the locals since they can be built and dismantled rapidly, like a tent, but also efficiently resist both heat and cold. Because of the weak materials used for plastering the beehive houses require repair every 1‚Äì3 years. Their walls are usually 50‚Äì60 centimetres thick and their domes are about 20‚Äì30 centimetres thick. The domes have an opening at the top which provides natural air circulation and ventilation. This feature, combined with the thick walls, provide relatively good indoor conditions throughout the year, even in the extreme summer heat.

As of a count conducted in 2002, Harran had 2,760 beehive houses though the number in the old town has since declined to a few dozen. Some of the beehive houses remained inhabited until the 1980s but they are today mainly used as store houses and barns and have been under conservation since 1979. One of the oldest extant buildings in Harran is a beehive complex that today serves as the Harran Culture House (&quot;Harran K√ºlt√ºr Evi&quot;), a local museum and restaurant. The Culture House building was originally built 1800 but fell into ruins at some point and was rebuilt for tourism purposes in 1999. The museum showcases artefacts as well as traditional jewelry and clothes from the region surrounding Harran.

=== Modern buildings ===
Since prohibitions relating to conservation of historical monuments has hindered locals from gathering building materials from the ancient ruins since the 1950s, newer houses constructed in Harran are mostly concrete structures with no architectural relation to the beehive houses. Concrete houses have been built both alongside beehive houses and outside the ancient city walls. The majority of the population of Harran today live in a more newly constructed village about from the old city center.

== Geography and climate ==
Harran is located in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey, approximately southeast of Urfa. Harran is situated above sea level, which is the lowest point in the surrounding lowland region.

Harran has a hot and dry climate. The precipitation rate is rarely more than 40 centimetres. During the summer, Harran experiences significant temperature differences between the days and nights.

== Demographics ==

In its most prosperous periods in ancient and medieval history Harran was probably home to around 10,000‚Äì20,000 residents.

As a result of Harran&#x27;s retransition into a permanent settlement over the course of the late 20th century and early 21st century, the city and surrounding district has experienced a rapid population increase. Despite this, Harran retains predominantly rural characteristics. As of 2022, Harran had a population of 96,072. The Harran district ranks 857th among 872 districts in Turkey, and last among the districts of the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, by socioeconomic development. As of 2009, Harran has a low unemployment rate (2.73%; 753rd among all districts), a low literacy rate (55.16%; 865th among all districts) and a high population increase rate (64.23%; 7th among all districts). Harran&#x27;s possibilities for development are subject to several limiting factors, including the amount of productive land and the relatively limited area reserved for urban development.

In his seyahatn√¢me from the 17th century, Evliya √áelebi mentioned that the vicinity of Harran was inhabited by Bedouins of Qays and Mawali tribes. The local culture is predominantly Arabic in terms of lifestyle, clothing and food. Harran has close social, cultural, commercial and urban relations with Urfa, the capital of the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province. The majority of the district&#x27;s population is composed of tribal Arabs.
===Language===
According to the census conducted by Turkey in 1927, 88.0% of the population spoke Arabic as their mother tongue; 6.8% Kurdish, and 5.2% Turkish. In 1998, the majority of the population of Harran spoke Turkish; approximately 19% spoke Arabic and 10% spoke Kurdish.

== Tourism ==
The ancient ruins at Harran function like an open-air museum and the town is a popular local tourist attraction, often visited as a day trip from Urfa. Popular attractions include the Harran Culture House and the ruins of the castle and mosque. Prior to 2015, Harran had around two million visitors a year, according to a local tour guide. The Syrian civil war has reduced this to almost zero.

== Politics ==

Harran was established as a district in 1987 and divided into three neighbourhoods. Harran first participated in the Turkish local elections in 1989, though there were no mayoral candidates at that time. The 1989 election was a close election between three parties; the True Path Party (DYP) received 36.1% of the vote, the ANAP received 35.8% and the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP) received 28.1%.

ƒ∞brahim √ñzyavuz of the AK Party and later the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) served as Mayor of Harran for three terms from 1994 to 2009, achieving victory in the local elections of 1994, 1999 and 2004. ƒ∞brahim √ñzyavuz was defeated in the local elections of March 2009, beaten by Mehmet √ñzyavuz of AK Party who achieved 54.2% of the vote. Mehmet √ñzyavuz retained his position as mayor for a second term winning the local elections of March 2014, receiving 55.5% of the vote.

Since 31 March 2019, the Mayor of Harran is Mahmut √ñzyavuz of the MHP, who won in the local elections of March 2019 with 54.9% of the vote, defeating the incumbent Mehmet √ñzyavuz of the AK Party. Mahmut √ñzyavuz is the son of ƒ∞brahim √ñzyavuz.

== Archaeology ==

Although Harran was of great interest to historians due to its association with the ancient moon cult and its abundant appearances in Mesopotamian, Roman and Arab historical writings, the site itself did not receive significant archaeological attention until the 19th century owing to its geographical remoteness. Harran first garnered attention in 1850 when it was visited by some members of Francis Rawdon Chesney&#x27;s Euphrates Expedition. Harran was also visited by the missionary George Percy Badger in 1852 and by Eduard Sachau in 1879, who sketched some of the ruins. In 1911, Conrad Preusser published a brief but accurate study of the ruins of the Harran Castle and K. A. C. Creswell included a detailed survey of the remains of the Grand Mosque in his 1932 book &quot;Early Muslim Architecture&quot; Volume I. Harran was also visited and photographed by T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;). None of these early visitors conducted excavations and instead only observed the ruins and remnants visible on the surface.

Seton Lloyd, William C. Brice and C. J. Gadd led a three-week archaeological expedition at Harran in the summer of 1950. Results from a further archaeological survey conducted by R. Storm Rice were also published in 1952. Lloyd, Brice, Gadd and Rice mainly confined themselves to surveying Harran and clearing rubble. Rice&#x27;s work did however reveal the extent of the original city walls and their gates. During later digs in 1956 and 1959, Rice also excavated the ruins of the Grand Mosque. The site was later visited by H.J.W. Drijvers (who authored &quot;Cults and Beliefs at Edessa&quot;) in the 1970s and by Tamara Green (who authored &quot;The City of the Moon God&quot;) in 1977, but both only observed previously reported discoveries and did not dig for any new material. Excavations at Harran have thus continued to be very limited, partly due to its remote and at times politically tumultuous location and partly due to the difficulty for foreign archaeologists to work in Turkey.

In 2012 and 2013, the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Museum Directorate, with Mehmet √ñnal acting as consultant, carried out more extensive excavations at Harran, focusing on the walls, burial mound and castle. The excavations were mainly for restoration purposes on the western part of the city wall and uncovered the walls, towers and bastions. In excavations in the northern part of the castle, a gallery and crenellated corridor were discovered on the west side, with several artefacts of interest. In 2014, following a decision of the Council of Ministers and courtesy of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, further excavation work was conducted, again under the direction of √ñnal. This round of excavations uncovered a bathhouse, a bazaar, public toilets, a perfumery shop and workshop. In 2016, further excavations were carried out on the city wall, revealing new parts of the wall and leading to the discovery of a broken statue of a woman with a Syriac inscription and a male relief, both used as spolia in the wall. Excavations of the west side of the castle carried out in 2014‚Äì2016 uncovered a crenellated corridor belonging to a second defense system adjacent to the wall of the castle and further excavations in 2017‚Äì2018 in the southern part of the castle located remnants of a bathhouse.

<text>Sin () or Suen (, ) also known as Nanna ( ) is the Mesopotamian god representing the moon. While these two names originate in two different languages, respectively Akkadian and Sumerian, they were already used interchangeably to refer to one deity in the Early Dynastic period. They were sometimes combined into the double name Nanna-Suen. A third well attested name is Dilimbabbar (). Additionally, the name of the moon god could be represented by logograms reflecting his lunar character, such as d30 (), referring to days in the lunar month or dU4.SAKAR (), derived from a term referring to the crescent. In addition to his astral role, Sin was also closely associated with cattle herding. Furthermore, there is some evidence that he could serve as a judge of the dead in the underworld. A distinct tradition in which he was regarded either as a god of equal status as the usual heads of the Mesopotamian pantheon, Enlil and Anu, or as a king of the gods in his own right, is also attested, though it only had limited recognition. In Mesopotamian art, his symbol was the crescent. When depicted anthropomorphically, he typically either wore headwear decorated with it or held a staff topped with it, though on &quot;kudurru&quot; the crescent alone serves as a representation of him. He was also associated with boats.

The goddess Ningal was regarded as Sin&#x27;s wife. Their best attested children are Inanna (Ishtar) and Utu (Shamash), though other deities, for example Ningublaga or Numushda, could be regarded as members of their family too. Sin was also believed to have an attendant deity (sukkal), Alammu≈°, and various courtiers, such as Nineigara, Ninurima and Nimintabba. He was also associated with other lunar gods, such as Hurrian Ku≈°u·∏´ or Ugaritic Yarikh.

The main cult center of Sin was Ur. He was already associated with this city in the Early Dynastic period, and was recognized as its tutelary deity and divine ruler. His temple located there was known under the ceremonial name Eki≈°nugal, and through its history it was rebuilt by multiple Mesopotamian rulers. Ur was also the residence of the &quot;en&quot; priestesses of Nanna, the most famous of whom was Enheduanna. Furthermore, from the Old Babylonian period onward he was also closely associated with Harran. The importance of this city as his cult center grew in the first millennium BCE, as reflected in Neo-Hittite, Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources. Sin&#x27;s temple survived in later periods as well, under Achaemenid, Seleucid and Roman rule. Sin was also worshiped in many other cities in Mesopotamia. Temples dedicated to him existed for example in Tutub, which early on was considered another of his major cult centers, as well as in Urum, Babylon, Uruk, Nippur and Assur. The extent to which beliefs pertaining to him influenced the Sabians, a religious community who lived in Harran after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, is disputed.

==Names==
While it is agreed that the two primary names of the Mesopotamian moon god, Nanna and Sin (Suen), originated in two different languages, respectively Sumerian and Akkadian, it is not possible to differentiate between them as designations of separate deities, as they effectively fully merged at an early date. points out this phenomenon is already attested in sources from Lagash from the Early Dynastic period, where the name Nanna does not appear, and Sin is the form used in both Sumerian and Akkadian context. The process of conflation presumably started prior to the invention of cuneiform. Sometimes the double name Nanna-Suen was used, as evidenced for example by a short theological text from the Ur III period listing the main deities of the official pantheon. It is sometimes used to refer to this god in modern Assyriological publications too.

===Nanna===
The precise etymology of the name Nanna is unknown, though it is agreed that it is not a genitive construction. It is first attested in the Uruk period. In earliest cuneiform texts from Uruk and Ur it was written as (d)LAK-32.NA, with NA possibly serving as a phonetic complement. The name of the city of Ur (Urim) was accordingly written as LAK-32.UNUGki (), &quot;residence of Nanna&quot;, per analogy with toponyms such as Zabalam, INANNA.UNUGki. In later periods LAK-32 coalesced with ≈†E≈† (the ideogram for &quot;brother&quot;), and Nanna&#x27;s name came to be written as d≈†E≈†+KI or d≈†E≈†.KI, though phonetic spellings such as &quot;na-an-na&quot; are attested too, for example as glosses in lexical lists.

In early Assyriological scholarship it was often assumed that the variant form Nannar was the standard form of the name, but further research demonstrated that it does not predate the Old Babylonian period. The writing &quot;dna-an-na-ar&quot; is attested in Akkadian and Elamite texts, and was the result of linguistic contamination between the theonym Nanna and the common Akkadian noun &quot;nannaru&quot;, &quot;light&quot;. As an epithet, &quot;nannaru&quot; could be used to address the moon god, but also Ishtar and Girra.

It is uncertain if the theonym Nanum attested in a theophoric name from Umma is a derivative of Nanna, while Nanni worshiped in Mari and in the kingdom of Khana was a female deity and might be related to Nanaya rather than the moon god.

===Sin===
In Akkadian the moon god was called Sin (S√Æn) or Suen (Su‚Äôen). The former is the standard reading of the name from the Old Babylonian period onward, while the latter was presumably the older uncontracted pronunciation. The etymology of this name remains uncertain. One of the inscriptions of Gudea from the third millennium BCE refers to Sin as a god &quot;whose name nobody can explain&quot;, which might be an indication that his name was already unclear and a subject of scribal speculation during his reign.

The name Sin was typically written in cuneiform as dEN.ZU, as possibly already attested in a text from the Uruk period, though oldest certain examples, such as entries in the god lists from Fara and Abu Salabikh, only date back to the Early Dynastic period. Most likely it initially developed as a rebus meant to graphically resemble the names of gods whose names had Sumerian etymologies and contained the element EN, for example Enlil. Various phonetic spellings are also attested, for example &quot;s√∫-en&quot;, &quot;s√≠-in&quot;, &quot;si-in&quot; and &quot;se-en&quot;. The large variety of these variants might indicate that the first sibilant was difficult to render in cuneiform. In early Akkadian, the sound /s/ was an affricate [ts], which would explain its initial representation with Z-signs and later with S-signs. 

A variant form of Sin&#x27;s name, Suinu, is also attested in texts from Ebla. It has been pointed out that an Eblaite lexical list with the entry &quot;s√∫-i-nu&quot; is the oldest available attestation of a phonetic spelling of the name. However, the logogram dEN.ZU was also used in this city. Additionally, in a translation of an Akkadian text written in the Ugaritic alphabetic script the name is rendered as &quot;sn&quot; (KTU 1.70, line 4), while in Aramaic the variants &quot;sn&quot;, &quot;syn&quot; and &quot;≈°n&quot; are attested. In the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible Sin&#x27;s name is rendered as &quot;san&quot; in the theophoric names Sennacherib (S√Æn-a·∏´·∏´e-erƒ´ba) and Sanballat (S√Æn-uballi·π≠). Alfonso Archi argues that the theonym &quot;syn&quot; attested in a number of inscriptions from South Arabia should be interpreted as a variant of Sin&#x27;s name too, and suggests vocalizing it similarly to the Eblaite form of the name. However, concludes that no certain cognates of Sin&#x27;s name have been identified in other Semitic languages, and &quot;syn&quot; (or &quot;sn&quot;), who according to him is only known from Thamudic inscription from Hadhramaut, should instead be interpreted as Sayin, the local sun god.

From the Old Babylonian period onward Sin&#x27;s name could be represented by the logogram d30 (), derived from the cuneiform numeral 30, symbolically associated with him due to the number of days in the lunar month. It was originally assumed that an even earlier example occurs in the writing of a personal name from the Ur III period, but subsequent research demonstrated that this was the result of erroneous collation. In the first millennium BCE d30 became the most common writing. For example, in the text corpus from Neo-Babylonian Uruk only a single text, a &quot;kudurru&quot; inscription of Ibni-Ishtar, uses dEN.ZU instead of d30. Uncommonly dNANNA was used in Akkadian texts as a sumerogram meant to be read as Sin.

===Dilimbabbar===
Next to Sin and Nanna, the best attested name of the moon god is dA≈†&quot;-im4-babbar&quot; (). It was originally assumed that it should be read as A≈°imbabbar, though it was subsequently proved that this depended on an erroneous collation. By 2016 the consensus view that Dilimbabbar is the correct reading was established based on the discovery of multiple passages providing phonetic syllabic spellings. The name can be translated as &quot;the shining one who walks alone&quot;. This meaning was originally established based on the now abandoned reading of the name, but it is still considered a valid translation. An alternate proposal relying on homophony of the element &quot;dilim&quot; and the logogram &quot;dilim2&quot; (LI≈†) is to explain Dilimbabbar as &quot;the shining bowl&quot;. The term &quot;dilim2&quot; was a loan from Akkadian &quot;tilimtu&quot;, &quot;bowl&quot;. Piotr Steinkeller notes that it is not impossible both proposals regarding the meaning of Dilimbabbar are correct, and that the scribes might have intentionally created puns depending on the well attested tradition of referring to the moon as a unique or solitary celestial body.

Dilimbabbar is already attested in the Early Dynastic god list from Abu Salabikh. The &quot;Zame Hymns&quot; from the same period link this title with the worship of the moon god in Urum (Tell Uqair). It is not certain if at this point in time it was understood as a title of Sin or as the name of a distinct deity of analogous character. Mark Glenn Hall notes that the absence of theophoric names invoking the moon god under this name from available sources might indicate that if Dilimbabbar was ever understood as a distinct deity this tradition disappeared very early on. However, Manfred Krebernik and Jan Lisman point out that in the &quot;Temple Hymns&quot; (hymn 37) Dilimbabbar is addressed as a shepherd of Sin, which they argue might be a relic of an intermediate stage between the existence of two independent moon gods and their full conflation.

For unknown reasons the name Dilimbabbar is absent from all the other known Early Dynastic sources, as well as these from the subsequent Sargonic and Ur III periods, with the next oldest attestation being identified in an inscription of Nur-Adad of Larsa from Ur from the Isin-Larsa period, which might reflect a rediscovery of the name by scribes under hitherto unknown circumstances. It remained in use through subsequent periods, down to the first millennium BCE.

The Akkadian epithet Namra·π£it was considered analogous to Dilimbabbar, as attested in the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; (tablet III, line 26). It can be translated as &quot;whose rise is luminous&quot;. Steinkeller points out that it is not a direct translation of Dilimbabbar, as it effectively leaves out the element &quot;dilim&quot;. Bendt Alster assumed that the equivalence was the result of late reinterpretation.

==Character==
Sin was understood both as an anthropomorphic deity representing the moon, and as the astral body itself. He was responsible for providing light during the night. His luminous character could be highlighted with epithets such as &quot;the luminary of the heavens and earth&quot; (&quot;nannƒÅr ≈°am√™ u er·π£eti&quot;) or &quot;the luminary of all creation&quot; (&quot;nannƒÅr kullati binƒ´ti&quot;). The growth of the moon over the course of the month was reflected in comparing Sin to the growth of fruit (Akkadian &quot;inbu&quot;, Sumerian &quot;gurun&quot;) as attested in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources, especially . However, it was not applied consistently as a designation for a specific phase of the moon. Lunar eclipses were believed to be the result of Sin being surrounded by seven evil &quot;utukku&quot; sent by Anu.

Next to his astral aspect, Sin&#x27;s other main role has been described as that of a pastoral deity. He was associated with cattle and with dairy products. This link is reflected in his secondary names Abkar, &quot;shining cow&quot;, and Ablulu, &quot;the one who makes the cows abundant&quot;. He could be addressed as a herdsman in astral context, with stars being poetically described as his herd. In addition to cows, he could also be associated with sheep and with wild animals inhabiting steppes, especially ibexes and gazelles.

Sin was perceived as a benign deity who could be petitioned for help. He was responsible for guaranteeing abundance and growth, especially in Ur and Harran, which most likely reflects the well attested phenomenon of locally assigning such a role to tutelary deities of specific areas. It was also believed that he could provide people with offspring, as evidenced by prayer in which he is asked for that by childless worshipers, both men and women. He was also believed to aid pregnant women, both during the beginning of pregnancy and in labour. This aspect of his character is highlighted in the incantation &quot;Cow of S√Æn&quot;, which states that he would send a pair of &quot;lamassu&quot; goddesses to help mothers with difficult births. The common epithet of Sin, &quot;father&quot; (&quot;a-a&quot;), underlined his ability to cause growth and bring abundance. However, it also reflected his role as a senior member of his pantheon, as well as his authority over deities regarded as his children or servants. It has also been suggested that it metaphorically referred to him as the divine representation of the full moon, with texts instead describing him as a youthful god instead reflecting his role as the new moon. Another epithet commonly applied to him was &quot;lugal&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). Presumably it constituted an implicit reference to his status as the tutelary god of Ur. In the first millennium BCE, as the god of Harran he could be called Bƒìl-·∏™arrƒÅn (dEN.KASKAL), &quot;lord of Harran&quot;. This title appears particularly commonly in theophoric names.

Sin could also function as a divine judge in the underworld, as attested for example in the so-called &quot;First Elegy of the Pushkin Museum&quot;, in which a man named Ludingira hopes that he will proclaim a good verdict for his deceased father. This role might have originally developed as a way to explain why the moon is not visible for a part of each month. The composition in mention states that his judgment took place on the day of the disappearance of the moon (Sumerian &quot;u4-n√°&quot;, Akkadian &quot;≈´m bubbuli&quot;). However, Dina Katz argues that in contrast with the frequent assignment of a similar role to Shamash, Sin was usually not associated with judgment of either the living or the dead. References to both of them acting as judges are nonetheless known from Old Babylonian inscriptions.

In Mesopotamian medicine skin diseases, especially leprosy (&quot;sa·∏´ar≈°ubb√ª&quot;), as well as epileptic symptoms, could be interpreted as a manifestation of Sin&#x27;s wrath. The former are also mentioned in curse formulas as a punishment he could inflict upon oath breakers.

===As the head of the pantheon===
A number of sources attest the existence of a tradition in which Sin was regarded as the sole head of the Mesopotamian pantheon or a deity equal in rank to the traditional kings of the gods, Anu and Enlil. According to Wilfred G. Lambert, most of the evidence for this view postdates the reign of Meli-Shipak II, and indicates it might have been particularly popular in Harran. An Old Babylonian literary composition written in Sumerian describes Sin as the head of the divine assembly (Ub≈°u‚Äôukkin),with Anu, Enlil, Inanna, Utu, Enki and Ninhursag serving as his advisers. Two of his titles known from the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, d&quot;Ukkin&quot; (&quot;the assembly&quot;) and Ukkin-uru (&quot;mighty assembly&quot;), might reflect this portrayal. Some Old Babylonian theophoric names might also be connected to the view that Sin was the head of the pantheon, namely S√Æn-bƒìl-ili (&quot;Sin is the lord of the gods&quot;), S√Æn-≈°ar-ili (&quot;Sin is the king of the gods&quot;) or S√Æn-il-ili (&quot;Sin is god of the gods&quot;). Lambert notes that while similar names invoking other gods, for example Shamash and Adad, are also known, S√Æn-bƒìl-ili is ultimately the most common.

Examples of texts elevating Sin&#x27;s rank are known from Ur from the period of the Neo-Assyrian governor S√Æn-balƒÅssu-iqbi&#x27;s reign. The moon god was in this case seemingly reinterpreted as a &quot;local Enlil‚Äù, acting as the king of the gods in Ur. It has been argued that the view that Sin was the supreme god was later particularly enthusiastically supported by the last Neo-Babylonian ruler, Nabonidus. In one of his inscriptions from Harran Sin is described as the &quot;lord of the gods&quot; who possessed &quot;Enlilship&quot;, &quot;Anuship&quot; and &quot;Eaship&quot;. However, Melanie Gro√ü stresses that Nabonidus&#x27; devotion should for the most part not be treated as an unusual phenomenon, save for the fact that Harran was not the center of his empire. She notes that the elevation of city deities significant for specific rulers to the top of the pantheon of the respective states is well documented for example in the case of Marduk and Ashur. Aino H√§tinen points out that in Harran similar formulas were used to refer to Sin by Ashurbanipal, and are thus not unique to Nabonidus and do not necessarily indicate elevation of this god during his reign. She suggests both Nabonidus and Ashurbanipal relied on so-called &quot;Theology of the Moon&quot;, a concept well attested in explanatory texts from the first millennium BCE according to which Sin possessed divine powers (Sumerian &quot;ƒùarza&quot;, Akkadian &quot;par·π£≈´&quot;) equal to these of Anu, Enlil and Ea during the first half of the lunar month.

==Iconography==

Despite Sin&#x27;s popularity documented in textual sources, depictions of him are not common in Mesopotamian art. His most common attribute was the crescent. In accordance with the appearance of the new moon in the latitude of Mesopotamia, it was consistently represented as recumbent. It was frequently compared to bull horns and to a barge. On seals, Sin could be depicted with the crescent either placed on his tiara or atop a standard he held. It was also used to represent him on &quot;kudurru&quot;, decorated boundary stones. It consistently occurs in the upper section of such objects, next to symbols of Shamash and Ishtar, though their exact arrangement can vary. A survey of 110 stones or their fragments indicated that this trio of deities is depicted on all known &quot;kudurru&quot;. Aniconic portrayals of Sin as the lunar crescent also predominate in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian art. Furthermore, the logogram dU4.SAKAR () which could be used to write his name was derived from a term referring to the crescent.

Like other Mesopotamian gods Sin was depicted as a mature, bearded man dressed in a flounced robe. In some cases he holds a mace or a stick, with the latter occurring particularly often, though these attributes were not exclusively associated with him and cannot be used to identify depictions of him. A further object associated with him in art was a tripod, possibly a candelabrum, sometimes with a lunar crescent on top and with an unidentified sandal-like object hanging from it.

In some cases, Sin could be portrayed rising from between two mountains, similarly to Shamash, and Dominique Collon has suggests that in some cases reassessment of works of art often presumed to represent the latter in this situation might be necessary due to this similarity. Depictions of Sin in a barge are known too, and presumably reflect the belief that he traversed the night sky in this vehicle, as documented in textual sources. Based on Old Babylonian sources is presumed that the lunar barge was considered a representation of a phase of the moon, specifically the gibbous moon. It could be metaphorically compared to a type bowl (Sumerian &quot;dilim2&quot;, Akkadian &quot;tilimtu&quot;), apparently also regarded as an attribute of the moon god. Piotr Steinkeller suggests that the latter might have been considered a representation of the half moon.

Ningal, the wife of Sin, could be depicted alongside him for example in banquet scenes. On the stele of Ur-Nammu she sits in his lap. This type of depictions was meant to display the intimate nature of a connection between the deities and highlight their ability to act in unison, and is also attested for Bau and Ningirsu.

==Associations with other deities==
===Parents and siblings===
Enlil and Ninlil were usually regarded as Sin&#x27;s parents. It has been argued that an Early Dynastic text from Abu Salabikh already refers to Enlil and Ninlil as his parents, though an alternate view is that he oldest certain evidence only goes back to the reign of Ur-Nammu of the Third Dynasty of Ur. It has been argued that in this period he might have started to be viewed as a son of Enlil for political reasons. The compilers of the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; apparently did not acknowledge this tradition directly, as in contrast with Ninurta Sin does not appear in the section focused on Enlil and his family. However, his status as his son is seemingly reflected in the epithets Dumununna, &quot;son of the prince&quot;, and Dumugi, &quot;noble son&quot;. Sin is also kept separate from Enlil in the Old Babylonian forerunner of this text, which has been argued to be a reflection of an earlier tradition in which they were not viewed as son and father. While references to Anu being the father of Sin are also known, they are most likely metaphorical, and do not represent a distinct genealogical tradition.

In the myth &quot;Enlil and Ninlil&quot; Sin&#x27;s brothers are Nergal, Ninazu and Enbilulu, though the latter two gods were commonly regarded as sons of different parents instead. Enbilulu in particular is not attested as a son of Enlil and Ninlil in any other sources. Based on their shared status as sons of Enlil Sin and Nergal were sometimes referred to as the &quot;big twins&quot;, and in this context were identified with Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea. The connection between Lugal-Irra and Sin seemingly depended on the latter&#x27;s occasional role as a judge in the underworld. An astronomical text equates the pair Sin and Nergal with Latarak and Lulal, but this attestation is unparalleled in other sources.

===Wife and children===
Sin&#x27;s wife was Ningal. They are already attested as a couple in Early Dynastic sources, and they were consistently paired with each other in all regions of Mesopotamia. Derivatives of Ningal were associated with local moon gods in the Ugaritic, Hurrian and Hittite pantheons. However, the old proposal that Hurrians, and by extension Hittites and inhabitants of Ugarit, received her from Harran is regarded as unproven, as she does not appear in association with this city in any sources from the second millennium BCE. She is also absent from Luwian sources pertaining to the worship of Sin of Harran in the first millennium BCE.

The best attested children of Sin were Utu (Shamash) and Inanna (Ishtar). The connection between these three deities depended on their shared astral character, with Sin representing the moon and his children, who could be identified as twins - the sun and Venus. Numerous instances of Inanna being directly referred to as his oldest daughter are known. While alternate traditions about her parentage are attested, it is agreed they were less significant and ultimately she was most commonly recognized as a daughter of Sin and Ningal. It has been pointed out that apparent references to Anu being her father instead might only designate him as an ancestor. Similarly to how Sin was referred as the &quot;great boat of heaven&quot; (&quot;dm√°-gul-la-an-na&quot;), his son was the &quot;small boat of heaven&quot; (&quot;dm√°-b√†n-da-an-na&quot;), which reflected his subordinate status. These titles additionally reflected the Mesopotamian belief that the moon was larger than the sun. As an extension of her marriage to the sun god, the dawn goddess Aya was regarded as a daughter-in-law of Sin, as reflected by her common epithet &quot;kallatum&quot;.

Further attested children of Sin include the goddesses Amarazu and Amara·∏´ea, known from the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Ningublaga (the city god of Kiabrig) and Numushda (the city god of Kazallu). Ningublaga&#x27;s connection with the moon god is well attested in god lists (&quot;An = Anum&quot;, the Weidner god list, the Nippur god list) and other sources, one example being the formula &quot;servant of Sin and Ningublaga,&quot; known from an Old Babylonian cylinder seal. While he was not always explicitly identified as his son, with such references lacking for example from &quot;An = Anum&quot;, direct statements confirming the existence of such a tradition have been identified in an inscription of Abisare of Larsa and in a hymn dedicated to Ningublaga&#x27;s temple in Kiabrig. Designating Numushda as a son of Sin was likely meant to be a way to assimilate him into the pantheon of lower Mesopotamia, and might be based on perceived similarity to Ningublaga. The tradition according to which he was a son of the moon god is absent from sources from the third millennium BCE. Additionally, a single literary text calls Numushda a son of Enki, rather than Sin and Ningal. Amarazu and Amara·∏´ea are overall sparsely attested, and despite their status as Sin&#x27;s daughters in god lists and the incantation series &quot;Udug Hul&quot; there is no evidence they were worshiped alongside him in Ur. The reason behind the association between these two goddesses and the moon god is unknown.

While references to Ninegal as a daughter of Sin are known, in this context the name is treated as an epithet of Inanna, and there is no evidence Ninegal understood as a distinct goddess was associated with him in any way. Another deity associated with Ishtar who was sometimes described as daughter of Sin was the love goddess Nanaya. However, this tradition seems to stem from the close connection between Nanaya and Inanna, as for example the &quot;Hymn to the City of Arbela&quot; in a passage focused on Ishtar of Arbela refers to Nanaya as a daughter of Sin, but also syncretises her with the goddess being praised. Sources where Nanaya&#x27;s father is instead either Anu or Urash (the male tutelary god of Dilbat, rather than the earth goddess of the same name) are known too. Only in Assyria in the Neo-Assyrian period she was regarded as a daughter of Sin. A god list from Nineveh might indicate that she was viewed as a daughter of the moon god specifically when she was counted among deities belonging to the entourage of Enlil. A further goddess related to Inanna, Annunitum, could similarly be addressed as a daughter of Sin, though this tradition is only preserved in inscriptions of Nabonidus documenting the repair of her temple in Sippar. Due to identification with Inanna, the Hurrian and Elamite goddess Pinikir is referred to as a daughter of Sin and Ningal in a text written in Akkadian but found in a corpus of Hurro-Hittite rituals.

In a single &quot;Maql√ª&quot; incantation, Manzat, the goddess of the rainbow, appears as the sister of Shamash, and by extension as daughter of his parents, Sin and Ningal.

A tradition according to which Ninazu was a son of Sin is also known. Frans Wiggermann proposes that the occasional association between these two gods might have reflected the dependence of Enegi, Ninazu&#x27;s cult center, on nearby Ur.

In the first millennium BCE a tradition according to which Nuska was a son of Sin developed in Harran. suggests that it might have reflected Aramaic influence and that it resulted from a connection between Sin, Nuska and hitherto unknown deities worshiped by this group.

While assertions that Ishkur was regarded as a further son of Sin can be found in older literature, no primary sources confirm the existence of such a tradition.

===Court===
Sin&#x27;s sukkal (attendant deity) was Alammu≈°. He and Ningublaga were often associated with each other and could be even referred to as twin brothers. Manfred Krebernik notes that this might indicate that he was also viewed as a son of the moon god. However, no direct evidence supporting this notion has been identified, and therefore whether he was ever regarded as a child of Sin remains impossible to ascertain. Alammu≈° also possessed his own attendant, Urugal.

In the Old Babylonian forerunner of &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Nindara is listed among the deities belonging to the entourage of Sin. This god was originally worshiped as the husband of Nanshe in the state of Lagash in the Early Dynastic period. In &quot;An = Anum&quot; itself he and Sin are directly identified with each other (tablet III, line 65), and the lines following this statement list Nanshe and their children. However, there is no evidence that this equation was responsible for the lack of references to Nindara in the Sealand archives, as Nanshe was not worshiped in association with Sin in this context. Nin-MAR.KI, who was traditionally regarded as Nanshe&#x27;s daughter, is also placed in the section of &quot;An = Anum&quot; dedicated to Sin, though according to Walther Sallaberger her presence there might reflect her well attested association with cattle, which she shared with the moon god. Further members of his entourage include deities such as Nineigara, referred to his &quot;lady of the treasury&quot; (&quot;nin-√®rim&quot;, Akkadian &quot;bƒìlet i≈°itti&quot;) and &quot;obedient housekeeper&quot;(&quot;munus-agrig ≈°u-dim4-ma&quot;, Akkadian &quot;abarakkatu saniqtu&quot;), Nimintabba, and Ninurima. In medical texts, the demon Bennu, responsible for causing epilepsy, is described as his &quot;deputy&quot; (&quot;≈°an√™&quot;) as well.

In &quot;An = Anum&quot; Suzianna and Ninimma, both usually regarded as courtiers of Enlil, are also identified as Sin&#x27;s nurses.

===Other lunar deities===

The Hurrian moon god, variously known as Ku≈°u·∏´, Umbu or U≈°u, was identified with Sin and his name was sometimes written logographically as dEN.ZU or d30. It is possible that his character was influenced by exposure to Mesopotamian culture and the image of the moon god in it in particular.

Equivalence between Sin and Yarikh is documented in an Akkadian-Amorite bilingual lexical list presumed to originate in lower Mesopotamia and dated to the Old Babylonian period. The two of them are also equated in an Ugaritic god list. The name of Yarikh (Yari·∏´) and its variants are cognate with terms referring both to the moon and to month as a measure of time in multiple Semitic languages, including both Amorite and Ugaritic. While neither the names Nanna nor Sin share such a linguistic affinity, the respective Sumerian (&quot;itud&quot;) and Akkadian (&quot;war·∏´um&quot;) words for moon and month are likewise the same. As noted by Nick Wyatt, Nikkal, the counterpart of Ningal regarded as the wife of Yarikh in Ugarit, likely reached the coastal city via a Hurrian intermediary, and it is possible that the myth describing their marriage was based on a Mesopotamian or Hurrian original, focused on either Sin or Ku≈°u·∏´. However, Steve A. Wiggins states that despite the connection between Sin and Yarikh the latter shows a number of traits distinct from his counterpart, for example literary texts at times compare him to a dog, an animal not associated with the Mesopotamian moon god.
In Hittite and Luwian sources the logographic writings d30 and dEN.ZU were used to render the name of the Anatolian moon god Arma. As noted by , while d30 was also used to represent the name of the Hattian moon god Ka≈°ku in the corresponding version of the myth &quot;The Moon that Fell from Heaven&quot;, it is improbable that it designates him in cultic texts, as he was a deity of little relevance in Hattian and Hittite religion.

In Emar, d30 might have been used as a logogram to represent the name of the local god Saggar, who in addition to fulfilling a lunar role was also the divine personification of the Sinjar Mountains. Both he and Sin (Suinu) were worshiped in Ebla in the third millennium BCE, possibly with each representing a different lunar phase. It has been suggested that the logogram dEN.ZU designated Saggar in this city, but according to Alfonso Archi this is unlikely. Lunar character is sometimes also proposed for a further Eblaite deity, Hadabal (dNI-&quot;da&quot;-KUL), though Archi similarly disagrees with this view. However, he does accept the possibility that the theophoric name of a king of Ibubu mentioned in an Eblaite text, &quot;Li-im&quot;-dEN.ZU, a different deity than Sin was meant.

The logogram d30 was also used to render the name of the Elamite moon deity, possibly to be identified with Napir, though notes that in one case the name Nannar appears to be attested in Elamite contex, specifically in an inscription of Shilhak-Inshushinak.

A bilingual Akkadian-Kassite lexical list indicates that the Kassite deity regarded as the counterpart of Sin was ≈†i-·∏™U (reading of the second sign uncertain), well attested as an element of theophoric names, though he was more commonly equated with Marduk in similar sources.

==Worship==
Sin was recognized as a major deity all across ancient Mesopotamia. His status was already high in the earliest periods to which the history of the Mesopotamian pantheon can be traced. It is presumed that Sin was actively worshiped in most of the major cities of the region, with remains of multiple temples dedicated to him identified during excavations both in Babylonia and in Assyria.

===Ur===
====Early history====

Ur was already well established as the cult center of the moon god, initially under his Sumerian name Nanna, in Early Dynastic times, as attested in the &quot;Zame Hymns&quot; from Abu Salabikh. His primary temple this city was Eki≈°nugal, &quot;house of the great light&quot;. Sanctuaries bearing this name also existed in other cities, which is presumed to reflect Ur&#x27;s central importance in the sphere of religion. The first certain attestation of this ceremonial name has been dated to the reign of Utu-hegal, though it is possible it was already used in the times of Eannatum. Through history, it was rebuilt or patronized by multiple rulers, including Naram-Sin of Akkad, Ur-Nammu of Ur, various rulers from the Isin-Larsa period, Kurigalzu I of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon, Marduk-nadin-ahhe and Adad-apla-iddina of the Second Dynasty of Isin, and Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Other houses of worship dedicated to Sin existed in Ur too. For example, liturgical texts mention the ceremonial name Edimanna, &quot;house, bond of heaven&quot;. Enamnunna, &quot;house of princeliness&quot;, rebuilt by Sin-Iddinam, might have been located in Ur too. A ziggurat dedicated to Sin was constructed during the reign of Ur-Nammu. It bore the name Elugalgalgasisa, &quot;house of the king who lets counsel flourish&quot;.

Kings from the Third Dynasty of Ur believed themselves to be appointed to their position by Sin. His cult flourished during their reigns, as evidenced both by structures uncensored during excavations and by the numerous dedicatory inscriptions. An inscription from this period refers to him as one of the major members of the pantheon, next to Enlil, Ninlil, Inanna, Enki, Nergal, Ninurta, Nuska, Ninshubur and the deified hero Gilgamesh, included in the enumeration due to his importance for the ruling house. Ibbi-Sin at one point dedicated the image of a &quot;red dog of Meluhha&quot; to Sin. According to the document describing this offering, the animal bore the evocative name &quot;He bites!&quot;

====The &quot;en&quot; priestesses====
An important aspect of the lunar cult in Ur was the institution of the &quot;en&quot; priestess. In Akkadian its holders were referred to as &quot;entum&quot;. Their residence was known as Gipar, and while initially separate in the Old Babylonian period it was combined into a single complex with the temple of the moon god&#x27;s wife, Ningal. Not much is known about the duties of the &quot;en&quot; in the sphere of cult, though they apparently played a role in building and renovation activities. They are chiefly documented in sources from between the Sargonic and early Old Babylonian periods. They were typically daughters of kings.
Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon of Akkad, was a particularly famous &quot;en&quot; priestess. She is also the earliest attested holder of this office, with available evidence including the so-called &quot;disc of Enheduanna&quot;, seals of her servants, and literary compositions copied in later periods traditionally attributed to her. It is it not certain if the office of &quot;en&quot; was only established at this point in time as an innovation, or if it developed from an earlier Early Dynastic title tied to the cult of the moon god. Later &quot;en&quot; priestesses include , daughter of Sargon&#x27;s grandson Naram-Sin of Akkad (named as &quot;zirru priestess of the god Nanna, spouse of the god N[anna], entu priestess of the god Sin at Ur&quot;); Enannepada, daughter of Ur-Baba of Lagash and the only holder of this office from the Second Dynasty of Lagash; , daughter of Ur-Nammu of Ur; , a contemporary and possibly daughter of Shulgi; her successors Enuburzianna and Enmahgalana, the former also selected during the reign of Shulgi and the latter shortly after by Amar-Sin; , daughter of Ishme-Dagan of Isin who retained her position after his death and conquest of the city of Ur by Larsa; En≈°akiag-Nanna, daughter of Sumuel of Larsa; and her successor , daughter of Kudur-Mabuk of Larsa and sister of Warad-Sin and Rim-S√Æn I. She was the last known holder of this office before its revival of in the Neo-Babylonian period.

As attested for the first time during the reign of Amar-Sin, separate office of &quot;en&quot; of Nanna existed in nearby Karzida. Only two of its holders are known, both of them active contemporarily with this king: Enagazianna and En-Nanna-Amar-Suen-kiagra. Sparsely attested Enmegalanna, known only from a single reference to funerary offerings meant for her from the early Old Babylonian period, might have been a further &quot;en&quot; from Karzida, though it is ultimately unknown whether she resided there or in Ur.

It is presumed that while prominent in the third and early second millennia BCE, the institution of &quot;en&quot; gradually declined and finally disappeared.

====Later evidence====
Sources dealing with the worship of Sin in Ur after the Old Babylonian period are less common than these from early periods.

While Ur is not directly referenced in any of the texts agreed to come from the archives of the First Sealand dynasty, it is nonetheless possible that both the city and Sin had a particular importance to rulers belonging to it. He is one of the best attested deities in the Sealand text corpus next to Nanshe, Ishtar, Ninurta and Shamash. He is the single most common deity in theophoric names from it, which reflects his popularity in the onomasticon attested from Old Babylonian to Middle Babylonian period. At the same time, other evidence points to his cult only having a modest scope, which might indicate its center was a temple only loosely tied to the royal administration. Three texts indicate he could receive offerings in the beginning of a lunar month, during the new moon. He is also invoked alongside Enlil, Ea and the respective spouses of all three of these gods (Ningal, Ninlil and Damkina) in a seal inscription of Akurduana. In addition to the worship of Sin himself, offerings to a distinct manifestation of Inanna known under the epithet &quot;daughter of Sin&quot;, d(INANNA.)DUMU(.M√ç)-(d)30(‚ÄêNA)/dEN.ZU are also documented in the Sealand texts.

With the exception of Kurigalzu I, rulers of the Kassite dynasty showed little interest in Ur. During his reign the Edublama·∏´, &quot;house, exalted door socket&quot;, originally a court of law dedicated to Sin build by Shu-Ilishu to commemorate the return of a statue of this god from Anshan, was rebuilt as a temple.

Little is known about the worship of Sin in Ur during the reign of the Second Dynasty of Isin and beyond, as no late temple archive has been discovered, and the information is limited to scarce archeological evidence for building activity and a small number of commemorative inscriptions. The oldest of them come from the middle of the seventh century BCE, when the city was under the control of a local dynasty of governors loyal to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. It is uncertain to what degree the Neo-Assyrian rulers themselves were involved in the religious traditions of Ur. One of the governors, S√Æn-balƒÅssu-iqbi, son of Ningal-iddin and contemporary of Ashurbanipal, apparently capitalized on a local economic boom to renovate Eki≈°nugal. He also rebuilt Elugalgalgasisa.

After the period of S√Æn-balƒÅssu-iqbi&#x27;s activity sources pertaining to the worship of Sin in Ur only reappear during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, who similarly renovated Eki≈°nugal. He might have been motivated by the importance he attributed to the moon god as responsible for determining destiny through lunar omens. His successor Nabonidus carried out further construction work pertaining to the cult of Sin in Ur. He commissioned multiple large building projects, including the reconstruction of houses of worship connected to Sin and his wife Ningal. Elugalgalgasisa was among them, and in an inscription commemorating this event the king asserted work on the same structure had earlier been made by Ur-Nammu and Shulgi. He also showed interest in earlier traditions of Ur and revived the institution of the &quot;en&quot; priestess, placing his daughter in this role and bestowing the new name Ennigaldi-Nanna (&quot;priestess requested by Nanna&quot;) upon her. Her birth name is unknown. In an inscription Nabonidus claimed that he relied on a document authored by while restoring the office. Paul-Alain Beaulieu notes that his investigation of the nature of the office of &quot;en&quot; priestess in the previous periods of Mesopotamian history can be compared to a degree to the work of a modern archeologist.

===Harran===
====Early history====
In upper Mesopotamia, the most widely recognized cult center of Sin was Harran. Melanie Gro√ü states that Sin might have been introduced to Harran from Ur during the reign of the Third Dynasty of Ur, when the city served primarily as a trading center. Similar view has been advanced by Steven Holloway. However, Harran is first linked with Sin in texts from the Old Babylonian period. The city itself is already attested in Eblaite sources from the twenty fourth century BCE. They indicate it was among the settlements which officially recognized the hegemony of Ebla over northern Syria. While Sin (Suinu) was worshiped in this area, offerings to him are not mentioned frequently in the Eblaite archive, and the city regarded as his cult center was apparently NI-&quot;rar&quot;. Alfonso Archi argues that he was not introduced there from lower Mesopotamia, and points out he was locally associated with the Balikh River. A single source mentions an individual who served as a priest of both Suinu and Bali·∏´a, a duo of deities representing this watercourse.

====Second millennium BCE====

The oldest evidence for the worship of Sin in Harran might be an inscription of Naram-Suen of Eshnunna dated to the late nineteenth century BCE, though its reading remains uncertain, and it is generally assumed the earliest unambiguous references to &quot;Sin of Harran&quot; (dEN.ZU &quot;≈°a ·∏´a-ar-ra-nimki&quot;) occur in texts from Mari from the reign of Zimri-Lim (1782-1759 BCE), such as a letter mentioning a temple dedicated to him. It states that the local ruler, Asdi-Takim, signed a treaty with the kings of Zalmaqqum and the elders of DUMU-&quot;iamina&quot; in this house of worship. It was known as (íÇçíÑæíÑæ), &quot;house which gives joy&quot;, though this ceremonial name is not attested before the Neo-Assyrian period. Due to continuous occupation of Harran no buildings predating late antiquity have been identified during excavations, and as of 2023 the exact location of the temple of Sin is unknown.

The worship of Sin in Harran is not well documented through the rest of the second millennium BCE, though he does appear among the divine witnesses in a treaty between ≈†uppiluliuma I of the Hittite Empire and ≈†attiwaza of the Mitanni Empire as one of the deities of the latter of these two states. Alfonso Archi points out that he and Ku≈°u·∏´, the Hurrian moon god, are listed separately in this source. There is no evidence that Sin of Harran was worshiped by Hittites. However, he was incorporated into Luwian religion, as indicated by references to his introduction to Tar·∏´unta≈°≈°a from the second millennium BCE. Manfred Hutter states that his cult spread there from Kizzuwatna, where he and Ku≈°u·∏´ were the moon deities favored by Luwians, in contrast with Arma&#x27;s popularity among western Luwian communities.

====First millennium BCE====
The popularity of Sin of Harran grew in the Iron Age. He became an important deity in the local pantheon of Tabal. Even though Arma continued to be worshiped by the Luwian communities residing in Pamphylia, Cilicia, Caria and Lycia, among eastern Luwians he was entirely displaced by Sin of Harran as the moon god. The latter is mentioned alongside deities such as Tar·∏´unz and Kubaba in an inscription of on a stela from Til Barsip. He also appears alongside Kubaba in curse formulas in multiple inscriptions from Tabal.

While no references to Sin of Harran occur in Assyrian sources from the Middle Assyrian period, even though it is possible his cult center was incorporated into the Middle Assyrian administrative system as early as during the reign of Tukulti-Ninurta I, evidence for royal patronage of his temple is available from the subsequent Neo-Assyrian period. Steven W. Holloway suggests the Neo-Assyrian Empire strived to adopt the cult of Sin, popular among the local population, for the sake of royal propaganda. It attained a particular importance in Assyria from the reign of Sargon II onward. Esarhaddon received astronomical reports from the &quot;galamƒÅ·∏´u&quot; (&quot;chief lamentation priest&quot;) of Sin of Harran. Ashurbanipal renovated the E·∏´ul·∏´ul and most likely took part in an &quot;akitu&quot; celebration in this city, possibly while returning from his campaign against Egypt.

Royal cult of Sin in Harran ceased after the fall of Assyria, and after the defeat of A≈°≈°ur-uballi·π≠ II his temple was looted by Nabopolassar and his Median allies (&quot;Ummanmanda&quot;). However, royal interest in it was revived later on in the Neo-Babylonian period by Nabonidus. His mother Adad-guppi most likely hailed from this city, and she was either a priestess of Sin or an upper class laywoman particularly devoted to this god. It has been suggested that her personal devotion to the tutelary god of Harran influenced the religious outlook of her son. The rebuilding of E·∏´ul·∏´ul started during the reign of Nabonidus, but it is not known if the project was complete by the time he was deposed by Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE.

Harran retained importance as a religious site after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire through the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods, though references to it are less common than in earlier sources. Presumably the temple of Sin retained its form from the reign of Nabonidus under the Achaemenids, but it was most likely rebuilt under Greek rule. Coins from the mint established in Harran in the late fourth century BCE under the rule of Antigonus I Monophthalmus are marked with a crescent, which is presumed to be an indication of continuation of the worship of Sin. Lunar symbols continued to appear on locally minted coins in the Roman period, with examples available from the reigns of Roman emperors such as Lucius Verus, Septimius Severus and Elagabalus.

===Other areas===
====Nippur====
Sin is already mentioned in an Early Dynastic inscription of Lugalzagesi from Nippur, with the name Nanna only appearing in sources from this city later on. A temple dedicated to Sin known under the ceremonial name Eki≈°nugal existed in Bƒ´t-Suenna, which was seemingly a suburb of this city. The so-called &quot;Nippur Compendium&quot; mentions a nameless temple dedicated to him located in Nippur itself, and states that he was worshiped there alongside Ningal, Ishtar, Shamash, Shuzianna and Kalkal. He was also venerated in one of the four chapels in the temple of Ninlil, with the other three dedicated to Ninhursag, Nintinugga and Nisaba. In theophoric names from Kassite Nippur, Sin is the single most common deity, appearing 129 times in available sources in this context.

====Babylon and Borsippa====
In Babylon, Sin is first attested in the Old Babylonian period during the reign of Sumu-abum, who constructed a temple dedicated to him, though it is not certain to which of the sanctuaries documented in later sources it corresponded. One of them shared the name Eki≈°nugal with the temple from Ur, as attested in inscriptions of Hammurabi, Samsu-iluna and Nebuchadnezzar II. A second house of worship dedicated to him, Enitendu, &quot;house of (pleasant) rest&quot;, existed in the east of the same city, as indicated by inscriptions of Ammi-Ditana and Ammi-Saduqa. Sin was also worshiped in the temple of Bƒìlet-BƒÅbili, a local hypostasis of Ishtar, presumably due to his well documented role as the father of this goddess. In the Seleucid period, Antiochos I on one occasion made offerings to Sin in Babylon. However, it is presumed that his religious policy with regards to veneration of local deities was unique and should not be regarded as the standard for Seleucid rulers, as it finds no direct parallel in sources pertaining to other members of this dynasty.

Sin was also worshiped in the immediate proximity of Babylon in Damru, as evidenced by his epithet &quot;bƒìl Damru&quot;, &quot;lord of Damru&quot;. A temple dedicated to him bearing the ceremonial name Egissubiduga, &quot;house whose shade is pleasant&quot;, existed in this settlement.

Evidence for the worship of Sin in nearby Borsippa is available from the Neo-Babylonian period and late sources, though he was likely present in this city earlier already. In the Ezida temple complex, which was dedicated to Nabu (earlier Marduk, initially Tutu), there existed a sanctuary dedicated to him known as Edimanna, &quot;house, bond of heaven&quot;, as attested in an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II commemorating its rebuilding and in a Neo-Babylonian administrative text. It is possible his presence in the local pantheon reflected a connection between him and Nanaya.

====Uruk====
In Uruk the worship of Sin is first documented in the Old Babylonian period, with an offering list using his Sumerian name and an administrative text the Akkadian one. His temple in this city was known under the ceremonial name Edumununna, &quot;house of the son of the prince&quot;. In the Neo-Babylonian period he was most likely worshiped in this city in a small chapel, so-called &quot;ekurrƒÅtu&quot;. Three manifestations of him received offerings, with Sin &quot;of the courtyard&quot; (&quot;≈°a kisalli&quot;) and &quot;of heaven&quot; (&quot;≈°a ≈°am√™&quot;) attested in addition to the standard form of this god. However, the significance of these two more specific manifestations was minor. In three cases, Sin and &quot;Sin of heaven&quot; appear in the same texts as two distinct deities.

A reference to a sanctuary of Sin occurs in a text from the reign of Darius the Great as well. He also continued to be venerated in Uruk in the Seleucid period, as indicated by references to him in both ritual and legal texts, as well as attested theophoric names invoking him. He might have been one of the deities worshiped in the Bƒ´t Rƒì≈°, &quot;head temple,&quot; a new temple complex dedicated to Anu and Antu which was built in this period. According to Julia Krul, it can be assumed that his presence in the local pantheon of Uruk was also the reason behind the introduction of Ningal and Ningublaga to the city documented in late sources.

====Other Babylonian cities====

While Sin was seemingly not actively worshiped in Early Dynastic Lagash, he appears among the deities invoked in an oath formula on the Stele of the Vultures, as well as in both Sumerian and Akkadian theophoric names identified in sources from this area, such as Amar-Suen and Puzur-Suen. Later on Naram-Sin might have built a temple dedicated to him in nearby Girsu.

In Urum Sin was worshiped in a temple known under the ceremonial name Eablua, &quot;house of teeming cattle&quot;. According to Andrew R. George the Edublama·∏´, &quot;house, exalted door socket&quot;, which was built in this city by NƒÅqimum of the MananƒÅ Dynasty near Kish was also dedicated to him.

Akshak was seemingly also regarded as a cult center of Sin, as evidenced by references to a &quot;sanga&quot; priest of this god residing there, as well as by the theophoric name dEN.ZU-LUGAL-&quot;Ak≈°akki&quot;, &quot;Sin in the king of Akshak&quot;.

In Sippar Sin is well documented in sources from the Old Babylonian period, appearing there for the first time on a seal from the reign of the local king , a contemporary of Sumu-la-El of Babylon. He had a temple in this city, Eidimanna, &quot;house, bond of heaven&quot;. However, no references to his cult occur in documents from later periods, and he is only attested again in this city during the reign of Nabonidus. It is not certain if this ruler reintroduced him to the city, or if he only promoted the status of a minor cult which existed there all along but was not referenced directly in available sources. Sin continued to be worshiped in Sippar under Persian rule as well.

In Larsa Sin was worshiped in a temple shared with Ningal in the Old Babylonian period, but no references to him occur in sources from this city from later times.

Sin and Ningal at some point replaced Inanna and Dumuzi as the tutelary deities of Kissig.

====The Diyala basin====
Sin played an important role in the Diyala basin, for example in an inscription of Dadusha of Eshnunna enumerating the major deities of his kingdom he is listed directly after Anu and Enlil, which is a position where usually Enki (Ea) would be expected to appear. It is possible that he had a temple in the city of Eshnunna itself, which might be mentioned in a year name of Ibal-pi-el II. Tutub was recognized as his cult center in this area, and excavations indicate that the temple dedicated to him existed in the Jemdat Nasr period already. An &quot;en&quot; priestess dedicated to him resided in this city, similarly as in Ur. However, the city eventually lost its importance as a cult center of Sin. A further house of worship dedicated to him has been identified during excavations in Tell Ishchali, most likely the site of ancient Nƒìrebtum.

Sin is also the most commonly occurring god in personal names known from tablets from the Chogha Gavaneh site in western Iran, which in the early second millennium BCE was an Akkadian settlement most likely connected to the kingdom of Eshnunna.

====Assyria====
While in Babylonia sanctuaries dedicated to Sin were typically located in cities associated with deities regarded as his relatives, for example his father Enlil in the case of Nippur and his daughter Ishtar in Uruk and Babylon, in Assyria they occur mostly in settlements which served as this region&#x27;s capitals at various points in time. A double temple dedicated jointly to him and Shamash, the E·∏´ul·∏´uldirdirra, &quot;house of surpassing joys&quot;, existed in Assur. It is not clear if this rarely used ceremonial name was influenced by the better attested , referring to the temple in Harran. It was rebuilt by Ashur-nirari I, Tukulti-Ninurta I and Ashurnasirpal II. A similar joint temple existed in Nineveh, as indicated in documents from the reign of Esarhaddon, though its name is presently unknown. Since yet another comparable double sanctuary was located in Dur-Sharrukin, it is possible that the topography of temples of Assur was used as a model for other cities which served as capitals at different points in the history of Assyria.

In the Old Assyrian period Sin was among the Mesopotamian deities most frequently worshiped by the inhabitants of the Old Assyrian trading colony (&quot;karum&quot;) in Kanesh.

==Mythology==
Despite his religious importance, Sin only uncommonly appears in myths, especially when compared with his children Ishtar and Shamash.

===&quot;Nanna-Suen&#x27;s Journey to Nibru&quot;===
The composition &quot;Nanna-Suen‚Äôs journey to Nibru&quot; describes the moon god&#x27;s journey to visit Enlil in his city, Nippur. It is presumed that this composition reflected a festival well attested in literary texts during which a statue of the moon god was transported by boat from Ur to Nippur. After a hymnic prologue praising Nippur, the narrative relays how Sin dispatches his servants to provide him with wood from various areas, including Ebla and Tummal, so that he can have a ship constructed to that end. Once it is finished, he prepares various gifts for Enlil, including cattle, sheep, birds, fish and other animals. He then embarks on his journey. He makes five stops along the way, in each case being welcomed by a local goddess: Ningirida in Enegi, ≈†erida in Larsa, Inanna in Uruk, Nin-unug in Shuruppak and Ninlil in Tummal, but despite their urging he does not share the cargo meant to be received by Enlil with any of them. After reaching Nippur, he is welcomed by the divine doorkeeper Kalkal, and finally meets Enlil. He requests a blessing for his city, Ur, which he receives in the closing lines of the composition.

===The Labbu myth===
Sin plays a prominent role in the Labbu myth. This composition is known only from a single poorly preserved copy from the library of Ashurbanipal. Due to the prominence of Sin and the presence of Tishpak it is possible that it originated in the kingdom of Eshnunna. Wilfred G. Lambert estimated that it was originally composed at some point between 1800 BCE and 800 BCE. Frans Wiggermann favors dating its composition to earlier than 1755 BCE. It deals with the conflict between gods and the eponymous monster. At the sight of Labbu Sin obscures his face with a cloak, which is presumed to reflect a lunar eclipse. Later he advises Tishpak, who has apparently been selected to battle the monster. He is thus responsible for coordinating the slaying of Labbu.

===&quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;===
In &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot; Ninshubur, the sukkal (attendant deity) of the eponymous goddess, is tasked with petitioning Nanna, as well as Enlil and Enki, in order to prevent her mistress from dying in the underworld. Ninshubur later enters the Eki≈°nugal to plead with him as instructed, but Nanna refuses to help her. It is presumed that his presence in this myth reflects his well attested role as Inanna&#x27;s father.

Dina Katz argues that a direct parallel to this passage can be found in the myth &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld&quot; and on this basis suggests an intertextual relation between these two compositions. She assumes &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot; was older and influenced &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld&quot;, with the opposite possibility being less likely. However, Alhena Gadotti disagrees with Katz&#x27;s proposal and argues that evidence for a connection between the two texts is lacking, and the passages are not directly parallel as &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld&quot; notably does not feature Nanna. However, she does point out a similar sequence is present in the composition preserved on tablet XII of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.

===&quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;===
In the &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; edition of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; some of the grave goods meant to deceased Enkidu are said to be dedicated to Sin, in this passage referred to as Namra·π£it. According to Andrew R. George this might reflect the belief that he accompanied the dead when not visible in the sky. A poorly preserved passage in the subsequent section of the epic, which deals with Gilgamesh wandering in the wilderness and mourning Enkidu, might describe the hero killing two lions and dedicating them to Sin in a temple dedicated to him, perhaps after being reassured by the moon god in a dream.

Sin is also mentioned on Tablet XII of the standard edition of the epic, an Akkadian adaptation of &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld&quot;, which forms a separate narrative. When Enkidu is imprisoned in the underworld, Gilgamesh begs Sin, Enlil and Ea to help him recover his companion, but the first two of these gods refuse.

An unusual variant of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; replaces the names of the eponymous protagonist and Enkidu with logograms usually used to represent Sin and Ea, d30 and d40. Additionally, Ur is referenced in place of Uruk. The reasons behind this are uncertain, as it is difficult to find similarities between the characters of Sin and Ea and the heroes of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. The only known tablet was copied at some point between the end of the Old Babylonian period and the beginning of the Middle Babylonian period, possibly in the kingdom of Sealand. The surviving passages correspond to the section of the epic dealing with the &quot;civilizing of Enkidu&quot;.

===Other compositions===
The &quot;Lament for Sumer and Ur&quot;, which was inspired by the fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur, describes the impact of a cataclysm which befalls Sin&#x27;s cult center on him. He asks Enlil to reverse the judgment of the divine assembly which resulted in it, but his request is initially denied. He therefore leaves the city alongside Ningal. He eventually approaches Enlil to request help again, this time receiving a guarantee Ur will be rebuilt. Eventually he and Ningal return to the city.

In the &quot;En≈´ma Eli≈°&quot; the moon god, referred to with the name Nannar, is appointed to his position by Marduk after the defeat of Tiamat. However, in a fragmentary &quot;uadi&quot; song, his status is described as bestowed upon him by Ninlil. In another tradition, preserved in a text from the reign of Gungunum, his luminosity was bestowed upon him by the so-called &quot;Enki-Ninki deities&quot;, a class of ancestral beings from various Mesopotamian theogonies. Another fragmentary composition, dated to the Old Babylonian period, describes the marriage of Sin and Ningal, with Enlil presiding over their wedding. The moon god also appears in a fragmentary text seemingly describing visits of the fire god Gibil in various major temples. Additionally, as noted by Nathan Wasserman, various literary fragments which portray Sin as a god who &quot;enjoys river-side fishing&quot; are known.

==Later influence==
Sources postdating the reign of Antigonus I Monophthalmus do not contain much information about the fate of the cult of Sin in Harran, and it remains uncertain how it developed in the last centuries BCE and first two centuries CE, though the official visit of Caracalla in 217 confirms that the city retained a degree of importance. Herodian asserts that this emperor aimed to visit a temple of Selene. However, according to Tamara Green today it is agreed that both this account and Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27; reference to Luna as the deity worshiped in Harran, as well as a number of other Greek, Latin and later Arabic sources asserting that a moon goddess being the central deity of this city, are incorrect. The anonymous author of &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is a notable exception, correctly referring to the deity of Harran as a male figure, &quot;Lunus&quot;.

In Arabic sources the inhabitants of Harran were described as pagan &quot;Sabians&quot; but there are too few reliable accounts of their beliefs to determine to what degree they were a continuation of the cult of Sin known from earlier periods. It has been pointed out that many rituals and deities from late accounts of Harranian religion do not appear to have clear forerunners in earlier sources. Michael Bl√∂mer has suggested that the reports of the survival of &quot;pagan&quot; traditions in Harran might have been exaggerated to disparage the city and contrast it with its political rival, Edessa. Medieval sources assert that the fortress located in Harran was originally a Sabian temple, but it is not known if this claim is rooted in historical truth, and furthermore it cannot be ascertained if this hypothetical house of worship was identical with the ancient temple of Sin. The latter was most likely demolished shortly after the visit of Egeria in the city, dated to 383. Local religious traditions of Harran survived the Muslim conquest of the city in 640 and continued to flourish in the subsequent centuries, until it was destroyed by Mongols in 1260. However, while it is agreed that a part of the local population was neither Christian nor Muslim, according to Bl√∂mer it should be called into question if their practice reflected the ancient worship of Sin in any meaningful capacity. He notes that unreliable testimonies might have been prioritized in their evaluation due to
&quot;the allure of portraying the enigmatic Sabians of medieval ·∏™arrƒÅn as worshippers of S√Æn and the last pagans&quot;. He points out inscriptions from the Byzantine period indicate that churches of multiple Christian denominations existed in the city, and suggests already by the time of the Muslim conquest most of its inhabitants were Christians, much like in Edessa or Amida.

References to Sin are also known from Mandaic literature. In Mandaean cosmology, the name for the moon is &quot;Sin&quot; (), which is derived from the name of the corresponding Mesopotamian deity, much like the Mandean names of many other celestial bodies.

<doc id="85555" wikidata="Q918202" url="?curid=85555" title="Di Penates">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, the Di Penates () or Penates ( ) were among the &quot;dii familiares&quot;, or household deities, invoked most often in domestic rituals. When the family had a meal, they threw a bit into the fire on the hearth for the Penates. They were thus associated with Vesta, the Lares, and the Genius of the &quot;pater familias&quot; in the &quot;little universe&quot; of the &quot;domus&quot;.

Like other domestic deities, the Penates had a public counterpart.

==Function==
An etymological interpretation of the Penates would make them in origin tutelary deities of the storeroom, Latin &quot;penus&quot;, the innermost part of the house, where they guarded the household&#x27;s food, wine, oil, and other supplies. As they were originally associated with the source of food, they eventually became a symbol of the continuing life of the family. Cicero explained that they &quot;dwell inside, from which they are also called &quot;penetrales&quot; by the poets&quot;. The 2nd-century AD grammarian Festus defined &quot;penus&quot;, however, as &quot;the most secret site in the shrine of Vesta, which is surrounded by curtains.&quot; Macrobius reports the theological view of Varro that &quot;those who dig out truth more diligently have said that the Penates are those through whom we breathe in our inner core &quot;(penitus)&quot;, through whom we have a body, through whom we possess a rational mind.&quot;

==Public Penates==
The Penates of Rome (&quot;Penates Publici Populi Romani&quot;) had a temple on the Velia near the Palatine. Dionysius of Halicarnassus says it housed statues of two youths in the archaic style.

The public cult of the ancestral gods of the Roman people originated in Lavinium, where they were also closely linked with Vesta. One tradition identified the public Penates as the sacred objects rescued by Aeneas from Troy and carried by him to Italy. They, or perhaps rival duplicates, were eventually housed in the Temple of Vesta in the Forum. Thus, the Penates, unlike the localized Lares, are portable deities.

Archaeological evidence from Lavinium shows marked influence from Greece in the archaic period, and Aeneas was venerated there as Jupiter Indiges. At the New Year on March 1, Roman magistrates first sacrificed to Capitoline Jupiter at Rome, and then traveled to Lavinium for sacrifices to Jupiter Indiges and Vesta, and a ceremonial visit to the &quot;Trojan&quot; Penates.

<text>Marduk (Cuneiform: ·µàAMAR.UTU; Sumerian: &quot;calf of the sun; solar calf&quot;; ) is a god from ancient Mesopotamia and patron deity of Babylon who eventually rose to power in the 1st millennium BC. In Babylon, Marduk was worshipped in the temple Esagila. His symbol is the spade and he is associated with the Mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u.

By the 1st millennium BC, Marduk had become astrologically associated with the planet Jupiter. He was a prominent figure in Babylonian cosmology, especially in the En≈´ma Eli≈° creation myth.

== Name ==

The name of Marduk was solely spelled as dAMAR.UTU in the Old Babylonian Period, although other spellings such as MES and d≈†A.ZU were also in use since the Kassite Period. In the 1st millennium BC, the ideograms d≈†U and KU were regularly used. The logogram for Adad is also occasionally used to spell Marduk.

Texts from the Old Babylonian period support the pronunciation Marutu or Marutuk, with the shortened spelling Martuk or Marduk attested starting from the Kassite period. His name in Hebrew, Merodak, supports the longer version, and First Millennium Assyrian and Babylonian texts employ the long spelling when the circumstances call for the precise form of the name. The personal name Martuku is not to be confused with the god Marduk. Marduk was commonly called Bƒìl (lord) in the First Millennium BC.

The etymology for the name Marduk is generally understood to be derived from damar-utu-(a)k, meaning &quot;bull-calf of Utu&quot;. Sommerfield suggests this is used to explain the name Marduk in the Enuma Elish: as &quot;He is the &quot;son of the sun&quot; of the gods, radiant is he.&quot;
While the name may suggest a relationship with Shamash, Marduk has no genealogy with the sun god. However, Babylon was closely associated with the city of Sippar in this period, which may have been the reason for the name.

== History ==
=== 3rd millennium BC ===
Marduk, along with the city of Babylon, was unimportant and sparsely attested in the 3rd millennium BC. The earliest mention to Marduk comes from a fragmentary inscription, most likely dating to the Early Dynastic II period. It is left by an unnamed ruler of the city of BAR.KI.BAR (likely Babylon) who constructed a temple for Marduk. A text from the Fara period seems to mention Marduk without the divine determinative, and a fragment of a god list from Abu Salabikh contains dutu-ama[r], likely Marduk written with reversed sign order. A dubious reference to Marduk in the Ur III period comes from the possible personal name ‚ÄúAmar-Sin is the star of Marduk&quot;, although Johandi suggests that the god Martu who appeared together with Enki and Damgalnuna in the Ur III period could possibly refer instead to the similarly named Marduk who is otherwise missing in Ur III documentation, as Martu is later attested to have a different parentage (Anu and Urash) and Marduk is later considered the son of Enki/Ea. If so, this could be evidence that Marduk was already part of the pantheon of Eridu in the Ur III period.

=== Old Babylonian period ===

Under Sumu-la-El, Marduk appeared in oaths and several year names, namely year name 22, which recorded fashioning a throne for Marduk, and year name 24, which recorded making a statue for Zarpanitum. Marduk also started to appear in theophoric names, which would become more frequent in the following decades but would remain rare, appearing in less than 1% of names, although it would grow to 1-2% under Hammurabi. During the reigns of Sabium, Apil-Sin and Sin-muballit, Marduk started to be mentioned outside of the city of Babylon and was invoked alongside local gods in cities subject to the Babylonian kings. Starting from the reign of Hammurabi, sanctuaries to Marduk were found in other cities.

In the Old Babylonian Period, while Marduk is acknowledged to be the ruler of the people, there is no evidence that Hammurabi or his successors promoted Marduk at the expense of other gods. Enlil was still recognized as the highest authority, and Marduk was far from being the pantheon head, instead appearing to be a mediator between the great gods and Hammurabi. This is also expressed in inscriptions from Hammurabi&#x27;s successor Samsu-iluna, expressing that he receives Enlil&#x27;s orders through the other gods, such as Ishtar, Zababa, Shamash and of course Marduk.

A key development during the Old Babylonian period was the association of Marduk with the pantheon of Eridu. Marduk was syncretized with Asalluhi in the later half of the Old Babylonian period, and the opening of the Code of Hammurabi identify Ea as the father of Marduk, a genealogy that would remain canonical. God lists from the Old Babylonian period sometimes place him within the circle of Enki. TCL 15 10 lists Asalluhi and Marduk as separate gods, but close together in the list. Lambert suggests that this may be an intrusion by another scribe, and that the editor scribe did so under the belief that Marduk and Asalluhi were the same god. Johandi on the other hand suggests that Marduk and Asalluhi were not seen as the same god, but were viewed to be related to one another. The Nippur God List also lists Asalluhi and Marduk separately, with Marduk appearing seventy names before Asalluhi. In the Weidner god list, however, it appears that Marduk and Asalluhi were viewed as the same god.

According to the Marduk prophecy and inscriptions of Agum II, the statue of Marduk and Zarpanitum were removed from Babylon by Mursili I during his raid on Babylon (middle chronology 1595 BC), which was returned during the reign of Agum II.

=== Middle Babylonian period ===

In the Kassite period, theophoric names containing Marduk grew to over 10%, and the local temple to Marduk in Nippur was firmly integrated and well established. The Kassite kings sometimes gave Marduk pompous epithets, showing Marduk&#x27;s growing popularity, however Enlil still ranks as the most important Mesopotamian god, still heading the list along with Anu and Ea. At least five Kassite kings bore theophoric names containing Enlil, and Kassite kings, especially Nazi-Maruttash and Kudur-Enlil, are known to have visited Nippur at the beginning of the year. Kurigalzu calls himself the &quot;regent of Enlil&quot; and Dur-Kurigalzu&#x27;s temple complex holds temples to Enlil, Ninlil and Ninurta.

There are two administrative documents from Nippur from the reigns of two Kassite kings, perhaps Nazi-Maruttash and Shagarakti-Shuriash, that mention the celebration of the akitu festival connected to Marduk. Another text claims the late Kassite king Adad-shuma-usur embarked on a pilgrimage from Babylon to Borsippa and Kutha, Marduk, Nabu and Nergal respectively. However, there are reasons to doubt the historicity of these texts, especially the alleged journey of Adad-shuma-usur since the trio of Marduk, Nabu and Nergal fit the ideology of the 1st millennium BC. Nonetheless, the texts could be evidence that the rise of Marduk was a gradual process that began before Nebuchadnezzar I. Similarly, in the god list An = Anum the number 50, Enlil&#x27;s number, was assigned to Marduk instead.

A private document dating to the reign of Ashur-uballit I in Assyria refers to a sanctuary of Marduk in the city of Assur. A gate of Marduk was also attested in Assur in the 13th Century. Similar to the Neo-Assyrian period, Marduk was mentioned to receive offerings and gifts in Assur. In the Coronation text of Tukulti-Ninurta, Marduk even received the same amount of offerings as Ashur. The statue of Marduk was carried off by Tukulti-Ninurta I to Assyria, where it would stay until it was returned. The cult of Marduk in Assyria would remain attested in the Neo-Assyrian period.

Marduk was found in Ugarit in an Akkadian hymn that may have been part of the scribal school curriculum.

During the Kassite period, Nabu, previously the scribe of Marduk, came to be viewed as Marduk&#x27;s son.

=== Second dynasty of Isin ===
By the time of the Isin II dynasty, an established syncretism of Babylon and Nippur (and by extension Marduk and Enlil) was in place. The names of the city walls were switched, with Imgur-Enlil and Nimit-Enlil in Babylon while Imgur-Marduk and Nimit-Marduk were in Nippur. A first millennium bilingual hymn to Nippur links Babylon and Nippur together:

Nippur is the city of Enlil, Babylon is his favorite.
Nippur and Babylon, their meaning is the same.

The ideology of the supremacy of Marduk is generally viewed to have been promoted by Nebuchadnezzar I and his successors. Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s second campaign into Elam and the return of the statue of Marduk that was carried off to Elam by either Shutruk-Nahhunte or his son Kutir-Nahhunte in 1155 BC is thought to be the trigger. However, there are chronological problems regarding the abduction of the statue by the Elamites, as the statue of Marduk abducted by Tukulti-Ninurta I wasn&#x27;t returned yet by the Assyrians before the Elamites sacked Babylon in 1155 BC. Johnson suggests that Tukulti-Ninurta could have taken a different statue of Marduk while the main cult statue was taken by Kuter-Nahhunte, while B√°nyai believes that immediately following the return of the statue of Marduk by Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur a second invasion by Kuter-Nahhunte carried off the same statue.

Nonetheless, beginning from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, acknowledgement of Marduk&#x27;s supremacy over other gods was now the norm. A kudurru dating to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar claims that Marduk, now the &quot;king of the gods&quot; directly dispatched Nebuchadnezzar and gave him weapons, and in the Epic of Nebuchadnezzar, it is Marduk who commanded the gods to abandon Babylonia. A kudurru from the reign of Enlil-nadin-apli calls Marduk the &quot;king of the gods, the lord of the lands,&quot; a title that Enlil traditionally held. Likewise, when Simbar-shipak, the first king of the Second Dynasty of Sealand, made Enlil a replacement throne for the one made by Nebuchadnezzar, in his mind this was actually dedicated to Marduk. Other texts, such as Akkadian prayers and incantations also call Marduk the king of the gods.

=== 1st millennium BC ===
The earliest copy of the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian epic of creation, was found in the city of Assur and dated to the 9th century, although the text could go back to the Isin II period. Dalley believes that the Enuma Elish may have been composed during the Old Babylonian Period, although other scholars consider it unlikely. The Enuma Elish describes Marduk&#x27;s ascendance to kingship by defeating Tiamat. In the end, Marduk is proclaimed the ruler, declares Babylon as the city of kingship, received his fifty names (fifty being the number of Enlil), while Enlil is ignored.

In Assyrian sources, most of the mentions of Marduk&#x27;s power and authority came from the reigns of the Sargonids. Generally, the Neo-Assyrian kings cared for Babylon and the cult of Marduk. Shalmaneser III visited multiple Babylonian sanctuaries, including that of Marduk. Tiglath-pileser III, after conquering Babylonia, participated in the Akitu festival in Babylon, and Sargon II made Babylon his temporary residence while Dur-Sharrukin was under construction and took part in the Akitu. Marduk frequently appears in Assyrian royal inscriptions, before the Assyrian kings even gained control over Babylonia. In continuation from the Middle Assyrian times, an actual cult of Marduk seemed to have also existed in the Neo-Assyrian period. The Assyrian Divine Directory mentioned that a shrine to Marduk existed in the temple of Gula in Ashur in the Neo-Assyrian period. Marduk and his son Nabu also shared a sanctuary in Nineveh, although it seemed that Nabu was the main deity in contrast to Marduk.

One exception was Sennacherib, who after a series of revolts and the extradition of the crown prince Assur-nadin-shumi to the Elamites (who then probably killed him), decided to destroy Babylon. The Destruction of Babylon in 689 BCE was, judging from Sennacherib&#x27;s own accounts, bad by Neo-Assyrian standards. Outside of claiming to have destroyed the temples and the cult statues, there was no explicit mention of the fate of Marduk&#x27;s statue, although Esarhaddon would later claim that the cult statue was taken from Babylon. Sennacherib followed with what has been called a religious reform, the infrastructure of Assur being refashioned in the model of Babylon&#x27;s, and the Assyrian edition of the Enuma Elish replaced Marduk with the god Ashur (spelled as Anshar) and Babylon with Assur (spelled as Baltil). Other texts referencing Marduk were also adapted and changed to fit Ashur instead, and a bed and throne dedicated to Marduk were rededicated to Ashur after the furniture was brought from Babylon to Assur. The Marduk Ordeal contained cultic commentaries on the Akitu festival reinterpreted to refer to instead Marduk‚Äôs punishment. However, the more radical reforms were reversed under the reign of his successor Esarhaddon, who also oversaw the reconstruction of Babylon and the eventual return of the statue of Marduk under ≈†ama≈°-≈°uma-ukin. Esarhaddon also crafted a narrative justifying both Sennacherib&#x27;s destruction and his rebuilding by citing Marduk&#x27;s divine anger as the cause for Babylon&#x27;s destruction, who originally decreed for the city to be abandoned for seventy years, but Marduk relented and allowed Esarhaddon to rebuild it.

Nabonassar claimed that Marduk proclaimed him lordship and had ordered him to &quot;plunder his enemy&#x27;s land&quot; (referring to Assyria), who only ruled Babylonia due to divine anger. He claimed that he killed the Assyrian and laid waste to his lands by the command of Marduk and Nabu and with the weapons of Erra, which was the main trio of the First Millennium Babylonian ideology. In literary texts from the Achaemenid and Seleucid eras, Marduk is said to have commissioned Nabonassar to take revenge on the land of Akkad (Babylonia).

In royal inscriptions of the Neo-Babylonian kings, Marduk is exalted as the king of the gods and as the source of their authority, while Enlil is hardly ever mentioned except when in relation to the city of Nippur. In a Late Babylonian god list, all the gods on the list were identified with Marduk. For example, Ninurta was Marduk of the pickaxe, Nabu was Marduk of accounting, Shamash was Marduk of justice and Tishpak was Marduk of the troops. This &quot;syncretistic tendency&quot; is observed in other late texts, where the other gods appear as aspects of Marduk.

Cyrus, justifying his conquest of Babylonia, claimed that Marduk had abandoned Nabonidus who offended Marduk by turning his back on the Esagila in the Cyrus Cylinder. Another anti-Nabonidus text, the Verse Account, explains that Nabonidus favoured Sin over Marduk. Nabonidus‚Äô reverence for the moon god may have been because of familial roots to the city of Harran, and later he even revived the religious institutions of Ur, the main sanctuary of Sin.

== Characteristics ==
=== Symbol ===
His symbol is the spade and he is associated with the Mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u, a dragon-like creature from Mesopotamian mythology.

=== Original role ===
Since sources pertaining to Marduk in the early periods are sparse, Marduk&#x27;s original role is unknown. However, since Marduk appeared in the Abu Salabikh list behind three minor deities whose names point to a possible connection with the underworld, Johandi suggests that Marduk may have been a minor god connected to the underworld. Similarly, Oshima recently proposed that Marduk may have originally had a role similar to Nergal, which may even explain why the logogram dAMAR.UTU is used in Hittite texts to write the name of the god ≈†anta, who was similar in nature to Nergal. In the earlier forerunners to the Udug Hul where both Marduk and Asalluhi appear together in a passage Marduk, in contrast to Asalluhi, does not help the victim but instead captures him, either because of his powerlessness or because he simply refused to help. Oshima interpreted the passage as supporting the idea that Marduk&#x27;s original role was illness and death. Similarly, in Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina, Asalluhi (here identified with Marduk) imposing an evil spell on Sin-iddinam (the king of Larsa) causing him to become sick may reflect that Marduk&#x27;s power to cause illness extended beyond the dominion of Babylon. However Sommerfield, who previously believed that there was little evidence for Marduk being related to magic, more recently suggested that Marduk was originally a god of incantations before his syncretism with Asalluhi. Jacobsen suggests that Marduk was originally a storm god due to the storm imageries in the Enuma Elish, wielding the four winds and storms as weapons, and assigning to himself the rain and clouds that came from Tiamat&#x27;s corpse. Abusch, citing Jacobsen, also believes that Marduk was a storm god, and may have been associated with water and vegetation before joining the pantheon of Eridu as it is improbable to suppose that all of Marduk&#x27;s traits with water as being taken from the circle of Enki. However, there is no other evidence suggesting that Marduk was originally a local storm god, and the usage of wind and storm as weapons are not limited to storm gods. Schwemer points to Ninurta (who is not a storm god) as the original model for Marduk using storms, winds and floods as weapons. Schwemer also summarizes that although Marduk has characteristics that overlap with the storm god profile, it does not mean that Marduk or other gods in similar position (such as Ninurta, Martu, Telepinu and Tishpak) are necessarily storm gods. Marduk&#x27;s symbol, the spade, may point to him originally being a god of agriculture, or more likely as a god of canals and by extension fertility. Unlike Abusch, Oshima believes that Marduk&#x27;s association with water came from his association with canals. He is depicted as the supplier of water in Prayer to Marduk no.2, dating to the Kassite period, and was praised as the bringer of water from rivers, seasonal floods and rains to the fields. Various prayers to Marduk refer to his connection with springs and rivers, and Ashurbanipal applies the epithet &quot;the canal inspector of the heavens and the earth&quot; to Marduk.

=== Marduk&#x27;s anger and mercy ===
Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina shares similar motifs with the Prayer to Marduk no.1 and Ludlul bel nemeqi, where Marduk&#x27;s anger is blamed for some certain ailment affecting the sufferer, and can only be remedied by Marduk having mercy and forgiving them. In the Prayer to Marduk no.1, Marduk is asked to not kill his client, and in Ludlul Marduk is praised for his mercy after forgiving his client. As such, some scholars claim that Marduk was being praised for his wrath, and others claim that Marduk comes off as having &quot;unpredictable mood swings.&quot; Lambert also points to one of Marduk&#x27;s names in the Enuma Elish, Mer≈°aku≈°u (&quot;savage, yet relenting&quot;), suggests that the Babylonians may have stressed Marduk&#x27;s mercy so he could be less savage, although Oshima proposes that the Babylonians had to stress both his wrath and mercy to appease him. Others believe that the purpose of the poem was to stress that Marduk&#x27;s true inner quality was mercy and benevolence. The Prayer to Marduk no.2, on the other hand, praises Marduk&#x27;s power to heal, which may have been as a result of syncretism with Asalluhi.

=== Connections to the River Ordeal ===
Due to being the son of Ea, Marduk had connections with the River Ordeal. Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina also identified Idlurugu (the river ordeal) as the father of Marduk/Asalluhi, in contrast to the standard genealogy.

=== Incantations ===
Marduk features in incantations of the Marduk-Ea type formula, in which the god Ea/Enki engages in dialogue with his son Marduk/Asalluhi. The structure of the formula starts with Marduk/Asalluhi noticing a problem and reporting to his father. Ea reassures his son about his knowledge and then proceeds to instruct his son on the procedures. In later incantations from the First Millenium BC, the priests usually claim to be direct representations of Marduk/Asalluhi, replacing the divine dialogue between father and son, for example in Marduk&#x27;s Address to the Demons the priest starts by declaring themselves to be Marduk. In Neo-Assyrian Assyria, Marduk was one of the major gods that incantation-prayers were directed at, with only Shamash being invoked more than Marduk.
It is difficult to tell if Marduk originally had a role in incantations prior to being identified with Asalluhi. Marduk sometimes appears in the Sumerian-Akkadian bilinguals as the Akkadian name for Asalluhi, although Marduk and Asalluhi were also attested to appear separately in two different texts, one being the incantation against the evil Udug where Marduk captured the victim instead of helping in contrast to Asalluhi who sought out Enki, the other being an incantation against Lamashtu that listed Marduk and Asalluhi separately as deterrence to the demon.

== Myths and literature ==

=== Enuma Elish ===
The Enuma Elish, generally believed to have been composed in the Isin II period, details Marduk&#x27;s rise to power as the king of the gods. There are similarities between the Epic of Creation and the Anzu myth as well as other traditions related to Ninurta. The Tablet of Destinies is a key object in both myths, and Marduk uses largely the same weapons as Ninurta. A ritual tablet mentions how the Epic of Creation would be recited and possibly reenacted during the Akitu festival, on the fourth day of the month of Nisannu. The epic starts off by mentioning Apsu and Tiamat, here the oldest gods, and created a younger generation of the gods. However, Apsu was disturbed by their noisiness and decided to kill them. Ea, however, found out about the plot and kills Apsu and takes his splendour. Later Marduk was born to Ea and Damkina, and already at birth he was special. Tiamat then decides to wage war against the younger generation of the gods, giving Kingu the Tablet of Destinies and appointing him as the commander. Marduk volunteers to do battle against Tiamat and defeats her. The world was fashioned from Tiamat&#x27;s corpse with Babylon as the center, and Marduk assumes kingship and receives his fifty names. 
The fifty names taken was based on the An = Anum god list, the columnar arrangement removed and slotted in.
One of his titles, bƒìl mƒÅtƒÅti (king of the lands) originally belonged to Enlil, who was conspicuously missing from the epic except when he gave this title to Marduk

=== Ludlul bel nemeqi ===
Also known as the &quot;Babylonian Job,&quot; the poem describes the narrator&#x27;s suffering caused by Marduk&#x27;s anger, causing him to lose his job and to experience hostility from his friends and family. Diviners were incapable of helping him and his personal protective spirits and gods also did not come to help. He claims that nobody understood the actions of the gods, and despite the narrator&#x27;s protests of innocence and that he had always been pious to the gods and never abandoned him, he quickly became ill and was on death&#x27;s bed. Then, in a series of dreams, he met a young man, an incantation priest that purified him, a young woman with a godlike appearance who came to say that his suffering had ended, and an incantation priest from Babylon. Afterwards, the narrator praises Marduk&#x27;s mercy which was the main point of the text despite the expressions of Marduk&#x27;s anger.

=== Epic of Erra ===

In the Erra epic, Erra convinced Marduk to leave Esagil and to go to the netherworld, leaving Erra to become king. Afterwards, Erra wreaks havoc on all the cities and causes instability. Marduk came back and lamented the state of Babylon. Unlike the Enuma Elish which championed Marduk as the bringer of peace and stability, Marduk is here the one who brought instability by leaving his seat, thus bringing darkness upon the world. He also indirectly brought war by yielding to Erra.

=== Marduk Ordeal ===

Written in the Assyrian dialect, versions of the so-called Marduk Ordeal Text are known from Assur, Nimrud and Nineveh. Using sceneries and language familiar to the procession of the Akitu Festival, here Marduk is instead being held responsible for crimes committed against Ashur and was subject to a river ordeal and imprisonment. The text opens with Nabu arriving in Babylon looking for Marduk, his father. Tashmetum prayed to Sin and Shamash. Meanwhile, Marduk was being held captive, the color red on his clothes was reinterpreted to be his blood, and the case was brought forward to the god Ashur. The city of Babylon also seemingly rebelled against Marduk, and Nabu learned that Marduk was taken to the river ordeal. Marduk claims that everything was done for the good of the god Ashur and prays to the gods to let him live. After various alternate cultic commentaries, the Assyrian version of the Enuma Elish was recited, proclaiming Ashur&#x27;s superiority. However, despite the content, the Marduk Ordeal was not simply an anti-Marduk piece of literature. At no point was Marduk actually accused of a crime, and the end of the text seems to suggest that the gods fought to get Marduk out by drilling holes through the door which he is locked behind. Marduk also appeared in the curse section, so it is possible that the majority of the blame was put on the Babylonians for leading Marduk astray, while Marduk retains a position within the pantheon. While most attribute this text to Sennacherib&#x27;s destruction of Babylon, Frymer-Kensky suggests that the background could be the return of Marduk&#x27;s statue to Babylon in 669 BCE.

=== Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat ===

Known from only one copy and with a badly damaged top half, Enmesharra&#x27;s Defeat is likely composed in the Seleucid or Parthian era. Structurally similar to the Enuma Elish, the text starts with Enmesharra and his seven sons going against Marduk, who subsequently defeated them and threw them into jail with Nergal as the prison warden. The preserved portion starts with Nergal announcing Marduk&#x27;s judgement to Enmesharra that he and his sons would all be put to death, and Enmesharra laments about Marduk&#x27;s terrible judgement and pleads with Nergal. Nergal replies, but the text breaks off. Nergal is then shown to be escorting Enmesharra and his sons to Marduk, who first beheads the sons, and Enmesharra&#x27;s radiance was then taken and given to Shamash. Nabu was also given the power of Ninurta, Nergal those of Erra, and Marduk took Enlil&#x27;s power. Marduk, Nabu and Nergal then shared the throne, which likely previously belonged to Anu, together. The gods were then assigned their cities, and a voice from heaven could be heard. A fish-goat praised Marduk as the exalted lord, and the text ends with the gods gathering at Babylon.

== Syncretisms ==

=== Asalluhi ===
The earliest evidence of Asalluhi&#x27;s syncretism with Marduk is Sin-iddinam&#x27;s prayer to Ninisina, where Asalluhi was called the &quot;king of Babylon.&quot; An Old Babylonian text substitutes &quot;son of Eridu&quot; for &quot;lord of Tintir&quot; as a title for Asalluhi (Tintir being another attested name for Babylon.) In Hammurabi&#x27;s prayer to Asalluhi, he is clearly viewed as synonymous with Marduk. However, in a prayer for Samsu-iluna, Marduk and Asalluhi were mentioned as separate gods, suggesting that the syncretism Marduk = Asalluhi was not yet fully established as canonical in the Old Babylonian period. Johandi also suggests that keeping Marduk and Asalluhi separate was a deliberate act on the part of Samsu-iluna to reclaim authority over the southern cities, which were centers of rebellion during the early years of his reign.

Sommerfield suggested that the syncretism of may have been due to both having a similar role as a god of incantations, or because Asalluhi was more well known in Southern Babylonia compared to Marduk, who was still a local god. Lambert also believes the syncretism to be a means to elevate Marduk to a more respectable position. Johandi proposes that Marduk and Asalluhi were identified for some other reason other than magic, and Marduk only became a god associated with magic after being syncretized with Asalluhi.

=== Enlil ===

The syncretism of Babylon and Nippur was in place from the Isin II period, and the names of the city walls were switched, with Imgur-Enlil and Nimit-Enlil in Babylon while Imgur-Marduk and Nimit-Marduk were in Nippur. By extension, Marduk was also identified with Enlil, and in the Isin II period Marduk was attested with Enlil&#x27;s titles. Marduk was often called the &quot;Enlil of the gods&quot; in the First Millennium.

A statue of Marduk, conveniently named &quot;King of the gods of Heaven and the Underworld&quot; was placed in Enlil&#x27;s sanctuary in Babylon, and Marduk receives the title bƒìl mƒÅtƒÅti &quot;king of the lands&quot; in the Enuma Elish.

=== Tutu ===

The previous patron deity of Borsippa. Although Hammurabi recognized Tutu&#x27;s dominion as extending over Borsippa and E-zida, Tutu became another name for Marduk after Hammurabi, but became a byname for Nabu in the First Millennium. Tutu was also a name for Marduk in the Enuma Elish. In the bird call text, the bird of Enmesharra calls that he sinned against Tutu, here meaning Marduk.

<text>The Rolls of Ol√©ron (French: &quot;Jugements de la mer, R√¥les d&#x27;Ol√©ron&quot;) are the oldest and best-known sea law regulating medieval shipping in North-western Europe. The Rolls of Oleron were the first common sea law written in the Isle of Ol√©ron, France, in the late 12th century, prior to 1180, later evolving to encompass Northern Europe. Any later sea laws written in Northern Europe are largely based on or inspired by the R√¥les d&#x27;Ol√©ron.

==Origin==
The Rolls of Oleron originally regulated the wine trade from Brittany and Normandy to England, Scotland and Flanders but were widely disseminated in the later Middle Ages and became an important sea law.

===Different sources of origin===
There is some disagreement among historians as to how and when the Rolls of Ol√©ron came into existence. One of the oldest beliefs is that Eleanor of Aquitaine had the laws written down around 1160 when she returned from the Holy Land. Another theory is that her son, Richard I, had them written down after his own return from the Holy Land towards the end of the 12th century, but that is highly unlikely. There is no sign in the Rolls that someone as important as a king or queen had anything to do with its creation.

Some recent historians have argued that the Rolls were written in the 13th century, between 1224 and 1286. 

==Etymology==
The Rolls of Oleron are named after the Isle of Ol√©ron for an unclear reason. One theory is that one of the manuscripts was copied from an exemplar of the ‚ÄòJugements de la mer‚Äô&#x27; that was kept on the island and that the name stuck.

The Rolls of Oleron are known by a variety of names, which include the &quot;Rules of Ol√©ron‚Äù, the &quot;Law of Ol√©ron&quot;, the &quot;Charter of Ol√©ron of the Judgments of the Sea&quot; and the &quot;Judgements of Ol√©ron&quot;. Its Flemish translation became known as the ‚ÄúVonnesse van Damme‚Äù.

==Structure and content==
The original text of the Rolls of Oleron contained 24 articles, but because some articles were subsequently omitted, divided or combined in the various copies, surviving texts sometimes include a different number of judgements. 
Each article regulates aspects of sea shipping, such as the payment of freightage in case of shipwreck, the reimbursement of damages, and the securement of both the ship and the cargo.

==Distribution and common usage==
In France, the Rolls of Oleron had been adopted as the official sea law by 1364.

The document was originally written in French and later translated into Spanish, Scots and Flemish/Dutch. It is likely that the Scots translation is based on the French version because of similarities. It does not appear that the court in Aberdeen used the translated version in its legal practice.

The Flemish/Dutch translation is known as the Vonesse van Damme. The oldest extant copies of the Rolls are in the Little Red Book of Bristol and the Liber Horn. In the second half of the 14th century, the Ordinancie appeared as a new sea law in the Zuiderzee area in the Netherlands. In most manuscripts, that law was combined with the Vonesse van Damme. Some historians have argued that the Ordinancie was written as a supplement to the Rolls, but that is not likely because two laws in the Ordinancie were copied directly from the Rolls, and the rest regulates approximately the same subjects as the Rolls.

The Rolls of Oleron had been officially adopted in England by the reign of King Edward III: in 1351, a Bristol inquest confirmed that the rolls had statute of law. Most shipment of wine was done with English ships and crew. Therefore, the crew needed to know the rules. According to Albrecht Cordes, in the 14th century, the influence of the Rolls of Oleron extended to Spain and, most importantly, to Flanders, where they were translated into Flemish. However, the Rolls of Oleron were integrated in the Navarrese charter of San Sebasti√°n in 1180, which summarized practices already used along the coast of the Cantabrian Sea (Gulf of Biscay) and overall the European Atlantic coast. The Rolls of Oleron were relatively short compared to other contemporary sea laws and, as such, can be considered to have been among the easiest to use.

Sometimes known as the &quot;Lawes of Pleron,&quot; they also formed the basis of similar agreements among 17th and 18th century privateers and pirates, known as Articles.

==Today==
The Rolls of Oleron were included in the &quot;Black Book of the Admiralty&quot; in 1336, but the original book disappeared from the registry of the High Court of Admiralty at the beginning of the 19th century. Only a few manuscript copies of parts of this book, some dating to about 1420, are extant and kept in the British Library and the Bodleian Library. The laws are still occasionally cited as authority by U.S. courts.

<text>Adelard of Bath (; 1080? 1142‚Äì1152?) was a 12th-century English natural philosopher. He is known both for his original works and for translating many important Greek scientific works of astrology, astronomy, philosophy, alchemy and mathematics into Latin from Arabic versions, which were then introduced to Western Europe. The oldest surviving Latin translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; is a 12th-century translation by Adelard from an Arabic version. He is known as one of the first to introduce the Arabic numeral system to Europe. He stands at the convergence of three intellectual schools: the traditional learning of French schools, the Greek culture of Southern Italy, and the Arabic science of the East.

== Background ==
Adelard&#x27;s biography was incomplete in places, and leaves some aspects open to interpretation. Consequently, much of what is ascribed to Adelard is a product of his own testimony.

Adelard claims to come from the Roman English city of Bath. How he lived is not entirely known. Despite his extensive travels, by the end of his life he is thought to have returned to Bath where he died around 1160 CE.

The parents of the philosopher are not known for sure, but Fastred, a tenant of the Bishop of Wells, is noted by scholars as a possible father. The name Adelard is of Anglo-Saxon origin, which would make him to be of low status in 11th-century England. It is believed that he left England toward the end of the 11th century for Tours, likely on the advice of Bishop John de Villula, who had moved the seat of his bishopric from Wells to Bath in 1090. During his studies in Tours, an anonymous &quot;wise man of Tours&quot; inspired Adelard with his interest in astronomy to study the science. Adelard later taught for a time at Laon, leaving no later than 1109 for travel.

After leaving Laon, Adelard describes himself as travelling to Southern Italy and Sicily no later than 1116. Adelard also reports extensive travel throughout the &quot;lands of the Crusades&quot;: Greece, West Asia, Sicily, possibly Spain, Tarsus, Antioch, and potentially Palestine. Historians believe that Adelard learned Arabic in Sicily or in Spain during his travels. The time spent in these areas would help explain his fascination with mathematics and his access to Arabic scholars. His travels are contested by scholars, some of whom speculate that he used references to &quot;travel&quot; and claims of discourse with &quot;Arabs&quot; as a cover for original ideas.

By 1126, Adelard returned to the West with the intention of spreading the knowledge he had gained about Arab astronomy and geometry to the Latin world. This time of remarkable transition and crusade marked an opportunity for someone to gain valuable influence over the evolution of human history. While the Crusades offered little in the way of a victor, Adelard&#x27;s non-discriminatory scholarly work inspired him to bring back to England many ancient texts and new questions that would later give rise to an English Renaissance. During Adelard&#x27;s lifetime in the 11th century it was understandably difficult for him to have achieved his educational pursuits. As printing had not been introduced and the literacy rate was very low, books were rare in medieval Europe, usually held only by royal courts or Catholic monastic communities (Kraye, &quot;et al.&quot; 1987). Fittingly, Adelard studied with monks at the Benedictine Monastery at Bath Cathedral.

== Main works ==

Among Adelard of Bath&#x27;s original works is a trio of dialogues, written to mimic the Platonic style, or correspondences with his nephew. The earliest of these is &quot;De Eodem et Diverso (On the Same and the Different)&quot;. It is written in the style of a protreptic, or an exhortation to the study of philosophy. The work is modelled on Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, evident in Adelard&#x27;s vocabulary and phraseology. It is believed to have been written near Tours after he had already travelled, though there is no indication that he had travelled past Southern Italy and Sicily at the time of writing. The work takes the form of a dramatic dialogue between Philocosmia, who advocates worldly pleasures, and Philosophia, whose defence of scholarship leads into a summary of the seven liberal arts. Underlining the entire work is the contrast between Philocosmia&#x27;s &quot;res&quot; (perceptible reality), and Philosophia&#x27;s &quot;verba&quot; (mental concepts). Each section of the liberal arts is divided into two parts. Presented first is a description of the allegorical figure representing the art, in which the importance of that art is indicated, followed by a summary of the doctrines of that art, as told by the allegorical figure who is presented as the founder or main proponent of the particular art.

The second of this trio, and arguably Adelard&#x27;s most significant contribution, was his &quot;Questiones Naturales&quot; or &quot;Questions on Natural Science&quot;. It can be dated between 1107 and 1133 as, in the text, Adelard himself mentions that seven years have passed since his lecturing in schools at Laon. He chooses to present this work as a forum for Arabic learning, referring often to his experiences in Antioch. He sets out seventy-six questions, in the form of a Platonic dialogue about meteorology and natural science. It was used heavily in schools into and beyond the 13th century but the teaching on natural things would ultimately be superseded by Aristotle&#x27;s writing. The text is broken up into three parts: &quot;On Plants and Brute Animals&quot;, &quot;On Man&quot; and &quot;On Earth, Water, Air, and Fire&quot;. Two of the more specific features associated with this text are (1) a preference for reason over authority in matters of science and nature (in other words, seeking solutions via reason and logic rather than through faith) and (2) the use of the literary device of invoking Arab teachings when presenting very controversial topics (e.g. that brute animals may possess knowledge and souls) Adelard didn&#x27;t think that the use of reason to seek knowledge was in any way contradictory with Christian faith in God. The soul is a large part of the dialogue in this text as &quot;On Man&quot; discusses a corporeal soul in man, while the final section elaborates on the incorporeal soul of elements and animals. &quot;Questiones Naturales&quot; appears to have been an immediate success as it was copied on both sides of the English Channel and was even presented in a &quot;pocket-book&quot; format, suggesting that it was meant to be carried around.

The final section in his trilogy is a treatise on hawking called &quot;De Avibus Tractatus (Treatise on Birds)&quot;. It is a medical text that addresses disease from head-to-toe. While it has been argued that this treatise was not widely distributed, an investigation of later Latin and French treatises reveals a number of excerpts from Adelard&#x27;s work.

The remainder of Adelard&#x27;s original works did not involve the persona of his nephew. He wrote a treatise on the use of the abacus called &quot;Regulae Abaci&quot;, which was likely written very early in his career because it shows no trace of Arab influence. This treatise is believed to be proof that Adelard was connected to the Exchequer table that was used for monetary calculations in the medieval period. If you read the source quoted, its obvious Adelard of Bath probably knew who worked at the Exchequer and might have met them at Laon, but what is common among them is that their educations are in Laon! Further evidence for this can be found in the Pipe Roll of Henry I, which shows that he had received a discharge from the &quot;murder fine&quot; (a fine levied on all inhabitants of a certain area based on the murder of a Norman that occurred in a generally accessible field in the area) levied on the community of Wiltshire in 1130, though there is no other proof for this fact. There is debate about whether the Adelard who lived in Bath and who was levied with this charge really is the same Adelard of Bath, considering Adelard is a common name. The work that Adelard of Bath is known for in the Latin world is his translation of the astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi, the first widely accessible Latin translation of the Islamic ideas about algebra. In the Middle Ages he was known for his rediscovery and teaching of geometry, earning his reputation when he made the first full translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and began the process of interpreting the text for a Western audience.

== Influence ==
Adelard&#x27;s work impacted the course of natural philosophy, notably influencing Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. His work in natural philosophy helped lay the foundations for much of the progress that was made in the later centuries after Aristotle. His work surrounding Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; provided training in demonstrative and geometrical proofs. While his original writings demonstrate a sincere passion for the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, geometry, music, and astronomy), his work in &quot;Quaestiones naturales&quot; illustrated a more encompassing dedication to subjects such as physics, the natural sciences, and metaphysics.

His influence is evident in &quot;De philosophia mundi&quot; by William of Conches, in the work of Hugh of Saint Victor, in Isaac of Stella&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Alcher on the Soul&quot; and in Peter Abelard&#x27;s &quot;Hexaemeron&quot;.

He introduced algebra to the Latin world and his commentaries in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; were extremely influential in the 13th century. Adelard was also responsible for introducing Arabic numerals, including the symbol for zero, to Western Europe. Adelard displayed original thought of a scientific bent, questioning the shape of the Earth (he believed it was round) and asking how it remains stationary in space. He developed the classic physics question of how far a rock would fall if a hole were drilled through the Earth and a rock dropped through it (see center of gravity). He later supplemented his mathematical translations with &quot;De opere astrolapsus,&quot; a text explaining the use of an astrolabe.

Campanus of Novara probably had access to Adelard&#x27;s translation of &quot;Elements&quot;, and it is Campanus&#x27; edition that was first published in Venice in 1482 after the invention of the printing press. It became the chief textbook of the mathematical schools of Western Europe until the 16th century.

<text>The Isle of Ol√©ron or Ol√©ron Island (, ; Saintongese: &quot;il√¢te d&#x27;Olerun&quot;; , ) is an island off the Atlantic coast of France (due west of Rochefort), on the southern side of the Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche strait.

It is the second largest island of Metropolitan France, after Corsica, with a length of and a width of . It has an area of 174¬†km (67 sq. mi.) and more than 21,000 permanent inhabitants.

==History==
Oleron has been known since the 1st century, where Pliny the Elder refers to it in his Natural History as Uliaros (&quot;&quot;in aquitanico sinu Vliaros&quot;)&quot;.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, the Roman emperor Probus extended the privilege of owning vineyards and producing wine to all Gauls, and this led to a culture of winemaking developing on the island. This lasted until the end of the 19th century, when the arrival of phylloxera decimated almost all the vines. The vineyards did not recover, and grape production today is mainly for Cognac &quot;bois ordinaires&quot;.

In the 7th and 8th century, the island, along with R√©, formed the &quot;Vacetae Insulae&quot; or Vacetian Islands, according to the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;. Vaceti was another name for the Vascones, the reference is seen evidence of Basque (Gascon) control of the islands by that time.

It was at Ol√©ron in about 1152 to 1160 that Eleanor of Aquitaine introduced the first &#x27;maritime&#x27; or &#x27;admiralty&#x27; laws in that part of the world: the Rolls of Ol√©ron. In 1306, Edward I of England granted the island to his son, Edward II, as part of the Duchy of Aquitaine.

In 1793, during the French Revolution, the villages of the isle of Ol√©ron were renamed. The Ch√¢teau d&#x27;Ol√©ron became &quot;Equality&quot;, Saint-Trojan became &quot;La Montagne&quot;, Dolus became &quot;Sans-Culotte&quot;, Saint-Pierre became &quot;La Fraternit√©&quot; and Saint-Georges became &quot;L&#x27;Unit√©&quot;. The overall territory of Oleron became the island of Liberty. A few years later, the original names were given back to the villages and towns.

During the Second World War, the island was occupied by German forces and fortified. It was liberated by Free French Forces in an amphibious assault code-named Operation Jupiter on 29 April 1945. The French cruiser &quot;Duquesne&quot; fired 550 heavy shells at the German artillery batteries, and the garrison surrendered on the following day.

The isle of Ol√©ron is known today for the quality of its oyster production.

==Geography and climate==

The island has an area of about . It is a fertile and well cultivated island on the Atlantic coast of France, that is on the Bay of Biscay.

The climate is generally mild (maritime temperate) with sufficient but not excessive rainfall, but with probably from 3 to 15 days of intense heat in the summer months of July and August, mostly grouped.

Oleron is located in the heart of the sunniest area of the French Atlantic coast. The island benefits from more than 2100 hours per year.

==Administration==
Administratively, the island belongs to the Charente-Maritime &quot;d√©partement&quot;, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine &quot;r√©gion&quot;. The island is divided into 8 communes:
* La Br√©e-les-Bains
* Le Ch√¢teau-d&#x27;Ol√©ron
* Dolus-d&#x27;Ol√©ron
* Le Grand-Village-Plage
* Saint-Denis-d&#x27;Ol√©ron
* Saint-Georges-d&#x27;Ol√©ron (includes Boyardville)
* Saint-Pierre d&#x27;Ol√©ron
* Saint-Trojan-les-Bains

The island has about 22,000 inhabitants.

==Transportation==

Since 1966, the island has been connected to the mainland by a road bridge. With a length of between abutments, it was the longest bridge in France at the time of construction. It is now the third one, after the Saint-Nazaire bridge and the √éle de R√© bridge. It has been toll-free since 1991.

To get to the island, it is possible to arrive at the stations of Surg√®res, Saintes or Rochefort, then take the bus.
On the island itself, the easiest way to get around is by car or by bicycle. During the last ten years, a network of of bicycle paths have been built. These bicycle lanes are mostly car-free.

==Tourism==

As a large Atlantic island only off the Aquitanian coast of France, Ol√©ron is a popular tourist destination. Several companies operate boat trips from the towns of Boyardville and Saint-Denis to the nearby √éle d&#x27;Aix, La Rochelle, and past the Fort Boyard. The port towns are frequently visited by tourists, especially the village of La Cotiniere. This village is the base for a hundred trawlers who sell their fish every day at 5 am and 4 pm. La Cotiniere was the first fishing port in the department of Charente-Maritime, and the 8th of France.

<text>A Walking Tour of the Shambles (Little Walks For Sightseers #16) (2002), written by Neil Gaiman and Gene Wolfe, is a novel in the form of a tour guide concerning a fictional part of Chicago called &#x27;The Shambles&#x27;. It guides the reader through such non-existent landmarks as The House of Clocks (according to the official website), Cereal House (home of the Terribly Strange Bed), and Gavagan&#x27;s Irish Saloon. A collaboration between Neil Gaiman and Gene Wolfe (cover by Gahan Wilson, with interior illustrations by Randy Broecker and Earl Geier), it was published with two different covers by the American Fantasy Press (one crediting &quot;Gaiman and Wolfe&quot;, the other crediting &quot;Wolfe and Gaiman&quot;). Although Chicago doesn&#x27;t have a Shambles, Philadelphia, for instance, does.

<text>The Bibliotheca (Ancient Greek: ), is a compendium of Greek myths and heroic legends, genealogical tables and histories arranged in three books, generally dated to the first or second century AD. The work is commonly described as having been written by Apollodorus (or sometimes Pseudo-Apollodorus), a result of its false attribution to the 2nd-century BC scholar Apollodorus of Athens.

== Overview ==
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus is a compressive collection of myths, genealogies and histories that presents a continuous history of Greek mythology from the earliest gods and the origin of the world to the death of Odysseus. The narratives are organized by genealogy, chronology and geography in summaries of myth. The myths are sourced from a wide number of sources like early epic, early Hellenistic poets, and mythographical summaries of tales. Homer and Hesiod are the most frequently named along with other poets. Oral tradition and the plays written by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides also factored into the compilation of myth in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; was written in the first or second century CE by an author who is referred to as Pseudo-Apollodorus to differentiate from Apollodorus of Athens, who did not write the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;. Most extant manuscripts of the text end during the narration of Theseus&#x27;s exploits, with there surviving only two codices, discovered in the 19th century, which transmit the remainder of the work. In the later scholarship it is used as a reference material.

== Authorship ==
A certain &quot;Apollodorus&quot; is indicated as author on some surviving manuscripts, this Apollodorus has been mistakenly identified with Apollodorus of Athens (born E), a student of Aristarchus of Samothrace who also worked in Alexandria. It is known‚Äîfrom references in the minor scholia on Homer‚Äîthat Apollodorus of Athens did leave a similar comprehensive repertory on mythology, in the form of a verse chronicle. The mistaken attribution was made by scholars following mention of the name by Photius I of Constantinople, though Photius did not name him as the Athenian and the name was in common use at the time. For chronological reasons, Apollodorus of Athens could not have written the book, the author of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; is at times referred to as the &quot;Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot;, to distinguish him from Apollodorus of Athens. Modern works often simply call him &quot;Apollodorus&quot;. The work is generally dated to the first or second centuries AD.

== Manuscript tradition ==
The first mention of the work is by Photius, patriarch of Constantinople in 9th century CE, in his &quot;account of books read&quot;. The last section of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; which breaks off during the section on Theseus is missing in surviving manuscripts, Photius had the full work and mentions that the lost section had myths about the heroes of the Trojan War. Byzantine author John Tzetes, who lived in Constantinople in the twelfth century, often cited the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; in his writings. It was almost lost in the 13th century, surviving in one now-incomplete manuscript, which was copied for Cardinal Bessarion in the 15th century. Any surviving manuscripts of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; are descended from a fourteenth century manuscript in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, in Paris.

== Printed editions ==
The first printed edition of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus was published in Rome in 1555. Benedetto Egio (Benedictus Aegius) of Spoleto, was the first to divide the text in three books. published an improved text at Heidelberg, 1559. The first text based on comparative manuscripts was that of Christian Gottlob Heyne, G√∂ttingen, 1782‚Äì83. Subsequent editions Jurgen Muller (1841) and Richard Wagner (1894) collated earlier manuscripts. In 1921 Sir James George Frazer published an epitome of the book by conflating two manuscript summaries of the text, which included the lost section.

== Scholarship ==
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; has been referenced in scholarship throughout history. As a mythographical work it has influenced scholarship on Greek mythology. An epigram recorded by the important intellectual Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople expressed its purpose:It has the following not ungraceful epigram: &#x27;Draw your knowledge of the past from me and read the ancient tales of learned lore. Look neither at the page of Homer, nor of elegy, nor tragic muse, nor epic strain. Seek not the vaunted verse of the cycle; but look in me and you will find in me all that the world contains&#x27;.Photius is one of the first surviving reviews of the use of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; in the field. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries CE, the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; was referred to in scholarship about Ancient Greece most often found in letters from scholars of the time. Much of the modern scholarship on the work has focused on the interpretation of its manuscripts by various translators and compilers of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; in later editions. A critical view of past interpretations, compilations, and organization has also been a source of contention. The sources of information that may have informed the creation of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; are also studied in the modern scholarship. The question of authorship is another area of study that has shaped the interpretation of the work throughout history.

<text>Gee Vaucher (born Carole Vaucher in 1945 in Dagenham, Essex, England) is a visual artist primarily associated with the anarcho-punk band Crass.

== Biography ==
Vaucher met her long-lasting creative partner Penny Rimbaud in the early 1960s when both were attending the South-East Essex Technical College and School of Art. The name &#x27;Gee&#x27; derives from &#x27;Grout&#x27;, Rimbaud having responded to something Vaucher was complaining about with &#x27;stop grouting&#x27; (rather than &#x27;stop grousing&#x27;); &quot;I said, &#x27;you mean grousing&#x27;. Anyway, the Grout name stuck and everyone started calling me Grout, and then it gradually got shortened to Gee.&quot;

In 1967, inspired by the film &quot;Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, they set up the anarchist/pacifist open house Dial House in Essex, UK, which has now become firmly established as a &#x27;centre for radical creativity&#x27;.

In 2016, Vaucher was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Essex.

Vaucher is vegetarian.

== Works ==
Her work with anarcho-punk band Crass was seminal to the &#x27;protest art&#x27; of the 1980s. Vaucher has always seen her work as a tool for social change, and has expressed her strong anarcho-pacifist and feminist views in her paintings and collages. Vaucher also uses surrealist styles and methods.

She continues to design sleeves for Babel Label, and also designed the sleeve for The Charlatans&#x27; &quot;Who We Touch&quot; album. Vaucher has exhibited at the 96 Gillespie gallery in London. In 2007 and 2008 the Jack Hanley Gallery in San Francisco and Track 16 in Santa Monica ran exhibitions entitled &quot;Gee Vaucher: Introspective&quot;, showing a wide selection of Vaucher&#x27;s work.

The day after Donald Trump&#x27;s election victory in November 2016, the British Daily Mirror newspaper featured Vaucher&#x27;s 1989 painting &quot;Oh America&quot; on its front page.

=== Published collections ===
In the foreword to her first book, a 1999 retrospective collection entitled &quot;Crass Art and Other Pre Post-Modernist Monsters&quot;, Ian Dury writes:
In her second book, &quot;Animal Rites: a pictorial study of relationships&quot;, she gives a commentary on the relationship between animals and humans, centered on the quote &quot;All humans are animals, but some animals are more human than others.&quot;

=== Film ===
Vaucher&#x27;s film &quot;Gower Boy&quot;, made in collaboration with pianist Huw Warren, debuted at the 14th Raindance Film Festival in London in October 2006.

<doc id="85582" wikidata="Q2518565" url="?curid=85582" title="Sterquilinus">
<text>In Roman mythology, Sterquilinus ‚Äî also called Stercutus and Sterculius ‚Äî was a god of odor. He may have been equivalent to Picumnus. The &quot;Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology&quot; gives the name as Stercutius, a pseudonym of Saturn, under which the latter used to supervise the manuring of the fields.

The name Sterquilinus comes from the Latin &quot;stercus&quot; meaning &quot;fertilizer&quot; or &quot;manure&quot;. His name was altered to avoid confusion.

Early Romans were an agrarian civilization and, functionally, most of their original pantheon of gods ‚Äî as against the later ones they adapted to Greek stereotypes ‚Äî were of a rural nature with figures such as Pomona, Ceres, Flora, Dea Dia; so it was apt to have a god supervising the basics of organic fertilization. Sterquilinus essentially taught the use of manure in agricultural processes. He was not the sole deity of feces on its own; as in, sewage.

Modern writers later elaborated upon and exaggerated the significance of Sterquilinus/Sterculius and other &quot;earthy&quot; deities of antiquity, sometimes with moralistic disapproval. One editor of &quot;An Encyclop√¶dia of Plants&quot;, published in 1836, related that Sterculius was the god of the privy, from &quot;stercus&quot;, excrement. It has been well observed by a French author, that the Romans, in the madness of paganism, finished by deifying the most immodest objects and the most disgusting actions. They had the gods Sterculius, Crepitus, Priapus; and the goddesses Caca, Pertunda, &amp;c, &amp;c.

==Popular culture references==
Sterculius was featured in &quot;Peace, Love and Understanding&quot; (1992), the second pilot episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, where his spirit rose from a port-a-potty crushed by a monster truck; he is correctly identified by Butt-Head.

==Namesakes==
:&quot;The following terms and names are derived from Sterculius:&quot;
* Sterculiaceae, a family of flowering plants
** Sterculioideae, a subfamily of the family Malvaceae
*** &quot;Sterculia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae (a reference to unpleasant aroma)

** Stercorarius a genus in the family Stercorariidae
* &quot;Stercoreus&quot; group of the fungus genus &quot;Cyathus&quot;, including &quot;C. stercoreus&quot; (the splash-cup bird&#x27;s nest, or dung-loving bird&#x27;s nest)

<text> (), translated variously as &quot;duty&quot;, &quot;religiosity&quot; or &quot;religious behavior&quot;, &quot;loyalty&quot;, &quot;devotion&quot;, or &quot;filial piety&quot; (English &quot;piety&quot; derives from the Latin), was one of the chief virtues among the ancient Romans. It was the distinguishing virtue of the founding hero Aeneas, who is often given the adjectival epithet (&quot;religious&quot;) throughout Virgil&#x27;s epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;. The sacred nature of was embodied by the divine personification Pietas, a goddess often pictured on Roman coins. The Greek equivalent is ().

Cicero defined as the virtue &quot;which admonishes us to do our duty to our country or our parents or other blood relations.&quot; The man who possessed &quot;performed all his duties towards the deity and his fellow human beings fully and in every respect,&quot; as the 19th-century classical scholar Georg Wissowa described it. Cicero suggests people should have awareness of their own honor and must always attempt to raise the honor of others with dignified praise. Furthermore, praise, admiration, and honored actions must be beyond all one&#x27;s own desires, and actions and words must be chosen with respect to friends, colleagues, family, or blood relations. Cicero describes youth in the pursuit of honour: ‚ÄúHow they yearn for praise! What labours will they not undertake to stand fast among their peers! How will they remember those who have shown them kindness and how eager to repay it!‚Äù

The first recorded use of in English occurs in Anselm Bayly&#x27;s &quot;The Alliance of Music, Poetry, and Oratory&quot;, published in 1789.

==As virtue==

The credibility of a commander relied heavily on their willingness to set aside personal gain and fully dedicate themselves to a cause, refraining from any treacherous actions. This emphasis on credibility led to the reputation of individual commanders and the Roman state itself playing a pragmatic role in negotiations and discussions. Commanders&#x27; commitment to needed to be consistent, demonstrating credibility through ongoing actions and a steady approach in dealings with neighboring entities. Upholding respect for existing contracts meant honoring pledges and oaths, thus reinforcing Rome&#x27;s commitment to ethical behavior and the continuation of diplomatic strategies. The chances of resolving conflicts were minimal if deceit became the standard in negotiations by commanders.

As such, a stork appears next to Pietas on a coin issued by Metellus Pius (on whose see above).

==As goddess==

The Temple of Piety at Rome was solemnly vowed by the plebeian consul and new man Manius Acilius Glabrio at the Battle of Thermopylae in, where he defeated the emperor Antiochus the Great during the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War. Completed by his son, it was erected at the northwest end of the Roman vegetable market () near the Carmental Gate. It included a gold statue of the father, the first such statue of a Roman citizen in the city.

According to a miraculous legend (), a poor woman who was starving in prison was saved when her daughter gave her breast milk (compare Roman Charity). Caught in the act, the daughter was not punished, but recognized for her . Mother and daughter were set free, and given public support for the rest of their lives.

<text>In Roman mythology, Pilumnus (&quot;staker&quot;) was a nature deity, brother of Picumnus. He ensured children grew properly and stayed healthy. Ancient Romans made an extra bed after the birth of a child in order to ensure the help of Pilumnus. He also taught humanity how to grind grain. He was also sometimes identified as the husband of Dana√´, and therefore the father of Danaus and the ancestor of Turnus.

A ceremony to honour the deity involved driving a stake into the ground.

<text>Pomona (, ) was a goddess of fruitful abundance and plenty in ancient Roman religion and myth. Her name comes from the Latin word &quot;pomum&quot;, &quot;fruit&quot;, specifically orchard fruit. 

Pomona was said to be a wood nymph. Pomona does not have a clear counterpart in Greek mythology, although the fruit goddess Opora can be seen as her equivalent.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;P≈çm≈çna&quot; is a derivation from Latin &quot;p≈çmus&quot; (&#x27;fruit-tree, fruit&#x27;), possibly stemming from Proto-Italic &quot;*po-e/omo&quot; (&#x27;taken off, picked?&#x27;), cognate with Umbrian Puemune, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h‚ÇÅe/omo&quot; (&#x27;what is (to be) taken&#x27;).

==Mythology==
In the myth narrated by Ovid, she scorned the love of the woodland gods Silvanus and Picus, but married Vertumnus after he tricked her, disguised as an old woman. She and Vertumnus shared a festival held on August 13. Her priest was called the &quot;flamen Pomonalis&quot;. The pruning knife was her attribute. There is a grove that is sacred to her called the &quot;Pomonal&quot;, located not far from Ostia, the ancient port of Rome.

Pomona was the goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards. Unlike many other Roman goddesses and gods, she does not have a Greek counterpart, though she is commonly associated with Demeter. She watches over and protects fruit trees and cares for their cultivation. She was not actually associated with the harvest of fruits itself, but with the flourishing of the fruit trees. In artistic depictions she is generally shown with a platter of fruit or a cornucopia.

==Namesakes==
The city of Pomona, California, in Los Angeles County, is named after the goddess. Pomona College was founded in the city and retained its name even after relocating to its present-day location in Claremont.

The township of Pomona, Illinois, in Jackson County, is named after the goddess. The township is home to mainly agricultural land, and has wineries and orchards in the vicinity.

The town of Pomona Park, Florida, in Putnam County is named after the goddess of fruit from the time citrus horticulture dominated the economy of the area.

The Pomona Docks (formerly part of the Manchester docks) were built on the site of the Pomona Gardens. A former public house nearby was named the Pomona Palace. 

32 Pomona is a main belt asteroid discovered in 1854.

In 2003 a newly discovered honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;) subspecies was named after Pomona being called the &quot;Apis mellifera pomonella&quot;. It was discovered in the Tien Shan Mountains, an area with the greatest genetic diversity for a wild &quot;Malus&quot; species, &quot;M. sieversii&quot;, that is the predominant ancestor of domesticated apple varieties, which are typically pollinated by honey bees on a commercial scale.

Pomona is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Noosa, Queensland, Australia. It is about 135 kilometres north of Brisbane. The town was originally called Pinbarren Siding from 1890-1900 as a subsidiary to Pinbarren. In the , the locality of Pomona had a population of 2,931 people. Pomona was renamed in 1900, after the Roman goddess of fruit, following the government rejection of the names Pinbarren and Cooroora. Its name avoided confusion with the neighbouring towns of Cooroy and Cooran and reflected the fertile nature in the area.

==Representations in art==
A bronze statue of Pomona sits atop the Pulitzer Fountain in Manhattan&#x27;s Grand Army Plaza in New York. The fountain was funded by newspaper tycoon Joseph Pulitzer, designed by the architect Thomas Hastings, and crowned by a statue conceived by the sculptor Karl Bitter. The fountain was dedicated in May 1916.

Pomona is briefly mentioned in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;.

&quot;Der Sieg der fruchtbaren Pomona&quot; (&quot;The Victory of Fruitful Pomona&quot;) is a 1702 opera by Reinhard Keiser.

&quot;Pomona&quot; is the title of a play by Alistair McDowell, commissioned in 2014 for the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

Pomona is one of three statues featured at the Massachusetts Horticulture Society&#x27;s Elm Bank Horticulture Center, along with Ceres and Flora.

<text>In Roman mythology, Vertumnus (; also Vortumnus or Vertimnus) is the god of seasons, change and plant growth, as well as gardens and fruit trees. He could change his form at will; using this power, according to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (xiv), he tricked Pomona into talking to him by disguising himself as an old woman and gaining entry to her orchard, then using a narrative warning of the dangers of rejecting a suitor (the embedded tale of Iphis and Anaxarete) to seduce her. The tale of Vertumnus and Pomona has been called &quot;the first exclusively Latin tale.&quot;

Vertumnus&#x27;s festival was called the Vertumnalia and was held 13 August.

==Cult and origin==

The name &quot;Vortumnus&quot; most likely derives from Etruscan &quot;Voltumna&quot;. Its formation in Latin was probably influenced by the Latin verb &quot;vertere&quot; meaning &quot;to change&quot;, hence the alternative form &quot;Vertumnus&quot;. Ancient etymologies were based on often superficial similarities of sound rather than the principles of modern scientific linguistics, but reflect ancient interpretations of a deity&#x27;s function. In writing about the Festival of Vesta in his poem on the Roman calendar, Ovid recalls a time when the forum was still a reedy swamp and &quot;that god, Vertumnus, whose name fits many forms, / Wasn‚Äôt yet so-called from damming back the river&quot; (&quot;averso amne&quot;).

Varro was convinced that Vortumnus was Etruscan, and a major god. Vertumnus&#x27;s cult arrived in Rome around 300 BC, and a temple to him was constructed on the Aventine Hill by 264 BC, the date when Volsinii (Etruscan Velzna) fell to the Romans. Propertius, the major literary source for the god, also asserts that the god was Etruscan, and came from Volsinii.

Propertius refers to a bronze statue of Vortumnus made by the legendary Mamurius Veturius, who was also credited with the twelve ritual shields &quot;(ancilia)&quot; of Mars&#x27;s priests, known as the Salii. The bronze statue replaced an ancient maple statue &quot;(xoanon)&quot; supposed to have been brought to Rome in the time of Romulus. The statue of Vortumnus &quot;(signum Vortumni)&quot; stood in a simple shrine located at the Vicus Tuscus near the Forum Romanum, and was decorated according to the changing seasons. In his poem about the god, Propertius has the statue of Vortumnus speak in first-person as if to a passer-by.

The base of the statue was discovered in 1549, perhaps still &quot;in situ&quot;, but has since been lost. An inscription commemorated a restoration to the statue under Diocletian and Maximian in the early 4th¬†century¬†AD.

==Neo-classical tradition==

The subject of &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot; appealed to European sculptors and painters of the 16th through the 18th centuries, providing a disguised erotic subtext in a scenario that contrasted youthful female beauty with an aged crone. In narrating the tale in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid had observed that the kind of kisses given by Vertumnus were never given by an old woman: &quot;so Circe&#x27;s smile conceals a wicked intention, and Vertumnus&#x27;s hot kisses ill suit an old woman&#x27;s disguise&quot;.

The subject was even woven into tapestry in series with the generic theme &quot;Loves of the Gods&quot;, of which the mid-16th-century Brussels tapestry at Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, woven to cartoons attributed to Jan Vermeyen, must be among the earliest. Fran√ßois Boucher provided designs for the tapestry-weaver Maurice Jacques at the Gobelins tapestry manufactory for a series that included &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot; (1775‚Äì1778). A similar theme of erotic disguise is found with &quot;Jupiter wooing Callisto in the guise of Diana&quot;, an example of which is at the J. Paul Getty Museum.

Mme de Pompadour, who sang well and danced gracefully, played the role of &quot;Pomone&quot; in a pastoral presented to a small audience at Versailles; the sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne (1760) alludes to the event. 
Camille Claudel sculpted a sensual marble version of &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot; in 1905 (Mus√©e Rodin, Paris).

Joseph Brodsky wrote a poem about Vertumnus.

==Modern interpretations==
David Littlefield finds in the episode a movement from rape to mutual desire, effected against an orderly, &quot;civilised&quot; Latian landscape.

Conversely, Roxanne Gentilcore reads in its diction and narrative strategies images of deception, veiled threat and seduction, in which Pomona, the tamed hamadryad now embodying the orchard, does not have a voice.

<text>Portunus was the ancient Roman god of keys, doors, livestock and ports. He may have originally protected the warehouses where grain was stored, but later became associated with ports, perhaps because of folk associations between &quot;porta&quot; &quot;gate, door&quot; and &quot;portus&quot; &quot;harbor&quot;, the &quot;gateway&quot; to the sea, or because of an expansion in the meaning of &quot;portus&quot;. Portunus later became conflated with the Greek Palaemon.

Portunus&#x27; festival, celebrated on August 17, the sixteenth day before the Kalends of September, was the Portunalia, a minor occasion in the Roman year. On this day, keys were thrown into a fire for good luck in a very solemn and lugubrious manner. His attribute was a key and his main temple in the city of Rome, the Temple of Portunus, was to be found in the Forum Boarium near the city&#x27;s oldest riverine port, the , and the oldest stone bridge over the river, the Pons Aemilius.
Portunus appears to be closely related to the god Janus, with whom he shares many characters, functions and the symbol of the key. He too was represented as a two headed being, with each head facing opposite directions, on coins and as figurehead of ships. He was considered to be &quot;deus portuum portarumque praeses&quot; (lit. God presiding over ports and gates). The relationship between the two gods is underlined by the fact that the date chosen for the dedication of the rebuilt temple of Janus in the Forum Holitorium by emperor Tiberius is the day of the Portunalia, August 17.

Linguist Giuliano Bonfante has speculated, on the grounds of his cult and of the meaning of his name, that Portunus should be a very archaic deity and might date back to an era when Latins lived in dwellings built on pilings. He argues that in Latin the words &quot;porta&quot; (door, gate) and &quot;portus&quot; (harbour, port) share their etymology from the same Indo-European root meaning &quot;ford&quot;, &quot;wading point&quot;.

Portunus&#x27; flamen, the flamen Portunalis, was one of the flamines minores and performed the ritual of oiling the spear (&quot;hasta&quot;) on the statue of god Quirinus, with an ointment especially prepared for this purpose and stored in a small vase (&quot;persillum&quot;).

<text>In Roman mythology, Postverta or Postvorta was the goddess of the past and one of the two Carmentes (along with her sister Antevorta, or Prorsa, a contracted form of &quot;Proversa&quot;). They were companions of the goddess Carmenta, and probably embodied her aspects as the goddess of the past (Postvorta) and the future (Antevorta, or Prorsa).

During childbirth, prayers were offered to summon the Carmentes to preside over the labor. Porrima was said to be present at the birth when the baby was born head-first; Postverta, when the feet of the baby came first.

<text>Procas or Proca (said to have reigned 817-794 BC) was one of the Latin kings of Alba Longa in the mythic tradition of the founding of Rome. He was the father of Amulius and Numitor and the great-grandfather of Romulus and Remus, Rome&#x27;s legendary founders.

==The name==

The names of the Alban kings are often related to toponyms around Rome, or to legendary figures in the early history of Rome. The constructed genealogies in which they appear may reflect the desire of status-seeking families in the Late Republic to lay claim to Trojan ilirian ancestry. The name &quot;Procas&quot; or &quot;Proca&quot; may be related to the mythological figure Prochyte, a kinswoman of Aeneas who died when the fleet carrying the refugees of Troy to Italy was within sight of the coast. She was buried on the island that bore her name.

<text>Pudicitia (&quot;modesty&quot; or &quot;sexual virtue&quot;) was a central concept in ancient Roman sexual ethics. The word is derived from the more general &quot;pudor&quot;, the sense of shame that regulated an individual&#x27;s behavior as socially acceptable. &quot;Pudicitia&quot; was most often a defining characteristic of women, but men who failed to conform to masculine sexual norms were said to exhibit feminizing &quot;impudicitia&quot;, sexual shamelessness. The virtue was personified by the Roman goddess Pudicitia, whose Greek equivalent was Aidos.

==As virtue==

Romans, both men and women, were expected to uphold the virtue of &quot;pudicitia&quot;, a complex ideal that was explored by many ancient writers, including Livy, Valerius Maximus, Cicero, Tacitus and Tertullian. Livy describes the legendary figure of Lucretia as the epitome of &quot;pudicitia&quot;. She is loyal to her husband and is modest, despite her incredible beauty. Some say that the story of Lucretia shows that the more virtuous a woman was, the more appealing she was to potential adulterers.

&quot;Pudicitia&quot; was not only a mental attribute but also physical; a person&#x27;s appearance was seen as an indicator of their morality. The way a man or woman presented him or herself in public, and the persons they interacted with caused others to pass judgment on their &quot;pudicitia&quot;. For example, if a woman was seen associating with men other than her husband people would make a negative judgment on her &quot;pudicitia&quot;. Romans idealized the woman who was &quot;univira&quot;, a &quot;one-man&quot; woman, married once, even though by the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar, divorce was common, the subject of gossip rather than social stigma. Modest self-presentation indicated &quot;pudicitia&quot;. The opposite of &quot;pudicitia&quot; was &quot;impudicitia&quot;, &quot;shamelessness&quot; or ‚Äúsexual vice.‚Äù An assault on &quot;pudicitia&quot; was &quot;stuprum&quot;, sexual misconduct or &quot;sex crime.&quot;

Romans associated the loss of &quot;pudicitia&quot; with chaos and loss of control. In Cicero&#x27;s oration against Verres, he discusses many of the governor&#x27;s transgressions including sexual misconduct with both men and women. In the Imperial age, Augustus enacted a program of moral legislation to encourage &quot;pudicitia&quot;.

==The goddess==
According to Livy, there were two temples of Pudicitia in Rome, the Temple of Pudicitia Patricia and the Temple of Pudicitia Plebeia. The original one was for women of the patrician class only, but when Verginia was excluded on account of marrying a plebeian consul, she and a group of plebeian matrons founded an altar of Pudicitia for women of the plebeian class as well. Livy states that the plebeian shrine of Pudicitia eventually fell into disuse after its sacred character had been abused.

According to Juvenal, at the end of the Iron Age humanity had grown so cruel and greedy that Pudicitia along with her sister Astraea, goddess of justice, abandoned the earth and returned to the sky, leaving humans to deal with their evil unguided.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Providentia is a divine personification of the ability to foresee and make provision. She was among the embodiments of virtues that were part of the Imperial cult of ancient Rome. Providentia thus figures in art, cult, and literature, but has little or no mythology as such.

&quot;Providentia&quot; was an important moral and philosophical abstraction in Roman discourse. Cicero says it is one of the three main components of &quot;prudentia&quot;, &quot;the knowledge of things that are good or bad or neither,&quot; along with &quot;memoria&quot;, &quot;memory,&quot; and &quot;intellegentia&quot;, &quot;understanding.&quot; The Latin word is the origin of the Christian concept of divine providence.

==Imperial cult==
Upon the death of Augustus, the emperor Tiberius established an altar to Providentia Augusta in recognition of &quot;the godhead manifested in his father&#x27;s provisions for the Roman state.&quot; The cult title Augusta was attached also to such goddesses as Pax, Justitia, and Concordia during the Imperial era. Traditional epithets invoked a deity within a specific functional sphere by declaring their power. The title &quot;Augusta&quot; thus fixed the divinity&#x27;s force within the sphere of the emperor as Augustus.

In 28 AD, after Tiberius arrested and executed Sejanus for conspiracy, the Cult of Virtues played a role in the propaganda that presented the restoration of Imperial order as a return to constitutional government. Sacrifices were offered to Providentia along with Salus (&quot;Security&quot;), Libertas (&quot;Liberty&quot;), and the Genius. Providentia at this time also received a permanent full-time priest &quot;(sacerdos)&quot; devoted to her. In the wake of the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero, religious observances in 59 AD to repair the state included sacrifices by the Arval Brethren to various deities, among them Providentia.
Providentia appeared on Roman coins issued under Vespasian, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Septimius Severus, Commodus, Pertinax, and Diocletian. A coin issued by Titus depicted his deified father Vespasian handing a globe to his son as his successor, with the legend &quot;Providentia Augusta&quot;. Coins issued by Nerva depicted the Genius of the Senate handing the globe to the new emperor, with the legend &quot;Providentia Senatus&quot;, &quot;the Providence of the Senate.&quot;

==Providentia in numismatics==
Providentia has been the main motif for many collector coins and medals, the most recent one being the 100 euro Sculpture Gold coin issued on November 13, 2002. The reverse features the Providentia Fountain (&quot;Provendentia Brunnen&quot;) in central Vienna, work of one of the greatest Baroque sculptors Georg Rafael Donner. In the centre of the coin, the allegorical figure of Providentia with a medallion of the Roman god, Janus, who had two faces, is displayed. Surrounding the fountain there are other symbolic figures representing tributary rivers of the Danube. Providentia is enthroned high above the figure of an old man representing the Enns River.

<text>In Roman mythology and religion, Quirinus ( , ) is an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, &quot;Quirinus&quot; was also an epithet of Janus, as &quot;Janus Quirinus&quot;.

== Name ==

===Attestations===
The name of god Quirinus is recorded across Roman sources as &quot;Curinus&quot;, &quot;Corinus&quot;, &quot;Querinus&quot;, &quot;Queirinus&quot; and &quot;QVIRINO&quot;, also as fragmented &quot;IOVI. CYRIN[O]&quot;. The name is also attested as a surname to Hercules as &quot;Hercules Quirinus&quot;.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Quirƒ´nus&quot; probably stems from Latin &quot;quirƒ´s&quot;, the name of Roman citizens in their peacetime function. Since both &quot;quirƒ´s&quot; and &quot;Quirƒ´nus&quot; are connected with Sabellic immigrants into Rome in ancient legends, it may be a loanword. The meaning &quot;wielder of the spear&quot; (Sabine &quot;quiris&quot;, &#x27;spear&#x27;, cf. &quot;Janus Quirinus&quot;), or a derivation from the Sabine town of Cures, have been proposed by Ovid in his &quot;&quot;Fasti&quot;&quot; 2.477-480.

Some scholars have interpreted the name as a contraction of &quot;*Co-Virƒ´nus&quot; (originally the protector of the community, cf. &quot;c≈´ria&quot; &lt; &quot;*co-viria&quot;), descending from an earlier *&quot;Co-Wironos&quot;, itself from the Proto-Indo-European noun (&quot;man&quot;). Linguist Michiel de Vaan argues that this etymology &quot;is not credible phonetically and not very compelling semantically.&quot;

==Depiction and worship==
In earlier Roman art, Quirinus was portrayed as a bearded man with religious and military clothing. However, he was almost never depicted in later Roman art. His main festival was the Quirinalia, held on February¬†17.

The priest of Quirinus, the &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot;, was one of the three patrician &quot;flamines maiores&quot; (&quot;major flamens&quot;) who had precedence over the Pontifex Maximus.

==History==
Quirinus most likely was originally a Sabine war god. The Sabines had a settlement near the eventual site of Rome, and erected an altar to Quirinus on the &quot;Collis Quirinalis&quot;, Quirinal Hill, one of the Seven hills of Rome. When the Romans settled in the area, the cult of Quirinus became part of their early belief system. This occurred before the later influences from classical Greek culture.

===Deified Romulus===
By the end of the 1st¬†century¬†BCE, Quirinus would be considered to be the deified legendary first king, Romulus.

In his &quot;Life of Romulus&quot;, Plutarch wrote that, shortly after Rome&#x27;s founder had disappeared under what some considered suspicious circumstances, a Roman noble named Proculus Julius reported that Romulus had come to him while he was travelling. He claimed that Romulus had instructed him to tell his countrymen that he, Romulus, was Quirinus.

===Brelich&#x27;s argument for split deification===
Historian Angelo Brelich argued that Quirinus and Romulus were originally the same divine entity which was split into a founder hero and a god when Roman religion became demythicised. To support this, he points to the association of both Romulus and Quirinus with the grain spelt, through the &quot;Fornacalia&quot; or &quot;Stultorum Feriae&quot;, according to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot;.

The last day of the festival is called the &quot;Quirinalia&quot; and corresponds with the traditional day of Romulus&#x27; death. On that day, the Romans would toast spelt as an offering to the goddess Fornax. In one version of the legend of Romulus&#x27; death cited by Plutarch, he was killed and cut into pieces by the nobles and each of them took a part of his body home and buried it on their land.

Brelich claimed this pattern ‚Äì a festival involving a staple crop, a god, and a tale of a slain founding hero whose body parts are buried in the soil ‚Äì is a recognized mytheme that arises when such a split takes place in a culture&#x27;s mythology (see &quot;Dema deity&quot; archetype). The possible presence of the &quot;Flamen Quirinalis&quot; at the festival of Acca Larentia would corroborate this thesis, given the fact that Romulus is a stepson of hers, and one of the original twelve arval brethren (Fratres Arvales).

===The Grabovian pantheon===
The association of Quirinus and Romulus is further supported by a connection with Vofionos, the third god in the triad of the Grabovian gods of Iguvium. Vofionos would be the equivalent of Liber or Teutates, in Latium and among the Celts respectively.

===The Capitoline Triad===
His early importance led to Quirinus&#x27; inclusion in the Archaic Triad (the first Capitoline Triad), along with Mars (then an agriculture god) and Jupiter.

Over time, however, Quirinus became less significant, and he was absent from the later, more widely known triad (he and Mars had been replaced by Juno and Minerva). Varro mentions the &quot;Capitolium Vetus&quot;, an earlier cult site on the Quirinal, devoted to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, among whom Martial makes a distinction between the &quot;old Jupiter&quot; and the &quot;new&quot;.

===Fade into obscurity===
Eventually, Romans began to favor personal and mystical cults over the official state belief system. These included those of Bacchus, Cybele, and Isis, leaving only Quirinus&#x27; flamen to worship him.

===Legacy===
Even centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Quirinal hill in Rome, originally named from the deified Romulus, was still associated with power. in 1583 Gregory XIII chose the site for his summer palace, this palace would come to be known as the Quirinal Palace. after the Capture of Rome, it was chosen as the seat of the Kingdom by the House of Savoy and later after the Abolition of the Monarchy it became the residence of the Presidents of the Italian Republic.

<text>Quiritis was a Sabine (pre-Roman) goddess of motherhood. She was often associated with protection. In later years, Quiritis was identified with the goddess Juno, who was sometimes worshipped under the name Juno Quiritis (or Juno Curitis). Some scholars believe that Juno was in fact merely another version of Quiritis, although others say that the two are linked merely by borrowing.

Her name is believed to have derived from a Sabine word meaning &quot;lance&quot; or &quot;spear&quot;, and she is often depicted holding that weapon (presumably in defence of someone or something). This is a feature that was incorporated into Juno&#x27;s identity. Traditionally, Roman marriages included a ritual where the bride&#x27;s hair was cut or parted with a spear - some see this as the result of Juno&#x27;s association with marriage, although other explanations for the ritual are given as well.

Juno Quiritis is said to have been the only deity worshipped by all thirty of the original &quot;curiae&quot; (political and military divisions) established by Romulus. There was a temple to Juno Quiritis on the Campus Martius, an area where soldiers traditionally trained.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Rumina, Rumilia or Rumia, also known as Diva Rumina, was a goddess who protected breastfeeding mothers, and possibly nursing infants. Her domain extended to protecting animal mothers, not just human ones. As one of the &quot;indigitamenta&quot;, Rumina lacked the elaborate mythology and personality of later Roman deities, and was instead a more abstract, numinous entity.

Rumina&#x27;s temple was near the &quot;Ficus Ruminalis&quot;, the fig tree at the foot of the Palatine Hill where Romulus and Remus were raised by a she-wolf. Milk, rather than the typical wine, was offered as a sacrifice at this temple. In AD 58, the tree started to die, which was interpreted as a bad omen.

<text>A generation ship, generation starship or world ship, is a hypothetical type of interstellar ark starship that travels at sub-light speed. Since such a ship might require hundreds to thousands of years to reach nearby stars, the original occupants of a generation ship would grow old and die, leaving their descendants to continue traveling.

== Origins ==
Rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard was the first to write about long-duration interstellar journeys in his &quot;The Ultimate Migration&quot; (1918). In this he described the death of the Sun and the necessity of an &quot;interstellar ark&quot;. The crew would travel for centuries in suspended animation and be awakened when they reached another star system. He proposed to use small moons or asteroids as ships, and speculated that the crew would endure psychological and genetic changes over the generations.

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, considered a father of astronautic theory, first described the need for multiple generations of passengers in his essay, &quot;The Future of Earth and Mankind&quot; (1928), outlining a space colony equipped with engines that travels thousands of years which he called &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. In the story, the crew had changed so much over the generations at so many levels that they did not even acknowledge Earth as their home planet. 

Another early description of a generation ship is in the 1929 essay &quot;The World, The Flesh, &amp; The Devil&quot; by John Desmond Bernal. Bernal&#x27;s essay was the first publication to reach the public and influence other writers. He wrote about the concept of human evolution and mankind&#x27;s future in space through methods of living that we now describe as a generation starship, and which could be seen in the generic word &quot;globes&quot;.

== Definition ==
According to Hein et al., a &quot;generation ship&quot; is a spacecraft on which a crew is living on-board for at least several decades, such that it comprises multiple generations. Several sub-categories of generation ships are distinguished: sprinter, slow boat, colony ship, world ship.
The Enzmann starship is categorised as &quot;slow boat&quot; because of the &quot;Astronomy Magazine&quot; title &quot;Slow Boat to Centauri&quot; (1977). Gregory Matloff&#x27;s concept is called a &quot;colony ship&quot; and Alan Bond called his concept a &quot;world ship&quot;. These definitions are essentially based on the velocity of the ship and population size.

==Obstacles==

===Biosphere===
Such a ship would have to be entirely self-sustaining, providing life support for everyone aboard. It must have extraordinarily reliable systems that could be maintained by the ship&#x27;s inhabitants over long periods of time. This would require testing whether thousands of humans could survive on their own before sending them beyond the reach of help. Small artificial closed ecosystems, such as Biosphere 2, have been built in an attempt to examine the engineering challenges of such a system, with mixed results.

===Biology and society===
Generation ships would have to anticipate possible biological, social and morale problems, and would also need to deal with matters of self-worth and purpose for the various crews involved.

Estimates of the minimum reasonable population for a generation ship vary. Anthropologist John Moore has estimated that, without genetic testing of people before boarding the ship, social control and / or social engineering (such as requiring people to wait until their thirties to have children), nor cryopreservation of eggs, sperm, or embryos (as is done in sperm banks), a minimum of 160 people boarding the ship would allow normal family life (with the average individual having ten potential marriage partners) throughout a 200-year space journey, with little loss of genetic diversity. If the people who board the ship are couples, presumably in their early twenties, and everybody who lives in the ship is required to wait until their mid to late thirties before having children, then the minimum would be just 80 people. However, many variables are not accounted for in the estimate, including the higher chance of health problems for both the woman who is pregnant and the fetus or baby because of the pregnant woman&#x27;s age. In 2013, anthropologist Cameron Smith reviewed existing literature and created a new computer model to estimate a minimum reasonable population in the tens of thousands. Smith&#x27;s numbers were much larger than previous estimates such as Moore&#x27;s, in part because Smith takes the risk of accidents and disease into consideration, and assumes at least one severe population catastrophe over the course of a 150-year journey.

In light of the multiple generations that it could take to reach even our nearest neighboring star systems such as Proxima Centauri, further issues on the viability of such interstellar arks include:

* the possibility of humans dramatically evolving in directions unacceptable to the sponsors
* the minimum population required to maintain in isolation a culture acceptable to the sponsors; this could include such aspects as
** ability to learn scientific and technical skills needed to maintain, operate and pilot the ship
** ability to accomplish the purpose (planetary colonization, research, building new interstellar arks) contemplated
** sharing the values of the sponsors, which may not be likely to be empirically demonstrated to be viable beyond the home planet unless, once the ship is away from Earth and on its way, survival of one&#x27;s offspring until the ship reaches the target star is one motivation.

===Size===
For a spacecraft to maintain a stable environment for multiple generations, it would have to be large enough to support a community of humans and a fully recycling ecosystem. A spacecraft of such a size would require much energy to accelerate and decelerate. A smaller spacecraft, while able to accelerate more easily and thus make higher cruise velocities more practical, would reduce exposure to cosmic radiation and the time for malfunctions to develop in the craft, but would have challenges with resource metabolic flow and ecologic balance.

===Social breakdown===
Generation ships traveling for long periods of time may see breakdowns in social structures. Changes in society (for example, mutiny) could occur over such periods and may prevent the ship from reaching its destination. This state was described by Algis Budrys in a 1966 book review:

Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Orphans of the Sky&quot; (the &quot;impeccable statement of this theme&quot;, Budrys said) and Brian Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;Non-Stop&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;Starship&quot;) discussed such societies.

===Cosmic rays===
The radiation environment of deep space is very different from that on the Earth&#x27;s surface, or in low Earth orbit, due to the much larger influx of high-energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Like other ionizing radiation, high-energy cosmic rays can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer, cataracts, and neurological disorders.

==Ethical considerations==
The success of a generation ship depends on children born aboard taking over the necessary duties, as well as having children themselves. Even if their quality of life might be better than, for example, that of people born into poverty on Earth, philosophy professor Neil Levy has raised the question of whether it is ethical to severely constrain life choices of individuals by locking them into a project they did not choose. A moral quandary exists regarding how intermediate generations, those destined to be born and die in transit without actually seeing tangible results of their efforts, might feel about their forced existence on such a ship.

==Project Hyperion==
Project Hyperion, launched in December 2011 by Andreas M. Hein, was to perform a preliminary study that defines integrated concepts for a crewed interstellar generation ship. This was a two-year study mainly based out of the WARR student group at the Technical University of Munich. The study aimed to provide an assessment of the feasibility of crewed interstellar flight using current and near-future technologies. It also aimed to guide future research and technology development plans as well as to inform the public about crewed interstellar travel. Notable results of the project include an assessment of world ship system architectures and adequate population size. The core team members have transferred to the Initiative for Interstellar Studies&#x27;s world ship project and a survey paper on generation ships has been presented at the ESA Interstellar Workshop in 2019 as well as in ESA&#x27;s Acta Futura journal.

<doc id="85623" wikidata="Q1753275" url="?curid=85623" title="Sancus">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Sancus (also known as Sangus or Semo Sancus) was a god of trust (), honesty, and oaths. His cult, one of the most ancient amongst the Romans, probably derived from Umbrian influences. Cato and Silius Italicus wrote that Sancus was a Sabine god and father of the eponymous Sabine hero Sabus. He is thus sometimes considered a founder-deity.

== Oaths ==
Sancus was the god who protected oaths of marriage, hospitality, law, commerce, and particularly formal contracts. Some of the oaths said at the moment of signing a contract ‚Äì or other important civil promissory acts ‚Äì named Sancus as guarantor, and called on him to protect and guard over the honour and integrity of the signatories&#x27; pledges.

== Etymology ==
The place-name is related to the theonym, through the proper name .

&quot;Sancus&quot; derives from a Latin/Umbrian/Sabine source (compare Umbrian &quot;sacra&quot;/ sakra &quot;sacred&quot;, and the Umbrian theonym &quot;Sansi&quot;/Sa√ßi), and is connected to Latin (&#x27;to hallow&#x27;) and hence &quot;sanctus&quot; (&#x27;hallowed&#x27;) and English &quot;saint&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;, &quot;sanctuary&quot;, &quot;sanctity&quot; and &quot;sanction&quot;.

Outside Italic, Hittite has a number of words such as &quot;saklai&quot; &quot;rites&quot; and &quot;sankunnis&quot; &quot;priest&quot; that seem to be clear cognates, suggesting an Indo-European root *&quot;sank-/*sak-&quot; &quot;to sanctify&quot;. It is possible, however, that the former was a loan from Akkadian &quot;sakku (m)&quot; &#x27;cultic rites,&#x27; and the latter may be a loan word from Sumerian &quot;sanga&quot; &quot;administrative priest&quot;.

Woodard has interpreted Sancus as the Roman equivalent of Vedic god Indra (whose name is likely related to Sanskrit &quot;indu&quot; &quot;rain drop&quot;), who has to rely on the help of the Maruts, in his view corresponding to the twelfth Roman of the carmen Arvale, in his task of killing the dragon Vrtra thus freeing the waters and averting draught. He traces the etymology of &quot;Semo&quot; to PIE stem root * bearing the meanings of &#x27;to pour&#x27;, &#x27;ladle&#x27;, &#x27;flow&#x27;, &#x27;drop&#x27; related to rain and sowing. (See more below at &quot;Mars and Semo&quot;)

== Worship ==
The temple dedicated to Sancus stood on the Quirinal Hill, under the name .

Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that the worship of Semo Sancus was imported into Rome at a very early time by the Sabines who occupied the Quirinal Hill. According to tradition his cult was said to have been introduced by the Sabines and perhaps king Titus Tatius dedicated a small shrine. The actual construction of the temple is generally ascribed to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, although it was dedicated by Spurius Postumius on 5June 466BCE.
Sancus was considered the son of Jupiter, an opinion recorded by Varro and attributed to his teacher Aelius Stilo. He was the god of heavenly light, the avenger of dishonesty, the upholder of truth and good faith, the sanctifier of agreements. Hence his identification with Hercules, who was likewise the guardian of the sanctity of oaths. His festival day occurred on the of June (5June).

=== Shrine on Quirinal ===
The shrine on the Quirinal was described by 19thcentury archeologist R.A. Lanciani. It was located near the of the Servian walls, not far from the modern church of San Silvestro al Quirinale, precisely on the . It was described by classical writers as having no roof so as oaths could be taken under the sky.

It had a chapel containing relics of the regal period: A bronze statue of Tanaquil or Gaia Caecilia, her belt containing remedies that people came to collect, her distaff, spindle, and slippers, and after the capture of Privernum in 329BCE, brass medallions or bronze wheels (discs) made of the money confiscated from Vitruvius Vaccus.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus records that the treaty between Rome and Gabii was preserved in this temple. This treaty was perhaps the first international treaty to be recorded and preserved in written form in ancient Rome. It was written on the skin of the ox sacrificed to the god upon its agreement and fixed onto a wooden frame or a shield.

According to Lanciani the foundations of the temple were discovered in March1881, under what was formerly the convent of San Silvestro al Quirinale (or ), later the headquarters of the (former) Royal Engineers. Lanciani relates the monument was a parallelogram in shape, thirty-five feet long by nineteen wide, with walls of travertine and decorations in white marble. It was surrounded by votive altars and the pedestal of statues. In Latin literature it is sometimes called aedes, sometimes sacellum, this last appellation probably connected to the fact it was a sacred space in the open air. Platner &amp; Ashby (1929) though write that its foundations had already been detected in the 16thcentury.

Lanciani supposes the statue depicted in this article might have been found on the site of the shrine on the Quirinal as it appeared in the antiquarian market of Rome at the time of the excavations at San Silvestro.

=== Statue and shrine on Tiber Island and others ===
Semo Sancus had a large sanctuary at Velitrae, now Velletri, in Volscian territory.

There was possibly another shrine or altar () dedicated to Semo Sancus on the Isle of the Tiber, near the temple of . This altar bears the inscription seen and misread by Justin ( read as ) and was discovered on the island in July1574. It is preserved in the of the Vatican Museum, first compartment ( gallery). Lanciani advances the hypothesis that while the shrine on the Quirinal was of Sabine origin that on the Tiber island was Latin.
Claridge (1998) reports that the statue of Sancus (inscribed ) was found on the Tiber Island.

The statue is life-sized and is of the archaic Apollo (kouros) type. The expression of the face and the modeling of the body however are realistic. Both hands are missing, so that it is impossible to say what were the attributes of the god, one being perhaps the club of Hercules and/or the &quot;ossifrage&quot;, the augural bird proper to the god (), hypotheses made by archaeologist Visconti and reported by Lanciani. Other scholars think he should have held lightning bolts in his left hand.

The inscription on the pedestal mentions a .
Lanciani makes reference to a glossa of Sextus Pompeius Festus s.v. which states these were small shrines of lesser divinities, to whom , i.e. lambs two years old, were sacrificed. Fowler (1899) says these priests should have been concerned with lightning bolts, being both the technical term for the , the hole (resembling a well) left by strikes onto the ground and for the victims used to placate the god and purify the site.

=== ‚Äì priests of Semo Sancus ===
For this reason the priests of Semo Sancus were called . They were organised, like a lay corporation, in a under the presidency of a .

Their residence at the shrine on the Quirinal was located adjoining the chapel: it was ample and commodious, provided with a supply of water by means of a lead pipe.
The pipes have been removed to the Capitoline Museum. They bear the same inscription found on the base of the statue.
The statue is now housed in the of the Vatican Palace.
The foundations of the shrine on the Quirinal were destroyed.

Justin Martyr records that Simon Magus, a gnostic mentioned in the Christian Bible, performed such miracles by magic acts during the reign of Claudius that he was regarded as a god and honored with a statue on the island in the Tiber which the two bridges cross, with the inscription , &#x27;to Simon the Holy God&#x27;.
However, in 1574, the Semo Sancus statue was unearthed on the island in question, leading most scholars to believe that Justin confused with &quot;Simon Magus&quot;.

== Origins and significance ==

Even in the ancient world, confusion surrounded this deity, as evidenced by the multiple and unstable forms of his name. Aelius Stilo
identified him with Hercules, and explained also that because the god was called by the Romans &quot;Dius Fidius&quot;, he was a son of Jove by interpreting the expression &quot;Dius Fidius&quot; as &quot;Diovis Filius&quot; (son of Jove); and in order to further clarify the notion of Semo Sancus as a son of Jupiter, he explained the meaning of the expression &quot;Diovis Filius&quot; meaning &quot;son of Jove&quot; by comparing it as an example to the Greek word &quot;Dioskouros&quot; applied to Castor; and claimed that just as the Greeks call for example Castor a &quot;Dioskouros&quot; i.e. a &quot;young boy&quot; or &quot;son&quot; (kouros) of Zeus (Dios); the same way the Romans called Sancus a &quot;Diovis Filius&quot; - a &quot;son of Jove&quot;. In late antiquity, Martianus Capella places Sancus in region12 of his cosmological system, which draws on Etruscan tradition in associating gods with specific parts of the sky.
On the Piacenza Liver the corresponding case bears the theonym &quot;Tluscv&quot;.
The complexity of the theonym and the multiple relationships of the god with other divine figures shall be better examined in a systematic wise here below.

=== Sancus as ===
The first part of the theonym defines the god as belonging to the category of the or , divine entities of the ancient Romans and Italics.
In a fragment from Cato, quoted in Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II 49 1‚Äì2), Sancus is referred to as and not .

In Rome this theonym is attested in the carmen Arvale (&quot;semunis alternei advocapit conctos&quot; repeated thrice) and in two fragmentary inscriptions: CIL V 567 &quot;Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio ... decur (ia) bidentalis donum dedit&quot; and CIL V 568 &quot;Sanco Sancto Semoni Deo Fidio sacrum decuria sacerdotum bidentalium&quot;
Outside Rome in Sabine, Umbrian and Pelignan territory: An inscription from Corfinium in Umbrian reads: , &#x27;priest of the √áerfi and the Semones&#x27;, placing side by side the two entities and . The are mentioned in the Iguvine Tables in association with Mars e.g. in expressions as . Their interpretation remains obscure: an etymological and semantic relation to PIE root , meaning &#x27;growth&#x27;, is possible though problematic and debated, since that root also means &quot;horn, head&quot; which would suggest a horned deity.

Also in Umbrian, in the Iguvine Tables, the b side of tablet II begins &quot;seminies tekuries&quot; which is interpreted to be a &quot;decurial [festival] to Semo...&quot; where a pig and goat sacrifice were performed, though the opening lines of this tablet are difficult to translate with certainty.

According to ancient Latin sources, the meaning of the term would denote (also explained as , men separated from ordinary ones, who have left their human condition: the prefix &quot;&quot; both in Latin and Greek may denote segregation), or the , i.e. gods of the second rank, or semigods,
entities that belong to the intermediate sphere between gods and men.
The relationship of these entities to is comparable to that of the to : as among the there is a , thus similarly among the there is a . The would then be a class of semigods, i.e. people who did not share the destiny of ordinary mortals even though they were not admitted to Heaven, such as Faunus, Priapus, Picus, the Silvani.
However, some scholars opine such a definition is wrong and the are spirits of nature, representing the generative power hidden in seeds (Latin &quot;semina&quot;).
In ancient times only offers of milk were allowed to the .

The deity Semonia bears characters that link her to the group of the , as is shown by Festus s.v. : when a citizen was put to death the custom was to sacrifice a lamb of two years () to Semonia to appease her and purify the community. Only thereafter could the head and property of the culprit be vowed to the appropriate god. That Semo Sancus received the same kind of cult and sacrifice is shown in the inscription (see figure in this article) now under the statue of the god reading .
The relationship between Sancus and the of the carmen Arvale remains obscure, even though some scholars opine that Semo Sancus and or would represent the core significance of this archaic theology. It has also been proposed to understand this relationship in the light of that between Vedic god Indra or his companion Trita ƒÄpya and the Maruts.
Norden (1939) proposed a Greek origin.

=== Sancus and Salus ===
The two gods were related in several ways. Their shrines () were very close to each other on two adjacent hilltops of the Quirinal, the and respectively.
Some scholars also claim some inscriptions to Sancus have been found on the .
Moreover, Salus is the first of the series of deities mentioned by Macrobius as related in their sacrality: , , , , &quot;Tutilina&quot;, who required the observance of a of the person who happened to utter their name. These deities were connected to the ancient agrarian cults of the valley of the Circus Maximus that remain quite mysterious.

The statue of Tanaquil placed in the shrine of Sancus was famed for containing remedies in its girdle which people came to collect, named .
As numerous statues of boys wear the apotropaic golden , &#x27;bubble&#x27; or &#x27;locket&#x27;, which contained remedies against envy, or the &quot;evil eye&quot;, Palmer (1994) remarked a connection between these and the of the statue of Tanaquil in the of Sancus.

Wissowa, Norden, and Latte write of a deity named who is though attested only in one inscription of year 1CE mentioning a in its last line (line seventeen). There is consensus among scholars that this line is a later addition and cannot be dated with certainty.
In other inscriptions Salus is never connected to Semonia.

=== Sancus Dius Fidius and Jupiter ===
The relationship between the two gods is certain as both are in charge of oath, are connected with clear daylight sky and can wield lightning bolts. This overlap of functional characters has generated confusion about the identity of Sancus Dius Fidius either among ancient and modern scholars, as Dius Fidius has sometimes been considered another theonym for Iupiter.
The autonomy of Semo Sancus from Jupiter and the fact that Dius Fidius is an alternate theonym designating Semo Sancus (and not Jupiter) is shown by the name of the correspondent Umbrian god &quot;Fisus Sansi&quot; which compounds the two constituent parts of &quot;Sancus&quot; and &quot;Dius Fidius&quot;: in Umbrian and Sabine is the exact correspondent of , as e.g. Sabine Clausus of Latin Claudius. But &quot;Sansi&quot;/Sa√ßi also occurs with &quot;Iupater&quot;, as well as alone, and with the Umbrian theonyms &quot;Fisovius&quot; and &quot;Vesticius.&quot;

The fact that Sancus as Iupiter is in charge of the observance of oaths, of the laws of hospitality and of loyalty (&quot;Fides&quot;) makes him a deity connected with the sphere and values of sovereignty, i.e. what Dum√©zil calls &quot;the first function&quot;.

Wissowa (1909, 1912) advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the &#x27;genius&#x27; of Jupiter. Fowler (1899) cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism, and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a &quot;Genius Iovius&quot;, as it appears from the Iguvine Tables; the concept of a &quot;genius&quot; of a deity is attested only in the imperial period.

Mommsen, Fowler, and Dum√©zil, among others, rejected the accountability of the tradition that ascribes a Sabine origin to the Roman cult of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, partly on linguistic grounds since the theonym is Latin and no mention or evidence of a Sabine is found near Rome, while the are attested in Latin in the carmen Arvale. In their view Sancus would be a deity who was shared by all ancient Italic peoples, whether Osco-Umbrian or Latino-Faliscan.

The details of the cult of Fisus Sancius at Iguvium and those of Fides at Rome,
such as the use of the , a piece of linen fabric covering the right hand of the officiant, and of the () or , sort of small bronze disc brought in the right hand by the offerant at Iguvium and also deposed in the temple of Semo Sancus in 329BCE after an affair of treason
confirm the parallelism.

Some aspects of the ritual of the oath for Dius Fidius, such as the proceedings under the open sky and/or in the of private residences and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, have suggested to romanist O. Sacchi the idea that the oath by Dius Fidius predated that for or , and should have its origin in prehistoric time rituals, when the was in the open air and defined by natural landmarks as e.g. the highest nearby tree.
Supporting this interpretation is the explanation of the theonym Sancus as meaning &quot;sky&quot; in Sabine given by Johannes Lydus, etymology that however is rejected by Dum√©zil and Briquel among others. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the first element of &quot;Ju-piter&quot; goes back to [Proto-Indo-European] *diƒìu- &quot;bright (sky),&quot; and that the cognate Indo-European deities of &quot;Jupiter&quot; (such as Old Norse &quot;Tyr&quot;) are also connected with oath keeping.

All the known details concerning Sancus connect him to the sphere of the , of oaths, of the respect of compacts and of their sanction, i.e. divine guarantee against their breach. These values are all proper to sovereign gods and common with Iuppiter (and with Mitra in Vedic religion).

=== Sancus and Hercules ===
Aelius Stilo&#x27;s interpretation of the theonym as is based partly on the interchangeability and alternation of letters &quot;d&quot; and &quot;l&quot; in Sabine, which might have rendered possible the reading of &quot;Dius Fidius&quot; as &quot;Dius Filius&quot;, i.e. Dios Kouros, partly on the function of guarantor of oaths that Sancus shared with Hercules: Wissowa called it a , while interpreting him as the genius () of Iupiter. who is rather critical of this interpretation of Wissowa&#x27;s.
Stilo&#x27;s interpretation in its linguistic aspect looks to be unsupported by the form of the theonym in the Iguvine Tables, where it appears as &quot;Fisus&quot; or &quot;Fisovius Sancius&quot;, a formula that includes the two component parts of the theonym.
This theonym is rooted in an ancient IE &quot;*&quot; and is formed on the root stem &quot;*&quot; which is common to Latin .

The connexion to Hercules looks to be much more substantial on theological grounds. Hercules, especially in ancient Italy, retained many archaic features of a founder deity and of a guarantor of good faith and loyalty. The relationship with Jupiter of the two characters could be considered analogous. Hence both some ancient scholars such as Varro and Macrobius and modern ones as Woodard (2006) consider them as one.

=== Sancus and Mars ===
At Iguvium Fisus, Sancius is associated to Mars in the ritual of the sacrifice at the (&#x27;Gate&#x27;) as one of the gods of the minor triad and this fact proves his military connection in Umbria. This might be explained by the military nature of the concept of &quot;sanction&quot; which implies the use of repression. The term too has in Roman law military implications: the walls of the city are .

The martial aspect of Sancus is highlighted also in the instance of the Samnite , a selected part of the army formed by noble soldiers bound by a set of particularly compelling oaths and put under the special protection of Iupiter. While ordinary soldiers dressed in a purple red paludamentum with golden paraphernalia, those of the dressed in white with silver paraphernalia, as an apparent show of their different allegiance and protector. This strict association of the ritual to Iupiter underlines the military aspect of the sovereign god that comes in to supplement the usual role of Mars on special occasions, i.e. when there is the need for the support of his power.

A prodigy related by Livy concerning an who broke a rainstone or meteorite fallen into a grove sacred to Mars at Crustumerium in 177BCE has also been seen by some scholars as a sign of a martial aspect of Sancus. Woodard has interpreted Sancus as the Roman equivalent of Vedic god Indra, who has to rely on the help of the Maruts, in his view corresponding to the twelfth Roman of the carmen Arvale, in his task of killing the dragon Vrtra thus freeing the waters and averting draught. He traces the etymology of &quot;Semo&quot; to PIE root * bearing the meanings of &#x27;to pour&#x27;, &#x27;ladle&#x27;, &#x27;flow&#x27;, &#x27;drop&#x27; related to rain and sowing.
 In Roman myth Hercules would represent this mythic character in his killing of the monster Cacus. Sancus would be identical to Hercules and strictly related, though not identical, to Mars as purported by the old cults of the Salii of Tibur related by Varro and other ancient authors cited by Macrobius. The tricephalous deity represented near Hercules in Etruscan tombs and reflected in the wise of the killing of Cacus would correspond to the features of the monster killed by Indra in association with Trita ƒÄpya.

The connection between Sancus and Mars can be further explained by the fact that Semo Sancus could be considered identical with the god Enyalius son of Mars (Ares); but sometimes Enyalius served also as an epithet of Ares (Mars) himself thus the two came to be regarded as very similar in character and their identities could overlap at times. Pirro Ligorio in the &quot;Codice Torinese&quot; reports the tradition about this god (Sancus) as found in the city of Rieti, populated by the Sabines and he writes as such: &quot;[‚Ä¶] Hoggid√¨ questa citt√† chiamano Rieti, et delle sue antichit√† si trova questa base rotonda nel mezzo della sua piazza, sopra la quale fu gi√† la statua di Sancte Sabinorum che √® il Genio detto Sango et alcuni il chiamano Genio altri Enialio figliuolo di Marte, alcuni vogliono che sia Hercole, altri Apolline [‚Ä¶]&quot; which translates as: &quot;Nowadays they call this city Rieti, and of its ancient artifacts this rounded base can be found in the center of its square, on top of which there was the statue of Sancte Sabinorum who is the Genius called Sangus and some call him Genius others Enyalios son of Mars, some claim he is Hercules, others Apollo [‚Ä¶]&quot;.

== Sancus in Etruria ==
As for Etruscan religion, N. Thomas De Grummond has suggested to identify Sancus in the inscription found on a unearthed near Bolsena; however, other scholars connect this epithet to a local family . The theonym found on bronze statues (one of a boy and that of the , &#x27;public speaker&#x27;) from the area near Cortona has been seen as an Etruscan form of the same theonym.

<doc id="85629" wikidata="Q465472" url="?curid=85629" title="Full House">
<text>Full House is an American television sitcom created by Jeff Franklin for ABC. The show is about widowed father Danny Tanner who enlists his brother-in-law Jesse Katsopolis and childhood best friend Joey Gladstone to help raise his three daughters, eldest Donna Jo Margaret (D.J. for short), middle child Stephanie and youngest Michelle in his San Francisco home. It originally aired from September 22, 1987, to May 23, 1995, with a total of eight seasons consisting of 192 episodes.

While never a critical success, the series was consistently in the Nielsen Top 30 (from season two onward) and continues to gain even more popularity in syndicated reruns, and is also aired internationally. One of the producers, Dennis Rinsler, called the show &quot;&quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; of the 1990s&quot;. For actor Dave Coulier, the show represented a &quot;G-rated dysfunctional family&quot;.

A sequel series, &quot;Fuller House&quot;, premiered on Netflix on February 26, 2016, and ran for five seasons, concluding on June 2, 2020.

==Plot==
After the death of his wife Pam, sports anchor Danny Tanner recruits his rock musician brother-in-law (Pam&#x27;s younger brother), Jesse Katsopolis, and stand-up comedian Joey Gladstone, his best friend since childhood, to help raise his three young daughters in San Francisco‚ÄîD.J., Stephanie, and Michelle. Over time, the three men, as well as the girls, bond and become closer to one another.

In season two, Danny is reassigned from his duties as a sports anchor by his television station to become co-host of the morning show, &quot;Wake Up, San Francisco&quot;, and is teamed up with Nebraska native Rebecca Donaldson. Jesse and Rebecca (&quot;Becky&quot;) eventually fall in love and get married in season four. In season five, Becky gives birth to twin sons, Nicholas (&quot;Nicky&quot;) and Alexander (&quot;Alex&quot;).

==Main cast==

* John Stamos as Jesse Katsopolis
* Bob Saget as Danny Tanner
* Dave Coulier as Joey Gladstone
* Candace Cameron as D.J. Tanner
* Jodie Sweetin as Stephanie Tanner
* Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as Michelle Tanner (seasons 2‚Äì8; recurring season 1)
* Lori Loughlin as Rebecca Donaldson Katsopolis (seasons 3‚Äì8; recurring season 2)
* Andrea Barber as Kimmy Gibbler (seasons 5‚Äì8; recurring seasons 1‚Äì4)
* Scott Weinger as Steve Hale (seasons 6‚Äì7; guest seasons 5 and 8)
* Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit as Nicky and Alex Katsopolis (seasons 6‚Äì8; recurring season 5)

==Production==

===Casting===

The producers&#x27; first choice to play the character of Danny Tanner was Bob Saget. Saget was not available to appear in the pilot due to his commitment as an on-air contributor to CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Program&quot;. The producers instead cast actor John Posey to play Danny. Posey only appeared in the show&#x27;s unaired pilot; which is included on the DVD release of Season 1.

John Stamos&#x27;s character was originally named Jesse Cochran; Stamos reportedly wanted his character to better reflect his Greek heritage, so producers decided to change the character&#x27;s surname to Katsopolis (beginning with season two).

To comply with child labor laws, twins Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle during tapings. The girls were jointly credited as &quot;Mary Kate Ashley Olsen&quot; in seasons two through seven because the producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. The sisters occasionally appeared together in fantasy sequences. &quot;Full House&quot; was one of the few shows on TV where a baby character grew up in front of the cameras, with viewers witnessing all the development stages of the twin actresses. Saget recalled he would often get complaints from the child actors&#x27; moms because he wouldn&#x27;t watch his language while on stage. Jodie Sweetin was spotted in a guest spot on the show &quot;Valerie&quot;. Lori Loughlin was hired in 1988 for a six-episode romance plot with Uncle Jesse but ended up staying until the end of the show.

All seven of the original cast members remained with the show through its entire eight-year run, with five characters added to the main cast along the way. D.J. (Candace Cameron)&#x27;s best friend Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber) was a recurring character in seasons one through four, who was upgraded to a regular in season five. Loughlin&#x27;s character Rebecca Donaldson originally appeared for six episodes in season two; producers decided to expand her role and made her a regular the following season. After marrying Jesse, they have twins Nicky and Alex, who make their debut in season five. As babies, the children were played by Daniel and Kevin Renteria, and in season six, the roles of the twins were succeeded by Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit. The last main character added was Steve Hale, who was D.J.&#x27;s boyfriend in seasons six and seven. He was played by Scott Weinger.

===Taping===
The series was created by Jeff Franklin and executive produced by Franklin, along with Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. The series was produced by Jeff Franklin Productions and Miller-Boyett Productions, in association with Lorimar-Telepictures (1987‚Äì1988), Lorimar Television (1988‚Äì1993), and then by Warner Bros. Television (1993‚Äì1995) after Lorimar was folded into Warner Bros.&#x27; existing television production division.

Although the series was set in San Francisco, the sitcom itself was taped at the Warner Bros. Studios in Los Angeles. Outside of certain excerpts in the opening title sequences, including Alamo Square Park&#x27;s Painted Ladies, the only episode to have actually been taped in San Francisco was the first episode of season eight, &quot;Comet&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. There were also a few episodes which were filmed on-location elsewhere, most notably Hawaii in the season three premiere &quot;Tanner&#x27;s Island&quot;, and at Walt Disney World for the two-part sixth-season finale &quot;The House Meets the Mouse&quot;.

The series experienced heavy turnover with its writing staff throughout its run. The first season in particular had at least three writing staff changes, with Lenny Ripps (who remained with the show until the early part of the fourth season, by then serving as a creative consultant) and Russell Marcus being the only writers surviving the changes through the entire season. Show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin was the only writer to remain with the series throughout its entire eight-season run (Franklin also wrote and directed several episodes during the first five seasons). Marc Warren and Dennis Rinsler joined the series&#x27; writing staff in the second season as producers and remained with the show until its 1995 cancellation; Warren and Rinsler took over as head writers by season five and assumed showrunning duties as executive producers for the sixth season to allow Franklin to focus on &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; (&quot;Full House&quot; served as &quot;Cooper&quot;‚Ä≥s lead-in when the former aired on Tuesday nights during the 1992‚Äì93 season).

===Theme song===
The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Everywhere You Look&quot;, was performed by Jesse Frederick, who co-wrote the song with writing partner Bennett Salvay and series creator Jeff Franklin. Various instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits; the version used during seasons three through eight was also used in the opening credits in some early syndication runs, although the song was almost always truncated to the chorus for broadcast. Seasons one through five used a longer version of the theme song. In syndicated airings, the line &quot;you miss your old familiar friends, but waiting just around the bend&quot; replaced the lines starting with &quot;how did I get to livin&#x27; here, somebody tell me please...&quot; (after ABC Family acquired the series in 2003, it became the first television outlet to air the long versions of the theme since the series&#x27; ABC run, which were included only in select episodes from the first five seasons, whereas the full version was used in most episodes during those seasons). Hallmark Channel reruns have used four different cuts of the theme song, including the full version.

===Cross-marketing===
ABC used the show to launch other family sitcom hits throughout the early 1990s on Fridays and other evenings such as &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;.

The actor Dave Coulier sold the Mr. Woodchuck puppet he made on the show to the toy store Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

==Episodes and ratings==

&quot;Full House&quot; originally aired on Fridays from September 1987 to August 1991, which spanned the show&#x27;s first four seasons, and later became the flagship program of ABC&#x27;s newly launched TGIF block in September 1989. The show was briefly moved to Tuesdays during the 1987‚Äì88 season and then aired twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays for a few months in order to help the series build an audience. It remained on Fridays permanently for the next three seasons, as the show&#x27;s ratings increased. &quot;Full House&quot; was moved to Tuesdays full-time for season five and remained there until the series ended in 1995. While the show&#x27;s first season was not very successful, finishing 71st that year, mostly because it was a new series placed in an 8 p.m. Eastern timeslot (most freshman series start out in protected time slots preceded by successful lead-ins), the show quickly became popular during its second season as it was placed immediately following the established hit show &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (which was also produced by Tom Miller and Bob Boyett). From season three onwards, it was ranked among Nielsen&#x27;s Top 30 shows (a ratings increase which allowed the series to move back to Fridays at 8 p.m.). By the fourth season, the series jumped to the Top 20 and remained there until the seventh season (the series peaked at the top ten during seasons five and six).

In 1995, despite the fact the show was still rated in the top 25, ABC announced that it was canceling the show after eight seasons due to the increasing costs of producing the series. By the end of the show, the average cost of one episode was $1.3 million. Plans to move &quot;Full House&quot; to The WB network fell through. The one-hour series finale was watched by 24.3 million viewers, ranking No. 7 for the week and attracting a 14.6 household rating and a 25 percent audience share.

==U.S. syndication==
Warner Bros. Television Distribution handles the domestic and international syndication rights to the series. During the summer of 1991, reruns of the early seasons began airing in a daily daytime strip on NBC. Starting in September 1991, Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution began distributing &quot;Full House&quot; for broadcast in off-network syndication and was syndicated on various local stations nationwide until 2003.

The series previously aired on TBS, WGN America, Nick at Nite, ABC Family (now FreeForm), TV Land, The N/TeenNick, CMT, and Hallmark Channel.

In 2014, episodes have averaged 1.5 million viewers on Nick at Nite, which is up 7 percent from 2013 and a 0.4 rating in the key 18‚Äì49 demographic, up 8 percent from 2013.

On September 29, 2017, Hulu acquired the streaming rights to &quot;Full House&quot; along with fellow Warner Bros. Television productions &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot; in addition to Disney-ABC Domestic Television productions &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Home Improvement&quot;.

On October 1, 2021, &quot;Full House&quot; began streaming on HBO Max after its streaming rights expired from Hulu.

On January 12, 2022, the show began airing on the classic TV network MeTV, moving to sister network Catchy Comedy the following year.

Since 2022, the show has aired (intermittently) on GAC Family.

==Critical reception==

Despite the show&#x27;s popularity and being an &#x27;80s-&#x27;90s classic among audiences and families, critics&#x27; reviews for &quot;Full House&quot; were mostly mixed to negative in the show&#x27;s early years, but became somewhat more positive in later years. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the show&#x27;s first season has an approval rating of 40% based on 5 critical reviews. On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the first season holds an aggregate score of 31 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; while it holds a score of 7.6 based on 157 user reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In &quot;Slate&quot;, Willa Paskin referred to the series as &quot;a hackneyed and saccharine family sitcom&quot;. Isaac Feldberg opined that it was &quot;archetypally average, hiding behind a ubiquitous laugh track and obnoxiously on-the-nose life lessons.&quot; Howard Rosenberg of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; mocked it as &quot;not playing with a full deck. It oozes and blubbers for a half hour, yielding no laughs or life. You need a Geiger counter to detect its pulse.&quot; He added: &quot;It strives to beat out CBS for second place in the ratings. But this contrived muck isn&#x27;t one of them. In fact, its entire premise of shared witless fatherhood (a la &quot;My Two Dads&quot; on NBC) is a great argument for birth control.&quot; 

John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;And so it goes, one predictable situation following another, with the actors frantically trying to keep the patient [the infant] from becoming a full-fledged corpse.&quot; 

Josh Kurp of &quot;Uproxx&quot; described the show as &quot;comfortingly bland. . . . a bowl of white rice, spaghetti with no butter or sauce, eggs served on Saltines. You could live off it... but you wouldn&#x27;t want to.&quot;

Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; defended it: &quot;Critics are supposed to rend teeth and gnash clothing when a show like &quot;Full House&quot; catches on, but why? The new ABC sitcom seems to follow at least one basic, if often ignored, rule of television: First, do no harm.&quot; 

Josh Jackson wrote in a positive review: &quot;&quot;Full House&quot;: The absolute definition of the &#x27;family sitcom&#x27; in the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s. Unlike the &quot;Blossoms&quot; of the era, &quot;Full House&quot; wasn&#x27;t about the &#x27;very special episode&#x27;; it was just wholesome, family friendly entertainment all the time, which has become all the more humorous in the years that followed as former viewers learned just how foul-mouthed Bob Saget could be in literally any other context. This, though, was the television equivalent of cotton candy: airy, saccharine, and totally insubstantial. Even if you watched a ton of &quot;Full House&quot; episodes, I&#x27;ll bet you barely remember the full plot of any of them.&quot;

==Reunions==
During Bob Saget&#x27;s final season as host of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, six other &quot;Full House&quot; cast alumni (John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, and Lori Loughlin) reunited on the May 9, 1997, episode (the episode which preceded Saget&#x27;s final episode as host of that series).

In a December 2008 news story, it was reported that John Stamos was planning a reunion movie. This idea was quickly withdrawn, because reportedly most of the cast was not interested. In 2009, Stamos announced that a feature film based on the show was still planned. Stamos told &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m working on a movie idea, but it wouldn&#x27;t be us playing us. I&#x27;m not 100% sure, but it would probably take place in the first few years.&quot; Stamos posited Steve Carell and Tracy Morgan for the roles of Danny and Joey respectively.

In 2012, eight of the &quot;Full House&quot; cast members reunited in Los Angeles for their 25th anniversary. Publicists for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen said that they &quot;weren&#x27;t able to attend, given their work schedules.&quot;

On July 19, 2013, the original Jesse and the Rippers (the band which Jesse Katsopolis served as frontman until he was voted out in season 8) reunited on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The group performed a medley of covers including the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Forever&quot;, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Little Sister&quot;, &quot;Hippy Hippy Shake&quot;, and ending with the &quot;Full House&quot; theme &quot;Everywhere You Look&quot;. Bob Saget and Lori Loughlin made cameo appearances.

In January 2014, Saget, Stamos, and Coulier appeared on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. They each reprised their characters, while Fallon dressed in child&#x27;s pajamas in a bed framed by four gigantic pencils, similar to Michelle Tanner&#x27;s bed from the show. Saget, Stamos, and Coulier said some of their famous catchphrases from the show, as well as singing &quot;The Teddy Bear&quot; song. Stamos, Saget and Coulier also appeared together in a 2014 commercial for Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt (for which Stamos serves as spokesperson) that debuted during Super Bowl XLVIII, days after their appearance on &quot;Late Night&quot;.

===Sequel series===

In August 2014, reports circulated that Warner Bros. Television was considering a series sequel. John Stamos, who has an ownership stake in the show, headed up the attempt to get the series back into production. Netflix closed a deal to produce a 13-episode sequel series tentatively titled &quot;Fuller House&quot;, with many of the original series cast members reprising their roles. Notably, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen both declined to reprise the role of Michelle in the first season, although the creators and producers said they could still possibly appear in future seasons. Stamos would guest star as well and serve as producer.

Filming began on July 25, 2015. Like the original series, the show is set in San Francisco. The original series idea was focused on D.J., a veterinarian struggling to raise three boys Jackson (Michael Campion), Max (Elias Harger) and Tommy Jr. (Dashiell and Fox Messitt) after her firefighter husband Tommy Fuller is killed in the line of duty; Stephanie, an aspiring musician; and Kimmy, who is a party planner and a single mother to a teenage daughter, Ramona (Soni Nicole Bringas). The show&#x27;s premise follows one similar to the original series when Stephanie makes plans to put her career on hold for a while and move in with D.J. to help take care of her children. Almost immediately afterward, Kimmy makes the same offer for her and Ramona to move in and help out. Netflix premiered the series on February 26, 2016, with the premiere episode featuring a Tanner family reunion. After five seasons, the series concluded on June 2, 2020.

==Other media==

===Home media===

Warner Home Video released all eight seasons of the series on DVD in Region 1 between 2005 and 2007. A complete series box-set containing all 192 episodes was released on November 6, 2007. As of 2016, the complete series is available for purchase via online retailers such as Amazon. Additionally, all seasons + the complete series were also released in Region 4 but only the first five seasons were released on DVD in Region 2 with the fifth season being sold solely on Amazon and printed on DVD¬±R-Discs only.

All Seasons of &quot;Full House&quot; are available on Amazon Prime Video in various countries and with different languages.

===Book series===

Books based on &quot;Full House&quot; are geared toward children primarily between the ages of 8 and 14. Warner Bros., which holds the rights to &quot;Full House&quot; and its associated characters, would not permit others to use their characters and selected who could write books based on the television series. The books are based on the &quot;Silhouette&quot; romance novels by Mills &amp; Boon. &quot;Full House Michelle #7: Summer Rhapsody&quot; is a Silhouette Special Edition #75 by Nancy John and Laura O&#x27;Neil in February 1983.

The series includes the following:
* &quot;Full House Stephanie&quot;: These 33 books were written from the point of view of the Tanners&#x27; middle daughter, Stephanie Tanner. They take place with Stephanie in a different middle school, likely because of a slightly different redistricting plan compared to the one mentioned in season seven&#x27;s &quot;Fast Friends&quot;. She has different best friends as well, Allie Taylor and Darcy Powell. Though these are book creations, she has known Allie since kindergarten, and there are several places in the first five seasons of &quot;Full House&quot; where fans think an unnamed extra could be Allie. This series begins with Stephanie being pressured to join a clique called the Flamingos, by completing a series of dares. She almost does the last one, though she is not sure if she wants to before D.J. catches her trying to steal Danny&#x27;s phone card. Stephanie explains tearfully what was happening, and D.J. helps her to understand what the Flamingos were really up to: they wanted to use the phone card to call their boyfriends. Stephanie and the Flamingos become fierce rivals. &quot;Hip Hop Till You Drop&quot;, &quot;Two for One Christmas Fun&quot;, and &quot;Ten Ways to Wreck a Date&quot; are the most popular.
* &quot;Full House Michelle&quot;: These 40 stories are told from Michelle&#x27;s point of view. The first 27 feature more of her, and the other Tanners&#x27;, home life than others, though some focus on events at school, whereas the last 14, the &quot;Michelle and Friends&quot; series, focuses mostly on Michelle and her classmates. Unlike Stephanie, Michelle goes to the same elementary school but is in a different class. Two stories were translated and published in Japan in February 2007. Super special &quot;My Best Friend is a Movie Star&quot; came out in September 1996, and along with &quot;The Substitute Teacher&quot; and &quot;How to be Cool&quot; are the most popular.
* &quot;Full House Sisters&quot;: These 14 books focus on Michelle and Stephanie&#x27;s friendship and comical situations that occur between them. The sisters often alternate points of view in the story.
* &quot;Full House: Dear Michelle&quot;: These four books were published several years after the others stopped being produced. They take place with Michelle in the third grade, where she writes an advice column for her class paper.
* &quot;Club Stephanie&quot;: 1997‚Äì2001 revival series with Stephanie and her friends.

===Russian adaptation===
In 2006, &quot;Full House&quot; was one of a group of Warner Brothers properties licensed to Moscow-based network STS for adaptation to Russian. The show, &quot;Topsy-Turvy House&quot; (–î–æ–º –∫—É–≤—ã—Ä–∫–æ–º) followed the plots of the American version with changes to accommodate cultural differences. It ran for two seasons, beginning in 2009.

=== &quot;The Unauthorized Full House Story&quot; ===
On August 22, 2015, a television movie called &quot;The Unauthorized Full House Story&quot; was first released by Lifetime. It tells the behind-the-scenes story of the series.

<text>In Roman mythology, Sergestus was a Trojan friend of Aeneas. He was the ancestor of gens Sergia, a famous Patrician family of which Catilina was a member. Hence he is also the ultimate namesake of the given names Sergey, Sergio, etc.

== Mythology ==
In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, after the boat race during Anchises&#x27; Funeral games Aeneas gives to Sergestus a Cretan slave girl named Pholoe in gratitude for saving both ship and crew, after he ran aground. This is one of the examples of Aeneas showing his fair and compassionate nature, as despite the fact Sergestus comes last in the boat race he still receives a prize.

Sergestus also appears as a minor character in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Dido, Queen of Carthage&quot;.
