<text>Wag the Dog is a 1997 American black comedy political satire film starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. Produced and directed by Barry Levinson, the film centers on a spin doctor and a Hollywood producer who fabricate a war in Albania to distract voters from a presidential sex scandal. The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart&#x27;s 1993 novel, &quot;American Hero&quot;.

The title of the film comes from the English-language idiom &quot;&quot;, used to indicate attention that is purposely being diverted from something of greater importance to something of lesser.

&quot;Wag the Dog&quot; was released one month before the news broke of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan by the Clinton administration in August 1998, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality. The comparison was also made in December 1998, when the administration initiated a bombing campaign of Iraq during Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial for the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. It was made again in spring 1999, when the administration intervened in the Kosovo War and initiated a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, which, coincidentally, bordered Albania and contained ethnic Albanians.

The film grossed $64.3 million on a $15 million budget, and was well received by critics, who praised the direction, performances, themes and humor. Hoffman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, and screenwriters David Mamet and Hilary Henkin were both nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Plot==
The President of the United States is caught making advances on an underage girl inside the Oval Office less than two weeks before the election. Conrad Brean, a top spin doctor, is brought in by presidential aide Winifred Ames to take the public&#x27;s attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a fleeing orphan to arouse sympathy. The hoax is initially successful, with the president quickly gaining ground in the polls.

When the CIA learns of the plot, it sends Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his and the CIA&#x27;s best interests. But when the CIA — in collusion with the president&#x27;s rival candidate — reports that the war has ended, the media begins to focus back on the president&#x27;s sexual misconduct scandal. To counter this, Motss invents a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania.

Inspired by the idea that he was &quot;discarded like an old shoe&quot;, Brean and Motss ask the Pentagon to provide a special forces soldier with a matching name (a sergeant named &quot;Schumann&quot; is identified), around whom a POW narrative can be constructed. As part of the hoax, folk singer Johnny Dean records a song called &quot;Old Shoe&quot;, which is pressed onto a 78 rpm record, prematurely aged so that listeners will think it was recorded years earlier, and sent to the Library of Congress to be &quot;found&quot;. Bream and Motss fling pairs of old shoes into a tree outside the White House grounds. Soon, large numbers begin appearing on phone and power lines, and a grassroots movement to bring Schumann home takes hold, completing a successful astroturfing.

When the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally insane Army convict. On the way back their plane crashes en route to Andrews Air Force Base. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, an illegal alien. However, Schumann is killed when he attempts to rape a gas station owner&#x27;s daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming he died from wounds sustained during his rescue, and the farmer receives expedited citizenship for a better story.

As the President rallies toward re-election Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting his upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of &quot;Don&#x27;t change horses in mid-stream&quot; rather than to Motss&#x27; hard work. Despite Brean&#x27;s offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is &quot;playing with his life&quot;, Motss demands he receive credit for his production and will reveal his involvement unless he gets it. Realizing he has no choice, Brean orders his security staff to kill him. A newscast reports that Motss has died of a heart attack at home, the president has been successfully re-elected, and an Albanian terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for a recent bombing, suggesting the fake war is becoming real.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Title===
The title of the film comes from the English-language idiom &quot;&quot;, which is referenced at the beginning of the film by a caption that reads:

===Motss portrayal===
Hoffman&#x27;s character, Stanley Motss, is said to have been based directly on famed producer Robert Evans. Similarities have been noted between the character and Evans&#x27;s work habits, mannerisms, quirks, clothing style, hairstyle and large, square-framed eyeglasses. In fact, the real Evans is said to have joked, &quot;I&#x27;m magnificent in this film&quot;.

While Hoffman has never discussed deriving his portrayal from Evans, the commentary track for the film&#x27;s DVD release makes the claim.

===Writing credits===
Writing credits for the film became controversial due to objections by Barry Levinson. After Levinson became attached as director, David Mamet was hired to rewrite Hilary Henkin&#x27;s screenplay, which was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart&#x27;s novel, &quot;American Hero&quot;.

Given the close relationship between Levinson and Mamet, New Line Cinema asked that Mamet be given sole credit for the screenplay. However, the Writers Guild of America intervened on Henkin&#x27;s behalf to ensure that Henkin received first-position shared screenplay credit, finding that, as the original screenwriter, Henkin had created the screenplay&#x27;s structure, as well as much of the screen story and dialogue.

Levinson threatened to quit the Guild (but he did not), claiming that Mamet had written all of the dialogue, as well as creating the characters of Motss and Schumann, and had originated most of the scenes set in Hollywood, and all of the scenes set in Nashville. Levinson attributed the numerous similarities between Henkin&#x27;s original version and the eventual shooting script to Henkin and Mamet working from the same novel, but the Writers Guild of America disagreed in its credit arbitration ruling.

==Music==

The film features many songs created for the fictitious campaign waged to deflect the President’s sex scandal. These include &quot;Good Old Shoe&quot;, &quot;The American Dream&quot; and &quot;The Men of the 303&quot;. However, the film’s soundtrack CD features only the title track (by British guitarist and vocalist Mark Knopfler) and seven of Knopfler&#x27;s instrumentals.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review Roger Ebert awarded the film four stars of four, and wrote in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;The movie is a satire that contains just enough realistic ballast to be teasingly plausible; like &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, it makes you laugh, and then it makes you wonder.&quot; He ranked it as his tenth favorite film of 1997.

In 2020, Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; rated it at number 12 on her list of the best political movies ever made.

&quot;Wag the Dog&quot; has an approval rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Smart, well-acted, and uncomfortably prescient political satire from director Barry Levinson and an all-star cast.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating, the film holds a score of 74 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Wag the Dog&quot; was released on VHS November 3, 1998, and on DVD November 15, 2005. It is not available on Blu-ray.

<text>Walter Clement Pipp Sr. (February 17, 1893 – January 11, 1965) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, Pipp played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, and Cincinnati Reds between 1913 and 1928.

After appearing in 12 games for the Tigers in 1913 and playing in the minor leagues in 1914, he was purchased by the Yankees before the 1915 season. They made him their starting first baseman. He and Home Run Baker led an improved Yankee lineup that led the league in home runs. He led the American League in home runs in 1916 and 1917. With Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, and Waite Hoyt, the Yankees won three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and won the 1923 World Series. In 1925, he lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig, after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati.

Although he is considered to be one of the best power hitters of the dead ball era, Pipp is now best remembered as the man who lost his starting role as the Yankees&#x27; first baseman to Gehrig on June 2, 1925, after experiencing a headache. This began Gehrig&#x27;s streak of 2,130 consecutive games played, which stood as an MLB record for 56 years.

==Early life==
Walter Pipp was born on February 17, 1893, in Chicago, Illinois. His mother Pauline (&quot;née&quot; Stroeber) came to the US from Germany at a young age with her parents. His father, William H. Pipp, was the son of immigrants from Germany that married in Michigan. He was raised as a Roman Catholic in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As a child, Pipp said that he was hit in the head with a hockey puck, which resulted in headaches throughout his life.

Pipp enrolled at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he studied architecture and played baseball for the Catholic University Cardinals. Pipp graduated in 1913.

==Baseball career==

===Early career===
In 1912, Pipp made his debut in professional baseball with the Kalamazoo Celery Pickers of the Class D level Southern Michigan League. In 68 games played, he had a .270 batting average. The Detroit Tigers of the American League purchased his contract late in the 1912 season. Pipp attempted to hold out from the Tigers, demanding a portion of the purchase price, and threatened to return to college.

After graduating from college, Pipp ended his holdout without receiving a share of the purchase price. Pipp made his major league debut with the Tigers on June 29, 1913. After playing 12 games for Detroit, batting .161, the Tigers reassigned Pipp to the Providence Grays of the Class AA International League. He committed seven errors in 14 games for Providence, and was demoted to the Scranton Miners of the Class B New York State League, where he only batted .220.

In 1914, Pipp played for the Rochester Hustlers of the International League. Pipp had a .314 batting average and 27 triples. He led all batters in the league with 15 home runs, a .526 slugging percentage, and 290 total bases.

===New York Yankees===
In January 1915, Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L&#x27;Hommedieu Huston agreed to purchase the New York Yankees of the American League. As part of the agreement, the other team owners in the American League agreed to help the Yankees restock their system with prospects. One of the deals Ruppert and Huston negotiated was their purchase of Pipp. After Ruppert and Huston completed the purchase of the team, the other American League owners, with the exception of Frank Navin, the owner of the Tigers, broke their word. On February 4, 1915, the Tigers sold Pipp and outfielder Hugh High to the Yankees, receiving $5,000 for each player ($ in current dollar terms).
The Yankees had struggled prior to Ruppert and Huston&#x27;s purchase, having only one winning record in their previous eight seasons. They made Pipp their starting first baseman in time for Opening Day of the 1915 season. The Yankees added Home Run Baker in 1916, and they formed the center of the Yankees&#x27; batting order. Pipp led the American League in home runs with 12 in 1916; Baker finished second with 10. Pipp hit nine home runs in 1917, again leading the league.

In 1918, Pipp hit only two home runs, but batted .304. He missed playing time under the nation&#x27;s &quot;work or fight&quot; rule during World War I; he worked as a naval aviation cadet at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He batted .275 with seven home runs in 1919, as Babe Ruth surpassed him as the best power hitter in the American League. The Yankees moved to strengthen their team after the 1919 season, adding Ruth and fellow outfielder Bob Meusel and third baseman Joe Dugan. Between 1920 and 1924, Pipp had a .301 average, with season averages of 29 doubles, 94 runs scored, and 97 runs batted in (RBI) per season. Led by their strong lineup and additions to the pitching staff, such as Waite Hoyt, the Yankees finished in second place in 1920. Pipp became the cleanup hitter, behind Ruth in the batting order. Pipp hit .296 in 1921, and the Yankees won the American League pennant. However, they lost the 1921 World Series to the crosstown rival New York Giants of the National League.

On July 26, 1922, Pipp bobbled a ball during the fifth inning of a game against the St. Louis Browns. When the Yankees returned to the dugout, Ruth criticized Pipp&#x27;s fielding. Pipp attacked Ruth, and the two were separated by teammates. Though Ruth insisted they&#x27;d &quot;settle this after the game&quot;, Ruth and Pipp led the Yankees to a victory with their hitting, and when Pipp approached Ruth after the game, ready to fight, Ruth opted against it. Pipp said this resulted in reduced tension among the Yankees, to which he attributed their improved play from that point forward. Pipp batted .329 in 1922 and the Yankees again won the American League pennant. In a rematch, the Giants again defeated the Yankees in the 1922 World Series. Meanwhile, Pipp scouted Lou Gehrig, who was playing college baseball for Columbia University, and suggested to Miller Huggins, the Yankees&#x27; manager, that he should sign Gehrig. Pipp personally helped develop Gehrig after he signed. Pipp had a strong 1923 season, but injured his right ankle while stepping down from a train in Boston late in the year. The Yankees used Gehrig, whom they promoted from the minor leagues, to play in four games at first base replacing Pipp, before calling upon Babe Ruth to substitute at first base for the four games at the very end of the season. Though Huggins initially thought Pipp would not be able to play in the 1923 World Series, Pipp recovered sufficiently in time to play. The Yankees won the series in six games over the Giants. The Yankees finished in second place in the American League in 1924, and Pipp led the league with 114 RBIs and 19 triples.

====1925: Removal from the Yankees&#x27; starting lineup====

The Yankees began the 1925 season struggling, and Huggins began to replace players in his lineup in response. Huggins benched starting shortstop Everett Scott on May 6, replacing him with Pee Wee Wanninger. At the time, Scott had the longest streak of consecutive games played, with 1,307. The Yankees continued to struggle. The Yankees entered play on June 2 on a five-game losing streak. Their 15–26 win–loss record had them in seventh place out of the eight teams in the American League, half a game better than the last place team, and games out of first place in the standings. Before their game against the Washington Senators, Huggins replaced Pipp in the Yankees&#x27; lineup with Gehrig, and benched second baseman Aaron Ward and catcher Wally Schang as well. Pipp was batting .244 with only three home runs and 23 RBIs, and had a .181 batting average over the previous three weeks. This was the second—not the first—game of Gehrig&#x27;s then-record 2,130 consecutive games played, which lasted for 14 seasons. The streak started the previous day, as on June 1 Gehrig entered the game as a pinch hitter, substituting for shortstop Wanninger.

Although Pipp&#x27;s replacement on June 2, 1925, was historic, and Gehrig had a great game by getting three hits, Gehrig would in fact go 0 for 3 in each of his next two games, before being lifted for a pinch-hitter each day. Pipp would finish both of those games defensively at first base.

According to the most popular version of the story, Pipp showed up at Yankee Stadium that day with a severe headache, and asked the team&#x27;s trainer for two aspirin. Miller Huggins, the Yankees&#x27; manager, noticed this, and said &quot;Wally, take the day off. We&#x27;ll try that kid Gehrig at first today and get you back in there tomorrow.&quot; Gehrig played well and became the Yankees&#x27; new starting first baseman. This story first appeared in a 1939 &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; on Gehrig&#x27;s career, in which Pipp was interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, &quot;I took the two most expensive aspirin in history.&quot;

According to &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, the 1942 film about Gehrig&#x27;s life, Pipp asked out of the game because he was experiencing double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp&#x27;s benching.

The &quot;New York Sun&quot; reported the benching was due to Pipp&#x27;s struggles against left-handed pitchers, as southpaw George Mogridge was the scheduled starting pitcher for the Senators on June 2. Other sources suggest Yankee manager Miller Huggins may have actually benched Pipp and other veterans in order to &quot;shake up&quot; the slumping lineup. According to another story, supported by Gehrig&#x27;s wife, Pipp was not at the game on June 2 because he was gambling on horse racing at a race track. His son Thomas denied this rumor, stating that his father never bet on horses. When interviewed by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Pipp&#x27;s own children disagreed on the reason for their father&#x27;s benching, believing it was either due to Pipp being beaned or struggling. Thomas believed Pipp told Huggins to play Gehrig in his place, as he knew Gehrig had a future with the Yankees, while he likely did not. According to a popular legend, Pipp asked to sit due to a headache. The story was confirmed by Thomas and by Bill Werber.

===Later career===
Ruth had returned to the Yankees&#x27; lineup on June 1, the day before Pipp, Ward, and Schang were benched. Despite Ruth&#x27;s return and the strong play of Gehrig, who batted .295 with 20 home runs and 68 RBIs, the Yankees finished in seventh place. Pipp was hospitalized for a week after being hit in the head by Caldwell on July 2, and he played sparingly during the remainder of the season. He ended the year with a .230 average, three home runs, and 24 RBIs.
Due to the team&#x27;s struggles, Huggins made personnel changes during the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, but could not agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who had not had a strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead. Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion of the purchase price, but was rebuffed.

Pipp played 372 games for the Reds over the next three seasons. In 1926, he had a .291 batting average, and his 99 RBIs and 15 triples were both fourth-best in the National League. He batted .260 with 41 RBIs in 1927, and .283 in 1928.

With first baseman George Kelly also on their roster, the Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season. Pipp signed with the Newark Bears of the International League for the season. He earned $40,000 ($ in current dollar terms) that year, more than he made during his major league career. He batted .312 for Newark, and retired after the season.

Pipp played 1,872 games. He had three seasons with a .300+ batting average, and two seasons with 100 or more RBI. Pipp had a .281 career batting average. He led both the American and National leagues in fielding percentage. His 226 sacrifices as a Yankee remain a team record. Pipp was the first Yankee to lead the American League in home runs. Due to his famous replacement by Gehrig, players began to say they were &quot;Wally Pipped&quot; when replaced in a lineup, especially if it is due to a minor injury.

==Later life==
Pipp often attended Old-Timers&#x27; Day at Yankee Stadium and Tiger Stadium, playing in 12 Old-Timers&#x27; games. He was later hired by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as one of the magazine&#x27;s first writers.

After retiring, Pipp invested in the stock market, but lost his wealth in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. He authored a book, titled &quot;Buying Cheap and Selling Dear&quot;. He worked as a broadcaster on a pregame baseball show for the Tigers, wrote radio scripts, and worked in publishing. He organized baseball programs around his community for the National Youth Administration. He also spent time unemployed during the Great Depression. In 1940, Pipp was on the verge of bankruptcy, but he managed to pay off his debts without going bankrupt.

During World War II, Pipp worked at the Willow Run manufacturing complex in Ypsilanti, building B-24 bombers. Following the war, Pipp worked for the Rockford Screw Products Corporation as a machine parts salesman, selling bolts and screws to automotive companies based in Detroit and Grand Rapids.

==Personal life==
Pipp and his wife, Nora, had four children: three sons (Walter, Tom, and Wally Jr.) and a daughter (Dorothy). Pipp&#x27;s brother, the Reverend W.B. Pipp, was a Catholic priest and golfer.

The Pipps moved to Lansing, Michigan, in 1949. After suffering a number of strokes, Pipp moved to a nursing home in Grand Rapids in September 1963. He died there on January 11, 1965, of a heart attack at the age of 71. He is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Grand Rapids.

<text>Commercial vehicle operations (CVO) is an application of intelligent transportation systems for trucks. It would allow trucks and buses to travel without having to stop for weight, credential, and safety checks, by using highway sensors to check them automatically as they are driven at prevailing speeds.

A typical system would be purchased by the managers of a trucking company. It would have a satellite navigation system, a small computer and a digital radio in each truck. Every fifteen minutes the computer transmits where the truck has been. The digital radio service forwards the data to the central office of the trucking company. A computer system in the central office manages the fleet in real time under control of a team of dispatchers.

In this way, the central office knows where its trucks are. The company tracks individual loads by using barcoded containers and pallets to track loads combined into a larger container. To minimize handling-expense, damage and waste of vehicle capacity, optimal-sized pallets are often constructed at distribution points to go to particular destinations.

A good load-tracking system will help deliver more than 95% of its loads via truck, on planned schedules. If a truck gets off its route, or is delayed, the truck can be diverted to a better route, or urgent loads that are likely to be late can be diverted to air freight. This allows a trucking company to deliver a true premium service at only slightly higher cost. The best proprietary systems, such as the one operated by FedEx, achieve better than 99.999% on-time delivery.

Load-tracking systems use queuing theory, linear programming and minimum spanning tree logic to predict and improve arrival times. The exact means of combining these are usually secret recipes deeply hidden in the software. The basic scheme is that hypothetical routes are constructed by combining road segments, and then poor ones are eliminated using linear programming.

The controlled routes allow a truck to avoid heavy traffic caused by rush-hour, accidents or road-work. Increasingly, governments are providing digital notification when roadways are known to have reduced capacity.

A good system lets the computer, dispatcher and driver collaborate on finding a good route, or a method to move the load. One special value is that the computer can automatically eliminate routes over roads that cannot take the weight of the truck, or that have overhead obstructions.

Usually, the drivers log into the system. The system helps remind a driver to rest. Rested drivers operate the truck more skillfully and safely.

When these systems were first introduced, some drivers resisted them, viewing them as a way for management to spy on the driver.

A well-managed intelligent transportation system provides drivers with huge amounts of help. It gives them a view of their own load and the network of roadways.

<text>McGeorge &quot;Mac&quot; Bundy (March 30, 1919 – September 16, 1996) was an American academic who served as the U.S. National Security Advisor to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 through 1966. He was president of the Ford Foundation from 1966 through 1979. Despite his career as a foreign-policy intellectual, educator, and philanthropist, he is best remembered as one of the chief architects of the United States&#x27; escalation of the Vietnam War during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

After World War II, during which Bundy served as an intelligence officer, in 1949 he was selected for the Council on Foreign Relations. He worked with a study team on implementation of the Marshall Plan. He was appointed a professor of government at Harvard University, and in 1953 as its youngest dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, working to develop Harvard as a merit-based university. In 1961 he joined Kennedy&#x27;s administration. After serving at the Ford Foundation, in 1979 he returned to academia as professor of history at New York University, and later as scholar in residence at the Carnegie Corporation.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1919 and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Bundy was the third son in a prosperous family long involved in Republican politics. His older brothers were Harvey Hollister Bundy, Jr., and William Putnam Bundy, and he had two younger sisters, Harriet Lowell and Katharine Lawrence. His father, Harvey Hollister Bundy, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, was a prominent attorney in Boston serving as a clerk for Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in his younger days. Bundy&#x27;s mother, Katherine Lawrence Putnam, was related to several Boston Brahmin families listed in the Social Register, the Lowells, the Cabots, and the Lawrences; she was a niece to Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell. Through his mother, Bundy grew up with the other Boston Brahmin families, and throughout his life he was well connected with American elites.

The Bundys were close to Henry L. Stimson. As Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover, in 1931 Stimson appointed Bundy&#x27;s father, as his Assistant Secretary of State. Later, Harvey served again under Stimson, when Stimson was Secretary of War in World War II, acting as Special Assistant on Atomic Matters, and serving as liaison between Stimson and the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Vannevar Bush. McGeorge grew up knowing Stimson as a family friend and colleague of their father. The senior Bundy also helped implement the Marshall Plan after the war.

McGeorge Bundy attended the private Dexter School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and the elite Groton School, where he placed first in his class and ran the student newspaper and debating society. Biographer David Halberstam writes:

He was admitted to Yale University, one year behind his brother William. When applying to Yale, Bundy wrote on the entrance exam &quot;This question is silly. If I were giving the test, this is the question I would ask, and this is my answer.&quot; Despite this, he was still admitted to Yale as he was awarded a perfect score on his entrance exam. At Yale, he served as secretary of the Yale Political Union and then chairman of its Liberal Party. He was on the staff of the &quot;Yale Literary Magazine&quot; and also wrote a column for the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, and as a senior was awarded the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize. Like his father, he was inducted into the Skull and Bones secret society, where he was nicknamed &quot;Odin.&quot; He remained in contact with his fellow Bonesmen for decades afterward. He graduated from Yale with an A.B. in mathematics in 1940. In 1940, he advocated American intervention in World War Two, writing &quot;Though war is evil, it is occasionally the lesser of two evils.&quot; In 1941, he was awarded a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Harvard Society of Fellows. At the time, Fellows were not allowed to pursue advanced degrees, &quot;a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill&quot;; thus, Bundy would never earn a doctorate.

In 1941, Bundy ran for the Ward 5 Seat on the Boston City Council. He was endorsed by the outgoing incumbent, Henry Lee Shattuck, but lost to A. Frank Foster by 92 votes.

=== Military service ===
During World War II, Bundy decided to join the United States Army despite his poor vision. He served as an intelligence officer. In 1943, he became an aide to Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, who knew his father. On 6 June 1944, as an aide to Admiral Kirk, Bundy witnessed first-hand the Operation Overlord landings from the deck of the cruiser USS &quot;Augusta&quot;. He was discharged at the rank of captain in 1946 and returned to Harvard, where he completed the remaining two years of his Junior Fellowship.

==Academic career==
From 1945 to 1947, Bundy worked with Henry Stimson as ghostwriter of his third-person autobiography, &quot;On Active Service in Peace and War&quot; (1947). Stimson suffered a massive heart attack (leading to a speech impediment) two months after completing his second appointment as United States Secretary of War in the fall of 1945, and Bundy&#x27;s assistance was integral to the completion of the book.

In 1948, he worked for Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey as a speechwriter specializing in foreign policy issues. Bundy had expected Dewey to win the 1948 election, and to be rewarded with some sort of senior post in a Dewey administration. After Dewey&#x27;s defeat, Bundy became a political analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where he studied Marshall Plan aid to Europe. Notable members of the study group were Dwight D. Eisenhower, then serving as president of Columbia University; future Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles; future CIA official Richard M. Bissell, Jr.; and diplomat George F. Kennan. The group&#x27;s deliberations were sensitive and secret, dealing as they did with the classified fact that there was a covert side to the Marshall Plan, by which the CIA used certain funds to aid anti-communist groups in France and Italy.

In 1949, Bundy was appointed as a visiting lecturer in Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Government. He taught the history of U.S. foreign policy and was popular among students; after two years, he was promoted to associate professor and recommended for tenure.

Following his promotion to full professor in 1953, Bundy was appointed dean of Harvard&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Only 34, he remains the youngest person to have received a decanal appointment in the university&#x27;s history as of 2019. An effective and popular administrator, Bundy led policy changes intended to develop Harvard as a class-blind, merit-based university with a reputation for stellar academics. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954. Bundy was listed as one of the &quot;young American scholars known as &#x27;New Conservatives&#x27;&quot; by Peter Viereck in 1956. During his time as a Dean at Harvard, Bundy first met Senator John F. Kennedy who sat on the Harvard Board of Overseers, and got to know him well. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991.

==National Security Advisor and Vietnam War==
Bundy moved into public political life in 1961 when appointed as National Security Advisor in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy considered Bundy for Secretary of State, but decided that since he was a relatively youthful president, that he wanted an older man as Secretary of State, causing him to appoint Bundy National Security Adviser instead. In common with other members of Kennedy&#x27;s cabinet, Bundy considered the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, to be ineffectual. Bundy, a registered Republican, offered to switch parties to become a registered Democrat when he entered the White House. Kennedy vetoed that offer, saying he preferred to have a Republican National Security Adviser to rebut charges that he was &quot;soft on Communism.&quot;
One of Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;wise men,&quot; Bundy played a crucial role in all of the major foreign policy and defense decisions of the Kennedy administration and was retained by Lyndon B. Johnson for part of his tenure. Bundy was involved in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. At the first meeting of the National Security Council under Kennedy, Bundy was told the four areas of worry were Cuba, the Congo, Laos, and Vietnam. From 1964 to 1966, he was also chair of the 303 Committee, responsible for coordinating government covert operations.

Bundy was a strong proponent of the Vietnam War during his tenure, believing it essential to contain communism. He supported escalating United States involvement, including commitment of hundreds of thousands of ground troops and the sustained bombing of North Vietnam in 1965. According to Kai Bird, Bundy and other advisors well understood the risk but proceeded with these actions largely because of domestic politics, rather than believing that the US had a realistic chance of victory in this war.

In November 1961, Bundy advised Kennedy to send a division to fight in Vietnam, writing: &quot;Laos was never really ours after 1954. South Vietnam is and want to be.&quot; In 1963, Bundy vetoed an attempt by another Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, to join the Kennedy administration. Bundy knew Kissinger well and told Kennedy that he was a schemer who was not to be trusted. In August 1963, when the diplomat Paul Kattenburg advised ending American support for South Vietnam, Bundy was extremely critical, arguing that American aid to South Vietnam was working as planned and accused Kattenburg of making an argument with no evidence. In October 1963, he agreed to the transfer of the CIA station chief, John Richardson, to help clear the way for a coup against President Diem. Just before the coup on 29 October 1963, Bundy wired the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge: &quot;We do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power to delay or discourage a coup.&quot; On the night of 1 November, Bundy stayed up all night, awaiting news of the coup, and reported to Kennedy in the morning that only the presidential guard had stayed loyal while the rest of the South Vietnamese Army had supported the coup. On 4 November, Bundy told the media that the United States would recognize the new government in Saigon. The same day he told to Kennedy that photographs of corpses of the Ngo brothers (Diệm and Nhu) might appear in the media showing their hands tied behind their backs and bullet holes through the back of their heads, joking that this was not his preferred way to commit suicide (it was initially announced that both Ngo brothers had committed suicide, though it was later admitted that they had been executed).

On 22 November 1963, Bundy was at his office in Washington when he received a telephone call from the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara telling him that Kennedy had just been assassinated while visiting Dallas, Texas. Bundy broke down in tears at the news of the death of his friend. Bundy took a somewhat patronizing attitude to the new president, Lyndon Johnson, telling him before his first cabinet meeting as president to &quot;avoid any suggestion of over-assertiveness.&quot; In the spring of 1964, Bundy told Johnson that the South Vietnamese government was unable to defeat the Viet Cong and American intervention would probably be necessary. As Bundy sought to ingratiate himself with Johnson, his once friendly relations with Robert Kennedy declined as the latter considered him a &quot;turncoat.&quot; Johnson was annoyed by Bundy&#x27;s habit, which started when Kennedy was president, of popping in and out of the Oval Office as it suited him, and asked him to stick to a strict schedule.

In January 1964, Bundy advised Johnson to dismiss General Paul D. Harkins as commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, writing: &quot;I do not know anyone, except perhaps Max Taylor, in the top circle of the government who believes that General Harkins is the right man for the war in Vietnam now … Harkins has been unimpressive in his reporting and analyzing, and has shown a lack of grip on the realities of the situation.&quot; Bundy advised replacing Harkins with General William Westmoreland, saying Vietnam is &quot;much too important to be decided by Bob McNamara&#x27;s reluctance to offend Max Taylor, saying that Johnson had the power &quot;to give him a direct order to do what in his heart he knows he should. He is a soldier.&quot; Johnson distrusted Bundy because of his family&#x27;s inherited wealth and his elite status as a product of Ivy League universities, and much preferred McNamara who only became rich as an executive with the Ford Motor Company and had only attended Harvard Business School. For his part, Bundy found many of Johnson&#x27;s mannerisms highly offensive such as his practice of exposing his penis to prove that he was well endowed and refusing to close the bathroom door when he was using the toilet. Johnson rather enjoyed offending Bundy.

In October 1964, when the Undersecretary of State, George Ball, circulated a memo &quot;How Valid Are the Assumptions Underlying Our Vietnam Policy?&quot;, Bundy emerged as Ball&#x27;s leading critic and offered Johnson a detailed memo arguing there was no comparison between the French and American wars in Vietnam. In December 1964 after the Vietcong bombed the Brink&#x27;s Hotel in Saigon, Bundy advised Johnson to begin a strategical bombing campaign against North Vietnam, giving in a memo five reasons not to bomb North Vietnam vs. nine reasons to bomb North Vietnam. Bundy predicated that bombing North Vietnam would solve South Vietnam&#x27;s morale problems, saying the South Vietnamese soldiers would fight better once they knew the United States was involved in the war. In a cable to Maxwell Taylor, the ambassador in Saigon, Johnson gave domestic reasons why he would not bomb North Vietnam at present, saying he was to introduce his Great Society reforms soon, complaining about conservative Republicans and Democrats that: &quot;They hate this stuff, they don&#x27;t want to help the poor and the Negroes, but they&#x27;re afraid to be against it at a time like this when there&#x27;s all this prosperity. But the war-oh, they&#x27;ll like the war.&quot; However, Johnson went on that once his Great Society reforms were adopted by Congress, he would commit the United States to war, saying he had doubts that North Vietnam could be defeated by strategic bombing alone, and he would send American troops to fight in South Vietnam sometime in 1965.

In February 1965, Bundy visited South Vietnam. On 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attacked an American air base at Pleiku with mortars, killing eight Americans and wounding 126. Bundy advised Johnson to begin a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam in retaliation. Bundy afterwards visited the Pleiku base where he was disturbed by the sight of the wounded servicemen, saying he never seen so much blood in all his life. Upon his return to Washington, Bundy in a memo to the president wrote: &quot;The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating, and without new U.S. action defeat appears inevitable-probably not in a matter of weeks or perhaps even months, but within the next year or so. There is still time to turn around, but not much. The stakes in Vietnam are extremely high, the American investment is very large, and the American responsibility is a fact of life which is palpable in the atmosphere of Asia, and even elsewhere. The international prestige of the United States, and a substantial part of our influence, are directly at risk in Vietnam.&quot; Bundy called for &quot;graduated and continuing bombings&quot; of North Vietnam as the best response. Bundy reported that what he had seen in South Vietnam suggested that the majority of the South Vietnamese people believed &quot;the Vietcong are going to win in the long run.&quot; When the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who was alarmed by Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policy proposed a summit in an attempt to change his policy, Bundy told the British ambassador Lord Harlech that such a summit would be &quot;unhelpful&quot;. The columnist Walter Lippmann contacted Bundy asking him to advise Johnson to change his Vietnam policies, only to find that the National Security Adviser was solidly loyal to the president. Lippmann was astonished by Bundy&#x27;s ignorance about Vietnamese history as he discovered Bundy had no idea that South Vietnam was a recent creation.

Bundy advised Johnson that the best way to &quot;sell&quot; the Vietnam War to the American people was as an extension of the Great Society. Bundy told the president he should create a multi-billion dollar Southeast Asia Development Corporation that would build an enormous dam on the Mekong River which he wrote would be &quot;bigger and more imaginative than the TVA and a lot tougher to do&quot;. Bundy suggested the proposed Southeast Asia Development Corporation and its dam on the Mekong would be able to bring electricity to all of Southeast Asia and thereby industrialize the entire region within the next 20 or so years. In a speech on 7 April 1965 at Johns Hopkins University, Johnson proposed the Southeast Asia Development Corporation and the dam on the Mekong that would electrify all of Southeast Asia, saying that the Vietnam war was a struggle for economic development, which he accused North Vietnam of seeking to prevent. As the war continued, Johnson berated Bundy, saying he wanted &quot;more ideas and more horsepower and more imagination&quot;.

In March 1965, the first &quot;teach-in&quot; to protest the Vietnam war was held at the University of Michigan and Bundy was challenged to a debate, which he declined, saying in a public letter &quot;if your letter came to me for grading as a professor, I would not be able to give it high marks&quot;. Subsequently, Bundy accepted a challenge from George McTurnan Kahin, a Cornell University professor who specialized in Southeast Asia, for a public debate to be televised live on 15 May 1965. Johnson did not want the debate to take place, fearing that Bundy might lose. Johnson arranged to send Bundy to the Dominican Republic, causing him to miss the debate. One of the debate&#x27;s organizers, Barry Commoner, a biologist at the University of Washington, stated that Bundy might give other professors bad marks for their letters, but he &quot;has turned in a terrible record on attendance&quot;. When the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; newspaper ran an editorial criticizing the Vietnam War, Bundy who always closely followed developments at Harvard, wrote an 11-page rebuttal criticizing the editorial and compared the editors of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; to the appeasers of the 1930s.

When Bundy realized that Johnson had sent him to Santo Domingo to prevent him from debating Kahin, without informing the president he contacted Fred Friendly, a television producer at CBS, saying he wanted to debate Hans Morgenthau, an international affairs professor at the University of Chicago, live on television. When Johnson learned that CBS was airing the Bundy-Morgenthau debate on 21 June 1965, Johnson was incensed, saying to his aide Bill Moyers: &quot;Do you see this? Bundy is going on television-on national television-with five professors. That&#x27;s an act of disloyalty. He didn&#x27;t tell me because he knew I didn&#x27;t want him to do it&quot;. Johnson told Moyers to go sack Bundy on the spot, but changed his mind. Relations between Johnson and Bundy were notably tense afterwards. On 21 June 1965, the television debate was aired live under the title &quot;Vietnam Dialogue: Mr. Bundy and the Professors&quot; with Eric Sevareid as the moderator. During the debate, Bundy accused Morgenthau of being a defeatist and pessimist, citing his 1961 statement that Laos was destined to go Communist, leading Morgenthau to reply: &quot;I may have been dead wrong on Laos, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I am dead wrong on Vietnam&quot;. Bundy then brought up a statement Morgenthau made in 1956, praising President Diem of South Vietnam for creating a &quot;miracle&quot;. Bundy was generally considered to have won the debate, but Johnson was still furious with him. Bundy privately conceded that his time as National Security Adviser was coming to a close. Johnson instructed Moyers to terminate Bundy, who upon being told he was fired, stated &quot;Again?&quot; and went back to work. Though Johnson kept changing his mind about whatever to sack Bundy, he could see his time at the White House was quite limited, and he contacted Nathan Pusey, the president of Harvard asking if he could return to academia.

In June 1965, Bundy advised Johnson not to step up the bombing in response to the execution by the Viet Cong of an American POW, Sergeant Harold Bennett, warning that this mean in a certain sense losing control of the level of the bombing: such a precedent would mean the United States would have to step up the bombing in the event of future atrocities. However, Bundy told Ball at the time that his influence over Johnson was in decline and he did not expect his advice to be accepted. Johnson ordered the bombing to increased as Bundy feared that he would. In July 1965, Bundy recruited a group of elder statesmen known as &quot;the Wise Men&quot; to advise Johnson from time to time. The unofficial leader of the &quot;Wise Men&quot; was the former Secretary of State Dean Acheson. The first meeting of the &quot;Wise Men&quot; did not go well: Johnson engaged in an extended bout of self-pity, complaining that he had only acted in Vietnam because he had to and was being criticized by the media and Congress; this bout was much to the disgust of the &quot;Wise Men&quot;, who complained that they had not come to the White House to listen to this. However, the &quot;Wise Men&quot; expressed their approval of Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policy, and Bundy afterwards thanked Acheson, saying that Johnson felt more confident now that he was acting correctly.

Despite his support for the war, Bundy criticized what he regarded as a sloppy thinking by other members of Johnson&#x27;s cabinet, most notably in July 1965 when he attacked the plans of McNamara to send more troops to Vietnam as being &quot;rash to the point of folly...In particular I see no reason to suppose that the Vietcong will accommodate us by fighting the kind of war we desire. I think the odds are that if we put in 40-50 battalions with the missions here proposed, we shall find them only lightly engaged and ineffective in hot pursuit.&quot; Bundy stated the problem with Vietnam was that the South Vietnamese state was dysfunctional, leading him to write &quot;...this is a slippery slope toward total U.S. responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side&quot;. Bundy advised Johnson not to send more troops to South Vietnam as a way to pressure the South Vietnamese to make reforms. Bundy advised Johnson to ponder: &quot;What are the chances of our getting into a white man&#x27;s war with all the brown men against us or apathetic?&quot;. However, Bundy was still committed to the war as he wrote in another memo titled &quot;France in Vietnam, 1954, and the U.S. in Vietnam, 1965-A Useful Analogy?&quot; that France failed because of &quot;the war&#x27;s acute unpopularity&quot; and &quot;French political instability&quot;, none of which Bundy wrote applied to the United States in 1965. Expanding on this theme, Bundy wrote: &quot;France was never united or consistent in her prosecution of the war in Indochina. The war was not popular in France itself, was actively opposed on the left and was cynically used by others for domestic political ends&quot;. By contrast, Bundy wrote at present that only academics and churchmen were opposed to the war, and they were a minority within a minority, reminding Johnson that according to the most recent polls 62% of American supported the war.

In July 1965, an American diplomat in Paris, Ed Gullion, opened up secret talks with Mai Van Bo, who headed the National Liberation Front&#x27;s office in Paris. To provide secrecy, Gullion was code-named R. Bundy advised Johnson to let the talks proceed, writing: &quot;Let R do the talking this time and see if there is any give in his position&quot;. However, the XYZ talks as the negotiations were called floundered over the demand that the United States unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam as a precondition for peace talks.

As Pusey was unable to give him a position consistent with his former station, Bundy contacted John McCloy, the chairman of the Ford Foundation, to see if he could become president of the Ford Foundation. Bundy had difficult relations with Johnson by this point, but he felt it was his patriotic duty as an American to leave government service in a manner that did not embarrass the president. On 8 November 1965, Bundy was offered the presidency of the Ford Foundation, whose annual pay was $75,000 compared to the $30,000 he made as National Security Adviser. Furthermore, the Ford Foundation had an endowment of $200 million to be spent annually, making it the world&#x27;s biggest charity, which appealed to Bundy, as it allow him to maintain that he was still engaged in important work. Through Bundy had discussed his interest in the Ford Foundation with Johnson previously, when the president learned from reading the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the offer had been made, he was notably angry. Bundy agreed to stay on until the end of 1966, but Johnson became abrasive and abusive towards him, taking the viewpoint that Bundy was guilty of betraying him and he was a coward who was leaving because he could not handle the stress of the Vietnam War. As Johnson ceased listening to Bundy, his role by the end of 1966 had been reduced to reporting information and laying out options for the president. In his last report to Johnson in 1966, he stated China was denouncing the Americans as &quot;running dogs of imperialism&quot;; that Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia believed a peaceful end to the war was possible with time; that the governments of Hungary and Algeria were offering to serve as intermediaries in peace talks; that the French president Charles de Gaulle wanted the United States to cease bombing North Vietnam and open talks; and that the governments of Britain and Canada were pressing the Soviet Union in turn to pressure North Vietnam to open peace talks. In his last service to Johnson, when Senator Robert F. Kennedy criticized the Vietnam War in a speech on 31 October 1966, Bundy went on &quot;On Meet the Press&quot; television show to offer a defense of the Johnson administration and to rebut Kennedy&#x27;s criticism.

==Return to academia==
He left government in 1966 to serve as president of the Ford Foundation, remaining in this position until 1979. On 12 October 1968, Bundy criticized the Vietnam War in a speech, saying: &quot;There is no prospect of military victory against North Vietnam by any level of U.S. military force which is acceptable or desirable.&quot;

After testifying before the Church Committee in 1975, Bundy issued a statement: &quot;As far as I ever knew, or know now, no one in the White House or at the Cabinet level ever gave any approval of any kind to any CIA effort to assassinate anyone.&quot; Bundy added: &quot;I told the committee in particular that it is wholly inconsistent with what I know of President Kennedy and his brother Robert that either of them would have given any such order or authorization or consent to anyone through any channel.&quot;

Beginning in 1979, Bundy returned to academia as a professor of history at New York University. He was professor emeritus from 1989 until his death. During this period, he helped found the group known as the &quot;Gang of Four,&quot; whose other members were George F. Kennan, Robert McNamara and Gerard Smith; together they spoke and wrote about American nuclear policies. They published an influential 1983 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article that proposed ending the US policy of &quot;first use of nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet invasion of Europe&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First Fifty Years&quot; (1988). Their work has been credited with contributing to the SALT II treaty a decade later.

Bundy was employed by the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1990 until his death, serving as chair of the Committee on Reducing the Nuclear Danger (1990–1993) and scholar-in-residence (1993–1996).

==Personal life and death==
In 1950, he married Mary Buckminster Lothrop, who came from a socially prominent and wealthy Bostonian family; they had four sons.

Bundy died on 16 September 1996 from a heart attack at age 77. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
*In 1969 he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson, one of 20 to receive the medal &quot;in the last 24 hours of [Johnson&#x27;s] presidency in January 1969&quot;.
*Bundy was later included on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Enemies List&quot;, his compilation of political opponents.
*Views of Bundy&#x27;s role in the Vietnam War changed over the decades. Gordon Goldstein&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;Lessons in Disaster: McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam&quot;, was reported in late September 2009 as the &quot;must-read-book&quot; among President Barack Obama&#x27;s war advisers, as they contemplated the alternative courses ahead in Afghanistan. Richard C. Holbrooke, who had reviewed the book in late November 2008, was a member of the team of presidential advisers in 2009.

<text>Summit County is an urban county located in the northeast region of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 540,428, making it the fourth-most populous county in Ohio. Its county seat and largest city is Akron. The county was formed on March 3, 1840, from portions of Medina, Portage and Stark counties. It was named Summit County because the highest elevation on the Ohio and Erie Canal is in the county. Summit County is part of the Akron, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.7%) is water.

<doc id="93028" wikidata="Q421974" url="?curid=93028" title="Stark County, Ohio">
<text>Stark County is a county located in the northeastern part of U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 374,853. Its county seat is Canton. The county was created in 1808 and organized the next year. It is named for John Stark, an officer in the American Revolutionary War.

Stark County is included in the Canton-Massillon, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Stark County was named in honor of American Revolutionary War General John Stark. John Stark (August 28, 1728 – May 8, 1822) was a general who served in the American Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He became widely known as the &quot;Hero of Bennington&quot; for his exemplary service at the Battle of Bennington in 1777.

In the 1760s and 1770s Moravian missionaries from Pennsylvania came to preach the gospel to the native people, and also to lead and resettle already converted native people migrating away from whites encroaching on their land in Pennsylvania. The earliest of these were Christian Frederick Post and John Heckewelder. See also the history of neighboring Tuscarawas County, Ohio

The first permanent settlements were established in 1805, beginning with Canton. Possibly 80% of the early settlers were German-speakers from Pennsylvania, although others came from Virginia, New York, and New England. Lumbering and sawmills were important early industries, to cater to the enormous demand for lumber from the incoming settlers. Stark County was originally part of Columbiana County, but was split off in 1807.

At the start of the Civil War the men of Stark County were quick to volunteer to preserve the Union. As of 1862 over 1,100 had enlisted.

During the early 20th century, Stark County was an important location in the early development of professional football. The rivalry between the Massillon Tigers and Canton Bulldogs helped bring the Ohio League to prominence in the mid-1900s (decade) and again in the late 1910s. The Bulldogs ended up a charter member of the National Football League, where it played for several years. (The role Stark County had in developing the game is part of the reason the Pro Football Hall of Fame is located in Canton.) Two relatively large football stadiums, Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton and Paul Brown Tiger Stadium in Massillon, are still in use (albeit now mostly for high school football), with Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosting the NFL&#x27;s annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game each year.

In the later 20th century, Stark County&#x27;s voting record swung from one party to another, closely tracking the winner of the U.S. Presidential election. Even within the swing state of Ohio, Stark County is regarded as a quintessential bellwether, and thus presidential candidates have typically made multiple visits to the region. Major media outlets typically pay close attention to the election results in the county. The &quot;New York Times&quot; in particular has covered the county&#x27;s citizens and their voting concerns in a series of features each election cycle for over a decade.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water.

==Politics==

Stark County has often been described as &quot;the swing county, in the swing state&quot; when it comes to presidential elections. Locally, it has generally been a strong Republican area, but that changed in the 1990s and into the 2000s, where it remained highly competitive for both parties. In 1992, it became a swing county that tilted Democratic, and over the next 15–20 years more local office holders were Democrats. That has changed, however, in the last 10 years or so, beginning in 2010. Republicans now hold most of the local elected positions. Starting in 2016, the county began shifting more and more Republican, with Trump comfortably winning the county in all three of his presidential bids, each by a bigger margin than the last.

<text>Seneca County is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 55,069. Its county seat is Tiffin. The county was created in 1820 and organized in 1824. It is named for the Seneca Indians, the westernmost nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. This people were based in present-day New York but had territory extending into Pennsylvania and Ohio. Seneca County comprises the Tiffin, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Findlay–Tiffin, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
This area was long occupied by a succession of indigenous peoples. During and after the colonial period, French, British and American fur traders established relations with the historic peoples of the time.

The county was barely inhabited by European Americans until the 1830s, but this period was one of steady migration by settlers from New York and New England. The migration was stimulated by completion of the Erie Canal through New York, which connected the markets by the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and New York City. By 1860 the population of Seneca County had increased to about half the current number of residents. It was developed for agriculture, and grew slowly thereafter.

Toward the end of the 19th century, during the Great Depression, and the post–World War II baby boom, this area had periods of greater population increase. In 1980 the census recorded a population of 61,901; the total has since declined. Since about 2000, the county&#x27;s population declines by about 100–300 persons annually, mainly due to a migration deficit of about 300 persons annually. This decline is projected to continue in the future.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

Almost 80% of the county&#x27;s total area is agricultural land. Some 10% is covered by forest. Most of the rest is developed, with some allocated for pastureland.

The terrain of Seneca County is nearly level, gently sloping from about 290 meters ASL in the southeast to about 210 m ASL at the edge of the Great Black Swamp in the northwest. Most of the county&#x27;s area is located between 230 and 260 m ASL, however. Almost the entire county belongs to the Sandusky River drainage basin; the river bisects the county from north to south slightly west of its middle. Tiffin developed on both sides of the river, which flows north to its mouth at Lake Erie. There is some steeper terrain along the river&#x27;s course, formed by the occasional ravine of its tributaries.

The Great Lakes moderate temperatures somewhat, but Seneca County has essentially a continental climate. After most of the forests were cleared for agricultural development, the microclimate was disrupted. Winters can be harsh, with plentiful snowfall due to lake-effect snow. Summers are often hot and oppressively humid, bordering on subtropical. The mostly featureless surface does not form any obstacles to the winter winds sweeping south from Canada, resulting in extreme wind chill at times. In a 1906 description, the local climate was described as &quot;rather unhealthful&quot;.

Johnson in 1964 and Bill Clinton in 1996 were the exceptions.

==Natural history==
Before widespread settlement, the area of Seneca County was for the most part woodland. Besides the fringe of the Great Black Swamp in the northwest, there was also an extensive area of marshland in the Bloomville area as well as smaller patches of swamp terrain which were formed due to the county&#x27;s essentially level terrain. Native American inhabitants and later settlers used the region mainly for hunting fur animals, with little agriculture of note until the early 19th century.

Starting in the early-mid 19th century, the county&#x27;s area was subject to wholesale deforestation. This led to massive alteration of much of the local wildlife, with grassland and farmland animals replacing the native woodland fauna. Migrant waterbirds, in ancient times commonly encountered throughout the region as they foraged in the swamps on their way south, are nowadays rare and concentrate on the few remaining waterbodies large enough to sustain them. The passenger pigeon (&quot;Ectopistes migratorius&quot;) had several roosting (and probably nesting) places in the county when it was still wooded. Removal of the forest had driven the birds away by the 1860s, foreshadowing its eventual total extinction due to large-scale logging which rendered this species unable to sustain the massive hunting pressure.

Several species of waterbirds, formerly frequently encountered during migration, are only rarely seen nowadays. These include, for example, the common loon (&quot;Gavia immer&quot;), American wigeon (&quot;Anas americana&quot;), redhead (&quot;Aythya americana&quot;), canvasback (&quot;Aythya valisneria&quot;), and several species of mergansers.

Landbirds were apparently less seriously affected; apart from the passenger pigeon, the ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and marsh wren (&quot;Cistothorus palustris&quot;) had essentially or completely disappeared by 1900. However, it is not known how many of the numerous species of New World warblers, most of which today only occur only as transient migrants, formerly bred in Seneca County.

The Eskimo curlew (&quot;Numenius borealis&quot;), possibly extinct today, occurred as a transient in Ohio until about 1900; to what extent it migrated through Seneca County is not well known but even if it did it is unlikely that it was often seen after deforestation had gotten underway in earnest. The extinct Carolina parakeet (&quot;Conuropsis carolinensis&quot;) – or probably individuals of the western subspecies, the Louisiana Parakeet (&quot;C. c. ludovicianus&quot;) – may have on occasion have occurred in Seneca County as a vagrant before 1862.

The only record of the long-billed murrelet (&quot;Brachyramphus perdix&quot;) in Ohio comes from Seneca County. A stray individual of this North Pacific auk was observed and photographed between November 12–18, 1996. The rare Kirtland&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Setophaga kirtlandii&quot;) is again increasing in numbers and may occasionally range as far north as Seneca County.

The introduced house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) is common since at least the late 19th century. The ring-necked pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), another species introduced from Europe, never seems to have become really plentiful, though it has been a breeding resident since at least 1901.

==Government==

Portsmouth is Scioto County&#x27;s county seat. The county courthouse is at the corner of Sixth and Court streets. It was designed by John Scudder Adkins and constructed in 1936 as a public works project. The county jail, once in the courthouse, is now in a new facility at the site of the former Norfolk and Western rail depot, near U.S. 23. It was constructed in 2006.

Scioto County is the site of the state&#x27;s Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, in Lucasville. It is Ohio&#x27;s only maximum security prison and the site of Ohio&#x27;s death house, where death row inmates are executed.

The county maintenance garage is also in Lucasville.

==Economy==

Scioto County&#x27;s economy has been strongly based on that of Portsmouth after heavy industry replaced agriculture and river trade as most important. Through the early 20th century and until the 1970s, heavy industry such as steel mills and shoe factories drove the county&#x27;s economy. Since these factories closed, Scioto County has lost jobs and revenue.

In the early 21st century, the service industry and healthcare, such as the Southern Ohio Medical Center (SOMC), is the county&#x27;s largest employer. Scioto County is home to Ohio&#x27;s newest state university, Shawnee State University, which enrolls between 3,300 and 4,000 students and grants associate, baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees. Much of the recent economic growth and change in the county is related to SOMC and Shawnee State University. Recently Infra-Metals announced the development of a new steel shipping/fabrication site in New Boston, Ohio in the Bob Walton Industrial Park. The plant is under construction and will have access to both barge and rail loading facilities.

In November 2002, the Portsmouth Uranium Enrichment Plant in nearby Piketon was recognized as an ANS Nuclear Historic Landmark by the American Nuclear Society. It had served a military function from 1952 until the mid-1960s, when the mission changed from enriching uranium for nuclear weapons to producing fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. The Portsmouth Uranium Enrichment Plant ended enriching operations in 2001. It began to support operational and administrative functions and perform external contract work. All uranium enrichment in the area has been taken over by a sister plant in Paducah, Kentucky. Uranium enrichment functions had been shared by the two plants. USEC interests in the area remain strong, and the American Centrifuge Plant was constructed in the first decade of the 21st century in Piketon. This commercial uranium enrichment facility was expected to employ up to 500 people and reach an initial annual production level of 3.5 million SWU by 2010.

Scioto County has also been the benefactor of Suncoke (coke (fuel) production). Sole Choice, Inc., the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of shoelaces, is in the county. Graf Brothers Flooring and Lumber, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of rift and quartered oak products, has two satellite log yards in the county. Its main office is across the river in South Shore, Kentucky.

The Vern Riffe Arts Center, on the Shawnee State University campus, hosts many local and traveling performances, including Broadway plays and Miss Ohio pageants. Scioto County is home to the Boneyfiddle Historical District (which is on the National Register of Historic Places), SSU&#x27;s Clark Planetarium, the 1810 House, Greenup Locks &amp; Dam, the Philip Moore Stone House, Roy Rogers&#x27; Memorabilia Exhibit, the Southern Ohio Museum, and Spartan Municipal Stadium.

==Events==
Scioto County is best known for Portsmouth&#x27;s &quot;River Days&quot; activities, which include a parade, a pageant associated with local high schools, boat races on the Ohio River (in the past), musical performances and a carnival. River Days occurs on Labor Day (the first Monday of September) weekend. Activities begin on Thursday evening and the parade and pageant is on Saturday.

The Scioto County Fair is held in the first full week of August of each year. It is one of the largest in the state, drawing approximately 75,000 visitors each year (the single-day record is 17,000). The first county fair was held in 1828; in 1908 Lucasville became the official site when three fairs (Mount Joy, Portsmouth and Lucasville) merged into one. The Roy Rogers&#x27; Homecoming Festival is held each June.

<text>Portage County is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 161,791. Located in Northeast Ohio, Portage County is part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area. Its county seat is Ravenna and its largest city is Kent. The county, named for the portage between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas rivers, was created in 1807 and formally organized in 1808. In addition to the cities of Kent and Ravenna, Portage County also includes the cities of Aurora and Streetsboro, along with five villages, 18 civil townships, and several unincorporated places within those townships. Additionally, the county includes parts of the city of Tallmadge, and part of the village of Mogadore, both of which are mostly in neighboring Summit County.

==History==
The name &quot;Portage&quot; comes from an old Indian path called &quot;Portage Path&quot;, which ran between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas rivers, where travelers portaged their canoes. The location of the trail today is within the boundaries of neighboring Summit County.

As of 1600, the area was likely almost entirely home to the Whittlesey culture, a presumably Algonquian people who lived along the southern shore of Lake Erie, to the west of the Erie Nation. They were a mixed culture people and also exhibited signs of picking up traits from both Fort Ancients and Iroquoians. The Erie may have also held a bit of the area, but this is unclear. During the Beaver Wars, approximately 1632–1701, the Whittlesey and Erie were already at war when the Erie decided to also declare war on the Iroquois for the atrocities being committed against allied tribes in Canada. The Erie lost around 1650 and the Whittlesey were likely similarly subjugated afterwards, as the Iroquois conquered all the way to the shores of Lake Michigan by the 1670s.

The Iroquois placed a vassal tribe of captured Huron in the area who became known as the Wyandot, while they conquered further west. Later, the French made it to the Mississippi River and volunteered to aid the Natives in that region to push the Iroquois back to New York. By the end of the Beaver Wars, the Wyandot had broken free of Iroquois control and reabsorbed surviving Hurons taking refuge all over the Great Lakes, but set aside the area roughly between the Cuyahoga River, the Mahoning River and the Ohio-Pennsylvania border as a collective hunting ground, to be enjoyed by all the tribes of the region. The Lenape had a village around modern day Youngstown, possibly established during the 1690s, from which they and the Seneca and Shawnee from further south staged ventures into the region and up in Ashtabula County, the Ottawas, or Mississaugas, from the western end of Lake Erie were allowed to maintain a village at Conneaut. Ashtabula itself seems to come from the Algonquian name for the area and roughly translates to &quot;Place with Enough for everyone.&quot; The Lenape later lost rights to the eastern extremes of their territory between the Potomac River and the Mahoning River by a government proclamation in 1763, but sources say they began relocating into Tuscarawas and Holmes Counties in 1758 in preparation for such an event.

The region continued being used as such until around 1785, when the newly formed United States tried issuing a treaty stripping the vast majority of what is now Ohio from Native control and began offering subsidies for people to move into the region, sparking the Northwest Indian War from 1785-1795. In the aftermath, the government issued the Treaty of Greenville, which stripped even more land from the Natives than originally planned and opened up northeast Ohio for white settlement for the first time. Most Natives did not leave and mixed tribal communities still existed all over the state for some time afterwards, with permanent Ottawa, Seneca, and Wyandot villages still existing in what is now Portage and Geauga Counties, but all written accounts of Natives seems to have ceased sometime around the War of 1812, which is also when the Shawnee War (1811-1813) was occurring. The local government had its own land arrangements with the Natives for a time. It is unclear where the Natives went, after that, but this may coincide with the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes, one of the most massive earthquakes to ever hit the east coast in recorded history, and was interpreted by many Ohio Natives that they should throw their support behind Shawnee cult leader, Tenskwatawa, at the Prophettown stronghold, which also coincides with the outbreak of the Shawnee War, later that year. Most of the Eastern nations got sucked up into his cult and many Natives relocated to live near him.

Portage County is also home to a burial mound—Towner&#x27;s Mound, in Franklin Township—which outdates all the above mentioned cultures. It was unique in structure to other types of burial mounds from the Adena, Hopewell, and Fort Ancient cultures, but identical to two other excavated mounds in North Benton, Ohio, and Warren, Pennsylvania.

After the discovery of the New World, the land that became Portage County was originally part of the French colony of Canada (New France), which was ceded in 1763 to Great Britain and renamed the Province of Quebec. In the late 18th century the land became part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory, then was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795.

The first European settler in what is now Portage County was Abraham Honey in 1798 in the area now known as Mantua Township, followed by Asa Hall in what is now Atwater Township in April 1799. In June 1799, Benjamin Tappan, Jr. arrived and founded Ravenna, David Daniels came to what is now Palmyra Township, and Ebenezer Sheldon settled in what is now Aurora. A family group of Huguenot refugees also eventually migrated to Portage County by 1804.
When first settled, the area that presently constitutes Portage County was part of the original Jefferson County, which had been organized in 1797. In 1800, the area was made part of Trumbull County, which followed the boundaries of the Connecticut Western Reserve. In 1802, all of what is now Portage County was organized under the name of Franklin Township with other townships being formed later. On February 10, 1807, the Ohio state legislature passed the act to create Portage County from Trumbull County and it took effect June 7, 1807. Portage County remained attached to Trumbull County until June 8, 1808, when the first elections were held. Initially, the county included a large area of the Western Reserve that encompassed most of present-day Summit County, all of Medina and Huron counties, and parts of Lorain and Ashland counties. There were six organized townships in 1808: Franklin, Deerfield, Aurora, Hiram, Springfield, and Hudson with new townships organized later, reaching a maximum of 30. The present-day boundaries of Portage County were established in 1840 following the 1812 creation of Medina County, a slight boundary adjustment in 1827 with Cuyahoga County, and finally the creation of Summit County in 1840, which took 10 townships from Portage County along with 3 townships from Medina County and two from Stark County.

What is referred to as the last great train robbery in US history occurred in Garrettsville in 1935. The government sent in a massive team to investigate, whom the locals called the G-Men. Today, the James A. Garfield schools in Garrettsville have the G-Men as their team mascot.

Portage County was also the site of the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970.

==Communities==
Portage County is arranged as a 4 x 5 grid of 20 rectangles and contains all or part of 18 unincorporated townships, five cities, and six villages. Under Ohio law, there are two types of incorporated municipal jurisdictions: cities and villages; and any territory within a county that is not part of an incorporated municipality is part of a township. Townships have limited local government and services.

In addition to the cities, village, and townships, the United States Census Bureau has four census-designated places (CDP) in Portage County. These CDPs are for statistical purposes only and have no government or official boundaries separate from the township they are located in. There are also 17 additional named places in the county. All 17 places are considered part of whatever jurisdiction they are located in (township or municipality) and have no formal boundaries or additional government of their own.

Camp James A. Garfield, formerly known as the Ravenna Training and Logistics Site and commonly known as the Ravenna Arsenal, occupies much of the land in Charlestown, Paris, and Windham townships, as well as a small part of Freedom Township. While the portions of Camp Garfield are still considered part of the various townships they cover, the land is under the jurisdiction of the US federal government.

<text>Pickaway County is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,539. Its county seat is Circleville. Its name derives from the Pekowi band of Shawnee Indians, who inhabited the area. (See List of Ohio county name etymologies.)

Pickaway County is part of the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The future state of Ohio was part of the Northwest Territory, created in 1787. To begin providing local control of this area, several counties were designated, among them Washington (1788) and Wayne (1796) Counties. Portions of these counties were partitioned off to create Ross (1798), Fairfield (1800), and Franklin (1803) Counties. An act of the General Assembly of Ohio (January 12, 1810) directed that portions of Fairfield, Franklin, and Ross counties were to be partitioned off to create Pickaway County effective March 1, 1810, with Circleville named as county seat later that year (see History of Circleville).

==Geography==
The Scioto River flows southward through the center of Pickaway County. Big Darby Creek drains the upper western part of the county, discharging into the Scioto at Circleville, and Deer Creek drains the lower western part of the county, flowing southward into Ross County. The county terrain consists of low rolling hills carved with drainages; all available areas (87%) are devoted to agriculture. The terrain&#x27;s highest point (1,090&#x27; or 332 m ASL) lies on the county&#x27;s east border, east-northeast of Hargus Lake. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.

<text>Paulding County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was about 18,806. Its county seat is Paulding. The county was created in 1820 and later organized in 1839. It is named for John Paulding, one of the captors of Major John André in the American Revolutionary War.

==History==
The Ottawa tribe of Native Americans were the prevalent occupants of the region before Europeans arrived in North America following the 1492 expedition of Christopher Columbus. By 1750, however, there were Miamis, Prankaahaws, Delawares, Shawnee, Kickapoos, Muscounteres, Huron, Weas, Wyandotts and Mohawks.

Under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Continental Congress opened what is now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin to settlement. However, the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution in 1783 allowed the British to remain in the Northwest Territory until matters were resolved with the Indians. General Washington sent General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne to subdue the native population. He built a series of forts, including Fort Brown, located between Charloe and Melrose. In order to defend against Indian ambush, he cut a swath of woods a mile wide, known as the Wayne Trace. His campaign culminated in a decisive 1794 victory by the Legion of the United States against Indians led by Chief Little Turtle of the nearby Maumee, Ohio in the Battle of Fallen Timbers, and signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.

Paulding County was originally part of territory set aside for Ohio&#x27;s Indian people by the Treaty of Greenville, though that did not last long. Paulding County was organized by the legislature on April 1, 1820, from lands that were formerly part of Williams County. At that point, it consisted of 12 perfectly square townships. In 1845, Defiance County was formed from lands that were part of Williams County, plus the northern half of Auglaize Township. It was at this time that four sections of Emerald Township were transferred to Auglaize Township.

Settlement of Paulding County was slow, due to the difficult living conditions. Farmers complained that they grew two crops a year - frogs and ice. Many residents suffered from the ague, a disease later determined to be malaria. The primary industries were based on the thick forests. Many timbers were floated up the Maumee River to be used as ship&#x27;s masts. The trees were so large that one man lived in a hollow tree. There were also many who earned money through the winter by crafting barrel staves with an adze.

George Washington had promoted the construction of canals to provide interior transportation for the fledgling nation. Once the Erie Canal was opened in 1825, entrepreneurs promoted other canals, including the Miami and Erie Canal and the Wabash and Erie Canal. The Miami and Erie ran from Lake Erie to the Little Miami River near Cincinnati, through Paulding County, and the Wabash and Erie Canal went west into Indiana, meeting the Miami and Erie in Junction, a community in Auglaize township. The canal excitement was so great that people were leaving Fort Wayne, Indiana for Junction, feeling that it had a much brighter future. Canal workers choosing Paulding County as their tax home built the county&#x27;s population to 25,000 people in 1835, a number it has never approached since.

The combined canal system was the largest canal system in the world, but was profitable for only a short period. The canal was useless in winter, and the banks were constantly caving in, requiring constant dredging to remain passable. To protect the banks, canal boats had to operate at extremely slow speed. The canal system started being abandoned even before it was completely built. The coming of the railroad quickly supplanted the canals as the primary means of long-haul travel.

A relic of this era is the Furnace Farm near Cecil. Ore was brought in by canal, where it was turned into iron using the ample local fuel. One furnace remains, where it was allowed to cool without being emptied, there being no point in pouring iron that could not be shipped economically to market.

Built in the 1910s, the Paulding County Carnegie Library was the first Carnegie library to serve an entire county instead of a single city. In addition to the library, Andrew Carnegie matched local funds to install a pipe organ in what is now known as Paulding United Methodist Church.

In the early 20th century, Paulding had the highest unsolved murder rate of any county in the USA. The Purple Gang was thought to be exporting the corpses of their victims to the rural countryside, where they could be dumped without being seen. The sheriff argued that they were not local people, not murdered locally, and it was not worth spending large sums of tax dollars on what was essentially a littering problem.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

The center of the county is 723 feet above sea level, and the rest of the county does not vary much from that. The land is the most level of any county in the state, and plats look like a checkerboard, with roads every mile. This level terrain resulted in Paulding County being entirely within the Great Black Swamp, unlike any other.

The county contains U.S. Routes 127, 24, and 30 (the Lincoln Highway). There are two major rivers, the Auglaize and the Maumee, as well as numerous small creeks. The largest bodies of water are manmade ponds.

Paulding County is a Republican stronghold county in presidential elections. Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 was the last Democratic candidate to win the county. In the 1980 Senate election, while Democrat John Glenn won the state by 40 points, Paulding County was the only county he lost, by 5.5 points, after winning it by 24 points in his previous election where he carried all counties. However, the county would back Glenn again in his last two elections in 1986 and 1992.
















==Education==
In 1971, the Ohio Board of Education revoked the charters of Payne, Blue Creek, Grover Hill and Auglaize-Brown school districts. Blue Creek was itself the merger of Latty and Haviland schools only a few years prior. Payne, Blue Creek, and Grover Hill merged to form the Wayne Trace school district, and Auglaize-Brown joined Paulding Exempted Village Schools.
* Antwerp Local School District 
* Paulding Exempted Village School District 
* Wayne Trace Local School District 
* Vantage Career Center 

In the late 1950s, Paulding Exempted Village Schools enacted a pay-as-you-go tax for school construction, designed to reduce overall taxes by paying cash for school construction rather than paying high interest rates on bonds. The pay-as-you-go concept has been adopted in a number of local government units in Ohio.

With students from kindergarten to high school at one location, the Paulding campus of PEVS is one of the largest schools in the state.

==Interesting facts==
The Paulding County motto of &quot;No Compromise&quot; came from a banner carried by participants in the Reservoir War.

Paulding County was the first county in the US to receive funding from steel magnate Andrew Carnegie to build a library. Carnegie also matched funds to purchase the pipe organ in the Paulding Methodist Church.

Judge Calvin L. Noble of Paulding County spent the better part of his life as a Paulding County resident. His claim to fame is that he changed the name of the city of Cleaveland, Ohio to Cleveland. Earlier in life, as a printer, he founded the &quot;Cleaveland Advertiser&quot;. As the name was slightly too long to fit atop the page, he omitted the one letter.

Paulding County was the last county in the United States with no providers offering coverage through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act policies on the government&#x27;s health insurance exchange. In August 2017, CareSources announced plans to sell healthcare through the exchange.

<text>Monroe County is a county located on the eastern border of the U.S. state of Ohio, across the Ohio River from West Virginia. As of 2023, the population was 13,153, making it the second-least populous county in Ohio. Its county seat is Woodsfield. The county was created in 1813 and later organized in 1815.

==History==

Monroe County was formed on January 28, 1813, from portions of Belmont, Guernsey and Washington counties. It was named after James Monroe, the U.S. Secretary of State when the county was formed, and later fifth President of the United States. When organized, the county&#x27;s eastern border was with the state of Virginia. This portion of the state seceded from Virginia during the American Civil War, being admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia. The largely rural county reached its peak of population in the 19th century, before urbanization drew people into and near cities for work and other opportunities. It is still a center of Amish population and farms.

In 1891, West Virginia&#x27;s Sistersville Field was discovered to extend into Monroe County. By 1901, 300 wells near Woodsfield, Ohio, were producing 55,000 barrels of oil a month.

On or about December 20, 2011, ExxonMobil, a New Jersey petroleum company, via its subsidiary XTO Energy, acquired 20,056 acres of Monroe County Utica Shale gas leases from Beck Energy.

<doc id="93050" wikidata="Q485549" url="?curid=93050" title="Mercer County, Ohio">
<text>Mercer County is located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 42,528. Its county seat is Celina. The county was created in 1820 and later organized in 1824. It is named for Hugh Mercer, an officer in the American Revolutionary War.

Mercer County comprises the Celina, Ohio Micropolitan Statistical Area

==History==

Mercer County was created in 1820 from land that had been attached to Darke and Shelby counties. Land south of the Greenville Treaty Line was still part of Darke County. An act establishing and fully organizing Mercer County took place on January 2, 1824. In 1837 Van Wert County was detached and the county line established is the current northern border of Mercer County. In 1839 Celina was established as the seat of Mercer County; St. Marys was the previous seat. In 1848 the area south of the Greenville Treaty Line to the current southern county line, was attached. When Auglaize County was formed, Mercer County&#x27;s eastern border was moved west with the exception of the area south of the Greenville Treaty Line. This created the sharp point at Mercer County&#x27;s southeast corner and was the last county line modification.

In the mid to late 1800s, Mercer County became home to many German immigrant farming families. Many of these German Americans had immigrated from northwestern Germany.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water. The entire county has an elevation difference of less than 300 feet. The highest point is on the southern county line at 1071 feet above sea level. This is in proximity to the head waters for the Wabash River. The lowest point in the county is 780 feet above sea level. This point is located on the northern county line where the St. Marys River crosses over.

===Drainage basins===
Mercer County has two rivers running through it; the Wabash and the St. Marys. The Wabash watershed is part of the Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s watershed. The St. Marys watershed is part of Lake Erie&#x27;s watershed. Creeks between these two watersheds are within a mile of each other at some places in Mercer County. The summit line that divides the drainage basins is known as the St. Lawrence Continental Divide

====Beaver Creek====
Beaver Creek is the longest and largest creek in Mercer County. It stretches 19.7 miles and has two sections. The first section begins in southern farmland in the county and flows through the town of Montezuma, Ohio and into Grand Lake St. Marys. The other section of the creek begins as a spillway and empties into the Wabash River. Beaver Creek was originally one piece, but was split into two sections after the construction of Grand Lake. The creeks&#x27; spillway, and last section, has been the subject of controversy and multimillion-dollar lawsuits. Farmers along Beaver Creek claim their land floods because of the spillway that was put up in 1997, replacing the previous spillway, built in 1913.
==Government==
Mercer County has a 3-member Board of County Commissioners that oversee the various County departments, similar to all but 2 of the 88 Ohio counties. Mercer County&#x27;s elected commissioners are: Jerry Laffin, Rick Muhlenkamp, and David Buschur.

<text>Meigs County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,210. Its county seat is Pomeroy. The county is named for Return J. Meigs Jr., the fourth Governor of Ohio.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water. The Ohio River forms the eastern and southern boundaries of the county, the other side of which is located in West Virginia.

Meigs County lies in the Appalachian Plateau physiographic region of the Appalachian Mountains. The landscape is considered to be anywhere from gently rolling to rugged, typical of a dissected plateau. Elevations range from asl (above sea level) in the southwest to about asl in the far south central part of the county along the Ohio River. The majority of Meigs County is drained by two subwatersheds of the Ohio River, Shade River and Leading Creek. Another stream of note is Raccoon Creek, which flows through a small area of the northwestern corner of the county.

Coal mining, both strip and underground, has been an important industry in Meigs County since the late 19th century, although mining of all types largely ceased by the 1990s. The effects of mining are still readily seen on the landscape today. Features such as high walls, spoil piles, and irregular topography are still prevalent. Many tributaries in the Leading Creek basin are plagued by acid mine drainage and sedimentation.

In 2009, Gatling, Ohio LLC invested $75 million to open a new coal mine and coal prep plant near Racine. It is capable of employing 120 to 150 miners, and is capable of producing 3.5 million marketable tons of coal per year.

===Climate===
Meigs County&#x27;s climate is considered humid continental, with warm to hot, humid summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Precipitation averages 41&quot; annually, spread evenly throughout the year. High July temperatures average in the upper 80s F, while lows average in the low to mid 60s F. Temperatures above 90* F in the summer are common. January highs average about 40* F, with lows in the lower 20s. Temperatures around or even below 0* F occur during most winters. Snowfall averages 20–25&quot;, falling between late November and the first week of April.

The Ohio River creates a microclimate in its valley where temperatures tend to be moderated by the river, hence resulting in longer growing seasons compared to the rest of the county. Other microclimates, known as frost hollows or frost pockets, exist throughout the county in small isolated valleys. Nocturnal temperatures are often several degrees colder than the surrounding terrain.

It was won four times by Democrats between 1964 and 1996 (although Bill Clinton who carried Meigs twice did so only with pluralities) but has become powerfully Republican again since 2000. Barack Obama reached 39% in this county despite his statewide victories in 2008 or 2012, but Donald Trump reached a record 72.8% in the county in 2016 owing to his strength in rural counties nationwide.

==Politics==
Prior to 1940, Marion County supported Democrats in presidential elections, only voting for Republican candidates five times from 1856 to 1936. But starting with the 1940 election, the county has become a Republican stronghold in presidential elections with Lyndon B. Johnson being the only Democrat to win since, but Bill Clinton came within just 630 votes of winning it in 1996.
















==Government==
Marion County is represented by two members of the Ohio House of Representatives, as it is split between the 86th and 87th Ohio House Districts. State Representative Tracy Richardson, elected in 2018, represents the 86th Ohio House district, and Riordan T. McClain, appointed in 2018, serves the 87th Ohio House District.

The entirety of Marion County lies within the 26th Ohio Senate District, currently represented by Bill Reineke, who defeated Democrat Craig Swartz in the 2020 Ohio Senate election.

<text>Mahoning County is located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 228,614. Its county seat and largest city is Youngstown. The county is named after the Mahoning River and was formed on March 1, 1846; the 83rd county in Ohio. 

Present-day Mahoning County was part of Trumbull and Columbiana counties until 1846, when the counties were redefined and Mahoning County was established as a new county. Mahoning County is part of the Youngstown–Warren, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In the year 1600, Mahoning County was likely divided between two nations of Native Americans, the Erie people in the east and the Whittlesey culture in the west. It is unknown where the actual boundaries between these cultures lay, though the nearest confirmed Whittlesey settlement was at Cleveland and the nearest confirmed Erie settlement was just barely across the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, in Ashtabula County. The Erie were an Iroquoian people who likely arrived sometime between the years 1100-1300 AD, after chasing out an older nation of &quot;Mound Builders.&quot; The Whittlesey were likely Algonquian, but lived in longhouses rather than the traditional Algonquian wigwams.

Following the Beaver Wars, when the Iroquois Confederacy declared war on many of the tribes of the Great Lakes region over several decades and destroyed them, new tribes moved into this area. The tribes who shared the resources of the Mahoning Valley included the Seneca, Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, and Wyandot. The Seneca and Wyandot were Iroquoians, and the Lenape and Shawnee were Algonquians. As northeast Ohio later came to be under control of the settlers as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, all tribes were pushed further westward or southward, before eventually being removed from Ohio by the United States in the early-mid 1800s.

Some former known Native American sites that existed in Mahoning County include the council rock and the North Benton burial mound. Council Rock was where the Shawnee and Lenape were known to gather for collective holiday celebrations, religion ceremonies and political meetings and once sat in the center of Youngstown. Though the rock was moved long ago, it still rests in what is now Lincoln Park. The North Benton burial mound was once located on the outskirts of North Benton and was removed by archeologists. It was attributed to the Hopewell culture, but contained unique features, such as sculptures of constellations made of white rocks and clay laid out at ground level and a pit full of mixed human bones in one corner. It shared features with two other burial mounds found and excavated in Kent, Ohio and Warren, Pennsylvania represents a completely unique style of burial mound in Ohio.

Prior to its formation of a county in 1846, Mahoning County was a destination for a family of Huguenot refugees in the early 1800s.

In the 1900s, Youngstown was a hub for the American steel industry and for local mob groups, who gained their power through the liquor and gambling industries during prohibition, remaining a key safety issue for the region until the 1970s. It was also the home to Warner Theatre, where the Warner Bros. film studio got its start and remained a hub for early film and television for decades. An extensive German community used to exist in the township of Berlin, until pressure to fully assimilate after the World Wars against Germany ended it. Brier Hill Pizza was invented in Youngstown&#x27;s Brier Hill neighborhood and is considered a local delicacy.

==Politics==
Mahoning County is historically Democratic-leaning, voting for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election from 1976 through 2016. Between 1976 and 2012 Mahoning County voted Democratic by at least a margin of 11 percentage points for every election. Circa 1972 to 2016, the majority of voters in Mahoning County and Youngstown chose Democratic Party candidates in U.S. presidential elections. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county over Donald Trump by 3.3 percent, the smallest margin since 1972; in 2012, Barack Obama carried the county over Mitt Romney by a solid 28.3 percent.

However in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Ohio, the majority in those areas selected Donald Trump. Andrew Gumbell of &quot;The Observer&quot; stated that Trump gained popularity from 2017 to 2020 even though the Youngstown economy declined in the same period; Trump in 2017 made statements saying that he will revive the area economically. Donald Trump flipped the county Republican for the first time since Richard Nixon&#x27;s national landslide victory in 1972, carrying it by a margin of 1.9 percentage points.

In the 2024 U.S. presidential election in Ohio, Trump won the same areas by 13 points. Gumbell cited &quot;disillusioned working-class voters&quot; and their feelings for the rising popularity of Trump in the area; according to Gumbell, the voters believe that Trump would abolish a system that disadvantages them, but that the majority of area voters do not believe that, in Gumbell&#x27;s words, that Trump will &quot;fix everything or believe him when he says he will.&quot; Trump carried by the county by 9.37%, the largest margin of victory for a Republican since 1928.

At the statewide level, Mahoning County generally votes Democratic as well. Since 1970, the county has only voted Republican three times at the gubernatorial level – in the landslide elections of 1994, 2014, and 2022.

Between 2012 and 2022, Mahoning County was split between Ohio&#x27;s 13th congressional district and Ohio&#x27;s 6th congressional district. After the 2020 redistricting cycle, the county was moved entirely into the 6th district.

The county was named for Robert Lucas, 12th governor of Ohio, in 1835 during his second term. Its establishment provoked the Toledo War conflict with the Michigan Territory, which claimed some of its area. Lucas County is the central county of the Toledo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

On August 20, 1794, near the site of the present-day town of Maumee, American forces led by General Anthony Wayne won a decisive victory over allied Indian forces at the Battle of Fallen Timbers after years of conflict in what was known as the Northwest Indian War. The defeat of the Native forces resulted in the opening of the entire Northwest Territory for white settlement. Northwest Ohio was occupied chiefly by villages and bands of the Odawa people, who had trading relations with the French at Fort Detroit since 1701. Other Odawa were located in southeast Michigan and further north on the peninsula. They ceded much of that territory in the Treaty of Greenville but retained control of lands along the Maumee River until after the War of 1812. The last Odawa band, that of Ottokee, grandson of Chief Pontiac, left the Maumee River area for Kansas in 1839.
Lucas County was established in 1835. At that time, both Ohio and Michigan Territory claimed sovereignty over a region along their border (see Toledo War). When Michigan petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, it sought to include the disputed territory within its bounds. In response, the Ohio General Assembly formally organized part of the area as Lucas County, naming it after the incumbent governor of Ohio, Robert Lucas.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (43%) is water. It is the fourth-smallest county in Ohio by land area. Much of the county lies within what was at the time of its establishment, a vast network of forests, wetlands, and grasslands known as the Great Black Swamp.

Like most populous urban counties, Lucas County is a Democratic stronghold. The only Republicans to win a majority or plurality in the county since 1932 have been Thomas E. Dewey in 1944, Dwight D. Eisenhower in both 1952 and 1956, and Ronald Reagan in 1980 (plurality) and 1984. Although Ronald Reagan carried the county twice, no other Republican has won the county in the last 50 years. In 1972, for instance, it was one of only two counties in the entire state that supported George McGovern.

In the last five presidential elections, the Democratic candidate&#x27;s margin of victory has ranged from 12.4% in 2024, the narrowest margin in the county since 1988, to 30.5% in the case of Barack Obama. The entirety of Lucas County, including Toledo, lies in Ohio&#x27;s 9th congressional district, and it is represented by Marcy Kaptur, who is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

== Politics ==
Lorain County used to lean Democratic in more recent presidential elections, voting for the Democratic candidate for president from 1988 to 2012. In 2016, however, the county was almost swept up as part of the unexpected Republican surge in the Rust Belt; Donald Trump came within 131 votes of winning the county. In 2020, Trump flipped the county Republican by a narrow majority, becoming the first Republican to capture the county since Ronald Reagan in 1984. In 2024, Trump won the county with 52.12% of the vote, the highest percentage for a Republican since 1972. Despite this, the county also voted for Democrat Sherrod Brown in the 2024 Senate election, making it the only county in the state to vote for both Trump and Brown in 2024.

==Industry and business==

=== An industrial history of Licking County ===
Since Licking County&#x27;s establishment in 1808, businesses and industries have served as a source of employment, generating income and promoting economic growth. Notable industries include manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, health care and social assistance, accommodation and food services. Manufacturing, agriculture, and services prove to be the major sectors of Licking County&#x27;s industry.

==== Manufacturing ====
Manufacturing is one of the largest industry sectors in Licking County. Major establishments and advancements have been made by manufacturing facilities in the county by renowned companies or corporations, namely &quot;Invenergy, Armstrong World Industries, Intel,&quot; and &quot;Atkore&quot;. These investments have provided Licking County residents with a diverse range of employment opportunties and facilitated its economic growth. However, in the past many other successful manufacturing companies have come to a close, such as &quot;Longaberger, Fyrepel, Meritor plant in Heath,&quot; and &quot;E.T. Rugg&quot;. This shows the competitiveness of economic activity in the county. The glass-making industry, which has been established since the late 19th century from Newark with natural gas supplies, sand quarry, and cheap labor, is also a significant manufacturing sector in Licking County.

==== Agriculture ====
Agriculture is regarded as a traditional cornerstone of Licking County. It secures the earnings and living of the residents by offering a variety of crops and livestock, such as corn, wheat, cattle, and goats. &quot;Charles Metz and Brothers Meat Market,&quot; a local agricultural company located in Newark, is a well known meat provider for regional butchers and markets. &quot;Weiant Greenhouses&quot; was another local company that grew lettuce. It covered five acres of glass structures, becoming one of the largest greenhouses in Ohio and providing vegetables to three nearby states during its time. Unfortunately, it came to a close after a destructive storm in 1978. While modern farmers have multiple advantages such as better agricultural equipment, pesticides and fertilizers, many have encountered challenges due to an increase in the cost of producing crops and raising livestock, and a declining payout as well.

From housing and dining services to entertainment services, a variety of services have been available in Licking County.

== Opioid and overdose crisis ==
In line with national and regional trends, opioid misuse led to increased rates of overdose and fatalities in Licking County over the last two decades. Opioids, which encompass a variety of drugs, are often used for pain relief. However, when opioids are taken in large doses, they can be fatal. Synthetic varieties of opioids, such as fentanyl, have been listed as one of the main contributors to the ongoing crisis. Evidence indicates that the opioid and overdose crises in Licking County have been affected by unemployment in the region, economic inequalities, and local, state, and federal responses to the crises. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, one director of a residential treatment center attributed isolation to the rise in overdose deaths across Licking County. Others have attributed the rise in overdose deaths to a rise in fentanyl and its analogues in the drug supply. 

===Statistics===

Since 2001, unintentional drug overdose deaths in Licking County have increased. Between 2001 and 2010, the number of unintentional overdose fatalities per year ranged from four to 24. From 2011 to 2020, annual overdose deaths ranged from 13 to 47 per year. In 2022, 58 people died in Licking County due to unintetional drug overdoses. Licking County Memorial Health Systems found out that when focusing on fentanyl related deaths, the number increased by over 1000% between 2014 and 2018, from 2 to 21 deaths. The Licking County Health Department reported that fentanyl played a role in nearly three quarters of overdose deaths in 2020 and 2021. 

=== Overdose Mapping ===

In 2020, the Licking County Health Department introduced a new overdose mapping system that began tracking fatal and nonfatal overdose cases in the region. The system was designed, in part, to identify surges in overdoses that could then allow for more efficient and effective distribution of naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdose. It is possible that the recent increases in overdoses throughout Licking County may be the result of more overdoses being reported across the county as a result of overdose mapping.

=== Demographics ===

In 2021, of the 47 opioid related death, the primary group affected was white males between the ages 25-44. Annual data from the Licking County overdose fatality review illustrates 72% of overdoses in 2021 were male, while the remaining 28% were female. The most affected age range was 35-44 years old, with 15 deaths, followed closely by those aged 25-34, with 14 deaths. Additionally, 94% of deaths in 2021 were White/Caucasian and 6% were Black/African American. Regarding the level of education of those affected, 59.6% were high school graduates or had a GED, while 17% did not graduate high school. Additionally, 12.8% had a college education without a degree, and 8.5% held a college undergraduate degree.

=== Refusal of Syringe Services Program ===
Syringe services programs (SSPs) offer drug users clean injection equipment and often other services, like referrals to treatment facilities, access to naloxone, and screenings for disease. Evidence indicates that SSPs help prevent the spread of disease, increase the likelihood that drug users will enter treatment, and decrease overdose deaths. Unsanitary syringe use has been a cause for the Hepatitis-C cases in the County. Despite these facts, in 2019, the Licking County Health Department unanimously voted against implementing a syringe exchange program in the county, and in 2024 it indicated that it was not willing to revisit its decision. Various organizations have taken issue with the Health Department&#x27;s, decision, such as Licking County&#x27;s branch of OhioCAN. 

===Resources available===

Various programs have emerged in Licking County to address the opioid and overdose crises.The Licking County Linkages Program helps individuals recovering from substance addiction by providing health care. In addition, their goals also revolve around reducing stigmas surrounding substance abuse as well as informing the general public of the dangers of drug consumption. Other services throughout Licking County include disposal of unwanted pills which can be done at several police stations within the county.

<doc id="93060" wikidata="Q485615" url="?curid=93060" title="Lawrence County, Ohio">
<text>Lawrence County is the southernmost county of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,240. Its county seat is Ironton. The county was created in 1815 and later organized in 1817. It is named for James Lawrence, the naval officer famous for the line &quot;do not give up the ship&quot;.
Lawrence County is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==History==
The earliest European-American settlers, Luke Kelly and his family, and May Keyser, settled at Hanging Rock along the Ohio River in 1796, having migrated from the east. Lawrence County was formed on December 20, 1816, from parts of Gallia and Scioto counties, with the county seat named as Burlington. In 1851, the county seat was moved from Burlington to Ironton. A new courthouse was built at that time. It burned in 1857. The present Lawrence County Courthouse was built in 1908.

Men from Lawrence County served in the Mexican–American War, with at least one having died during that conflict. By 1862, about 3,200 of Lawrence County&#x27;s men were soldiers in the Union Army in the American Civil War. During World War I, 2,200 of Lawrence County&#x27;s men served in the armed forces, and 99 died.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.9%) is water. It is the southernmost county in the state of Ohio and part of Appalachian Ohio.

==Demographics==
===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 62,319 people, 24,732 households, and 17,807 families living in the county. The population density was . There were 27,189 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 96.55% White, 2.09% Black or African American, 0.18% Native American, 0.19% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.11% from other races, and 0.88% from two or more races. 0.57% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 24,732 households, out of which 32.00% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.00% were married couples living together, 11.90% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.00% were non-families. 24.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.20% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the county, the population was spread out, with 24.50% under the age of 18, 8.60% from 18 to 24, 28.00% from 25 to 44, 24.50% from 45 to 64, and 14.40% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 92.20 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.40 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $29,127, and the median income for a family was $35,308. Males had a median income of $30,622 versus $20,961 for females. The per capita income for the county was $14,678. About 15.10% of families and 18.90% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.30% of those under age 18 and 12.90% of those age 65 or over.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 62,450 people, 24,974 households, and 17,405 families living in the county. The population density was . There were 27,603 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 95.9% white, 2.0% black or African American, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% American Indian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.4% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 0.7% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 18.0% were American, 15.4% were German, 12.9% were Irish, and 10.8% were English. In Lawrence County, less than 1% of people who self-identify as &quot;Irish&quot; are Catholic. Scholars believe this is part of a trend in which people are vaguely aware that at least some of their ancestors come from Ireland, but that population is primarily of &quot;Scots-Irish&quot; or &quot;Ulster Scots&quot; ancestry, and those identifying as &quot;Irish&quot; are simply unaware of the distinction. Those citing &quot;American&quot; ancestry in Lawrence County are of overwhelmingly English extraction, most English Americans identify simply as American because their ancestors have been in North America for centuriesin some cases since the 1600s.

Of the 24,974 households, 32.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.0% were married couples living together, 13.2% had a female householder with no husband present, 30.3% were non-families, and 26.1% of all households were made up of individuals.

The per capita income for the county was $19,452. About 15.2% of families and 19.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.0% of those under age 18 and 11.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Politics==
Lawrence County tends to support the Republican Party in presidential elections. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to win the county, in 1996 – a distinction shared with 16 other Ohio counties, mostly in this region. Despite this fact, Democrats continued to crack 40% in election years. This changed in 2016, as with much of Appalachia, when Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 26.03% was the lowest in nearly 90 nears. Four years later, Joe Biden barely did better.

<text>Lake County is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 232,603. Its county seat is Painesville, and its largest city is Mentor.

The county was established on March 6, 1840, from land given by Cuyahoga and Geauga counties. Its name is derived from its location on the southern shore of Lake Erie and the fact that the majority of the county’s land lies beneath Lake Erie. Lake County is part of the Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The land that became Lake County was home to the indigenous Erie people prior to the arrival of the French in the region during the early 1600s and was considered by the French to be part of their Colony of New France. After France&#x27;s defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763, France ceded the area to Great Britain, and the area became part of the Province of Quebec through the Quebec Act of 1774. Following the American Revolutionary War, it became part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory, then was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795. It was separated out of Geauga County in March 1840.

Although today the county is mostly suburban, Lake County was once known as a rural country retreat for wealthy Cleveland residents. During the early 1900s, many wealthy families in Cleveland maintained large estates in the county for use as their summer homes.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (77%) is water. It is Ohio&#x27;s smallest county by land area but the third-largest by total area, with said area owing to land beneath the lake (which is owned by the county).

The county’s coast line along Lake Erie spans 31 miles. Additionally, Lake County has an international border with Ontario (across Lake Erie).

Lake County has traditionally been known as a &quot;purple&quot; or &quot;swing&quot; county within the state. A 2008 analysis of Ohio presidential election results from 1960 to 2004 found no other county more closely followed Ohio&#x27;s statewide voting pattern. Although it did not always vote with the winner, it had consistently been closer to the winner&#x27;s Ohio vote percentage than any other Ohio county. More recently, however, the county has trended more strongly Republican than the state as a whole. For example, in 2020 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the county by nearly a fourteen point margin while winning the state as a whole by only eight points.

<text>The Color of Truth is a book by Kai Bird, published by Touchstone Books in June 2000. Subtitled &quot;McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms&quot;, it is a biography focusing on the Bundys&#x27; role in American foreign policy, especially in the progression of the Vietnam War.

Bird argues evidence presented in &quot;The Color of Truth&quot; reveals the brothers &quot;registered deep doubts about the American enterprise in Vietnam and did so far earlier than most historians had thought,&quot; although they never ceased promoting it during their time with the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He portrays them as complicated men who served their country, and headed many progressive causes during and after the war, and attributes their refusal to take a hard line against a war they morally opposed to their fear of risking political capital from the anti-communist Vital Center.

<text>Jefferson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,249. Its county seat is Steubenville. The county is named for Thomas Jefferson, who was vice president at the time of its creation.

Jefferson County is part of the Weirton–Steubenville, WV–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton, PA–WV–OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Jefferson County was organized on July 29, 1797, by proclamation of Governor Arthur St. Clair, six years before Ohio was granted statehood. Its boundaries were originally quite large, including all of northeastern Ohio east of the Cuyahoga River, but it was divided and redrawn several times before assuming its present-day boundaries in 1833, after the formation of neighboring Carroll County.

In 1786, the United States built Fort Steuben to protect the government surveyors mapping the land west of the Ohio River. When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement La Belle. When the county was created in 1797, La Belle was selected as the County seat. The town was subsequently renamed Steubenville, in honor of the abandoned fort.

During the first half of the 19th century, Steubenville was primarily a port town, and the rest of the county consisted of small villages and farms. However, in 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft, resulting in Jefferson County becoming one of the leading centers of the new Industrial Revolution.

==Geography==

<text>Jackson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 32,653. Its county seat is Jackson. The county is named for Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812 who was subsequently elected President of the United States. It is known as &quot;The Little Wales of Ohio.&quot; Jackson County comprises the Jackson, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Jackson County is north of the Ohio River in eastern Ohio, an area that was long occupied by various tribes of Native Americans. Evidence of this era in the Ohio Valley is found in the area&#x27;s large burial and ceremonial mounds and petroglyphs including the Leo Petroglyph.

Tribes that inhabited the area in the Colonial period included with Mingo, Lenape, and Shawnee. Westward expansion by American pioneers displaced the Indigenous People who were killed in wars or relocated to the Great Plains and placed on reservations following the passage of the Indian Removal Act. The pioneer settlers cleared the land for farming and developed industries around which towns and cities grew.

Iron ore was discovered in southern Ohio in the mid-19th century. The combination of deposits of ore and vast stands of old-growth forests made the Hanging Rock Iron Region ideally suited for the iron industry. The Jefferson Iron Furnace was constructed in 1854. It met the growing demand for iron in the developing United States of America. The importance of the furnaces in the Hanging Rock region grew tremendously during the American Civil War. Iron produced in Jackson County was sold to manufacturers under the trademark, &quot;Anchor&quot;. This iron was used to build the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, an ironclad warship made famous by its contest against the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, a Confederate ironclad sometimes known as the &quot;Merrimack&quot;, at the Battle of Hampton Roads.

The era of iron production in Jackson County began to wane in the years following the Civil War. Demand for iron outstripped the resources in the Hanging Rock Iron Region. Ore deposits had been cleared and what remained was minimal and difficult to extract. Also much of the forested land had been cleared to provide charcoal to fire the furnaces. A combination of a lack of ore and charcoal helped bring about the end of the iron era. Remnants of the Jefferson Iron Furnaces are found in Jackson Lake State Park.

Other industries that were in the area included coal mining and salt mining. Over a million tons of coal were mined in 1888. Jackson County was the second leading coal producing county in the state during the coal mining era. Salt mines along Salt Creek were set aside &quot;by Congress for the use of the state to secure the salt.&quot; Indian tribes also used the area and came from great distances to gather salt.

<text>Huron County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,565. Its county seat is Norwalk. The county was created in 1809 and later organized in 1815. Huron County is included in the Norwalk, OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Huron County was named in honor of the Huron Indians (more correctly called the Wyandot), an Iroquoian-speaking tribe who occupied large areas in the Great Lakes region. The word &quot;Huron&quot; may be French, although this origin is disputed.

In the late 18th century, this area was in the U.S. Northwest Territory, part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in a sub-region called the Firelands. Connecticut had originally claimed the land as part of its original colony, then afterward wanted to use it to grant land to veterans in lieu of cash payment for their service in the war. In 1795, the Connecticut Land Company purchased this land for resale and development. Later, it was solely administered by the &quot;Fire Land Company&quot;. Many of the townships in Huron County are named for places in Connecticut.

<text>Holmes County is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 44,223. Its county seat is Millersburg. The county was formed in 1824 from portions of Coshocton, Tuscarawas and Wayne counties and organized the following year. It was named after Andrew Holmes, an officer killed in the War of 1812.

Holmes County, which was about 42% Amish in 2010, and 48% in 2020, has the highest concentration of Amish in the world, which draws many visitors to the county. The Holmes Amish settlement, which also includes Amish from neighboring counties, is the second-largest in the world after Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and numbered 37,770 people in 2021.

==History==

Holmes County was formed on January 20, 1824, from portions of Coshocton, Tuscarawas and Wayne counties. It was named after Major Andrew Holmes, who was killed in action at the Battle of Mackinac Island.

In 1863, during the Civil War, numerous small anti-draft riots took place, mainly in the German-speaking areas. Holmes County at the time was a Democratic stronghold, dominated by its Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, along with many recent German immigrants. With the passage of the Conscription Act in March 1863, Holmes County politicians denounced both Congress and President Lincoln as despotic, saying that forced military service was little different from slavery. Conscription had been common in their former German homelands, and it was one of the reasons they had moved to America. Violent protests broke out in June, and they continued until the Union Army marched into the county and declared martial law. Stephen E. Towne in 2019 using archival records argues that many of the resisters belonged to secret organizations that opposed Union tactics to defeat the Confederacy.

In the spring of 1892, a Black man from Mt. Vernon or Wooster, Ohio, whose name remains unknown, was walking through the county. After he had been in town for a few days, a group of white people decided to lynch him because he “lingered about people’s doorsteps and angered them in various ways.” On April 1, 1892, a mob gathered after nightfall, abducted the man, and hanged him from a tree in the public square in front of the county courthouse.

==Politics==
Prior to 1944, Holmes County was a stronghold of the Democratic Party in presidential elections, with every Democratic presidential candidate from 1856 to 1940, except for Al Smith, carrying the county. The county has since become a Republican stronghold, with Lyndon B. Johnson being the only Democrat since 1940 to carry it, in his 1964 landslide, although Harry S. Truman came within just 16 votes of winning it in 1948.

The high Amish population means that a large proportion of residents in Holmes County do not vote, even compared to turnout standards in much of the United States. These low figures are likely due to the Amish&#x27;s tendency to abstain from politics.

==Amish community==

A large Amish community of about 36,000 exists in Northeast-Central Ohio, centered on Holmes County and extending into surrounding counties. The Holmes Old Order Amish affiliation, with 140 church districts out of 221 in the Holmes County Amish settlement in 2009, is the main and dominant Amish affiliation. Holmes County houses the highest percentage of Amish of any U.S. county, currently 42 percent of the population, and experts speculate that by 2027, Holmes County could become the first county in the US where more than half the residents were Amish. The Amish &amp; Mennonite Heritage Center in Berlin explains traditional ways of the Amish and provides an illustrated history for visitors in its 10-foot-by-265-foot mural.

The overall Amish population of the area, centered on Holmes County, is the largest Amish community in the world. Called locally &quot;Amish Country&quot;, it draws many visitors to the county, thus making tourism an important sector of the local economy.

<text>A New Kind of Science is a book by Stephen Wolfram, published by his company Wolfram Research under the imprint Wolfram Media in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as cellular automata. Wolfram calls these systems &quot;simple programs&quot; and argues that the scientific philosophy and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==
=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; (&quot;NKS&quot;) is twofold: that the nature of computation must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the physical world.

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram&#x27;s &quot;new kind of science&quot; is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary computer programs. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, among others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; mobile automata; Turing machines in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; recursive functions; nested recursive functions; combinators; tag systems; register machines; and reversal-addition. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of human language.
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant proportion of them can produce great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program&#x27;s definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of emergence. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program&#x27;s rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a brute-force search through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be universal computers. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as thermodynamic behavior, continuum behavior, conserved quantities, percolation, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and others. They have been used as models of traffic, material fracture, crystal growth, biological growth, and various sociological, geological, and ecological phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall complexity. &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any complex system.

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often-complex behavior, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like physics or chemistry. The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. Some forms of production are also in some ways unique to this field of study—for example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another type of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the &quot;NKS&quot; framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. But in general, Wolfram&#x27;s idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science, grounded equally in both abstraction and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology &quot;NKS&quot; advocates is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of reverse engineering our theories from observation, we can enumerate systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of &quot;NKS&quot; is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing principle of science. For instance, he argues that the concept of &quot;computational irreducibility&quot; (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be &quot;reduced&quot;), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional mathematical models. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the principle of computational equivalence (PCE): the principle says that systems found in the natural world can perform computations up to a maximal (&quot;universal&quot;) level of computational power. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating input and outputs from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions that he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important of these is an explanation of why we experience randomness and complexity: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like the concept of &quot;heat&quot;, but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the &quot;normal science&quot; of the &quot;NKS&quot; paradigm.

===Applications and results===
&quot;NKS&quot; contains a number of specific results and ideas, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where &quot;NKS&quot; introduces what was, during the book&#x27;s composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal Turing machine, and the shortest axiom for propositional calculus. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like phase transitions, conserved quantities, continuum behavior, and thermodynamics that are familiar from traditional science. Simple computational models of natural systems like shell growth, fluid turbulence, and phyllotaxis are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a holistic way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform evolutionary theory, SETI, free will, computational complexity theory, and philosophical fields like ontology, epistemology, and even postmodernism.

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may explain how free will is possible in a nominally deterministic universe. He posits that the computational process in the brain of the being with free will is so complex that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility. Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being&#x27;s will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a number of results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the Turing completeness of the Rule 110 cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol universal Turing machine. Wolfram conjectures that a particular 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book&#x27;s fifth anniversary, Wolfram&#x27;s company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal. Alex Smith, a computer science student from Birmingham, UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram&#x27;s conjecture.

==Reception==

Periodicals gave &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; coverage, including articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and &quot;The Economist&quot;. Some scientists, including Cosma Shalizi and Scott Aaronson, criticized the book and perceived a fatal flaw—that simple systems such as cellular automata are not complex enough to describe the degree of complexity in evolved systems, and observed that Wolfram ignored the research categorizing the complexity of systems. Although critics accept Wolfram&#x27;s result showing universal computation, they view it as minor and dispute Wolfram&#x27;s claim of a paradigm shift. Others found that the work contained valuable insights and refreshing ideas. Wolfram addressed his critics in a series of blog posts.

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of &quot;NKS&quot; is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, &quot;NKS&quot; argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. But many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. &quot;NKS&quot; has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of &quot;NKS&quot; is that it does not follow established scientific methodology. For instance, &quot;NKS&quot; does not establish rigorous mathematical definitions, nor does it attempt to prove theorems; and most formulas and equations are written in Mathematica rather than standard notation. Along these lines, &quot;NKS&quot; has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that lack formal meaning. It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of complexity, particularly works on complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective. And it has been criticized for misrepresenting chaos theory.

===Utility===
&quot;NKS&quot; has been criticized for not providing specific results that are immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research. There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe and hence is of limited value. Steven Weinberg has pointed out that no real-world system has been satisfactorily explained using Wolfram&#x27;s methods. Mathematician Steven G. Krantz wrote, &quot;Just because Wolfram can cook up a cellular automaton that seems to produce the spot pattern on a leopard, may we safely conclude that he understands the mechanism by which the spots are produced on the leopard, or &quot;why&quot; the spots are there, or what function (evolutionary or mating or camouflage or other) they perform?&quot;

===Principle of computational equivalence (PCE)===
The principle of computational equivalence (PCE) has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent. Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.

===The fundamental theory (&quot;NKS&quot; Chapter 9)===
Wolfram&#x27;s speculations of a direction toward a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. Scott Aaronson, Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram&#x27;s methods cannot be compatible with both special relativity and Bell&#x27;s theorem violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of Bell tests.

Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse pioneered the idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that &quot;NKS&quot; tries to take these ideas as its own, but Wolfram&#x27;s model of the universe is a rewriting network, not a cellular automaton, as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.

In a 2002 review of &quot;NKS&quot;, the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist Steven Weinberg wrote, &quot;Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can&#x27;t resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It&#x27;s possible, but I can&#x27;t see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood.&quot;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram&#x27;s claim that natural selection is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led journalist Chris Lavers to say that Wolfram does not understand the theory of evolution.

===Originality===
&quot;NKS&quot; has been heavily criticized as not original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which &quot;NKS&quot; presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these is original to Wolfram; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the rule 110 cellular automaton is Turing complete, was not proven by Wolfram. Wolfram credits the proof to his research assistant Matthew Cook. But the book&#x27;s notes section acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists, citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in chaos theory and complex systems.

<text>Enki Bilal (born Enes Bilal; born 7 October 1951) is a French comic book creator and film director.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bilal was born in Belgrade, PR Serbia, Yugoslavia, to a Czech mother, Ana, who came to Belgrade as child from Karlovy Vary, and a Bosnian Muslim father, Muhamed Hamo Bilal, from Ljubuški, who had been Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s tailor. When he was five years old, his father managed to take a trip and stay in Paris as a political émigré. Enki and the rest of the family, his mother Ana and sister Enisa, stayed in Yugoslavia, and four years later they followed. Enki Bilal has no sense of belonging to any ethnic group and religion, nor is he obsessed with soil and roots. He said in one interview: &quot;I also feel Bosnian by my father&#x27;s origin, a Serb by my place of birth and a Croat by my relationship with a certain one to my childhood friends, not to mention my other Czech half, who I am inherited from mother&quot;.

===Education and career===
At age 14, he met René Goscinny and with his encouragement applied his talent to comics. He produced work for Goscinny&#x27;s Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot; in the 1970s, publishing his first story, &quot;Le Bol Maudit&quot;, in 1972.

In 1975, Bilal began working with script writer Pierre Christin on a series of dark and surreal tales, resulting in the body of work titled &quot;Légendes d&#x27;Aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;.

In 1983, Bilal was asked by film director Alain Resnais to collaborate on his film &quot;La vie est un roman&quot;, for which Bilal provided painted images that were incorporated in the &quot;medieval&quot; episodes of the film.

He is best known for the &quot;Nikopol&quot; trilogy (&quot;La Foire aux immortels&quot;, &quot;La Femme piège&quot; and &quot;Froid Équateur&quot;), which took more than a decade to complete. Bilal wrote the script and did the artwork. The final chapter, &quot;Froid Équateur&quot;, was chosen book of the year by the magazine &quot;Lire&quot; and is acknowledged by the inventor of chess boxing, Iepe Rubingh, as the inspiration for the sport.

&quot;Quatre?&quot; (2007), the last book in the &quot;Hatzfeld&quot; tetralogy, deals with the breakup of Yugoslavia from a future viewpoint. The first installment came in 1998 in the shape of &quot;Le Sommeil du Monstre&quot; opening with the main character, Nike, remembering the war in a series of traumatic flashbacks. The third chapter of the tetralogy is &quot;Rendez-vous à Paris&quot; (2006), which was the fifth best selling new comic of 2006, with 280,000 copies sold.

His cinematic career was revived with the expensive &quot;Immortel&quot;, his first attempt to adapt his books to the screen. The film divided critics, some panning the use of CGI characters but others seeing it as a faithful reinterpretation of the books.

On 13 May 2008 a video game based on the &quot;Nikopol&quot; trilogy was announced titled &quot;Nikopol: Secrets of the Immortals&quot;. Published in North America by Got Game Entertainment in August 2008, the game is a &quot;point and click&quot; adventure for the PC; however, the Lead Designer was Marc Rutschlé and not Bilal himself, who was the art designer, along with Yoshitaka Amano, for the video game &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot;.

In 2012, Bilal was featured in a solo exhibition at The Louvre. The exhibition, titled &quot;The Ghosts of the Louvre&quot;, ran from 20 December 2012 to 18 March 2013. The exhibition was organized by Fabrice Douar, and featured a series of paintings of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, done atop photographs that Bilal took of the Louvre&#x27;s collection.

<text>Interstate 77 (I-77) is a north–south Interstate Highway in the Eastern United States. It traverses diverse terrain, from the mountainous state of West Virginia to the rolling farmlands of North Carolina and Ohio. It largely supplants the old U.S. Route 21 (US 21) between Cleveland, Ohio, and Columbia, South Carolina, as an important north–south corridor through the middle Appalachian Mountains. The southern terminus of I-77 is in Cayce, South Carolina, in Lexington County at the junction with I-26. The northern terminus is in Cleveland at the junction with I-90. Other major cities that I-77 connects to include Columbia, South Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; Charleston, West Virginia; and Akron, Ohio. The East River Mountain Tunnel, connecting Virginia and West Virginia, is one of only two instances in the U.S. where a mountain road tunnel crosses a state line. The other is the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, connecting Tennessee and Kentucky. I-77 is a snowbird route to the Southern U.S. for those traveling from the Great Lakes region.

===South Carolina===
I-77 begins as an eight-lane highway at I-26 in the far southwestern part of the Columbia metropolitan area. In the Columbia area, I-77 offers access to Fort Jackson before meeting I-20 in the northeastern part of the city. This segment of I-77, combined with I-20 and I-26, form a beltway around Columbia, though it is not officially designated as such.

After leaving the northern Columbia suburb of Blythewood, I-77 narrows to four lanes until it widens to eight lanes at Rock Hill from exit 77 to the North Carolina state line at I-485.

The final section of the entire length of I-77 was completed in Columbia in 1995.

===North Carolina===
I-77 through North Carolina begins at the South Carolina state line at Pineville. It narrows to six lanes on the North Carolina side south of Charlotte and then widens to 8 and 10 lanes through downtown before entering the North Carolina Piedmont region. In Charlotte, it intersects I-85 as well as intersecting each of the loops of I-485 and I-277 (twice). North of Charlotte, it skirts Lake Norman where it narrows again to four lanes before passing through Huntersville, Cornelius, Davidson, and Mooresville. At Statesville, north of I-85, it intersects I-40 and US 70. Next, it crosses over US 421 in Yadkin County and continues on through Elkin. The final intersection in the state is with a discontinuous section of I-74 near Mount Airy.

I-77 in Charlotte is also known as the Bill Lee Freeway; this designation stretches from exit 6 (South Tryon Street/Woodlawn Road) in Charlotte to exit 33 (US 21 north), near Mooresville. A portion south of the city is called the General Younts Expressway. When I-77 crosses over I-85 (which runs in an east–west direction through the interchange), the northbound lanes are to the west of the southbound lanes.

North Carolina completed its section of I-77 in 1975.

===Virginia===
I-77 through Virginia passes through two tunnels: the Big Walker and East River mountain tunnels. For , I-77 and I-81 overlap near Wytheville. This is a wrong-way concurrency, where two roads run concurrent with each other but are designated in opposite directions. For its entire length in Virginia, I-77 is either parallel to or concurrent with US 52. It will have a concurrency with I-74 throughout the state. 

On March 31, 2013, there was a nearly 100-car pileup on I-77 near Fancy Gap; as a result of that crash, electronic variable speed limit signs are now in place along that stretch of I-77. The speed limit can be adjusted according to driving conditions at any given time.

===West Virginia===
I-77 enters West Virginia through the East River Mountain Tunnel. At milepost 9, I-77 becomes cosigned with the West Virginia Turnpike for the next , a toll road between Princeton and Charleston. It is concurrent with I-64 to Charleston at Beckley. The speed limit is for most of the length, with a limit for the section between Marmet and the toll plaza near Pax.

It enters Charleston via the Yeager Bridge before splitting off at a four-level junction with I-64. north of the city center, it junctions with I-79, before proceeding north to Ripley and Parkersburg.

North of Charleston, I-77 is known as the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway.

===Ohio===
Entering from West Virginia at Marietta, I-77 passes through rolling Appalachian terrain.

The interchange with I-70 at Cambridge is (or at least at one time was) thought to be the largest interchange in the world, covering over .

I-77 continues north through Canton and then Akron, where it connects with I-76. The interchange with I-80, the Ohio Turnpike, between Akron and Cleveland was completed in December 2001; previously, traffic had to exit at State Route 21 (SR 21) to access the turnpike. I-77 ends at I-90 in Cleveland.

I-77 is also known as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway in Ohio and the Willow Freeway in Greater Cleveland.

<text>Plön () is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Ostholstein and Segeberg, the city of Neumünster, the district of Rendsburg-Eckernförde, the city of Kiel and the Baltic Sea.

== History ==
The district was established in 1867. In 1932 it was enlarged with parts of the dissolved district of Bordesholm. During the 20th century some municipalities left the district due to incorporation into the city of Kiel.

== Geography ==
The inland part of this small district is covered with lakes. The &quot;Großer Plöner See&quot; (&quot;Great Plön Lake&quot;, 29 km2) and the &quot;Selenter See&quot; (&quot;Lake Selent&quot;, 22 km2) are the largest lakes in Schleswig-Holstein. The lakeland and the adjoining parts of the neighbouring district Ostholstein constitute the region called Holstein Switzerland since the countryside is very hilly. However, the highest hill (&quot;Bungsberg&quot;) is only 168 m high. North of the lakeland there is the &quot;Probstei&quot;, a region on the coast of the Baltic Sea.

<doc id="93084" wikidata="Q40802" url="?curid=93084" title="Crab">
<text>Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura (meaning &quot;short tail&quot; in Greek), which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax. They live in all the world&#x27;s oceans, in freshwater, and on land. They are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton. They generally have five pairs of legs, and they have pincer claws on the ends of the frontmost pair. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago.

==Description==

Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin. Behind their pair of chelae (claws) are six walking legs and then two swimming legs. The crab breathes through gills on its underside; gills must be at least moist to work.

Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to . Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances – such as king crabs and porcelain crabs – are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.

==Environment==
Crabs are found in all of the world&#x27;s oceans, as well as in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. About 850 species are freshwater crabs.

== Sexual differences ==
Crabs often show marked sexual dimorphism. Males often have larger claws, a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crabs of the genus &quot;Uca&quot; (Ocypodidae). In fiddler crabs, males have one greatly enlarged claw used for communication, particularly for attracting a mate. Another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon (abdomen); in most male crabs, this is narrow and triangular in form, while females have a broader, rounded abdomen. This is because female crabs brood fertilised eggs on their pleopods.

==Life cycle==
Crabs attract a mate through chemical (pheromones), visual, acoustic, or vibratory means. Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as fiddler crab males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have internal fertilisation and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their eggs. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female&#x27;s abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called &quot;berried&quot; since the eggs resemble round berries.

When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the water, where they are part of the plankton. The release is often timed with the tidal and light/dark diurnal cycle. The free-swimming tiny zoea larvae can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk.


Each species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile, living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.

Most species of terrestrial crabs must migrate down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable roadkill of migrating crabs.

Once crabs have become juveniles, they still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by hormones. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the carapace. The crab must then extract all of itself – including its legs, mouthparts, eyestalks, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract – from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an exuvia), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.

==Behaviour==

Crabs typically walk sideways (hence the term ), because of the articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient. Some crabs walk forward or backward, including raninids, &quot;Libinia emarginata&quot; and &quot;Mictyris platycheles&quot;. Some crabs, like the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming, the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.

Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive toward one another, and males often fight to gain access to females. On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes. Fiddler crabs (genus &quot;Uca&quot;) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and mating, and to defend against intruders.

Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae, and taking any other food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest growth and greatest fitness. Some species are more specialised in their diets, based in plankton, clams or fish.

Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her eggs.

==Human consumption==
===Fisheries===

Crabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5 million tonnes annually. One species, &quot;Portunus trituberculatus&quot;, accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important taxa include &quot;Portunus pelagicus&quot;, several species in the genus &quot;Chionoecetes&quot;, the blue crab (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;), &quot;Charybdis&quot; spp., &quot;Cancer pagurus&quot;, the Dungeness crab (&quot;Metacarcinus magister&quot;), and &quot;Scylla serrata&quot;, each of which yields more than 20,000 tonnes annually.

In some crab species, meat is harvested by manually twisting and pulling off one or both claws and returning the live crab to the water in the knowledge that the crab may survive and regenerate the claws.

===Crabs as food===
Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. Some species can be eaten whole, including the shell, as soft-shell crabs; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the snow crab. In many cultures, the roe of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in Southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and Northern European cultures, and on the East, Chesapeake, and Gulf Coasts of the United States.

In some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In Southeast Asia and the Indosphere, masala crab and chilli crab are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the Chesapeake Bay region, blue crab is often steamed with Old Bay Seasoning. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter.
For the British dish dressed crab, the crab meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise, or mustard, creating a crab cake. Crabs can also be made into a bisque, a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made.

Imitation crab, also called surimi, is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern. Indeed, surimi is an important source of protein in most East and Southeast Asian cultures, appearing in staple ingredients such as fish balls and fish cake.

===Pain===
Whether crustaceans as a whole experience pain or not is a scientific debate that has ethical implications for crab dish preparation. Crabs are very often boiled alive as part of the cooking process.
==Evolution==
The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Early Jurassic, with the oldest being &quot;Eocarcinus&quot; from the early Pliensbachian of Britain, which likely represents a stem-group lineage, as it lacks several key morphological features that define modern crabs. Most Jurassic crabs are only known from dorsal (top half of the body) carapaces, making it difficult to determine their relationships. Crabs radiated in the Late Jurassic, corresponding with an increase in reef habitats, though they would decline at the end of the Jurassic as the result of the decline of reef ecosystems. Crabs increased in diversity through the Cretaceous and represented the dominant group of decapods by the end of the period.

The crab infraorder Brachyura belongs to the group Reptantia, which consists of the walking/crawling decapods (lobsters and crabs). Brachyura is the sister clade to the infraorder Anomura, which contains the hermit crabs and relatives. The cladogram below shows Brachyura&#x27;s placement within the larger order Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe &quot;et al.&quot;, 2019.

Brachyura is separated into several sections, with the basal Dromiacea diverging the earliest in the evolutionary history, around the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. The group consisting of Raninoida and Cyclodorippoida split off next, during the Jurassic period. The remaining clade Eubrachyura then divided during the Cretaceous period into Heterotremata and Thoracotremata.
A summary of the high-level internal relationships within Brachyura can be shown in the cladogram below:


There is a no consensus on the relationships of the subsequent superfamilies and families. The proposed cladogram below is from analysis by Tsang &quot;et al&quot;, 2014:
==Classification==
The infraorder Brachyura contains approximately 7,000 species in 98 families, as many as the remainder of the Decapoda. The evolution of crabs is characterized by an increasingly robust body, and a reduction in the abdomen. Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, carcinisation is most advanced in crabs. The telson is no longer functional in crabs, and the uropods are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the sternum.

In most decapods, the gonopores (sexual openings) are found on the legs. Since crabs use their first two pairs of pleopods (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved toward the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum. A similar change occurred, independently, with the female gonopores. The movement of the female gonopore to the sternum defines the clade Eubrachyura, and the later change in the position of the male gonopore defines the Thoracotremata. It is still a subject of debate whether a monophyletic group is formed by those crabs where the female, but not male, gonopores are situated on the sternum.

===Families===
Numbers of extant and extinct (†) species are given in brackets. The superfamily Eocarcinoidea, containing &quot;Eocarcinus&quot; and &quot;Platykotta&quot;, was formerly thought to contain the oldest crabs; it is now considered part of the Anomura.

Recent studies have found the following superfamilies and families to not be monophyletic, but rather paraphyletic or polyphyletic:

* The Thoracotremata superfamily Grapsoidea is polyphyletic
* The Thoracotremata superfamily Ocypodoidea is polyphyletic
* The Heterotremata superfamily Calappoidea is polyphyletic
* The Heterotremata superfamily Eriphioidea is polyphyletic
* The Heterotremata superfamily Goneplacoidea is polyphyletic
* The Heterotremata superfamily Potamoidea is paraphyletic with respect to Gecarcinucoidea, which is resolved by placing Gecarcinucidae within Potamoidea
* The Majoidea families Epialtidae, Mithracidae and Majidae are polyphyletic with respect to each other
* The Dromioidea family Dromiidae may be paraphyletic with respect to Dynomenidae
* The Homoloidea family Homolidae is paraphyletic with respect to Latreilliidae
* The Xanthoidea family Xanthidae is paraphyletic with respect to Panopeidae

==Cultural influences==
Both the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab Pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea, and often depicted crabs in their art. In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, &quot;The Crab that Played with the Sea&quot;, tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides. The auction for the crab quota in 2019, Russia is the largest revenue auction in the world except the spectrum auctions. In Malay mythology (as related by Hugh Clifford to Walter William Skeat), ocean tides are believed to be caused by water rushing in and out of a hole in the Navel of the Seas (&quot;Pusat Tasek&quot;), where &quot;there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to search for food&quot;.

The Kapsiki people of North Cameroon use the way crabs handle objects for divination.

The term &quot;crab mentality&quot; is derived from a type of detrimental social behavior observed in crabs.
