== History ==


For thousands of years, indigenous peoples occupied this area of present-day Texas. The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Smith County were the Caddo Indians, who were recorded here until 1819. That year, a band of Cherokee, led by their chief, &quot;The Bowl&quot; (also known as Chief Bowles), migrated from Georgia and settled in what are now Smith and Rusk counties. The Treaty of Bowles Village on February 23, 1836, between the Republic of Texas and the Cherokee and 12 affiliated tribes, gave all of Smith and Cherokee counties, as well as parts of western Rusk County, southern Gregg (formed from Rusk County in 1873) and southeastern Van Zandt counties to the tribes.

Native Americans remained on these lands until the Cherokee War in the summer of 1839, as part of European-American conflicts with Native Americans in Texas. The Cherokee were driven out of Smith County. In this period, Cherokee and other Native American nations were forced from the Southeast United States to west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory during Indian Removal.

After 1845, some Cherokee returned when Benjamin Franklin Thompson, a white man married to a Cherokee, purchased 10,000 acres of land in Rusk County and allowed them to settle. The Mount Tabor Indian Community developed here, some six miles south of present-day Kilgore. The community later grew and incorporated areas near Overton, Arp, and Troup, Texas.

In July 1846, Smith County separated from the Nacogdoches District and was named for James Smith, a general of the Texas Revolution. At this time, Tyler was designated as the county seat.

During the American Civil War, Camp Ford was the largest Confederate prisoner-of-war camp west of the Mississippi River. Here, Sheriff Jim Reed of Collin County and Judge McReynolds, former chief justice of the district, were seized and lynched by &quot;Regulators&quot;.

The original site of the camp stockade is now a public historic park owned by Smith County, as such it is exempted from making any County property tax contribution, and is managed by the Smith County Historical Society. The park contains a kiosk, a paved trail, interpretive signage, a cabin reconstruction, and a picnic area. To date, it has never been the site of a paid venue, nor public event. It is located on Highway 271, 0.8 miles north of Loop 323.

===20th century to present===
Camp Fanin, a World War II US army replacement training facility, was located in the area known as Owentown, northeast of Tyler along US Hwy 271. Many of its original buildings still exist.

The Smith County Historical Society, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, was founded in 1959 by individuals and business firms dedicated to discovering, collecting, and preserving data, records, and other items relating to the history of Smith County. More information can be found at the Smith County Historical Society Website.

Among its population in 2010, the racial and ethnic makeup was 62.11% non-Hispanic white, 17.74% Black or African American, 0.35% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.22% Asian alone, 0.03% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.11% some other race, 3.47% multiracial, and 17.21% Hispanic or Latino of any race. In 2020, its racial and ethnic makeup was 57.59% non-Hispanic white, 16.28% Black or African American, 0.32% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.77% Asian alone, 0.03% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.30% some other race, 3.47% multiracial and 20.25% Hispanic or Latino of any race; 2020&#x27;s census statistics reflected state and nationwide demographic trends of greater diversification within the U.S. overall.

==Politics==
Smith County was one of the first areas of Texas to break off from a Solid South voting pattern. The last Democrat to carry Smith County was incumbent President Harry S. Truman in 1948. The county&#x27;s conservative white voters began splitting their tickets as early as the next election, when it swung from a 29-point win for Truman to a 17-point win for Dwight Eisenhower. In 1964, it rejected Democratic President and Texas native Lyndon B. Johnson in favor of Barry Goldwater, albeit by fewer than 500 votes. It was one of three East Texas counties, along with Panola and Gregg, to vote for Goldwater. At that time, most Blacks and Latinos in the county were still disenfranchised due to the state&#x27;s discriminatory use of certain barriers. Underscoring how rapidly it swung Republican, the Democrats have only managed 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote four times since Truman, the last being Jimmy Carter in 1976. No Democrat has managed even 30 percent of the county&#x27;s vote in the past seven elections, though Barack Obama and Joe Biden came close in 2008 and 2020, respectively.











Smith County is represented in the Texas House of Representatives by Matt Schaefer (R) of Tyler and the Texas Senate by Senator Bryan Hughes (R). Its U.S. Representative is Nathaniel Moran (R).

==Government and infrastructure==
The county is governed by a Commissioners Court, made up of four members elected from single-member districts and a county judge elected at-large.

Smith County ranks 10th in the State of Texas for road miles. The county has 1,170 miles – about the distance from Tyler, Texas to Paradise, Nevada – of roads it maintains. The Smith County Road &amp; Bridge Department maintains the county&#x27;s bridges and roads, including mowing the rights of way.

The $39.5 million Smith County Road Bond passed with 73% of the vote on November 7, 2017. The issuance of bonds was for road and bridge construction and major improvements. Road work around the county is well underway. For a list of road projects in the two-phase, six-year bond program, visit www.smith-county.com.

<text>John Broadus Watson (January 9, 1878 – September 25, 1958) was an American psychologist who popularized the scientific theory of behaviorism, establishing it as a psychological school. Watson advanced this change in the psychological discipline through his 1913 address at Columbia University, titled &quot;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&quot;. Through his behaviorist approach, Watson conducted research on animal behavior, child rearing, and advertising, as well as conducting the controversial &quot;Little Albert&quot; experiment and the Kerplunk experiment. He was also the editor of &quot;Psychological Review&quot; from 1910 to 1915. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Watson as the 17th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
He was born on January 9, 1878. His father, Pickens Butler Watson, was an alcoholic and left the family to live with two Indian women when John was 13 years old—a transgression which he never forgave. His mother, Emma Kesiah Watson (née Roe), was a very religious woman who adhered to prohibitions against drinking, smoking, and dancing, naming her son John after a prominent Baptist minister in hopes that it would help him receive the call to preach the Gospel. In bringing him up, she subjected Watson to harsh religious training that later led him to develop a lifelong antipathy toward all forms of religion and to become an atheist.

In an attempt to escape poverty, Watson&#x27;s mother sold their farm and brought Watson to Greenville, South Carolina, to provide him a better opportunity for success. Moving from an isolated, rural location to the large urbanity of Greenville proved to be important for Watson, providing him the opportunity to experience a variety of different types of people, which he used to cultivate his theories on psychology. However, the initial transition would be a struggle for Watson, due to his limited social skills.

=== Marriage and children ===
Watson married Mary Ickes, sister of politician Harold L. Ickes, while he was in graduate school. They had two children, also named John and Mary Ickes Watson, the latter of whom attempted suicide later in life. Young Mary and her husband, Paul Hartley, had a daughter, Mariette Hartley, an actor who suffered from psychological issues that she attributed to her being raised according to her grandfather&#x27;s theories.

Watson&#x27;s wife later sought divorce due to his ongoing affair with a student, Rosalie Rayner (1898–1935). In searching Rayner&#x27;s bedroom, Mary discovered love letters from Watson. The affair became front-page news in Baltimore. The publicity resulted in Johns Hopkins University asking Watson to resign his faculty position in October 1920.

In 1921, following the finalization of the divorce, Watson and Rayner married in New Jersey, parenting two sons, William Rayner Watson (1921) and James Broadus Watson (1924), who were raised with the behaviorist principles that John espoused throughout his career. The couple remained together until Rayner&#x27;s death at age 36 in 1935. Like their half-sister, both sons later attempted suicide, with William killing himself in 1954.

=== Later life and death ===
Watson burned his letters and personal papers, thus depriving historians of a resource for understanding the early history of behaviorism and of Watson himself.

Historian John Burnham interviewed Watson late in life, presenting him as a man of strong opinions and some bitterness towards his detractors. In 1957, shortly before his death, Watson received a Gold Medal from the American Psychological Association for his contributions to psychology.

Watson lived on his farm until his death in 1958 at age 80. He was buried at Willowbrook Cemetery, Westport, Connecticut.

== Education ==
Despite his poor academic performance and having been arrested twice during high school—first for fighting, then for discharging firearms within city limits—Watson was able to use his mother&#x27;s connections to gain admission to Greenville&#x27;s Furman University at the age of 16. There, he would complete a few psychology courses, though never excelling. He would also consider himself to be a poor student, holding a few jobs on campus to pay for his college expenses. Others thought him as quiet, lazy, and insubordinate, and, as such, he continued to see himself as &quot;unsocial,&quot; making few friends. Nevertheless, being a precocious student, Watson would leave Furman with a master&#x27;s degree at the age of 21.

After graduating, Watson spent a year at Batesburg Institute, the name he gave to a one-room school in Greenville, at which he was principal, janitor, and handyman. Watson entered the University of Chicago after petitioning the University President. The successful petition would be central to his ascent into the psychology world, as his college experience introduced him to professors and colleagues who would be integral to his success in developing psychology into a credible field of study. Watson began studying philosophy under John Dewey on the recommendation of Furman professor, Gordon Moore. The combined influence of Dewey, James Rowland Angell, Henry Herbert Donaldson, and Jacques Loeb, led Watson to develop a highly descriptive, objective approach to the analysis of behavior, an approach he would later call &quot;behaviorism&quot;. Wanting to make psychology more scientifically acceptable, Watson thought of the approach as a declaration of faith, based on the idea that a methodology could transform psychology into a scientific discipline. Later, Watson became interested in the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936), and eventually included a highly simplified version of Pavlov&#x27;s principles in his popular works.

=== Dissertation on animal behavior ===
Watson earned his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1903. In his dissertation, &quot;Animal Education&quot;, he described the relationship between brain myelination and learning ability in rats at different ages. Watson showed that the degree of myelinization was largely related to learning ability. Watson stayed at the University of Chicago for five years doing research on the relationship between sensory input and learning. He discovered that the kinesthetic sense controlled the behavior of rats running in mazes. In 1908, Watson was offered and accepted a faculty position at Johns Hopkins University and was immediately promoted to chair of the psychology department.

== Behaviorism ==
In 1913, Watson published the article &quot;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&quot; (also called &quot;The Behaviorist Manifesto&quot;). In the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, Watson outlines the major features of his new philosophy of psychology, &quot;behaviorism&quot;, with the first paragraph of the article concisely describing Watson&#x27;s behaviorist position:Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist&#x27;s total scheme of investigation.In 1913, Watson viewed Pavlov&#x27;s conditioned reflex as primarily a physiological mechanism controlling glandular secretions. He had already rejected Edward L. Thorndike&#x27;s &#x27;law of effect&#x27; (a precursor to B. F. Skinner&#x27;s principle of reinforcement) due to what Watson believed were unnecessary subjective elements. It was not until 1916 that he would recognize the more general significance of Pavlov&#x27;s formulation, after which Watson would make such the subject of his presidential address to the American Psychological Association. The article is also notable for its strong defense of the objective scientific status of applied psychology, which at the time was considered to be much inferior to the established structuralist experimental psychology.

With his notion of &quot;behaviorism&quot;, Watson put the emphasis on external behavior of people and their reactions on given situations, rather than the internal, mental state of those people. In his opinion, the analysis of behaviors and reactions was the only objective method to get insight in the human actions. This outlook—combined with the complementary ideas of determinism, evolutionary continuism, and empiricism—has contributed to what is sometimes called Methodological Behaviorism (not to be confused with the Radical Behaviorism of Skinner). It was this new perspective that Watson claimed would lead psychology into a new era. He claimed that prior to Wilhelm Wundt, there was no psychology, and that after Wundt there was only confusion and anarchy. It was Watson&#x27;s new behaviorism that would pave the way for further advancements in psychology.

Watson&#x27;s behaviorism rejected the studying of consciousness. He was convinced that it could not be studied, and that past attempts to do so have only been hindering the advancement of psychological theories. He felt that introspection was faulty at best and awarded researchers nothing but more issues. He pushed for psychology to no longer be considered the science of the &#x27;mind&#x27;. Instead, he stated that psychology should focus on the &#x27;behavior&#x27; of the individual, not their consciousness.

Meanwhile, Watson served as the president of the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology in 1915.

===Language, speech, and memory===

Watson argued that mental activity could not be observed. In his book, &quot;Behaviorism&quot; (1924), Watson discussed his thoughts on what language really is, which leads to a discussion of what words really are, and finally to an explanation of what memory is. They are all manual devices used by humans that result in &quot;thinking&quot;. By using anecdotes that illustrate the behaviors and activities of mammals, Watson outlined his behaviorist views on these topics.

Watson refers to &quot;language&quot; as a &quot;manipulative habit,&quot; because when we speak language, the sound originates in our larynx, which is a body instrument that we manipulate every time we talk in order to hear our &quot;voice.&quot; As we change our throat shape and tongue position, different sounds are made. Watson explains that when a baby first cries, or first says &quot;da&quot; or &quot;ma,&quot; that it is learning language. To further his theory, Watson and his wife conducted an experiment in which they conditioned a baby to say &quot;da-da&quot; when he wanted his bottle. Although the baby was conditioned and was a success for a short while, the conditioning was eventually lost. Watson argues, however, that as the child got older, he would imitate Watson as a result of Watson imitating him. By three years old, the child needed no help developing his vocabulary because he was learning from others. Thus, language is imitative.

Watson goes on to claim that, &quot;words are but substitutes for objects and situations.&quot; In his earlier baby experiment, the baby learned to say &quot;da&quot; when he wanted a bottle, or &quot;mama&quot; when he wanted his mom, or &quot;shoe-da&quot; when he pointed to his father&#x27;s shoe. Watson then argues that &quot;we watch our chances and build upon these,&quot; meaning human babies have to form their language by applying sounds they have already formed. This, Watson says, is why babies point to an object but call it a different word. Lastly, Watson explains how a child learns to read words: a mom points at each word and reads in a patterned manner, and eventually, because the child recognizes the word with the sound, he or she learns to read it back.

This, according to Watson, is the start of memory. All of the ideas previously mentioned are what Watson says make up our memory, and that we carry the memory we develop throughout our lives. Watson tells the tale of Mr. Addison Sims and his friend in order to illustrate these ideas. A friend of Mr. Sims&#x27; sees Mr. Sims on a street sidewalk and exclaims: &quot;Upon my life! Addison Sims of Seattle! I haven&#x27;t seen you since the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago. Do you remember the gay parties we used to have in the old Windermere Hotel?&quot; Even after all of this, Mr. Sims cannot remember the man&#x27;s name, although they were old friends who used to encounter many of the same people, places, and experiences together. Watson argued that if the two men were to do some of their old shared activities and go to some of the old same places (the stimuli), then the response (or memory) would occur.

=== Study of emotions ===
Watson was interested in the conditioning of emotions. Of course behaviorism putting an emphasis on people&#x27;s external behaviors, emotions were considered as mere physical responses. Watson thought that, at birth, there are three unlearned emotional reactions:

* Fear: evoked by only two stimuli that are unconditioned—a sudden noise or the loss of (physical) support. However, because older children are afraid of many things (e.g. different animals, strange people etc.), it must be that such fear-provoking stimuli are learned. Fear can be observed by the following reaction with infants: crying, rapid breathing, eyes closing, or sudden jumping.
* Rage: an innate response to the body movement of the child being constrained. If a very young child is held in a way that she cannot move at all, then she will begin to scream and stiffen her body. Later this reaction is applied to different situations, e.g. children get angry when they are forced to take a bath or clean their room. These situations provoke rage because they are associated with physical restraint.
* Love: an automatic response from infants when tickled, patted, or stroked lightly. The infant responds with smiles, laughs, and other affectionate responses. According to Watson, infants do not love specific people, they are only conditioned to do so. Because the mother&#x27;s face is progressively associated with the patting and stroking, it becomes the conditioned stimulus eliciting the affection towards her. Affectionate feelings, for people later, generate the same response because they are somehow associated with the mother.

== Use of children ==
=== &quot;Little Albert&quot; experiment (1920) ===
One might consider the experiment Watson and his assistant Rosalie Rayner carried out in 1920 to be one of the most controversial in psychology. It has become immortalized in introductory psychology textbooks as the Little Albert experiment. The goal of the experiment was to show how principles of, at the time recently discovered, classical conditioning could be applied to condition fear of a white rat into &quot;Little Albert&quot;, a 9-month-old boy. Watson and Rayner conditioned &quot;Little Albert&quot; by clanging an iron rod when a white rat was presented. First, they presented to the boy a white rat and observed that he was not afraid of it. Second, they presented him with a white rat and then clanged an iron rod. &quot;Little Albert&quot; responded by crying. This second presentation was repeated several times. Finally, Watson and Rayner presented the white rat by itself and the boy showed fear. Later, in an attempt to see if the fear transferred to other objects, Watson presented Albert with a rabbit, a dog, and a fur coat. He cried at the sight of all of them. This study demonstrated how emotions could become conditioned responses. As the story of &quot;Little Albert&quot; has made the rounds, inaccuracies and inconsistencies have crept in, some of them even due to Watson himself. Analyses of Watson&#x27;s film footage of Albert suggest that the infant was mentally and developmentally disabled. An ethical problem of this study is that Watson and Rayner did not uncondition &quot;Little Albert&quot;.

In 2009, Beck and Levinson found records of a child, Douglas Merritte, who seemed to have been Little Albert. They found that he had died from congenital hydrocephalus at the age of 6. Thus, it cannot be concluded to what extent this study had an effect on Little Albert&#x27;s life. On January 25, 2012, Tom Bartlett of &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; published a report that questions whether John Watson knew of cognitive abnormalities in Little Albert that would greatly skew the results of the experiment. In 2014, however, the journals that initially endorsed Beck and Fridlund&#x27;s claims about Albert and Watson (the &quot;American Psychologist&quot; and &quot;History of Psychology&quot;) published articles debunking those claims.

==== Deconditioning ====
Because &quot;Little Albert&quot; was taken out of town, Watson did not have the time to decondition the child. This obviously has ethical implications, but Watson did put in place a method for deconditioning fears. He worked with a colleague, Mary Cover Jones, on a set of procedures aimed at eliminating the fears of another little boy, Peter. Peter seemed to fear white rats and rabbits. Watson and Jones put Peter in his highchair and gave him a nice afternoon snack. At the same time a white rabbit in a cage was put in a distance that did not seem to disturb the child. The next day the rabbit was put slightly closer until Peter showed signs of slight disturbance. This treatment was repeated days after days until Peter could serenely eat his snack with the rabbit being right next to him. Peter was even able to play with the rabbit afterwards. This form of behavior modification is a technique today called systematic desensitization.

==== Limitations of the conditioning paradigm ====
The conditioning paradigm has certain limitations. Researchers have had a hard time conditioning infants that are just a few months old. This might be because they have not yet developed what Piaget calls &quot;primary circular reactions&quot;. Because they cannot coordinate sensory motor actions they cannot learn to make different associations between their motoric behaviors and the environment. Another limitation concerns the kind of conditioned stimuli humans can learn. When researchers attempt to condition children to fear things such as curtains or wooden blocks they have had great difficulty. Humans may be &quot;innately disposed to fear certain stimuli.&quot;

=== &quot;Psychological Care of Infant and Child&quot; (1928) ===
The 20th century marked the formation of qualitative distinctions between children and adults. In 1928, Watson wrote the book &quot;Psychological Care of Infant and Child&quot; with help from Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and wife. In it, Watson explains that behaviorists were starting to believe psychological care and analysis were required for infants and children. All of Watson&#x27;s exclamations were due to his belief that children should be treated as a young adult. As such, he warns against the inevitable dangers of a mother providing too much love and affection, because love—along with everything else understood by the behaviorist perspective—Watson argues, is conditioned. He uses invalidism to support his warning, contending that, since society does not overly comfort children as they become young adults in the real world, parents should not set up these unrealistic expectations. Moreover, he disapproves of thumb sucking, masturbation, homosexuality, and encourages parents to be honest with their children about sex. He would reason such views by saying that &quot;all of the weaknesses, reserves, fears, cautions, and inferiorities of our parents are stamped into us with sledge hammer blows,&quot; inferring that emotional disabilities were the result of personal treatment, not inheritance.

Watson deemed his slogan to be &quot;&quot;not more babies but better brought up babies&quot;,&quot; in support of the &#x27;nurture&#x27; side of the &#x27;nature vs nurture&#x27; debate, claiming that the world would benefit from extinguishing pregnancies for 20 years while enough data was gathered to ensure an efficient child-rearing process. Further emphasizing nurture, Watson argued that nothing is instinctual, but rather everything is built into a child through the interaction with their environment. Parents, therefore, hold complete responsibility as they choose what environment to allow their child to develop in.

Though having researched many topics throughout career, child-rearing became Watson&#x27;s most prized interest. His book would be extremely popular, having sold 100,000 copies after just a few months of release. Many critics were surprised to see even his contemporaries come to accept his views. His emphasis on child development started to become a new phenomenon and would influence some of his successors, though the field had already been delved into by psychologists prior to Watson. G. Stanley Hall, for instance, became very well known for his 1904 book &quot;Adolescence&quot;. Hall&#x27;s beliefs differed from Watson&#x27;s behaviorism, as the former believed that one&#x27;s behavior is mostly shaped by heredity and genetically predetermined factors, especially during childhood. His most famous concept, the &quot;storm and stress theory&quot;, normalized adolescents&#x27; tendency to act out with conflicting mood swings.

Although he wrote extensively on child-rearing, including in &quot;Psychological Care of Infant and Child&quot;, as well as in many popular magazines, Watson later regretted having written in the area altogether, conceding that he &quot;did not know enough&quot; to do a good job.

==== Criticism ====
Critics determined that Watson&#x27;s ideas mainly stemmed from his beliefs. How much Rosalie Rayner agreed with her husband&#x27;s child-rearing ideas has also been an important question, as she later penned an article entitled &quot;I am a Mother of Behaviorist Sons&quot;, in which she wrote about the future of their family.

R. Dale Nance (1970) worried that Watson&#x27;s personal indiscretions and difficult upbringings could have affected his views while writing his book. This would include having been raised on a poor farm in South Carolina and having various family troubles, such as abandonment by his father. Suzanne Houk (2000) shared similar concerns while analyzing Watson&#x27;s hope for a businesslike and casual relationship between a mother and her child. Houk points out that Watson only shifted his focus to child-rearing when he was fired from Johns Hopkins University due to his affair with Rayner. Laura E. Berk (2008) similarly examines the roots of the beliefs that Watson came to honor, noting the Little Albert experiment as the inspiration of Watson&#x27;s emphasis on environmental factors. Little Albert did not fear the rat and white rabbit until he was conditioned to do so. From this experiment, Watson concluded that parents can shape a child&#x27;s behavior and development simply by a scheming control of all stimulus-response associations.

Watson&#x27;s advice to treat children with respect but relative emotional detachment, has been strongly criticized. J. M. O&#x27;Donnell (1985) deems Watson&#x27;s views as radical calculations. This discontent stems partly from Watsons&#x27; description of a &#x27;happy child&#x27;, whereby a child can only cry when in physical pain, can occupy himself through his problem-solving abilities, and whereby the child strays from asking questions. Other critics were more wary of Watson&#x27;s new interest and success in child psychology.

=== &quot;Twelve infants&quot; ===
Watson has been misquoted in regards to the following passage, which is often presented out of context and with the last sentence omitted, making his position appear more radical than it actually was: 

In Watson&#x27;s &quot;Behaviorism&quot;, the sentence is provided in the context of an extended argument against eugenics. That Watson did not hold a radical environmentalist position may be seen in his earlier writing in which his &quot;starting point&quot; for a science of behavior was &quot;the observable fact that organisms, man and animal alike, do adjust themselves to their environment by means of hereditary and habit equipments.&quot; Nevertheless, Watson recognized the importance of nurture in the nature versus nurture discussion which was often neglected by his eugenic contemporaries.

== Advertising career ==
Thanks to contacts provided by E. B. Titchener, an academic colleague, Watson subsequently began working late in 1920 for U.S. advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. He learned the advertising business&#x27; many facets at ground level, including a stint working as a shoe salesman in an upscale department store. Despite this modest start, in less than two years Watson had risen to a vice-presidency at Thompson. His executive&#x27;s salary, plus bonuses from various successful ad campaigns, resulted in an income many times higher than his academic salary. Watson headed a number of high-profile advertising campaigns, particularly for Ponds cold cream and other personal-care products. In addition, he is credited with popularizing the &quot;coffee break&quot; during an ad campaign for Maxwell House coffee. He has been widely but erroneously credited with re-introducing the &quot;testimonial&quot; advertisement after the tool had fallen out of favor (due to its association with ineffective and dangerous patent medicines). However, testimonial advertisements had been in use for years before Watson entered advertising.

An example of Watson&#x27;s use of testimonials was with the campaign he developed for Pebeco Toothpaste. The ad featured a seductively dressed woman, and coaxed women to smoke, as long as they used Pebeco toothpaste. The toothpaste was not a means to benefit health or hygiene, but as a way to heighten the sexual attraction of the consumer. Watson stated that he was not making original contributions, but was just doing what was normal practice in advertising. Watson stopped writing for popular audiences in 1936, and retired from advertising at about age 65.

<text>Scurry County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 16,932. Its county seat is Snyder, which is the home for Western Texas College. Scurry County is named for Confederate General William Scurry. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1884. Scurry County was one of 46 prohibition, or entirely dry, counties in the state of Texas, until a 2006 election approved the sale of beer and wine in Snyder, and a 2008 election approved the sale of liquor by the drink throughout the county.

Scurry County comprises the Snyder, Texas, micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
This county, lying directly north of Mitchell County, was created in 1876, and was organized June 28, 1884. It was named for William Read Scurry, lawyer and Confederate Army general. Until 1909, it was without railroad facilities, and the nearest shipping points were Colorado City to the south and still later the railroad towns in Fisher County to the east.

The first railroad was the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway, built from Roscoe on the Texas &amp; Pacific in Nolan County, to Snyder, the county seat of Scurry County, about 1909, and subsequently extended to Fluvanna, also in Scurry County. In 1911, the Texico-Coleman division of the Santa Fe system was built through the county, giving it a trunk line of railway. Development has been particularly rapid during the early 1900s.

Some of the important pioneer facts concerning Scurry County are found in a sketch of W.H. Snyder, after whom the county seat town was named. In 1877, he opened a trading camp in the county, hauling lumber on wagons from Dallas to build his store and also hauling a good portion of his goods from the same place. He used what was known as trail wagons, with seven yoke of oxen to a team, each wagon having a capacity of 50,000 pounds. Mr. Snyder erected a house in Scurry County and began dealing in general merchandise and supplies for buffalo hunters. Other parties moved into the same locality, and that was the beginning of the town of Snyder.

In 1882, Mr. Snyder laid out the town, and two years later, it became the county seat. Snyder has had an enterprising citizenship, and 10 years later had an independent school district and four churches, and was an important center for trade.

Its importance has greatly increased since the coming of the railway, and in 1910, its population was 2,154. Other towns have sprung up along the railway, the most important of which is Fluvanna, at the terminus of the Roscoe, Snyder &amp; Pacific, and Hermleigh.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.2%) are covered by water.

Since 1952, Lake J. B. Thomas has operated in Scurry County covering up to 7,282 acres when filled to the morning glory spillway at elevation of 2,258 ft above sea level.

<text>Schleicher County is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 2,451. Its county seat is Eldorado. The county was created in 1887 and organized in 1901. It is named for Gustav Schleicher, a German immigrant who became a surveyor and politician.

==History==
Around 8000 BC, the first inhabitants in the area were probably Jumano Indians. Later inhabitants were Lipan Apaches and Comanches. In 1632, Fray Juan de Salas and Father Juan de Ortega did missionary work among the Jumanos. Soldier Francisco Amangual led an expedition across the area in 1808. In 1882, Christopher Columbus Doty became the first permanent citizen of Schleicher County.

The Texas Legislature established Schleicher County in April 1887 from Crockett County, and named it in honor of Gustav Schleicher. By 1890, the population was 155, of whom 134 were listed as White, four were Black, and 17 were American Indian.

In 1894, the county&#x27;s first public school opened at Verand, and later moved to Eldorado. The next year, W. B. Silliman founded the Eldorado community and named it after the mythical city. To populate it, he offered free town lots to residents of nearby Verand.
In 1930, the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company resumed work on a previous railroad, making access possible to San Angelo and Sonora. On February 27, 1941, the West Texas Woolen Mills plant in Eldorado held a grand opening, with a parade and BBQ lunch. About 5,000 people attended. Governor &quot;Pappy&quot; W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel was the guest speaker.

Oilfield discoveries on school lands in the 1950s enabled Schleicher County to build new library and gymnasium facilities for its students.

<text>San Saba County is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in western Central Texas, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,730. Its county seat is San Saba. The county is named after the San Saba River, which flows through the county.

==History==

===Early history===
Early Native American inhabitants of the area included Tonkawa, Caddo, Lipan Apache, and Comanche. In 1732, Governor of Spanish Texas, Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos, arrived on the feast day of sixth-century monk St. Sabbas, and named the river &quot;Río de San Sabá de las Nueces&quot;. Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission was established in 1757. In 1788, José Mares led an expedition from San Antonio to Santa Fe.

In 1828, 28 people from Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s group passed through. A portion of the county was included in Austin&#x27;s grants from the Mexican government. The Fisher–Miller Land Grant in 1842 contained most of later land deeds. Five years later, the Meusebach–Comanche Treaty was signed in San Saba County. In 1854, the Harkey family settled at Wallace and Richland Creeks. The David Matsler family moved from Burnet County to Cherokee Creek.

San Saba County was organized from Bexar County and named for the San Saba River in 1856. San Saba was selected as the county seat. The Seventh Texas Legislature confirmed the boundaries of the county in 1858. in 1860, the population was 913, which included 98 slaves. The county was divided into 10 school districts in 1867.

In 1874, Edmund E. Risen devoted his work to improving local nuts, in particular the pecan. San Saba eventually billed itself as the Pecan Capital of the World.

===Post-Civil War history===
In the 1880s-&#x27;90s, mob rule not only whipped and forced out numerous people in towns throughout Texas, but also took 140 lives in Texas following the Civil War. San Saba County had the worst of the violence, with 25 lives taken by lynching from 1880 to 1896. Mob killings in Texas in the years after the war were often racially motivated crimes committed by members of the Ku Klux Klan against suspected slave rebels and white abolitionists. An investigation led to the Texas Rangers restoring order. Many of the mob executions committed throughout Texas in the time following the Civil War were racially motivated and often committed by members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which formed in Shelby County, Texas. Most of the people killed by vigilante mobs in the five years after the war were &quot;suspected slave rebels and white abolitionists&quot;. Although the KKK in Texas was less active by the 1870s, lives continued to be taken each year. In 1885, for the state of Texas, &quot;...an estimated 22 mobs lynched 43 people, including 19 blacks and 24 whites, one of whom was female&quot;. &quot;The San Saba County lynchers, the deadliest of the lot, claimed some 25 victims between 1880 and 1896. Vigilante lynching died out in the 1890s, but other varieties of mobs continued.&quot;

The San Saba Male and Female Academy was founded in 1882. In 1889, the United Confederate Veterans William P. Rogers Camp No. 322 was established, named for Col. William P. Rogers. West Texas Normal and Business College was organized by Francis Marion Behrns in 1885.

===Late 19th and 20th centuries===
The parallel-wire suspension Beveridge Bridge was built across the San Saba River in 1896 by Flinn, Moyer Bridge Co. In 1911, the Lometa-Eden branch of the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway was built through San Saba County. San Saba County brick and sandstone courthouse is erected. Architect Chamberlin &amp; Co.
In 1930, half of the county farms were tenant farmed. In 1931, pioneer rancher W.H. &quot;Uncle Billy&quot; Gibbons gave the Boy Scouts of America a 99-year lease to campgrounds along Brady Creek on the historic Gibbons Ranch. Relocated several miles upstream in 1946, the Boy Scouts continue to use Camp Billy Gibbons to this day. The 1938 San Saba River floods caused county-wide devastation. One-third of the town of San Saba was under water. The Town of San Saba was incorporated in 1940. Prolonged drought in the mid-1950s brought hardship to the county agricultural economy.

The &quot;San Saba County News&quot; merged with the &quot;San Saba Star&quot; in 1960. In 1965, a historical marker was erected to honor pioneer doctor Edward D. Doss.

<text>San Patricio County is located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 68,755. Its county seat is Sinton. San Patricio County is part of the Corpus Christi metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

In 1828, 200 Irish Catholic families, recruited from Ireland and the Irish population of New York City, contracted with the Mexican government to settle on 80 leagues of land in this area. By 1836, about 500 people lived in the colony on 84 Mexican land grants. During the Texas Revolution, most fled from the colony because of fighting in the area. By 1841, a small number of permanent residents had returned. When Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, the area was stabilized by the presence of U.S. troops under General Zachary Taylor. In 1845, the county was formed (San Patricio is Spanish for Saint Patrick, the primary patron saint of the colonists&#x27; home country of Ireland), and Corpus Christi was designated as the county seat. The following year, the county south of the Nueces River was reorganized as Nueces County, and the town of San Patricio became the county seat of San Patricio County. In 1848, additional counties were formed out of San Patricio, which further reduced its size.

The 1850 U.S. Census listed only 200 people in the county, including three slaves. The local economy was based on cattle raising. In the mid-1860s, more settlers moved, drawn by the cheap land. By 1870, 602 people lived in the county, and the agricultural census reported 51 farms and ranches, totaling , in the area, with about described as &quot;improved&quot;. Development of the county intensified during the early 20th century, as hundreds of farmers moved in from North Texas and other states. The population reached 7,307 by 1910, and was 11,386 by 1920; 470 farms were counted in 1910, and 757 farms in 1920. Cattle ranching remained important, but vegetables and cotton also became important. The acres planted in the cotton increased from about in 1910 to by 1930.

== Government and politics ==

=== Government ===
San Patricio County, like all counties in Texas, is governed by a commissioners&#x27; court. This court consists of the county judge (the chairperson of the court), who is elected county-wide, and four commissioners who are elected by the voters in each of four precincts.

The Commissioners&#x27; Court is the policy-making body for the county; in addition, the county judge is the senior executive and administrative position in the county. The Commissioners&#x27; Court sets the county tax rate, adopts the budget, appoints boards and commissions, approves grants and personnel actions, and oversees the administration of county government. Each commissioner also supervises a Road and Bridge District.

===Politics===
Despite being majority-minority San Patricio county leans overwhelmingly Republican. The GOP does better than average among Latino residents in Texas, particularly south Texas. In 2022, Republicans won 40% of the Latino vote. This has been as high as 48% in 2014. These margins help Republicans win majority-minority districts, while Republicans in other parts of the country struggle - only garnering between 21% and 30% of the vote. Republicans appear to be increasing their Latino support from picking off specific segments: Men, rural Latinos, Rio Grande Valley, devout Catholics, Tejano and pro-life voters.

==History==
Like other eastern Texas counties, Sabine was originally developed as cotton plantations, which depended on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and emancipation, many freedmen remained in the rural area, working as tenant farmers and sharecroppers. There was considerable violence by whites against blacks during and after Reconstruction. After 1877 and through the early 20th century, Sabine County had 10 lynchings of blacks by whites in acts of racial terrorism. This was the fourth-highest total in the state, where lynchings took place in nearly all counties through this period.

From 1930 to 1970, the population declined as many African Americans left this rural county and other parts of the South in the Great Migration to escape Jim Crow oppression and seek better jobs, especially in Northern industrial cities and on the West Coast, where the defense industry built up during World War II.

<text>Rusk County is a county located in Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 52,214. Its county seat is Henderson. The county is named for Thomas Jefferson Rusk, a secretary of war of the Republic of Texas.

Rusk County is part of the Longview, Texas metropolitan area and the Longview-Marshall combined statistical area.

==History==
Prior to Texas&#x27; annexation in 1845, the land while from time to time occupied by Caddoan peoples, was generally unpopulated until 1819, when Cherokee Indians, led by The Bowl settled in what is now Rusk County. The Treaty of Bowles Village on February 23, 1836, between the Republic of Texas and the Cherokee and 12 affiliated tribes, gave parts of western Rusk County along with parts of today&#x27;s Gregg and Van Zandt Counties, in addition to the whole areas of Cherokee and Smith Counties to the tribes. They remained on these lands until the Cherokee War in the summer of 1839. Thus the Cherokee were driven out of Rusk County only to return in 1844 and 1845 with the purchase of 10,000 acres of land by Benjamin Franklin Thompson a white man married to a Cherokee. This established the Mount Tabor Indian Community, some six miles south of present-day Kilgore that later spread to incorporate areas near Troup, Arp and Overton, Texas. Originally organized as a part of Nacogdoches County, Rusk was established as its own county by the Congress of the Republic of Texas on January 16, 1843. By 1850, it was the second-most populous county in Texas of the 78 counties that had been organized at that time, according to the 1850 census. Rusk County&#x27;s population was 8,148 then; it was surpassed only by Harrison County with 11,822 people.

With the discovery of oil in Joinerville, within the county, in October 1930, an oil boom began that caused county population to nearly double during the next decade, and caused dramatic changes in the county towns. Rusk is one of the five counties that are part of the East Texas Oil Field, whose production has been a major part of the economy since that time.

Rusk County was one of 25 entirely dry counties in Texas until January 2012. The city of Henderson at that time opted to allow selling and serving beer and wine.

America&#x27;s worst school disaster happened in Rusk County in 1937, when nearly 300 people, most of them children, were killed in a natural gas explosion at the London Independent School District (which has since consolidated into West Rusk County Consolidated Independent School District).

<text>Rockwall County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. At 149 square miles (390 sq km), Rockwall County has the smallest area of any Texas county. Per the 2020 Census, its population was 107,819. Its county seat is Rockwall. The county and city are named for a wall-like subterranean rock formation that runs throughout the county. Rockwall County is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan statistical area. It was one of the top-25 fastest-growing counties in the U.S. in 2010. Rockwall County is listed as the wealthiest county in Texas and the 17th-wealthiest in the United States by median household income. Cities in Rockwall County include Rockwall, Heath, Royse City, Fate, McClendon-Chisholm, Mobile City, and part of Rowlett.

==History==
Rockwall County was formed in 1873 from portions of Kaufman County. It split off because access to the county seat of Kaufman was inconvenient. It was named for its county seat, Rockwall.
Rockwall County also is home to the great rock wall, which is no longer in public view today.

===American Community Survey 2023 Data===

The United States Census Bureau estimated that in 2023, Rockwall County’s population was 131,307, and the county was 21.4% Hispanic or Latino, with non-Hispanics consisting of 62.1% White, 9.9% Black, 3.8% Asian, 0.5% Native American, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 2.1% multiracial.

* Rockwall Independent School District (small portion in Kaufman County)
* Royse City Independent School District (small portion in Collin and Hunt Counties)

From 1997 to 2015, the number of non-Hispanic white children in K-12 schools in the county increased by 6,000 as part of a trend of white flight and suburbanization by non-Hispanic white families. It could not possibly have been caused by the cost of real estate in the area.

Collin College&#x27;s official service area includes all of Rockwall County.

==Politics==
Prior to 1972, Rockwall County was a Democratic stronghold. The 1968 election was highly transitional for the county, with Hubert Humphrey only winning with 39% of the vote due to the strong third-party candidacy of George Wallace. From 1972 on, the county has become a Republican stronghold. George H. W. Bush in 1992 has been the only Republican to fail to win a majority in the county since then, as the strong third-party candidacy of Ross Perot that year led him to a second-place finish in the county over national winner Bill Clinton. However, the county was represented in Congress by a Democrat as late as January 2004, when Representative and Rockwall resident Ralph Hall, a conservative Democrat, switched parties and became a Republican.

In recent years, though, especially as the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro area continues to grow and spill over into neighboring counties, the county&#x27;s Republican bent has lessened a bit. Native son George W. Bush received almost 79% of the vote in 2004.

=== Local government ===
Rockwall County is divided into four precincts, each represented by a county commissioner.

As of the most recent elections in 2020, all four commissioners are Republicans.

==Politics==
Robertson County was a longtime Democratic stronghold, as were many rural Southern counties during the Jim Crow and immediate post-Jim Crow eras (It had only voted for a Republican in the national Republican landslide of 1972, and even then, only by a single vote). In 2000, the last time the county went to a Democrat (Al Gore), it was one of only three majority-white rural counties (with Newton and Morris) to vote for Bill Clinton&#x27;s former vice president. None of the three have gone to a Democrat since.

<text>Roberts County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 827, making it the eighth-least populous county in Texas. Its county seat is Miami, which is also the county&#x27;s only incorporated community. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1889. It is named for Oran Milo Roberts, a governor of Texas. Roberts County is one of four prohibition (entirely dry) counties in the state of Texas.

==History==

The Plains Apache inhabited the Texas Panhandle until they were displaced by the Comanche who dominated the area until the 1870s. The Comanche hunted the large herds of buffalo, which grazed on the prairie. In the Red River War of 1874–75, United States Army troops led by Ranald S. Mackenzie drove out the Comanches. Simultaneously, buffalo hunters killed the large herds in the area, destroying the food supply and livelihood of the Plains tribes, making way for permanent settlement by Anglo-Americans.

In 1876, Roberts County was carved from the Bexar Territory and the Clay Land District. In 1887, the Southern Kansas Railway was built through Roberts County, and settlers followed.

Roberts County is the scene of a recent battle for water rights, where the City of Amarillo, Texas, the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority, and T. Boone Pickens have sought to purchase the water rights within the county. Between the three, they own 80% of the water rights.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (0.01%) is covered by water.

The county is relatively flat except for the Canadian River valley. Most of the land is used for cattle ranching. The county contains the Mesa Vista Ranch, which seeks to protect quail, dove, and pheasant habitat along the creek beds south of the Canadian River.

==Government and politics==











Roberts County was one of the earliest counties in Texas to begin supporting the Republican Party. The last Democrat to win the county in a presidential election was Harry S. Truman in 1948, when he carried nearly 76% of its ballots. No Democrat has since exceeded the 40% of the vote that Texas native Lyndon B. Johnson won in the county in his 1964 national landslide. Jimmy Carter in 1976 was the last Democrat to win even 30% of the county&#x27;s vote, Bill Clinton in 1996 to win 20%, Al Gore in 2000 to win 10%, and Barack Obama in 2012 to win 5%.

In recent years, Roberts County has become almost unanimously Republican. In 2008, 92% of voters voted for Republican John McCain versus only 7.92% for Democrat Barack Obama, making it one of the most Republican counties in the United States. In the 2016 presidential election, Republican Donald Trump received 94.58% of the vote, the largest margin in a county for a Republican in the U.S. that election. Roberts was again Trump&#x27;s strongest county in 2020, and he won it by an even stronger margin: 96.2%.

The county is governed by an elected county judge and four commissioners (each elected by a precinct within the county).

==Oil and gas==
Commercial gas was first discovered near the town of Refugio in 1920. Oil was first discovered near Refugio in 1928. The Refugio oil and gas field had produced 32 million barrels and 271 billion cubic feet of gas by the end of 1937. A major oil field was discovered at Greta in 1933. The Greta oilfield&#x27;s estimated cumulative recovery at abandonment are 152.5 million barrels of oil. The largest oilfield in Refugio county, the Tom O&#x27;Connor oil field, was discovered in 1934. The Tom O&#x27;Connor field&#x27;s estimated cumulative oil recovery at abandonment is 802.8 million barrels of oil and over 1 trillion cubic feet of gas. Other notable oil and gas fields in Refugio county, at least partially, include Anaqua, Bonnie View, Fagan, Huff, La Rosa, Mary Ellen O&#x27;Connor, and McFaddin oil and gas fields.

The Quintana Tom O&#x27;Connor No. 1-A discovery well&#x27;s location was based on a gravity survey and a trend of other fields in the southwest and northeast between the Vicksburg Fault Zone and the Frio Fault Zone. The field is a structural trap formed by an anticline on the downthrown side of the Vicksburg Fault Zone. The faulting is due to &quot;large-scale gravity slumping&quot;, and these types of faults are referred to as growth faults, which are normal faults that occur simultaneously with sedimentation. Most of the oil and half the gas is produced at depths between 4500 and 6000 feet, from 15 oil reservoirs and 4 gas reservoirs in the Oligocene Frio Formation sandstones deposited during Marine regression, notably the &quot;5900-foot sand&quot;, the &quot;5800-foot sand&quot;, the &quot;5500-foot sand&quot; and the &quot;5200-foot sand&quot;. Gas with some oil is found above these sandstones in the Oligocene Anahuac Formation, deposited in a Marine transgression, notably the &quot;4400-foot Greta sand&quot;. Dry gas is found in the Miocene-Pliocene Fleming sandstones deposited during marine regression, notably the &quot;L-4 sand, which is overlain by 1400 feet of Pleistocene Lissie sandstones.

The last major oil field discovered in Refugio county was the Lake Pasture oil field, discovered in 1953, with an estimated cumulative recovery at abandonment of 104 million barrels of oil.

==Healthcare==

<text>Reeves County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 14,748. Its county seat and most populous city is Pecos. The county was created in 1883 and organized the next year. It is named for George R. Reeves, a Texas state legislator and colonel in the Confederate Army. It is one of the nine counties that comprise the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. Reeves County comprises the Pecos micropolitan statistical area.

==History==

===Native Americans===
Prehistoric Clovis culture peoples in Reeves County lived in the rock shelters and caves nestled near water supplies. These people left behind artifacts and pictographs as evidence of their presence. Jumano Indians led the Antonio de Espejo 1582–1583 expedition near Toyah Lake on a better route to the farming and trade area of La Junta de los Ríos. Espejo&#x27;s diary places the Jumano along the Pecos River and its tributaries. The Mescalero Apache frequented San Solomon Springs to irrigate their crops. In 1849, John Salmon &quot;RIP&quot; Ford explored the area between San Antonio and El Paso, noting in his mapped report the productive land upon which the Mescalero Indians farmed.

===County established and growth===
The state legislature formed Reeves from Pecos County in 1883, and named it after Texas legislator and soldier George Robertson Reeves. The county was organized in 1884. The town of Pecos was named as county seat.

Toyah Valley farmers George B. and Robert E. Lyle were the first Anglo settlers 1871. White settlers started arriving in the area four years later, lured by open-range ranching. For the remainder of the century, the county economy was dependent upon farming and ranching as it moved into the manufacturing and oil industries of the 20th century.

The Texas and Pacific Railway built through Reeves County in 1881, with stations at Pecos and Toyah. By 1890, the Pecos River Railway had built from Pecos to New Mexico. Toyahvale, which means &quot;flowing water&quot;, became the western terminus of the railroad.

Balmorhea State Park was built at Toyahvale by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The park was deeded to the State of Texas in 1934 and opened to the public in 1968.

Pecos Army Air Field was one of the 120 airbases that trained the pioneer Women Airforce Service Pilots to fly military aircraft. At the Pecos installation, WASP flew AT-6, UC-78, and AT-17 aircraft in engineering tests, administrative duties, and transporting freight. The base was activated in 1942 as a World War II pilot school. The base was deactivated in 1945. At its peak, the base population of 4,034 rivaled the town of Pecos in size. Portions of the base were sold off over the years, with Pecos Municipal Airport retaining the remainder.

Pecos is the site of the largest private prison in the world, the Reeves County Detention Complex, operated by the GEO Group.

<text>Reagan County is a county on the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 3,385. The county seat is Big Lake. The county is named after John Henninger Reagan (1818–1905), who was the postmaster general of the Confederate States and also a U.S. senator, U.S. representative, and first chairman of the Railroad Commission of Texas.

==History==
The region was first inhabited by Paleo-Indian, Suma-Jumano, Kiowa and Comanche peoples. Captains Hernán Martín and Diego del Castillo explored the region in 1650. In 1684, Juan Domínguez de Mendoza and Nicolás López reported on local indigenous groups.

Butterfield Overland Mail, which operated from 1858 to 1861, crossed through the center of the county. In 1878, Camp Grierson&#x27;s Spring was established as a subpost of Fort Concho and named in honor of Col. Benjamin H. Grierson.

In 1903, Reagan County was carved from Tom Green County and named for United States Senator John Henninger Reagan. Stiles, named after local rancher William G. Stiles, became the first county seat. The Kansas City, Mexico and Orient of Texas Railway was completed in 1911.

In 1923, oil was discovered at the Big Lake Oilfield in the Permian Basin. Big Lake Oilfield, located on University of Texas System land, opened the Permian Basin to oil production and endowed the Permanent University Fund. The rig was named Santa Rita #1 for The Patron Saint of the Impossible. Big Lake was incorporated as a city. In 1924, shortly after the oil boom, the town community of Best plunged into vice and violence, necessitating the intervention of the Texas Rangers. The Rangers destroyed buildings that were being used as brothels, gambling houses, and saloons. In 1925, the county seat was moved to Big Lake by a vote. The following year, the Big Lake Oil Company established Texon for its employees and their families, with a devotion to family life.

In 1951, there was a renewed oil boom from production in the Spraberry Trend.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.06%) is covered by water. The Spraberry Trend, the third-largest oil field in the United States by remaining reserves, underlies much of the county.

<doc id="91474" wikidata="Q113962" url="?curid=91474" title="Presidio County, Texas">
<text>Presidio County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 6,131. Its county seat is Marfa. The county was created in 1850 and later organized in 1875. Presidio County (K-5 in Texas topological index of counties) is in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas and is named for the border settlement of Presidio del Norte. It is on the Rio Grande, which forms the Mexican border.

==History==

===Native Americans===
Paleo-Indians (hunter-gatherers) existed thousands of years ago on the Trans-Pecos, and often did not adapt to culture clashes, European diseases, and colonization. The Masames tribe was exterminated by the Tobosos, &quot;circa&quot; 1652. The Nonojes suffered from clashes with the Spanish and merged with the Tobosos. The Spanish made slave raids to the La Junta de los Ríos, committing cruelties against the native population. The Suma-Jumano tribe sought to align themselves with the Spanish for survival. The tribe later merged with the Apache people. Foraging peoples who did not survive the 18th century include the Chisos, Mansos, Jumanos, Conchos, Julimes, Cibolos, Tobosos, Sumas, Cholomes, Caguates, Nonojes, Cocoyames, and Acoclames.

===Early explorations and settlements===
The &quot;entrada&quot; of Juan Domínguez de Mendoza and Father Nicolás López in 1683–84 set out from El Paso to La Junta, where they established seven missions at seven pueblos. In 1683, Father López celebrated the first Christmas Mass in Texas at La Junta.

In 1832, José Ygnacio Ronquillo was issued a conditional land grant, and established the county&#x27;s first white settlement on Cibolo Creek. Military obligations forced him to abandon the settlement, and he then sold the land.

The Chihuahua Trail connecting Mexico&#x27;s state of Chihuahua with Santa Fe, New Mexico, opened in 1839.

By 1848, Ben Leaton built Fort Leaton, sometimes called the largest adobe structure in Texas, on the river as his home, trading post, and private bastion. Leaton died in debt in 1851, with the fort passing to the holder of the mortgage, John Burgess. In 1934, T. C. Mitchell and the Marfa State Bank acquired the old structure and donated it to the county as a historic site. The park was opened to the public in 1978.

Milton Faver became the county&#x27;s first cattle baron. In 1857, he moved his family to Chinati Mountains in the county. Milton Faver bought small tracts of land around three springs-Cibolo, Cienega, and La Morita and established cattle ranches. He built Fort Cienega and Fort Cibolo.

===County established and growth===
Presidio County was established from Bexar County on January 3, 1850. Fort Leaton became the county seat. The county was organized in 1875 as the largest county in the United States, with . Fort Davis was named the county seat. The boundaries and seat of Presidio County were changed in the 1880s. Marfa was established in 1883, and the county seat was moved there from Fort Davis in 1885.

In 1854, the army built Fort Davis in northern Presidio County.
Fort Davis closed during the Civil War and reopened in 1867. The black population increased to 489 when Buffalo Soldiers were stationed at Fort Davis.

John W. Spencer, a local rancher and trader, found a silver deposit in the Chinati Mountains in 1880 that resulted in the opening of Presidio Mine and the beginning of the company town of Shafter. From 1883 until 1942, the mine produced over 32.6 million ounces of silver.

The railroad reached Presidio County in 1882, when the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway laid tracks through its northeastern corner.
W. F. Mitchell built the first barbed wire fence in the county at Antelope Springs in 1888. The widespread use of barbed wire resulted in the refinement of cattle breeds, improvement of ranges, and innovative use of water supplies.

Windmills, water wells, and earthen tanks were introduced on Presidio County ranches in the late 1880s.

Elephant Butte Dam was built in 1910 on the Rio Grande, creating a large, reliable irrigation source for the county.

The growth of Presidio County&#x27;s population in the 1910s reflected the impact of the Mexican Revolution on border life. Refugees migrated to the county from Chihuahua as the fighting moved into northern Mexico. The United States Army established several posts in the county. Marfa became the headquarters for the Big Bend Military District, and in 1917, the Army established Camp Marfa, later called Fort D. A. Russell, at Marfa to protect the border. As Presidio County entered the 1930s the people faced a drought and a population decline. Low silver prices closed Presidio Mine at Shafter. Economic recovery began by 1936. During World War II, Presidio County enjoyed economic prosperity as the home for two military installations-Fort Russell and Marfa Army Airfield.

In late January 1918, during a period of tension between the US and Mexico, Texas Rangers and citizens of the village of Porvenir murdered 15 local Hispanic residents.

The economy of the county in 1982 was based primarily on agriculture, with 83% of the land in farms and ranches.

===Marfa Lights===

Wagon trains on the Chihuahua Trail reported seeing unexplained lights in the mid-19th century. The first recorded incident of the Marfa Lights was in 1883 when Robert Reed Ellison and cowhands camped at Mitchell Flats.
They thought the lights might have been Apaches, but later found no evidence of an Apache encampment. Since that time, the lights continue to appear between Marfa and Paisano Pass. Speculation and fascination spark imaginations about the source. Some say they are caused by car headlights; some say extraterrestrial visitors. One theory is that the lights are similar to a mirage caused by atmospheric conditions. Marfa celebrates with a Mystery Lights Festival every Labor Day.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.02%) is covered by water. It is the fourth-largest county in Texas by area.

Presidio County is triangular in shape and is bounded on the east by Brewster County, on the north by Jeff Davis County, and on the south and west for by the Rio Grande and Mexico. Marfa, the county seat, is southeast of El Paso and southwest of Odessa. The center of the county lies at 30°30&#x27; north latitude and 104°15&#x27; west longitude.

Geographically, Presidio County comprises of contrasting topography, geology, and vegetation.

In the north and west, clay and sandy loam cover the rolling plains known as the Marfa Plateau and the Highland Country, providing good ranges of grama grasses for the widely acclaimed Highland Herefords.

In the central, far western, and southeastern areas of the county, some of the highest mountain ranges in Texas are found. These peaks are formed of volcanic rock and covered with loose surface rubble. They support desert shrubs and cacti and dominate a landscape of rugged canyons and numerous springs. The spring-fed Capote Falls, with a drop of , the highest in Texas, is located in western Presidio County.

In the southern and western parts of the county, the volcanic cliffs of the Candelaria Rimrock (also called the Sierra Vieja) rise perpendicular and run parallel to the river, separating the highland prairies from the desert floor hundreds of feet below them. The gravel pediment, which allows only the growth of desert shrubs and cacti, extends from the Rimrock to the flood plain of the river.

Along the Rio Grande River, irrigation allows the farming of vegetables, grains, and cotton. No permanent streams exist in the county, although many arroyos become raging torrents during heavy rainfalls. Major arroyos are Alamito Creek, Cibolo Creek, Capote Creek, and Pinto Canyon. San Esteban Dam was built across Alamito Creek about south of Marfa and on the site of a historic spring-fed &quot;tinaja&quot; in 1911 as an irrigation and land-promotion project. The reservoir lake is a source of water for irrigation. Tinaja refers to a depression in the land formed by water flow from a spring, or under a waterfall. In this arid county, it is due to the spring. Capote Falls, which is formed by Capote Creek, is the tallest waterfall in the state.

Altitudes in the county vary from above sea level. Temperatures, moderated by the mountains, vary from in January to in July. Average rainfall is per year, mainly in June, July, and August. The growing season extends for 238 days.

Natural resources under production in 1982 were perlite, crushed rhyolite, sand, and gravel. Silver mining contributed greatly to the economy of the county from the 1880s to the 1940s. Presidio County has no oil or gas production.

Temperatures are coolest and rainfall most abundant in the higher elevations of the Davis and Chinati Mountains. By contrast, the lowlands along the Rio Grande along the southern and western areas of the county are dry with often extreme summer daytime heat and where winter snowfall is unusual. Throughout the county, May through October marks the rainy season, while the remainder of the year is predominantly dry.

==History==
===LX Ranch===
The LX Ranch was established in the county by W.H. &quot;Deacon&quot; Bates and David T. Beals by 1877. In July 1876, Bates, along with some cowboys that included Charlie Siringo, established a herd of steers and ranch headquarters along Ranch Creek on the north bank of the Canadian River. The headquarters eventually included a bunkhouse, kitchen, storeroom, stables, corrals, blacksmith shop, wagon sheds, and a post office named Wheeler. The LX also established the county&#x27;s first cemetery. The ranch eventually extended from Dumas to the Palo Duro Canyon and 35 miles east to west. By 1884, the ranch encompassed 187,000 acres, 45,000 cattle, and 1000 horses, when the operation was sold to the American Pastoral Company. In 1902, the ranch headquarters were moved to Bonita Creek, on the south bank of the Canadian River. On October 6, 1910, that company sold 30,354 acres south of the river to Lee Bivins, and on June 1, 1911, R.B. &quot;Ben&quot; Masterson acquired 89,139 acres on the north side. On May 19, 1915, Bivins bought an additional 53,329 LX acres, which included the LX brand.

<text>Pecos County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 15,193. The county seat is Fort Stockton. The county was created in 1871 and organized in 1875. It is named for the Pecos River. It is one of the nine counties that comprise the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas.

==History==

===Native Americans===

Archeological digs at Tunas Peak uncovered prehistoric hunter-gatherer artifacts. Fourteen clusters of stones interpreted as wickiup and tipi rings indicate human habitation. A ring midden in the camp provided a radiocarbon date of 1300 AD. Archeological finds along Tunas Creek include a burial site, pictographs, and artifacts; one is a possible modified Langtry projectile point (2,000 BC to 700–800 AD).

===Early routes===

The Comanche Trail crossed Pecos County near Horsehead Crossing and through Comanche Springs.
The Chihuahua Trail connecting Mexico&#x27;s state of Chihuahua with Santa Fe, New Mexico, brought travelers through the area by Comanche Springs about 1840.

A United States Army outpost, Fort Stockton, was established in 1858 at Comanche Springs to guard the San Antonio-El Paso Mail. That same year, the Butterfield Overland Mail began service to the army post.

===County established and growth===

The town of Fort Stockton began near the Fort Stockton army post at Comanche Springs as St. Gaul, Texas, but was renamed Fort Stockton in 1880. Pecos County was established by the Texas Legislature in 1871 originally out of Presidio County. In 1871, Pecos County was organized and St. Gaul was named the county seat. About 1,100 people were living in the county that year. By 1890, the county had 227 cattle and 150 sheep, and were planted in corn. By 1900, the area&#x27;s economy had become almost completely dominated by cattle and sheep ranching, though plots of wheat, rye, corn, and oats were grown. Around 1900, a small settlement known as Sheffield sprang up in eastern Pecos County on land owned by Will Sheffield; it served as a supply point for the surrounding ranches. In 1913, construction of the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway across Pecos County caused a boom in land speculation and community growth, as did irrigation projects along the Pecos River. The town of Girvin, named for rancher John H. Girvin, grew around a train stop on the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway that served as a cattle-shipping point. Construction of Texas State Highway 290 linking Fort Stockton to Big Bend National Park gave a boost to tourism. In the 1980s, the economy of Pecos County continued to be based on farming, ranching, oil and gas production, and tourism. The Yates Oil Field in Crockett, and Pecos counties in 1927 resulted in a financial boom period for the county. Towns such as Red Barn, Iraan (combination of the names Ira and Ann Yates), and Bakersfield rose up in response to oil-related employment opportunities. The population of the county more than doubled during the 1920s. Oil production helped to stabilize the local economy.

===Alley Oop and Paisano Pete===

The town of Iraan, Texas, prides itself on being the birthplace of cartoon caveman Alley Oop, when creator V.T. Hamlin worked in the oilfields. Although first published in the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; in 1932, Hamlin claimed to have originated the idea while he watched dinosaur bones being dug up by oil equipment. Visitors to Iraan can visit the Alley Oop Museum found on Alley Oop Lane. Fort Stockton pays tribute to the agile roadrunner with its Paisano Pete the Roadrunner statue.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (0.02%) is covered by water. It is the second-largest county by area in Texas.

===Yates Oil Field===
Pecos County is home to one of the largest oil fields in the United States, the Yates Oil Field, which is in the extreme eastern part of the county, along the Pecos River. The field covers about near the town of Iraan. Discovered in 1926, it has produced over a billion barrels of oil, and most industry estimates give it more than another billion in recoverable reserves. The Yates Oil Field was one of the first giant fields to be found in the Permian Basin.

===Williams Regional Technical Training Center===
Pecos County is home to the Midland College/Williams Regional Technical Training Center, located alongside Interstate Highway 10, in Fort Stockton. The center was built in 1996 through a joint effort by Midland College, and by leaders of Fort Stockton education, business, and government as a means to enhance higher education and workforce development in this part of West Texas. Fort Stockton and Pecos County are part of the Midland College service area. After just four years, the facility, named in honor of Fort Stockton native and center donor Clayton Williams Jr. was doubled in size through fundraising and program development.

<text>Palo Pinto County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 28,409. The county seat is Palo Pinto. The county was created in 1856 and organized the following year.

Palo Pinto County comprises the Mineral Wells micropolitan statistical area, which is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth combined statistical area. It is located in the western Cross Timbers ecoregion.

==History==
===Native Americans===

The Brazos Indian Reservation, founded by General Randolph B. Marcy in 1854, provided a safety area from warring Comanche for Delaware, Shawnee, Tonkawa, Wichita, Choctaw, and Caddo. Within the reservation, each tribe had its own village and cultivated agricultural crops. Government-contracted beef cattle were delivered each week. Citizens were unable to distinguish between reservation and nonreservation tribes, blaming Comanche and Kiowa depredations on the reservation Indians. A newspaper in Jacksboro, Texas, titled &quot;The White Man &quot; advocated removal of all tribes from North Texas.

During December 1858, Choctaw Tom, who was a Yowani married to a Hasinai woman, who was at times an interpreter to Sam Houston, and a group of reservation Indians received permission for an off-the-reservation hunt. On December 27, Captain Peter Garland and a vigilante group charged Choctaw Tom&#x27;s camp, indiscriminately murdering and injuring women and children along with the men.

Governor Hardin Richard Runnels ordered John Henry Brown to the area with 100 troops. An examining trial was conducted about the Choctaw Tom raid, but no indictments resulted.

In May 1859, John Baylor and a number of whites confronted United States troops at the reservation, demanding the surrender of certain tribal individuals. The military balked, and Baylor retreated, but in so doing killed an Indian woman and an old man. Baylor&#x27;s group was later attacked by Indians off the reservation, where the military had no authority to intervene. At the behest of terrified settlers, the reservation was abandoned that year.

===County established===

In 1856, the Texas State Legislature established Palo Pinto County from Bosque and Navarro Counties and named it for Palo Pinto Creek. The county was organized the next year, with the town of Golconda chosen to be the seat of government. The town was renamed Palo Pinto in 1858.

===Early ranching and farming years===

Ranching entrepreneurs Oliver Loving and Charles Goodnight, who blazed the Goodnight-Loving Trail, along with Reuben Vaughan, were the nucleus of the original settlers. An 1876 area rancher meeting regarding cattle rustling became the beginnings of what is now known as the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.

The Fence Cutting Wars in Texas lasted about 5 years, 1883–1888. As farmers and ranchers began to compete for precious land and water, cattlemen found feeding their herds more difficult, prompting cowboys to cut through fences. Texas Governor John Ireland prodded a special assembly to order the fence cutters to cease. In response, the legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning crimes punishable with prison time, while at the same time regulating fencing. The practice abated with sporadic incidents of related violence in 1888.

===Later growth years===

James and Amanda Lynch first moved to the area in 1877. In digging a well on their property, they discovered the water seemed to benefit their well-being. Word spread about the water&#x27;s healing powers, and people from all over came to experience the benefits. Eventually, the town of Mineral Wells was platted.

Mineral Wells State Park and Trailway, a short distance to east of the town of Mineral Wells in Palo Pinto County, was opened to the public in 1981; it lies in Parker County.

The Texas National Guard organized the 56th Cavalry Brigade in 1921, and four years later, Brigadier General Jacob F. Wolters was given a grant to construct a training camp for the unit. In 1941, Camp Wolters was turned over to the United States Army. It was redesignated Wolters Air Force Base in 1951. Five years later, the base reverted to the Army as a helicopter training school. The base closed in 1973 when the helicopter school transferred to Fort Rucker (now Fort Novosel) in Alabama.

Possum Kingdom Lake was acquired from the Brazos River Authority in 1940. The Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the facilities, and the Possum Kingdom State Park opened to the public in 1950.

<text>Oldham County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,758. Its county seat is Vega. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1881. Oldham County is included in the Amarillo, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Oldham County was formed in 1876 and organized in 1881, and named for Williamson Simpson Oldham, Sr., a Texas pioneer and Confederate Senator. At the time of its organization, about half of the county was a part of the XIT Ranch. The county seat was originally at the town of Tascosa, Texas, which in the 1880s was one of the largest towns in the Panhandle. As the railroads came through the county, however, they bypassed Tascosa; several new towns and farms sprang up along the rail lines, and by 1915 Tascosa had a courthouse and almost no residents; the county seat was moved to Vega that year. Oldham County is primarily ranch and farm land, with many thousands of acres planted in wheat, the major crop. The county also has some petroleum production and large wind farms.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.06%) is water. A southern strip of the county, including the county seat, Vega, is located on top of the Llano Estacado (Staked Plains). The next stretch, comprising approximately 12 miles, slopes down to the Canadian River. The former county seat of Tascosa is located at a crossing of the Canadian River, north of Vega. The terrain then slopes up from the Canadian River, passing the county line at approximately six miles and reaching the top of the High Plains a further four miles north.

===Border dispute with New Mexico===
For years, there has been a simmering dispute over a strip of land running north and south, including an abandoned part of Glenrio at the western end of Oldham County, as to which state it is lawfully a part of. The border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the current towns of Farwell, Texline and the eastern part of Glenrio appear to be within the State of Texas. New Mexico&#x27;s short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico&#x27;s draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law.

The question was once settled in favor of Texas by the intervention of President William Howard Taft, at the request of Senator John Villiers Farwell, whose three-million-acre XIT Ranch would have been diminished by New Mexico&#x27;s claim. With Taft&#x27;s support, on February 16, 1911, the Joint Resolution of Congress on admitting New Mexico as a state declared that any provision of New Mexico&#x27;s constitution that &quot;...in any way tends to annul or change the boundary lines between the State of Texas and Territory of New Mexico shall be of no force and effect.&quot; 

Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys, and the land and towns (the east part of Glenrio in Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties) for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.

==Politics==

=== United States Congress ===
===Political culture===
Newton County was once one of the most Democratic-leaning counties in East Texas and the Deep South altogether. Until 1968, the county had voted for the Democratic candidate in every election since Texas first participated in 1848 (excluding the 1860, 1864, and 1868 elections when the state had seceded). Even when Republicans Herbert Hoover and Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Texas in 1928, 1952, and 1956, respectively, Newton County remained Democratic, usually by wide margins.

The Democratic streak in Newton County was ended in 1968 when American Independent Party candidate George Wallace narrowly won the county with 42.6% of the vote against Democrat Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s 41.7%. President Richard Nixon in 1972 became the first Republican to ever win the county in an election with 54% of the vote against Democrat George McGovern&#x27;s 45.4%. After 1972, the county returned to voting Democratic, surviving the landslide elections of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in 1980, 1984, and 1988, respectively. In fact, Newton County was Walter Mondale&#x27;s strongest county in East Texas in the 1984 election, winning 60.6% of the vote, and one of only four in the region to vote for him. Michael Dukakis in 1988 remains the last Democratic presidential candidate to win over 60% of the vote in the county.

Since 1988, the Democratic percentage in Newton County has decreased in every election, culminating in Al Gore&#x27;s narrow win in 2000 with 50.16% against Governor George W. Bush&#x27;s 48.56%. As of 2024, Gore remains the last Democrat to win the county&#x27;s votes in a presidential election. Since 2004, the Republican candidate has comfortably carried the county in every election, with Bush winning 55.42% in 2004, John McCain winning 65.51% in 2008, Mitt Romney winning 70.06% in 2012 and Donald Trump winning 77.48% and 80.11% in 2016 and 2020 respectively.

Cotton was most important, but farmers also cultivated other commodity crops before the American Civil War.

<text>Montague County ( ulation) is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas, established in 1857. As of the 2020 census, its population was 19,965. The county seat is Montague. The county was created in 1857 and organized the next year. It is named for Daniel Montague, a surveyor and soldier in the Mexican–American War.

==History==
In the mid- to late 19th century, the county was the site of the trading post known as Red River Station, established near the river of the same name by Jesse Chisholm, a Cherokee merchant who also served as an important interpreter for the Republic of Texas and the United States. Together with Black Bear, a Lenape guide, he had scouted and developed what became known as the Chisholm Trail north through Indian Territory, where he had more trading posts, and into Kansas.

In the post-Civil War period, ranchers suffered from low prices for their beef cattle, as overproduction had occurred during the war, when their regular markets were cut off. Learning about high prices and demand in the East, they began to have their cattle driven to railheads in Kansas for shipment to the east. Red River Station became the southern terminus for the Chisholm Trail, and the gathering place for thousands of Texas Longhorns during annual cattle drives to railheads in Kansas. Over the years, an estimated five million cattle were driven north to Kansas. The cattle were gathered by cowboys from ranches in East and West Texas; the cattle were then driven overland north to Kansas. They were shipped east, where they could command much higher prices. After railroads were constructed into Texas, the cattle drives to Kansas ended.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.8%) are covered by water.

==Politics==
Republican Drew Springer, a businessman from Muenster in Cooke County, represents Montague County in the Texas House of Representatives. He carried the county in the 2012 Republican runoff election.

Prior to 1996, Montague County was strongly Democratic in presidential elections. The only Republican Party candidates who managed to win the county from 1912 to 1992 were Herbert Hoover in 1928 and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their 49-state landslides of 1972 and 1984, respectively. Since 1996, the county has swung hard to the supporting Republican Party, in similar fashion to almost all white-majority rural counties in the Solid South.

<doc id="91495" wikidata="Q156463" url="?curid=91495" title="Mills County, Texas">
<text>Located near the center of Texas, Mills County is located in Central Texas, United States. It was created on March 15, 1887, from parts of four existing counties—Brown, Comanche, Hamilton, and Lampasas—and named after John T. Mills. The 2020 census reported a population of 4,456. The county seat is Goldthwaite. A long-time resident of the county quipped that residing here is the closest a person could get to living in Mayberry.

==History==

The Clovis are the earliest known people to inhabit the territory before Mills County, though recent discoveries indicate that there were people living in the area as far back as 15,000 to 20,000 years. More recently, the Tonkawa occupied it, and there are numerous vestiges from their campsites that remain across the county, including cooking middens. Thought to be the first white man to explore pre-Mills County, Pedro Vial visited in 1786 and 1789 while traveling between San Antonio and Santa Fe. Captain Henry S. Brown, believed to be the first white visitor, led a group to the area in 1825 to recover stolen stock. Mills County was once a part of two Mexican municipalities, Milam (originally Viesca Municipality) and Bastrop (originally Mina Municipality).

The Comanche regularly hunted in pre-Mills County since it was located along the southeastern edge of a large buffalo range. Native tribes moved through the area via what locals called &quot;The Comanche Trail,&quot; which led to southern Texas. Starting in the 1840s, aggressive groups of Comanche and Apache pushed the Tonkawa out and raided the area in an effort to keep control of it as late as 1850, frequently stealing horses and scalping settlers who had started to move there in numbers after 1855. The earliest settlers arrived when there were no fences and land was free.

Eventually the Apache moved west, leaving the Comanche in control. Earlier, in 1835, the General Council of Texas sent the first Texas Rangers to aid settlers. In 1854, the Texas Legislature appropriated land located on the Texas frontier, built a series of reservations, and moved the natives there starting in 1855, yet there continued to be native incursions into white settlements. By the mid 1870s, native violence began to diminish, yet leading up to the 1880s, Comanche and Kiowa continued to attack the area. Comanches raided Williams Ranch in the late 1870s, the last recorded assault in the area.

The earliest communities in pre-Mills County were Center City and Hanna Valley, both organized in 1854. One source identifies the David Morris, Sr., and Dick Jenkins families as the first pioneers in the area, who settled south of present-day Center City in 1852. Killed by the natives, Dick Jenkins is thought to be the first person buried in what was to become Mills County.

Williams Ranch, established in 1855 in Brown County, was the first community that developed into a large, dynamic town after establishing trade with Mexico and serving as a major center for cattle business, capitalizing on its location near the Western Cattle Trail. The town served as the &quot;headquarters&quot; of the West Texas frontier and was expected to serve as the county seat. &quot;Old Fort Phantom Hill Road,&quot; the only military route that crossed Mills County, passed through Williams Ranch, connecting Austin and Fort Phantom Hill, located north of Abilene. In 1876, a telegraph line was built along the road, later to be known as the &quot;Wire Road.&quot; The Florida Hotel (locally referred to as the Hutch Hotel) at Williams Ranch hosted a telegraph office operated by Hallie Hutchinson, the first woman telegraph operator in the U.S. The telegraph line connected Austin and Fort Concho. It was eventually replaced by a telephone line that was thought to be the longest in the United States.

A federal military facility, Camp Colorado, was established in 1856 near the community of Ebony. Numerous wagon and stage coach trails crisscrossed the area during this time. &quot;Fort Phantom Hill Trail,&quot; a military route that connected Fort Phantom Hill and Austin, passed through the territory.

During the Civil War and following Reconstruction, an unprecedented number of people moved west looking for a better life, attracted by plentiful and inexpensive land. Some of them settled in the area before Mills County formed and helped establish the early communities. Records demonstrate that 1876 marked the largest influx of immigrants into the area.

Most of the early settlers lived according to Christian principles they brought with them that were reinforced by religious leaders in their new communities. That said, gun altercations to settle differences were common, and legal repercussions were usually immaterial.

This isolated part of Texas, popularly referred to as a &quot;no man&#x27;s land,&quot; also attracted a variety of criminals, and minimal and often corrupt law enforcement allowed crime to surge. The first law officer was W.W. Queen, who took his position in 1883 before Mills County formed; there are no reliable records documenting the existence of law enforcement officers before then. Other sustained problems roiled the area, including native incursions, conflicts related to the cattle business, community feuds, agrarian discontent, and political unrest. This tumultuous environment was a crucible for violence. Only a few pioneers joined the Confederate Army during the Civil War because they were needed at home to fight their own &quot;war&quot; against the attacks of natives and outlaws.

Originally organized to protect settlers, vigilante &quot;committees&quot; formed with the tacit approval of law officials that degenerated into thieving, vindictive, and murderous groups that terrorized the area, killing an estimated one hundred people during their reign in Central Texas. Also known as &quot;The Assembly,&quot; they were veiled in secrecy and bound by a strict code of silence, which heightened settlers&#x27; fear. The earliest one started at Williams Ranch in 1869, called the &quot;Honest Man&#x27;s Club,&quot; that was supposed to rid the town of criminals. Soon a feud erupted between it and another group, the &quot;Trigger Mountain Mob,&quot; which was the salvo that launched the mob&#x27;s rule. Groups operating in Mills County were sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;The Mills County Mob.&quot; The mob&#x27;s control of the area started to subside with the arrival of the railroad in 1887, which helped bring civilized norms. The Texas Rangers were eventually called to the territory in 1890 to quell the mob&#x27;s depravities, though its activity continued into the early twentieth century.

By 1885, the pre-Mills area had reached a population of 6,493 and had become civilized enough to justify forming a new county. At the time, the only significant communities were Center City, Mullin, Star, and Williams Ranch. Both Goldthwaite and Mullin were only tent villages.

Known as &quot;The Father of Mills County,&quot; district representative and Williams Ranch resident Phil H. Clements (1854–1932) lobbied in Austin for a new county in 1887, though planning for the county had started in 1885. There was opposition to creating the new county—Brown County, in particular, fought against it.

In an action of the twentieth Texas Legislature, Governor L.S. &quot;Sul&quot; Ross approved H.S.S.B. No. 85 on March 15, 1887, which carved Mills County out of parts of Brown, Comanche, Hamilton, and Lampasas counties—all of which were created much earlier in the mid-to-late 1850s. It was named after John T. Mills, honoring his service as a Republic of Texas Supreme Court justice. The bill provided directions for conducting an election to determine government leaders and the location of the county seat.

Brown County Commissioners Court met on July 25, 1887, with Brown County Judge R.P. Conner presiding, to began organizing the government of Mills County. The court created five justices precincts, four commissioners precincts, and assigned ten residents to carry out the county&#x27;s first election of its officials. The ten voting places and election administrators were: no. 1. Mullin, M.C. Kirkpatrick; no. 2. Jon Ward&#x27;s house, A.N. Perkins; no. 3. Center City, F.M. Ragsdale; no. 4. Parson Priddy&#x27;s house, A.P. Kelly; no. 5. Goldthwaite, John James; no. 6. Pleasant Grove School house on Sims Creek, Phil McCormick; no. 7. Big Valley, M.V. Nowell; no. 8. Rock Springs, J.E. McGowan; no. 9. Regency, Sam Jones; and no. 10. Buffalo School house, H.G. Ratliff. The winners of the election met with Judge Conner on Monday, September 12, 1887, in Goldthwaite, to take oaths and began their duties. September 12, 1887, is recognized as the date the county was organized. The first elected officials of county were: J.B. Head, county judge; G.H. Dalton, commissioner, precinct no. 1; D.S. Kelly, Commissioner, precinct no. 3; S.M. Moore, commissioner, precinct no. 4; George W. Cunningham, sheriff; and Phil H. Clements, county clerk. A special election held on October 10, 1889, determined Goldthwaite as the county seat, beating Mullin and Pegtown. The first legal actions at the Mills County clerk&#x27;s office was to issue a marriage license and to file a divorce suit, and both transactions were instigated by Black couples.

An earlier piece of legislation, House Bill No. 421, would have created a county with a similar boundary as Mills called &quot;Key,&quot; but the bill was defeated on February 21, 1881. An early General Land Office map dated March 10, 1879, references Mills County and names a place in the center of the county, &quot;Winona.&quot;

== Geography, topography, and natural features ==
Located in West Central Texas near the center of the state, Mills County incorporates portions of the Limestone Cut Plain and Western Cross Timber subregions of the Cross Plains ecoregion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. Elevation varies from 1,200 to 1,750 feet.

The Colorado River marks the county&#x27;s distinctive southwestern border and creates three fertile farming valleys: Big Valley, Jones Valley, and Hanna Valley. The Pecan Bayou enters the western part of the county from Brown County then flows east and south towards the Colorado River; Blanket and Brown creeks unite into the Pecan Bayou along the way. From west to east, the following streams drain into the Colorado River: Comanche Creek, Buffalo Creek, Rough Creek, King Creek, Pecan Bayou, Prescott Creek, Bull Creek, Nabors Creek, and Shaw Creek. North and South Bennett Creeks and Simms Creek, all in the eastern part of the county, drain into the Lampasas River. The northern parts of the county have Mountain Creek, Cowhouse Creek, and Washboard Creek that eventually drain into the Brazos River.

The county&#x27;s topography features low, broken hills. The Cowhouse Mountains, which are part of an extensive range of hills located in the Lampasas Cut Plain, cross the county from the southeast to the northwest. One part of the Cowhouse range enters the county north of Star and leaves the county north of Priddy; another part of Cowhouse enters the county near Moline before taking a northwesterly exit into Comanche County. San Saba Peak, at a height of 1,712 feet, is a prominent mountain in the county and was named in 1732 by Don Juan Antonio Bustillo y Cevallos, Spanish Governor of Texas.

Central Texas, which includes Mills County, contains some of the oldest rocks in the state.

The county has a variety of soils, including gray loams, sandy dark and stone clay, and alluvia in the bottom lands, and black wax on the prairies. Very shallow to deep, loamy, and clayey soils and their sub-varieties make up the bulk of the county. Plentiful limestone, sand, and gravel are used for road construction.

Native timbers include live oak (entire county), post oak (entire county), Spanish oak (Grand Prairie Region), eastern cottonwood (along streams), shinnery oak (Cowhouse Mountains Region), mesquite (concentrated in western county), pecan (along streams), and cedar. Cactus varieties typically grow in the Cross Timbers Region. Dominant trees and shrubs include ashe juniper (&quot;Juniperus ashei&quot; J. Bucholz), escarpment live oak (&quot;Quercus fusiformis&quot; Small), and the deciduous shrub, honey mesquite (&quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot; Torr). A member of the Cypress family, Ashe juniper is one of six species of the &quot;Juniperus&quot; genus that grow in Texas, but it is the only one that grows in the Hill Country, including Mills County, where it is concentrated in the southern region. It is the most plentiful native tree growing in the county and has existed in the area for thousands of years. Both Ashe juniper and honey mesquite are considered to be invasive trees in the area.

The county flower is the Texas Plume Standing Cypress.

== Climate ==
Mills County typically offers hot summers and cool winters. Rainfall tends to be spread throughout the year, and snowfall is infrequent. The county receives an average of 25-26 inches of rain a year based on historical records. Records show a high historical yearly rainfall of 26.75 inches. Averaging fourteen miles per hour, prevailing winds come from the south-southeast. The county&#x27;s growing season last 230 days. The Köppen Climate Classification for Goldthwaite, the county seat, is &quot;humid subtropical&quot; (Cfa).

Highest monthly precipitation was 13.71 inches, recorded in October 2018.

One long-time county resident recalls the acute droughts of 2011 and the seven-year drought that occurred in the 1950s.

Grundy, were carried out between 1887 and 1890 under the tree before Mills County formed. The tree also furnished shade for the first school classes. In the early 1870s, many expected Center City to be named county seat as a logical choice based on its history as a hub for freight and stage line. A town square plan was developed by Mr. and Mrs. Hughes that accommodated a courthouse, and eventually a list of businesses sprung up, including several saloons, a drug store, two blacksmith shops, a hotel, and several other stores. It was a centrally located resting point for postal carriers. Its first church was organized in 1875 and was used for school and lodge. During its peak, the population is estimated to have reach 1,000 citizens. Likewise, residents anticipated the railroad to pass through the town, but it did not.

== Demographics ==

A 2022 report showed that home values in Mills County increased at a record rate compared to other counties in the state, rising by 98.7% since November 2017. An average home ballooned from $179,000 to over $355,000.

== Religion ==
Early settlers in the mid-1850s represented a range of faiths, led in numbers by the Methodists. During the county&#x27;s formation days, denominations were less important. Early sermons were delivered by circuit riders, and a Methodist rider delivered the first religious service at the home of Charles Mullin in 1857. Later brush arbor revivals became popular before camp meetings started attracting congregants.

A 1972 study canvassing citizens of Star and Center City revealed that a majority of citizens had Protestant fundamentalist spiritual beliefs, with over 80% affiliated with Baptist, Methodist, or Church of Christ denominations.

The Mills County Historical Commission details fifty-seven cemeteries in Mills County. Early settlers buried their dead near their homes in post oak slabs fashioned into coffins by the local carpenter.
== Economy and industry ==
The county has historically sustained its economy with farming and ranching operations of varying sizes, with small businesses and recreational hunting providing additional income. By 1890, agriculture had established an economic base in the county. Agritourism, including recreational hunting and fishing, continues to supplement the economy. The county&#x27;s deer population started growing after screwworm eradication programs were developed.

Mineral resources in the county are minimal: a small vein of coal was discovered near Ebony around 1950, and Weston No. 1 Well, located in the Rock Springs Community, produced very little gas and oil. Much later, in 1982, oil made another appearance, yielding 28,122 barrels, yet by 1990, oil production ceased.

==== Statistics ====

Records show that the county has featured a large population of sheep and goats. Sheep reached a peak of 133,737 head in 1940, and goats reached a peak of 118,009 in 1964. Cattle fluctuated from a low of 16,279 head in 1940 to a high of 48,901 in 1978. Total animal units in the county was 41,745 in 1935 before reaching a peak of 69,429 AU in 1969. The 2012 agricultural census reported 34,294 sheep, 23,325 goats, and 32,663 head of cattle, with 42,568 AU. Average ranch size was 109 hectares in 1935 before reaching a peak size of 256 hectares in 1969. The 2012 agricultural census reported a decrease to an average size of 219 hectares.

By 1890, there were 680 farms and ranches in the county, consisting of 142,299 acres, with 25,000 head of cattle and 23,000 sheep.

By 1930, the county produced 32,000 acres of cotton, 21,300 head of cattle, 68,000 goats (many raised for mohair), 78,000 sheep, and 67,000 chickens.

In 1979, Mills County ranked among the top ten Texas counties in the mohair industry: eighth in number of Angora goats (38,000 head) and seventh in pounds of mohair produced (386,000 pounds). Total county income in 1979 from both mohair and wool reached more than $65.9 million.

==== General history ====
Farming and ranching in the county have historically had about equal importance, and most agricultural operations had both. The natural resources of pre-Mills county in Brown, Comanche, Hamilton, and Lampasas counties offered good support for early farming and ranching, yet most of the early settlers made their living by hunting. Game provided food and pelts were often sent to Houston to sell. By the early 1890s, large game such as bear, panther, and jaguar had been evacuated from the county, leaving hunters smaller game such as bobcat, fox, wolf, coon, and possums. Game was the only substantive food for early settlers; deer, however, served various needs: in many households, they were the main meat and they sold antler and skins.

One report from 1957 identifies that only nineteen percent of the land can be tilled, placing an emphasis on grazing land.

The cattle industry traces it beginnings to the first herd of long-horn cattle that arrived in Mills County in 1865, brought by J.H. Flower, which was followed shortly after by a huge herd purchased by John Williams. The yearling sale at Williams Ranch attracted buyers from Kansas or the Indian Territory. Cattle roamed the open range before settlers started fencing their land in the mid-1860s. Barbed wire arrived in 1875 and by 1879 was widely available in Texas. Land owners often fenced in areas they did not own that sometimes included public water sources for livestock, which led to a fence-cutting epidemic in the mid-1880s, leading to legislation forbidding it. A severe drought in 1886 and 1887 led to cattle and horse deaths; whole herds of cattle left the country looking for water, and their owners sometime spent days hunting for them. Some ranchers drove the herds to other parts of Texas to find water.

The cattle industry, from the beginning, has exhibited wild swings in prices in response to many factors, yet it remains a mainstay industry in Mills County. Early cattle trade in Mills County relied on the Fort Worth Stockyards for selling, but the local auction ring effected higher prices through bidding, rather than waiting to receive an offer from a buyer who came to visit a rancher&#x27;s stock. Robert Briley started the first local auction that changed hands many times to become the Mills County Livestock Commission of Goldthwaite. Later to be called the Mills County Commission Company, at one time it was the largest sheep and goat sale in the world. An industry related to livestock buying and selling was the trucking business, which started before local auctions. Early trucking, which only required a license and a railroad permit, was pioneered by Everett Holland and Lindsay Kettle from Mullin and Slim Hurst from Star.

Most of the early pioneers brought sheep when they arrived. Owners clipped wool by hand and sent the fiber by wagon train to be sold in Houston. The first local to have a sizable sheep herd was Eli Fairman, known as &quot;Sheepman&quot; Fairman. In May 1892, more than 200,000 pounds of wool shorn from Mills County sheep sold for eighteen cents a pound to a buyer in Boston and shipped by train from Goldthwaite. The first reported rail movement of mohair occurred on April 11, 1903, when a shipment of hair produced on the Elberta Ranch, located on South Bennett Creek, was sent to a processing mill in Lowell, Massachusetts. By 1910, there were 4,239 head of Angora goats in the county. Blackwell Wool and Mohair served as the main agent for warehousing and selling the fibers for most of the twentieth century. Sheep and goats are credited with improving the economy of Mills County more than cattle, largely due to stable prices and the county having optimal conditions for raising them. For years, Mills County ranked second in the state for wool and mohair production. In 1944, Texas Railroad Commissioner Ernest O. Thompson announced that Texas lead all states in wool and mohair production. The mohair industry started declining around 1970 with the introduction of polyester. In 1976, Mills County also ranked highest in the state for lamb feeding operations. More recently, meat goat production has eclipsed wool and mohair. Predator control continues to a challenge for sheep and goat populations in the county.
The first farmers in pre-Mills county used three basic tools: a walking turning plow, a walking planter, and a walking cultivator. Grain has always been a prevalent crop.By 1864, settlers started growing and harvesting cotton—the first bale of cotton was picked by W.F. Brown and ginned in Comanche. By 1910, cotton acreage had ballooned to 46,000; it was the main crop from 1887 through 1917. In 1899, &quot;The Goldthwaite Eagle&quot; published that &quot;some of the farmers [in Pleasant Grove] have plowed up their wheat and planted cotton, calculating on 4 cents per pound ... we fear as long as cotton is the principle crop at the above prices our country will remain in an embarrassed condition financially.&quot; As the land was turned over to cotton, the cattle business shifted into western Texas. Families worked together during cotton picking time to collect bales that would be taken to town to sell. World War I disrupted the economy, leading to a decline in cotton production. The war also underscored the importance of crop diversification in Mills County. By 1930, there were 32,000 acres of county land planted in cotton. Cotton acreage reached a low of 2,078 in 1959, exacerbated by the boll weevil.

In 1912, the Santa Fe Railroad published a pamphlet, &quot;Practical Information for the Farmers of Central West Texas&quot;, which provided crop and livestock recommendations that the company claimed would thrive in the county. The publication also espoused the importance of agricultural diversification.

By around 1912, most families owned a small amount of stock and farmed small grain as a necessity. At about the same time, steam threshers hit the market in Mills County. Before then, farmers relied on horse-powered threshers. Threshing, which typically started in June and ran for about four weeks, was typically part of a community effort that included neighbors who hauled the grain to the barn and women that helped cook meals. A crew consisted of an engine man, fireman, separator man, sack holders, pitchers, and grain and water wagon drivers. Steam threshing crews could be &quot;dependent&quot; or &quot;independent,&quot; which classified whether the wife of the crop&#x27;s owner supplied meals. Most of the later crews were &quot;independent,&quot; which meant they had their own cook shack. During this time, around ten threshing crews worked the summer months in Mills County. D.O. Simpson ran a threshing operation continuously from 1912 to 1938. His first machine was a J.I. Case rig that had a steam tractor and a separator. Bud Harper managed a threshing crew near Star. Combines appeared suddenly in Mills County, pushing out not only threshing machines but also reapers by 1939. &quot;The Goldthwaite Eagle&quot; published the first image of a tractor in the summer of 1915, a Case Model 10–20.

The 1920s brought prosperity to Mills County, yet booming oil business opportunities outside of Mills County caused many citizens to move for better pay. The Great Depression devastated the county, just as it did the rest of the country. It brought a general decline in Mills County farming (and overall population) and effected further agricultural diversification, leading not only to an upswing in sheep, goat, and chicken production but also to developing additional sources such as pecans, fruit, and dairy. In 1925, J.L. Corts established the first dairy about three miles southwest Goldthwaite called the &quot;Regular Dairy Farm&quot;. The first Mills County cheese factory opened in Goldthwaite in 1928. Also around this time, cold storage developed as both a stand-alone industry and also became a means to enhance other industries such as poultry. Turkey and egg production were once leading businesses in the county. Homer McCasland once had about 30,000 layers producing eggs that were distributed through a Dallas facility. Hogs were once raised county-wide for meat.

Depression relief programs provided by the U.S. Government were headquartered in the courthouse with E.B. Gilliam as administrator, yet Mills County&#x27;s needs were not as severe as other counties in Central Texas. One form of recovery that helped Mills County was the Agriculture Adjustment Act. 

By 1940, productive cropland dropped from 89,343 acres reported in 1930 to 78,372 acres as more land was used for mohair goats and sheep. The total number of farms dropped nine percent to 1,364.

The Soil Bank Program under the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s paid farmers to transform under-producing farmland to pastureland, and most of the land never returned to production. By 1959, cropland dropped to 32,000 acres, and the total number of farms dropped to 767, with a concomitant drop in population.

Starting in the 1970s and early 1980s, the county gained a number of manufacturing companies. By 1982, there were eight manufacturers employing one-hundred people, which brought a slight population increase.

Mills County is a leader in Texas pecan production. Pecans are credited as one of the most lucrative crops in the early days of Mills County, fetching about four cents per pound. In the early days, pecan crops were typically sold at markets in Houston. In 1905, one Mills County citizen reported earnings of $49.10 from a single tree. By 1929, pecan production had developed into a solid industry mostly in the southern part of the county, which became a recognized center for development of new varieties. 174,637 bushels of improved pecans were harvested in 1950, and in 1954 statistics reported 58,092 pecan trees and 385,792 pounds of pecans. Pecan harvesting as a business was accelerated by mechanization in the late 1950s, led by the invention of the pole or boom shaker by O.L. Sides and his sons, W.L. and C.N. Sides, under the auspices of their company, Metal Masters Machine, Inc. In 1958, the Sides brothers, working with Ted Burnham, developed the first drum pecan harvester, later known as the Lockwood Harvester, which used rubber picking fingers that were derived from a similar mechanism used to remove feathers from butchered poultry In 1965, the Sides contracted with Lockwood, a company that primarily worked with peanuts, to manufacture the machines. With over 800 acres of trees in the county, DeWayne McCasland has become a nationwide expert on pecans. McCasland helped organize the Texas Pecan Growers Association, a pecan marketing cooperative that originally served Texas and Oklahoma growers.

Truck farming also had its day in Mills County: one successful operation was Riverside Farm, owned by J.J. Cockrell near the Colorado River, which once had one hundred acres cultivated in a variety of fruits and a one-hundred tree pecan orchard.

Before the COVID pandemic, land in the county was selling for around $2,000 an acre and since has increased to about double that value, or more.

=== History of education ===

Early settlers taught their children the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic at home when time allowed and within the limited boundaries of what they knew. The first schools were held in the summertime under brush arbors, and teachers&#x27; meager pay was supplemented by gifts of provisions and free rent. Attendance was poor due to the long distances that students had to travel. Taught self-reliance and independence at home, lots of students defied the direction of teachers. One of the early school teachers before Mills County was Phil H. Clements, who was teaching in 1878 after moving to Williams Ranch. The concept of grades did not exist in the early days: students were classified according to reading level, e.g. second reader. Often older, advanced students were called upon to teacher their juniors.

School buildings started appearing in the 1860s and early 1870s, which were constructed by local men of logs with dirt floors, appointed with split-log benches and fireplaces, which a few years later were replaced by wood stoves. Eventually log schools evolved into lumber-based buildings as material became available. Schools usually had one room that had partitions made of panels or curtains for classrooms. Books were donated by parents. Most early schools had a tower with a bell, which rang out to announce the start of the school day. Most also had a stage with a curtain made of advertising squares promoting local merchants, along with artistic embellishments, which was a source of community pride. State support of pre-Mills County schools was minimal in the early days: for instance, Williams Ranch received ninety-nine dollars in 1878. Students brought simple lunches in lard buckets, usually consisting of leftover bisquits. In the early days, only Goldthwaite, Mullin, Priddy, and Star offered high school diplomas.

An important order of business at the first meeting of the Mills County Commissioner&#x27;s Court on October 12, 1887, was to incorporate schools that existed at the time into the a new county educational system, including establishing local school taxes. 

In 1900, Mr. and Mrs. T.W. Hatcher organized the Mills County Institute, also known as Hatcher University, in Goldthwaite on Fisher Street. It closed in 1907.

In 1907, the &quot;Self Culture Club&quot; opened the first community library in the M.L. Brown Drug Store. Miss Alline Howell, a teacher at the Rye Valley School, gathered community support to open the first county school library in 1915. Its first collection of books were purchased as a lot from &quot;Farm and Ranch Magazine&quot;.

By 1910, there were fifty-two public schools in Mills County with sixty-five teachers, and by 1976, there were eighty-one schools.

During the 1930s, with teachers desperate for jobs, school boards were able to make strenuous demands of teachers, often requiring them to live in the community where they taught, agree to leave the community only one weekend per month, participate in various community events, and sometimes agree to not marry.

The Star School building, erected in 1940, is the only school in the county to be built by the W.P.A.

Today Mills County has four consolidated schools: Goldthwaite, Mullin, and Priddy [source included Star, which consolidated with Goldthwaite Consolidated ISD on July 1, 2014].

== Recreation ==
The early county residents enjoyed a number of diversions, including dancing, attending movies, running horse races, going to town on Saturdays, and drinking at the saloons. The first Mills County fairgrounds, located on the south side of Goldthwaite to the east of Livestock Commission Company, had a number of features, including a race track, baseball and football fields, an exhibition building, a band and dance platform, and sometimes a skating rink. It also hosted a carnival. All Goldthwaite football games were held at the football field at the fairgrounds—without bleachers–until a stadium was built near the school in the late 1930s. The circus, hosted in Goldthwaite, also attracted residents from across the county. Another regular diversion for county residents were medicine shows, held in Goldthwaite, in which proprietors put on an entertaining show designed to sell nostrums. In the 1920s, Lake Merrit attracted many Mills County residents, who camped and swam there.

Goldthwaite is home to the Texas State Championship BBQ &amp; Goat Cook-off, which was started in 1996.

An abundance of deer, dove, hogs, turkey, and small game attracts recreational hunters from Texas and beyond. Fishing is also a popular activity in the county.

The annual Mills County Youth Fair &amp; Stock Show, a collaboration of FFA, FHA, and 4-H chapters from across the county, has been in operation for over 80 years. Mills County Extension Agent Tom Guthrie observed, &quot;I think this is probably the largest single event in the county that brings kids and adults from all over Mills County together.

The Goldthwaite Theatre, established in 2017, occupies a historic property in downtown Goldthwaite that was once an opera house in the late nineteenth century. The building is owned by the city&#x27;s Economic Development Corporation.

== Politics ==










In a groundbreaking political study published in 1964, Mills County was identified as being entrenched in liberalism with voters overwhelmingly supporting Democratic politicians, owing to the county&#x27;s southern heritage of liberal populism and single-party politics. In 2010, &quot;The Goldthwaite Eagle&quot; reported the county&#x27;s dramatic shift to the Republican party following a long history of landslide Democratic voting in local elections.

Votes cast at the county&#x27;s general election for November 8, 2022, showed a 90% Republican and 10% Democratic split.

=== Historical notes ===
The Populist Party was at its height in Mills County towards the end of the nineteenth century.

A prohibition movement starting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to a ban on alcohol in the Goldthwaite School District; in 1908, liquor ban went into effect for the whole county. A local option election held on November 8, 2016, lifted the ban on alcohol sales within the Goldthwaite city limits (357 votes for and 277 against).

A special buffalo bar-b-que organized by a number of local businessman in 1948 welcomed Lyndon B. Johnson, who arrived by helicopter and delivered a speech to a crowd of 2,500 at the baseball field near Lampasas Commission Company.

==Media==

The first known newspaper, preceding the formation of Mills County, was the &quot;Rancho Rackett&quot;, which started around 1880 at Williams Ranch. A broadside appeared in Goldthwaite, printed on a portable press by Lampasas resident &quot;Calamity&quot; Bonner, and is credited as the first paper distributed in the town. &quot;The Goldthwaite Mountaineer&quot; was published by W.H. Thompson starting on March 5, 1886, before ending publication in 1898 under Col. J.K. Street and merging with the &quot;Brownwood Record&quot;. Col. Street, after publishing &quot;The Goldthwaite Mountaineer&quot; for about three months, determined that the town could not sustain two newspapers. The first profitable weekly newspaper, &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot;, was established by W.H. Thompson and R.M. Thompson in 1894. An early issue of the paper identifies itself as &quot;the organ of Mills County.&quot; The same year a weekly called &quot;The Mills County Advocate&quot; commenced publication. In 1896, &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; was sold, and its name changed to &quot;The Goldthwaite Eagle&quot;. &quot;The Mullin Enterprise&quot;, which began in 1902, merged with &quot;The Eagle&quot; in 1950.

Mills County is part of the Waco/Temple/Killeen (Central Texas) DMA. Local media outlets include: KCEN-TV, KWTX-TV, KXXV-TV, KWKT-TV and KNCT-TV. Two other television stations from the Abilene/Sweetwater/Brownwood DMA provide coverage for Mills County, KTAB-TV and KRBC-TV. KRNR FM 92.7, &quot;Redneck Radio,&quot; currently broadcasts from Goldthwaite. During the 1920s, a radio station owned by the Eagle Publishing Company, KGKB (frequency 1070 KC), broadcast from &quot;The Goldthwaite Eagle&quot; editorial offices before moving to Brownwood.

== Transportation ==
Pioneers traveled through pre-Mills County by wagon pulled by ox, mule, or horse teams on primitive clearings through wooded areas or via crude trails that were often nearly impassable in wet conditions due to mud holes. Rivers were forded, but some waterways had log bridges. They went to Waco or Houston for supplies—a round trip to Waco took seven to ten days. Freight wagons moved the same way loaded with hogs, wood, hides, pelts, and pecans to be traded for supplies, and they were sometimes followed by a herd of cattle.

Today the county maintains approximately 445 miles of county roads.

In 1901, before the Texas Highway Department was formed, county roads were maintained via a $3.00-per-person tax, known as the &quot;road tax.&quot; Instead of paying the tax, a person could work three days a week on the road or hire someone else to take his place.

=== Railroad ===
The railroad had a profound impact on the development of the county. In 1885, the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railroad laid tracks through Goldthwaite, Pegtown, and Mullin, then onto Brownwood, bypassing Williams Ranch and Center City, both of which had anticipated being stops. The primary impetus for the railroad to pass through the county was to reach San Angelo livestock markets.

The railroad created Goldthwaite and Mullin, similar to about twenty other townsites the railroad platted and auctioned along its path. On September 2, 1885, two years before Mills County formed, a GC&amp;SFR train made a stop at Goldthwaite (then in Brown County), and on that day Thos. W. Jackson, Santa Fe Land Commissioner, begin auctioning lots that would be the foundation of the town. On December 31, 1885, regular train service began in Goldthwaite, with the town serving as a division point. By 1886, the railroad was the largest employer in the county, with thirty-six in its workforce. In 1905, the railroad boosted land ownership and farming in Mills County by offering employees the option to purchase land along its tracks through payroll deductions.

===Major highways===
* U.S. Highway 84
* U.S. Highway 183
* State Highway 16

=== Mail ===
Before the postal service arrived in pre-Mills County in the late 1870s, mail was carried by travelers or cowboys from San Saba. The earliest known postmaster in the area was James D. Williams at Williams Ranch, who was appointed on January 16, 1877. Miss Dera Humphries is recognized as first woman mail carrier in Mills County, serving from 1921 to 1941.
== Significant structures ==
Mills County&#x27;s first courthouse, officially recognized on June 25, 1890, was built by John Cormack of Lampasas and paid by bonds amounting to $27,500. On May 5, 1912, the courthouse burned, allegedly by arson. After the fire, a controversy erupted over whether the replacement courthouse should be built in Goldthwaite or Mullin, some arguing that Mullin was closer to the center of the county and should be named the new county seat. The Texas Land Commissioner located the center of the county, closer to Goldthwaite, and marked it with a bronze marker designated &quot;Center Point.&quot; Goldthwaite would remain the county seat. Later that year, the county hired Henry T. Phelps to design and specify a new courthouse, and construction was completed by the Gordon-Jones Construction Company on November 17, 1913, at a cost of around $69,000. The classical revival courthouse was recently renovated through a grant from the Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program. In 1915 during Jim Crow, a Confederate Memorial Monument was placed on the courthouse grounds in Goldthwaite, funded by public donations, the civic organization Self Culture Club, Jeff Davis Camp 117, and the United Confederate Veterans.

Called the &quot;Goldthwaite Calaboose,&quot; the first jail in Mills County was ordered to be built in 1887 at a cost of $15.00. It was an eight-foot square building made of 2&quot; x 12&quot; lumber that was located on the south side of the courthouse square. On October 12, 1887, county judge J.B. Head began to take bids for building a new jail. The limestone jail that still stands was built by Green and Nichols of Lampasas at a cost of $8,850; it was completed in April 1888, six months and nine days following ground breaking. J.B. Dumas, the designer, specified that the upper floor contain prisoner cells and the bottom floor accommodate sheriff&#x27;s offices. Diebold Safe and Lock Company made the cells and ironwork. It served as the county jail until the 1950s and was in use until 1977. In 1965, it received a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark designation and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

==Politics==
Midland County was one of the first areas of Texas to turn Republican, beginning with native son Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign for the presidency in 1952. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win the county was Harry Truman in 1948. Even in the presidential election of 1964 in which the incumbent president, Texan Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson, won a national landslide victory, it gave 57.8% of its ballots to Republican presidential candidate and Arizona native Barry Goldwater. This is the last time a Democrat managed 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and one of only two since 1948 that a Democrat has won even 30 percent of the vote. Despite this, conservative Democrats held most local offices well into the 1980s.

Midland County is located in Texas&#x27;s 11th congressional district, represented by Republican August Pfluger. The 11th Congressional District gave George W. Bush 78% of its votes in 2004, higher than any other congressional district in the nation.

<text>Menard County is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,962. The county seat is Menard. The county was created in 1858 and later organized in 1871. It is named for Michel Branamour Menard, the founder of Galveston, Texas.

==History==

Around 8000 BC, Native American inhabitants arrived. Later Native Americans included Comanche and Lipan Apache. In 1757, Father Alonso Giraldo de Terreros founded Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, as a support for Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission, for the Apache Indians.
In the 1830s, James Bowie and Rezin P. Bowie scoured the San Saba valley seeking a silver mine that the Spanish had believed to be in the area. They were unsuccessful, but the legend of the Lost Bowie Mine, also known as the Lost San Saba Mine or the Los Almagres Mine, fed the imaginations of treasure-seekers for the next 150 years.

Camp San Saba was established in 1852 to protect settlers from Indian attacks. The state legislature formed Menard County from Bexar County in 1858. The county was named for Michel Branamour Menard, the founder of Galveston. Menardville, later known as Menard, became the county seat.

By 1870, the county population was 667: 295 were white, and 372 were black, possibly due to the Buffalo Soldiers at Fort McKavett.
The next year, county residents elected their own officials. The county had an immigrant influx from Mexico.
In 1911, the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railroad Company arrived.
Gas deposits were tapped in 1929, but plugged for lack of a market.
The local Parent-Teacher Association offered free lunches for needy children in 1931.

In 1934, the Texas Relief Cannery was in operation. The Drought Relief Program bought cattle and sheep from area ranchers. A gas well was redrilled in 1941, and produced about seven million cubic feet of gas. In 1946, a small oilfield was discovered northeast of Fort McKavett, but was abandoned the following year.
By the 1960s, oil and gas production had an average annual yield more than . In the 1980s, of the county&#x27;s 40 oilfields, about 20 were still active, producing 132,000 to annually.

<doc id="91499" wikidata="Q110421" url="?curid=91499" title="Medina County, Texas">
<text>Medina County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 50,748. Its county seat is Hondo. The county is named for the Medina River. The extreme northern part of the county lies within the Edwards Plateau, which elevates into the Texas Hill Country. The Medina Dam, the fourth largest in the nation when completed in 1913, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The irrigation project, creating Medina Lake, was built by 1500 skilled workers who worked in shifts operating 24 hours a day to complete the dam in two years. Medina County is part of the San Antonio, TX Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The county is named after the Medina River, which was named in 1689 after the Spanish cartographer Pedro de Medina by the Spanish explorer Alonso de Leon, the first European to encounter the river. Because Pedro de Medina derived his surname from the Andalusian city of Medina-Sidonia, the name Medina comes from the Arabic for city.

The Texas Legislature formed Medina county on February 12, 1848, and enlarged it on February 1, 1850, using land taken from Bexar County. Castroville was the county seat, and the county erected the first permanent courthouse there in 1854. The county seat moved to Hondo in 1892, and a new courthouse was completed there in 1893.

=== Texas-Indian Wars ===
The county was home to tribes such as the Lipan Apache, Coahuiltecan, and Tonkawa.

The county was subject to frequent Comanche and Kiowa raids during the 1860s and 1870s. On a June 11, 1873 raid, Comanches attacked four settlers near Hondo. These raids were feared by the local residents, however by 1875, the raiding had stopped. However, although the Comanche were gone, there were still other tribes raiding the county very frequently.

The last Indian raid of the county happened on April 22, 1877, when 19 year old Joe Wilton was killed by Indians near Devine, Texas.

<text>McLennan County is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in Central Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 260,579. Its county seat and largest city is Waco. The U.S. census 2023 county population estimate is 268,583. The county is named for Neil McLennan, an early Scottish settler who worked to evict the Native Americans in frontier Texas.

==History==

McLennan County was created by the Texas Legislature in 1850 out of Milam County. The county seat, Waco, had been founded as an outpost of the Texas Rangers. It was laid out by George B. Erath, and was known by 1850 as Waco Village.

In the 1880s, pharmacist Charles Alderton developed the carbonated beverage that became known as Dr Pepper. The Dr Pepper business was headquartered in Waco, until it moved to Dallas, Texas. Waco is also home to the Dr Pepper Museum, housed in the 1906 building that was the first stand-alone facility used to bottle Dr Pepper.

According to local lore, the first sustained flight did not occur in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, but just outside Tokio (a small community in McLennan County) by a man flying a gyrocopter. During World War I, McLennan County was home to at least one military airfield, Rich Field. In the aftermath of World War I, when social tensions were high as veterans returned, white racial violence broke out against blacks. The county had 15 lynchings, the second-highest number of any county in the state.

McLennan County&#x27;s contributions to World War II include the reopening of Rich Field for use by the Air Force, and the opening of James Connally Air Force Base. The latter is now used as the TSTC Waco Airport and Texas State Technical College. County resident Doris Miller was awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism at Pearl Harbor; he was the first African American to earn such distinction. Local man James Connally became known as a World War II fighter pilot.

===County Courthouse===
The current County Courthouse, the fourth to be built, is located in Waco. Completed in 1902 in the Beaux-Arts style, it is the next-to-last example of architect James Riely Gordon&#x27;s Texas courthouses. Of the eighteen he designed, thirteen remain standing. The first county courthouse was completed in 1851 for $500, and was a two-story log cabin that was 30&#x27; x 30&#x27;. McLennan&#x27;s second courthouse was a two-story brick building completed in 1857 for $11,000. The third courthouse was styled after Second Empire by architect W.C. Dodson, and completed in 1877 at a cost of $24,894.50.
===Institutions of higher education===
In 1886, Baylor University relocated from Independence, Texas, to Waco and absorbed Waco University. During the early 20th century, McLennan County was home to as many as five colleges. In addition to Baylor, the other colleges included the predecessor to what is now known as Texas Christian University (now in Fort Worth), Paul Quinn College (relocated since to Dallas), and two other short-lived colleges.

In the 1960s, the Texas Legislature authorized McLennan Community College, the first community college to use those words in the name. Around the same time, what is now the flagship institution of Texas State Technical College was founded as James Connally Technical Institute, as a member of the Texas A&amp;M University System. Today, Baylor, McLennan Community College, and Texas State Technical College continue to operate in McLennan County. They educate a large portion of the college-bound high-school graduates from the county and the surrounding areas. McLennan Community College has also partnered with Tarleton State University, Texas Tech University, University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and Midwestern State University to offer more than 50 bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees.

===1896 Crash at Crush===
Crush, Texas, was a temporary &quot;city&quot; in McLennan County, about north of Waco. It was established to stage a publicity stunt concocted by William George Crush and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The stunt involved the collision of two 35-ton steam locomotives in front of spectators, whom the railway transported to the event for $2 each. After strong promotion, on September 15, 1896, the event was delayed by an hour as the police maneuvered the crowd of more than 40,000 back to what was thought to be a safe distance.

The crews of the two engines tied the throttles open and jumped off. The two engines, pulling wagons filled with railroad ties, traveled a track and thunderously crashed into each other at a combined speed up to . The boilers exploded and sent steam and flying debris into the crowd. Three people were killed and about six were injured, including event photographer Jarvis &quot;Joe&quot; Deane, who lost an eye because of a flying bolt.

Ragtime composer Scott Joplin commemorated the event with &quot;The Great Crush Collision March&quot;; Joplin dedicated the composition to the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railway. Texas composer and singer Brian Burns wrote and recorded a song about the collision, &quot;The Crash at Crush&quot; (2001).

=== West fertilizer plant explosion ===
===Waco siege===
===Twin Peaks biker shootout===

On May 17, 2015, motorcycle clubs gathered at the Twin Peaks Restaurant in Waco for a Confederation of Clubs meeting. Upon arrival of a large contingent of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club, mass violence erupted in the parking lot of Twin Peaks between members of the Bandidos and members of the Cossasks Motorcycle Club. This resulted in nine dead and 18 wounded in the melee between the rival outlaw motorcycle gangs. In 2019, all remaining charges were dropped by the new District Attorney, Barry Johnson.

<text>Maverick County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 57,887. Its county seat is Eagle Pass. The county was created in 1856 and organized in 1871. It is named for Samuel Maverick, cattleman and state legislator.

The Eagle Pass, TX Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Maverick County. It is east of the Mexican border.

==History==
===Native Americans===

Prehistoric hunter-gatherer peoples were the first inhabitants, and their artifacts have been found in various areas of the county. Lipan Apache, Shawnee, and Coahuiltecan culture followed. The abandonment of Fort Duncan on March 20, 1861, during the Civil War, enabled the Indian population to gain control of the region; both American and Mexican inhabitants suffered tremendous loss of life and property. The fort was reoccupied in 1868. In early 1871, a number of Black Seminole Indians living along the border were organized into a company of scouts and brought to Fort Duncan.
The last Indian raid in the county occurred in 1877. Three traders were murdered and mutilated by Lipan Apaches. The site of the incident, northeast of Eagle Pass, became known as Deadman&#x27;s Hill.

===Spanish explorations===

The El Camino Real, later known as the Old San Antonio Road, that crosses the Rio Grande, begins in East Texas and crosses southern Maverick County. The trail was originally blazed by Alonso De León in 1690, and is said to have been traversed by more early Spanish explorers and settlers than any other section of the state. In 1989, the legislature authorized the Old San Antonio Road Preservation Commission to coordinate the 1991 300th anniversary of the trail&#x27;s founding.

Saltillo alcade Fernando de Azcué in 1665 pursued Indians into the county. In 1675, Fernando del Bosque traversed the area near Quemado, and Franciscans with the expedition are said to have celebrated the first Mass on Texas soil.
In 1688, Alonso De León followed the Camino Real across the county en route to Fort St. Louis. Domingo Terán de los Ríos, the first Governor of Spanish Texas, led an expedition through the county in 1691. Spanish Texas Governor Martín de Alarcón crossed the county in 1718 on the expedition that resulted in the founding of San Antonio.
Governor of the Mexican provinces of Coahuila and Texas, Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo, in 1720 passed through on an expedition that brought goats, 2800 horses and 6400 sheep that was the onset of Spanish ranching in Texas. Pedro de Rivera y Villalón crossed the county in 1727 as part of an expedition to inspect the frontier defenses of New Spain.

===Early settlers===

Antonio Rivas was the first known rancher on the land in 1765. The county still has a considerable ranching community.

On March 27, 1849, Capt. Sidney Burbank established Fort Duncan, previously known as Camp Eagle Pass, on a site north of the ford at Adjuntos Pass.

General William Leslie Cazneau, credited several years earlier with burying the Alamo casualties with full military honors, began ranching in the area around 1850. He partnered with Irish-born San Antonio banker and county settler John Twohig to lay out a plan of Eagle Pass in 1850. That same year, a Mexican garrison established Piedras Negras across the border.

Freight operator Friedrich Wilhelm Carl Groos secured a contract to haul supplies for the army at Fort Duncan. At his urging, several early settlers of Eagle Pass were &quot;emigres&quot; of the Mexican river villages and missions of San Juan Bautista, San José, Santo Domingo, San Nicolás, La Navaja, and San Isidro.

&quot;Emigres&quot; Refugio and Rita Alderete de San Miguel used the profits of their freighting business to establish a large-scale cattle, sheep, and horse ranch on Elm Creek in 1853. They were joined in ranching operations by stranded pilgrims on the California Gold Rush trail and discharged Fort Duncan soldiers. Among these was Infantry veteran Jesse Sumpter, who also worked at many odd jobs before becoming sheriff in the newly formed Maverick County.

Landscape pioneer Frederick Law Olmsted visited Eagle Pass in 1854, and noted the many slave hunters and runaway slaves residing in Piedras Negras, as well as the many saloons and gambling houses, which catered to Fort Duncan&#x27;s soldiers and other unsavory characters.

In 1855, Texas Governor Elisha M. Pease authorized a raid into Mexico. An international incident was brought about by James H. Callahan and William R. Henry, whose pursuit of Lipan Apache raiders and runaway slaves into Mexico ended in the looting and torching of Piedras Negras, after an encounter with Mexican forces at La Marama on the Río Escondido.

===County established and growth===

Maverick County was established from Kinney County and named for Samuel A. Maverick in 1856. The county was organized some years later on September 4, 1871. The estimated population of the county in 1860 was 726. Eagle Pass voted 83–3 against secession from the Union.

Fort Duncan was occupied by Confederate troops during the Civil War. Eagle Pass was chosen as a trade depot for the Military Board of Texas. Eagle Pass was a major terminus of the Cotton Road, custom house and Confederate port of entry into Mexico 1863–65. A cotton press was installed at Piedras Negras to handle the enormous quantities coming across the Rio Grande. At the close of the Civil War, General Joseph Orville Shelby&#x27;s brigade never surrendered, but hoped to continue their fight across the border. On July 4, 1865, Shelby stopped in the middle of the Rio Grande to bury the last Confederate flag to fly over his troops. To the sound of drum and bugle, he wrapped the flag around the plume of his hat, weighted it with a stone from the river bank, and lowered it into the river. Shelby&#x27;s unit became known as “The Undefeated” and was used as a basis for the 1969 John Wayne-Rock Hudson film by the same name.

Saloons, gambling houses, and smuggling operations proliferated in and around Eagle Pass during Reconstruction. The infamous J. King Fisher and his followers dominated the era in the region.

Telegraph lines reached Eagle Pass in 1875. In 1880, the main line of the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway was extended west from San Antonio, connecting to the Mexican Railway in Piedras Negras.

Irrigation has been vital to area farmers. In 1885, rancher Patrick W. Thomson formed the Eagle Pass Irrigation Company to construct a huge gravity-flow irrigation system to draw water from the Rio Grande. Thompson died in 1910, but his efforts came to fruition as the Maverick County Irrigation Canal system, operational by April 1932.

March 3, 1911, when Lt. Benjamin D. Foulois and Philip O. Parmalee made the first official military reconnaissance flight, looking for Army troops between Laredo and Eagle Pass, Texas, with a ground exercise in progress. In 1942, the Army Air Force built a single-engine advanced flying school north of Eagle Pass.

Oil and gas exploration in the county began in the 1950s, with the largest fields being the 1969 Fitzpatrick and Wipff, and the 1970 Burr.

The coal industry of Maverick County is located along a section of the Olmos Coal Formation immediately north of Eagle Pass. Mining operations developed by Dolch at Dolchburg and by the Olmos Coal, Coke, and Oil Company at Olmos were the largest coal producers in Texas around the turn of the 20th century.

Industries located in the county in 1977 included a cotton gin and two cattle feedlots with capacities of 25,000 cattle at El Indio, one at Normandy, and another between Eagle Pass and El Indio. A spinach-packing shed was at the southern edge of Eagle Pass. Industries which have located in the Eagle Pass–Maverick County area since 1977 include the Eagle Pass Manufacturing Company (a division of Hicks-Ponder, Inc) and the Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Co, both makers of work clothing; the Reynolds Mining Corp fluorspar plant and the Tejas Barite plant; Alta-Verde Industries and Maverick Beef Producers, and the Big River Catfish Farm.

In 1982, 88 percent of all land in the county was considered farmland and ranches, but only 2 percent of the farmland was under cultivation, and most of that was irrigated. Primary crops were hay, oats, and wheat.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.

== Politics ==
Like most of heavily Hispanic South Texas, Maverick County has leaned towards the Democratic Party. In 1972, Maverick County was one of only eight counties in Texas where George McGovern received a majority of the vote. The county held a very long Democratic streak; until 2024, the last Republican to carry the county was Herbert Hoover in 1928. In recent times it cast a majority of its votes for U.S. Senator John Kerry in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. President George W. Bush received 4,025 votes to Kerry&#x27;s 5,948. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election it cast a higher majority of 8,554 votes for Barack Obama. In 2020, however, Maverick County joined the rest of South Texas in swinging heavily towards the Republican Party. President Donald Trump managed to put up nearly 45% of the vote and narrow the margin to less than 10%, the Republican Party&#x27;s best result in the county since President Richard Nixon&#x27;s landslide victory in 1972. The 2024 election continued this trend, in which the county flipped Republican by a large margin, casting nearly 59% of its vote for Trump. Maverick had the largest shift to Trump out of any county in the country in the 2024 election.











The county is located in Texas Senate, District 19 so is represented by Democrat Roland Gutierrez in the Texas Senate. As part of the 74th district of the Texas House of Representatives it is represented by Democrat Eddie Morales. In the United States House of Representatives it is part of Texas&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, which has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+1 and is represented by Republican Tony Gonzales.

<text>Marion County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 9,725. Its county seat is Jefferson. Marion County is in East Texas and is named for Francis Marion, the Revolutionary War general from South Carolina who was nicknamed the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot;.

==History==

===Native Americans===

The indigenous farming Caddoan Mississippian culture has been dated to 200 BCE in the area. The Hernando de Soto expedition of 1541 resulted in violent encounters with Native Americans. Spanish and French missionaries carried endemic diseases: resulting in epidemics of smallpox, measles malaria, and influenza among the Caddo. Eventually, the Caddo were forced to reservations. Shashidahnee (Timber Hill) is the last known permanent Marion County settlement of the Caddo people. During the 19th century, Shawnee, Delaware, and Kickapoo migrated to the area and settled here.

===County established===

The legislature formed Marion County from Cass County in 1860 and named it for Revolutionary War Swamp Fox Francis Marion. Jefferson, named after Thomas Jefferson became the county seat.

The majority of the settlers had migrated from other southern states and brought enslaved African Americans with them as workers, or purchased them in slave markets. The county was developed as cotton plantations, and enslaved African Americans made up 51 percent of the population in 1860. In 1861, the white male voters in the county voted unanimously for secession from the Union. The county benefited financially from Confederate government contracts.

In February 1869 the river steamboat &quot;Mittie Stephens&quot; caught fire from a torch basket that ignited a hay stack on board. Sixty-one people died, either from the fire or from being caught in the boat&#x27;s paddlewheel as they jumped overboard.

Following the Civil War, the white minority used violence to impose dominance on the freedmen. On October 4, 1869, George Washington Smith, a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention, was murdered by a band of vigilantes while incarcerated in Jefferson. Smith&#x27;s slaying resulted in the federal government assigning military troops to Jefferson. They offered some protection for the black majority during the Reconstruction era.

During Reconstruction, Republican presidential races were supported by the black majority voters in the county. However, with the end of Reconstruction, white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature and, in 1898, passed various restrictions on voter registration and voting, including establishing White primaries. Because the Democratic Party dominated the state, its primaries afforded the only true competitive political races. Blacks were unable to vote in these primaries and were thus disenfranchised. Various forms of the white primary survived until 1944 when a US Supreme Court ruling overturned the practice as racially discriminatory and unconstitutional.

The Marion County brick courthouse was erected in 1914, designed by architect Elmer George Withers. In the early 20th century, the Dick Taylor Camp of Confederate veterans erected a monument to honor the county&#x27;s dead in the American Civil War, placing it outside the courthouse.

Caddo Lake State Park was first proposed in 1924. From 1933 to 1937, during the Great Depression, men were hired into the Civilian Conservation Corps and made improvements to the park. The former army barracks and mess hall were converted to log cabins and a recreation hall for park goers.

<text>Lynn County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,596. Its county seat is Tahoka. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1903.

Lynn County, along with Crosby and Lubbock Counties, is part of the Lubbock Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The Lubbock MSA and Levelland Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA), encompassing only Hockley County, form the larger Lubbock–Levelland Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

Lynn County was one of 30 prohibition, or entirely dry, counties in Texas, but is now a moist county.

The county has two historical museums, the O&#x27;Donnell Heritage Museum, with a Dan Blocker room in O&#x27;Donnell, and the Tahoka Pioneer Museum in Tahoka.

The county is also home to the Lynn County Hospital District that provides medical care to the county and surrounding area.

==History==

===Native Americans===

Apache and Comanche peoples roamed the high plains until various military expeditions of the 19th century pushed them away.

The Red River War of 1874 was a military campaign to drive out the Apaches, Comanches, and Kiowas in Texas. In 1877, the ill-fated Nolan Expedition crossed the county in search of livestock stolen by Comanche renegades.
The various Indian tribes had moved on by the time of white settlement due to the depletion of the buffalo herds by hunters.

===Settlers===

In the early 1880s, sheep and cattle ranchers began to set up operations in the county. The situation changed as large-scale ranching spread into the county.

W C. Young of Fort Worth and Illinois Irishman Ben Galbraith established the beginnings of the Curry Comb Ranch in the northwest part of Garza County. By 1880, it spilled over into Lynn County. The Square Compass Ranch of Garza County also protruded into Lynn County.

The county remained sparsely settled ranching territory for two decades after 1880. It had no towns; the population was nine in 1880, 24 in 1890, and 17 in 1900. Farmers began to move into the county and invest in corn, grains, and cotton.

===County established===

Lynn County was formed in 1876 from Bexar. The county was organized in 1903, with Tahoka becoming the county seat.

New towns were founded during the early years of the 20th century. O&#x27;Donnell, named for railroad man Tom J. O&#x27;Donnell, was established in 1910 as a speculative venture based on the opening up of new farmlands in southern Lynn and northern Dawson Counties. Wilson, northeast of Tahoka, was established in 1912 to attract farmers to the newly opened lands of the Dixie Ranch. A large number of Central Texas Germans purchased county lands, thus beginning a small-scale migration of Germans into the county that lasted into the 1950s.

Cotton farming prospered in the early part of the 20th century. Farmers later expanded to wheat and sorghum, plus cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry, chiefly chickens and turkeys.

Oil was discovered in the county in 1950. By 1983, the total production was .

== Elected leadership ==


==Politics==
At the presidential level, Lubbock County votes predominantly Republican, having voted Democratic for president only once in the past 70 years, a trend which began with native son Dwight D. Eisenhower heading the ticket in 1952 and 1956, reversing a trend typical of the Solid South. In the 2020 Presidential election, Joe Biden&#x27;s percentage (a best for a Democrat since 1976), was due to Biden winning precincts within the city highway loop in Lubbock. The heavy Republican lean of the county is mostly due to Republican landslide victories in precincts located outside the city highway loop in the county.

In October 2023, Lubbock County Commissioners passed a &quot;Sanctuary County for the Unborn&quot; ordinance. The ordinance outlaws &quot;the act of transporting another person along their roads for an abortion.&quot; The ordinance is of questionable constitutionality, given the right to interstate travel under the U.S. Constitution.

<text>Loving County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. With a population of 64 according to the 2020 census, it is the least populous county in the United States with a permanent population. Its county seat and only community is Mentone. 

Loving County was originally split off of Reeves County in 1887. It was merged back into Reeves County ten years later, and was reorganized in 1931. It is located in West Texas, just south of the New Mexico state border. Reeves County is to its south and west, Ward County is to its south, and Winkler County is to its east.

==History==
Nomadic hunters inhabited the area during prehistory. Antonio de Espejo traveled in the area in 1583, and crossed the Pecos River. Immigrants used a ford, later named Pope&#x27;s Crossing, for travel in the 1840s. John Pope surveyed the area in 1854, for the building of a transcontinental railroad. He created a camp in 1855, and conducted three drilling attempts, but only found water once and was unable to access it. Andrew A. Humphreys ordered Pope to end his drilling and abandon the camp on July 10, 1858. Soldiers were stationed at the camp created by Pope from 1858 to 1861. The route of the Butterfield Overland Mail went through the area.

Oliver Loving, after whom the county was named, and Charles Goodnight drove cattle through the area in 1866, creating the Goodnight–Loving Trail. Loving was shot by a Comanche native in 1867, and died from gangrene. The area was a part of Bexar County from 1837 to 1874, when it became a part of Tom Green County. Eleven people in the area, including Clay Allison, petitioned to the 19th session of the Texas Legislature to become a part of Reeves County. Loving County was created in 1887, by House Bill No. 113, although it was to be attached to Reeves County for certain purposes, including judicial and surveying.

Six men from Denver came to the county in 1893, and founded the Loving Canal and Irrigation Company and Mentone, which was named by a French surveyor for his home of Menton, France. On June 13, the men filed a petition with 150 signatures to the Reeves County Commissioners Court requesting the organization of the county and it was accepted. The county organization was approved by an election held on July 8, with 83 voters participating, and Mentone became the county seat. Another election was held in 1894, and both elections held in the county are believed to have been fraudulent. The county commission issued bonds worth $6,000 to construct a courthouse in Mentone, but the project was not completed as a flood in August destroyed the work that was done on the irrigation project. Accusations of illegal county organization arose, which were investigated by H. C. Withers and A. H. Randolph. They were informed by W. A. Hunter, the sheriff and tax collector, that R. G. Munn, the county clerk, had taken the tax records to Denver. All of the county officials had left the county by 1897, and the county was dissolved on May 12, 1897, and returned to Reeves County.

In December 1896, Hunter traveled to Pecos, Texas, but went missing with his horses either dying from starvation or being unaccounted for. His sister, Jennie M. Mettler, attempted to receive the $15,000 in life insurance that Hunter took out in November, but the insurance company refused to pay, as Hunter&#x27;s body was not discovered. She filed a lawsuit and won in the first case and in the appeal made by the company to the Supreme Court of the United States. Hunter was found living in Birmingham, Alabama, under the name of Al Hunt in 1902. He had abandoned one of his horses, while riding the other one, to take a train from Barstow, Texas. He was sentenced to serve five years in prison, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.

The county has no cemetery, and the only grave in the area is for Shady Davis, a 21-year-old cowboy who was killed by his horse and buried 12 miles from Mentone in the 1920s. The population in the area increased following the discovery of oil, and led to the creation of the town of Ramsey. Loving County was reorganized in 1931, becoming the only county in Texas to be organized twice, and Ramsey was later renamed as Mentone.

On November 17, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Loving County was the last county in the contiguous United States to confirm at least one case of COVID-19, with three cases confirmed in the area. Earlier in August, a nonresident male at a man camp was confirmed to have contracted it. Additionally, at least two residents who had contracted it elsewhere returned to Loving County and quarantined, but those cases were not counted in the county&#x27;s totals.

==Geography==
The county is three-fifths the size of Rhode Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (1.1%) are covered by water.

Water in the area has to be imported from Kermit or Pecos, Texas, due to the groundwater in the area containing gypsum; the Pecos River was previously used for water before its salinity became too high. The Pecos River is the county&#x27;s western boundary, forming the Red Bluff Reservoir along its northwestern border with Reeves County and Eddy County, New Mexico. The terrain of Loving County is described as flat desert, with a few low hills. Desert shrubs, range grasses, and cacti abound, with salt cedars along the river. Elevations vary from above sea level.

Loving is the smallest county by area in the Permian Basin region.

==Politics and government==










Since the 1988 election, early voting has accounted for at least 13.11% of votes in the county, with early voting accounting for a majority of the votes in the 1994 election with 53.54%, 1998 election with 50%, 2000 election with 74.36%, 2006 election with 58.89%, and 2020 election with 68.18%. The lowest voter turnout since the 1988 election was in the 2018 election with 49% and the highest in the 1990 election with 85.71%. The county had the highest voter turnout in Texas in the 1986 election. At some points in the county&#x27;s history, the county had more registered voters than residents and precincts closed early to deny people the ability to vote.

J. J. Combs was appointed as county judge by the county commission on September 6, 1893. Edna Reed Clayton DeWees served as sheriff in the county from 1946 to 1948, making her the first woman to be elected as a sheriff in Texas.

The county judge is the highest elected official in the county and the position has been held by Skeet Jones since 2007. The Creager family once had family members who served as county judge, postmaster, sheriff, tax assessor, and county commission member. The Joneses are a political family in the county with members of the family controlling the positions of judge, clerk, attorney, and constable. The Jones family is a ranching family who moved to the county when Elgin &quot;Punk&quot; Jones and Mary Belle Jones built their ranch in 1953. Punk served as the sheriff for 28 years and Mary Belle served as the chief appraiser. The top elected official of Loving County, Judge Skeet Jones, and three other individuals were arrested in 2022 for stealing livestock.

In 2022, Sheriff Chris Busse reported that a ranch with 11 registered voters, including county commissioner Ysidro Renteria, had no inhabitants since 2008.

Loving was one of only four counties in Texas to give a plurality of the vote to independent presidential candidate Ross Perot in 1992.

==Economy==
Three cattle businesses were in the county in 1887, with 12,100 cattle worth $96,800, and the county had a livestock value of $568,406 in 1900. Taxes were not collected in the area from 1893 to 1896. The Toyah-Bell Oil Company, created in 1921, became the first oil producer in the county later that year. Oil production in the area reached its height in 1931, with 1,233,801 barrels.

The county accounted for 0.057% of the wealth in Texas in 1970, and had no unemployment or any residents on welfare. The county had the sixth-highest unemployment rate in the country in 1986, with 29.7% unemployment. The &quot;Texas Almanac&quot; listed 15 ranches in the county in 1986–1987, with the average size being above 23,000 acres and being worth above an average of $4 million. The county has one of the highest per capita incomes in the United States due to oil revenue, with its residents having a per capita income of $32,505 in 1983, compared to the national average of $9,496. In 1986, taxes on oil and gas companies accounted for 99% of tax revenue in the county.

Loving County&#x27;s economy is based almost entirely upon oil and gas production, ranching, and county services.

==Education==
No federal funding was ever given to schools in the county as of 1970, and its school was still racially segregated. In 1970, the elementary school had 30 students and three teachers, while the 17 high school students were educated in Winkler County. The elementary school in Mentone was closed in 1978, as the school only had two students and two teachers left and the county voted to consolidate into the Wink-Loving Independent School District. The county is zoned to Wink-Loving Independent School District and Odessa College.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Loving County&quot; is the name of a song written and performed by Charlie Robison. It appears on his 1998 album &quot;Life of the Party&quot;.
In the novel &quot;Echo Burning&quot; by Lee Child, Jack Reacher passes through Loving County.

Count Castell of the Adelsverein negotiated with the separate Darmstadt Society of Forty to colonize 200 families on the Fisher–Miller Land Grant in Texas. In return, they were to receive $12,000 in money, livestock, and equipment, and provisions for a year. After the first year, the colonies were expected to support themselves. The colonies attempted were Castell, Leiningen, Bettina, Schoenburg and Meerholz in Llano County; Darmstädler Farm in Comal County; and Tusculum in Kendall County. Of these, only Castell survives. The colonies failed after the Adelsverein funding expired, and also due to conflict of structure and authorities. Some members moved to other Adelsverein settlements in Texas. Others moved elsewhere, or returned to Germany.

===Library book bans===
Llano county libraries were purged of books containing sex education and discussion of racism in 2021 and 2022 by county commissioners. Titles removed include &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Between the World and Me&quot;. Librarian Suzette Baker in Kingsland was fired for her refusal to remove books from the shelves. The library board voted unanimously to close its meetings to the public in 2022. After a lawsuit was filed, a federal judge ruled in March 2023 that at least 12 of the books must be placed back onto shelves. In response, county commissioners considered closing the library in a special meeting. They have appealed the decision by the federal judge.

<text>Military strategy is a set of ideas implemented by military organizations to pursue desired strategic goals. Derived from the Greek word &quot;strategos&quot;, the term strategy, when first used during the 18th century, was seen in its narrow sense as the &quot;art of the general&quot;, or &quot;the art of arrangement&quot; of troops. and deals with the planning and conduct of campaigns.

The father of Western modern strategic studies, Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831), defined military strategy as &quot;the employment of battles to gain the end of war.&quot; B. H. Liddell Hart&#x27;s definition put less emphasis on battles, defining strategy as &quot;the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy&quot;. Hence, both gave the preeminence to political aims over military goals.

Sun Tzu (544–496 BC) is often considered as the father of Eastern military strategy and greatly influenced Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese historical and modern war tactics. &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu grew in popularity and saw practical use in Western society as well. It continues to influence many competitive endeavors in Asia, Europe, and America including culture, politics, and business, as well as modern warfare. The Eastern military strategy differs from the Western by focusing more on asymmetric warfare and deception. Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; has been an important strategic and political compendium in Indian and Asian history as well.

==Fundamentals==

Military strategy is the planning and execution of the contest between groups of armed adversaries. It is a subdiscipline of warfare and of foreign policy, and a principal tool to secure national interests. Its perspective is larger than military tactics, which involve the disposition and maneuver of units on a particular sea or battlefield, but less broad than grand strategy (or &quot;national strategy&quot;), which is the overarching strategy of the largest of organizations such as the nation state, confederation, or international alliance and involves using diplomatic, informational, military and economic resources. Military strategy involves using military resources such as people, equipment, and information against the opponent&#x27;s resources to gain supremacy or reduce the opponent&#x27;s will to fight, developed through the precepts of military science.

NATO&#x27;s definition of strategy is &quot;presenting the manner in which military power should be developed and applied to achieve national objectives or those of a group of nations.&quot; Field Marshal Viscount Alanbrooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff and co-chairman of the Anglo-US Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee for most of the Second World War, described the art of military strategy as: &quot;to derive from the [policy] aim a series of military objectives to be achieved: to assess these objectives as to the military requirements they create, and the preconditions which the achievement of each is likely to necessitate: to measure available and potential resources against the requirements and to chart from this process a coherent pattern of priorities and a rational course of action.&quot; Field-Marshal Montgomery summed it up thus &quot;Strategy is the art of distributing and applying military means, such as armed forces and supplies, to fulfill the ends of policy. Tactics means the dispositions for, and control of, military forces and techniques in actual fighting. Put more shortly: strategy is the art of the conduct of war, tactics the art of fighting.&quot;

===Background===
Military strategy in the 19th century was still viewed as one of a trivium of &quot;arts&quot; or &quot;sciences&quot; that govern the conduct of warfare; the others being tactics, the execution of plans and maneuvering of forces in battle, and logistics, the maintenance of an army. The view had prevailed since the Roman times, and the borderline between strategy and tactics at this time was blurred, and sometimes categorization of a decision is a matter of almost personal opinion. Carnot, during the French Revolutionary Wars thought it simply involved concentration of troops.

As French statesman Georges Clemenceau said, &quot;War is too important a business to be left to soldiers.&quot; This gave rise to the concept of the &quot;grand strategy&quot; which encompasses the management of the resources of an entire nation in the conduct of warfare. On this issue Clausewitz stated that a successful military strategy may be a means to an end, but it is not an end in itself.

==Principles==
Many military strategists have attempted to encapsulate a successful strategy in a set of principles. Sun Tzu defined 13 principles in his &quot;The Art of War&quot; while Napoleon listed 115 maxims. American Civil War General Nathan Bedford Forrest had only one: to &quot;[get] there first with the most men&quot;. The concepts given as essential in the United States Army Field Manual of Military Operations (FM 3–0) are:

* Objective type (direct every military operation towards a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable objective)
* Offensive type (seize, retain, and exploit the initiative)
* Mass Type (concentrate combat power at the decisive place and time)
* Economy of force type (allocate minimum essential combat power to secondary efforts)
* Maneuver type (place the enemy in a disadvantageous position through the flexible application of combat power)
* Unity of command type (for every objective, ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander)
* Security type (never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage)
* Surprise type (strike the enemy at a time, at a place, or in a manner for which they are unprepared)
* Simplicity type (prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and clear, concise orders to ensure thorough understanding)

According to Greene and Armstrong, some planners assert adhering to the fundamental principles guarantees victory, while others claim war is unpredictable and the strategist must be flexible. Others argue predictability could be increased if the protagonists were to view the situation from the other sides in a conflict.

==Development==

===Antiquity===
The principles of military strategy emerged at least as far back as 500 BC in the works of Sun Tzu and Chanakya. The campaigns of Alexander the Great, Chandragupta Maurya, Hannibal, Qin Shi Huang, Julius Caesar, Zhuge Liang, Khalid ibn al-Walid and, in particular, Cyrus the Great demonstrate strategic planning and movement. 

Early strategies included the strategy of annihilation, exhaustion, attrition warfare, scorched earth action, blockade, guerrilla campaign, deception and feint. Ingenuity and adeptness were limited only by imagination, accord, and technology. Strategists continually exploited ever-advancing technology. The word &quot;strategy&quot; itself derives from the Greek &quot;στρατηγία&quot; (&quot;strategia&quot;), &quot;office of general, command, generalship&quot;, in turn from &quot;στρατηγός&quot; (&quot;strategos&quot;), &quot;leader or commander of an army, general&quot;, a compound of &quot;στρατός&quot; (&quot;stratos&quot;), &quot;army, host&quot; + &quot;ἀγός&quot; (&quot;agos&quot;), &quot;leader, chief&quot;, in turn from &quot;ἄγω&quot; (&quot;ago&quot;), &quot;to lead&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

Through maneuver and continuous assault, Chinese, Persian, Arab and Eastern European armies were stressed by the Mongols until they collapsed, and were then annihilated in pursuit and encirclement.

===Early Modern era===
In 1520 Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Dell&#x27;arte della guerra&quot; (Art of War) dealt with the relationship between civil and military matters and the formation of grand strategy. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-1648), Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden demonstrated advanced operational strategy that led to his victories on the soil of the Holy Roman Empire. It was not until the 18th century that military strategy was subjected to serious study in Europe. The word was first used in German as &quot;Strategie&quot; in a translation of Leo VI&#x27;s &quot;Tactica&quot; in 1777 by Johann von Bourscheid. From then onwards, the use of the word spread throughout the West.

===Napoleonic===

====Waterloo====


===Clausewitz and Jomini===

Clausewitz&#x27;s &quot;On War&quot; has become a famous reference
for strategy, dealing with political, as well as military, leadership, his most famous assertion being:

:&quot;War is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument, a continuation of policy by other means.&quot;

Clausewitz saw war first and foremost as a political act, and thus maintained that the purpose of all strategy was to achieve the political goal that the state was seeking to accomplish. As such, Clausewitz famously argued that war was the &quot;continuation of politics by other means&quot;. Clausewitz and Jomini are widely read by US military personnel.

===World War I===
===Interwar===
Technological change had an enormous effect on strategy, but little effect on leadership. The use of telegraph and later radio, along with improved transport, enabled the rapid movement of large numbers of men. One of Germany&#x27;s key enablers in mobile warfare was the use of radios, where these were put into every tank. However, the number of men that one officer could effectively control had, if anything, declined. The increases in the size of the armies led to an increase in the number of officers. Although the officer ranks in the US Army did swell, in the German army the ratio of officers to total men remained steady.

===World War II===

Interwar Germany had as its main strategic goals the reestablishment of Germany as a European great power and the complete annulment of the Versailles treaty of 1919. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party took power in 1933, Germany&#x27;s political goals also included the accumulation of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;Living space&quot;) for the Germanic &quot;race&quot; and the elimination of communism as a political rival to Nazism. The destruction of European Jewry, while not strictly a strategic objective, was a political goal of the Nazi regime linked to the vision of a German-dominated Europe, and especially to the Generalplan Ost for a depopulated east which Germany could colonize.

===Cold War===

Soviet strategy in the Cold War was dominated by the desire to prevent, at all costs, the recurrence of an invasion of Russian soil. The Soviet Union nominally adopted a policy of no first use, which in fact was a posture of launch on warning. Other than that, the USSR adapted to some degree to the prevailing changes in the NATO strategic policies that are divided by periods as:
* Strategy of massive retaliation (1950s) ()
* Strategy of flexible reaction (1960s) ()
* Strategies of realistic threat and containment (1970s) ()
* Strategy of direct confrontation (1980s) () one of the elements of which became the new highly effective high-precision targeting weapons.
* Strategic Defense Initiative (also known as &quot;Star Wars&quot;) during its 1980s development () which became a core part of the strategic doctrine based on Defense containment.

All-out nuclear World War III between NATO and the Warsaw Pact did not take place. The United States recently (April 2010) acknowledged a new approach to its nuclear policy which describes the weapons&#x27; purpose as &quot;primarily&quot; or &quot;fundamentally&quot; to deter or respond to a nuclear attack.

===Post–Cold War===
Strategy in the post Cold War is shaped by the global geopolitical situation: a number of potent powers in a multipolar array which has arguably come to be dominated by the hyperpower status of the United States. 

Parties to conflict which see themselves as vastly or temporarily inferior may adopt a strategy of &quot;hunkering down&quot; – witness Iraq in 1991 or Yugoslavia in 1999.

The major militaries of today are usually built to fight the &quot;last war&quot; (previous war) and hence have huge armored and conventionally configured infantry formations backed up by air forces and navies designed to support or prepare for these forces.

===Netwar===
A main point in asymmetric warfare is the nature of paramilitary organizations such as Al-Qaeda which are involved in guerrilla military actions but which are not traditional organizations with a central authority defining their military and political strategies. Organizations such as Al-Qaeda may exist as a sparse network of groups lacking central coordination, making them more difficult to confront following standard strategic approaches. This new field of strategic thinking is tackled by what is now defined as netwar.

<text>Limestone County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 22,146. Its county seat is Groesbeck. The county was created in 1846.

==History==

===Native Americans===

Natives friendly to the settlers resided in East Texas before the Kiowa, Apache and Comanche intruded upon their territory. These tribes hunted, farmed the land, and were adept traders. The Tawakoni branch of Wichita Indians originated north of Texas, but migrated south into east Texas. From 1843 onward, the Tawakoni were part of treaties made by both the Republic of Texas and the United States. Tawakoni were also sometimes known as Tehuacana. The Limestone County town of Tehuacana was settled on the former site of a Tehuacana village. The Waco people were also a branch of the Wichita Indians.

====Fort Parker massacre====

Arguably the most infamous Indian depredation in Texas took place in Limestone County on May 19, 1836, when an odd alliance of Comanche, Kiowa, Caddo, and Wichita approached Fort Parker surreptitiously under a flag of peace. The Indians subsequently attacked the fort, killing or kidnapping all but about 18 settlers who escaped to Fort Houston. Captured in the Fort Parker massacre were Elizabeth Kellogg, Rachel Plummer and her son James Pratt Plummer, John Richard Parker and his sister Cynthia Ann Parker, who later became mother of Comanche Chief Quanah Parker.

===Settlers===

Limestone County was part of the Haden Harrison Edwards (800 families) and Robertson&#x27;s Colony (800 families) &quot;empresario &quot;grants made by the Coahuila y Texas legislature in 1825. By contracting how many families each grantee could settle, the government sought to have some control over colonization.

Baptist spiritual leader Daniel Parker and eight other men organized the Pilgrim Predestinarian Regular Baptist Church in Lamotte, Illinois. The fellowship in its entirety migrated in 1833 to the new frontier of Texas. Among this group of settlers were Silas M. Parker, Moses Herrin, Elisha Anglin, Luther T. M. Plummer, David Faulkenberry, Joshua Hadley, and Samuel Frost. Fort Parker, near the Navasota River in what is now central Limestone County, was the earliest actual settlement in the vicinity. Following on the heels of the original settlers, other communities were established.

===County established===

On April 11, 1846, Limestone County was formed from Robertson County. On August 18, 1846, the county was organized. Springfield became the county seat. The county seat was moved to Groesbeck in 1873 after boundary changes, and the Springfield courthouse had burned down.

Homesteaders became self-sustaining farmers and ranchers, who also hunted wild game. Support businesses were connected to the repair and maintenance of farm equipment and livestock. The population of 1860 was 4,537. Of these, 3,464 were White, 1,072 were slaves, and one was a free Black female.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

Limestone County voted 525–9 in favor of secession from the Union, and sent its men to fight for the Confederate States of America. Lochlin Johnson Farrar raised the first Confederate company from the county. Reconstruction in the county was so contentious, with racial violence and threats against the government, that on October 9, 1871, Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis declared the county under martial law.

===Post-Civil War development===

The Houston and Texas Central Railway laid tracks in 1869, terminating near Kosse which was named after the railway&#x27;s chief engineer Theodore Kosse. The Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway, laid track in 1903 from Cleburne to Mexia. Several towns were established on these routes.

The Thornton Institute was founded in 1877 by Edward Coke Chambers, and was chartered in 1881 as the Thornton Male and Female Institute. The school provided a type of dormitory for the students, and sent many graduates out to teach in rural Texas. Henry P. Davis acquired the school in 1889, and in 1891 the school was given to the Thornton Independent School District.

Oil and gas were discovered in Mexia between 1913 and 1920, creating jobs and a population boom - from just 3,482 people to 35,000 in 1922. Martial law had to be briefly declared in Mexia. The population began to decline during the Great Depression. Camp Mexia, a German prisoner of war camp was built during World War II.

The Work Projects Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps helped ease the county economy during the Great Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps built Fort Parker State Recreation Area. The WPA erected a number of buildings in the county.

==Politics==
Like the majority of Southern counties, Limestone was traditionally dominated by the Democratic Party, consisting voting for it by wide majorities upon statehood. Limestone&#x27;s Democratic dominance was shown by its Civil War history, in which it voted for secession by 98% and raised multiple companies to fight for the Confederacy. This Democratic dominance continued well into the 20th century, where Limestone County only voted for five Republicans at any level, all during national and statewide landslides. Since the turn of the 21st century, Limestone County has followed the rest of rural Texas in becoming strongly Republican, with Republicans gaining in vote percentage in every single election so far (aside from a less than 1% decrease in 2020). In 2024, Limestone County gave Republicans their highest share of the vote in county history.

== History ==
The legislature of the Republic of Texas authorized Leon County in 1846 from part of Robertson County, and named it in honor of Martín de León, the founder of Victoria, Texas.

The county was organized that same year, with its first county seat at Leona. In 1851, the county seat was moved to Centerville, since Leona was in the far southern part of the county.

The 1886 Leon County Courthouse was designed by architect George Edwin Dickey of Houston, incorporating remnants of an earlier 1858 courthouse that was destroyed by fire. The courthouse was rededicated on July 1, 2007, following a full restoration to a 1909 date.

==Politics==
Lee County was historically Democratic, although less so than the majority of Texas, as it was somewhat allied with the isolated Republican German-American Unionist stronghold centered in Gillespie and Kendall Counties. It nonetheless voted Democratic in every election up to 1976 except the landslide Republican triumphs of 1956 and 1972, plus the heavily war-influenced elections of 1916 and 1940, when its German-American population was suspicious of the Democratic Party&#x27;s position towards Germany. Since 1980, like all of the rural white South, Lee County has become powerfully Republican. No Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority in the county since Jimmy Carter in 1976, although during the drought- and farm crisis-dominated 1988 election Michael Dukakis won a 14-vote plurality. In the past five elections, the GOP candidate has always passed two-thirds of the county&#x27;s vote and Donald Trump exceeded three-quarters in 2016, 2020, and 2024.

<text>Lampasas County ( ) is a county located on the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 21,627. Its county seat is Lampasas. The county is named for the Lampasas River.

Lampasas County is part of the Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood metropolitan area.

==History==

Indigenous peoples were the first inhabitants of the area. Later known tribes in the area included Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche. The Aguayo expedition is said to have passed through the county in 1721.
In 1756 a presidio was established by Don Pedro de Terreros with the assistance of elements of the Spanish Army, at the confluence of Lucy Creek and Arroya Cavalto. The effort was abandoned not long after, but the site remained as a base of operations by Thomas Isaac Cox, a member of Terreros&#x27; original expedition, for the purpose of obtaining hundreds of Texas mustangs for use by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

In 1853 Moses Hughes and his invalid wife, Hannah (Berry), became the first permanent settlers, seeking to take advantage of the medicinal springs. John Patterson was the first man to cultivate land in the county, in 1854. In 1855 Elizabeth and George W. Scott laid out the town of Burleson, named for her father. The town was renamed Lampasas, when it became the county seat; the Sixth Texas Legislature formed Lampasas County, named after the Lampasas River, from parts of Travis, Bell, and Coryell Counties, in 1856. In 1858 The northeastern corner of Lampasas County became part of Hamilton County. In 1887 Mills County received northern and northwestern sections of Lampasas County.

The Lampasas Guards were organized to ward off Indian attacks in 1859. Indian raids increased in 1861, as able-bodied men were off fighting in the war.

In 1872 Townsen&#x27;s Mill was built by Perry and Jasper Townsen. This steam mill cut &quot;rawhide&quot; lumber and ground wheat and corn. Henry A. Chadwick and son Milam built a sawmill, flour mill and cotton gin in 1874.
In 1875 the Farmers&#x27; Alliance was born in Lampasas in reaction against the cattle rustling and illegal land dealings prevalent in the county.
1877 saw the gunfight at the Lampasas Saloon.

In 1882 The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway extended its line west from Belton to Lampasas. The Texas Power and Light Company arrived in Lampasas County in the 1920s, and in 1934 the Lower Colorado River Authority brought electricity to the county. Lone Star Gas established services in the county in 1949.

During World War II in 1942, Fort Hood opened as a military training base. Hancock Park in Lampasas was temporarily turned over to the troops as a recreational area.
