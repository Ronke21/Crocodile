<text>Salsa music is a style of Latin American music, combining elements of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and American influences. Because most of the basic musical components predate the labeling of salsa, there have been many controversies regarding its origin. Most songs considered as salsa are primarily based on son montuno and son Cubano, with elements of cha-cha-chá, bolero, rumba, mambo, jazz, R&amp;B, bomba, and plena. All of these elements are adapted to fit the basic Son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa.

Originally the name salsa was used to label commercially several styles of Hispanic Caribbean music, but nowadays it is considered a musical style on its own and one of the staples of Hispanic American culture.

While the term salsa today is a rebranding of various Latin musical styles, the first self-identified salsa band is Cheo Marquetti y su Conjunto - Los Salseros which was formed in 1955. The first album to mention Salsa on its cover was titled “Salsa” which was released by La Sonora Habanera in 1957. Later on self-identified salsa bands were predominantly assembled by Puerto Rican and Cuban musicians in New York City in the 1970s. The music style was based on the late son montuno of Arsenio Rodríguez, Conjunto Chappottín and Roberto Faz. These musicians included Celia Cruz, Willie Colón, Rubén Blades, Johnny Pacheco, Machito and Héctor Lavoe. 
During the same period a parallel modernization of Cuban son was being developed by Los Van Van, Irakere, NG La Banda, Charanga Habanera and other artists in Cuba under the name of songo and timba, styles that at present are also labelled as salsa. Though limited by an embargo, the continuous cultural exchange between salsa-related musicians inside and outside of Cuba is undeniable.

==Origins of the term Salsa==

The word &quot;Salsa&quot; means sauce in the Spanish language. The origin of the connection of this word to a style of music is disputed by various music writers and historians.

The musicologist Max Salazar traced the origin of the connection to 1930 when Ignacio Piñeiro composed the song &quot;Échale salsita&quot; (Put some sauce in it). The phrase is seen as a cry from Piñeiro to his band, telling them to increase the tempo to &quot;put the dancers into high gear&quot;. In the mid-1940s, Cuban Cheo Marquetti emigrated to Mexico. He named his group Conjunto Los Salseros, with whom he recorded a couple of albums for the Panart and Egrem labels. Later on, while based in Mexico City, the musician Beny Moré would shout &quot;salsa&quot; during a performance to acknowledge a musical moment&#x27;s heat, making a connection with the hot salsa (sauce) made in the country.

Puerto Rican music promoter Izzy Sanabria claims he was the first to use the word salsa to denote a music genre:
In 1973, I hosted the television show &quot;Salsa&quot; which was the first reference to this particular music as &quot;salsa&quot;. I was using [the term] &quot;salsa&quot;, but the music wasn&#x27;t defined by that. The music was still defined as Latin music. And that was a very, very broad category, because it even includes mariachi music. It includes everything. So salsa defined this particular type of music ... It&#x27;s a name that everyone could pronounce.

Sanabria&#x27;s &quot;Latin New York&quot; magazine was an English language publication. Consequently, his promoted events were covered in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines. Sanabria confessed the term salsa was not developed by musicians: &quot;Musicians were busy creating the music but played no role in promoting the name salsa.&quot; For this reason the use of the term salsa has been controversial among musicians. Some have praised its unification element. Celia Cruz said, &quot;Salsa is Cuban music with another name. It&#x27;s mambo, chachachá, rumba, son ... all the Cuban rhythms under one name.&quot; Willie Colón described salsa not as a precise musical style but a power to unite in the broadest terms: &quot;Salsa was the force that united diverse Latino and other non-Latino racial and ethnic groups ...Salsa is the harmonic sum of all Latin culture &quot;. 
On the other hand, even some New York based artists were originally against the commercialization of music under that name; Machito said: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing new about salsa, it is just the same old music that was played in Cuba for over fifty years.&quot; Similarly, Tito Puente stated: &quot;The only salsa I know is sold in a bottle called ketchup. I play Cuban music. Cuban musicologist Mayra Martínez wrote that &quot;the term salsa obscured the Cuban base, the music&#x27;s history or part of its history in Cuba. And salsa was a way to do this so that Jerry Masucci, Fania and other record companies, like CBS, could have a hegemony on the music and keep the Cuban musicians from spreading their music abroad.&quot; Izzy Sanabria responded that Martínez was likely giving an accurate Cuban viewpoint, &quot;but salsa was not planned that way&quot;. Johnny Pacheco, co-founder of Fania Records gave his definition of the term “Salsa” during various interviews. “La salsa es, y siempre ha sido la musica Cubana.” “Salsa is, and always has been, Cuban music.”. 

The marketing potential from the name was so big, that eventually both Machito, Puente and even musicians in Cuba embraced the term as a financial necessity.

==Instrumentation==

The instrumentation in salsa bands is mostly based on the son montuno ensemble developed by Arsenio Rodríguez, who added a horn section, as well as tumbadoras (congas) to the traditional Son cubano ensemble; which typically contained bongos, bass, tres, one trumpet, smaller hand-held percussion instruments (like claves, güiro, or maracas) usually played by the singers, and sometimes a piano. Machito&#x27;s band was the first to experiment with the timbales. These three drums (bongos, congas and timbales) became the standard percussion instruments in most salsa bands and function in similar ways to a traditional drum ensemble. The timbales play the bell pattern, the congas play the supportive drum part, and the bongos improvise, simulating a lead drum. The improvised variations of the bongos are executed within the context of a repetitive marcha, known as the &quot;martillo&quot; (&#x27;hammer&#x27;), and do not constitute a solo. The bongos play primarily during the verses and the piano solos. When the song transitions into the montuno section, the bongo player picks up a large hand held cowbell called the bongo bell. Often the &quot;bongocero&quot; plays the bell more during a piece, than the actual bongos. The interlocking counterpoint of the timbale bell and bongo bell provides a propelling force during the montuno. The maracas and güiro sound a steady flow of regular pulses (subdivisions) and are ordinarily clave-neutral.

Nonetheless, some bands instead follow the Charanga format, which consists of a string section (of violins, viola, and cello), tumbadoras (congas), timbales, bass, flute, claves and güiro. Bongos are not typically used in charanga bands. Típica 73, Orquesta Broadway, Orquesta Revé and Orquesta Ritmo Oriental where popular Salsa bands with charanga instrumentation. Johnny Pacheco, Charlie Palmieri, Mongo Santamaría and Ray Barretto also experimented with this format.

Latin big bands in the 1950s-1960s included a brass section of trumpets and saxes.

Throughout its 50 years of life, Los Van Van have always experimented with both types of ensembles. The first 15 years the band was a pure charanga, but later a trombone section was added. Nowadays the band could be considered a hybrid.

In the 1960s, Eddie Palmieri decided to replace the violins with two trombones for a heavier sound.

==Rhythm==
Salsa music typically ranges from 160 bpm (beats per minute) and 220 bpm, which is suitable for salsa dancing.

The key instrument that provides the core groove of a salsa song is the clave. It is often played with two wooden sticks (called clave) that are hit together. Every instrument in a salsa band is either playing with the clave (generally: congas, timbales, piano, tres guitar, bongos, claves (instrument), strings) or playing independent of the clave rhythm (generally: bass, maracas, güiro, cowbell). Melodic components of the music and dancers can choose to be in clave or out of clave at any point.
For salsa, there are four types of clave rhythms, the 3-2 and 2-3 Son claves being the most important, and the 3-2 and 2-3 Rumba claves. Most salsa music is played with one of the son claves, though a rumba clave is occasionally used, especially during rumba sections of some songs. As an example of how a clave fits within the 8 beats of a salsa dance, the beats of the 2-3 Son clave are played on the counts of 2, 3, 5, the &quot;and&quot; of 6, and 8.

There are other common rhythms found in salsa music: the chord beat, the tumbao, and the Montuno rhythm.

The chord beat (often played on cowbell) emphasizes the odd-numbered counts of salsa: 1, 3, 5 and 7 while the tumbao rhythm (often played on congas) emphasizes the &quot;off-beats&quot; of the music: 2, 4, 6, and 8. Some dancers like to use the strong sound of the cowbell to stay on the Salsa rhythm. Alternatively, others use the conga rhythm to create a jazzier feel to their dance since strong &quot;off-beats&quot; are a jazz element.

Tumbao is the name of the rhythm that is typically played with the conga drums. Its most basic pattern is played on the beats 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8. Tumbao rhythm is helpful for learning to dance contra-tiempo (&quot;On2&quot;). The beats 2 and 6 are emphasized when dancing On2, and the Tumbao rhythm heavily emphasizes those beats as well.

The Montuno rhythm is a rhythm that is often played with a piano. The Montuno rhythm loops over the 8 counts and is useful for finding the direction of the music. By listening to the same rhythm, that loops back to the beginning after eight counts, one can recognize which count is the first beat of the music.

==Musical structure==

Most salsa compositions follow the basic son montuno model based on the Afro-Cuban clave rhythm and composed of a verse section, followed by a coro-pregón (call-and-response) chorus section known as the montuno. The verse section can be short, or expanded to feature the lead vocalist and/or carefully crafted melodies with clever rhythmic devices. Once the montuno section begins, it usually continues until the end of the song. The tempo may gradually increase during the montuno in order to build excitement. The montuno section can be divided into various sub-sections sometimes referred to as &quot;mambo&quot;, &quot;diablo&quot;, &quot;moña&quot;, and &quot;especial&quot;.

==History==
===1930s and 1940s: Origins in Cuba===
Many musicologists find many of the components of salsa music in the Son Montuno of several artists of the 30s and 40s like Arsenio Rodríguez, Conjunto Chappottín (Arsenio&#x27;s former band now led by Félix Chappottín and featuring Luis &quot;Lilí&quot; Martínez Griñán) and Roberto Faz. Salsa musician Eddie Palmieri once said &quot;When you talk about our music, you talk about before, or after, Arsenio...Lilí Martínez was my mentor&quot;. Several songs of Arsenio&#x27;s band, like &quot;Fuego en el 23&quot;, &quot;El Divorcio&quot;, &quot;Hacheros pa&#x27; un palo&quot;, &quot;Bruca maniguá&quot;, &quot;No me llores&quot; and &quot;El reloj de Pastora&quot; were later covered by many salsa bands (like Sonora Ponceña and Johnny Pacheco).

On the other hand, a different style, Mambo, was developed by Cachao, Beny Moré and Dámaso Pérez Prado. Moré and Pérez Prado moved to Mexico City where the music was played by Mexican big band wind orchestras.

===1950s-1960s: Cuban music in New York City===

During the 1950s, New York became a hotspot of Mambo with musicians like the aforementioned Pérez Prado, Luciano &quot;Chano&quot; Pozo, Mongo Santamaría, Machito and Tito Puente. The highly popular Palladium Ballroom was the epicenter of mambo in New York.

Ethnomusicologist Ed Morales notes that the interaction of Afro-Cuban and jazz music in New York was crucial to the innovation of both forms of music. Musicians who would become great innovators of mambo, like Mario Bauzá and Chano Pozo, began their careers in New York working in close conjunction with some of the biggest names in jazz, like Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dizzy Gillespie, among others. Morales noted that: &quot;The interconnection between North American jazz and Afro-Cuban music was taken for granted, and the stage was set for the emergence of mambo music in New York, where music fans were becoming accustomed to innovation.&quot; He later notes that Mambo helped pave the way for the widespread acceptance of salsa years later.

Another popular style was cha-cha-cha, which originated in the Charanga bands in Cuba. By the early 1960s, there were several charanga bands in New York led by musicians (like Johnny Pacheco, Charlie Palmieri, Mongo Santamaría and Ray Barretto) who would later become salsa stars.

In 1952, Arsenio Rodríguez moved for a short period to New York City taking with him his modern son montuno. During that period his success was limited (NYC was more interested in Mambo), but his guajeos (who influenced the musicians he shared the stage with, such as Chano Pozo, Machito, and Mario Bauzá), together with the piano tumbaos of Lilí Martínez, the trumpet of Félix Chappottín and the rhythmic lead vocals of Roberto Faz would become very relevant in the region a decade later.

In 1966, the Palladium closed because it lost its liquor license. The mambo faded away, as new hybrid styles such as boogaloo, the jala-jala and the shing-a-ling had brief but important success. Elements of boogaloo can be heard in some songs of Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, Machito and even Arsenio Rodríguez. Nonetheless, Puente later recounted: &quot;It stunk ... I recorded it to keep up with the times. Popular Boogaloo songs include &quot;Bang Bang&quot; by the Joe Cuba Sextet and &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; by Pete Rodríguez and His Orchestra.

During the late 1960s, the Dominican musician Johnny Pacheco and Italian-American businessman Jerry Masucci founded the recording company Fania Records. They introduced many of the artists that would later be identified with the salsa movement, including Willie Colón, Celia Cruz, Larry Harlow, Ray Barretto, Héctor Lavoe and Ismael Miranda. Fania&#x27;s first record album was &quot;Cañonazo&quot;, recorded and released in 1964. It was panned by music critics as 10 of the 11 songs were covers of previously recorded tunes by such Cuban artists as Sonora Matancera, Chappottín y Sus Estrellas and Conjunto Estrellas de Chocolate. Pacheco put together a team that included percussionist Louie Ramírez, bassist Bobby Valentín and arranger Larry Harlow to form the Fania All-Stars in 1968. Meanwhile, the Puerto Rican band La Sonora Ponceña recorded two albums named after songs of Arsenio Rodriguez (&quot;Hachero pa&#x27; un palo&quot; and &quot;Fuego en el 23&quot;).

===1970s: Songo in Cuba, salsa in NYC===
The 1970s was witness to two parallel modernizations of the Cuban son in Havana and in New York. During this period the term salsa was introduced in New York, and songo was developed in Havana.

The band Los Van Van, led by the bassist Juan Formell, started developing songo in the late 1960s. Songo incorporated rhythmic elements from folkloric rumba as well as funk and rock to the traditional son. With the arrival of the drummer Changuito, several new rhythms were introduced and the style had a more significant departure from the son montuno/mambo-based structure.

Songo integrated several elements of North American styles like jazz, rock and funk in many different ways than mainstream salsa. Whereas salsa would superimpose elements of another genre in the bridge of a song, the songo was considered a rhythmic and harmonic hybrid (particularly regarding funk and clave-based Cuban elements). The music analyst Kevin Moore stated: &quot;The harmonies, never before heard in Cuban music, were clearly borrowed from North American pop [and] shattered the formulaic limitations on harmony to which Cuban popular music had faithfully adhered for so long.&quot; During the same period, Cuban super group Irakere fused bebop and funk with batá drums and other Afro-Cuban folkloric elements; Orquesta Ritmo Oriental created a new highly syncopated, rumba-influenced son in the charanga ensemble; and Elio Revé developed changüí.
On the other hand, New York saw in the 1970s the first use of the term salsa to commercialize several styles of Latin dance music. However, several musicians believe that salsa took on a life of its own, organically evolving into an authentic pan-Latin American cultural identity. Music professor and salsa trombonist Christopher Washburne wrote:

This pan-Latino association of salsa stems from what Félix Padilla labels a &#x27;Latinizing&#x27; process that occurred in the 1960s and was consciously marketed by Fania Records: &#x27;To Fania, the Latinizing of salsa came to mean homogenizing the product, presenting an all-embracing Puerto Rican, Pan-American or Latino sound with which the people from all of Latin America and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States could identify and purchase.&#x27; Motivated primarily by economic factors, Fania&#x27;s push for countries throughout Latin America to embrace salsa did result in an expanded market. But in addition, throughout the 1970s, salsa groups from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, among other Latin American nations, emerged, composing and performing music that related to their own specific cultural experiences and affiliations, which posited salsa as a cultural identity marker for those nations as well.

In 1971, the Fania All-Stars sold out Yankee Stadium. By the early 1970s, the music&#x27;s center moved to Manhattan and the Cheetah, where promoter Ralph Mercado introduced many future Puerto Rican salsa stars to an ever-growing and diverse crowd of Latino audiences. The 1970s also brought new semi-known Salsa bands from New York City, bands such as Ángel Canales, Andy Harlow, Chino Rodríguez y su Consagracion (Chino Rodríguez was one of the first Chinese Puerto Rican artists that caught the eye of Fania Record&#x27;s owner Jerry Masucci and later became the booking agent for many of the Fania artists.), Wayne Gorbea, Ernie Agusto y la Conspiración, Orchestra Ray Jay, Orchestra Fuego, and Orchestra Cimarron, among other bands that were performing in the Salsa market on the East Coast.

Celia Cruz, who had had a successful career in Cuba with Sonora Matancera, was able to transition into the salsa movement, eventually becoming known as &quot;the Queen of Salsa&quot;.

Larry Harlow stretched out from the typical salsa record formula with his opera &quot;Hommy&quot; (1973), inspired by The Who&#x27;s Tommy album, and also released his critically acclaimed &quot;La Raza Latina, a Salsa Suite&quot;.

In 1975, Roger Dawson created the &quot;Sunday Salsa Show&quot; over WRVR FM, which became one of the highest-rated radio shows in the New York market with a reported audience of over a quarter of a million listeners every Sunday (per Arbitron Radio Ratings). Ironically, although New York&#x27;s Hispanic population at that time was over two million, there had been no commercial Hispanic FM. Given his jazz and salsa conga playing experience and knowledge (working as a sideman with such bands as salsa&#x27;s Frankie Dante&#x27;s Orquesta Flamboyán and jazz saxophonist Archie Shepp), Dawson also created the long-running &quot;Salsa Meets Jazz&quot; weekly concert series at the Village Gate jazz club where jazz musicians would sit in with an established salsa band, for example Dexter Gordon jamming with the Machito band. Dawson helped to broaden New York&#x27;s salsa audience and introduced new artists such as the bilingual Ángel Canales who were not given play on the Hispanic AM stations of that time. His show won several awards from the readers of Latin New York magazine, Izzy Sanabria&#x27;s &quot;Salsa Magazine&quot; at that time and ran until late 1980 when Viacom changed the format of WRVR to country music.

Despite an openness to experimentation and a willingness to absorb non-Cuban influences, such as jazz, R&amp;B, bomba and plena, and already existing mambo-jazz, the percentage of salsa compositions based in non-Cuban genres during this period in New York is quite low, and, contrary to songo, salsa remained consistently wedded to older Cuban templates. Some believe the pan-Latin Americanism of salsa was found in its cultural milieu, more than its musical structure.

An exception of this is probably found in the work of Eddie Palmieri and Manny Oquendo, who were considered more adventurous than the highly produced Fania records artists. The two bands incorporated less superficially jazz elements as well as the contemporary Mozambique (music). They were known for its virtuous trombone soloists like Barry Rogers (and other &quot;Anglo&quot; jazz musicians who had mastered the style). Andy González, a bass player who performed with Palmieri and Oquendo recounts: &quot;We were into improvising ... doing that thing Miles Davis was doing — playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set.&quot; Andy and his brother Jerry González started showing up in the DownBeat Reader&#x27;s Poll, and caught the attention of jazz critics.

===1980s: Salsa expansion in Latin America and the birth of timba===
During the 1980s, several Latin American countries, such as Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico and Panama, began producing their own salsa music. Two of the biggest stars from this period are Oscar D&#x27;León from Venezuela and Joe Arroyo from Colombia. Other popular acts are Fruko y sus Tesos, Grupo Niche and Rubén Blades (now as a soloist).

During this period Cuba received international salsa musicians for the first time.

Venezuelan salsa star Oscar D&#x27;León&#x27;s 1983 tour of Cuba is mentioned prominently by every Cuban I&#x27;ve ever interviewed on the subject. Rubén Blades&#x27; album &quot;Siembra&quot; was heard everywhere on the island throughout the mid-80s and has been quoted extensively in the guías and coros of everyone from Van Van&#x27;s Mayito Rivera (who quotes [Blades&#x27;] &#x27;Plástico&#x27; in his guías on the 1997 classic &quot;Llévala a tu vacilón&quot;), to El Médico de la Salsa (quoting another major hook from &#x27;Plástico&#x27;—&#x27;se ven en la cara, se ven en la cara, nunca en el corazón&#x27;—in his final masterpiece before leaving Cuba, &quot;Diós sabe&quot;).

Prior to D&#x27;León&#x27;s performance, many Cuban musicians rejected the salsa movement, considering it a bad imitation of Cuban music. Some people say that D&#x27;León&#x27;s performance gave momentum to a &quot;salsa craze&quot; that brought back some of the older templates and motivated the development of timba.

Before the birth of timba, Cuban dance music lived a period of high experimentation among several bands like the charangas: Los Van Van, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental, and Orquesta Revé; the conjuntos: Adalberto Alvarez y Son 14, Conjunto Rumbavana and Orquesta Maravillas de Florida; and the jazz band Irakere. 
Timba was created by musicians of Irakere who later formed NG La Banda under the direction of Jose Luis &quot;El Tosco&quot; Cortez. Many timba songs are more related to main-stream salsa than its Cuban predecessors earlier in the decade. For example, the song &quot;La expresiva&quot; (of NG La Banda) uses typical salsa timba/bongo bell combinations. The tumbadoras (congas) play elaborate variations on the son montuno-based tumbao, rather than in the songo style. For this reason some Cuban musicians of this period like Manolito y su Trabuco, Orquesta Sublime, and Irakere referred to this late-80s sound as &quot;salsa cubana&quot;, a term which for the first time, included Cuban music as a part of salsa movement. In the mid-1990s California-based Bembé Records released CDs by several Cuban bands, as part of their &quot;salsa cubana series&quot;.

Nonetheless, this style included several innovations. The bass tumbaos were busier and more complex than tumbaos typically heard in NY salsa. Some guajeos were inspired by the &quot;harmonic displacement&quot; technique of the Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba. Curiously, it was in Cuba where hip hop and salsa first began to meet. For example, many breakdown sections in NG La Banda&#x27;s album &quot;En la calle&quot; are a combination of guaguancó and hip hop rhythms.

During this period, Cuban musicians had more of an impact on jazz than salsa in the United States. Even though the Mariel boatlift took hundreds of Cuban musicians to the US, many of them were astonished to hear what sounded to them like Cuban music from the 1950s. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: &quot;When the Cubans arrived in New York, they all said &#x27;Yuk! This is old music.&#x27; The music and the feelings and arrangements [haven&#x27;t] changed.&quot; Nonetheless, there was an awareness of the modern Cuban styles in the US. Tito Puente recorded the Irakere composition &quot;Bacalao con pan&quot; (1980), and Rubén Blades covered Los Van Van&#x27;s &quot;Muevete&quot; (1985). While the Puerto Rican bands Batacumbele (featuring a young Giovanni Hidalgo) and Zaperoko fully embraced songo music under the mentorship of Changuito.

During the &#x27;80s other variants of salsa like salsa romántica and salsa erótica evolved, with lyrics dwelling on love and romance. Salsa romántica can be traced back to &quot;Noches Calientes&quot;, a 1984 album by singer José Alberto &quot;El Canario&quot; with producer Louie Ramírez. Some viewed salsa romántica as a rhythmically watered-down version of the genre. Critics of &quot;salsa romántica&quot;, especially in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, called it a commercialized, diluted form of Latin pop, in which formulaic, sentimental love ballads were simply put to Afro-Cuban rhythms — leaving no room for classic salsa&#x27;s brilliant musical improvisation, or for classic salsa lyrics that tell stories of daily life or provide social and political commentary. Some artists of these styles include Ómar Alfann, Palmer Hernández and Jorge Luis Piloto.

===1990s: Pop salsa and timba explosion===
The 1990s was marked by &quot;pop salsa&quot; in the US, and the &quot;timba explosion&quot; in Cuba.

Sergio George produced several albums that mixed salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, Víctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: &quot;Though clave is considered, it is not always the most important thing in my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that&#x27;s what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave.&quot; As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass:

Marc Anthony is a product of George&#x27;s innovationist approach. As a novice to Latin music, he was propelled into band leader position with little knowledge of how the music was structured. One revealing moment came during a performance in 1994, just after he had launched his salsa career. During a piano solo he approached the timbales, picked up a stick, and attempted to play clave on the clave block along with the band. It became apparent that he had no idea where to place the rhythm. Shortly thereafter during a radio interview in San Juan (Puerto Rico), he exclaimed that his commercial success proved that you did not need to know about clave to make it in Latin music. This comment caused an uproar both in Puerto Rico and New York. After receiving the bad press, Anthony refrained from discussing the subject in public, and he did not attempt to play clave on stage until he had received some private lessons.

In Cuba, what came to be known as the &quot;timba explosion&quot; began with the debut album of La Charanga Habanera, &quot;Me Sube La Fiebre&quot;, in 1992.
Like NG La Banda, Charanga Habanera used several new techniques like gear changes and song-specific tumbaos, but their musical style was drastically different and it kept changing and evolving with each album. Charanga Habanera underwent three distinct style periods in the 90s, represented by the three albums
Manolín &quot;El Médico de la salsa&quot;, an amateur songwriter discovered and named by El Tosco (NG La Banda) at med school, was another superstar of the period. Manolín&#x27;s creative team included several arrangers, including Luis Bu and Chaka Nápoles. As influential as Manolín was from a strictly musical point of view, his charisma, popularity and unprecedented earning power had an even more seismic impact, causing a level of excitement among musicians that had not been seen since the 1950s. Reggie Jackson referred to Manolin as &quot;the straw that stirs the drink.&quot;—Moore (2010: v. 5: 18)

The term &quot;salsa cubana&quot; which had barely taken hold, again fell out of favor, and was replaced with &quot;timba&quot;. Some of the other important timba bands include Azúcar Negra, Manolín &quot;El Médico de la salsa&quot;, Havana d&#x27;Primera, Klimax, Paulito FG, Salsa Mayor, Tiempo Libre, Pachito Alonso y sus Kini Kini, Bamboleo, Los Dan Den, Alain Pérez, Issac Delgado, Tirso Duarte, Klimax, Manolito y su Trabuco, Paulo FG, and Pupy y Los que Son Son.

Cuban timba musicians and New York salsa musicians have had positive and creative exchanges over the years, but the two genres remained somewhat separated, appealing to different audiences. Nonetheless, in 2000 Los Van Van were awarded the first ever Grammy Award for Best Salsa Album.

In Colombia, salsa remained a popular style of music producing popular bands like Sonora Carruseles, Carlos Vives, Orquesta Guayacan, Grupo Niche, Kike Santander, and Julian Collazos. The city of Cali became known as Colombia&#x27;s &quot;capital of salsa&quot;. In Venezuela, Cabijazz was playing a unique modern blend of timba-like salsa with a strong jazz influence.

===2010s: Timba-fusion hits===
During the late 00s and the 10s, some timba bands created new hybrids of salsa, timba, hip hop and reggaeton (for example Charanga Habanera - &quot;Gozando en la Habana&quot; and Pupy y Los que Son, Son-&quot;Loco con una moto&quot;). A few years later the Cuban reggaeton band Gente de Zona and Marc Anthony produced the timba-reggaeton international mega-hit &quot;La Gozadera&quot; reaching over a billion views in YouTube.

The style known as Cubaton, that was also popular during this period, was mostly based on reggaeton with only some hints of salsa/timba.

==African salsa==

Cuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1&quot;. states:

Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a result of airplay over Radio Congo Belge, a powerful radio station based in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa DRC). A proliferation of music clubs, recording studios, and concert appearances of Cuban bands in Léopoldville spurred on the Cuban music trend during the late 1940s and 1950s.

Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music &quot;rumba&quot;, although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as soukous.

Cuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: &quot;It was the Cuban connection, but increasingly also New York salsa, that provided the major and enduring influences—the ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized.&quot; The re-working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle.

The re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: &quot;The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer&#x27;s appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music.&quot;

The largest wave of Cuban-based music to hit Africa was in the form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars performed in Zaire (known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as &quot;Live In Africa&quot; (&quot;Salsa Madness&quot; in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred at a music festival held in conjunction with the Muhammad Ali/George Foreman heavyweight title fight. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the Senegambia and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal&#x27;s nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s. The Senegalese band Orchestra Baobab plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.

According to Lise Waxer, &quot;African salsa points not so much to a return of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of cultural appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World.&quot; Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group Africando, where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, Ricardo Lemvo, Ismael Lo and Salif Keita. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.

==Lyrics==
Salsa lyrics range from simple dance numbers, and sentimental romantic songs, to risque and politically radical subject matter. Music author Isabelle Leymarie notes that salsa performers often incorporate machoistic (&quot;guapería&quot;) in their lyrics, in a manner reminiscent of calypso and samba, a theme she ascribes to the performers&#x27; &quot;humble backgrounds&quot; and subsequent need to compensate for their origins. Leymarie claims that salsa is &quot;essentially virile, an affirmation of the man&#x27;s pride and identity&quot;. As an extension of salsa&#x27;s macho stance, manly taunts and challenges (&quot;desafio&quot;) are also a traditional part of salsa.

Salsa lyrics often quote from traditional Cuban sones and rumbas. Sometimes there are references to Afro-Cuban religions, such as &quot;Santeria&quot;, even by artists who are not themselves practitioners of the faith. Salsa lyrics also exhibit Puerto Rican influences. Hector LaVoe, who sang with Willie Colón for nearly a decade used typical Puerto Rican phrasing in his singing. It is not uncommon now to hear the Puerto Rican declamatory exclamation &quot;le-lo-lai&quot; in salsa. Politically and socially activist composers have long been an important part of salsa, and some of their works, like Eddie Palmieri&#x27;s &quot;La libertad - lógico&quot;, became Latin, and especially Puerto Rican anthems. The Panamanian singer Ruben Blades in particular is well known for his socially-conscious and incisive salsa lyrics about everything from imperialism to disarmament and environmentalism, which have resonated with audiences throughout Latin America. Many salsa songs contain a nationalist theme, centered around a sense of pride in black Latino identity, and may be in Spanish, English or a mixture of the two called &quot;Spanglish.&quot;

<text>The Landis Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans the Little Conestoga Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the Little Conestoga #1 Bridge. The bridge, built in 1873 by Elias McMellen, is today surrounded by a development, shopping center, and highways on the boundary of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. At , it is the shortest covered bridge in the county.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double pyramidal-shaped Burr-type trusses and multiple king post truss design with the addition of steel hanger rods. It is the only bridge in the county to use this design. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both portals to the bridge are painted in red with white trim.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-16. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003526. It is located at (40.06800, -76.34483). It can be found northwest of Lancaster on Shreiner Road one block West of the Park City Center shopping mall.

== History ==
Landis Mill Covered Bridge was built in 1873 by Elias McMellen at a cost of $969. McMellen, who built many of Lancaster&#x27;s covered bridges using the Burr arch truss, chose to build this short bridge using a simpler design with multiple kingpost trusses and, instead of Burr arches, pyramidal-shaped trusses to add additional support. The bridge has remained despite the development of the surrounding countryside. Landis Mill Covered Bridge crosses the Little Conestoga Creek just a block west of Park City Mall. Built in 1873, this covered bridge uses the Kingpost Truss, no arch, and at only 53 feet long, it is the shortest covered bridge in Lancaster county.

<text>The Pinetown Bushong&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that spans the Conestoga River in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. A county-owned and maintained bridge, its official designation is the Big Conestoga #6 Bridge. The bridge is also known as Pinetown Covered Bridge, Nolte&#x27;s Point Mill Bridge and Bushong&#x27;s Mill Bridge.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design with the addition of steel hanger rods. The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in red with white trim.

Lititz Run joins the Conestoga River at this site.

==History==
The bridge was built in 1867 by Elias McMellen at a cost of $4,500. In 1972 it was destroyed as a result of flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes. Due to a tremendous response of area residents who signed a petition for its reconstruction, it was among the first covered bridges to be restored after Agnes. In the spring of 1973 the bridge was rebuilt by the nearby Amish. To prevent damage due to future flooding, they raised the bridge to above the average water line. However, the bridge was closed after flood damage sustained due to Tropical Storm Lee in 2011. The bridge was reopened in January 2014.

<text>The Risser&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge or Horst&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge was a covered bridge that spanned Little Chickie&#x27;s Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was burnt by an arsonist on July 8, 2002. The arsonist was caught and arrested by police. But the covered bridge had been completely destroyed and Risser&#x27;s Mill Covered Bridge across the Little Chiques Creek was never seen again. As of October 2006, a concrete bridge is being built 100 feet north of the site of the bridge. Plans exist to rebuild a replica of the bridge on the original hand-laid stone bridge abutments.
The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-36. Added in 1980, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80004612, and was removed from the Register on December 5, 2003.

== History ==
The bridge was built in 1872 by Elias McMellen using a Burr arch truss design.

<text>The Red Run Covered Bridge or Oberhaltzer&#x27;s Covered Bridge is a covered bridge that once spanned the Muddy Creek in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was built in 1866 by Elias McMellen and is currently situated on private property next to the Red Run Campground. It is 107 feet long with a width of 15 feet and is also known as the Oberholzer&#x27;s Covered Bridge.

The bridge has a single span, wooden, double Burr arch trusses design. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on the outside. Both approaches to the bridge are painted in the traditional white color.

The 107 foot long Red Run Covered Bridge is located at Red Run Campground and is on private property but it can easily be seen from the road. Built in 1866, this covered bridge is being used as a storage unit, this could be called a covered bridge to nowhere because the waters of Muddy Creek were diverted around the covered bridge in such a way that no water flows under its peers, another reason why this could be called a covered bridge to nowhere is because this covered bridge was replaced with a concrete span in 1961, a landlocked covered bridge is an ominous sight, and it can be imagined ghosts haunt here on Halloween.

The bridge&#x27;s WGCB Number is 38-36-10. Added in 1980, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as structure number 80003539. It is located at (40.17617, -76.08333).

<text>Aerolíneas Argentinas, formally &quot;Aerolíneas Argentinas S.A.&quot;, is the state-owned flag carrier of Argentina, and the country&#x27;s largest airline. The airline was created in 1949, from the merger of Aeroposta Argentina (AA), Aviación del Litoral Fluvial Argentino (ALFA), Flota Aérea Mercante Argentina (FAMA), and Zonas Oeste y Norte de Aerolíneas Argentinas (ZONDA), and started operations in December 1950. A consortium led by Iberia took control of the airline in 1990, and Grupo Marsans acquired the company and its subsidiaries in 2001, following a period of severe financial difficulties that put the airline on the brink of closure. The airline was renationalized in late 2008. It has its headquarters in Buenos Aires. The airline joined the SkyTeam alliance in August 2012; the airline&#x27;s cargo division became a member of SkyTeam Cargo in November 2013.

Aerolíneas Argentinas and its former sister company Austral Líneas Aéreas operate from two hubs, both located in Buenos Aires: Aeroparque Jorge Newbery and Ministro Pistarini International Airport. Its narrow-body fleet, used on domestic and regional routes, consists of the Brazilian-made Embraer 190, as well as the Boeing 737-700, -800 and MAX 8, whereas intercontinental and transoceanic services are flown on the wide-body Airbus A330-200.

==History==
===Early years to privatization===

The history of the airline began in 1929, when Compagnie Générale Aéropostale (Aéropostale) started airmail operations between Buenos Aires and Asunción using Laté-25 equipment, later expanding its network to cities located in Patagonia. Many French pilots (including aviator and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry) flew for the company in its beginnings. Argentine personnel replaced the Frenchmen as they gradually withdrew from the airline, and shortly after Aéropostale&#x27;s Argentine subsidiary Aeroposta Argentina was formed. In 1947, this airline became a mixed-stock company in which the government had a 20% stake and private investors held the balance. As Aeroposta expanded its network southwards and incorporated the Douglas DC-3 into its fleet, another three mixed-stock companies were in operation at the time: ALFA mainly operated flying boats northwards to the Mesopotamia, FAMA operated overseas services with DC-4s as its mainstay equipment, and ZONDA was mainly concerned with operations in the northwest region. These carriers became unprofitable and President Juan Perón had them amalgamated into a single state-owned company on 14 May 1949. The state holding was officially rebranded as Aerolíneas Argentinas-Empresa del Estado. The four companies comprising the state holding ceased independent operations on 31 December 1949.
Aerolíneas Argentinas started operations on its own on 7 December 1950. In February 1950, almost 10 months prior to the start of operations, five new Convairs were already acquired. As early as 1950, the Douglas DC-6 was added to the fleet, and was used to launch a weekly Buenos Aires–Rio de Janeiro–Natal–Dakar–Lisbon–Paris–Frankfurt flight in late 1950. Soon afterwards, Douglas DC-4s joined the fleet and services were inaugurated to Santiago de Chile, Lima, Santa Cruz, and São Paulo. By March 1953, the airline&#x27;s network was long, flown with DC-3s, DC-4s, DC-6s, Convair-Liner 240s, and Short Sandringhams. The company carried 291,988 passengers in 1954, and 327,808 in 1955. On 8 February 1957, it was reported that Aerolíneas Argentinas had ordered ten F-27 Friendships. The Comet had begun commercial jet services in the 1950s, and the carrier once again set the pace among the South American airlines, when Aerolíneas&#x27; president A. Cdre. Juan José Güiraldes persuaded Argentina&#x27;s President Arturo Frondizi to buy six of them, becoming the first overseas airline in ordering the type. The first of these aircraft departed Hatfield Aerodrome on 2 March 1959; over 18 hours were needed for it to cover a distance of between Hatfield and Buenos Aires. On 7 March, she was christened &quot;Las Tres Marías&quot; by Frondizi&#x27;s wife Elena Faggionato at Ezeiza Airport. Comet flights to New York City began in May 1959.
In the early 1960s, the fleet consisted of four Comet 4s, four Convair 240s, 15 DC-3s, six DC-4s, five DC-6s and six Sandringhams, whereas the ten F-27s ordered in 1957 were still pending delivery. The 1960s saw the carrier ordering the Avro 748 turboprop airliner. The aircraft started services on 15 February 1962 between Buenos Aires and Punta del Este. The first flight for the Caravelle in Aerolíneas colors was Buenos Aires–Santiago de Chile on 1 April 1962. At April 1965 the carrier had 5,960 employees, and the fleet consisted of three Comet 4s, one Comet 4C, three Caravelles, 12 DC-3s (three of them freighters), six DC-4s, three DC-6s and 12 HS-748s. In 1966, loans granted by the Ex-Im Bank and Boeing permitted the purchase of a number of Boeing 707-320Bs in a deal worth . In November 1969, the carrier entered a pool agreement with Lufthansa covering services between Germany and Argentina.
By March 1970, Aerolíneas Argentinas had a fleet of six Boeing 707s that served routes to Europe and the United States, three Caravelles 6Rs and four Comet 4s that flew regional services, and 12 HS-748s that flew domestically, whereas six Boeing 737-200s were on order. During the decade, the fleet had the arrival of three different aircraft types from Boeing: the 727—the first example entered the fleet in December 1977 on lease from Hughes AirWest and three more were ordered directly from Boeing — the 737, and the 747. The incorporation of the Fokker F-28 into the fleet in the mid-1970s, prompted the withdrawal of the last HS-748s, making the company to be the first South American airline in operating an all-jet aircraft park. Frankfurt, Madrid, and Rome became the first destinations to be served with the new 747s, starting January 1977. Another milestone for the company took place in June 1980, with the first south polar scheduled service, linking Buenos Aires with Hong Kong via Auckland. Late that year, a second-hand Boeing 747SP was acquired from Braniff for .
The airline was assigned by law the monopoly of international operations from Argentina in 1971. This meant no other Argentine airline was able to operate international flights, let alone the already created Austral. The carrier therefore became the flag carrier of the country. The same law also assigned Aerolíneas Argentinas a 50% share of the domestic market.

Following the acquisition of Austral by the Argentine government in 1980, both Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral became government-owned, to the extent that some routes were simultaneously operated, even using similar equipment. However, a state of continuous tension existed over salary differences between both companies that eventually led the Aerolíneas Argentinas&#x27; pilots to a three-week-long strike that started on 1 July 1986. During this strike, the government leased pilots from the Argentine Air Force to operate some aircraft. Other companies took advantage of this situation and gained the market share that Aerolíneas Argentinas lost, as domestic routes were operated by Austral, LADE, and LAPA, and the government temporarily authorized foreign carriers to exploit the company&#x27;s international routes.

Using a Boeing 747-200, the airline operated the first transantarctic commercial flight on 7 June 1980. During and shortly after the Falklands War in 1982, the airline was banned from British airspace. A flight from London-Gatwick to Argentina&#x27;s capital was once scheduled, but because of the ban, passengers bound to Argentina had to change planes at Madrid-Barajas.

At March 1985, Aerolíneas Argentinas had 9,822 employees. At this time, the fleet comprised one Boeing 707-320B, one Boeing 707-320C, seven Boeing 727-200s, 10 Boeing 737-200s, two Boeing 737-200Cs, five Boeing 747-200Bs, one Boeing 747SP, two Fokker F28-1000s, and a Fokker F28-4000. The international network radiated from Buenos Aires and served Asuncion, Auckland, Bogotá, Cape Town, Caracas, Frankfurt, Guayaquil, Hong Kong, La Paz, Lima, Los Angeles, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Montevideo, Montreal, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Santiago, Porto Alegre, and Zürich. Sydney was first served in 1989, and flights to London resumed in January 1990.

===Privatisation: 1990–2008===

The privatisation of the airline started being considered under the government of Raúl Alfonsín, when SAS was proposed to become a 40% shareholder of the state company. This was firmly resisted by the Peronist opposition. The staff had grown to 10,372 by March 1990. Late this year a consortium led by Iberia and Austral&#x27;s owner Cielos del Sur S.A. acquired an 85% stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas for in cash, the same amount to be injected within a 10-month period, and a debt-equity exchange worth  billion. Another consortium led by Alitalia, American Airlines, KLM and Varig had earlier pulled out from the process. Paradoxically, one of the first actions taken by the new Peronist government was to privatise the carrier, after airily opposing to the privatisation propositions of its predecessor. The sale of the airline followed the divestiture of the government shareholding in the national telephone company, which also took place in 1990 during the Carlos Menem presidency&#x27;s privatization wave, intended to divest the participation of the state in a number of enterprises to reduce the US$40 billion debt to foreign banks by  billion. Aimed at favoring the privatization process, the government absorbed a  million debt the company took between 1981 and 1982 for capitalization purposes. Despite the carrier being regarded as overstaffed and bureaucratic, it was debt-free at that time, having an average profitability of  million a year; it actually had  million in revenues for the year prior to the privatization. The privatization contract, which specified the buyer should pay  million in cash and  million in external debt bonds, was ratified by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, a clause enabled the buyer to indebt Aerolíneas Argentinas for the buyout process; this was reflected in the airline&#x27;s 1991 balance, which included debts worth  million for its own acquisition. This privatization process was not ruled as illegal until 2009.
Austral&#x27;s owner Cielos del Sur S.A. was sold to Iberia in March 1991, further increasing the Spanish flag carrier&#x27;s stake in the Argentine air market. Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral never merged throughout the private era, and remained as separate companies with the same shareholder. Iberia subsequently boosted its stake in the airline to 85% in April 1994 after a cash injection. Out of the remaining 15%, the Argentine government held the 5% stake it was initially assigned, while 10% belonged to the employees. Furthermore, at this stage the Argentine government resigned to the voting privilege it had in the directory of the airline. Iberia was subsequently obliged by the European Commission to cut its stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas as a condition for receiving state aid. It thence reduced its participation to 20%, transferring the remaining 65% to Interinvest/Andes holding, a consortium comprising the Spanish government holding company (SEPI) – the actual owner of Iberia before it was privatised in 2001 – and banks Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust, among others. In July 1997, Iberia cut again its stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas from 20% to 10%, while American Airlines&#x27;s parent company AMR acquired a 10% stake of Aerolineas Argentinas/Austral&#x27;s major stockholder Interinvest, equivalent to a participation of 8.5% in both Argentine companies, with the commitment of finding investors for Aerolíneas Argentinas. AMR&#x27;s 8.5% operation was finally cleared by the United States Department of Justice in early July 1998. By that time, the Argentine government still owned a 5% stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas. Losses had mounted to  million since 1992, totaling  million only for 1999. The restructuring plan presented by AMR, mainly aimed at reverting these losses, was rejected by the SEPI. Furthermore, given that the AMR Corporation did not find purchasers for the company, the SEPI put the control of the airline back into Spanish hands. The vacancy left in the management positions that followed the departure of the AMR holding from Aerolíneas was soon filled in by the SEPI. To protect the interests of the Argentine national carrier, the government suspended an open skies agreement between Argentina and the United States that would come into force in September 2000.

The airline had 5,384 employees at March 2000. At this time, the aircraft park consisted of two Airbus A310-300s, four Airbus A340-200s, four Boeing 737-200s, Boeing 737-200 Advanced, one Boeing 737-200C, and nine Boeing 747-200Bs, whereas six Airbus A340-600s were on order. The list of international destinations served at the time was Asunción, Auckland, Bogotá, Cancún, Caracas, Florianópolis, Lima, Madrid, Mexico City, Miami, Montevideo, New York, Orlando, Paris, Punta del Este, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Santiago, São Paulo, and Sydney; domestic services to Catamarca, Comodoro Rivadavia, Córdoba, Corrientes, Esquel, Iguazú, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mar del Plata, Mendoza, Neuquén, Posadas, Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña, Resistencia, Rio Gallegos, Río Grande, Rosario, Salta, San Carlos de Bariloche, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero, Trelew, Tucuman, Ushuaia, and Villa Gesell were also operated.
Allegations of corruption were made on the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm&#x27;s ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline paying the price for its own purchase with its assets. Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove Aerolíneas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001. In June 2001, the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors, and went into administration; the salaries were paid by the Argentine government, instead of using money coming from the SEPI. The payment of salaries for the upcoming months was suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat. On 6 June, flights to Auckland, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro were halted. Owing to a  million debt with the fuel supplier, the suspension of the daily flight to Madrid, which also served Rome and was the last connection with Europe, followed a week later. After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.

Marsans group acquired a 92% stake through its subsidiary Air Comet from the SEPI in late 2001, and committed to inject  million capital with the intention of resuming short– as well as long–haul services. The resumption of international flights started in early November 2001. At July 2002, the airline and its subsidiaries employed 7,090. The company exited bankruptcy in January 2003, and emerged from administration a month later. That year, the first profit in five years was announced, along with an important increase in market share.

===Renationalisation: 2008–onwards===
In May 2008, an initial agreement between the Argentine government and Grupo Marsans in which the latter would decrease its participation in the airline to 35% was announced; in reducing their holding, Marsans would make room for new private investors, as well as for the government of Argentina to increase its stake in the airline from 5 to 20%. Amid accusations from Marsans and following the disclosure of an agreement, the Argentine government took the airline back under state control in July 2008, after acquiring 99.4% of the stake for an undisclosed price; the remaining 0.6% continued being owned by the company&#x27;s employees. 

At this time, the company had 40% of its fleet grounded. The act renationalizing Aerolíneas Argentinas and its subsidiary Austral Líneas Aéreas was passed by the Chamber of Deputies in August 2008, and became law in September 2008 following the 46–21 vote in the Argentine Senate. There were disagreements regarding the value to be paid by Grupo Marsans to the government. Negotiations fell through, and an administrator was appointed by an Argentine court in that year to oversee the running of the company. A vote by both the lower and the upper houses of the Argentine Congress in support of taking over the company and its subsidiaries took place in , when the Chamber of Deputies voted 152–84 in favor of the expropriation, and the Senate approved the bill by a 42–20 vote.

In September 2011, the airline emerged from the reorganization proceedings it had filed in 2001. In late November 2011, the government announced an austerity plan for the company to reduce the deficit it has been incurring since being taken over from Marsans; the plan included the revision of unprofitable routes, the reduction of pilot/aircraft pay rates, and the abandonment of obsolete equipment, among others.

Passenger traffic for the group reached a record 8.5 million in 2013, a 57% increase from the time of its renationalization in 2008. Revenues rose to a record of US$2 billion in 2013, an 85% increase from 2008 levels; losses likewise declined from $860 million (78% of revenues) to $250 million (12% of revenues). Corporate assets as of 2012 had tripled to over $1.6 billion, as the group&#x27;s fleet grew from 26 to 63 planes and the average age of same was reduced from 20 years to 7.5. In 2017, projections for 2018 were given at 14.5 million passengers and a loss of $90 million.

Between 2008 and 2021, Aerolíneas Argentinas received over $8 billion USD in subsidy from the Argentine government.

=== Proposed privatization under Javier Milei ===
Following the election of Javier Milei as president of Argentina in 2023, he affirmed his intention to privatize the airline again. Under his proposal, shares in the airline would be handed over by the state to its workers along with an end in state support for the airline. Unions have expressed opposition to the proposal with one union head promising violence before apologizing. Workers have also gone on strike over the issue. On 21 December 2023, Milei announced a presidential decree to begin the process of privatization and transfer of shares, likely to employees. He would also implement open skies policies including cabotage to improve competitiveness.

===Recent developments===

Aerolíneas Argentinas began to modernise its fleet in 2009, when it agreed to lease 10 Boeing 737-700s and to purchase two more of these aircraft that would act as a replacement for the ageing Boeing 737-200s and MD-80s. Along with the first leased ones, the two brand new aircraft, which became the first ones acquired by the company in 17 years, were incorporated into the fleet in mid-2009. In October 2009, the carrier had announced it was looking for about six Boeing 737-800 aircraft, both to complement the 12 Boeing 737-700s and to replace the ageing Boeing 737-500s. In November, the Boeing 737-200 made its last flight on a scheduled Buenos Aires–Catamarca–La Rioja–Buenos Aires passenger service. In late November 2010, the airline agreed to lease a further ten aircraft of the –700 series from ILFC, which started being delivered in April 2011. , the airline was considering both the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 787-9 as replacement aircraft for the long-haul fleet. The incorporation of leased Airbus A330-200s in 2013 for serving routes to Bogotá, Cancún, Caracas and Miami was also planned, whereas an increased maximum takeoff weight version of the same type was also under consideration to partly replace the Airbus A340-200s by 2016.

In April 2013, Air Lease Corporation announced the lease of six Boeing 737-800s to the company, with deliveries starting in November 2014; in May 2013, CIT Group announced the lease of four additional aircraft of the same type, with deliveries starting in January 2014. In the same year, an agreement for the acquisition of 20 more aircraft of the type, worth  billion, was announced. In addition to the lease of four used Airbus A330-200s from ILFC —the first of them delivered in September 2013— Aerolíneas Argentinas signed in a memorandum of understanding with Airbus, aimed at acquiring four more aircraft of the type. In a transaction worth  million, the order was firmed up in February 2014. These aircraft will be fitted with GE Aviation CF6-80E1 engines. The first Airbus A330-200 directly purchased from Airbus was delivered in March 2015.

With its ageing long-haul fleet in need of replacement, Aerolineas CEO Mario Dell’Acqua stated in November 2017 that the company was evaluating a replacement for the Airbus A340, with a decision to be made in 2018. The company was considering either the Boeing 787 or the Airbus A350 as possible replacements, with the intention of the new fleet entering service in 2020. The Airbus A330 will also be replaced as part of the long-haul fleet replacement, though they are to be retired progressively after the A340s. In November 2017, Aerolíneas Argentinas became the first Latin American airline in taking delivery of a Boeing 737 MAX 8; the aircraft flew its first revenue service on the Buenos Aires-Ezeiza–Mendoza route.

===Livery===
In June 2010, Aerolíneas Argentinas revamped its image to give the airline a more modern appearance. The new logo is a combination of light blue and grey colours. Likewise, the previous eurowhite livery is replaced with a combination of the Argentine flag colours plus grey. Subsidiary airline Austral also adopted this new livery, additionally including a red cheatline.

==Accidents and incidents==
According to the Aviation Safety Network database, the last fatal accident at the airline was in 1970. As of June 2023, Aviation Safety Network records 47 accidents or incidents for Aerolíneas Argentinas since it started operations in 1950. The company ranks among the safest airlines in the world.

<doc id="85201" wikidata="Q659976" url="?curid=85201" title="Ramzi bin al-Shibh">
<text>Ramzi Mohammed Abdullah bin al-Shibh (; born May 1, 1972) is a Yemeni terrorist who served as al-Qaeda&#x27;s communications officer. He has been detained by the United States in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp (NSGB) since 2002. He is accused of being a &quot;key facilitator&quot; for the September 11 attacks in 2001.

In the mid-1990s, bin al-Shibh moved as a student to Hamburg, Germany, where he allegedly became close friends with Mohamed Atta, Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al-Shehhi. Together, they are suspected of forming the Hamburg cell and becoming central perpetrators of the September 11 attacks. He was the only one of the four who failed to obtain a U.S. visa; he is accused of acting as an intermediary for the hijackers in the United States, by wiring money and passing on information from key al-Qaeda figures. After the attacks, bin al-Shibh was the first to be publicly identified by the U.S. as the &quot;20th hijacker&quot;, for whom there have been several more possible candidates.

Bin al-Shibh has been in United States custody since he was captured on September 11, 2002, in Karachi, Pakistan. He was held by the CIA in black sites in Morocco before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in September 2006. Finally charged in 2008 before a military commission, he and several others suspected in the 9/11 attacks went to trial beginning in May 2012. In August 2023 a U.S. military judge ruled him too psychologically damaged to defend himself after CIA torture.

==Early life==
Ramzi bin al-Shibh was born on May 1, 1972 in Ghayl Ba Wazir, Hadhramaut, South Yemen. When he was young, his family moved to a working-class neighborhood in the capital, Sana&#x27;a. In 1987, his father died. He was cared for by his older brother, Ahmed, and his mother.

In 1987, while still in high school, bin al-Shibh began working part-time as a clerk for the International Bank of Yemen. He continued working there until 1995.

Bin al-Shibh applied for a U.S. visa in 1995, but his request was denied. He instead went to Germany, where he requested political asylum, claiming that he was a political refugee from Sudan. He lived in Hamburg until 1997, when a judge refused his asylum request.

Bin al-Shibh returned to the Hadramaut region of Yemen. A short while later he received a German visa under his real name. While he was in Germany, bin al-Shibh used the name Ramzi Omar. In 1997, bin al-Shibh met Mohamed Atta at a mosque; he was the leader of the Hamburg cell. For two years, Atta and bin al-Shibh were roommates in Germany.

==Connections to 9/11 attacks==
In late 1999, bin al-Shibh traveled to Kandahar in Afghanistan, where he received training at al-Qaeda camps and met others involved in planning the September 11 attacks.

Original plans for the 9/11 attacks called for bin al-Shibh to be one of the hijacker pilots, along with three other members of the Hamburg cell, including Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah. From Hamburg, bin al-Shibh applied to take flight training in the United States. At that time, he also applied to Aviation Language Services, which provides language training for student pilots. Bin al-Shibh applied four times for an entry visa to the United States and was refused each time. He made visa applications in Germany on May 17, 2000, and again in June, on September 16, and October 25, 2000.

According to the 9/11 Commission, this refusal of a visa was motivated by general concern by U.S. officials at the time that people from Yemen, which was struggling economically, would illegally overstay their visit and seek work in the United States. His friend, Zakariyah Essabar, was also denied visas. After failing to gain a visa to enter the United States, bin al-Shibh took on a &quot;coordinator&quot; role in the plot, serving as a link between Atta in the United States and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Afghanistan. Bin al-Shibh was the first to be publicly identified by the United States as the &quot;20th hijacker,&quot; someone who was thought to have been tasked to fill out the single missing slot among the four terrorist five-person teams. This spot was never filled. United Airlines Flight 93 had four hijackers, not five, which is believed in part to have led to the success of the passenger revolt ⁠ ⁠—  the crash of the plane near Shanksville, Pennsylvania was likely caused by the passengers.

Al-Shibh interacted extensively with the hijackers. In August 2000, Ziad Jarrah tried to enroll bin al-Shibh in a Florida flight school. Bin al-Shibh sent money via wire transfer on September 25, 2000, to Marwan al-Shehhi in Florida. In August 2001, bin al-Shibh sent approximately $14,000 to Zacarias Moussaoui, using the alias &quot;Ahad Sabet&quot;, a few days after receiving transfer of $15,000 from Hashim Abdulrahman in the United Arab Emirates.

According to the Al Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Top Secret: The Road to September 11&quot;, three weeks prior to the attacks, Saeed al-Ghamdi is believed to have used the name &quot;Abdul Rahman&quot; to message bin al-Shibh online (who was posing as a girlfriend), writing a reference to two military/governmental targets and two civilian targets, 19 hijackers and 4 hijacked planes:

The first semester commences in three weeks. Two high schools and two universities. ... This summer will surely be hot ...19 certificates for private education and four exams. Regards to the professor. Goodbye.

Bin al-Shibh later said that Mohamed Atta had phoned him on the morning of August 29 to give a similar coded message revealing the date of the attacks.

==Other terrorism activities==
After January 14, 2002, bin al-Shibh was featured among five suspected al-Qaeda members on videos delivering what United States Attorney General John Ashcroft described as &quot;martyrdom messages from suicide terrorists.&quot; NBC News said that the five videos had been recorded after the September 11 attacks.

Ashcroft said the five videotapes, shown by the FBI without sound, had been recovered from the rubble of the home of Mohammad Atef outside Kabul, Afghanistan. Ashcroft called upon people worldwide to help &quot;identify, locate and incapacitate terrorists who are suspected of planning additional attacks against innocent civilians.&quot; The sound was left out to guard against the possibility that the messages contained signals for other terrorists. Ashcroft added that an analysis of the audio suggested &quot;the men may be trained and prepared to commit future suicide terrorist acts.&quot; Ashcroft said not much was known about any of them except bin al-Shibh. The other three are still featured in compiled video clips, in order of appearance, Muhammad Sa&#x27;id Ali Hasan, Abd al-Rahim, and Khalid Ibn Muhammad al-Juhani. The fifth was identified a week later as Abderraouf Jdey, alias Al-Rauf bin al-Habib bin Yousef al-Jiddi.

On September 8, 2006, al-Qaeda released a video that shows Osama bin Laden and some of the 9/11 hijackers. The tape identifies bin al-Shibh as the &quot;coordinator of the 9/11 attacks&quot; in its English subtitles. The video shows bin al-Shibh and other hijackers training in kickboxing, as well as disarming and concealing weapons at a terrorist training camp in or near Kandahar, Afghanistan.

On January 17, 2002, the FBI published the first Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information list (now known as the FBI Seeking Information – Terrorism list). They identified the five wanted terrorists, about whom little was known but who were suspected of plotting additional terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations. (see current version displaying photos of five terrorists on the remaining martyrdom videos FBI list, as of June 2006) Ramzi bin al-Shibh was one of the four men among the five whose names were known.

Ramzi bin al-Shibh is suspected of having been involved in the 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, and the 2002 Ghriba synagogue bombing in Tunisia.

==Capture and detention==
Bin al-Shibh was captured in Pakistan on September 11, 2002, after a gun battle in Karachi with the Pakistani ISI and the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division. On September 14, 2002, he was transferred to the United States. CIA officers transported him by extraordinary rendition to a secret black site in Morocco for interrogation. The CIA admitted in August 2010 that it has video tapes of these interrogations.

His profile was removed from the FBI Seeking Information wanted list by October 17, 2002. Bin al-Shibh was held by the U.S. at an undisclosed CIA-led location until September 2006. On September 6, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush announced that bin al-Shibh and thirteen other CIA-held, high-value detainees had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

Bin al-Shibh is also wanted by German courts; he had shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohamed Atta, the suspected ringleader of the September 11 hijackers. In 2005, the USA denied a German request for bin al-Shibh&#x27;s extradition. In an earlier extradition and trial, Abdelghani Mzoudi, a 9/11 suspect, was acquitted of German charges.

On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008), that detainees had the right to access the federal court system in &quot;habeas&quot; challenges to their detention. It ruled that the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which had restricted their exercise of habeas corpus outside the military commission system, was unconstitutional in this respect. The first 22 captives who had pending habeas petitions in 2006 when the Act was passed, were allowed to re-initiate their petitions in August 2008.

===Guantanamo military commission===
Bin al-Shibh and four other captives classified as high value detainees (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, Ammar al-Baluchi and Walid Bin Attash) were charged in Guantanamo military commissions in Spring 2008. The men triggered controversy when they announced that they did not want US-appointed attorneys and they planned to boycott their commissions. The military commissions, as authorized by President George W. Bush, did not permit suspects to forgo legal representation, to act as their own attorneys, or to boycott their commissions. The commissions authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006, did authorize suspects to serve as their own attorneys.

The other four men eventually agreed to attend their commissions. Bin al-Shibh, however, has continued to refuse to attend. His appointed attorneys had expressed concern about him and his state of mental health. The top-secret location of Camp 7, where the high-value detainees are held, had been off limits to military attorneys. The individual detainees are hooded when they travel from the camp to their commission hearings.

Suzanne Lachelier, one of the attorneys and a reserve officer in the Judge Advocate General Corps, offered to wear a hood, in order to be taken to him when the camp authorities initially refused her examination of the prison. She finally gained approval from the military commission judge to see the prison in the autumn of 2008. To get to the prison, Lachelier and her co-counsel, Rich Federico, were taken in a windowless van that was used to transport detainees. They were the first defense lawyers to visit Camp 7.

The judge presiding over the commission&#x27;s pre-trial motions ordered bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi to undergo mental competency hearings. On December 8, 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he, along with the other four men who had been indicted, wished to confess and plead guilty; however, they wished to delay their plea until after the competency hearings of bin al-Shibh and Hawsawi, because all five men wanted to make their pleas together.

On May 17, 2010, &quot;Saba News&quot; reported that Ramzi Al-Shaibah and four other Yemenis would face charges in the summer of 2010. Two other Yemenis to face charges were: Walid Bin Atash and Abdul Rahim Al-Nasheri. &quot;Saba News&quot; did not name the fourth and fifth individuals.

In 2011, the lawyers of Bin al-Shibh argued that he may be unfit to stand trial and participate in his own defense. They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four co-accused be stayed until his mental state is determined. They say he has been prescribed psychotropic drugs of the sort that are used to treat schizophrenia. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.

In October 2012, the U.S. began the trials of al-Shibh and the other four 9/11 defendants. On January 31, 2014, Carol Rosenberg, reporting in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, wrote that Pohl had to delay al-Shibh&#x27;s trial again, because the panel of three military psychiatrists who tried to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial had not been able to reach a conclusion. Al-Shibh had not been prepared to answer the doctor&#x27;s questions. On August 24, 2023, Al-Shibh was declared unfit to stand trial by a U.S. tribunal due to his mental state, after lawyers argued &#x27;CIA torture made him delusional and psychotic&#x27;.

<text>Mitta Mitta River, a perennial river and a direct tributary of the Murray River within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Alpine district of Victoria, Australia.

The name Mitta Mitta derives from the Aboriginal word &quot;mida-modoenga&quot;, meaning reeds called modunga.

==Course==
The river rises below Mount Bogong, the highest mountain in the Victorian Alps, with the Mitta Mitta River forming at the confluence of the Cobungra River and the Big River, just south of Anglers Rest, flowing generally north, joined by twenty-four minor tributaries including the Dart River, before reaching its mouth with the Murray River, east of Albury at Lake Hume. The river descends over its course of .

The Mitta Mitta River is the source of approximately 10% of the Murray&#x27;s flow. Along the Mitta Mitta River, mean annual flow can triple from Hinnomunjie in the south to Tallangatta in the north. Highest flows are in October and are attributable to the spring snow melt. The flow of the Mitta Mitta River is heavily modified and impounded by Dartmouth Dam and Hume Dam, both major water reservoirs. Upstream of Dartmouth Dam, the river flows swiftly through near-pristine forest. Below the dam, it travels more sedately through flatter, cleared farming country. The original junction of the Mitta Mitta River with the Murray River is now submerged beneath the waters of Lake Hume for a large part of the time.

The catchment area of the Mitta Mitta River is estimated as .

The river valley used to flood on a nearly annual basis, but the completion of Dartmouth Dam in the 1970s largely eliminated the floods.

The river flows through a valley that contains four small towns: Mitta Mitta, Eskdale, Dartmouth. Mitta Mitta is a small hamlet at the confluence of the River and Snowy Creek.

==Recreation==
For the fisherman, the Mitta Mitta River is a good source for trout, particularly brown trout and the occasional rainbow trout.

The Mitta Mitta River upstream of Hinnomunjie Bridge is a favourite for white water enthusiasts, with one licensed company operating commercial facilities. The river is also frequented by recreational kayakers as a single or multi day trip with a grade between II and IV.

<text>In Roman mythology, Dea Tacita (&quot;the silent goddess&quot;) also known as Dea Muta or Muta Tacita, was a goddess of the dead. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; includes a passage describing a rite propitiating Dea Tacita in order to &quot;seal up hostile mouths / and unfriendly tongue&quot; at Feralia on 21 February. Dea Tacita is the same as the naiad Larunda. According to Ovid this occurred because Dea Tacita had her tongue ripped off by Jupiter. Jupiter was angry with her because she told the nymph Juturna to flee from him because he planned to rape her. In this guise, Dea Tacita was worshipped at a festival called Larentalia on 23 December. Goddesses &quot;Mutae Tacitae&quot; were invoked to destroy a hated person: in an inscription from Cambodunum in Raetia, someone asks &quot;ut mutus sit Quartus&quot; and &quot;erret fugiens ut mus&quot; (&quot;that Quartus be mute&quot; and that he &quot;wander, fleeing, like a mouse&quot;). Plutarch, who described Tacita as a Muse, states that Numa Pompilius credited Tacita for his oracular insight and taught the Romans to worship her.

<text>Dea Dia (Latin: &quot;Goddess of Daylight&quot;, or &quot;Bright Goddess&quot;) was a goddess of fertility and growth in ancient Roman religion. She was sometimes identified with Ceres, and sometimes with her Greek equivalent Demeter.

She was worshiped during Ambarvalia, a festival to Ceres. Every May, her priests, the Fratres Arvales, held a three-day festival in her honor.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Dea Dīa&quot; () means &#x27;Goddess of Daylight&#x27; or &#x27;Bright Goddess&#x27;. The first element stems from the Latin &quot;dea&quot; (&#x27;goddess&#x27;), while the second is related to &quot;diēs&quot; (&#x27;day&#x27;), probably in reference to the ritual prescription to announce in January the May ceremonies &quot;sub divo culmine&quot; (&#x27;under the celestial vault&#x27;).

<doc id="85218" wikidata="Q3495260" url="?curid=85218" title="Disciplina">
<text>In Roman mythology, Disciplina was a minor deity and the personification of discipline. The word &quot;disciplina&quot; itself, a Latin noun, is multi-faceted in meaning; it refers to education and training, self-control and determination, knowledge in a field of study, and an orderly way of life. Being disciplined in duties is to give example of what is taught, a Roman believes that what is taught is possible and learn from honored example best. The goddess embodied these qualities for her worshippers. She was commonly worshipped by imperial Roman soldiers, particularly those who lived along the borders of the Roman Empire; altars to her have been found in Great Britain and North Africa. The fort of Cilurnum along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was dedicated to the goddess Disciplina, as witnessed by an extant dedicatory inscription on a stone altar found in 1978. 

Her chief virtues were &quot;frugalitas, severitas&quot; and &quot;fidelis&quot;—frugality, sternness, and faithfulness. In worshiping Disciplina, a soldier became frugal in every way: with money, with energy and actions. The virtue of &quot;severitas&quot; was shown in his focused, determined, not easily dissuaded, and decisive behavior. He was faithful to his unit, his army, the officers and the Roman people. Seneca expresses cruelty is the opposite of severitas, severitas is a managed virtue, without which strictness of discipline may turn to cruelty, crudity and oppression.

<doc id="85220" wikidata="Q5283763" url="?curid=85220" title="Dius Fidius">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Dius Fidius (less often as Dius Fidus) was a god of oaths associated with Jupiter. His name was thought to be related to Fides.

&quot;Fidius&quot; may be an earlier form for &quot;filius&quot;, &quot;son&quot;, with the name Dius Fidius originally referring to Hercules as a son of Jupiter. According to some writers, the phrase &quot;medius fidius&quot; was equivalent to &quot;mehercule&quot; &quot;My Hercules!&quot;, a common interjection.

==Theology==
Varro states that his teacher Aelius Stilo called this god &quot;Diovis filium&quot;, i.e. &quot;Dius Filius&quot; as the Greek &quot;Διόσκορον Castorem&quot; on the grounds of the alteration of the letters &quot;d&quot; and &quot;l&quot; in the Sabine tongue. He identified him in Sabine, Sancus and in Greek, Hercules. This assumption is not linguistically correct, because in the Iguvine Tables the god is named &quot;Fis(i)us&quot; or &quot;Fisovius Sancius&quot;. However, his interpretation, based on unknown theological documents, tallies with that of some modern scholars. The god, at some points, was certainly not a mere aspect of Jupiter but a separate entity, known in Rome for some time as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Wissowa argues that Jupiter and Dius Fidius divide responsibility for ensuring good faith. The most important oaths are sworn by Jupiter, the god of the &quot;Fides Publica Populi Romani&quot; as &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot;. Dius Fidius protects good faith in private affairs: he corresponds to Ζευς Πίστιος. This view may well reflect a later development but is not the original interpretation. Dius Fidius was not confined to private &quot;fides&quot; in early times. Matters of public relevance (such as the first international treaty of Rome, the one with Gabii) were preserved in his shrine (put under his jurisdiction).

The shrine of Sancus had no roof, as it was deemed inappropriate and ineffective to swear oaths unless under the sky. The Capitoline temple also had an opening in its roof.

The association of Dius Fidius with Jupiter is divine filiation. Dumézil underlines the peculiar intertwining and mixing of Jupiter and Dius Fidius as wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts. Both require an opening in the roof of their temples while leaving unanswered for Dumézil the question of the true identity of the latter.

This functional overlap generated confusion about the identity of Sancus Dius Fidius among ancient and modern scholars, as Dius Fidius has sometimes been considered another theonym for Jupiter. However, the autonomy of Semo Sancus from Jupiter and the fact that Dius Fidius is an alternate theonym designating Semo Sancus (and not Jupiter) is shown by the name of the correspondent Umbrian god Fisus Sancius which compounds the two constituent parts of Sancus and Dius Fidius: in Umbrian and Sabine &quot;Fisus&quot; is the exact correspondent of &quot;Fidius&quot;, as e.g. Sabine &quot;Clausus&quot; of Latin &quot;Claudius&quot;.

The fact that Sancus as Jupiter is in charge of the observance of oaths, of the laws of hospitality and of loyalty (&quot;Fides&quot;) connects him with the sphere and values of sovereignty, i.e. in Dumézil&#x27;s terminology, of the first function.

Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the genius of Jupiter. W. W. Fowler cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and Sancus is a &quot;Genius Iovius&quot;, as it appears from the Iguvine Tables. The concept of a &quot;genius&quot; of a deity is attested only in the imperial period.

Theodor Mommsen, William Warde Fowler and Georges Dumézil among others rejected the tradition that ascribes a Sabine origin to the Roman cult of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, partly on linguistic grounds as the theonym is Latin and no mention or evidence of a Sabine &quot;Semo&quot; is found near Rome, while the &quot;Semones&quot; are attested in Latin in the carmen Arvale. In their view Sancus would be a deity who was shared by all ancient Italic peoples, whether Osco-Umbrian or Latino-Faliscan.

The details of the cult of Fisus Sancius at Iguvium and those of Fides at Rome, such as the use of the &quot;mandraculum&quot;, a piece of linen fabric covering the right hand of the officiant, and of the &quot;urfeta&quot; (&quot;orbita&quot;) or of the &quot;orbes ahenei&quot;, sort of small bronze disc brought in the right hand by the officiant at Iguvium and also deposed in the temple of Semo Sancus in 329 B.C. after an affair of treason confirm the parallelism.

Some aspects of Dius Fidius&#x27; oath ritual, such as requiring the open sky, the &quot;compluvium&quot; of private residences and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, implied to romanist O. Sacchi the idea that Dius Fidius&#x27; oath predated that for &quot;Iuppiter Lapis&quot; or &quot;Iuppiter Feretrius&quot;, and had its origin in prehistoric rituals, when the &quot;templum&quot; was in the open air and defined by natural landmarks such as the highest nearby tree. Supporting this interpretation is the explanation of the theonym Sancus as meaning &quot;sky&quot; in Sabine given by Johannes Lydus, an etymology that, however, is rejected by Dumézil, Briquel and others.

All the known details concerning Sancus connect him to the sphere of oaths, respect of compacts and the divine guarantee against their breach. These values are all proper to sovereign gods and in common with Jupiter (and with Mitra in Vedic religion).

<text>The Peruvian Aprista Party (, PAP) () is a Peruvian social-democratic political party and a member of the Socialist International. The party was founded as the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (, APRA) by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, who originally intended to create a network of anti-imperialist social and political movements in Latin America. Members are called &quot;compañeros&quot; (fellows), based on the fraternity espoused by Haya de la Torre. Originally a centre-left to left-wing party with democratic socialist and nationalist elements (in addition to the aforementioned anti-imperialism), the party moved closer to the political centre under the leadership of Alan García starting in the 1980s, embracing social democracy and later some Third Way policies. In 2006, the party adopted a new platform as García&#x27;s second presidency implemented a series of policies labelled as centre-right, embracing free-market capitalism, dialogue with other right-wing parties and organizations in the country, and closer ties with the Catholic Church and Evangelical churches.

Founded continentally in 1924 in Mexico City, Mexico, and nationally in 1930 in Lima, it is one of the oldest political parties in Latin America. Among the Peruvian political parties in activity, specifically for having been stripped of electoral victories by coups or military governments after having triumphed democratically, it also went through two long periods of illegality, both under military and civilian governments, having been persecuted by the presidencies of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro and Manuel A. Odría. The Peruvian Aprista Party has gained in the presidency in two occasions: in 1985 and 2006, both under the candidacy of Alan García. At parliamentary level, the party was represented uninterrupted from 1995 until 2020, falling below the electoral threshold to attain legislative representation.

Although APRA does not operate throughout Latin America as its founder envisioned for, it has served as a powerful influence for other progressive Latin American political organizations, such as Democratic Action (AD) in Venezuela and the Socialist Party of Chile.

==History==
=== 20th century ===
==== Original platform ====
APRA was founded by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre in Mexico City on 7 May 1924 with aspirations to becoming a continent-wide party, and it subsequently influenced a number of other Latin American political movements, including Bolivia&#x27;s Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (&quot;Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario&quot;, MNR), Dominican Republic&#x27;s Dominican Revolutionary Party (&quot;Partido Revolucionario Dominicano&quot;, PRD) and Costa Rica&#x27;s National Liberation Party (&quot;Partido Liberación Nacional&quot;, PLN). The party was inspired by Haya de la Torre&#x27;s observations of fascist and communist parties during his time in Europe. 

Initial supporters for APRA in the 1920s mainly included middle-class and wealthy Peruvians who were upset with the sugar industry&#x27;s modernization. It appealed to left-wing Peruvian intellectuals, as well as the nascent Peruvian labor movement. It is the oldest surviving political party in Peru and is as much a social phenomenon as a political movement, with a membership whose loyalty to the party has been unwavering for several generations. APRA initially espoused anti-imperialism, Pan-Americanism, international solidarity and economic nationalism. Years of repression and clandestinity, as well as Haya de la Torre&#x27;s single-handed dominance of the party, resulted in striking sectarian and hierarchical traits. The party&#x27;s structure and its hold over its rank and file proved more lasting than its original ideological platform.

In the 1930s, the party was banned after being inaccurately labeled as communist; Italy and the United States supported the ban as they believed APRA served as a front group for bolshevism. The conflict between APRA and the government of fascist president Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro led to civil war-like conditions. On 2 July 1932, APRA militants massacred sixty soldiers in Trujillo, which resulted in a violent response from President Sánchez Cerro that resulted with about 1,500 Apristas killed and the arrest of Haya de la Torre. Abelardo Mendoza Leyva, an Aprista, later assassinated President Sánchez Cerro on 30 April 1933. 

==== Move to the right ====
In 1944, APRA formed the National Democratic Front political coalition beside the far-right Reformist Democratic Party and the fascist Revolutionary Union party, excluding the Peruvian Communist Party. The alliance led to the triumph of ultraconservative José Luis Bustamante y Rivero becoming president the same year. By the 1950s, APRA would become a right-wing party according to PBS, leaving many of its left-wing supporters disillusioned.

After several years of military rule, APRA was allowed to participate as a legal political party in 1979. The party gathered strong support from the electorate, managing to win a majority of seats in the newly created Constituent Assembly, and supervised the first democratic elections in 12 years.

Haya de la Torre was elected president of the Constituent Assembly and was slated to run as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1980. However, he died before the election. The party was divided between Armando Villanueva and Andres Townsend, each of them claiming to be the political and ideological heir of Haya de la Torre. APRA chose Villanueva as its candidate, while Townsend and other members left the party to create the Hayist Bases Movement. The split among the Apristas allowed former president Fernando Belaúnde Terry of Acción Popular to win the election.

==== Garcia presidency ====
However, APRA managed to win in virtual control of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. It was also during these election that Alan García started his political career, after being elected Deputy for the Province of Lima.

The youthful and charismatic García was elected president on 14 April 1985, with 45% of the vote during the first round. Since he did not receive the 50% of the vote required to win the presidency, García was required to enter the second round against Alfonso Barrantes Lingán (the leftist mayor of Lima) of the Izquierda Unida Coalition. Barrantes, however, decided not to enter the second round of the elections, saying he did not want to prolong the political uncertainty of the country.

García was thus declared president on 1 June and officially took power on 28 July 1985. It was the first time in its sixty-year history that the populist APRA party had come to power in Peru.

His presidency was marked by world-record hyperinflation with the annual rate exceeding 13,000 percent per year. García&#x27;s administration devastated the local economy as well as all governmental institutions. Hunger, corruption, injustice, abuse of power, elitism, and social unrest raised to dramatic levels spreading throughout the whole nation, spurring terrorism.

At García&#x27;s farewell speech, he was booed by the entire opposition forces and prevented from speaking. The anecdotal event was televised. That same day the board of the Chamber of Deputies requested the creation of a special committee to investigate García&#x27;s presidency, accusing him of massive corruption and illicit enrichment. The committee attacked García with numerous proven accusations involving embezzlement, misappropriation and bribery, based – among other trustworthy sources – on a U.S. congressional investigation that linked García with the BCCI scandal and had found millions of dollars in banks. New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau charged García officially. Later in 1992, then Senator John Kerry presided over the BCCI Scandal Report, (The BCCI Affair) which concluded that García was not only guilty of corruption, but also directly involved in an international racketeering network with activities that included drug and arms trafficking. Finally, the Peruvian Supreme Court, overturned prior judicial verdicts and declared all the probes and constitutional accusations against García &quot;null&quot;.

In May 1989, APRA chose as its standard bearer Luis Alva Castro for the 1990 general election. For the final runoff, APRA sealed a hidden deal with Cambio 90 and Alberto Fujimori, to prevent the leading candidate Mario Vargas Llosa, today a Nobel laureate and renown novelist and political analyst, from getting elected. Fujimori, a complete unknown, was subsequently elected.

==== Fujimori presidency ====
As Fujimori assumed the presidency in 1990, Congress was dominated by the opposition forces of Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s Democratic Front. Fujimori&#x27;s party had gained only 32 deputies out of 180, and 14 senators out of 60. The majority was divided between APRA (22%) and the Democratic Front, with about 32% of Congress. In 1992, Fujimori organized a successful coup d&#x27;état. This allowed García to flee Peru and request asylum denouncing political persecution, the asylum was granted by Colombian president César Gaviria. Shortly after, under the protection of president Francois Mitterrand, García received again the privilege of political refuge and left Colombia to reside in Paris.

Fujimori convened elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress, in which APRA did not participate. In the 1995 general elections, the APRA nominee for president was Mercedes Cabanillas, gaining only 4%, behind former United Nations Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar (21%) and the reelected Fujimori (64%). The party only got 8 congressman out of 120, while Fujimori&#x27;s Cambio 90-New Majority dominated Congress with 67.

=== 21st century ===
In 2000, Abel Salinas was elected as the presidential nominee, being the worst general election for APRA, gaining only 1% of the popular vote. Only 6 APRA congressman were elected. As many assume the election was a fraud, Fujimori resigned after the corruption of his government was revealed by the opposition.

At the legislative elections, the party won 19.7% of the popular vote and 28 out of 120 seats in Congress. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, Alan García Pérez, won 25.8% of the vote, placing second and was defeated in the second round by Alejandro Toledo.

In February 2005, García officially commenced his campaign for the 2006 presidential election. He came in second place by a slim margin over Lourdes Flores, and faced Ollanta Humala in a run-off election on 4 June. He became president again as Humala conceded after exit polls and partial vote counts showed García leading. Breaking News, World News and Video from Al Jazeera. He officially took office on 28 July 2006.

On the eve of leaving the government, García called a general election for 10 April 2011. APRA ran as a guest presidential candidate for former minister Mercedes Aráoz, but her candidacy was frustrated by numerous internal conflicts with other party leaders. In this way, the party participated in the elections without a candidate, obtaining 4 seats in Congress. It has remained an organized opposition party against the Ollanta Humala administration. For the 2016 elections, APRA signed an alliance with the Partido Popular Cristiano and Vamos Perú, under the title of &quot;Alianza Popular (Popular Alliance)&quot;, with Alan García as the presidential candidate, who will serve a third term and long-time rival Lourdes Flores as Garcia&#x27;s first running mate. According to Javier Barreda, this alliance did not benefit these three parties at all. On 13 May 2016, a political alliance between APRA and Keiko Fujimori is seen.

In the elections of said year, Alan García lost resoundingly, remaining in fifth place with 6.19%. Hours later, the candidate resigned from the APRA presidency calling for an &quot;internal restructuring of the party.&quot; On Monday, 3 October 2016, Enrique Cornejo asks that they not think of putting obstacles that hinder votes, where he said do not think of cheating on the part of your &quot;companions&quot;.

On 17 April 2019, former President Alan García died at the Casimiro Ulloa Hospital in Miraflores after shooting himself in the head after a preliminary search and arrest warrant against him due to the Odebrecht corruption scandal.

In the extraordinary congressional elections of 2020, held after the dissolution of Congress in 2019, the APRA had its worst electoral result of 2.7%, failing to pass the 5% electoral threshold, which means that it would not have parliamentary representation after 25 uninterrupted years. However, it managed to maintain the registration as a political party since it was an extraordinary electoral process.

In 2020, the party chose former Minister Nidia Vílchez as its presidential candidate for the 2021 general elections. However, and because the Special Electoral Jury (JEE) declared the party&#x27;s congressional list inadmissible, they decided to withdraw Vílchez&#x27;s candidacy for the presidency. Because the party did not participate in the general elections, the party could lose its registration as a political party.

== International alignment ==
APRA is a member of the Socialist International.

The youth organization of APRA is known as Juventud Aprista Peruana.

Hilda Gadea – the first female Secretary of the Economy of the Executive National Committee for APRA; later married Che Guevara and wrote a memoir.

<text>Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper ( ; born June 22, 1953) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Known for her distinctive image, featuring a variety of hair colors and eccentric clothing, and for her powerful four-octave vocal range; Lauper has sold over 50 million records worldwide. She has also been celebrated for her humanitarian work, particularly as an advocate for the LGBT rights in the United States.

Her album &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; (1983) was the first debut album by a female artist to achieve four top-five hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—&quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, &quot;She Bop&quot;, and &quot;All Through the Night&quot;—and earned Lauper the Best New Artist award at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards in 1985. The music video for &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; won the Best Female Video Award at the inaugural 1984 MTV Video Music Awards and has been recognized by MTV, VH1 and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the greatest music videos of the era. Her second album, &quot;True Colors&quot; (1986), scored two more top-five hits; the title track and &quot;Change of Heart&quot;. Lauper&#x27;s chart success continued with the singles &quot;The Goonies &#x27;R&#x27; Good Enough&quot; (1985), &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; (1989) and the dance club hit &quot;That&#x27;s What I Think&quot; (1993).

Since 1983, Lauper has released twelve studio albums and participated in many other projects. In 2010, &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; became &quot;Billboard&quot; most successful blues album of the year, remaining at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues Albums chart for 13 consecutive weeks. In 2013, she won the Tony Award for Best Original Score for composing the Broadway musical &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;, making her the first woman to win the category by herself. The musical was awarded five other Tonys, including Best Musical. In 2014, Lauper was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album for the cast recording. In 2016, the West End production won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical.

Lauper&#x27;s accolades include two Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Tony Award, three MTV Video Music Awards, four &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, two American Music Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is one of the few singers to win three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT). In 2015, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lauper is featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Women Who Rock&quot; exhibit. Her debut album ranked among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, while &quot;Time After Time&quot; was included in VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 years. VH1 has ranked Lauper No. 58 of the &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

==Life and career==
===1953–1979: Early life===
Lauper was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to a Catholic family. Her father, Fred, was of Swiss-German descent, and a descendant of Christen Lauper, a leader of the Swiss peasant war of 1653. Her mother, Catrine (; 1930–2022), was of Italian (Sicilian) descent. Lauper&#x27;s siblings are her younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister Ellen. Lauper&#x27;s parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again.

Lauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as the Beatles and Judy Garland. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister.

Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors and eccentric clothing, and took a friend&#x27;s advice to spell her name as &quot;Cyndi&quot; rather than &quot;Cindy&quot;. Her unconventional sense of style led to classmates bullying and throwing stones at her.

Lauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled although she later earned her GED. She ran away from home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs. In 2019, Lauper gave the commencement address at Northern Vermont University – Johnson, the academic institution that now includes Johnson State. At this event, NVU bestowed upon her an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters.

In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta.

===1980–1982: Blue Angel===

In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player John Turi through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky, manager of the Allman Brothers Band, heard the tape and liked Lauper&#x27;s voice. He bought Blue Angel&#x27;s contract for $5,000 and became their manager.

Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released the album &quot;Blue Angel&quot; on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (&quot;It went lead&quot;, as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy. After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.

After Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time, due to her financial problems, working in retail stores, waitressing at IHOP (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager sexually harassed her), and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero. Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range. In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager and had her sign a recording contract with Portrait Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records.

===1983–1985: &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;===
On October 14, 1983, Lauper released her first solo album, &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;. The album became a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 4 in the U.S. and reaching the top five in eight other countries. The primary studio musicians were Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman (of the Hooters), Rick Chertoff, Richard Termini and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics alike, in part due to her hybrid punk image, which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas.

Lauper co-wrote four songs on &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, including the hits &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;She Bop&quot;. On the songs she did not write, Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics. Such is the case with &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;. Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.

The album includes five cover songs, including the Brains&#x27; new wave track &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; (No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and Prince&#x27;s &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;. The album made Lauper the first female artist to have four consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top five hits from one album. The LP stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks, and since has sold 16 million copies worldwide.

Cyndi won Best New Artist at the 1985 Grammy Awards. &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; also received nominations for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;), and Song of the Year (for &quot;Time After Time&quot;). She wore almost a pound of necklaces at her award ceremony. It also won the Grammy for Best Album Package, which went to the art director, Janet Perr.
The video for &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; won the inaugural award for Best Female Video at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, and made Lauper an MTV staple. The video featured professional wrestling manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano as Lauper&#x27;s father, and her real-life mother, Catrine, as her mother, and also featured her attorney, her manager, her brother Butch, and her dog Sparkle. In 1984–85, Lauper appeared on the covers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;Time,&quot; and &quot;Newsweek.&quot; She appeared twice on the cover of &quot;People&quot;, and was named a &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine Woman of the Year in 1985.

In 1985, Lauper participated in USA for Africa&#x27;s famine-relief fund-raising single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, which sold more than 20 million copies since then.

Lauper appeared with professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who was cast as her &quot;bodyguard&quot; and would also later make many appearances as herself in a number of the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection&quot; events, and played Wendi Richter&#x27;s manager in the inaugural WrestleMania event. Dave Wolff, Lauper&#x27;s boyfriend and manager at the time, was a wrestling fan as a boy, and engineered the rock and wrestling connection.

In 1985, Lauper released the single &quot;The Goonies &#x27;R&#x27; Good Enough,&quot; from the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Goonies,&quot; and an accompanying video which featured several wrestling stars. The song reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

===1986–1988: &quot;True Colors&quot; and &quot;Vibes&quot;===
Lauper received a nomination at the 1986 Grammy Awards: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;What a Thrill,&quot; another in the same category the following year (for the album track &quot;911&quot;) and yet another in 1988, Best Long Form Music Video for &quot;Cyndi Lauper in Paris&quot;.

Lauper released her second album, &quot;True Colors&quot; in 1986. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 42 and rose to its #4 peak.

In 1986, Lauper appeared on the Billy Joel album &quot;The Bridge&quot;, with a song called &quot;Code of Silence&quot;. She is credited as having written the lyrics with Joel and she sings a duet with him. In the same year, Lauper also sang the theme song for the series &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, credited as &quot;Ellen Shaw&quot;. In 1987, David Wolff produced a concert film for Lauper called &quot;Cyndi Lauper in Paris&quot;. The concert was broadcast on HBO.

Lauper made her film debut in August 1988 in the quirky comedy &quot;Vibes&quot;, alongside Jeff Goldblum, Peter Falk, and Julian Sands. Lauper played a psychic in search of a city of gold in South America. Deborah Blum and Tony Ganz produced the film, with David Wolff as associate producer. To prepare for the role, Lauper took a few classes in finger waving and hair setting at the Robert Fiancé School of Beauty in New York, and studied with a few Manhattan psychics. The film flopped and was poorly received by critics, but would later be considered a cult classic.

Lauper contributed a track called &quot;Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)&quot; for the &quot;Vibes&quot; soundtrack, but the song was not included. A music video was released, a high energy, comic action/adventure romp through a Chinese laundry. The song reached No. 54 on the US charts, but fared better in Australia, reaching No. 8.

===1989–1992: &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and marriage===
&quot;A Night to Remember&quot; – Lauper&#x27;s third album – was released in the spring of 1989. The album had one hit, the No. 6 single &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, originally recorded by Roy Orbison, three years before his death on December 6, 1988. Lauper received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 1990 Grammy Awards for &quot;I Drove All Night&quot;, but overall album sales for &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; were down. The music video for the album&#x27;s song &quot;My First Night Without You&quot; was one of the first to be closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.

Because of a friendship with Yoko Ono, Lauper took part in the May 1990 John Lennon tribute concert in Liverpool, performing the Beatles song &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot;, and the John Lennon song &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;. She also took part in Ono and Lennon&#x27;s son Sean&#x27;s project called the Peace Choir, performing a new version of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

On November 24, 1991, Lauper married actor David Thornton.

===1993–1995: &quot;Hat Full of Stars&quot; and &quot;Twelve Deadly Cyns&quot;===
Lauper&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Hat Full of Stars&quot; was released in June 1993 and was met with critical acclaim, but failed commercially, unsupported by her label. The album, which tackled such topics as homophobia, spousal abuse, racism, and abortion sold fewer than 120,000 copies in the United States and peaked at No. 112 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The video for the album&#x27;s song &quot;Sally&#x27;s Pigeons&quot; features the then-unknown Julia Stiles as the young Cyndi.

The album was written and produced with the help of Jan Pulsford (Lauper&#x27;s keyboard player) and producer Mark Saunders. As in &quot;Hat Full of Stars&quot;, some of the songs in &quot;Sisters of Avalon&quot; addressed dark themes. The song &quot;Ballad of Cleo and Joe&quot; addressed the complications of a drag queen&#x27;s double life. The song &quot;Say a Prayer&quot; was written for a friend of hers who had died from AIDS. &quot;Unhook the Stars&quot; was used in the film &quot;Unhook the Stars&quot;. Again without support from her label, the release failed in America, spending a single week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart at No. 188. This album also met with much critical praise, including &quot;People&quot; magazine, which declared it &quot;&#x27;90s nourishment for body and soul. Lauper sets a scene, makes us care, gives us hope.&quot;

==Activism==

Lauper has been an LGBT rights supporter throughout her career, campaigning for equality through various charities and gay pride events around the world. Lauper stated that she became involved in gay rights advocacy because her sister Ellen is a lesbian and because Lauper herself was passionate about equality. Lauper cites her sister Ellen as a role model.

Her song &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; celebrates the memory of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man beaten to death in Wyoming. As a member of the Matthew Shepard Foundation Board, Lauper devoted a concert tour in 2005 to promoting the Foundation&#x27;s message.

She co-founded the True Colors tour for Human Rights throughout the United States and Canada in June 2007. One dollar from each ticket was earmarked for the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates equal rights for LGBT individuals.

In 2008, Lauper started True Colors United
The organization works to end youth homelessness, focusing on the experiences of LGBT youth. She set up the &quot;True Colors Residence&quot; in New York City for LGBT homeless youths. The 30-bed facility offers temporary shelter and job placement help. In April 2010, TCU launched the Give a Damn campaign, to help get straight people more involved in LGBT rights.

In August 2008, she contributed an article titled &quot;Hope&quot; to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, encouraging Americans to vote for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Lauper performed at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

In 2022, Lauper launched the Girls Just Want To Have Fundamental Rights Fund, with a mission to support organizations &quot;fighting for the right to abortion and reproductive healthcare.&quot;

==Legacy==
Lauper was described by AllMusic&#x27;s Lindsay Planer as &quot;an iconoclastic vocalist who revolutionized the role of women in rock and roll&quot;. Over her 40-year career, she influenced multiple recording artists including Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Vanessa Paradis, Tegan and Sara, Kim Petras, Nicki Minaj, Poppy and Yelle. Due to her success and influence Lauper has been inducted into both the Hollywood and Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Spotify said &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot; and Lauper&#x27;s distinctive idiosyncratic appearance &quot;helped popularize the image of punk and new wave for America, making it an acceptable part of the pop landscape&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine stated that her debut was &quot;arguably the first time explicitly punk-influenced elements were front-and-center on the pop landscape, both musically and via Lauper&#x27;s Patrick Lucas-styled ensembles, dressing up the droll Reagan decade in feminist chutzpah&quot;. The album ranked at No. 487 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. The album ranked at No. 41 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of Women Who Rock: The 50 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2012. &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; review stated, &quot;A wild and wonderful skyrocket of a voice ... Lauper&#x27;s extraordinary pipes connect with the right material, the results sound like the beginning of a whole new golden age.&quot; Thirty years after its release, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it an &quot;everlastingly saucy supersmash&quot;.

Sheila Moeschen argued that &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; &quot;embodied a different kind of feminine aesthetic that ran counter to the raw sensuality and edginess of her contemporaries like Madonna or veteran rockers Joan Jett and Pat Benatar&quot;, that introduced &quot;a nation of women to a new kind of female role model, one that celebrated difference and encouraged playfulness in self-expression&quot;. John Rockwell wrote that the song was &quot;a giddily upbeat attestation to female pleasure that simultaneously made a feminist statement, fulfilled male fantasies and—especially in its often-played video version—evoked the warmth of family and friends&quot;. Its music video won the first-ever Best Female Video prize at the 1984 VMAs. It featured a multicultural cast of women with teased, sideways hair and neon eye shadow, singing alongside Lauper.

&quot;Time After Time&quot; has been covered by over a hundred artists and was ranked at No. 22 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and at No. 19 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s.

&quot;She Bop&quot;, the third single from &quot;She&#x27;s So Unusual&quot;, is the first and only top ten song to directly mention a gay porn magazine. An ode to masturbation, it was included in the PMRC&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; list that led to the Parental Advisory sticker appearing on recordings thought to be unsuitable for young listeners. In a retrospective, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the 36th best song of 1984, praising its unusual playfulness regarding sexuality.

&quot;True Colors&quot; is a gay anthem, after which True Colors United, which advocates for runaway and homeless LGBT youth, is named.

<text>Lagos ( ; also US: ; ), or Lagos City, is a large metropolitan city in southwest Nigeria. With an upper population estimated above 21 million dwellers, it is the largest city in Nigeria, and the most populous urban area on the African continent. Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until the government&#x27;s December 1991 decision to move their capital to Abuja in the centre of the country. Lagos is a major African financial centre and is the economic hub of Lagos State and Nigeria at large. The city has a significant influence on commerce, entertainment, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, and fashion in Africa. Lagos is also among the top ten of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing cities and urban areas. In 2024, Time Out magazine ranked Lagos as the 19th best city to visit in the world. A megacity, it has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa, and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity.

Lagos emerged as a home to the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba of West Africa in the 15th century, which are contained in the present-day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. Before the 15th century, the Awori settled on a Farmstead along the coastal line in and around which they worked and lived. The Farmstead translates to Ereko in Yoruba, from which comes the Lagos indigenous name &quot;Eko&quot;. The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which was the original city of Lagos, and the Mainland, which it has since expanded into. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present-day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the state.

However, the state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976, and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is still widely referred to as a city, the present-day Lagos, also known as &quot;Metropolitan Lagos&quot;, and officially as &quot;Lagos Metropolitan Area&quot; is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State total land area, but houses about 85% of the state&#x27;s total population.

The population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed. In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a population of about 9 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. Daily, the Lagos area is growing by some 3,000 people or around 1.1 million annually, so the true population figure of the greater Lagos area in 2022 is roughly 28 million (up from some 23.5 million in 2018). Lagos may therefore have overtaken Kinshasa as Africa&#x27;s most populous city. As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of &quot;Greater Metropolitan Lagos&quot;, which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million. The Lagos conurbation is part of an emerging transnational megalopolis on the coast of West Africa that includes areas in five sovereign states, the Abidjan–Lagos Corridor.

The University of Lagos is one of the first generation universities of Nigeria. The business district of Lagos is home to Tinubu Square, named after the aristocratic slave trader Efunroye Tinubu. Lagos contains Murtala Muhammed International Airport, named after Murtala Muhammad, one of the former Nigerian presidents; the airport is one of the busiest African airports. Lagos National Stadium has hosted various international sports events such as the 1980 African Cup of Nations.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Lagos&quot; is derived from the Portuguese word for &quot;lakes&quot;. The pronunciation () is typically standard in British and Nigerian English. Speakers of American English often use the pronunciation (), which sounds more similar to the original Portuguese pronunciation. The native Yoruba name &quot;Èkó&quot; is also used by Yoruba people. Lagos may have been named after Lagos, Portugal, as it was the main centre of Portuguese maritime expeditions down the African coast in the 15th century.

== History ==


== Administration ==
Lagos was formerly the capital city of Nigeria, but it has since been replaced by Abuja. Abuja officially became the capital of Nigeria on December 12 1991, although the decision to move the federal capital had been made in Act No.6 of 1976. Lagos is also home to the High Court of the Lagos State Judiciary, housed in an old colonial building on Lagos Island.
In terms of administration, Lagos is not a single municipality and therefore has no overall city administration. The geographical city limits of Metropolitan Lagos comprise 16 of the 20 Local Government Areas of Lagos State. The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The former Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several Local Government Areas (most notably Lagos Island LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA and Eti-Osa LGA).

The mainland beyond the Municipality of Lagos, on the other hand, included several separate towns and settlements such as Mushin, Ikeja and Agege. In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present-day &quot;Lagos Metropolitan Area&quot;, also known as &quot;Metropolitan Lagos&quot;. The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.

By 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State&#x27;s boundaries and attained a megacity status. This much larger area is referred to as &quot;Greater Metropolitan Lagos&quot; or &quot;Lagos Megacity Region&quot;, which is a continuously built-up land area of an additional , in LGAs situated next to Lagos&#x27;s eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and also beyond its northern limits, spilling into some LGAs in adjoining Ogun State. Ogun State LGAs that have become part of Greater Metropolitan Lagos include Obafemi Owode, Sagamu, Ifo, Ado-Odo/Ota and part of Ewekoro.

Today, the word &quot;Lagos&quot; most often refers to the urban area, called &quot;Metropolitan Lagos&quot; in Nigeria, which includes both the islands of the former municipality of Lagos and the mainland suburbs. Lagos State government is responsible for some of the utilities including roads and transportation, power, water, health, and education. Metropolitan Lagos extends over 16 of the 20 LGAs of Lagos State and contains about 85% of the population of Lagos State, including some semi-rural areas. Lagos has a considerable number of high-rise buildings that dominate its skyline. Most of the tall buildings are located in the downtown Central Business District.

== Demography ==
Although the 2006 National Population Census of Nigeria credited the metropolitan area with a population figure of 7,937,932, the figure is at variance with some projections by the United Nations and other population agencies and groups worldwide. The population figure of Lagos State given by the Lagos State Government is 17,553,924. That figure was based on claimed conducted enumeration for social planning by the Lagos State Government&#x27;s &quot;parallel census&quot; and it believes that since the inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Lagos constitute 88% of the Lagos State population, the population of metropolitan Lagos is about 15.5 million.

A rejoinder to Lagos State Government views concluded that Lagos State concealed the fact that the population projection, for Lagos Urban Agglomeration by the UN agencies, had been revised downwards substantially as early as 2003. It failed to interpret the two most important and fairly representative and reliable secondary data sets already in the public domain, the National Identity Card Scheme and the 2003 Voters Registration figures from INEC. The figures for 2007 voter registration by INEC were an act sequel to the release of the provisional census results and comprehensively corroborated, vindicated and validated the population figures.
According to the official results of the 2006 census, there were 8,048,430 inhabitants in Metropolitan Lagos. This figure was lower than anticipated and has created controversy in Nigeria. Lagos Island, the central Local Government Area and historic center of Metropolitan Lagos, had a population of 212,700 at the 2006 Census.

Authorities of Lagos State have disputed the results of the 2006 census, accusing the Nigerian National Population Commission of undercounting the population of the state. This accusation is denied by the National Population Commission. A study found that research carried out by Africapolis (the African subsidiary of e-Geopolis backed by the Agence française de développement), in addition to the cross-referencing of official figures with more scientific independent research concluded that the 2006 census figures for Lagos State of about 9 million were valid and that the state&#x27;s own assessments are inflated.

Lagos is indigenous to Yoruba people, the central Yoruba language is widely spoken. It is by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum due to the influx of people from other regions for economic purposes. In 1999, the United Nations predicted that the city&#x27;s metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populated cities in the world.

== Geography ==
Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas—the &quot;Island&quot; and the &quot;Mainland&quot;.

=== Cityscape ===
The city of Lagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse and range from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings or a mixture. Brazilian style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city.

==== Island ====
The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the &quot;Mainland&quot; by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks and are connected by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events take place, as well as where most of the upscale residential areas are concentrated. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be on the Island include Lagos Island and Eti-Osa. The major upscale Island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island. Three major bridges join the Island to the Mainland. They are the Carter Bridge, which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge, which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon. The Ikoyi link bridge links Ikoyi and Lekki Phase 1, both of which are part of the Island.

Construction on the Fourth Mainland Bridge will commence in 2022, according to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.

===== Lagos Island =====
Lagos Island contains a central business district. This district is characterized by high-rise buildings. The Island also contains many of the city&#x27;s largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun Markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, the Central Mosque, the Glover Memorial Hall, Christ&#x27;s Church Cathedral (CMS) and the Oba&#x27;s Palace (Iga Idunganran). Another major part of Lagos Island is Marina. It borders the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island&#x27;s Tinubu Square is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914.

=====Ikoyi=====
Ikoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a landfill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by Falomo bridge, which carries the main road over Five Cowrie creek. Falomo garden, a green public space which was developed by the state government in conjunction with Fidelity Bank in 2017, is located under the bridge. Ikoyi housed the headquarters of the federal government of Nigeria and other buildings owned by the government, including the old federal secretariat complex. The complex today is on reestablishment.

In Ikoyi there are military and police barracks, a top-security prison, and a federal high court of Nigeria. Ikoyi also has hotels, nightclubs, a recreational park, and one of Africa&#x27;s largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.

===== Victoria Island =====
Victoria Island with its annex is situated to the south of Lagos Island and known with a zip code of 101241 as assigned by NIPOST. It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments.
Along with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts several shopping districts. On its seashore along the Atlantic front, there is an environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.

Ajah/Lekki

The Lekki Peninsula shares some prestige with its Ikoyi and Victoria Island neighbours. Development has stretched the piece of land further such that the Ibeju axis, though closer to Epe (which is on the outskirts of Lagos) is almost always described as part of Lekki. The expanse of land starts from the Lekki toll gate, which was the focal stage of the famous #EndSars protest in October 2020, and ends in Ibeju-Lekki and boasts of communities slowly inching their way to suburb status such as Ajah, Awoyaya, Sangotedo, Abijo, and Eputu. There is quite a bit of place to see – the Lekki Conservation Centre; The Novare Mall; The Lekki Free Trade Zone – Dangote, Africa&#x27;s richest man is building his refinery in this FTZ; Lagos Business School; Eleko Beach; Elegushi Beach; La Camaigne Tropicana – a beach/tourist getaway, Pan-Atlantic University. The area has a Catholic monastery.

===== Iddo =====
Across the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called Iddo. Iddo is also a railroad terminus and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland Local Government Area after it was connected to the Mainland like a peninsula.

==== Mainland ====
A huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos Mainland, and most industries are located there. The Mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around Yaba, Ikeja, and Surulere. However, in recent years more nightclubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate, and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attraction. Mainland LGAs include Surulere, Apapa, and Lagos Mainland. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: Agege, Amuwo Odofin, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo and Ikeja (site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and the capital of Lagos State).

Major areas on the Mainland include Ebute Metta, Yaba and Ejigbo. Some rivers, like Badagry Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.

== Climate ==
Lagos experiences a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification, as there are three months under of rain, and annual rainfall is not nearly high enough for tropical monsoon classification. The wet season starts in May and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in April. There is also a short dry season from July to August. The wettest month is June with precipitation total , while the driest month is January with precipitation total .

Located near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with mean high temperatures ranging from . Lagos has the highest temperatures in March with a daily range from , and least hot temperatures in August ranging from , not unlike the seasons of coastal locations in the Southern Hemisphere. Summer is the coldest season, with June, July and August are the coldest and rainiest months, while spring (March - May) is the hottest season. 
=== Climate change ===
A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a &quot;moderate&quot; scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Lagos in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Panama City. The annual temperature would increase by and the temperature of the warmest month by , while the temperature of the coldest month would be higher. According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.

Moreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Lagos is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) that would be the most severely affected by sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damage of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion in the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damage, while the additional accounting for the &quot;low-probability, high-damage events&quot; may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the &quot;moderate&quot; RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Sea level rise is being exacerbated by subsidence, which is occurring at up to per year.

== Economy ==
The city of Lagos is a major economic focal point in Nigeria, generating around 30-35% of the country&#x27;s GDP. Most commercial and financial businesses are carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country&#x27;s commercial banks, financial institutions, and major corporations are headquartered. Lagos is also the major information communications and telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy.

The globalisation of Lagos&#x27; economy is rated &quot;beta minus&quot; by the GaWC. This is equivalent to Manchester or Edinburgh in the UK. Lagos is thus the most &quot;globalised&quot; city in West and Central Africa. 5 out of 7 African tech &quot;unicorns&quot; operate out of Lagos (see below). Lagos is home to more tech centres than any other city in Africa. 

Yves Bellinghausen from the German magazine ZEIT summarises: &#x27;Lagos is Africa&#x27;s Hollywood, Manhattan, and Silicon Valley all rolled into one.&#x27;

=== Financial institutions ===

Lagos is a major financial and banking centre. The four largest banks in West and Central Africa are headquartered in Lagos, and another nine banks in Lagos are among the 20 largest banks in the region. Zenith Bank, Access Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank and First Bank have capital of more than US$2 billion each. Banking headquarters are located on Victoria Island and Lagos Island.

The insurance industry in Nigeria is comparatively and modestly developed, with an industry turnover of around US$1 billion per year. As with the banks, the headquarters of the insurance companies are predominantly located in Lagos.

=== Ports ===

The Port of Lagos, formally known as the Lagos-Elbert Mathews Memorial Port, is Nigeria&#x27;s leading port and one of the largest and busiest Ports in Africa. Due to the large urban population, Lagos is categorized as a medium-port megacity using the Southampton System for port-city classification. It is administered by the Nigerian Ports Authority. The &quot;Port of Lagos / Apapa&quot; is the oldest and largest port in the country, both in terms of land area and cargo volume handled. More than half of Nigeria&#x27;s maritime trade is handled here, and the port also acts as a transhipment point for landlocked countries such as Chad and Niger. Around 1,000 ships with 5,700,000 tonnes of cargo call at the Lagos port complex annually.

&quot;Tin Can Island Port&quot; is located west of Apapa near the Lagos Port Complex. It was established in 1975.

In early 2023, the &quot;deep sea port of Lekki&quot; was commissioned 50 km east of Lagos. This thus does not belong to the urban area of Lagos but to the state of the same name.

=== Entertainment industry and media ===

==== Nollywood ====
Lagos is the centre of the West African film, music, and TV industries. The film industry in the Surulere locality ranks second or third in the world, ahead of or behind Hollywood, depending on the survey. PricewaterhouseCoopers Int. forecasts that the Nigerian entertainment industry will grow 85% to $15 billion.
Since the success of the Nigerian thriller &quot;The Figurine&quot;, Nigerian film has increasingly turned to high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to consistently new box office revenue records in Nigeria (2009&#x27;s &quot;The Figurine&quot;, 2013&#x27;s &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Party&quot;, 2023&#x27;s &quot;Battle on Buka Street&quot;).

==== Newspapers ====
In Nigeria, newspapers are available in digital format and are predominantly produced in Lagos. The most widely read newspaper in Lagos, by its own account, is Punch. The Vanguard newspaper is one of the few dailies that is not only available online but also in print. Other publications include The Guardian, The Nation, The Sun and the Nigerian Tribune. The latter was founded in colonial times, in 1949.

==== Television ====
The most watched television station in Lagos (and in Nigeria) is the 24-hour news channel Channels TV, based in Lagos. Some of its presenters use an overly correct standard of British English that compatriots like to mock. The same can be said of Arise TV and the state broadcaster NTA. The private African Independent Television focuses on entertainment and infotainment. Programmes in pidgin English or in Yoruba have moved to digital streaming services and offer action films, comedies and heartbreak productions.

=== &quot;Africa&#x27;s Silicon Valley&quot; ===

Seven tech start-ups in Africa are said to have &quot;unicorn&quot; status (worth over 1 billion euros). Five of them are based in Lagos: &quot;Flutterwave&quot; is in the virtual bank card business. &quot;Opay&quot; and &quot;Interswitch&quot; are platforms for online bookings. &quot;Andela&quot; trains software engineers and places them in the Nigerian labour market. &quot;Jumia&quot; is an online retail company that offers a wide range of products such as electronic devices and fashion.

Lagos is home to more tech hubs than any other city in Africa. With more than 90 million internet users, Lagos is attracting investors who want to capitalise on this expanding technology hotspot. Startupgrind.com refers to Lagos as &quot;Africa&#x27;s Silicon Valley&quot;. Bloomberg highlights &quot;Nigeria&#x27;s Chaotic Rise as the Tech Heart of Africa&quot; and means &quot;Lagos&quot;, specifically the Yaba district.Lagos is the only African city to have both a Google and a Microsoft office. &quot;MTN&quot; maintains the first and still predominant 4G network in Nigeria. Airtel is another 4G provider. 9Mobile and Dataflex are Internet providers. Paystack is used by Nigerians who regularly receive payments from abroad. ULesson maintains a platform on which secondary school learning content is presented. Hotels.ng allows hotel bookings to be made throughout Africa.

=== Oil refinery ===
For decades, there was no oil processing industry in Nigeria, apart from illegal refineries in the Niger Delta (which are very polluting due to the lack of cracking). Nigeria therefore had to have the end products of domestic crude oil such as fuels, bitumen, paraffin, motor oil, polypropylene etc. produced in US or European refineries, with transport costs over thousands of nautical miles and margins for middlemen. The oil refinery in Lekki went into operation in December 2023 and is expected to process 650,000 barrels of oil per day when fully operational, making it the seventh largest oil refinery in the world. By comparison, the largest refinery in the United Kingdom in Fawley processes 270,000 barrels a day, while the biggest US refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, processes 607,000 barrels a day. 57,000 people have been hired.

=== Fertiliser plant ===
Since 2022, a new fertiliser production plant has been producing 3 million tonnes of fertiliser a year (roughly equivalent to Germany&#x27;s fertiliser consumption). With no more Russian fertiliser coming onto the world market in 2022 due to this country&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, Nigeria is stepping into a gap in the market. &quot;The fertiliser market is a seller&#x27;s market,&quot; company owner Dangote raves. &quot;People are begging for us to sell and we are choosy about who we sell to.&quot;

=== Pharmaceutical industry ===

Nigeria hosts about 60 percent of the pharmaceutical production capacity in Africa (status 2022). The larger pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria are located in the North of Lagos. &quot;Emzor Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd&quot; appears to be the pharmaceutical producer with the most employees. Next in line are &quot;Fidson Healthcare Plc&quot;, &quot;May &amp; Baker Nig. Plc&quot; and &quot;Swiss Pharma Nigeria&quot;.

=== Automotive industry ===
Nord Automobile Limited has two assembly plants in Lagos: in Sangotedo and in Epe. The company manufactures its own plastic parts and plans to take on steel pressing in the future. The company offers eight different models. However, company founder and CEO Oluwatobi Ajayi is struggling with insufficient demand and the increase in the price of imported components due to the devaluation of the local currency, the naira, in 2023. He is looking for solutions with a German partner.

=== Lekki Free Trade Zone ===

The Lekki Free Trade Zone is a free trade zone in the eastern part of Lekki, covering a total area of about 155 square kilometres. It has an area of 30 square kilometres and is to be developed into a multifunctional district: integrating industry, trade and commerce, real estate development, warehousing and logistics, tourism, and entertainment.

=== Trade fairs and exhibitions ===
Lagos has two major congress halls, the Eko Convention Center and the Landmark Centre. The Eko Convention Center has 5,151 m2 and 13 meeting rooms. It hosts for example the Lagos Fashion Fair. The Landmark Centre has 1,004 m2 and 8 meeting rooms. The Landmark Centre hosts annual meetings like &quot;Medic/Medlab West Africa&quot;, &quot;Beauty West Africa&quot; or &quot;agro-food&quot;.

The &quot;Lagos Leather Fair&quot; is the largest leather fair in West Africa. Nigeria is the sixth largest leather exporter in the world, with brands such as Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton sourcing their goods here. Fashion journalist Waridi Schrobsdorff even puts &#x27;Milan, Paris, Lagos&#x27; on the same level on news channel N-tv.

=== Food processing and distribution ===
Nigeria&#x27;s largest &quot;brewery&quot;, fancily named Nigerian Breweries and a Heineken subsidiary, is located in the Lagos-Surulere district. The Guinness brewery produces its famous strong beer in the Ikeja district. Apparently, the average Nigerian drinks larger quantities of this beverage than the average Irishman. Both breweries also produce non-alcoholic (Guinness also halal) malt beer, which is part of the &quot;Lagos&#x27; way of life&quot;.
In Ketu-Ereyun, between Epe and Ikorodu, Lagos State builds a &quot;Food Logistics Park&quot; – the biggest logistics hub for food in Sub-Saharan Africa. The site is 1.2 million square meters big and the construction is expected to be finished in 2024.

Until now, Nigeria paradoxically exported unhusked rice but had to import husked rice, the country&#x27;s staple food. – The &quot;hulling mill in Imota&quot;, just outside Lagos, processes the rice domestically. When fully operational, the plant, the largest south of the Sahara, is expected to employ 250,000 people and produce 2.5 million 50-kg bags of rice annually.

The &quot;Apapa sugar refinery&quot;, part of the Dangote Group, increased its turnover to 288.3 billion naira (€590 million) in the third quarter of 2022 – a 47% increase from the third quarter of 2021. The sugar refinery has a capacity of 1.44 million metric tonnes per annum and supplies end users as well as bulk buyers such as Nestlé Nigeria Plc, Cadbury Nigeria Plc, Seven-Up Bottling Company Plc and the Nigerian Bottling Company.

Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu opened the new Ikosi International &quot;Fruits Market in the Ketu&quot; district on 25 May 2023. The new fruit market comprises 1,004 shop units. It has its own water and electricity supply, canteen and parking facilities. The facility is monitored by security personnel. On 18 December 2023, Sanwo-Olu opened a similar &quot;Fresh Food Hub&quot; in Idi-Oro, Mushin. Both hubs are aiming to increase the speed of food supply and reduce the percentage of food going to waste before it reaches the customer.

=== Timber, sawmill ===
The Lagos sawmill moved from its old but bursting-at-the-seams location in Oko Baba to Timberville, just outside Lagos, in 2022, where modern facilities are available.

== Tourism ==

Following the re-modernization project achieved by the previous administration of Governor Raji Babatunde Fashola, Lagos is gradually becoming a major tourist destination, being one of the largest cities in Africa and the world. Diasporan Africans and others, especially from East and Southern Africa, are increasingly visiting Lagos mostly to understand and experience the Nigeria that has been presented to them by Nollywood.

=== Beaches, water sports ===
Lagos has sandy beaches by the Atlantic Ocean, including Tarkwa Bay, Elegushi Beach and Alpha Beach. Lagos also has a number of private beach resorts, including the Inagbe Grand Beach Resort.

On Wole Olateju Crescent, in the immediate vicinity of Lekki Bridge, there are several companies that offer boat tours and rent kayaks or jet skis.

=== Dancing, shopping, dining ===
Nightclubs are mainly found on Victoria Island, where the well-to-do and foreign guests hang out, and around Adeniran Ogunsanya Street in Surulere.

Rooftop restaurants on the Atlantic beach or on the lagoon offer not only culinary delights and a view but also a welcome breeze from the sea for the heat-stricken visitor.

Even before the devaluation of the local currency, the naira, in June 2023, Lagos was a place where US$10 (9.10 euros) could keep you full for a day and buy souvenirs to boot. The stress-resistant and experienced bargain-hunter buys brand-name clothes for a knockdown price at the eco-market and the adjoining Martin Street.

The Lekki Arts and Crafts Market (known to Lagosians as Oba Elegushi Market) is a large market that displays a wide variety of African arts and crafts. It is considered the largest art market in Nigeria.

=== Parks and gardens ===

&quot;Freedom Park&quot; is a memorial and recreational park in the middle of Lagos city centre on Lagos Island, Nigeria, which used to be Her Majesty&#x27;s Broad Street Prison. It was designed by architect Theo Lawson. The park was built to preserve the history and cultural heritage of Nigerians. The monuments in the park commemorate the colonial heritage of Lagos and the history of Her Majesty&#x27;s Broad Street Prison. It was erected to mark the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations in October 2010. The park is a national memorial, a historical landmark, a cultural site and an arts and recreation centre. Now a tranquil place for individuals, visitors and collective contemplation, the park is open to the public daily. Today, Freedom Park has become a gathering place for various social events and recreational entertainment.

&quot;Tinubu Square&quot; (formerly Independence Square) is an open space on Broad Street, Lagos Island, Lagos State, Nigeria, named after slave trader, merchant and aristocrat Efunroye Tinubu. It used to be called Ita Tinubu before it was renamed Independence Square and later Tinubu Square by the leaders of the First Nigerian Republic after Nigerian independence. Tinubu Square is the most popular square in Nigeria.

&quot;Tafawa Balewa Square&quot; is a 50,000-capacity stadium that was a racecourse under the British and where independence was proclaimed in 1960. At the entrance to the square are sculptures of four white horses and seven red eagles. After Abuja replaced Lagos as the capital, the &quot;TBS&quot; fell into disrepair. Attempts by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to renovate the stadium have not yielded results (as of 2023).

&quot;Ndubuisi Kanu Park&quot; is a public green space much loved by all for relaxation.

=== Zoos ===

The &quot;Lekki Conservation Centre&quot; is essentially the Lagos Zoo. It consists of a fenced-off strip of vegetation that attempts to replicate rainforest, mangroves and savannah. There are monkeys, numerous birds, snakes and crocodiles. There is a small museum with stuffed animals. On Sundays however, it is used for lengthy religious service. According to a tourism website, the LCC is the second-most popular site in Lagos to see (after the Nike Gallery, see chapter &quot;Art&quot;).

&quot;Lufasi Nature Park&quot; is the Lekki Urban Forestry and Animal Shelter Initiative. It preserves nature and protects wildlife and endangered species. Nollywood film crews often use this park as a set.

=== Buildings ===
* National Theatre, Iganmu (see chapter &quot;Monumental buildings&quot;).
* Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, the first cable-stayed bridge built in Nigeria.
* The Oba&#x27;s (Kings) Palace at Iga Idunganran – This is an ancestral palace for the Oba of Lagos – the custodian on the traditions and customs of the people of Eko.
* Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos

=== Statues ===
*Herbert Macaulay memorial statue,
* Welcome to Lagos statue showing three Lagos white cap chiefs. In local parlance, they are noted as warning you not to &quot;suegbe, didinrin nor ya mugun&quot; while in Lagos. Meaning?

=== Other tourist attractions ===
* Takwa Bay – A popular bay from where you can observe shipping traffic in and out of the Lagos port as well as enjoy some water sports. If you have a personal yacht this is where to go.
* Festac Town.

=== Not LGBT-friendly ===
Despite its active nightlife and prevailing joie de vivre, Lagos, like all cities in Nigeria, is &quot;not LGBT-friendly&quot;. Nigeria&#x27;s 2014 legislation in this regard is among the most draconian systems of repression against queer people in the world. Homosexuals, but also their &quot;supporters&quot; such as people who have attended a same-sex wedding in another country, or hotel staff who have provided a room for a queer couple, theoretically can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.

== Culture ==
Lagos is a cultural centre of Nigeria. As a port city and the starting point of British colonisation, the Western influence is stronger here than in probably any other Nigerian city. All Nigerian ethnic groups can be found in the melting pot of this metropolis, with the Yoruba predominating. The music and film industries in the city are dynamic centres of the country with international acclaim.

=== Monumental buildings ===
A very striking building in Lagos is the National Arts Theatre with its oval base. The renovation of the National Arts Theatre was completed in March 2023. With the new &quot;blue line&quot; of the Lagos light rail, the National Theatre is recently easily accessible – the station &quot;National theatre&quot; is at a stone&#x27;s throw distance from the theatre building.

Another frequently photographed structure in Lagos is the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge – or more simply: Lekki bridge.

The Cathedral Church of Christ is at the centre of the oldest part of Lagos. The Anglican church was built between 1867 and 1869, shortly after the establishment of British colonial rule.

The Synagogue Church of All Nations was built in 2004.

=== Art ===

The &quot;Nike Art Gallery&quot; is an art gallery in Lagos owned by Nike Davies-Okundaye. The gallery is probably the largest of its kind in West Africa. It is housed in a five-storey building and has a collection of about 8,000 different works of art by various Nigerian artists such as Chief Josephine Oboh Macleod.

&quot;Red Door Gallery&quot; specializes in African contemporary art.

The &quot;Ovuomaroro Studio and Gallery&quot; is one of the oldest art galleries in Lagos.

The &quot;Alexis Galleries&quot;, owned by Patty Chidiac-Mastrogiannis, is located on Victoria Island. Since its foundation in 2011, Alexis Galleries have been engaged in the presentation and dissemination of Nigerian contemporary styles including; painting, drawing, mixed media, and sculpture. It aims to strengthen and support the Nigerian Art Circle.

In 2002, Lagos was one of the African platform cities for the art exhibition &quot;Documenta 11&quot;.

=== Museum ===

The &quot;National Museum&quot; in Onikan on Lagos Island houses archaeological and ethnographic collections as well as traditional art. There is an opportunity to purchase Nigerian arts and crafts at the adjoining craft centre. Haggling is allowed at the island&#x27;s Jankara market. Spices, printed cotton and hand-woven fabrics as well as leather articles are offered here.

The &quot;John K. Randle Centre&quot; houses an exhibition on Yoruba culture inaugurated in 2023. The curators actively work with artists, writers, craftspeople, historians and storytellers to share the rich Yoruba culture. The John K. Randle Centre is a new, partly interactive kind of museum. It adapts modern Western museum practices to present new forms of storytelling inspired by Yoruba traditions. It celebrates tangible and intangible culture by preserving, enhancing and promoting the cultural heritage of the Yoruba people. The centre actively collects a wide range of items that distinguish it from a traditional museum. The John K. Randle Centre plays a leading role in the repatriation of Yoruba artifacts from European institutions.

The &quot;Kalakuta Republic&quot; is a museum honouring late musician Fela Kuti.

Furthermore, the &quot;Mindscape Children Museum&quot; deserves mentioning. Since 2015 it has been notable as Nigeria&#x27;s premiere Children&#x27;s museum. It aims at social interaction and improves their natural curiosity.

=== Performance ===
The Muson Centre (Musical Society of Nigeria) is a theatre/performance hall. MUSON regularly organizes concerts of both Nigerian and Western genres. Its choir has performed since 1995, and the symphony orchestra, Nigeria&#x27;s only professional symphony orchestra at the time, since 2005. Both perform regularly at the annual MUSON Festival and during the Society&#x27;s concert season.

=== Festivals ===

In Lagos, festivals take place in different months. These are the &quot;Lagos Carnival&quot; in January, the &quot;Eko International Film Festival&quot; in March, the &quot;Lagos Black Heritage Carnival&quot; in April, the &quot;Lagos Photo Festival&quot; in November, the &quot;Book &amp; Art Festival&quot; in November and the &quot;Lagos Food Festival&quot; in December. The &quot;Lagos Jazz Festival&quot; features music of all genres with a focus on jazz. &quot;The Experience&quot; is a decibel-rich gospel concert hosted by the evangelical House of the Rock Church in packed Talewa Balewa Square on the first Friday in December. Ear protection and a certain tolerance for overly dedicated worshippers are recommended.

The &quot;Eyo Carnival&quot; is an irregular festival that originated in Iperu Remo, Ogun State.

=== Cuisine ===

Some of the famous dishes in Lagos include Indigenous delicacies such as eba and egusi; amala and ewedu; jollof (the go-to party dish); ofada rice; plantains (locally called dodo); beans; suya (spicy shish kebab or spiced roasted beef), which is consumed in local clubs and bars with a bottle of cold beer; and eba, made from cassava and eaten with soups prepared with vegetables and mixture of spices and herbs. Other dishes range from local ones like &quot;Iyan&quot; (pounded yam) made from yam flour, amala; asaro, which is usually eaten with various kinds of vegetables; and Egusi (melon soup) to European, Middle-Eastern, and Asian cuisine.

=== Music ===
Lagos is famous throughout Africa for its music scene. Lagos has a vibrant nightlife and has given birth to a variety of styles such as Sakara music, Nigerian hip hop, highlife, juju, fuji and Afrobeats.

James Brown performed in Lagos in 1970. With his band &quot;Wings&quot;, Paul McCartney recorded his fifth post-Beatles album, &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, in an EMI studio in Lagos in August and September 1973. Other foreign musicians who have also performed in the city include Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Akon, Jarule, Ashanti, Usher, Shaggy, R Kelly, Cardi B, Migos especially during the Star Mega Jam; Shakira, John Legend, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Boyz II Men, T-Pain, Brian McKnight, JayZ, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Brandy, Ciara, Keri Hilson and Lauryn Hill.

=== Film ===

The Surulere district is the centre of the Nigerian film industry, commonly referred to as Nollywood. Lagos itself is the location and setting for many films. The city is featured in domestic and foreign feature film productions. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos, which also hosted the World Festival of Black Arts. The 2016 film &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; contains a scene set in Lagos. The Spanish police series &quot;La unidad&quot; (2020–2023), the British drama &quot;The last tree&quot; (2019) and the US-Spanish drama &quot;The Way, Chapter 2&quot; with Martin Sheen (2023 still in development) also use Lagos as a filming location. The film &quot;93 Days&quot; with Danny Glover is a somewhat melodramatic but fact-based account of the Ebola outbreak in Lagos in 2014 and was filmed at original locations.

Since the success of the Nigerian thriller &quot;The Figurine&quot;, Nigerian film has increasingly focused on high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to ever-new records in box office takings in Nigeria (2009: &quot;The Figurine&quot;, 2013: &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, 2016: &quot;The Wedding Party&quot;).

== Sports ==

Association football is Lagos&#x27;s most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C., MFM F.C., and First Bank: both play in Nigeria National League, the second tier of Nigerian football.

The Nigeria national football team, also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for some time; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African Games in 1973.

== Quality of life ==
In a 2018 ranking of cities by quality of life, Lagos ranked 218th among 241 cities surveyed worldwide. In 2023, Lagos ranked second only to Manila in a global survey by the Statista Research Department of cities with the lowest quality of life. The quality of life index value determined is made up of eight sub-indices.

By way of qualification, it must be made clear that index lists of countries or cities are usually not based on verifiable or locally collected data, but often on subjective assessments by Europeans or North Americans. The CPI of Transparency International, for example, is, according to its own definition, &quot;based on the perceived assessment of lay people and experts and is not reduced to actual experience and its analysis&quot;. There is criticism that the indices determined simply reflect the prejudices of Western countries numerically.

== Social situation, informal economy ==
There is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor. Lagos has attracted many young people and families seeking a better life from all other parts of Nigeria and beyond.

In some parts of Lagos, residents have one of the highest standards of living in Nigeria and in Africa.

Reliable data on unemployment, income below the subsistence level, etc. are hardly available for Lagos – as for the whole region – and must be taken with scepticism where they are provided, e.g. in other articles (see also the previous chapter). The reason for this is the widespread &quot;informal economy&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;shadow economy&quot;) in West Africa. Insufficient jobs in traditional wage labour force people to look for work elsewhere. This benefits the informal sector of the economy, where there is no minimum wage and workers pay no taxes, have no holiday or labour rights and often work in unsafe conditions.

According to the International Monetary Fund, about 5.5 million people are employed in the informal economy in Lagos State alone – about three-quarters of Lagos&#x27; workforce. Throughout Lagos, one can observe street vendors, artisans, sellers, small and micro enterprises, shared taxis, tricycles and motorbikes (okada drivers), domestic workers, market traders and others engaged in the informal sector.

Activities in the informal economy are not included in economic statistics. As a result, the wealth of the population, but also e.g. unemployment, is significantly underestimated if the massive informal economy is not taken into account.

== Crime ==
The Council on Foreign Relations&#x27; Nigeria Security Tracker continuously records homicides (murder, manslaughter, etc.) by criminals, religious zealots (such as Boko Haram) and police attacks in Nigeria for each state.

Strikingly, according to the NST, Nigeria&#x27;s two largest cities, Lagos and Kano, are significantly &quot;safer&quot; than rural areas when it comes to homicides. For Lagos State, the NST shows 135 such violent deaths in the past 24 months (as of July 2023), or 5.6 annually for every million inhabitants (for comparison, the United Kingdoms&#x27; crime statistics in 2022 counted 10 homicides per million inhabitants or Turkey&#x27;s 24). For Nigeria as a whole, this figure is 93, with 62% of these cases attributable to police violence (mainly vigilante justice). Boko Haram plays a negligible role (as of 2023) in Lagos.

== Education ==


The Lagos State Government operates state schools. The education system is the 6-3-3-4 system, which is practiced throughout the country (as well as by many other members of the Economic Community of West African States). The levels are Primary, Junior Secondary School (JSS), Senior Secondary School (SSS), and university. All children are offered basic education, with a special focus now on the first nine years. Many of the schools in Nigeria are federally funded and usually are boarding schools. A few examples are the Federal government college Odogbolu (FGCOdogbolu), the Federal government girls&#x27; college Sagamu (FGGCSagamu), and the Federal government college Kano (FGCKano). The state of Lagos has its own federally funded high schools namely Federal government college Ijanikin also known as FGC Lagos, King&#x27;s College Lagos, and Queen&#x27;s College Lagos.

== Healthcare ==

Lagos has many hospitals and medical facilities. The oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa&#x27;s first air-operated emergency medical service, which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is divided into public and private sectors that provide medical services at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.

== Transportation ==

Lagos has one of the largest and most extensive road networks in West Africa. It also has suburban trains and some ferry services. Highways are usually congested in peak hours owing to the geography of the city and to its explosive population growth. Lagos is also linked by many highways and bridges.

=== Highways ===
The Lagos–Ibadan Expressway and the Lagos–Abeokuta Expressway are the major controlled-access highways in the north of the city and serve as inter-state highways to Oyo State and Ogun State respectively. To the west the congested Lagos–Badagry Expressway serves outlying towns such as &quot;Festival Town&quot;, which was the location for the 1977 Festival of Black Arts and Culture 77.

Lagos&#x27;s importance as a commercial centre and port and its strategic location have led to it being the end-point of three Trans-African Highway routes using Nigeria&#x27;s national roads. The Trans–West African Coastal Highway leaves the city as the Badagry Expressway to Benin and beyond as far as Dakar and Nouakchott; the Trans-Sahara Highway to Algiers, which is close to completion, leaves the city as the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.

=== Local public transport ===
The Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) is responsible for public transport.

Since 2021, using a bus or the light rail system is paid for with a public transport card without cash. This card can be used equally on BRT and LBSL buses. One can purchase a public transportation card at any of the ticketing booths at the bus terminals scattered across Lagos State.

==== City buses ====

There are two city bus companies in Lagos: BRT (Lagos Bus Rapid Transit System) and LBSL (Lagos Bus Services). The city buses are air-conditioned. (However, during the Covid epidemic, the AC had to be switched off at all times.)

BRT was inaugurated in 2008. BRT offers e-payment with bank cards. On two arterial roads (Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue), a dedicated bus lane has been established for BRT buses. BRT uses diverse brands of buses, like Ashok Leyland and Yutong. Primero Transport Services (PTS) Ltd. is the sole operator of the BRT buses.

LBSL was inaugurated in 2019. LBSL uses Brazilian-built Marcopolo buses.

The central hub for city buses and long-distance buses is the Oshodi Bus Terminal, which is visible from afar. It is the largest bus station in West Africa and commenced operation in 2019.

The Lagos Transportation Department, LAMATA, introduced electric buses in Lagos in May 2023.

==== Metro rail ====

The first section, or phase, of the rapid transit system, the Lagos Light Rail, has been operational since February 2023. The &quot;Blue Line&quot; runs between Mile 2 and Marina (East-west axis). The extension towards Okokomaiko and the &quot;Red Line&quot; are under construction, The red line will run between Agbado and Marina (North–south axis). There are plans for more light rail lines:
* The green line (Marina to Lekki), 
* the yellow line (Otta/airport to Iddo),
* the purple line (Redeem to Ojo),
* The brown line (Mile 12 to Marina) and
* the orange line (Redeem to Marina).
At the beginning of 2024, it was announced that the Lagos suburban railway had transported 583,000 passengers in its first four months. This would make it the largest inner-city rail service provider in Africa.

On 14 February 2024, Governor Sanwo-Olu announced that the Red Line between Agbado and Oyingbo would be inaugurated on 29 February 2024 in the presence of Nigerian President Tinubu.

==== Rail transport ====

As of June 2021, Lagos has a double-track standard gauge line to Ibadan and a modern main station, Mobolaji Johnson. The Lagos-Ibadan train service runs three trips every Friday and Saturday with the point of departure at the Mobaji Johnson train station. Passengers can travel to Ibadan on Friday at the train station by 8 pm, 12 pm, and 4 pm, while on Saturday, the train movement will depart at 8 am, 1 pm and 6 pm. The Lagos-Ibadan train schedule for Monday to Thursday, and Sunday, remains 8 am and 4 pm. Ticket sales are over the counter and cash only (as of 2023), but e-ticketing will be introduced &quot;soon&quot;. The operator is the Nigerian Railway Corporation.

==== Shared cabs ====
A popular means of transportation are yellow minibuses called &quot;Danfo&quot;. The yellow buses, most of the VW T3 or LT type, characterize the appearance of the city. They run on fixed routes but without a timetable, according to the principle of shared cabs.

==== Ferries ====

According to residents, getting to work by car in Lagos can take six times longer than by ferry. About two million passengers were recorded by the Ferry Authority per month in 2021.

Five Cowries Terminal is the central terminal for ferry operations in Lagos. The terminal is located on the lagoon between Lagos Island and Victoria Island and was commissioned on 30 August 2018. Five Cowries also serves as the headquarters of the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA). It has a jetty, restaurant, bar, administrative offices, ticket offices, waiting area, toilets, lift, conference room, and ATMs. Boats from private individuals and other operators also dock at the pier. The terminal also has a multi-storey car park with space for over 800 vehicles. The multi-storey car park is located behind the terminal (as seen from the lagoon) and is directly connected to the terminal. The terminal was built without thresholds and there is a toilet for wheelchair users. Five Cowries is open seven days a week, from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. The terminal is located next to the Falomo Bridge. The destinations of LASWA ferries are Marina, Ikoyi, Victoria Island, Lekki, Apapa, Ikorodu and Badagry.

=== Air traffic ===

Lagos is served by Murtala Muhammed International Airport, one of the largest and busiest airports in Africa. The MMIA is Nigeria&#x27;s premier international air gateway. The airport&#x27;s history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially on 15 March 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.

The airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government&#x27;s multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems were installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.

A second airport, Lekki-Epe International Airport has been approved by the Federal Government in April 2023.

== Recycling, sewage and water supply ==

=== Recycling/waste management ===
In Lagos, only 40 percent of waste is collected and only 13 percent is recycled. 13,000 tonnes of waste are generated daily in the metropolis. Some residents burn their waste, which exacerbates pollution.

=== Water supply ===
Tap water in Lagos is not suitable for drinking, but can be used for other purposes such as cooking and showering. The water in the distribution network is often contaminated. Since the raw water in the lagoon is too polluted, the city draws its water from the Ogun and Owo rivers. There has been debate about the poor water quality in Lagos for years. At the same time, a sizable proportion of the residents live in slums without access to piped water and sanitation.

=== Sewage ===
An efficient sewage system is lacking. Sewage is flushed into the open sewerage system by rainwater. This water then carries pollutants into rivers and the lagoon. Sewage also enters groundwater through leaking septic tanks and latrines. The contaminants can then contaminate the water in wells and boreholes. Water sold by street vendors can also be affected, as it comes from the same sources.

<text>Amelia Mary Earhart ( ; born July 24, 1897; declared dead January 5, 1939) was an American aviation pioneer. On July 2, 1937, she disappeared over the Pacific Ocean while attempting to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the world. During her life, Earhart embraced celebrity culture and women&#x27;s rights, and since her disappearance has become a global cultural figure. She was the first female pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean and set many other records. She was one of the first aviators to promote commercial air travel, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots.

Earhart was born and raised in Atchison, Kansas, and developed a passion for adventure at a young age, steadily gaining flying experience from her twenties. In 1928, she became a celebrity after becoming the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane. In 1932, she became the first woman to make a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for her achievement. In 1935, she became a visiting faculty member of Purdue University as an advisor in aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to female students. She was a member of the National Woman&#x27;s Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. She was one of the most inspirational American figures from the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s. Her legacy is often compared to that of the early career of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, as well as First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, for their close friendship and lasting influence on women&#x27;s causes.

In 1937, during an attempt to become the first woman to complete a circumnavigational flight of the globe, flying a Lockheed Model 10-E Electra airplane, Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared near Howland Island in the central Pacific Ocean. The two were last seen in Lae, New Guinea, their last land stop before Howland Island, a very small location where they were intending to refuel. It is generally believed that they ran out of fuel before they found Howland Island and crashed into the ocean near their destination. Nearly one year and six months after she and Noonan disappeared, Earhart was officially declared dead.

The mysterious nature of Earhart&#x27;s disappearance has caused much public interest in her life. Her airplane has never been found, which has led to speculation and conspiracy theories about the outcome of the flight. Decades after her presumed death, Earhart was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1968 and the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1973. Several commemorative memorials in the United States have been named in her honor; these include a commemorative US airmail stamp, an airport, a museum, a bridge, a cargo ship, an earth-fill dam, a playhouse, a library, and multiple roads and schools. She also has a minor planet, planetary corona, and newly discovered lunar crater named after her. Numerous films, documentaries, and books have recounted Earhart&#x27;s life, and she is ranked ninth on &quot;Flying&quot;&#x27;s list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.
== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Amelia Mary Earhart was born on July 24, 1897, in Atchison, Kansas, as the daughter of Samuel &quot;Edwin&quot; Stanton Earhart (1867–1930) and Amelia &quot;Amy&quot; (; 1869–1962). Amelia was born in the home of her maternal grandfather Alfred Gideon Otis (1827–1912), who was a former judge in Kansas, the president of Atchison Savings Bank, and a leading resident of the town. Earhart was the second child of the marriage after a stillbirth in August 1896. She was of part-German descent; Alfred Otis had not initially favored the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin&#x27;s progress as a lawyer.

According to family custom, Amelia Earhart was named after her two grandmothers Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton. From an early age, Amelia was the dominant sibling while her sister Grace Muriel Earhart (1899–1998), two years her junior, acted as a dutiful follower. Amelia was nicknamed &quot;Meeley&quot; and sometimes &quot;Millie&quot;, and Grace was nicknamed &quot;Pidge&quot;; both girls continued to answer to their childhood nicknames well into adulthood. Their upbringing was unconventional; Amy Earhart did not believe in raising her children to be &quot;nice little girls&quot;. The children&#x27;s maternal grandmother disapproved of the bloomers they wore, and although Amelia liked the freedom of movement they provided, she was sensitive to the fact the neighborhood&#x27;s girls wore dresses.
The Earhart children seemed to have a spirit of adventure and would set off daily to explore their neighborhood. As a child, Amelia Earhart spent hours playing with sister Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle, and sledding downhill. Some biographers have characterized the young Amelia as a tomboy. The girls kept worms, moths, katydids and a tree toad they gathered in a growing collection. In 1904, with the help of her uncle, Amelia Earhart constructed a home-made ramp that was fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to St. Louis, Missouri, and secured it to the roof of the family tool shed. Following Amelia&#x27;s well-documented first flight, she emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, a torn dress and a &quot;sensation of exhilaration&quot;, saying: &quot;Oh, Pidge, it&#x27;s just like flying!&quot;

In 1907, Edwin Earhart&#x27;s job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a transfer to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Amelia saw her first aircraft at Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Their father tried to interest his daughters in taking a flight but after looking at the rickety &quot;flivver&quot;, Amelia promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round. She later described the biplane as &quot;a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting&quot;.

=== Education ===

Sisters Amelia and Grace—who from her teenage years went by her middle name Muriel—Earhart remained with their grandparents in Atchison while their parents moved into new, smaller quarters in Des Moines. During this period, the Earhart girls received homeschooling from their mother and a governess. Amelia later said she was &quot;exceedingly fond of reading&quot; and spent many hours in the large family library. In 1909, when the family was reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time and Amelia, 12, entered seventh grade.

The Earhart family&#x27;s finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and the hiring of two servants but it soon became apparent Edwin was an alcoholic. In 1914, he was forced to retire; he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment but the Rock Island Railroad never reinstated him. At about this time, Earhart&#x27;s grandmother Amelia Otis died, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter&#x27;s share in a trust, fearing Edwin&#x27;s drinking would exhaust the funds. The Otis house was auctioned along with its contents; Amelia later described these events as the end of her childhood.

In 1915, after a long search, Edwin Earhart found work as a clerk at the Great Northern Railway in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Amelia entered Central High School as a junior. Edwin applied for a transfer to Springfield, Missouri, in 1915, but the current claims officer reconsidered his retirement and demanded his job back, leaving Edwin Earhart unemployed. Amy Earhart took her children to Chicago, where they lived with friends. Amelia canvassed nearby high schools in Chicago to find the best science program; she rejected the high school nearest her home, complaining the chemistry lab was &quot;just like a kitchen sink&quot;. She eventually enrolled in Hyde Park High School but spent a miserable semester for which a yearbook caption noted: &quot;A.E.—the girl in brown who walks alone&quot;.

Amelia Earhart graduated from Hyde Park High School in 1916. Throughout her childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in male-dominated careers, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management, and mechanical engineering. She began junior college at Ogontz School in Rydal, Pennsylvania, but did not complete her program.

===Nursing career and illness===

During Christmas vacation in 1917, Earhart visited her sister in Toronto, Canada, where she saw wounded soldiers returning from World War I. After receiving training as a nurse&#x27;s aide from the Red Cross, Earhart began working with the Voluntary Aid Detachment at Spadina Military Hospital, where her duties included food preparation for patients with special diets and handing out prescribed medication in the hospital&#x27;s dispensary. There, Earhart heard stories from military pilots and developed an interest in flying.

In 1918, when the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic reached Toronto, Earhart was engaged in nursing duties that included night shifts at Spadina Military Hospital. In early November that year, she became infected and was hospitalized for pneumonia and maxillary sinusitis. She was discharged in December 1918, about two months later. Her sinus-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye, and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat. While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, Earhart had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus but these procedures were not successful and her headaches worsened. Earhart&#x27;s convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister&#x27;s home in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earhart passed the time reading poetry, learning to play the banjo, and studying mechanics. Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart&#x27;s flying and other activities in later life, and sometimes she was forced to wear a bandage on her cheek to cover a small drainage tube.

By 1919, Earhart prepared to enter Smith College, where her sister was a student, but she changed her mind and enrolled in a course of medical studies and other programs at Columbia University. Earhart quit her studies a year later to be with her parents, who had reunited in California.

=== Early flying experiences ===
In the early 1920s, Earhart and a young woman friend visited an air fair held in conjunction with the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto; she said: &quot;The interest, aroused in me, in Toronto, led me to all the air circuses in the vicinity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;forneymuseum/AmeliaEarhart&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I ace. The pilot saw Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dived at them. &quot;I am sure he said to himself, &#x27;Watch me make them scamper,&#x27;&quot; she said. Earhart stood her ground as the aircraft came close. &quot;I did not understand it at the time,&quot; she said, &quot;but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by.&quot;

On December 28, 1920, Earhart and her father attended an &quot;aerial meet&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/daily-pilot/2008-07-31-pipeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at Daugherty Field in Long Beach, California. She asked her father to ask about passenger flights and flying lessons. Earhart was booked for a passenger flight the following day at Emory Roger&#x27;s Field, at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. A 10-minute flight with Frank Hawks, who later gained fame as an air racer, cost $10. The ride with Hawkes changed Earhart&#x27;s life; she said: &quot;By the time I had got two or three hundred feet [60–90 m] off the ground ... I knew I had to fly.&quot;

The next month, Earhart engaged Neta Snook to be her flying instructor. The initial contract was for 12 hours of instruction for $500. Working at a variety of jobs, including photographer, truck driver, and stenographer at the local telephone company, Earhart saved $1,000 for flying lessons; she had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field on the west side of Long Beach Boulevard and Tweedy Road, now in the city of South Gate. For training, Snook used a crash-salvaged Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Canuck&quot; airplane she had restored for training. To reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus then walk . Earhart&#x27;s mother provided part of the $1,000 &quot;stake&quot; against her &quot;better judgement&quot;. Earhart cropped her hair short in the style of other female flyers. Six months later, in mid 1921 and against Snook&#x27;s advice, Earhart purchased a secondhand, chromium yellow Kinner Airster biplane, which she nicknamed &quot;The Canary&quot;. After her first successful solo landing, she bought a new leather flying coat. Due to the newness of the coat, she was subjected to teasing, so she aged it by sleeping in it and staining it with aircraft oil.

On October 22, 1922, Earhart flew the Airster to an altitude of , setting a world record for female pilots. On May 16, 1923, Earhart became the 16th woman in the United States to be issued a pilot&#x27;s license (#&quot;6017&quot;) by the &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; (FAI).
=== Financial problems and move to Massachusetts ===

Throughout the early 1920s, following a disastrous investment in a failed gypsum mine, Amelia Earhart&#x27;s inheritance from her grandmother, which her mother was now administering, steadily diminished until it was exhausted. Consequently, with no immediate prospect of recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the Canary and a second Kinner and bought a yellow Kissel Gold Bug &quot;Speedster&quot;, a two-seat automobile, and named it &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. Simultaneously, pain from Earhart&#x27;s old sinus problem worsened, and in early 1924, she was hospitalized for another sinus operation, which was again unsuccessful. She tried a number of ventures that included setting up a photography company.

Following her parents&#x27; divorce in 1924, Earhart drove her mother in &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the western United States and northward to Banff, Alberta, Canada. Their journey ended in Boston, Massachusetts, where Earhart underwent another, more-successful sinus operation. After recuperation, she returned to Columbia University for several months but was forced to abandon her studies and any further plans for enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), because her mother could no longer afford the tuition fees and associated costs. In 1925, Earhart found employment first as a teacher, then as a social worker at Denison House, a Boston settlement house. At this time, she lived in Medford, Massachusetts.

When Earhart lived in Medford, she maintained her interest in aviation, becoming a member of the American Aeronautical Society&#x27;s Boston chapter and eventually being elected its vice president. She flew out of Dennison Airport in Quincy, helped finance the airport&#x27;s operation by investing a small sum of money, and in 1927, she flew the first official flight out of Dennison Airport. Earhart worked as a sales representative for Kinner Aircraft in the Boston area and wrote local-newspaper columns promoting flying; as her local celebrity grew, Earhart made plans to launch an organization for female flyers.

== Aviation career and marriage ==
=== First woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 1928 ===
In 1928, Earhart became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an airplane. The project coordinators included publisher and publicist George P. Putnam, who later became her husband. She was a passenger, with the plane flown by Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon. On June 17, 1928, the team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m named &quot;Friendship&quot; and landed at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. The flight duration became the title to her book about the expedition &quot;20 Hrs. 40 Min.&quot;

Earhart had no training on this type of aircraft and did not pilot the plane. When interviewed after landing, she said: &quot;Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes ... maybe someday I&#x27;ll try it alone.&quot; Despite her feeling she gained international attention from the press and was greeted like a heroine.

On June 19, 1928, Earhart flew to Woolston, Southampton, England, where she received a rousing welcome. She had changed aircraft and flew an Avro Avian 594 Avian III, SN: R3/AV/101 that was owned by Irish aviator Lady Mary Heath, the first woman to hold a commercial flying licence in Britain. Earhart later acquired the aircraft and had it shipped to the United States.

When Stultz, Gordon, and Earhart returned to the United States on July 6, they were greeted with a ticker-tape parade along the Canyon of Heroes in Manhattan, followed by a reception with President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.

=== Celebrity status ===

When Earhart became famous, the press dubbed her &quot;Lady Lindy&quot;, because of her physical resemblance to the famous male aviator Charles Lindbergh and &quot;Queen of the Air&quot;. Immediately after her return to the United States, Earhart undertook an exhausting lecture tour in 1928 and 1929. Putnam had undertaken to heavily promote Earhart in a campaign that included publishing a book she wrote, a series of new lecture tours, and using pictures of her in media endorsements for products including luggage. A Lucky Strike cigarettes endorsement caused &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine to retract their offer. The money Earhart made from Lucky Strike had been intended to support Richard Evelyn Byrd&#x27;s imminent expedition to the South Pole.

The marketing campaign by both Earhart and Putnam was successful in establishing the Earhart mystique in the public psyche. Rather than simply endorsing the products, Earhart became involved in the promotions, especially in women&#x27;s fashions. The &quot;active living&quot; lines that were sold in stores such as Macy&#x27;s were an expression of Earhart&#x27;s new image. Her concept of simple, natural lines matched with wrinkle-proof, washable materials was the embodiment of a sleek, purposeful, but feminine &quot;A.E.&quot;, the familiar name she used with family and friends. Celebrity endorsements helped Earhart finance her flying.

=== Promoting aviation ===

Earhart accepted a position as associate editor at &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and used it to campaign for greater public acceptance of aviation, especially focusing on the role of women entering the field. In 1929, Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT) appointed Earhart and Margaret Bartlett Thornton to promote air travel, particularly for women, and Earhart helped set up the Ludington Airline, the first regional shuttle service between New York and Washington, D.C. Earhart was appointed Vice President of National Airways, which operated Boston-Maine Airways and several other airlines in the northeastern US, and by 1940 had become Northeast Airlines. In 1934, Earhart interceded on behalf of Isabel Ebel, who had helped Earhart in 1932, to be accepted as the first woman student of aeronautical engineering at New York University (NYU).

=== Competitive flying ===

In August 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. Her piloting skills and professionalism gradually grew, and she was acknowledged by experienced professional pilots who flew with her. General Leigh Wade, who flew with Earhart in 1929, said: &quot;She was a born flier, with a delicate touch on the stick.&quot;

Earhart made her first attempt at competitive air racing in 1929 during the first Santa Monica-to-Cleveland Women&#x27;s Air Derby (nicknamed the &quot;Powder Puff Derby&quot; by Will Rogers), which left Santa Monica, California, on August 18 and arrived at Cleveland, Ohio, on August 26. During the race, Earhart settled into fourth place in the &quot;heavy planes&quot; division. At the second-to-last stop at Columbus, Earhart&#x27;s friend Ruth Nichols, who was in third place, had an accident; her aircraft hit a tractor and flipped over, forcing her out of the race. At Cleveland, Earhart was placed third in the heavy division.

In 1930, Earhart became an official of the National Aeronautic Association, and in this role, she promoted the establishment of separate women&#x27;s records and was instrumental in persuading the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) to accept a similar international standard. On April 8, 1931, Earhart set a world altitude record of flying a Pitcairn PCA-2 autogyro she borrowed from the Beech-Nut Chewing Gum company.

During this period, Earhart became involved with Ninety-Nines, an organization of female pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation. In 1929, following the Women&#x27;s Air Derby, Earhart called a meeting of female pilots. She suggested the name based on the number of the charter members, and became the organization&#x27;s first president in 1930. Earhart was a vigorous advocate for female pilots; when the 1934 Bendix Trophy Race banned women from competing, Earhart refused to fly screen actor Mary Pickford to Cleveland to open the race.

=== Marriage to George Putnam ===

Earhart married her public relations manager George P. Putnam on February 7, 1931, in Putnam&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Noank, Connecticut, in what has been described as a marriage of convenience. Earhart had been engaged to Samuel Chapman, a chemical engineer from Boston, but she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times before she agreed to marry him. Earhart referred to her marriage as a &quot;partnership&quot; with &quot;dual control&quot;; in a letter to Putnam and hand-delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote: 
I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly ... I may have to keep some place where I can go to be by myself, now and then, for I cannot guarantee to endure at all times the confinement of even an attractive cage.

Earhart&#x27;s ideas on marriage were liberal for the time; she believed in equal responsibilities for both breadwinners and kept her own name rather than being referred to as &quot;Mrs. Putnam&quot;. When &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to her as &quot;Mrs. Putnam&quot;, she laughed it off. Putnam also learned he would be called &quot;Mr. Earhart&quot;. There was no honeymoon for the couple because Earhart was involved in a nine-day, cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour&#x27;s sponsor Beech-Nut chewing gum. Earhart and Putnam never had children but Putnam had two sons—the explorer and writer David Binney Putnam (1913–1992), and George Palmer Putnam Jr. (1921–2013)—from his previous marriage to Dorothy Binney (1888–1982), an heir to her father&#x27;s chemical company Binney &amp; Smith.

=== Transatlantic solo flight in 1932 ===

On May 20, 1932, 34-year-old Earhart set off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, with a copy of the &quot;Telegraph-Journal&quot;, given to her by journalist Stuart Trueman to confirm the date of the flight. She intended to fly to Paris in her single engine Lockheed Vega 5B to emulate Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight five years earlier. Her technical advisor for the flight was the Norwegian-American aviator Bernt Balchen, who helped prepare her aircraft and played the role of &quot;decoy&quot; for the press because he was ostensibly preparing Earhart&#x27;s Vega for his own Arctic flight. After a flight lasting 14 hours, 56 minutes, during which she contended with strong northerly winds, icy conditions and mechanical problems, Earhart landed in a pasture at Culmore, north of Derry, Northern Ireland. The landing was witnessed by Cecil King and T. Sawyer. When a farm hand asked, &quot;Have you flown far?&quot; Earhart replied, &quot;From America.&quot;

As the first woman to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic, Earhart received the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress, the Cross of Knight of the Legion of Honor from the French Government, and the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society from President Herbert Hoover. As her fame grew, Earhart developed friendships with many people in high offices, most notably First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who shared many of Earhart&#x27;s interests, especially women&#x27;s causes. After flying with Earhart, Roosevelt obtained a student permit but did not further pursue her plans to learn to fly. Earhart and Roosevelt frequently communicated with each other. Another flyer, Jacqueline Cochran, who was said to be Earhart&#x27;s rival, also became her confidante during this period.

=== Additional solo flights ===
On January 11, 1935, Earhart became the first aviator to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Oakland, California. This time, Earhart used a Lockheed 5C Vega. Although many aviators had attempted this transoceanic route, notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 Dole Air Race that had reversed the route, Earhart&#x27;s flight had been mainly routine with no mechanical breakdowns. In her final hours, she relaxed and listened to &quot;the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York&quot;.

On April 19, 1935, using her Lockheed Vega aircraft that she had named &quot;old Bessie, the fire horse&quot;, Earhart flew solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City. Earhart&#x27;s next record attempt was a nonstop flight from Mexico City to New York. After she set off on May 8, her flight was uneventful, although large crowds that greeted her at Newark, New Jersey, were a concern, because she had to be careful not to taxi into them.

Earhart again participated in the 1935 Bendix Trophy long-distance air race, finishing fifth, the best result she could manage because her stock Lockheed Vega, whose maximum speed was , was outclassed by purpose-built aircraft that reached more than . The race had been difficult because a competitor, Cecil Allen, died in a fire at takeoff, and Jacqueline Cochran was forced to pull out due to mechanical problems. In addition, &quot;blinding fog&quot; and violent thunderstorms plagued the race.

Between 1930 and 1935, Earhart set seven women&#x27;s speed-and-distance aviation records in a variety of aircraft, including the Kinner Airster, Lockheed Vega, and Pitcairn Autogiro. By 1935, recognizing the limitations of her &quot;lovely red Vega&quot; in long, transoceanic flights, Earhart contemplated a new &quot;prize ... one flight which I most wanted to attempt—a circumnavigation of the globe as near its waistline as could be.&quot; For the new venture, she would need a new aircraft.
=== Move from New York to California ===
In late November 1934, while Earhart was away on a speaking tour, a fire broke out at the Putnam residence in Rye, destroying many family treasures and Earhart&#x27;s personal mementos. Putnam had already sold his interest in the New York-based publishing company to his cousin Palmer Putnam. Following the fire, the couple decided to move to the west coast, where Putnam took up his new position as head of the editorial board of Paramount Pictures in North Hollywood.

At Earhart&#x27;s urging, in June 1935, Putnam purchased a small house in Toluca Lake, a San Fernando Valley celebrity enclave community between the Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures studio complexes, where they had earlier rented a temporary residence.

In September 1935, Earhart and Paul Mantz established a business partnership they had been considering since late 1934, and established the short-lived Earhart-Mantz Flying School, which Mantz controlled and operated through his aviation company United Air Services, which was based at Burbank Airport. Putnam handled publicity for the school, which primarily taught instrument flying using Link Trainers. Also in 1935, Earhart joined Purdue University as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to its Department of Aeronautics.

== World flight in 1937 ==
=== Planning ===

Early in 1936, Earhart started planning to fly around the world; if she succeeded, she would become the first woman to do so. Although others had flown around the world, Earhart&#x27;s flight would be the longest at 29,000 miles (47,000 km) because it followed a roughly equatorial route. Earhart planned to court publicity along the route to increase interest in a planned book about the expedition.

Purdue University established the Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research and gave $50,000 to fund the purchase of a Lockheed Electra 10E airplane. In July 1936, Lockheed Aircraft Company built the airplane, which was fitted with extra fuel tanks and other extensive modifications. Earhart dubbed the twin-engine monoplane her &quot;flying laboratory&quot;. The plane was built at Lockheed&#x27;s plant in Burbank, California, and after delivery, it was hangared at the nearby Mantz&#x27;s United Air Services.

Earhart chose Harry Manning as her navigator; he had been the captain of the , the ship that had transported Earhart from Europe in 1928. Manning was also a pilot and a skilled radio operator who knew Morse code.

The original plan was a two-person crew: Earhart would fly and Manning would navigate. During a flight across the US that included Earhart, Manning, and Putnam, Earhart flew using landmarks; she and Putnam knew where they were. Manning did a navigation fix that alarmed Putnam, because Manning made a minor navigational error that put them in the wrong state; they were flying close to the state line, but Putnam was still concerned. Sometime later, Putnam and Mantz arranged a night flight to test Manning&#x27;s navigational skill. Under poor navigational conditions, Manning&#x27;s position was off by . Elgen M. and Marie K. Long considered Manning&#x27;s performance reasonable, because it was within an acceptable error of , but Mantz and Putnam wanted a better navigator.

Through contacts in the Los Angeles aviation community, Fred Noonan was chosen as a second navigator, because there were significant additional factors that had to be dealt with while using celestial navigation for aircraft. Noonan, a licensed ship&#x27;s captain, was experienced in both marine and flight navigation; he had recently left Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), where he established most of the company&#x27;s China Clipper seaplane routes across the Pacific. Noonan had also been responsible for training Pan American&#x27;s navigators to fly the route between San Francisco and Manila. Under the original plans, Noonan would navigate from Hawaii to Howland Island—a difficult portion of the flight—then Manning would continue with Earhart to Australia, and she would proceed on her own for the remainder of the project.

=== Abandoned first attempt ===
On March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew set out on the first leg of her round-the-world flight, but they abandoned this attempt after a non-fatal crash that damaged the aircraft. The first leg of this attempt was between Oakland, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii. The crew were Earhart, Noonan, Manning, and Mantz, who was acting as Earhart&#x27;s technical advisor. Due to problems with the propeller hubs&#x27; variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing and was taken to the United States Navy&#x27;s Luke Field facility at Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field, with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. The next destination was Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific. Manning, the radio operator, had made arrangements to use radio direction finding to home in to the island. The flight never left Luke Field; during the takeoff run, there was an uncontrolled ground-loop, the forward landing gear collapsed, both propellers hit the ground, and the plane skidded on its belly. The cause of the crash is not known; some witnesses at Luke Field, including an Associated Press journalist, said they saw a tire blow. Earhart earlier thought the Electra&#x27;s right tire had blown and the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited an error by Earhart. With the aircraft severely damaged, the attempt was abandoned and the aircraft was shipped to Lockheed Burbank, California, for repairs.

===Second attempt===

While the Electra was being repaired, Earhart and Putnam secured additional funds and prepared for a second attempt, in which they would fly west to east. The second attempt began with an unpublicized flight from Oakland to Miami, Florida, and after arriving there, Earhart announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe. The flight&#x27;s opposite direction was partly the result of changes in global wind-and-weather patterns along the planned route since the earlier attempt.

Manning, the only skilled radio operator, had left the crew, which now consisted of Noonan and Earhart. The pair departed Miami on June 1 and after numerous stops in South America, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia, arrived at Lae, New Guinea, on June 29, 1937. At this stage, about 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of the journey had been completed. The remaining 7,000 miles (11,000 km) would be over the Pacific.

===Flight between Lae and Howland Island===
On &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T00:00Z&quot;&gt;July 2, 1937,&lt;/time&gt; at 10:00 am local time (12:00 am GMT), Earhart and Noonan took off from Lae Airfield in the heavily loaded Electra. Their destination was Howland Island, a flat sliver of land 6,500 ft (2,000 m) long and 1,600 ft (500 m) wide, 10 ft (3 m) high and away. The expected flying time was about 20 hours; accounting for the two-hour time-zone difference between Lae and Howland, and the crossing of the International Date Line, the aircraft was expected to arrive at Howland the morning of the next day, 2 July. The aircraft departed Lae with about of gasoline.

In preparation for the trip to Howland Island, the U.S. Coast Guard had sent the cutter to the island to offer communication and navigation support for the flight. The cutter was to communicate with Earhart&#x27;s aircraft via radio, transmit a homing signal to help the aviators locate Howland Island, use radio direction-finding (RDF), and use the cutter&#x27;s boilers to create a dark column of smoke that could be seen over the horizon. All of the navigation methods failed to guide Earhart to Howland Island.

Around &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T15:00+10:00&quot;&gt;3 pm Lae time&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart reported her altitude as , but that they would reduce altitude due to thick clouds. Around &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T17:00+10:00&quot;&gt;5 pm&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart reported her altitude as and speed as . During Earhart&#x27;s and Noonan&#x27;s approach to Howland Island, &quot;Itasca&quot; received strong, clear voice transmissions from Earhart identifying as KHAQQ, but she was unable to hear voice transmissions from the ship.

The first calls received from Earhart were routine reports stating the weather was cloudy and overcast at &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T02:45-11:30&quot; title=&quot;14:15Z&quot;&gt;2:45 am&lt;/time&gt; and just before &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T05:00-11:30&quot; title=&quot;16:30Z&quot;&gt;5 am on July 2&lt;/time&gt;. These calls were broken up by static, but at this point, the aircraft was a long distance from Howland. At &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T06:14-11:30&quot; title=&quot;17:44Z&quot;&gt;6:14 am&lt;/time&gt;, another call was received stating that the aircraft was within and requesting that the ship use its direction finder to provide a bearing for the aircraft. Earhart began whistling into the microphone to provide a continuous signal for the ship&#x27;s crew to use. At this point, the radio operators on &quot;Itasca&quot; realized their RDF system could not tune into the aircraft&#x27;s signal on 3105 kHz; radioman Leo Bellarts later commented he &quot;was sitting there sweating blood because I couldn&#x27;t do a darn thing about it&quot;. A similar call asking for a bearing was received at &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T06:45-11:30&quot; title=&quot;18:15Z&quot;&gt;6:45 am&lt;/time&gt;, when Earhart estimated they were away.

An &quot;Itasca&quot; radio log at 7:30–7:40 am states the aircraft had only a half hour of fuel remaining. A further radio log states they thought they were near &quot;Itasca&quot; but could not locate it and were flying at . In her transmission at &lt;time datetime=&quot;1937-07-02T07:58-11:30&quot; title=&quot;19:28Z&quot;&gt;7:58 am&lt;/time&gt;, Earhart said she could not hear &quot;Itasca&quot; and asked them to send voice signals so she could try to take a radio bearing. &quot;Itasca&quot; reported this signal as the loudest possible signal, indicating Earhart and Noonan were in the immediate area. The ship could not send voice at the frequency she asked for so they sent Morse code signals instead. Earhart acknowledged receiving these but said she was unable to determine their direction.

The last voice transmission received on Howland Island from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a line of position running north-to-south on 157–337 degrees, which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. After all contact with Howland Island was lost, attempts to reach the flyers with voice and Morse code transmissions were made. Operators across the Pacific and in the United States may have heard signals from the Electra but these were weak or unintelligible.

A series of misunderstandings, errors or mechanical failures are likely to have occurred on the final approach to Howland Island. Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of RDF in navigation. Another cited cause of possible confusion was that &quot;Itasca&quot; and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart; Earhart was using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and &quot;Itasca&quot; was using a Naval time-zone designation system.

Sources have noted Earhart&#x27;s apparent lack of understanding of her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix Corporation. Earhart&#x27;s only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory. A card displaying the antenna&#x27;s band settings was mounted so it was not visible. The Electra expected &quot;Itasca&quot; to transmit signals the Electra could use as an RDF beacon to find the ship. In theory, the plane could listen for the signal while rotating its loop antenna; a sharp minimum indicates the direction of the RDF beacon. The Electra&#x27;s RDF equipment had failed due to a blown fuse during an earlier leg flying to Darwin; the fuse was replaced. Near Howland, Earhart could hear the transmission from &quot;Itasca&quot; on 7500 kHz, but she was unable to determine a minimum so she could not determine a direction to the ship. Earhart was also unable to determine a minimum during an RDF test at Lae.

=== Disappearance ===
The U.S. government investigated the aircraft&#x27;s disappearance and, in its report, concluded Earhart&#x27;s plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean. During the 1970s, retired United States Navy (USN) captain Laurance Safford began a lengthy analysis of the flight. His research included the intricate radio-transmission documentation. Safford concluded the flight had suffered from poor planning and worse execution.

Many researchers believe Earhart and Noonan died during or shortly after the crash. In 1982, retired USN rear admiral Richard R. Black, who was in administrative charge of the Howland Island airstrip and was present in the radio room on &quot;Itasca&quot;, said: &quot;the Electra went into the sea about 10 am, July 2, 1937, not far from Howland.&quot; Earhart&#x27;s stepson George Palmer Putnam Jr. has said he believes &quot;the plane just ran out of gas&quot;. According to Earhart-biography author Susan Butler, the aircraft went into the ocean out of sight of Howland Island and rests on the seafloor at a depth of . Tom D. Crouch, senior curator of the National Air and Space Museum, has said the Electra is &quot;18,000 ft. down&quot; and compared its archaeological significance to that of &quot;RMS Titanic&quot;.

British aviation historian Roy Nesbit interpreted evidence in contemporary accounts and Putnam&#x27;s correspondence and concluded Earhart&#x27;s Electra was not fully fueled at Lae. William L. Polhemous, the navigator on Ann Pellegreno&#x27;s 1967 flight that followed Earhart and Noonan&#x27;s original flight path, studied navigational tables for July 2, 1937, and thought Noonan may have miscalculated the &quot;single line approach&quot; to Howland.

===Search efforts===

Beginning approximately one hour after Earhart&#x27;s last recorded message, &quot;Itasca&quot; undertook an unsuccessful search north and west of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The U.S. Navy joined the search and over about three days sent available resources to the search area near Howland Island. Official search efforts lasted until July 19, 1937. At $4 million, the air-and-sea search by the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard was the costliest and most-intensive in U.S. history up to that time. Despite the unprecedented search, no physical evidence of Earhart, Noonan, or the Electra 10E was found.

On the mornings of July 3 and July 6, 1937, an Oakland radio amateur was reported to have heard emergency transmissions, seemingly from Earhart. In the days after their last confirmed transmissions, further transmissions purporting to be from Earhart were reported, many of which were determined to be hoaxes. The captain of later said: &quot;There was no doubt many stations calling the Earhart plane on the plane&#x27;s frequency, some by voice and others by signals. All of these added to the confusion and doubtfulness of the authenticity of the reports.&quot;

Immediately after the end of the official search, Putnam financed a private search by local authorities of nearby Pacific islands and waters. In late July 1937, Putnam chartered two small boats and, while he remained in the United States, directed a search of other islands. Putnam acted to become the trustee of Earhart&#x27;s estate so he could pay for the searches and related bills. In probate court in Los Angeles, Putnam asked to have the &quot;declared death &quot;in absentia&quot;&quot; seven-year waiting period waived so he could manage Earhart&#x27;s finances. As a result, Earhart was declared legally dead on January 5, 1939.

In 2003 and 2006, David Jourdan, through his company Nauticos, extensively searched a area north and west of Howland Island with deep-sea sonar devices. The searches cost $4.5 million but did not find any wreckage. The search locations were derived from the line of position (157–337) broadcast by Earhart on July 2, 1937.

In 2024, Deep Sea Vision, a Charleston, South Carolina, company that operates unmanned underwater vehicles, found via sonar what it said could be the remains of Earhart&#x27;s airplane on the ocean floor. The object, which was deep and about from Howland Island, turned out to be a rock formation.

== Speculation on disappearance ==

While most historians believe Earhart crashed and sank in the Pacific Ocean, a number of other possibilities have been proposed, including several conspiracy theories. The Gardner Island hypothesis supposes Earhart and Noonan were unable to find Howland Island and continued south. Gardner island, one of the Phoenix Islands that is now known as Nikumaroro, has been the subject of inquiry as a possible crash-landing site but, despite numerous expeditions, no link between Earhart and the island has ever been found.

The Japanese capture theory assumes Japanese forces captured Earhart and Noonan after they navigated to the Japanese South Seas Mandate. A number of Earhart&#x27;s relatives have been convinced the Japanese were somehow involved in her disappearance, citing unnamed witnesses including Japanese troops and Saipan natives.

The New Britain theory assumes Earhart turned back mid-flight and tried to reach the airfield at Rabaul, New Britain, northeast of mainland Papua New Guinea, approximately from Howland Island. In 1990, Donald Angwin, a veteran of the Australian Army&#x27;s World War II New Britain campaign, reported that in 1945 he had seen a wrecked aircraft in the jungle that may have been Earhart&#x27;s Electra. Subsequent searches of the area failed to find any wreckage.

In November 2006, National Geographic Channel aired an episode of its series &quot;Undiscovered History&quot; that supposed Earhart survived the world flight, changed her name, remarried, and became Irene Craigmile Bolam. This claim had originally been published in the book &quot;Amelia Earhart Lives&quot; (1970), which is based on the research of Joseph Gervais. Shortly after the book&#x27;s publication, Bolam filed a lawsuit requesting $1.5 million in damages and the book&#x27;s publisher McGraw-Hill withdrew it from the market; court records indicate the company reached an out-of-court settlement with her.

== Legacy ==
During her life, Earhart embraced celebrity culture and women&#x27;s rights, and since her disappearance, she has become a global cultural icon. Countless tributes and memorials have been made in Amelia Earhart&#x27;s name, including a 2012 tribute by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said at a State Department event celebrating the ties of Earhart and the United States to its Pacific neighbors: &quot;Earhart ... created a legacy that resonates today for anyone, girls and boys, who dreams of the stars&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked Earhart No. 9 on its list of the &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot;.

Earhart was a widely known, international celebrity during her lifetime. Her shyly charismatic appeal, independence, persistence, coolness under pressure, courage and goal-oriented career, along with the circumstances of her disappearance at a comparatively early age, have driven her lasting fame in popular culture. Hundreds of articles and scores of books have been written about her life, which is often cited as a motivational tale, especially for girls. Earhart is generally regarded as a feminist icon.

Earhart&#x27;s accomplishments in aviation inspired a generation of female aviators, including more-than 1,000 female pilots of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), who served during World War II.

The home where Earhart was born is now the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum and is maintained by Ninety-Nines, an international group of female pilots of which Earhart was the first elected president. The Amelia Earhart Festival has taken place in Atchison, Kansas, every year since 1996.

===Tributes and memorials===
====Tributary flights====
In 1967, Ann Pellegreno flew a similar aircraft to Earhart&#x27;s, a Lockheed 10A Electra, to complete a round-the-world flight that followed Earhart&#x27;s flight plan. On the 30th anniversary of her disappearance, Pellegreno dropped a wreath over Howland island in Earhart&#x27;s honor.

In 1997, on the 60th anniversary of Earhart&#x27;s round-the-world flight, San Antonio businesswoman Linda Finch retraced the final flight path, flying a restored 1935 Lockheed Electra 10, the same make and model of aircraft as Earhart&#x27;s.

In 2001, another commemorative flight retraced the route Earhart flew in her August 1928 transcontinental record flight; Carlene Mendieta flew an original Avro Avian, the same type of aircraft that was used in 1928.

====Buildings and structures====
In 1942, a United States Liberty ship named was launched; it was wrecked in 1948. &quot;USNS Amelia Earhart&quot; was named in her honor in May 2007.

In 1964, Purdue University opened Earhart Hall in honor of her legacy and contribution to the university during her time as a career counselor for female students and technical advisor for the aeronautics department. In 2009, Purdue erected a bronze statue of Earhart holding a propeller in front of the residence hall named after her. The university board recently approved plans to name the new Purdue University Airport terminal the Amelia Earhart Terminal.

The Earhart Light, also known as the Amelia Earhart Light, is a navigational day beacon on Howland Island, where she was due to land before she went missing. It is no longer operational. Amelia Earhart Airport in Atchison, Kansas, was named in her honor.

Amelia Earhart Dam on Mystic River in eastern Massachusetts is named in her honor. The &quot;Earhart Tree&quot; on Banyan Drive in Hilo, Hawaii, was planted by Earhart in 1935.

====Other tributes====
The Amelia Earhart Commemorative Stamp (8¢ airmail postage) was issued in 1963 by the United States Postmaster-General.

Earhart was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1992.

A full-sized bronze statue of Amelia Earhart was placed at the Spirit of Flight Center in Lafayette, Colorado, in 2008. A statue by Ernest Shelton was erected circa 1971 in Los Angeles, California.

A small section of Earhart&#x27;s Lockheed Electra starboard engine nacelle that was recovered following the March 1937 Hawaii crash has been confirmed as authentic and is now regarded as a control piece that will help authenticate possible future discoveries.

== In popular culture ==
Amelia Earhart&#x27;s life has been the subject of many writers; the following collection of examples make no claims of completeness:

===Novels and plays===
*In the 2021 alternate history novella &quot;Or Even Eagle Flew&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Earhart does not go missing in 1937 and later joins the Eagle Squadrons of the British Royal Air Force to fight against the Nazis in World War II.
*The events surrounding Earhart and Noonan&#x27;s disappearance are dramatized in the 1996 novel &quot;I Was Amelia Earhart&quot; by Jane Mendelsohn.
*In 2011, the Great Canadian Theatre Company hosted a musical play titled &quot;Amelia: The Girl Who Wants To Fly&quot;. This is one of numerous plays on the subject.

===Film and television===
*The Rosalind Russell film &quot;Flight for Freedom&quot; (1943) was derived from a treatment of &quot;Stand by to Die&quot;, a fictionalized treatment of Earhart&#x27;s life. 
*&quot;Amelia Earhart: The Price of Courage&quot; (1993) is an &quot;American Experience&quot; television documentary. 
*&quot;Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight&quot; (1994) starring Diane Keaton, Rutger Hauer, and Bruce Dern, was initially released as a television movie and subsequently rereleased as a theatrical feature.
*The events surrounding Earhart and Noonan&#x27;s disappearance are dramatized in the science fiction television show &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, episode &quot;The 37&#x27;s&quot; (1995), with Sharon Lawrence portraying Earhart.
*In the biopic film &quot;Amelia&quot; (2009), Earhart is portrayed by Hilary Swank.
*In the 2009 American fantasy comedy film &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; Earhart is portrayed by Amy Adams.

===Music===

*Plainsong released a tribute album, &quot;In Search of Amelia Earhart&quot; (Elektra K42120), in 1972. Both the album and the Press Pak released by Elektra have become collectables and have gained a cult status. 
*Singer Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;Amelia&quot; appears on her album &quot;Hejira&quot; (1976) and it also features in the video of her 1980 live album &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; (1980) with clips of Earhart. Commenting on the origins of the song, which interweaves the story of a desert journey with aspects of Earhart&#x27;s disappearance, Mitchell said: &quot;I was thinking of Amelia Earhart and addressing it from one solo pilot to another ... sort of reflecting on the cost of being a woman and having something you must do&quot;.
*The 2024 Public Service Broadcasting album &quot;The Last Flight&quot; tells the story of Earhart&#x27;s final flight.

===Other===

== Books by Earhart ==
Earhart was a successful and heavily promoted writer who served as aviation editor for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; from 1928 to 1930. She wrote magazine articles, newspaper columns, and essays, and published two books based upon her experiences as a flyer during her lifetime:
* &quot;20 Hrs. 40 Min.&quot; (1928) is a journal of her experiences as the first woman passenger on a transatlantic flight.
* &quot;The Fun of It&quot; (1932) is a memoir of her flying experiences and an essay on women in aviation.
* &quot;Last Flight&quot; (1937) features the periodic journal entries she sent to the United States during her round-the-world flight attempt, and was published in newspapers in the weeks prior to her departure from New Guinea. The journal was compiled by Earhart&#x27;s husband GP Putnam after her disappearance over the Pacific. Many historians consider this book to be only partially Earhart&#x27;s original work.

<doc id="85241" wikidata="Q666620" url="?curid=85241" title="Elmo Zumwalt">
<text>Elmo Russell &quot;Bud&quot; Zumwalt Jr. (November 29, 1920 – January 2, 2000) was a United States Navy officer and the youngest person to serve as Chief of Naval Operations. As an admiral and later the 19th Chief of Naval Operations, Zumwalt played a major role in United States military history, especially during the Vietnam War. A decorated war veteran, Zumwalt reformed United States Navy personnel policies in an effort to improve enlisted life and ease racial tensions. After he retired from a 32-year navy career, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate.

==Early life and education==
Zumwalt was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Elmo Russell Zumwalt, and his wife, Frances Pearl (née Frank) Zumwalt, both country doctors. Frances was raised Jewish, the daughter of Julius and Sarah Frank of Burlington, Vermont. His family moved to Tulare, California, where he grew up. She became estranged from her parents for marrying outside the faith, as the Zumwalts were Christians.

Zumwalt, an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America, attended Tulare Union High School in Tulare, California, where he became the valedictorian, and Rutherford Preparatory School in Long Beach, California.

==Naval career==
===Naval Academy and World War II===
Zumwalt had planned to become a doctor like his parents, but in 1939, he was accepted to the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland. As a midshipman at the USNA, he was president of the Trident Society, vice president of the Quarterdeck Society and the two-time winner of the June Week Public Speaking Contest (1940–41). Zumwalt also participated in intercollegiate debating and was a Company Commander (1941) and Regimental Three Striper (1942). He graduated with distinction and was commissioned as an ensign on June 19, 1942. He also received an honorary degree from Texas Tech University.

Zumwalt was assigned to , a destroyer. In August 1943, &quot;Phelps&quot; was detached for instruction in the Operational Training Command-Pacific in San Francisco. In January 1944, Zumwalt reported for duty on board . On this ship, he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor device for &quot;heroic service as Evaluator in the Combat Information Center ... in action against enemy Japanese battleships during the Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 25, 1944&quot;.

After the end of World War II in August 1945, Zumwalt continued to serve until December 8, 1945, as the prize crew officer of the &quot;Ataka&quot;, a 1,200-ton Japanese river gunboat with a crew of 200. In this capacity, he took the first American-controlled ship since the outbreak of World War II up the Huangpu River to Shanghai, China. There, they helped to restore order and assisted in disarming the Japanese.

===Command assignments===
Zumwalt next served as executive officer of the destroyer , and in March 1946, was transferred to the destroyer , as executive officer and navigator.

In January 1948, Zumwalt was assigned to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps unit of the University of North Carolina, where he remained until June 1950. That same month, he assumed command of , a destroyer escort that was commissioned in a reserve status. The &quot;Tills&quot; was placed in full active commission at Charleston Naval Shipyard on November 21, 1950, and he continued to command her until March 1951, when he joined the battleship as navigator and served with the ship in operations in Korea.

Detached from USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; in June 1952, he attended the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, and in June 1953, he reported as head of the Shore and Overseas Bases Section, Bureau of Naval Personnel, Navy Department, Washington, D.C. He also served as officer and enlisted requirements officer, and as action officer on Medicare legislation. Completing that tour of duty in July 1955, he assumed command of the destroyer , participating in two deployments with the United States Seventh Fleet. In this assignment, he was commended by the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Forces, United States Pacific Fleet, for winning the Battle Efficiency Competition for his ship and for winning Excellence Awards in Engineering, Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and Operations. In July 1957, he returned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel for further duty. In December 1957, he was transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Personnel and Reserve Forces), and served as special assistant for naval personnel until November 1958, then as special assistant and naval aide until August 1959.

Ordered to the first ship built from the keel up as a guided missile frigate, , built at the Bath (Maine) Iron Works, he assumed command of that frigate at her commissioning in December 1959, and commanded it until June 1961. During the period of his command, &quot;Dewey&quot; earned the Excellence Award in Engineering, Supply, Weapons, and was runner-up in the Battle Efficiency Competition. He was a student at the National War College, Washington, D.C., during the 1961–1962 class year. In June 1962, he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), Washington, D.C., where he served first as desk officer for France, Spain, and Portugal, then as director of arms control and contingency planning for Cuba. From December 1963 until June 21, 1965, he served as executive assistant and senior aide to the Honorable Paul H. Nitze, Secretary of the Navy. For duty in his tour in the offices of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy, he was awarded the Legion of Merit.

===Flag assignments===
====Vietnam====
After his selection for the rank of rear admiral, Zumwalt assumed command of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Seven on 24 July 1965 in San Diego. He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, OPNAV (OP-96) from August 1966 to August 1968. In September 1968, he became Commander Naval Forces Vietnam and Chief of the Naval Advisory Group, United States Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and was promoted to vice admiral in October 1968. Zumwalt was the Navy adviser to General Creighton Abrams, Commander, MACV. Zumwalt always spoke very highly of Abrams, and said that Abrams was the most caring officer he had ever known.

Zumwalt&#x27;s command was not a blue-water force, like the Seventh Fleet; it was a brown-water unit: he commanded the flotilla of Swift Boats that patrolled the coasts, harbors, and rivers of Vietnam. Among the swift-boat commanders were his son Elmo Russell Zumwalt III and later future senator and secretary of state John Kerry. Among his other forces were Task Force 115, the Coastal Surveillance Force, Task Force 116, the River Patrol Force and Task Force 117, the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force.

====Chief of Naval Operations====

President Richard Nixon nominated Zumwalt to be Chief of Naval Operations in April 1970. Upon being relieved as Commander Naval Forces Vietnam on May 15, 1970, he was awarded a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for exceptionally meritorious service.

Zumwalt assumed duties as Chief of Naval Operations and was promoted to full admiral on July 1, 1970, and quickly began a series of moves intended to reduce racism and sexism in the Navy. These were disseminated in Navy-wide communications known as &quot;Z-grams&quot;. These included orders authorizing beards (sideburns, mustaches, and longer groomed hair were also acceptable) and introducing beer-dispensing machines to barracks.

Zumwalt instituted the &#x27;Mod Squad&#x27;—Destroyer Squadron 26 and later 31—to give promising young officers early command experience. Billets were a rank lower than normal.

Zumwalt reshaped the Navy&#x27;s effort to replace large numbers of aging World War II-era vessels, a plan called &quot;High-Low&quot;. Instituted over the resistance of Admiral Hyman Rickover and others, High-Low sought to balance the purchase of high-end, nuclear-powered vessels with low-end, cheaper ones—such as the Sea Control Ship—that could be bought in greater numbers. Rickover, the &#x27;Father of the Nuclear Navy&#x27;, preferred buying a few major ships to buying many ordinary ones. Zumwalt proposed four kinds of warships to fit the plan; in the end, only the of missile patrol boats and the of guided missile frigates became reality, and only six of the planned 100+ &quot;Pegasus&quot;-class hydrofoils were built. The &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class stood as the most numerous class of United States&#x27; warships since World War II until the advent of the s. Zumwalt was the last Chief of Naval Operations to live at Number One Observatory Circle before it became the official residence of the vice president. For Zumwalt, not pleased with the choice, this was reason enough to challenge Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. in the 1976 Senate election in Virginia.

Elmo Zumwalt Jr. retired from the Navy on July 1, 1974, aged 53.

==Later years==
After he retired, Zumwalt wrote &quot;On Watch: a Memoir&quot;, published by Quadrangle Books in 1976. It reviews his Navy career and includes reprints of all the Z-grams he issued as CNO.

Also in 1976, Zumwalt unsuccessfully ran as a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate from Virginia, and was defeated by incumbent independent senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. by a 57% to 38% result. Later, he held the presidency of the American Medical Building Corporation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

While serving in Shanghai in 1945, Zumwalt met and married Mouza Coutelais-du-Roche, whose French-Russian family was living there. She returned with him to the United States. They had four children: Elmo Russell Zumwalt III; James Gregory Zumwalt; Ann F. Zumwalt Coppola; and Mouzetta C. Zumwalt-Weathers.

Zumwalt&#x27;s eldest son, Elmo Zumwalt III, served as a lieutenant on one of Zumwalt&#x27;s patrol boats during the Vietnam War. In January 1983, he was diagnosed with lymphoma, and in 1985 it was then discovered he also had Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. In addition, his grandson Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV had been born in 1977 with learning disabilities. Admiral Zumwalt and his family were convinced that both son and grandson were victims of Agent Orange, which the admiral had ordered to be sprayed over the Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive &quot;the Viet Cong back 1,000 yards off the water&#x27;s edge&quot;.

In an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1986, Elmo Zumwalt III said:
Admiral Zumwalt and his son collaborated with writer John Pekkanen to create the book &quot;My Father, My Son&quot;, published by MacMillan in September 1986, where they discussed the family tragedy of his son&#x27;s battle with cancer. In 1988, the book was made into a TV movie with the same name, starring Karl Malden as the admiral and Keith Carradine as his son. Elmo Zumwalt III died as the result of his cancer on August 14, 1988, at the age of 42, three months after the TV movie was shown.

During his son&#x27;s illness in the early 1980s, Admiral Zumwalt was very active in lobbying Congress to establish a national registry of bone marrow donors. Such donors serve patients who do not have suitably matched bone marrow donors in their families. Though his son ultimately was able to receive a transplant from his own sister, many patients do not have close relatives who are able and willing to help in this way. As such, his efforts were a major factor in the founding of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) in July 1986. Admiral Zumwalt was the first chairman of the NMDP&#x27;s board of directors.

In his later years, Zumwalt resided in Arlington County, Virginia.

==Death and legacy==

Zumwalt died on January 2, 2000, aged 79, at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, from mesothelioma. His funeral service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel. In his eulogy President Bill Clinton called Zumwalt &quot;the conscience of the United States Navy&quot;.

The United States Navy&#x27;s DD(X) guided missile destroyer program has been named the Zumwalt class in his honor, and its lead ship, , bears his name by Navy tradition.

In 2013, the Mesothelioma Center for Excellence at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center was renamed the Elmo Zumwalt Treatment &amp; Research Center. It specializes in mesothelioma research, particularly for veterans who may have been exposed to asbestos during their service.

<doc id="85248" wikidata="Q191760" url="?curid=85248" title="Theatre of the absurd">
<text>The theatre of the absurd ( ) is a post–World War II designation for particular plays of absurdist fiction written by a number of primarily European playwrights in the late 1950s. It is also a term for the style of theatre the plays represent. The plays focus largely on ideas of existentialism and express what happens when human existence lacks meaning or purpose and communication breaks down. The structure of the plays is typically a round shape, with the finishing point the same as the starting point. Logical construction and argument give way to irrational and illogical speech and to the ultimate conclusion—silence.

==Etymology==
Critic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot;, which begins by focusing on the playwrights Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, and Eugène Ionesco. Esslin says that their plays have a common denominator—the &quot;absurd&quot;, a word that Esslin defines with a quotation from Ionesco: &quot;absurd is that which has no purpose, or goal, or objective.&quot; The French philosopher Albert Camus, in his 1942 work &quot;Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, describes the human situation as meaningless and absurd.

The absurd in these plays takes the form of man&#x27;s reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Eugène Ionesco play &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; (1950). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the &quot;well-made play&quot;.

In his introduction to the book &quot;Absurd Drama&quot; (1965), Esslin wrote:The Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.

== Origin ==
In the first edition of &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot;, Esslin quotes the French philosopher Albert Camus&#x27;s essay &quot;Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, as it uses the word &quot;absurdity&quot; to describe the human situation: &quot;In a universe that is suddenly deprived of illusions and of light, man feels a stranger. … This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, truly constitutes the feeling of Absurdity.&quot;

Esslin presents the four defining playwrights of the movement as Samuel Beckett, Arthur Adamov, Eugène Ionesco, and Jean Genet, and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, Harold Pinter. Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Fernando Arrabal, Edward Albee, Boris Vian, and Jean Tardieu.

== Precursors ==
=== Tragicomedy ===
The mode of most &quot;absurdist&quot; plays is tragicomedy. As Nell says in &quot;Endgame&quot;, &quot;Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it&#x27;s the most comical thing in the world&quot;. Esslin cites William Shakespeare as an influence on this aspect of the &quot;absurd drama&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;Macbett&quot; and Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay &quot;Problems of the Theatre&quot;, &quot;Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not. We can achieve the tragic out of comedy. We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises.&quot;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, theatre of the absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from Commedia dell&#x27;arte to vaudeville. Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and music hall artists such as Charlie Chaplin, the Keystone Cops and Buster Keaton as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Film&quot; in 1965.)

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many theatre of the absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the theatre of the absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as Lewis Carroll or Edward Lear; Polish playwright Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz; the Russians Daniil Kharms, Nikolai Erdman, and others; Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s distancing techniques in his &quot;epic theatre&quot;; and the &quot;dream plays&quot; of August Strindberg.

One commonly cited precursor is Luigi Pirandello, especially &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the fourth wall presupposed by the realism of playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen. According to W. B. Worthen, &quot;Six Characters&quot; and other Pirandello plays use &quot;metatheatre—roleplaying, plays-within-plays, and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of identity&quot;.

Another influential playwright was Guillaume Apollinaire whose &quot;The Breasts of Tiresias&quot; was the first work to be called &quot;surreal&quot;.

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
A precursor is Alfred Jarry whose &quot;Ubu&quot; plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of &#x27;pataphysics—&quot;the science of imaginary solutions&quot;—first presented in Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien&quot; (&quot;Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician&quot;) was inspirational to many later absurdists, some of whom joined the Collège de &#x27;pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948 (Ionesco, Arrabal, and Vian were given the title &quot;transcendent satrape of the Collège de &#x27;pataphysique&quot;). The Theatre Alfred Jarry, founded by Antonin Artaud and Roger Vitrac, housed several absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.

In the 1860s, a gaucho author established himself as a precursor of the theater of the absurd in Brazilian lands. Qorpo-Santo, pseudonym of José Joaquim de Campos Leão, released during the last years of his life several theatrical works that can be classified as precursors of the theater of the absurd. However, he is little known, even in his homeland, but works such as &quot;Mateus e Mateusa&quot; are gradually being rediscovered by scholars in Brazil and around the world.

Artaud&#x27;s &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot; (presented in &quot;Theatre and its Double&quot;) was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre&#x27;s reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact. Artaud was a surrealist, and many other members of the surrealist group were significant influences on the absurdists.

Absurdism is also frequently compared to surrealism&#x27;s predecessor, Dadaism (for example, the Dadaist plays by Tristan Tzara performed at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich). Many of the absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and surrealists. Ionesco, Adamov, and Arrabal for example, were friends with surrealists still living in Paris at the time including Paul Eluard and André Breton, the founder of surrealism, and Beckett translated many surrealist poems by Breton and others from French into English.

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the absurdists were contemporaries with Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few absurdists actually committed to Sartre&#x27;s own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, and many of the absurdists had a complicated relationship with him. Sartre praised Genet&#x27;s plays, stating that for Genet, &quot;Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good&quot;.

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by communists; he wrote &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros. Sartre criticized &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; by questioning: &quot;Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there.&quot; Sartre&#x27;s criticism highlights a primary difference between the theatre of the absurd and existentialism: the theatre of the absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, , comparing the absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, &quot;It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion.&quot; Ionesco replied, &quot;I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language.&quot;

In comparison to Sartre&#x27;s concepts of the function of literature, Beckett&#x27;s primary focus was on the &quot;failure&quot; of man to overcome &quot;absurdity&quot; - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in &quot;Damned to Fame&quot;, Beckett&#x27;s work focuses, &quot;on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a &#x27;non-knower&#x27; and as a &#x27;non-can-er&#x27; .&quot; Beckett&#x27;s own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre&#x27;s journal &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;. Beckett said, though he liked &quot;Nausea&quot;, he generally found the writing style of Sartre and Heidegger to be &quot;too philosophical&quot; and he considered himself &quot;not a philosopher&quot;.

== History ==
The &quot;absurd&quot; or &quot;new theater&quot; movement was originally a Paris-based (and a Rive Gauche) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theatres in the Quartier Latin. Some of the absurdists, such as Jean Genet, Jean Tardieu, and Boris Vian., were born in France. Many other absurdists were born elsewhere but lived in France, writing often in French: Beckett from Ireland; Ionesco from Romania; Arthur Adamov from Russia; Alejandro Jodorowsky from Chile and Fernando Arrabal from Spain. As the influence of the absurdists grew, the style spread to other countries—with playwrights either directly influenced by absurdists in Paris or playwrights labelled absurdist by critics. In England, some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the theatre of the absurd include Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, N. F. Simpson, James Saunders, and David Campton; in the United States, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, Jack Gelber, and John Guare; in Poland, Tadeusz Różewicz; Sławomir Mrożek, and Tadeusz Kantor; in Italy, Dino Buzzati; and in Germany, Peter Weiss, Wolfgang Hildesheimer, and Günter Grass. In India, both Mohit Chattopadhyay and Mahesh Elkunchwar have also been labeled absurdists. Other international absurdist playwrights include Tawfiq el-Hakim from Egypt; Hanoch Levin from Israel; Miguel Mihura from Spain; José de Almada Negreiros from Portugal; Mikhail Volokhov from Russia; Yordan Radichkov from Bulgaria; and playwright and former Czech president Václav Havel.

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical. The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections. According to Martin Esslin, absurdism is &quot;the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose&quot; Absurdist drama asks its viewer to &quot;draw his own conclusions, make his own errors&quot;. Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood&quot;. Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of &quot;absurd&quot; (&quot;out of harmony&quot; in the musical sense) and drama&#x27;s understanding of the absurd: &quot;Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.&quot;

=== Characters ===
The characters in absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate. Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in &quot;The Chairs&quot; &quot;übermarionettes&quot;). Characters are frequently stereotypical, archetypal, or flat character types as in Commedia dell&#x27;arte.

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible. Many of Pinter&#x27;s plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character cannot understand. Pinter&#x27;s first play was &quot;The Room&quot; – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery. In Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;The Visit,&quot; the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world, with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred. Characters in absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco&#x27;s recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in &quot;The Killer&quot;, and Berenger&#x27;s logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong. In &quot;Rhinocéros&quot;, Berenger remains the only human on Earth who has not turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform. Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, for example, find themselves in a story (&quot;Hamlet&quot;) in which the outcome has already been written.

The plots of many absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the &quot;pseudocouple&quot;. The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; or the two main characters in &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; or Hamm and Clov in &quot;Endgame&quot;); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Lesson&quot; or in many of Albee&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in absurdist plays is naturalistic. The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the theatre of the absurd distinctive. Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness. Tardieu, for example, in the series of short pieces &quot;Theatre de Chambre&quot; arranged the language as one arranges music. Distinctively absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense. &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;, for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection. Likewise, the characters in &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;—like many other absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection. In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of absurdist theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage. Many of Beckett&#x27;s plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau. Harold Pinter—famous for his &quot;Pinter pause&quot;—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes. The following exchange between Aston and Davies in &quot;The Caretaker&quot; is typical of Pinter:

:Aston: More or less exactly what you...
:Davies: That&#x27;s it … that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (&quot;Pause&quot;.)
:Aston: Well, there&#x27;s things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:Davies: But it&#x27;d be a matter … wouldn&#x27;t it … it&#x27;d be a matter of a broom … isn&#x27;t it?

Much of the dialogue in absurdist drama (especially in Beckett&#x27;s and Albee&#x27;s plays) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection. When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection. It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky&#x27;s long speech in &quot;Godot&quot; when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for &quot;thinking&quot; as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:Lucky: Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and non-sequiturs:

:Goldberg: What do you use for pajamas?
:Stanley: Nothing.
:Goldberg: You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:Mccann: What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:Goldberg: Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:Mccann: What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:Goldberg: Speak up Webber. Why did the chicken cross the road?

As in the above examples, nonsense in absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth. In Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Lesson&quot;, a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:Professor: … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic. Do you detect the difference? Translate this into … Romanian
:Pupil: The … how do you say &quot;roses&quot; in Romanian?
:Professor: But &quot;roses&quot;, what else? … &quot;roses&quot; is a translation in Oriental of the French word &quot;roses&quot;, in Spanish &quot;roses&quot;, do you get it? In Sardanapali, &quot;roses&quot;...

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in the theatre of the absurd. Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in &quot;Godot&quot; or &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;. Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why. In later Pinter plays, such as &quot;The Caretaker&quot; and &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Albee&#x27;s &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;: Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends, Agnes and Tobias, because they suddenly become frightened. They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:Harry: There was nothing … but we were very scared.
:Edna: We … were … terrified.
:Harry: We were scared. It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost. There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:Edna: We were frightened … and there was nothing.

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many absurdist plots: for example, in &quot;The Chairs&quot;, an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible, so all we see are empty chairs, a representation of their absence. Likewise, the action of &quot;Godot&quot; is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait. In many of Beckett&#x27;s later plays, most features are stripped away and what&#x27;s left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in &quot;Footfalls&quot;, for example, or in &quot;Breath&quot; only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics. For example, in Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It&quot;, a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it is continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away. In Tardieu&#x27;s &quot;The Keyhole&quot; a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.

Like Pirandello, many absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre. This is true for many of Genet&#x27;s plays: for example, in &quot;The Maids&quot;, two maids pretend to be their mistress; in &quot;The Balcony&quot; brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur. Another complex example of this is &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&quot;: it is a play about two minor characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, the play-within-the-play in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Travesties&quot;, James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

Plots are frequently cyclical: for example, &quot;Endgame&quot; begins where the play ended – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, &quot;Finished, it&#x27;s finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished&quot; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.

<text>Armand Jean du Plessis, 1st Duke of Richelieu (9 September 1585 – 4 December 1642), known as Cardinal Richelieu, was a French Catholic prelate and statesman who had an outsized influence in civil and religious affairs. He became known as the Red Eminence (), a term derived from the style of Eminence applied to cardinals and their customary red robes.

Consecrated a bishop in 1607, Richelieu was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1616. He continued to rise through the hierarchy of both the Catholic Church and the French government, becoming a cardinal in 1622 and chief minister to King Louis XIII of France in 1624. He retained that office until his death in 1642, when he was succeeded by Cardinal Jules Mazarin, whose career the cardinal had fostered. Richelieu became engaged in a bitter dispute with Marie de Médici, the king&#x27;s mother, and formerly his close ally.

Richelieu sought to consolidate royal power and restrained the power of the nobility in order to transform France into a strong centralized state. In foreign policy, his primary objectives were to check the power of the Habsburg dynasty (reigning notably in Spain and Austria) and to ensure French dominance in the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648 after that conflict engulfed Europe. Despite suppressing the Huguenot rebellions of the 1620s, he made alliances with Protestant states like the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic to help him achieve his goals. Although he was a powerful political figure in his own right, events such as the Day of the Dupes () in 1630 showed that Richelieu&#x27;s power still depended on the king&#x27;s confidence.

An alumnus of the University of Paris and headmaster of the College of Sorbonne, Richelieu renovated and extended the institution. He became famous for his patronage of the arts and founded the , the learned society responsible for matters pertaining to the French language. As an advocate for Samuel de Champlain and New France, he founded (1627) the ; he also negotiated the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye under which Quebec City returned to French rule after English privateers took it in 1629. He was created Duke of Richelieu in 1629.

==Early life==
Born in Paris on 9 September 1585, Armand du Plessis was the fourth of five children and the last of three sons: he was delicate from childhood and suffered frequent bouts of ill-health throughout his life. His family belonged to the lesser nobility of Poitou: his father, François du Plessis, seigneur de Richelieu, was a soldier and courtier who served as the Grand Provost of France, and his mother, Susanne de La Porte, was the daughter of a famous jurist.

When he was five years old, Richelieu&#x27;s father died of fever in the French Wars of Religion, leaving the family in debt; however, with the aid of royal grants, the family was able to avoid financial difficulties. At the age of 9, young Richelieu was sent to the College of Navarre in Paris to study philosophy. Thereafter, he began to train for a military career. There, he learned mathematics, fencing, horse riding, dancing skills, courtly manners, and military drill. His private life seems to have been typical for a young officer of the era; in 1605, aged twenty, he was treated by Théodore de Mayerne for gonorrhea.

Henry III had rewarded Richelieu&#x27;s father for his participation in the Wars of Religion by granting his family the Bishopric of Luçon. The family appropriated most of the revenues of the bishopric for private use; they were, however, challenged by clergymen who desired the funds for ecclesiastical purposes. To protect the important source of revenue, Richelieu&#x27;s mother proposed to make her second son, Alphonse, the bishop of Luçon. Alphonse, who had no desire to become a bishop, became instead a Carthusian monk. Thus, it became necessary that the younger Richelieu join the clergy. He had strong academic interests and threw himself into studying for his new post.

In 1606, Henry IV nominated Richelieu to become Bishop of Luçon. As Richelieu had not yet reached the canonical minimum age, it was necessary that he journey to Rome for a special dispensation from Pope Paul V. This secured, Richelieu was consecrated bishop in April 1607. Soon after he returned to his diocese in 1608, Richelieu was heralded as a reformer. He became the first bishop in France to implement the institutional reforms prescribed by the Council of Trent between 1545 and 1563.

At about this time, Richelieu became a friend of François Leclerc du Tremblay (better known as &quot;&quot;Père Joseph&quot; or &quot;Father Joseph&quot;), a Capuchin friar, who would later become a close confidant. Because of his closeness to Richelieu, and the grey colour of his robes, Father Joseph was also nicknamed &quot;L&#x27;éminence grise&quot; (). Later, Richelieu often used him as an agent during diplomatic negotiations.

==Rise to power==
In 1614, the clergymen of Poitou asked Richelieu to be one of their representatives to the Estates-General. There, he was a vigorous advocate of the Catholic Church, arguing that it should be exempt from taxes and that bishops should have more political power. He was the most prominent clergyman to support the adoption of the decrees of the Council of Trent throughout France; the Third Estate (commoners) was his chief opponent in this endeavour. At the end of the assembly, the First Estate (the clergy) chose him to deliver the address enumerating its petitions and decisions. Soon after the dissolution of the Estates-General, Richelieu entered the service of King Louis XIII&#x27;s wife, Anne of Austria, as her almoner.

Richelieu advanced politically by faithfully serving the queen-mother&#x27;s favourite, Concino Concini, the most powerful minister in the kingdom. In 1616, Richelieu was made Secretary of State, and was given responsibility for foreign affairs. Like Concini, the Bishop was one of the closest advisors of Louis XIII&#x27;s mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici. The queen had become Regent of France when the nine-year-old Louis ascended the throne; although her son reached the legal age of majority in 1614, she remained the effective ruler of the realm. However, her policies, and those of Concini, proved unpopular with many in France. As a result, both Marie and Concini became the targets of intrigues at court; their most powerful enemy was Charles de Luynes. In April 1617, in a plot arranged by Luynes, Louis XIII ordered that Concini be arrested, and killed should he resist; Concini was consequently assassinated, and Marie de Médicis overthrown. His patron having died, Richelieu also lost power; he was dismissed as Secretary of State, and was removed from the court. In 1618, the king, still suspicious of the Bishop of Luçon, banished him to Avignon. There, Richelieu spent most of his time writing; he composed a catechism titled &quot;L&#x27;Instruction du chrétien&quot;.

In 1619, Marie de Médicis escaped from her confinement in the Château de Blois, becoming the titular leader of an aristocratic rebellion. The king and the duc de Luynes recalled Richelieu, believing that he would be able to reason with the queen. Richelieu was successful in this endeavour, mediating between her and her son. Complex negotiations bore fruit when the Treaty of Angoulême was ratified; Marie de Médicis was given complete freedom, but would remain at peace with the king. The queen-mother was restored to the royal council.

After the death of the king&#x27;s favourite, the duc de Luynes, in 1621, Richelieu rose to power quickly. The year after, the king nominated Richelieu for a cardinalate, which Pope Gregory XV accordingly granted in September 1622. Crises in France, including a rebellion of the Huguenots, rendered Richelieu a nearly indispensable advisor to the king. After he was appointed to the royal council of ministers on 29 April 1624, he intrigued against the chief minister Charles, duc de La Vieuville. On 12 August of the same year, La Vieuville was arrested on charges of corruption, and Cardinal Richelieu took his place as the king&#x27;s principal minister the following day, but the Cardinal de la Rochefoucauld nominally remained president of the council (Richelieu was officially appointed president in November 1629).

==Chief minister==
Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s policy involved two primary goals: centralization of power in France and opposition to the Habsburg dynasty (which ruled in both Austria and Spain). He saw the reestablishment of the Catholic orthodoxy as a political maneuver of the Habsburg and Austrian states which was detrimental to the French national interests.

Shortly after he became Louis&#x27; principal minister, he was faced with a crisis in Valtellina, a valley in Lombardy (northern Italy). To counter Spanish designs on the territory, Richelieu supported the Protestant Swiss canton of Grisons, which also claimed the strategically important valley. The cardinal deployed troops to Valtellina, from which the pope&#x27;s garrisons were driven out. Richelieu&#x27;s early decision to support a Protestant canton against the pope was a foretaste of the purely diplomatic power politics he espoused in his foreign policy.

To further consolidate power in France, Richelieu sought to suppress the influence of the feudal nobility. In 1626, he abolished the position of Constable of France and ordered all fortified castles razed, with the exception only of those needed to defend against invaders. Thus he stripped the princes, dukes, and lesser aristocrats of important defences that could have been used against the king&#x27;s armies during rebellions. As a result, Richelieu was hated by most of the nobility.

Another obstacle to the centralization of power was religious division in France. The Huguenots, one of the largest political and religious factions in the country, controlled a significant military force, and were in rebellion. Moreover, Charles I, the king of England, declared war on France in an attempt to aid the Huguenot faction. In 1627, Richelieu ordered the army to besiege the Huguenot stronghold of La Rochelle; the cardinal personally commanded the besieging troops. English troops under the Duke of Buckingham led an expedition to help the citizens of La Rochelle, but failed abysmally. The city, however, remained firm for over a year before capitulating in 1628.

Although the Huguenots suffered a major defeat at La Rochelle, they continued to fight, led by Henri, duc de Rohan. Protestant forces, however, were defeated in 1629; Rohan submitted to the terms of the Peace of Alais. As a result, religious toleration for Protestants, which had first been granted by the Edict of Nantes in 1598, was permitted to continue, but the cardinal abolished their political rights and protections. Rohan was not executed (as were leaders of rebellions later in Richelieu&#x27;s tenure); in fact, he later became a commanding officer in the French army.

Habsburg Spain exploited the French conflict with the Huguenots to extend its influence in northern Italy. It funded the Huguenot rebels to keep the French army occupied, meanwhile expanding its Italian dominions. Richelieu, however, responded aggressively; after La Rochelle capitulated, he personally led the French army to northern Italy to restrain Spain. On 26 November 1629, he was created duc de Richelieu and a Peer of France. In the next year, Richelieu&#x27;s position was seriously threatened by his former patron, Marie de Médicis. Marie believed that the cardinal had robbed her of her political influence; thus, she demanded that her son dismiss the chief minister. Louis XIII was not, at first, averse to such a course of action, as he personally disliked Richelieu. Despite this, the persuasive statesman was able to secure the king as an ally against his own mother. On 11 November 1630, Marie de Médicis and the king&#x27;s brother, Gaston, duc d&#x27;Orléans, secured the king&#x27;s agreement for the dismissal. Richelieu, however, was aware of the plan, and quickly convinced the king to repent.

Meanwhile, Marie de Médicis was exiled to Compiègne. Both Marie and the duc d&#x27;Orléans continued to conspire against Richelieu, but their schemes came to nothing. The nobility also remained powerless. The only important rising was that of Henri, duc de Montmorency in 1632; Richelieu, ruthless in suppressing opposition, ordered the duke&#x27;s execution. In 1634, the cardinal had one of his outspoken critics, Urbain Grandier, burned at the stake in the Loudun affair. These and other harsh measures were orchestrated by Richelieu to intimidate his enemies. He also ensured his political security by establishing a large network of spies in France and in other European countries.

==Thirty Years&#x27; War==
Before Richelieu&#x27;s ascent to power, most of Europe had become enmeshed in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). France was not openly at war with the Habsburgs, who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, so subsidies and aid were provided secretly to their adversaries. Richelieu however, believed that war against Spain would be unavoidable. He considered the Dutch Republic as one of France&#x27;s most important allies, for it bordered directly with the Spanish Netherlands and was right in the middle of the Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain at that time. Luckily for him, Richelieu was a &quot;bon français&quot;, just like the king, who had already decided to subsidize the Dutch to fight against the Spanish via the Treaty of Compiègne in June 1624, prior to Richelieu&#x27;s appointment to First Minister in August. That same year, a military expedition, secretly financed by France and commanded by Marquis de Coeuvres, started an action with the intention of liberating the Valtelline from Spanish occupation. In 1625, Richelieu also sent money to Ernst von Mansfeld, a famous mercenary general operating in Germany in English service. However, in May 1626, when war costs had almost ruined France, king and cardinal made peace with Spain via the Treaty of Monçon. This peace quickly ended after tensions due to the War of the Mantuan Succession.

In 1629, Emperor Ferdinand II subjugated many of his Protestant opponents in Germany. Richelieu, alarmed by Ferdinand&#x27;s growing influence, incited Sweden to intervene, providing money. In the meantime, France and Spain remained hostile due to Spain&#x27;s ambitions in northern Italy. At that time northern Italy was a major strategic region in Europe&#x27;s balance of power, serving as a link between the Habsburgs in the Empire and in Spain. Had the imperial armies dominated this region, France would have been threatened by Habsburg encirclement. Spain was meanwhile seeking papal approval for a universal monarchy. When in 1630 French diplomats in Regensburg agreed to make peace with Spain, Richelieu refused to support them. The agreement would have prohibited French interference in Germany. Therefore, Richelieu advised Louis XIII to refuse to ratify the treaty. In 1631, he allied France to Sweden, which had just invaded the empire, in the Treaty of Bärwalde.

Military expenses placed a considerable strain on royal revenues. In response, Richelieu raised the &quot;gabelle&quot; (salt tax) and the &quot;taille&quot; (land tax). The &quot;taille&quot; was enforced to provide funds to raise armies and wage war. The clergy, nobility, and high bourgeoisie either were exempt or could easily avoid payment, so the burden fell on the poorest segment of the nation. To collect taxes more efficiently, and to keep corruption to a minimum, Richelieu bypassed local tax officials, replacing them with &quot;intendants&quot; (officials in the direct service of the Crown). Richelieu&#x27;s financial scheme, however, caused unrest among the peasants; there were several uprisings in 1636 to 1639. Richelieu crushed the revolts violently, and dealt with the rebels harshly.

Because he openly aligned France with Protestant powers, Richelieu was denounced by many as a traitor to the Roman Catholic Church. (He ordered ships of war from Jean Bicker.) Military action, at first, was disastrous for the French, with many victories going to Spain and the Empire. Neither side, however, could obtain a decisive advantage, and the conflict lingered on after Richelieu&#x27;s death. Richelieu was instrumental in redirecting the Thirty Years&#x27; War from the conflict of Protestantism versus Catholicism to that of nationalism versus Habsburg hegemony. In this conflict France effectively drained the already overstretched resources of the Habsburg empire and drove it inexorably towards bankruptcy. The defeat of Habsburg forces at the Battle of Lens in 1648, coupled with their failure to prevent a French invasion of Catalonia, effectively spelled the end for Habsburg domination of the continent, and for the personal career of Spanish prime minister Olivares.

==New World==
When Richelieu came to power, New France, where the French had a foothold since Jacques Cartier, had no more than 100 permanent European inhabitants. Richelieu encouraged Louis XIII to colonize the Americas by the foundation of the &quot;Compagnie de la Nouvelle France&quot; in imitation of the Dutch West India Company. Unlike the other colonial powers, France encouraged a peaceful coexistence in New France between natives and colonists and sought the integration of Indians into colonial society. Samuel de Champlain, governor of New France at the time of Richelieu, saw intermarriage between French and Indians as a solution to increase population in its colony. Under the guidance of Richelieu, Louis XIII issued the Ordonnance of 1627 by which the Indians, converted to Catholicism, were considered as &quot;natural Frenchmen&quot;:

The 1666 census of New France, conducted some 20 years after the death of Cardinal Richelieu, showed a population of 3,215 &quot;habitants&quot; in New France, many more than there had been only a few decades earlier, but also a great difference in the number of men (2,034) and women (1,181).

==Final years==
Toward the end of his life, Richelieu alienated many people, including Pope Urban VIII. Richelieu was displeased by the pope&#x27;s refusal to name him the papal legate in France; in turn, the pope did not approve of the administration of the French church, or of French foreign policy. However, the conflict was largely resolved when the pope granted a cardinalate to Jules Mazarin, one of Richelieu&#x27;s main political allies, in 1641. Despite troubled relations with the Roman Catholic Church, Richelieu did not support the complete repudiation of papal authority in France, as was advocated by the Gallicanists.

As he neared death, Richelieu faced a plot that threatened to remove him from power. The cardinal had introduced a young man named Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, marquis de Cinq-Mars to Louis XIII&#x27;s court. The cardinal had been a friend of Cinq-Mars&#x27;s father. More importantly, Richelieu hoped that Cinq-Mars would become Louis&#x27;s favourite, so that he could indirectly exercise greater influence over the monarch&#x27;s decisions. Cinq-Mars had become the royal favourite by 1639, but, contrary to Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s belief, he was not easy to control. The young marquis realized that Richelieu would not permit him to gain political power. In 1641, he participated in the comte de Soissons&#x27;s failed conspiracy against Richelieu, but was not discovered. Then, the following year, he schemed with leading nobles (including the king&#x27;s brother, the duc d&#x27;Orléans) to raise a rebellion; he also signed a secret agreement with the king of Spain, who promised to aid the rebels. Richelieu&#x27;s spy service, however, discovered the plot, and the cardinal received a copy of the treaty. Cinq-Mars was promptly arrested and executed; although Louis approved the use of capital punishment, he grew more distant from Richelieu as a result.

However, Richelieu was now dying. For many years he had suffered from recurrent fevers (possibly malaria), strangury, intestinal tuberculosis with fistula, and migraine. Now his right arm was suppurating with tubercular osteitis, and he coughed blood (after his death, his lungs were found to have extensive cavities and caseous necrosis). His doctors continued to bleed him frequently, further weakening him. As he felt his death approaching, he named Mazarin, one of his most faithful followers, to succeed him as chief minister to the king.

Richelieu died on 4 December 1642, aged 57. His body was embalmed and interred at the church of the Sorbonne. By that time, the populace detested him. In many provinces of the kingdom, bonfires were kindled to celebrate his death. During the French Revolution, the corpse was removed from its tomb, and the mummified front of his head, having been removed and replaced during the original embalming process, was stolen. It ended up in the possession of Nicholas Armez of Brittany by 1796, and he occasionally exhibited the well-preserved face. His nephew, Louis-Philippe Armez, inherited it and also occasionally exhibited it and lent it out for study. In 1866, Napoleon III persuaded Armez to return the face to the government for re-interment with the rest of Richelieu&#x27;s body. An investigation of subsidence of the church floor enabled the head to be photographed in 1895.

==Arts and culture==

Richelieu was a chess player and a famous patron of the arts. An author of various religious and political works (most notably his &quot;Political Testament&quot;), he sent his agents abroad in search of books and manuscripts for his unrivaled library, which he specified in his will – leaving it to Armand Jean de Vignerot du Plessis, his great-nephew, fully funded – should serve not merely his family but to be open at fixed hours to scholars. The manuscripts alone numbered some 900, bound as codices in red Morocco with the cardinal&#x27;s arms. The library was transferred to the Sorbonne in 1660. He funded the literary careers of many writers. He was a lover of the theatre, which was not considered a respectable art form during that era; a private theatre, the Grande Salle, was a feature of his Paris residence, the Palais-Cardinal. Among the individuals he patronized was the famous playwright Pierre Corneille. Richelieu was also the founder and patron of the , the pre-eminent French literary society. The institution had previously been in informal existence; in 1635, however, Cardinal Richelieu obtained official letters patent for the body. The includes 40 members, promotes French literature, and remains the official authority on the French language. Richelieu served as the Académie&#x27;s &quot;protector&quot;. Since 1672, that role has been fulfilled by the French head of state.

In 1622, Richelieu was elected the &quot;proviseur&quot; or principal of the Sorbonne. He presided over the renovation of the college&#x27;s buildings and over the construction of its famous chapel, where he is now entombed. As he was Bishop of Luçon, his statue stands outside the Luçon cathedral.

Richelieu oversaw the construction of his own palace in Paris, the Palais-Cardinal. The palace, renamed the Palais-Royal after Richelieu&#x27;s death, now houses the French Constitutional Council, the Ministry of Culture, and the Conseil d&#x27;État. The &quot;Galerie de l&#x27;avant-cour&quot; had ceiling paintings by Philippe de Champaigne, the cardinal&#x27;s chief portraitist, celebrating the major events of the cardinal&#x27;s career; the &quot;Galerie des hommes illustres&quot; had twenty-six historicizing portraits of great men, larger than life, from Abbot Suger to Louis XIII; some were by Simon Vouet, others were careful copies by Philippe de Champaigne from known portraits; with them were busts of Roman emperors. Another series of portraits of authors complemented the library. The architect of the Palais-Cardinal, Jacques Lemercier, also received a commission to build a château and a surrounding town in Indre-et-Loire; the project culminated in the construction of the Château Richelieu and the town of Richelieu. To the château, he added one of the largest art collections in Europe and the largest collection of ancient Roman sculpture in France. The heavily resurfaced and restored &quot;Richelieu Bacchus&quot; continued to be admired by neoclassical artists. Among his 300 paintings by moderns, most notably, he owned Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot;, &quot;The Family of the Virgin&quot; by Andrea del Sarto, the two famous &quot;Bacchanales&quot; of Nicolas Poussin, as well as paintings by Veronese and Titian, and &quot;Diana at the Bath&quot; by Rubens, for which he was so glad to pay the artist&#x27;s heirs 3,000 &quot;écus&quot;, that he made a gift to Rubens&#x27; widow of a diamond-encrusted watch. His marble portrait bust by Bernini was not considered a good likeness and was banished to a passageway.

The fittings of his chapel in the Palais-Cardinal, for which Simon Vouet executed the paintings, were of solid gold – crucifix, chalice, paten, ciborium, candlesticks – set with 180 rubies and 9,000 diamonds. His taste also ran to massive silver, small bronzes and works of &quot;vertu&quot;, enamels and rock crystal mounted in gold, Chinese porcelains, tapestries and Persian carpets, cabinets from Italy, and Antwerp and the heart-shaped diamond bought from Alphonse Lopez that he willed to the king. When the Palais-Cardinal was complete, he donated it to the Crown, in 1636. With the queen in residence, the paintings of the &quot;Grand Cabinet&quot; were transferred to Fontainebleau and replaced by copies, and the interiors were subjected to much rearrangement.

Michelangelo&#x27;s two &quot;Slaves&quot; were among the rich appointments of the château Richelieu, where there were the Nativity triptych by Dürer, and paintings by Mantegna, Lorenzo Costa and Perugino, lifted from the Gonzaga collection at Mantua by French military forces in 1630, as well as numerous antiquities.

==Legacy==

Richelieu&#x27;s tenure was a crucial period of reform for France. Earlier, the nation&#x27;s political structure was largely feudal, with powerful nobles and a wide variety of laws in different regions. Parts of the nobility periodically conspired against the king, raised private armies, and allied themselves with foreign powers. This system gave way to centralized power under Richelieu. Local and even religious interests were subordinated to those of the whole nation, and of the embodiment of the nation – the king. Equally critical for France was Richelieu&#x27;s foreign policy, which helped restrain Habsburg influence in Europe. Richelieu did not survive to the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. However, the conflict ended in 1648, with France emerging in a far better position than any other power, and the Holy Roman Empire entering a period of decline.

Richelieu&#x27;s successes were extremely important to Louis XIII&#x27;s successor, King Louis XIV. He continued Richelieu&#x27;s work of creating an absolute monarchy; in the same vein as the cardinal, he enacted policies that further suppressed the once-mighty aristocracy, and utterly destroyed all remnants of Huguenot political power with the Edict of Fontainebleau. Moreover, Louis took advantage of his nation&#x27;s success during the Thirty Years&#x27; War to establish French hegemony in continental Europe. Thus, Richelieu&#x27;s policies were the requisite prelude to Louis XIV becoming the most powerful monarch, and France the most powerful nation, in all of Europe during the late seventeenth century.Richelieu is also notable for the authoritarian measures he employed to maintain power. He censored the press, established a large network of internal spies, forbade the discussion of political matters in public assemblies such as the Parlement de Paris (a court of justice), and had those who dared to conspire against him prosecuted and executed. The Canadian historian and philosopher John Ralston Saul has referred to Richelieu as the &quot;father of the modern nation-state, modern centralised power [and] the modern secret service.&quot;

His legacy is also important for the world at large; his ideas of a strong nation-state and aggressive foreign policy helped create the modern system of international politics. As a statesman and churchman, Richelieu played an important role in shaping France&#x27;s prominence in the 17th century and influencing the secularization of international policies during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

His pioneering approach to French diplomatic relations using &quot;raison d&#x27;etat&quot; vis-a-vis the power relationship at play were first frowned upon but later emulated by other European nation-states to add to their diplomatic strategic arsenal.

A less renowned aspect of his legacy is his involvement with Samuel de Champlain and the fledgling colony along the St. Lawrence River. The retention and promotion of Canada under Richelieu allowed it – and through the settlement&#x27;s strategic location, the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes gateway into the North American interior – to develop into a French empire in North America, parts of which eventually became modern Canada and Louisiana.

Richelieu is known as the inventor of the table knife. Annoyed by the bad manners that were commonly displayed at the dining table by users of sharp knives (who would often use them to pick their teeth), in 1637 Richelieu ordered that all of the knives on his dining table have their blades dulled and their tips rounded. The design quickly became popular throughout France and later spread to other countries.

==Portrayals in fiction==
As of April 2013, the Internet Movie Database listed 94 films and television programs in which Cardinal Richelieu is a character. Actors who have portrayed Cardinal Richelieu on film and television include Nigel De Brulier, George Arliss, Miles Mander, Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, Aleksandr Trofimov, Tcheky Karyo, Stephen Rea, Tim Curry, Christoph Waltz and Peter Capaldi.

Richelieu is one of the clergymen more frequently portrayed in film, notably as the lead villain in Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and its numerous film adaptations. He is usually portrayed as a sinister character, but the 1950 &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; shows Richelieu (played by Edgar Barrier in a scene not from Rostand&#x27;s original verse drama) as compassionate to Cyrano&#x27;s financial plight, and playfully having enjoyed the duel at the theatre.

Richelieu is indirectly mentioned in a famous line of Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1827–1840), set in 1628, as a Lombard peasant expresses his own conspiracy theories about the bread riots happening in Milan. The 1839 play &quot;Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy&quot; by Edward Bulwer-Lytton portrayed Richelieu uttering the now famous line &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword.&quot; The play was adapted into the 1935 film &quot;Cardinal Richelieu&quot;.

Richelieu and Louis XIII are depicted in Ken Russell&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;The Devils&quot;. The &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; episode &quot;How to Recognise Different Types of Trees from Quite a Long Way Away&quot;, first released in 1969, features the sketch &quot;Court Scene with Cardinal Richelieu&quot;, in which Richelieu (played by Michael Palin) possesses the casual and somewhat smarmy demeanor of a master of ceremonies. Richelieu is a minor and eventually a major character in the &quot;Fortune de France&quot; novel series (published between 1977 and 2003) by Robert Merle. Also, in the 21st century &quot;1632/Ring of Fire&quot; alternative history series by Eric Flint, he is one of the primary antagonists to the nascent United States of Europe.

<doc id="85258" wikidata="Q3328503" url="?curid=85258" title="Music for a Large Ensemble">
<text>Music for a Large Ensemble is a piece of music written by Steve Reich in 1978. It is scored for violin 1, violin 2, cellos, 2 flutes, 2 clarinets, 2 soprano saxophones, 4 trumpets, 4 pianos, 2 marimbas, vibraphone, 2 xylophones and two female voices.

It had its first performance in Utrecht on June 14, 1979. It was a commissioned work by the Holland Festival and it was first performed by Reich&#x27;s musicians as well as members of the Netherlands Wind Ensemble. Reich noted that this piece was developed out of two pieces he had previously written, &quot;Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ&quot; and &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;. The piece was written for more musicians than Reich had previously worked with, and included instruments from all sections of the orchestra, including strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion, and female voices. The piece is divided into four sections, each marked by a key change initiated by the metallophone.

As in some of his other works from the same time, Reich uses the technique of augmentation in this work, whereby short, rapid phrases are stretched out to become longer lines, which combine contrapuntally with other melodies, then using diminution they are returned to their shorter length. Each of the piece&#x27;s four sections develop in an &quot;arch&quot; structure, ABCBA, characteristic of Reich&#x27;s work at this time.

Reich explained that this piece was part of his experiment with using &quot;the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform&quot; (liner notes for Music for a Large Ensemble). Human voices are part of the musical palette in Music for a Large Ensemble, but there are no lyrics.

Although the piece is not one of Reich&#x27;s most popular, it has been recorded several times, most recently in a performance conducted by Alan Pierson. The first recording was a release by ECM Records in 1980 along with &quot;Octet&quot; and a much older piece: &quot;Violin Phase&quot;.

Joan LaBarbara (2005, p. 17) describes the work as &quot;a very colorful work, bright in its opening, a little dark in the second section, brighter again as it moves into the third. The first section&#x27;s timbral blending of women&#x27;s voices with cellos and basses is very effective within the texture. The mallet instruments, clear and solid at the beginning, gradually blend into the background as trumpets and soprano saxophones surge forward. One could watch and feel the rhythmic patterns lock into place as the players relaxed into the performance. It is a bright, joyous, and exciting work&quot;.

<doc id="85259" wikidata="Q3382190" url="?curid=85259" title="Piano Phase">
<text>Piano Phase is a minimalist composition by American composer Steve Reich, written in 1967 for two pianos (or piano and tape). It is one of his first attempts at applying his &quot;phasing&quot; technique, which he had previously used in the tape pieces &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965) and &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966), to live performance.

Reich further developed this technique in pieces like &quot;Violin Phase&quot; (also 1967), &quot;Phase Patterns&quot; (1970), and &quot;Drumming&quot; (1971).

==History==
&quot;Piano Phase&quot; represents Steve Reich&#x27;s first attempt to apply his &quot;phasing&quot; technique. Reich had earlier used tape loops in &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965) and &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966), but wanted to apply the technique to live performance. Reich carried out a hybrid test with &quot;Reed Phase&quot; (1966), combining an instrument (a soprano saxophone) and a magnetic tape.

Not having two pianos at his disposal, Reich experimented by first recording a piano part on tape, and then trying to play mostly in sync with the recording, albeit with slight shifts, or phases, with occasional re-alignments of the twelve successive notes against each other. Reich found the experience satisfying, showing that a musician can phase with concentration.

With the premiere of &quot;Reed Phase&quot; at Fairleigh Dickinson University in early 1967, Reich and a musician friend, Arthur Murphy, had the opportunity to attempt &quot;Piano Phase&quot; with two pianos in live concert. Reich discovered that it was possible to dispense with tape and phase without mechanical assistance. Reich experimented phasing with several versions, including a version for four electric pianos titled &quot;Four Pianos&quot; dating from March 1967, before settling on a final version of the piece written for two pianos. The first performance of the version for four pianos was given on March 17, 1967 at the Park Place Gallery, with Art Murphy, James Tenney, Philip Corner, and Reich himself.
==Composition==

Reich&#x27;s phasing works generally have two identical lines of music, which begin by playing synchronously, but slowly become out of phase with one another when one of them slightly speeds up. In &quot;Piano Phase&quot;, Reich subdivides the work (in 32 measures) into three sections, with each section taking the same basic pattern, played rapidly by both pianists. The music is made up, therefore, of the results of applying the phasing process to the initial twelve-note melody—as such, it is a piece of process music. The composition typically lasts around 15-20 minutes.

===First section===

The section begins by both pianists playing a rapid twelve-note melodic figure over and over again in unison (E4 F4 B4 C5 D5 F4 E4 C5 B4 F4 D5 C5). The pattern consists only of 5 distinct pitch classes.

After a while, one pianist begins to play slightly faster than the other. When this pianist is playing the second note of the figure at the same time the other pianist is playing the first note, the two pianists play at the same tempo again. The process is repeated until the process has gone full circle, and the two pianists are playing in perfect unison.
===Second section===

The second pianist then fades out, leaving the first playing the original twelve-note melody. The first pianist adjusts the bottom part to a four-note motif, which changes the pattern to an 8-note repeating pattern. The second pianist re-enters, but with a distinct 8-note pattern. The phasing process begins again; after the full eight cycles, the first pianist fades out, leaving one eight-note melody playing. The section ends at measure 26.
===Third section===

The last section introduces the simplest pattern, now in 4/8 meter, built from final four notes of the melody from the previous section, and having only four distinct pitch classes. The other pianist re-enters, the phasing process restarts, and ends when both pianists return to unison. The phase cycle is repeated &quot;ad libitum&quot; from eight to sixty times according to the score.
==Analysis==
&quot;Piano Phase&quot; is an example of &quot;music as a gradual process,&quot; as Reich stated in his essay from 1968. In it, Reich described his interest in using processes to generate music, particularly noting how the process is perceived by the listener. (Processes are deterministic: a description of the process can describe an entire whole composition. In other words, once the basic pattern and the phase process have been defined, the music consists itself.)

Reich called the unexpected ways change occurred via the process &quot;by-products&quot;, formed by the superimposition of patterns. The superimpositions form sub-melodies, often spontaneously due to echo, resonance, dynamics, and tempo, and the general perception of the listener.

According to musicologist Keith Potter, &quot;Piano Phase&quot; led to several breakthroughs that would mark Reich&#x27;s future compositions. The first is the discovery of using simple but flexible harmonic material, which produces remarkable musical results when phasing occurs. The use of 12-note or 12-division patterns in &quot;Piano Phase&quot; proved to be successful, and Reich would re-use it in &quot;Clapping Music&quot; and &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;. Another novelty is the appearance of rhythmic ambiguity during phasing of a basic pattern. The rhythmic perception during phasing can vary considerably, from being very simple (in-phase), to complex and intricate.

The first section of &quot;Piano Phase&quot; has been the section studied most by musicologists. A property of the first section of phase cycle is that it is symmetric, which results in identical patterns half-way through the phase cycle.

==Performance==

The piece is played by two pianists without breaks at any stage. A typical performance may last around fifteen to twenty minutes. Reich later adapted the piece for two marimbas, typically played an octave lower than the original.

In dance, the piece was used in 1982 by the Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as part of one of her work &quot;Fase&quot;, which became a cornerstone of contemporary dance.

In 2004, a college student named Rob Kovacs gave the first solo performance of the piece at the Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music. Kovacs played both piano parts at the same time on two different pianos. Reich was in the audience for this world premiere performance. Others, including Peter Aidu, Leszek Możdżer, and Rachel Flowers have also given solo performances of this piece.

On January 28, 2013, the soloists of the Theatre of New Music ensemble Vasily Igonin and Alexey Popov performed this work for the first time in Saratov in the Small Hall of the Conservatory, and on April 25 they repeated the performance of this work at the concert &quot;The Edges of Modernity&quot; in the Great Hall of the Saratov Conservatory.

In 2016, a performance given by harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani at the Kölner Philharmonie was disrupted by audience members who clapped, whistled and shouted &quot;speak German&quot; during the first minutes of the performance, which had to be abandoned.

<doc id="85262" wikidata="Q622319" url="?curid=85262" title="Mysia">
<text>Mysia (UK , US or ; ; ; ) was a region in the northwest of ancient Asia Minor (Anatolia, Asian part of modern Turkey). It was located on the south coast of the Sea of Marmara. It was bounded by Bithynia on the east, Phrygia on the southeast, Lydia on the south, Aeolis on the southwest, Troad on the west, and the Propontis on the north. In ancient times it was inhabited by the Mysians, Phrygians, Aeolian Greeks and other groups.

== Geography ==
The precise limits of Mysia are difficult to assign. The Phrygian frontier was fluctuating, while in the northwest the Troad was only sometimes included in Mysia. The northern portion was known as &quot;Lesser Phrygia&quot; or (; ), while the southern was called &quot;Greater Phrygia&quot; or &quot;Pergamene Phrygia&quot;. Mysia was in later times also known as Hellespontine Phrygia (; ) or &quot;Acquired Phrygia&quot; (; ), so named when the region was annexed to the Attalid kingdom.

Under Augustus, Mysia occupied the whole of the northwest corner of Asia Minor, between the Hellespont and the Propontis to the north, Bithynia and Phrygia to the east, Lydia to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west.

===Land and elevation===
The chief physical features of Mysia are the two mountains—Mount Olympus at (7600 ft) in the north and Mount Temnus in the south, which for some distance separates Mysia from Lydia and afterwards prolonged through Mysia to the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Adramyttium. The major rivers in the northern part of the province are the Macestus and its tributary the Rhyndacus, both of which rise in Phrygia and, after diverging widely through Mysia, unite their waters below the lake of Apolloniatis about from the Propontis. The Caïcus in the south rises in Temnus, and from thence flows westward to the Aegean Sea, passing within a few miles of Pergamon. In the northern portion of the province are two considerable lakes, Artynia or Apolloniatis (Abulliont Geul) and Aphnitis (Maniyas Geul), which discharge their waters into the Macestus from the east and west respectively.

===Cities===
The most important cities were Pergamon in the valley of the Caïcus, and Cyzicus on the Propontis. The whole sea-coast was studded with Greek towns, several of which were places of considerable importance; thus the northern portion included Parium, Lampsacus and Abydos, and the southern Assos, Adramyttium. Further south, on the Eleatic Gulf, were Elaea, Myrina and Cyme.

== History ==

A minor episode in the Trojan War cycle in Greek mythology has the Greek fleet land at Mysia, mistaking it for Troy. Achilles wounds their king, Telephus, after he slays a Greek; Telephus later pleads with Achilles to heal the wound. This coastal region ruled by Telephus is alternatively named &quot;Teuthrania&quot; in Greek mythology, as it was previously ruled by King Teuthras. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer represents the Mysians as allies of Troy, with the Mysian forces led by Ennomus (a prophet) and Chromius, sons of Arsinous. Homeric Mysia appears to have been much smaller in extent than historical Mysia, and did not extend north to the Hellespont or the Propontis. Homer does not mention any cities or landmarks in Mysia, and it is not clear exactly where Homeric Mysia was situated, although it was probably located somewhere between the Troad (to the northwest of Mysia) and Lydia/Maeonia (to its south).

A number of Mysian inscriptions have survived in a dialect of the Phrygian language, written using a variant of the Phrygian alphabet. There are also a small number of references to a Lutescan language indigenous to Mysia in Aeolic Greek sources.

Under the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the northwest corner of Asia Minor, still occupied by Phrygians but mainly by Aeolians, was called &quot;Phrygia Minor&quot; – and by the Greeks &quot;Hellespontos&quot;.

After Rome&#x27;s defeat of Antiochus the Great in the Roman-Syrian War of 192 to 188 BC, the area, which had been held by the Diadoch Seleucid Empire, passed to Rome&#x27;s ally, the Attalid kingdom, and, on the death of King Attalus III in 133 BC, to Rome itself, which made it part of the province of Asia and, later, a separate proconsular Roman province, called &quot;Hellespontus&quot;.

According to the Acts of the Apostles, the apostles Paul, Silas and Timothy came to (or passed by) Mysia during Paul&#x27;s second missionary journey. The narrative suggests that they were uncertain where to travel during this part of the journey, being &quot;forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia&quot;.
Shortly afterwards Paul had a vision of a &quot;man of Macedonia&quot; who invited the apostles to travel westwards to Macedonia.

== Ancient bridges ==
The remains of several Roman bridges can still be found:
*Aesepus Bridge across the Aesepus (today &quot;Gönen Çayı&quot;) 
*Constantine&#x27;s Bridge across the Rhyndacus (&quot;Adırnas Çayı&quot;)
*Makestos Bridge across the Makestos (&quot;Susurluk Çayı&quot;)
*White Bridge across the Granicus (&quot;Biga Çayı&quot;)

<doc id="85264" wikidata="Q124761" url="?curid=85264" title="Epitome">
<text>An epitome (; , from ἐπιτέμνειν &quot;epitemnein&quot; meaning &quot;to cut short&quot;) is a summary or miniature form, or an instance that represents a larger reality, also used as a synonym for embodiment. Epitomacy represents &quot;to the degree of.&quot; An abridgment differs from an epitome in that an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed, as opposed to the epitome, which is an original summation of a work, at least in part.

Many documents from the Ancient Greek and Roman worlds survive now only &quot;in epitome,&quot; referring to the practice of some later authors (epitomators) who wrote distilled versions of larger works now lost. Some writers attempted to convey the stance and spirit of the original, while others added further details or anecdotes regarding the general subject. As with all secondary historical sources, a different bias not present in the original may creep in.

Documents surviving in epitome differ from those surviving only as fragments quoted in later works and those used as unacknowledged sources by later scholars, as they can stand as discrete documents but refracted through the views of another author.

Epitomes of a kind are still produced today when dealing with a corpus of literature, especially classical works often considered dense, unwieldy and unlikely to be read by the average person, to make them more accessible: some are more along the lines of abridgments, such as many which have been written of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, a work of six large volumes (about 3600 pages) often published as one volume of about 1400 pages.

Some are of the same type as the ancient epitome, such as various epitomes of the &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; of Thomas Aquinas, originally written as an introductory textbook in theology and now accessible to very few except for the learned in theology and Aristotelian philosophy, such as &quot;A Summa of the Summa&quot; and &quot;A Shorter Summa&quot;. Many epitomes today are published under the general title &quot;The Companion to ...&quot;, such as &quot;The Oxford Companion to Aristotle&quot;, or &quot;An Overview of ...&quot;, or &quot;guides,&quot; such as &quot;An Overview of the Thought of Immanuel Kant&quot;, &quot;How to Read Hans Urs von Balthasar&quot;, or, in some cases, as an introduction, in the cases of &quot;An Introduction to Søren Kierkegaard&quot; or &quot;A Very Short Introduction to the New Testament&quot; (many philosophical &quot;introductions&quot; and &quot;guides&quot; share the epitomic form, unlike general &quot;introductions&quot; to a field).

==Examples of epitomes for lost works==
* Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius epitomes of Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;
* John Xiphilinus&#x27;s precis of the missing portions of Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot;
* Justin&#x27;s abridged version of the &quot;Philippic History&quot; by Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, one of the main sources for the life of Alexander the Great
* The epitome of Book IV of the Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; [&quot;Library&quot;], a comprehensive encyclopedia of Greek mythology
* &quot;Libro de los Epítomes&quot;, a 2000-page volume summarising the 16th-century collection of Ferdinand Columbus (Hernando Colón) of over books

<doc id="85267" wikidata="Q186264" url="?curid=85267" title="Darius Milhaud">
<text>Darius Milhaud (; 4 September 1892 – 22 June 1974) was a French composer, conductor, and teacher. He was a member of Les Six—also known as &quot;The Group of Six&quot;—and one of the most prolific composers of the 20th century. His compositions are influenced by jazz and Brazilian music and make extensive use of polytonality. Milhaud is considered one of the key modernist composers. A renowned teacher, he taught many future jazz and classical composers, including Burt Bacharach, Dave Brubeck, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis among others.

==Life and career==
Milhaud was born in Marseille, the son of Sophie (Allatini) and Gad Gabriel Milhaud. He grew up in Aix-en-Provence, which he regarded as his true ancestral city. His was a long-established Jewish family of the Comtat Venaissin—a secluded region of Provence—with roots traceable there at least to the 15th century. On his father&#x27;s side, Milhaud&#x27;s Jewish lineage was thus neither Ashkenazi nor Sephardi, but specifically Provençal—dating to Jewish settlement in that part of France as early as the first centuries of the Common Era. Milhaud&#x27;s mother was partly Sephardi on her father&#x27;s side, via a Sephardi family from Italy. 

Milhaud began as a violinist, later turning to composition. He studied at the Paris Conservatory, where he met fellow Les Six members Arthur Honegger and Germaine Tailleferre. He studied composition with Charles Widor and harmony and counterpoint with André Gedalge. He also studied privately with Vincent d&#x27;Indy. From 1917 to 1919, he served as secretary to Paul Claudel, the poet and dramatist who was then the French ambassador to Brazil, and with whom Milhaud collaborated for many years, writing music for many of his poems and plays. In Brazil, they collaborated on the ballet &quot;L&#x27;Homme et son désir&quot;.

On his return to France, Milhaud composed works influenced by Brazilian popular music, including songs by pianist and composer Ernesto Nazareth. &quot;Le Bœuf sur le toit&quot; includes melodies by Nazareth and other popular Brazilian composers, and evokes the sounds of Carnaval. Among the melodies is a Carnaval tune by the name of &quot;The Bull on the Roof&quot; (in Portuguese, which he translated to French &#x27;Le boeuf sur le toit&#x27;, known in English as &#x27;The Ox on the Roof&#x27;). He also produced &quot;Saudades do Brasil&quot;, a suite of 12 dances evoking 12 Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods. Shortly after the original piano version appeared, he orchestrated the suite.

Contemporary European influences were also important. Milhaud dedicated his Fifth String Quartet (1920) to Arnold Schoenberg, and the next year conducted both the French and British premieres of &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; after multiple rehearsals. On a trip to the United States in 1922, Milhaud heard &quot;authentic&quot; jazz for the first time, on the streets of Harlem, which greatly influenced his music. The next year, he completed &quot;La création du monde&quot; (The Creation of the World), using ideas and idioms from jazz, cast as a ballet in six continuous dance scenes.

In 1925, Milhaud married his cousin Madeleine, an actress and reciter. In 1930 she gave birth to a son, the painter and sculptor Daniel Milhaud, who was the couple&#x27;s only child.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of France forced the Milhauds to leave France in 1940. They emigrated to the U.S. (Milhaud&#x27;s Jewish background made it impossible for him to return to France until it was liberated). He secured a teaching post at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he composed the opera &quot;Bolivar&quot; (1943) and collaborated with Henri Temianka and the Paganini Quartet. In an extraordinary concert there in 1949, the Budapest Quartet performed his 14th String Quartet, followed by the Paganini Quartet&#x27;s performance of his 15th; and then both ensembles played the two pieces together as an octet. In 1950, these pieces were performed at the Aspen Music Festival by the Paganini and Juilliard String Quartets.

Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck became one of Milhaud&#x27;s most famous students when Brubeck studied at Mills College in the late 1940s. In a February 2010 interview with JazzWax, Brubeck said he attended Mills, a women&#x27;s college (men were allowed in graduate programs), specifically to study with Milhaud, saying, &quot;Milhaud was an enormously gifted classical composer and teacher who loved jazz and incorporated it into his work. My older brother Howard was his assistant and had taken all of his classes.&quot; Brubeck named his first son Darius.

In 1947 Milhaud was among the founders of the Music Academy of the West summer conservatory, where songwriter Burt Bacharach was among his students. Milhaud told Bacharach, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid of writing something people can remember and whistle. Don&#x27;t ever feel discomfited by a melody.&quot;

From 1947 to 1971, he taught alternate years at Mills and the Paris Conservatoire, until poor health, which caused him to use a wheelchair during his later years (beginning in the 1930s), compelled him to retire. He also taught on the faculty of the Aspen Music Festival and School. As well as Brubeck, his students include William Bolcom, Steve Reich, Katharine Mulky Warne, and Regina Hansen Willman. He died in Geneva at the age of 81, and he was buried in the Saint-Pierre Cemetery in Aix-en-Provence.

==Works==
Darius Milhaud was very prolific and composed for a wide range of genres. His opus list ended at 443.

Milhaud (like such contemporaries as Paul Hindemith, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Henry Cowell, Alan Hovhaness, Bohuslav Martinů, and Heitor Villa-Lobos) worked very rapidly. His most popular works include &quot;Le bœuf sur le toit&quot; (a ballet that lent its name to the legendary cabaret Milhaud and other members of Les Six frequented), &quot;La création du monde&quot; (a ballet for small orchestra with solo saxophone, influenced by jazz), &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (a suite for two pianos, also for alto saxophone or clarinet and orchestra), and &quot;Saudades do Brasil&quot; (a dance suite). His autobiography is titled &quot;Notes sans musique&quot; (&quot;Notes Without Music&quot;), later revised as &quot;Ma vie heureuse&quot; (&quot;My Happy Life&quot;). Please note: &quot;Faire un boeuf&quot; in French translate to &quot;to do a jam session&quot;. During WW1 when assemblies were not allowed, therefore concert hall were closed, many musicians would meet in cafés or such. Some cafés were too small for ensembles and would practice on the roof of the establishment. When Madelaine Milhaud visited Mills College in the early eighties, Emmanuel of Radio à la Carte was able to have a conversation with her about her husband&#x27;s playing before they moved to California for a while. She shared that when people asked where they could hear the new young musicians, they would be told that the &quot;Boeuf est sur le toit&quot;, the jam sessions is taking place on the roof.

==Legacy==
Writing in his &quot;Guide to Twentieth Century Music&quot;, critic Mark Morris described Milhaud&#x27;s work as &quot;one of the unassessed quantities of 20th century music. For as one of its most prolific composers (around 450 works), the quality of his music is so patently uneven that the reputation for the banal and the shallow has masked what is or might be (given the paucity of performances) both inspired and fascinating.&quot; For a composer of acknowledged influence and significance, a number of his pieces lack contemporary professional recordings, such as the second Viola Concerto – a consequence perhaps of his prolific and uneven output.

Lycée intercommunal Darius-Milhaud near Paris is named after him.

<doc id="85272" wikidata="Q168417" url="?curid=85272" title="Hapax legomenon">
<text>In corpus linguistics, a hapax legomenon ( also or ; &quot;hapax legomena&quot;; sometimes abbreviated to hapax, plural &quot;hapaxes&quot;) is a word or an expression that occurs only once within a context: either in the written record of an entire language, in the works of an author, or in a single text. The term is sometimes incorrectly used to describe a word that occurs in just one of an author&#x27;s works but more than once in that particular work. &quot;Hapax legomenon&quot; is a transliteration of Greek , meaning &quot;said once&quot;.

The related terms dis legomenon, tris legomenon, and tetrakis legomenon respectively (, , ) refer to double, triple, or quadruple occurrences, but are far less commonly used.

&quot;Hapax legomena&quot; are quite common, as predicted by Zipf&#x27;s law, which states that the frequency of any word in a corpus is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. For large corpora, about 40% to 60% of the words are &quot;hapax legomena&quot;, and another 10% to 15% are &quot;dis legomena&quot;. Thus, in the Brown Corpus of American English, about half of the 50,000 distinct words are &quot;hapax legomena&quot; within that corpus.

&quot;Hapax legomenon&quot; refers to the appearance of a word or an expression in a body of text, not to either its origin or its prevalence in speech. It thus differs from a nonce word, which may never be recorded, may find currency and may be widely recorded, or may appear several times in the work which coins it, and so on.

==Significance==
&quot;Hapax legomena&quot; in ancient texts are usually difficult to decipher, since it is easier to infer meaning from multiple contexts than from just one. For example, many of the remaining undeciphered Mayan glyphs are &quot;hapax legomena&quot;, and Biblical (particularly Hebrew; see § Hebrew) &quot;hapax legomena&quot; sometimes pose problems in translation. &quot;Hapax legomena&quot; also pose challenges in natural language processing.

Some scholars consider &quot;Hapax legomena&quot; useful in determining the authorship of written works. P. N. Harrison, in &quot;The Problem of the Pastoral Epistles&quot; (1921) made &quot;hapax legomena&quot; popular among Bible scholars, when he argued that there are considerably more of them in the three Pastoral Epistles than in other Pauline Epistles. He argued that the number of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; in a putative author&#x27;s corpus indicates his or her vocabulary and is characteristic of the author as an individual.

Harrison&#x27;s theory has faded in significance due to a number of problems raised by other scholars. For example, in 1896, W. P. Workman found the following numbers of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; in each Pauline Epistle:
At first glance, the last three totals (for the Pastoral Epistles) are not out of line with the others. To take account of the varying length of the epistles, Workman also calculated the average number of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; per page of the Greek text, which ranged from 3.6 to 13, as summarized in the diagram on the right. Although the Pastoral Epistles have more &quot;hapax legomena&quot; per page, Workman found the differences to be moderate in comparison to the variation among other Epistles. This was reinforced when Workman looked at several plays by Shakespeare, which showed similar variations (from 3.4 to 10.4 per page of Irving&#x27;s one-volume edition), as summarized in the second diagram on the right.

Apart from author identity, there are several other factors that can explain the number of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; in a work:
* text length: this directly affects the expected number and percentage of &quot;hapax legomena&quot;; the brevity of the Pastoral Epistles also makes any statistical analysis problematic.
* text topic: if the author writes on different subjects, of course many subject-specific words will occur only in limited contexts.
* text audience: if the author is writing to a peer rather than a student, or their spouse rather than their employer, again quite different vocabulary will appear.
* time: over the course of years, both the language and an author&#x27;s knowledge and use of language will change.

In the particular case of the Pastoral Epistles, all of these variables are quite different from those in the rest of the Pauline corpus, and &quot;hapax legomena&quot; are no longer widely accepted as strong indicators of authorship; those who reject Pauline authorship of the Pastorals rely on other arguments.

There are also subjective questions over whether two forms amount to &quot;the same word&quot;: dog vs. dogs, clue vs. clueless, sign vs. signature; many other gray cases also arise. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; points out that, although there are 1,500 &quot;hapaxes&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, only about 400 are not obviously related to other attested word forms.

A final difficulty with the use of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; for authorship determination is that there is considerable variation among works known to be by a single author, and disparate authors often show similar values. In other words, &quot;hapax legomena&quot; are not a reliable indicator. Authorship studies now usually use a wide range of measures to look for patterns rather than relying upon single measurements.

==Computer science==
In the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), esp. corpus linguistics and machine-learned NLP, it is common to disregard &quot;hapax legomena&quot; (and sometimes other infrequent words), as they are likely to have little value for computational techniques. This disregard has the added benefit of significantly reducing the memory use of an application, since, by Zipf&#x27;s law, many words are hapax legomena.

==Examples==
The following are some examples of &quot;hapax legomena&quot; in languages or corpora.

=== Arabic ===
In the Qurʾān:
* The proper nouns &quot;Iram&quot; (Q 89:7, Iram of the Pillars), &quot;Bābil&quot; (Q 2:102, Babylon), &quot;Bakka(t)&quot; (Q 3:96, Bakkah), &quot;Jibt&quot; (Q 4:51), &quot;Ramaḍān&quot; (Q 2:185, Ramadan), &quot;ar-Rūm&quot; (Q 30:2, Byzantine Empire), &quot;Tasnīm&quot; (Q 83:27), &quot;Qurayš&quot; (Q 106:1, Quraysh), &quot;Majūs&quot; (Q 22:17, Magian/Zoroastrian), &quot;Mārūt&quot; (Q 2:102, Harut and Marut), &quot;Makka(t)&quot; (Q 48:24, Mecca), &quot;Nasr&quot; (Q 71:23), &quot;(Ḏū) an-Nūn&quot; (Q 21:87) and &quot;Hārūt&quot; (Q 2:102, Harut and Marut) occur only once.
* &quot;zanjabīl&quot; ( – ginger) is a Qurʾānic hapax (Q 76:17).
* The epitheton ornans &quot;aṣ-ṣamad&quot; ( – the One besought) is a Qurʾānic hapax (Q 112:2).
* &quot;ṭūd&quot; ( - mountain) is a Qurʾānic hapax (Q 26:63).

===Chinese and Japanese===

Classical Chinese and Japanese literature contains many Chinese characters that feature only once in the corpus, and their meaning and pronunciation has often been lost. Known in Japanese as , literally &quot;lonely characters&quot;, these can be considered a type of &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;. For example, the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; () uses the character exactly once in the verse , and it was only through the discovery of a description by Guo Pu (276–324 AD) that the character could be associated with a specific type of ancient flute.

===English===
It is fairly common for authors to &quot;coin&quot; new words to convey a particular meaning or for the sake of entertainment, without any suggestion that they are &quot;proper&quot; words. For example, P.G. Wodehouse and Lewis Carroll frequently coined novel words. &quot;Indexy&quot;, below, appears to be an example of this.
* &quot;Flother&quot;, as a synonym for snowflake, is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of written English found in a manuscript entitled &quot;The XI Pains of Hell&quot; ().
* &quot;Honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, coming from Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Adagia&quot;
* &quot;Indexy&quot;, in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, used as an adjective to describe a situational state with no other further use in the language: &quot;If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.&quot;
* &quot;Manticratic&quot;, meaning &quot;of the rule by the Prophet&#x27;s family or clan&quot;, was apparently invented by T. E. Lawrence and appears once in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;.
* &quot;Nortelrye&quot;, a word for &quot;education&quot;, occurs only once in Chaucer.
* &quot;Sassigassity&quot;, perhaps with the meaning of &quot;audacity&quot;, occurs only once in Dickens&#x27;s short story &quot;A Christmas Tree&quot;.
* &quot;Slæpwerigne&quot;, &quot;sleep-weary&quot;, occurs exactly once in the Old English corpus, in the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;. There is debate over whether it means &quot;weary with sleep&quot; or &quot;weary for sleep&quot;.

===German===

* The name of the 9th-century poem &quot;Muspilli&quot; is a back-formation from &quot;muspille&quot;, Old High German &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of unclear meaning only found in this text (see for discussion).

===Ancient Greek===
According to classical scholar Clyde Pharr, &quot;the &quot;Iliad&quot; has 1097 &quot;hapax legomena&quot;, while the &quot;Odyssey&quot; has 868&quot;. Others have defined the term differently, however, and count as few as 303 in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and 191 in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.
* &quot;panaōrios&quot; (), ancient Greek for &quot;very untimely&quot;, is one of many words that occur only once in the &quot;Iliad&quot;.
* The Greek New Testament contains 686 local &quot;hapax legomena&quot;, which are sometimes called &quot;New Testament hapaxes&quot;. 62 of these occur in 1 Peter and 54 occur in 2 Peter.
* &quot;Epiousion&quot;, often translated into English as ″daily″ in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Matthew 6:11 and Luke 11:3, occurs nowhere else in all of the known ancient Greek literature.
* The word &quot;aphedrōn&quot; (ἀφεδρών) &quot;latrine&quot; in the Greek New Testament occurs only twice, in Matthew 15:17 and Mark 7:19, but since it is widely considered that the writer of the Gospel of Matthew used the Gospel of Mark as a source, it may be regarded as a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;. It was mistakenly translated as &quot;bowel&quot;, until an inscription from the &quot;Lex de astynomis Pergamenorum&quot; (&quot;Law of the town clerks of Pergamon&quot;) confirmed it meant &quot;latrine&quot;.

===Hebrew===
The number of distinct &quot;hapax legomena&quot; in the Hebrew Bible is 1,480 (out of a total of 8,679 distinct words used). However, due to Hebrew roots, suffixes and prefixes, only 400 are &quot;true&quot; &quot;hapax legomena&quot;. A full list can be seen at the Jewish Encyclopedia entry for &quot;Hapax Legomena&quot;.

Some examples include:
* &quot;Akut&quot; (אקוט – fought), only appears once in the Hebrew Bible, in Psalm 95:10.
* &quot;Atzei Gopher&quot; (עֲצֵי-גֹפֶר – Gopher wood) is mentioned once in the Bible, in Genesis 6:14, in the instruction to make Noah&#x27;s ark &quot;of gopher wood&quot;. Because of its single appearance, its literal meaning is lost. &quot;Gopher&quot; is simply a transliteration, although scholars tentatively suggest that the intended wood is cypress.
* &quot;Gvina&quot; (גבינה – cheese) is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of Biblical Hebrew, found only in Job 10:10. The word has become extremely common in modern Hebrew.
* &quot;Zechuchith&quot; (זכוכית) is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of Biblical Hebrew, found only in Job 28:17. The word derives from the root זכה &quot;z-ch-h&quot;, meaning clear/transparent and refers to glass or crystal. In Modern Hebrew, it is used for &quot;glass&quot;.
* &quot;Lilith&quot; (לילית) occurs once in the Hebrew Bible, in Isaiah 34:14, which describes the desolation of Edom. It is translated several ways. The following verse, Isaiah 34:15, contains another &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;, the word &quot;qippoz&quot; (קִפוֹז), which has been translated as owl, arrow snake, and sand partridge in different versions of the text.

===Hungarian===
* The word &quot;ímés&quot; is mentioned in István Székely&#x27;s 1559 book entitled &quot;Chronica ez vilagnac ieles dolgairol&quot;. According to the theory of literary historian Géza Szentmártoni Szabó, the word means &#x27;half-asleep&#x27;.

===Irish===
* &quot;chomneibi&quot;, an adjective of unknown meaning describing a lath, only appears in &quot;Triads of Ireland&quot; #169.

===Italian===
* &quot;Ramogna&quot; is mentioned only once in Italian literature, specifically in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XI, 25).
* The verb &quot;attuia&quot; appears once in the &quot;Commedia&quot; (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXXIII, 48). The meaning is contested but usually interpreted as &quot;darkens&quot; or &quot;impedes&quot;. Some manuscripts give the alternative hapax &quot;accuia&quot; instead.
* &quot;Trasumanar&quot; is another &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Commedia&quot; (&quot;Paradiso&quot; I, 70, translated as &quot;Passing beyond the human&quot; by Mandelbaum).
* &quot;Ultrafilosofia&quot;, which means &quot;beyond the philosophy&quot; appears in Leopardi&#x27;s &quot;Zibaldone&quot; (Zibaldone 114–115 – June, 7th 1820).

===Latin===
* &quot;Deproeliantis&quot;, a participle of the word &quot;deproelior&quot;, which means &quot;to fight fiercely&quot; or &quot;to struggle violently&quot;, appears only in line 11 of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot; 1.9.
* &quot;Mactatu&quot;, singular ablative of &quot;mactatus&quot;, meaning &quot;because of the killing&quot;. It occurs only in &quot;De rerum natura&quot; by Lucretius.
* &quot;Mnemosynum&quot;, presumably meaning a keepsake or &quot;aide-memoire&quot;, appears only in Poem 12 of Catullus&#x27;s &quot;Carmina&quot;.
* &quot;Scortillum&quot;, a diminutive form meaning &quot;little prostitute&quot;, occurs only in Poem 10 of Catullus&#x27;s Carmina, line 3.
* &quot;Terricrepo&quot;, an adjective apparently referring to a thunderous oratory method, occurs only in Book 8 of Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;.
* &quot;Romanitas&quot;, a noun signifying &quot;Romanism&quot; or &quot;the Roman way&quot; or &quot;the Roman manner&quot;, appears only in Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;de Pallio&quot;.
* &quot;Arepo&quot; is a potential proper name only found in the Sator square. It may be derived by spelling &quot;opera&quot; backwards.
* &quot;Eoigena&quot;, an adjective referred to the sun and signifiyng &quot;one born in the east&quot;, appears only in an epigraph found in Castellammare di Stabia (the ancient Stabiae).

=== Slavic ===
* &quot;Vytol&quot; (вытол) is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; of the known corpus of the Medieval Russian birch bark manuscripts. The word occurs in inscription no. 600 from Novgorod, dated ca. 1220–1240, in the context &quot;[the] &quot;vytol&quot; has been caught&quot; (вытоло изловили, &quot;vytolo izlovili&quot;). According to Andrey Zaliznyak, the word does not occur anywhere else, and its meaning is not known. Various interpretations, such as a personal name or the social status of a person, have been proposed.

=== Spanish ===
* &quot;Atafea&quot; is a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; appearing in a proverb reported by Blasco de Garay in the 16th century (&quot;uno muere de atafea y otro la desea&quot;). The meaning of the word was not known, and was initially interpreted to mean &quot;satiety.&quot; Modern etymologists link it to the north-African Arab term tafaya/attatfíha, which refers to a stew of onion and coriander.
* &quot;Esi&quot;, believed to derive from the Latin conjunction &quot;etsi&quot; &quot;although&quot;, appears only once in Álvaro de Luna&#x27;s &quot;Virtuosas e claras mugeres&quot; (1446).

==In popular culture==
* The avant-garde filmmaker Hollis Frampton made a series of seven films from 1971 to 1972 titled &quot;Hapax Legomena I: Nostalgia&quot; to &quot;Hapax Legomena VII: Special Effects&quot;.
* &quot;Hapax legomenon&quot; as a term became briefly prominent in Britain following the 2014–15 University Challenge Final, after videos went viral of Gonville and Caius student Ted Loveday swiftly giving it as a correct answer when presenter Jeremy Paxman had only managed to ask &quot;Meaning &#x27;said only once&#x27;, what two-word Greek term denotes a word...&quot;.
* The word quizzaciously was cited by Vsauce host Michael Stevens in 2015 as an example of a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;, with Google only returning one search result for the word at the time despite being included in the Oxford English Dictionary. The term briefly became an internet meme and now returns thousands of Google search results.
* In the videogame NetHack, &quot;HAPAX LEGOMENON&quot; is one of the possible randomized texts of a still unidentified type of magic scroll. Once read, the scroll casts its magic effect and then vanishes (&quot;a thing said once&quot;) but possibly becoming henceforth identified (e.g. scroll of enchant armor, scroll of teleportation, etc.) for that playthrough.
* In the webcomic &quot;Narbonic&quot;, a Victorian-era side story introduces a group of Venusian fish-men whose leader is styled The Hapax Legomenon.

<doc id="85276" wikidata="Q202422" url="?curid=85276" title="Salamis Island">
<text>Salamis ( ; ) or Salamina () is the largest Greek island in the Saronic Gulf, about from the coast of Athens&#x27; port of Piraeus and about west of Athens center. 

The chief city, Salamina, lies in the west-facing core of the crescent on Salamis Bay, which opens into the Saronic Gulf. On the eastern side of the island its main port, Paloukia, connects the island with Perama in the western part of Athens urban area through a frequent ferry line and is the second largest port in Greece in terms of passengers, after the port of Piraeus.

==Etymology==
The traditional etymology of Salamis derives it from the eponymous nymph Salamis, the mother of Cychreus, the legendary first king of the island. A more modern theory considers &quot;Salamis&quot; to come from the root &quot;sal&quot; &#x27;salt&#x27; and &quot;-amis&quot; &#x27;middle&#x27;; thus &quot;Salamis&quot; would be the place amid salt water. A theory presented by Martin Bernal in his book Black Athena, which has been overwhelmingly rejected by orientalists, classicists and archaeologists, has attempted to connect the name to the Semitic root Š-L-M &#x27;health, safety, peace&#x27;, because of the well-sheltered harbor.

From at least the 13th century until the 19th century, the town, the island, and the bay of Salamis were called (), because of its round shape (). The ancient name was revived in the 19th century. The name Koulouri is still used informally for the town. The island is known in Arvanitika as (&quot;Kulluri&quot;).

== History ==
Salamis was probably first colonised by Aegina and later occupied by Megara, but became an Athenian possession in the time of Solon or Peisistratos, following the war between Athens and Megara around 600 BC. According to Strabo, the ancient capital was at the south of the island; in classical times it was to the east, on the Kamatero Peninsula overlooking the Strait of Salamis; in modern times it is on the west.

According to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Salamis took part in the Trojan War with twelve ships under the leadership of Ajax ().

Salamis island is known for the Battle of Salamis, the decisive naval victory of the Athenian-led allied Greek fleet, led by Themistocles, over the Persian Empire in 480 BC. It is said to be the birthplace of Ajax and Euripides, the latter&#x27;s birth being popularly placed on the day of the battle. In modern times, it is home to Salamis Naval Base, headquarters for the Hellenic Navy.

Arvanites were recorded among the inhabitants of the island in 1688. They lived in poverty as most of the Arvanites in Greece at the time.

The oldest known counting board was discovered on Salamis Island in 1899. It is thought to have been used by the Babylonians in about 300 BC and is more a gaming board than a calculating device. It is marble, about , and has carved Greek symbols and parallel grooves.

During the German invasion of Greece in World War II, the harbor was bombed by the Luftwaffe on April 23, 1941, sinking the Greek battleships and .

In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military junta period, changes in land legislation allowed the subdivision of land plots. This opened the island to massive unplanned and unregulated urban and suburban development, including many weekend homes, especially along the northern and eastern coasts. The lack of corresponding investment in infrastructure, combined with heavy industry, has led to sea and beach pollution on this side of the island. There are, however, ongoing initiatives such as help from the European Union&#x27;s Cohesion Fund toward improving sewerage by 2008.

An oil spill occurred off the coast of Salamis Island in September 2017.

== Geography ==
Salamina has an area of ; its highest point is Mavrovouni at . A significant part of Salamina is rocky and mountainous. On the southern part of the island a pine forest is located, which is unusual for western Attica. This forest is often a target for fires. 

While the inland inhabitants are mainly employed within the agricultural sector, the majority of Salamis&#x27; inhabitants work in maritime occupations (fishing, ferries, and the island&#x27;s shipyards) or commute to work in Athens. The maritime industry is focused on the north-east coast of the island at the port of (), where ferries to mainland Greece are based, and in the dockyards of Ampelakia and the north side of the Kynosoura peninsula.

Salamina is very popular for holiday and weekend visits from Athens mainland; its population rises to 300,000 in peak season of which c. 31,000 are permanent inhabitants. This supports a strong service industry sector, with many cafes, bars, &quot;ouzeries&quot;, tavernas and consumer goods shops throughout the island. On the south of the island, away from the port, there are a number of less developed areas with good swimming beaches including those of Aianteio, Maroudi, Perani, Peristeria, Kolones, Saterli, Selenia, and Kanakia. However, tourism in the island could develop more. The island is currently partially restricted due to the presence of a naval base, and its proximity to the industrial port at Perama detracts from its appeal.

<doc id="85284" wikidata="Q200031" url="?curid=85284" title="Numa Pompilius">
<text>Numa Pompilius (; 753–672 BC; reigned 715–672 BC) was the legendary second king of Rome, succeeding Romulus after a one-year interregnum. He was of Sabine origin, and many of Rome&#x27;s most important religious and political institutions are attributed to him, such as the Roman calendar, Vestal Virgins, the cult of Mars, the cult of Jupiter, the cult of Romulus, and the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;.

==Genealogy==

According to Plutarch, Numa was the youngest of Pomponius&#x27;s four sons, born on the day of Rome&#x27;s founding (traditionally, 21 April 753 BC). He lived a severe life of discipline and banished all luxury from his home. Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines and a colleague of Romulus, gave in marriage his only daughter, Tatia, to Numa. After 13 years of marriage, Tatia died, precipitating Numa&#x27;s retirement to the countryside. According to Livy, Numa resided at Cures immediately before being elected king.

Titus Livius (Livy) and Plutarch refer to the story that Numa was instructed in philosophy by Pythagoras, but discredit it as chronologically and geographically implausible.

Plutarch reports that some authors credited Pompilius with only a single daughter, Pompilia. Pompilia&#x27;s mother is variously identified as Numa&#x27;s first wife Tatia, or his second wife Lucretia. Pompilia is said to have married the son of the first &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, Numa Marcius, also named Numa Marcius, and by him gave birth to the future king Ancus Marcius.

Other authors, according to Plutarch, additionally gave Numa five sons, Pompo (or Pomponius), Pinus, Calpus, Mamercus, and Numa, from whom the noble families &quot;(gentes)&quot; of the Pomponii, Pinarii, Calpurnii, Aemilii, and Pompilii respectively traced their descent. Other more skeptical authors, still according to Plutarch, believed these were fictional genealogies to enhance the status of these families.

==Kingship==

After the death of Romulus, there was an interregnum of one year, in which members of the Senate exercised the royal power in rotation, each for five days in a row. In 715 BC, after much bickering between the factions of Romulus (the Romans) and Tatius (the Sabines), a compromise was reached, and the Senate elected the Sabine Numa, who was approximately forty years of age, as the next king.

At first, Numa refused the offer of kingship. He argued that Rome, under the influence of Romulus&#x27;s rule, was still a country of war. It needed a ruler who would lead their armies, not someone who lived a life of piety and reflection. However, his father and Sabine kinsmen, including his teacher and the father of Numa&#x27;s son-in-law, Marcus, along with an embassy of two senators from Rome, together persuaded him to accept. In Plutarch and Livy&#x27;s account, Numa, after being summoned by the Senate from Cures, was offered the tokens of power amid an enthusiastic reception by the people of Rome. He requested, however, that an augur should divine the opinion of the gods on the prospect of his kingship before he accepted. Jupiter was consulted, and the omens were favourable. Thus approved by the Roman and Sabine people and the heavens, he took up his position as King of Rome.

According to Plutarch, Numa&#x27;s first act was to disband the personal guard of 300 so-called celeres (the &quot;Swift&quot;) with which Romulus permanently surrounded himself. This gesture is variously interpreted as self-protection in the face of their questionable loyalty, a sign of Numa&#x27;s humility, or a sign of peace and moderation.

Based on Roman chronology, Numa died of old age in 672 BC. After a reign of 43 years, he was about 81 years old. At his request, he was not cremated, but instead buried in a stone coffin on the Janiculum, near the altar of Fons. Tullus Hostilius succeeded him.

Rome had two kings in succession who differed in their methods. According to Livy, Romulus was a king of war while Numa was a king of peace, and thus Rome was well versed in both the arts of war and peace.

==Agent of the gods==

Numa was traditionally celebrated by the Romans for his wisdom and piety. In addition to the endorsement by Jupiter, he is supposed to have had a direct and personal relationship with a number of deities, most famously the nymph Egeria, who, according to legend, taught him to be a wise legislator. According to Livy, Numa claimed that he held nightly consultations with Egeria on the proper manner of instituting sacred rites for the city. Numa then appointed the priests for each of the deities. Plutarch suggests that he played on superstition to give himself an aura of awe and divine allure, in order to cultivate more gentle behaviour among the warlike early Romans: honoring the gods, abiding by law, behaving humanely to enemies, and living proper, respectable lives.

Numa was said to have authored several &quot;sacred books&quot; in which he had written down divine teachings, mostly from Egeria and the Muses. Plutarch (citing Valerius Antias) and Livy record that at his request he was buried along with these &quot;sacred books&quot;, preferring that the rules and rituals they prescribed be preserved in the living memory of the state priests, rather than preserved as relics subject to forgetfulness and disuse. About half of these books—Plutarch and Livy differ on their number—were thought to cover the priesthoods he had established or developed, including the &quot;flamines&quot;, &quot;pontifices&quot;, &quot;Salii&quot;, and &quot;fetiales&quot; and their rituals. The other books dealt with philosophy (&quot;disciplina sapientiae&quot;). According to Plutarch, these books were recovered some four hundred years later (in reality almost five hundred years, i.e. in 181 BC according to Livy ) at the occasion of a natural accident that exposed the tomb. They were examined by the Senate, deemed to be inappropriate for disclosure to the people, and burned. Dionysius of Halicarnassus hints that they were actually kept as a very close secret by the &quot;pontifices&quot;.

Numa is reputed to have constrained the two minor gods Picus and Faunus into delivering some prophecies of things to come.

Numa, supported and prepared by Egeria, reportedly held a battle of wits with Jupiter himself, through an apparition whereby Numa sought to gain a protective ritual against lightning strikes and thunder.

Once, when a plague was ravaging the population, a brass shield fell from the sky and was brought to Numa. He declared that Egeria had told him it was a gift from Jupiter, to be used for Rome&#x27;s protection. He ordered ceremonies to give thanks for the gift, and quickly brought about an end to the plague. The Ancile became a sacred relic of the Romans and was placed in the care of the Salii.

==Rules and institutions attributed to Numa==
Many actions and institutions are attributed to Numa. In some of them, Plutarch thought he detected a Laconian influence, attributing the connection to the Sabine culture of Numa, for &quot;Numa was descended of the Sabines, who declare themselves to be a colony of the Lacedaemonians.&quot;
=== Religious ===
One of Numa&#x27;s first acts was the construction of a temple of Janus as an indicator of peace and war. The temple was constructed at the foot of the Argiletum, a road in the city. After securing peace with Rome&#x27;s neighbours, the doors of the temples were shut and remained so for the duration of Numa&#x27;s reign, a unique case in Roman history.

Another creation attributed to Numa was the cult of Terminus, a god of boundaries. Through this rite, which involved sacrifices at private properties, boundaries and landmarks, Numa reportedly sought to instill in Romans the respect of lawful property and non-violent relationships with neighbours. The cult of Terminus, preached Numa, involved absence of violence and murder. The god was a testament to justice and a keeper of peace. In a somehow comparable, more moral rather than legal fashion, Numa sought to associate himself with one of the roles of Vegoia in the religious system of the neighbouring Etruscans, by deciding to set the official boundaries of the territory of Rome, which Romulus had never wanted, presumably with the same concern of preserving peace.

Recognizing the paramount importance of the &quot;Ancile&quot;, King Numa had eleven matching shields made, so perfect that no one, even Numa, could distinguish the original from the copies. These shields were the &quot;Ancilia&quot;, the sacred shields of Jupiter, which were carried each year in a procession by the Salii priests. Numa also established the office and duties of Pontifex Maximus and instituted (Plutarch&#x27;s version) the flamen of Quirinus, in honour of Romulus, in addition to those of Jupiter and Mars that already existed. Numa also brought the Vestal Virgins to Rome from Alba Longa. Plutarch adds that they were then at the number of two, were later augmented to four by Servius Tullius, and stayed thus through the ages.

Livy and Dionysius give a largely concordant picture of the vast founding work carried out by Numa concerning Roman religion and religious institutions.

Livy begins with the priesthoods which Numa established. Numa created a residentiary flamen to Jupiter endowed with regal insignia, who could carry out the sacred functions of the royal office, which Numa usually discharged: Numa did so to avoid the neglect of the rites whenever the king went to war, for he saw the warlike attitude of the Romans. He also created the flamines of Mars and Quirinus, as well as the Vestal virgins and the twelfth Salii of Mars Gradivus. Then, he chose Numa Marcius as pontiff. To him, he bestowed all the sacred ceremonies, his books and seals. The following words of this passage have been considered a systematic summary exposition of Roman religion:

quibus hostiis, quibus diebus, ad quae templa sacra fierent atque unde in eos sumptus pecunia erogaretur. Cetera quoque omnia publica privataque sacra pontificis scitis subiecit, ut esset quo consultum plebes veniret, ne quid divini iuris negligendo patrios ritus peregrinosque adsciscendo turbaretur. Nec celestes modo caerimonias sed iusta quoque funebria placandosque manes ut idem pontificem edoceret, quaeque prodigia fulminibus a Iove quo visu missa susciperentur atque curarentur.

[translated]...[showing] with what victims, upon what days, and at what temples the sacred rites were to be performed, and from what funds the money was to be taken to defray the expenses. He also placed all other religious institutions, public and private, under the control of the decrees of the pontiff, to the end that there might be some authority to whom the people should come to ask advice, to prevent any confusion in the divine worship being caused by their neglecting the ceremonies of their own country, and adopting foreign ones. He further ordained that the same pontiff should instruct the people not only in the ceremonies connected with the heavenly deities, but also in the due performance of funeral solemnities, and how to appease the shades of the dead; and what prodigies sent by lightning or any other phenomenon were to be attended to and expiated.

Livy lists the &quot;hostiae&quot;, victims, as the first competence of the pontiffs: following this come the days, temples, money, other sacred ceremonies, funerals and prodigies.

Livy continues saying Numa dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius as the source of religious knowledge, and consulted the god by means of auguries as to what should be expiated; he instituted a yearly festival to &quot;Fides&quot; (Faith) and commanded the three major flamines to be carried to her temple in an arched chariot and to perform the service with their hands wrapped up to the fingers, meaning Faith had to be sacred as in men&#x27;s right hand; among many other rites he instituted he dedicated places of the Argei.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus devotes much more space to Numa&#x27;s religious reforms. In his account the institution of eight priesthoods is attributed to Numa: &quot;curiones&quot;, &quot;flamines&quot;, &quot;celeres&quot;, augurs, vestals, &quot;salii&quot;, fetials and pontiffs. He says only a few words about the &quot;curiones&quot;, who were in charge of tending the sacrifices of the &quot;curiae&quot;; the &quot;flamines&quot;; the &quot;tribuni celerum&quot;, who were the bodyguard of the king but who also took part in some religious ceremonies; and the augurs, who were in charge of official divination.

Plutarch records some of these, such as sacrificing an uneven number of victims to the heavenly gods and an even number to the nether gods; the prohibition of making libations to the gods with wine made from the grapes of unpruned vines; the prohibition of sacrificing without flour; the necessity of making a complete turn on oneself while praying and worshiping the gods.

The ritual of the &quot;spolia opima&quot; is ascribed to Numa, too, by ancient sources.

Finally, Arnobius states the indigitamenta were attributed to him.

Numa mostly preferred bloodless and not costly sacrifices.

Plutarch, in like manner, tells of the early religion of the Romans, that it was imageless and spiritual. He says Numa &quot;forbade the Romans to represent the deity in the form either of man or of beast. Nor was there among them formerly any image or statue of the Divine Being; during the first one hundred and seventy years they built temples, indeed, and other sacred domes, but placed in them no figure of any kind; persuaded that it is impious to represent things Divine by what is perishable, and that we can have no conception of God but by the understanding&quot;.

=== Calendar ===
By tradition, Numa promulgated a calendar reform, which divided the year into twelve months according to the lunar course, but adjusted to be in accordance with the solstitial revolution. It was during this time that the months of January and February were introduced. Numa also made the distinction of the days being either profane or sacred.

Plutarch in his Parallel Lives mention that Numa Pompilius made January the first month in the calendar instead of March by the next reason: &quot;he wished in every case that martial influences should yield precedence to civil and political. For this Janus, in remote antiquity, whether he was a demi-god or a king, was a patron of civil and social order, and is said to have lifted human life out of its bestial and savage state. For this reason he is represented with two faces, implying that he brought men&#x27;s lives out of one sort and condition into another.&quot;

=== Social ===
==== Guilds ====
Numa established the traditional occupational guilds of Rome:

So, distinguishing the whole people by the several arts and trades, he formed the companies of musicians, goldsmiths, carpenters, dyers, shoemakers, skinners, braziers, and potters; and all other handicraftsmen he composed and reduced into a single company, appointing every one their proper courts, councils, and observances. (Plutarch)
William Blackstone says that Numa may be credited with &quot;originally inventing&quot; corporations: &quot;They were introduced, as Plutarch says, by Numa; who finding, upon his accession, the city torn to pieces by the two rival factions of Sabines, and Romans, thought it a prudent and politic measure, to subdivide these two into many smaller ones, by instituting separate societies of every manual trade and profession.&quot;

==== Agriculture ====
Numa was credited with dividing the immediate territory of Rome into &quot;pagi&quot; (villages). According to Plutarch, he divided the existing land among indigent people in Rome, and persuaded them to work in agriculture, thinking it would reduce aggressivity, and eliminate poverty and consequently crime. He considered agriculture as an occupation that &quot;fostering character rather than wealth&quot;. Plutarch suggests, the forbidding by Numa of making a sacrifice without a meal and from unpruned vines was intended to make people work in agriculture.

==== Slavery ====
Numa forbade fathers to sell their sons into slavery if the son had married according to the will of the father.

According to Plutarch, Numa permitted slaves to feast with their masters during the Saturnalia, for &quot;admitting to the enjoyment of the yearly fruits of the earth those who had helped to produce them&quot;. Plutarch suggest the timing could be in the memory of &quot;Saturnian age&quot; &quot;when there was neither slave nor master, but all were regarded as kinsmen and equals.&quot;

== Peacemaker ==
Plutarch depicts Numa as a powerful peacemaker. Making the Romans more peaceful was one of his main targets from the beginning of the kingship and many of his actions were directly or indirectly intended to achieve this aim. He succeeded so much that the situation was even better than described in the song:

&quot;And on the iron-bound shield-handles lie the tawneyº spiders&#x27; webs&quot;; &quot;rust now subdues the sharp-pointed spears and two-edged swords; no longer is the blast of brazen trumpets heard, nor are the eyelids robbed of delicious sleep.&quot;

According to Plutarch, any conflicts were excluded not only from Rome but from all Italy. The roads became safe and feasts and festivals prevailed. Nobody tried to hurt Numa, to take his place. When Numa died, from natural causes, people friendly to Rome come from many places to honour him. Plutarch put this in contrast to the policies and the destiny of his predecessors and successors: Romulus who is depicted as war-king and the 5 kings after him, from which 4 were killed and 1 dethroned and expelled from Rome.

==Story of the books of Numa==
Livy narrates that, in 181 BC, while digging in the field of the &quot;scriba&quot; L. Petilius at the foot of the Ianiculum, peasants found two stone coffers, eight feet long and four feet wide, inscribed both in Latin and in Greek characters, one stating that Numa Pompilus, son of Pompon, king of the Romans was buried (there) and the other that Numa&#x27;s books were inside it. When Petilius after the advice of his friends opened it, the one that was inscribed with the name of the king was found empty, the other containing two bundles each of seven books, not complete but looking very recent, seven in Latin dealing with pontifical law and seven in Greek of philosophy as it was in that remote past.

The books were shown to other people and the fact became public. Praetor Q. Petilius, who was friends with L. Petilius, requested them, found them very dangerous to religion and told Lucius he would have them burnt, but he allowed him to try and recover them by legal or other means. The scriba brought the case to the tribunes of the plebs, and the tribunes in turn brought it to the senate. The praetor declared he was ready to swear an oath that it was not a good thing either to read or to store those books, and the senate deliberated that the offer of the oath was sufficient by itself, that the books be burnt on the &quot;Comitium&quot; as soon as possible and that an indemnity fixed by the praetor and the tribunes be paid to the owner. L. Petilius though declined to accept the sum. The books were burnt by the &quot;victimarii&quot;.

The action of the praetor has been seen as politically motivated, and in accord with the Catonian reaction of those years. It is relevant though that some of the annalists of those times or only a few years later, do not seem to show any doubt about the authenticity of the books. The whole incident has been critically analyzed again by philologist E. Peruzzi, who by comparing the different versions, strives to demonstrate the overall authenticity of the books. By contrast, M.J. Pena&#x27;s position is more reserved and critical.

Francophone scholars A. Delatte and J. Carcopino believe the incident to be the result of a real initiative of the pythagoric sect of Rome. The fears of the Roman authorities should be explained in connection to the nature of the doctrines contained in the books, which are supposed to have contained a type of &quot;physikòs lógos&quot;, a partly moral and partly cosmological interpretation of religious beliefs that has been proven by Delatte to be proper of the ancient pythagorism. Part of it must have been in contradiction with the beliefs of fulgural and augural art and of the &quot;procuratio&quot; of the prodigies. Most ancient authors relate the presence of treatises of pythagoric philosophy, but some, as Sempronius Tuditanus, mention only religious decrees.

==Later traditions==
The Christian philosopher Clement of Alexandria in his book Stromata claimed that King Numa Pompilius was influenced by Mosaic law, and due to this refrained from making human images in sculpture. Modern scholars do not accept this claim, as there were no known contacts between the early Kings of Rome and the ancient Hebrews.

Numa Pompilius continued to be remembered well into the later centuries of the Eastern Roman Empire. Composing &quot;Novellae Constitutiones&quot;, 6th-century Emperor Justinian I recalled Numa alongside Romulus as two of the Roman state&#x27;s founders, with Numa being the one who first &quot;organised and enhanced [the city of Rome], by means of laws.&quot; In a similar manner, the Coptic monophysite bishop John of Nikiû likened Empress Theodora, consort of Justinian, to four prominent figures of Roman history (Romulus, Numa, Caesar, Augustus), citing her reforms aimed at eradicating prostitution. In the 11th century, Michael Psellos wrote his &quot;Chronographia&quot; with an intent to provide pedagogical models for his student, Emperor Michael VII Doukas, and when reviewing the seven kings of Rome he lauded Numa as pious, peaceable, and &quot;a man not only well worth seeing for his physical appearance but also equipped with all sorts of mental virtues, and a lover of all wisdom.&quot;

<doc id="85287" wikidata="Q16835368" url="?curid=85287" title="Empanda">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, Empanda or Panda was a goddess, or possibly an epithet of Juno.

Festus identifies her only as a &quot;dea paganorum&quot;, &quot;goddess of the rustics.&quot; Varro associates her with Ceres, and notes that there is a Roman gate named after her, the &quot;Porta Pandana&quot;. A similarly named gate is mentioned in the Umbrian Iguvine Tablets (VIa 14): &quot;pertome Padellar&quot;. Varro connects the word with &quot;pandere&quot;, &quot;to open,&quot; but also explains it by &quot;panem dare&quot;, &quot;to give bread,&quot; so that Empanda would be the goddess of bread or food. 

Modern scholarship associates the Latin Empanda with the Oscan Patanaí (in the dative singular), and the Umbrian &quot;Padellar&quot; (&lt;*&quot;Padenla:s&quot; &lt; *&quot;Patnla:s&quot; &lt; *&quot;Patnola:s&quot;), with Latin &quot;-nd-&quot; regularly from &quot;*-tn-&quot;, and Oscan regular vowel insertion to break up consonant clusters. All are ultimately related to not only &quot;pando/pandere&quot;, but also to Latin &quot;pateo&quot; &quot;I open&quot; and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*peth₂-&quot; &quot;to spread&quot; seen also in English &quot;fathom&quot; (originally meaning &quot;outstretched arms&quot;). 

Empanda had a sanctuary near the gate which led to the capitol and which was called the &quot;Porta Pandana&quot; after her. Her temple was an asylum which was always open. Needy supplicants who came to it were supplied with food from the resources of the temple. In the opinion of Leonhard Schmitz, this custom shows the meaning of the name &quot;Panda&quot; or &quot;Empanda&quot;: it is connected with &quot;pandere&quot;, to open; she is accordingly the goddess who is open to or admits any one who wants protection. Hartung thinks that &quot;Empanda&quot; and &quot;Panda&quot; are only surnames of Juno.

<doc id="85289" wikidata="Q2746488" url="?curid=85289" title="Endovelicus">
<text>Endovelicus (Portuguese: &quot;Endouellicus&quot;, &quot;Endovélico&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Endovélico&quot;, &quot;Enobólico&quot;) is one of the pre-Roman Lusitanian and Celtiberian gods of the Iron Age. He was originally a chthonic god. He was the God/Lord of the Underworld and of health, prophecy and the earth, associated with vegetation and the afterlife. Later accepted by the Romans themselves, who assimilated it to Pluto or to Serapis and made him a relatively popular god.

Endovelicus had a temple in São Miguel da Mota in Alentejo, Portugal, and there are numerous inscriptions and &quot;ex-votos&quot; dedicated to him in the Ethnological Museum of Lisbon; possible toponyms include Andévalo in Spain. The cult of Endovelicus prevailed until the 5th century, just when Christianity was spreading in the region.

==Etymology==
In the last two centuries of scholarship, several etymologies have been proposed to Endovelicus&#x27;s name.

In the 19th century, António da Visitação Freire classified it as a mixed Celtic and Phoenician name, adapted to the Roman language. The &quot;End-&quot; radical would be from Celtic languages; &quot;Bel&quot; (or &quot;Vel-&quot;) would be Phoenician for &#x27;Lord&#x27; and &quot;-Cus&quot; is a usual word termination in Latin. José Leite de Vasconcelos believed the word &quot;Endovellicus&quot; was an originally Celtic title &quot;Andevellicos&quot;, meaning &#x27;very good&#x27;.

An alternate reading derives the word &quot;velicus&quot; from the Celtic &quot;vailos&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot;). Wolves were symbolic animals to the god.

Another, more recently proposed possibility suggests a loanword from proto-Basque, from the &quot;*bels&quot; root. In this case the original name would have been &quot;*Endo-belles&quot;, &quot;most black&quot;, fitting his chthonic characteristics.

== Temples and cult==
There were several places where researchers think his cult could be observed:

In the municipality of Alandroal, there is the &quot;Santuário da Rocha da Mina&quot; (Mina&#x27;s Rock Sanctuary); some authors classify it as a temple of Endovelicus. It is the only known place of this kind in Southern Portugal. Near the temple, we can find the Lucefecit rivulet that has been associated with Lucifer since the Middle Ages. Lucifer was the name used by the Romans for the Morning star and the goddess Venus. Some authors connect the name of the rivulet with the meaning of the place as being the &quot;Glimpse of Light&quot;. A kilometer away, there is a sacred fountain that is said to be more ancient than the temple; its waters are still considered medicinal.

The temple is rocky and hemmed in by a rocky formation that protects the site and the chiselled flooring is often related to Roman sacrificial altars. This sort of monument is not uncommon in the North of Portugal and on the Spanish Meseta.

Leite de Vasconcelos mentions that the site was used by the inhabitants of the Roman Empire from all walks of life. Several inscriptions suggest that the temple of Endovelicus was used as an oracle. One of the inscriptions states: . Leite de Vasconcelos translated this as “&quot;segundo a determinação que emanou de baixo&quot;&quot; (by the determination that emanated from below) suggesting that there is a similarity to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Steam would emanate from below, deep within the earth, and bestow clairvoyance. Vasconcelos also suggests that believers practiced the &quot;incubatio&quot;, sleeping at the site, hoping for dreams they could interpret later.

In Castro of Ulaca in Province of Ávila, a city of the Vettones, a sanctuary dedicated to &quot;Vaelicus&quot; has been discovered. The name could be related to Endovelicus.

The most notable sanctuary hypothetically dedicated to Endovelicus, is the Roman Sanctuary of Panóias in Vila Real, Trás-os-Montes, with a complex system of &quot;sinks&quot; bearing Roman inscriptions. Nearby, in Cabeço de São Miguel da Mota, another temple dedicated to Endovelicus was built and, on its ruins, the Alans built or readapted the previous temple, a sanctuary dedicated to Saint Michael (&quot;São Miguel&quot; in Portuguese). The Muslims transformed the temple into a mosque, and with the Reconquista the temple was once again made a Christian temple. In 1559 the temple was still somewhat well preserved when the Cardinal Henrique ordered 96 marble columns to be removed from the place to build the &quot;Colégio do Espírito Santo&quot; in Évora. From the building only the staging remained. But archaeological forays have turned up pottery and amphorae as well as votive altars dedicated to Endovelicus, and lead to the discovery of several architectural elements, among them the &quot;sinks&quot; made in the rocks. The sinks suggests the existence of rituals, animal sacrifices and, maybe, feasts of a ritual nature.

<doc id="85291" wikidata="Q781780" url="?curid=85291" title="Bonus Eventus">
<text>Bonus Eventus (&quot;Good Outcome&quot;) was a divine personification in ancient Roman religion. The Late Republican scholar Varro lists him as one of the twelve deities who presided over agriculture, paired with Lympha, the goddess who influenced the water supply. The original function of Bonus Eventus may have been agricultural, but during the Imperial era, he represents a more general concept of success and was among the numerous abstractions who appeared as icons on Roman coins.

==Cult and inscriptions==

Bonus Eventus had a temple of unknown date in the Campus Martius. It is mentioned only by Ammianus Marcellinus, in connection to a new portico &quot;(Porticus Boni Eventūs)&quot; built by the urban prefect Claudius in 374 AD. Five Corinthian capitals &quot;of extraordinary size&quot; that were uncovered in the 19th century may have belonged to the portico, which was located in the Gardens of Agrippa.

The epithet &quot;Bonus&quot;, &quot;the Good,&quot; is used with other abstract deities such as &quot;Bona Fortuna&quot; (&quot;Good Fortune&quot;), &quot;Bona Mens&quot; (&quot;Good Thinking&quot; or &quot;Sound Mind&quot;), and &quot;Bona Spes&quot; (&quot;Valid Hope,&quot; perhaps to be translated as &quot;Optimism&quot;), as well as with the mysterious and multivalent Bona Dea, a goddess whose rites were celebrated by women.

Inscriptional evidence for the god is found at several locations, including in the provinces. Senior officials at Sirmium, Pannonia, dedicated a shrine to Bonus Eventus for the wellbeing of high-ranking members of the city council. In Roman Britain, the mosaic floor of a villa at Woodchester bore the reminder &quot;Worship Bonus Eventus duly.&quot; A dedication made by a married couple to Bonus Eventus along with Fortuna indicates that the god&#x27;s sphere of influence had expanded beyond both agriculture and the embodiment of imperial virtues. Images of Bonus Eventus appear regularly on engraved gems, and in a jeweller&#x27;s hoard from Snettisham, Bonus Eventus was the most frequent device on intaglios, appearing on 25 percent of the 127 found. These usages point to a protective or tutelary function for the god, as well as the existence of a religious community to which the jeweller marketed his wares.

==Iconography==
Coins featuring Bonus Eventus were issued during the turmoil of the Year of Four Emperors (69 AD) and the reigns of Galba, Vespasian, Titus, Antoninus Pius, and Septimius Severus. On these coins and on gems, Bonus Eventus is a standing male nude, usually with one leg bent and his head turned away toward a libation bowl in his outstretched hand. Sometimes he is partially clad in a chlamys that covers his back, or in an over-the-shoulder himation with the ends framing his torso. Poppies and stalks of grain are common attributes.
In his book on sculpture, Pliny describes two statues of &quot;Bonus Eventus&quot; which were in fact renamed images of Greek gods. One was a bronze by Euphranor and the other a marble by Praxiteles. The latter stood in the Capitolium with a statue of Bona Fortuna, and the former somewhere between the repurposed Athena below the Capitol and the Leto in the Temple of Concord. It is unclear from Pliny&#x27;s description whether both Greek statues had originally represented the same Greek deity. The classical art historian Adolf Furtwängler conjectured that Praxiteles had depicted an Agathos Daimon, since he was accompanied by a &quot;Bona Fortuna,&quot; presumably a translation of the Greek &quot;Agathē Tychē&quot;. Euphranor&#x27;s bronze is sometimes taken as the type on which the iconography of coins and gems was based, since the figure held poppies and grain. These attributes suggest an Eleusinian deity, and while the Greek original is most often taken as Triptolemus, no extant depictions of Triptolemus show the combination of poppies and grain, which is associated with Demeter (Roman Ceres).

Nero dedicated a temple at Rome to Fecunditas, on occasion of his daughter&#x27;s birth in 63 AD.

<doc id="85295" wikidata="Q10513969" url="?curid=85295" title="Fames">
<text>In Roman mythology, Fames is the personification of hunger, who can arouse an insatiable appetite. She was often said to be one of the several evils who inhabit the entrance to the Underworld. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, she lives in Scythia, a desolate place where she scrabbles unceasingly for the scant vegetation there, and at Ceres&#x27; command, she punishes Erysichthon with a never-ending hunger. Servius calls Fames the greatest of the Furies. She is the equivalent of the Greek Limos.

==Sources==
===Plautus===
In &quot;Stichus&quot; (200 BC), a comedy by the Roman playwright Plautus, the ever-hungry Gelasimus, in the role of the &quot;parasite&quot;, one of the stock characters in Roman comedy, describes Fames as his mother:
===Virgil, Seneca, and Claudian===
The Latin poets Virgil, Seneca the Younger, and Claudian all list Hunger as among the many evils said to dwell in the Underworld. Describing the approach to the Underworld, Virgil, in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, says:

Seneca, in his &quot;Hercules&quot;, says that next to the Underworld river Cocytus lies:
While Claudian lists among &quot;Hell&#x27;s numberless monsters ... Discord, mother of war, imperious Hunger, Age, near neighbour to Death&quot; and several others.

===Ovid===
Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, tells the story of the Thessalian king Erysichthon and his grim fate at the hands of Fames. When Erysichthon cut down a grove of trees sacred to Ceres, the goddess of grain, looked to her antithesis Fames to deliver her punishment: &quot;Let pestilent Hunger torture his body!&quot;

In Ovid&#x27;s account, Fames lives at the farthest edge of Scythia, a frozen, gloomy wasteland, high in the Caucasus Mountains, where little grows. But, Ceres and Hunger being opposites, the Fates never let the two meet. So, in her stead, Ceres sent an oread nymph to seek out Fames:
So the nymph when to Scythia. There she found Fames ceaselessly grubbing (&quot;nail and tooth&quot;) in the ground for whatever little bit of vegetation she could find. She was starving and emaciated:
Fames did as Ceres had commanded. She entered Erysichthon&#x27;s chamber:
Thereafter, Erysichthon is filled with a never ending hunger. He sells all his possessions, including his daughter as a slave, in a futile attempt to satisfy his insatiable appetite. He is ultimately driven to eat his own body.

<text>In Roman mythology, Marica was a nymph, the mother of Latinus. Latinus was fathered by Faunus, who was also occasionally referred to as the son of Marica. The sacred forest near Minturnae was dedicated to Marica. A lake nearby was also named after her. Various Roman authors claims that she was a form of Diana or Venus.

<doc id="85297" wikidata="Q1056381" url="?curid=85297" title="Finnegan's Wake">
<text>&quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; (Roud 1009) is an Irish-American comic folk ballad, first published in New York in 1864. Various 19th-century variety theatre performers, including Dan Bryant of Bryant&#x27;s Minstrels, claimed authorship but a definitive account of the song&#x27;s origin has not been established. An earlier popular song, John Brougham&#x27;s &quot;A Fine Ould Irish Gintleman,&quot; also included a verse in which an apparently dead alcoholic was revived by the power of whiskey.

In more recent times, &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys.

==Summary==
In the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born &quot;with a love for the liquor&quot;, falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan&#x27;s corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan&#x27;s fall and his resurrection—&quot;whiskey&quot; is derived from the Irish phrase &quot;uisce beatha&quot; (), meaning &quot;water of life&quot;.

==Hiberno-English phrases and terms==
*&quot;brogue&quot; (an Irish or Scottish accent)
*&quot;hod&quot; (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)
*&quot;&#x27;s way&quot; (a tippler is a drunkard)
*&quot;&quot; (craythur is colloquially used in Ireland, especially in the North, as referring to someone, or something, for whom one should have sympathy, or to which one should extend some affection. It can also refer to &quot;poteen&quot; (Poitín), &quot;a drop of the craythur&quot; is an expression to have some poteen)
*&quot;Whack fol the dah&quot; (non-lexical vocalsinging called &quot;lilting&quot;; see Scat singing and mouth music. It is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack &#x27;fol the Danaan&#x27;.)
*&quot;trotters&quot; (feet)
*&quot;full&quot; (drunk)
*&quot;&quot; (my darling)
*&quot;hould your &quot; (shut up)
*&quot;belt in the gob&quot; (punch in the mouth)
*&quot;Shillelagh law&quot; (a brawl)
*&quot;&quot; (a fight)
*&quot;&quot; (an expression of shock)

Non-English phrases:
*&quot;Thanam &#x27;on dhoul&quot; (Irish: D&#x27;anam &#x27;on diabhal, &quot;your soul to the devil&quot;) However, in other versions of the song, Tim says &quot;Thunderin&#x27; Jaysus.&quot;

== Use in literature ==

The song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce&#x27;s final work, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the &quot;water of life&quot;, causes both Finnegan&#x27;s death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word &quot;wake&quot; also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep), not to mention the wake of the lifeship traveling in between. Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of &quot;Finnegans&quot;, that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.

&quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Wake&quot; is featured at the climax of the primary storyline in Philip José Farmer&#x27;s award-winning novella, &quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot;.

== Recordings ==
Many bands have performed Finnegan&#x27;s Wake including notably:

*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including &quot;Come Fill Your Glass with Us&quot; (1959), &quot;A Spontaneous Performance Recording&quot; (1961), &quot;Recorded Live in Ireland&quot; (1965), and the 1984 &quot;Reunion&quot; concert at Lincoln Center.
*The Dubliners on several live albums.
*Dropkick Murphys on their albums &quot;Do or Die&quot; and &quot;Live on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day From Boston, MA&quot;.
*The High Kings on their albums &quot;Memory Lane&quot; and &quot;Live in Ireland&quot;

He is the last of the three popes listed in the Annuario Pontificio with the title &quot;the Great&quot;, alongside Leo I and Gregory I. 

Nicholas is remembered as a consolidator of papal authority, exerting decisive influence on the historical development of the papacy and its position among the Christian nations of Western Europe. Nicholas I asserted that the pope should have suzerainty over all Christians, even royalty, in matters of faith and morals.

Nicholas refused King Lothair II of Lotharingia&#x27;s request for an annulment of his marriage to Teutberga. When a council pronounced in favor of annulment, Nicholas I declared the council deposed, its messengers excommunicated, and its decisions invalid. Despite pressure from the Carolingians, who laid siege to Rome, his decision held. During his reign, relations with the Byzantine Empire soured because of his support for Patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople, who had been removed from his post in favor of Photius I.

Since the seventeenth century, Nicholas has been venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, with his feast on 13 November.

His claims of supremacy over territories outside his jurisdiction, the incorporation of the filioque in the Constantinopolitan Nicene creed, and his pressure on Bulgaria to remain under Roman rule, provoked tensions between Rome and Constantinople, leading to his excommunication by the Greeks at the fourth Council of Constantinople.

==Early career==
Born to a distinguished family in Rome, son of the Defensor Theodore, Nicholas received excellent education. Distinguished for his piety, benevolence, competence, knowledge, and eloquence, he entered the service of the Church at an early age. Pope Sergius II (844–847) made him a subdeacon and Pope Leo IV (847–855) a deacon. After the death of Pope Benedict III on 7 April 858, Louis II of Italy came to Rome to influence the papal election. On 24 April Nicholas was elected pope, consecrated, and enthroned in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the presence of Emperor Louis. Three days later, Nicholas held a farewell banquet for the emperor and afterward, accompanied by the Roman nobility, visited him in his camp before the city, on which occasion the emperor met the pope and led his horse for some distance.

==Papacy==

To a spiritually exhausted and politically uncertain Western Europe beset by Muslim and Norse incursions, Pope Nicholas appeared as a conscientious representative of Roman primacy in the Church. He was filled with a high conception of his mission for the vindication of Christian morality and the defence of God&#x27;s law. His co-operation with Emperor Louis II and Byzantine forces temporarily stemmed the Muslim advance in southern Italy. He also strengthened the Ostian fortifications against any future Muslim raids.

===Bishops===
Archbishop John of Ravenna oppressed the inhabitants of the Papal States, treated his suffragan bishops with violence, made unjust demands upon them for money, and illegally imprisoned priests. He also forged documents to support his claims against the Roman See and maltreated the papal legates. As the warnings of the pope were without result, and the archbishop ignored a thrice-repeated summons to appear before the papal tribunal, he was excommunicated. Having first visited the Emperor Louis at Pavia, the archbishop repaired with two imperial delegates to Rome, where Nicholas cited him before the Roman synod assembled in the autumn of 860. Upon this John fled from Rome.

Going in person to Ravenna, the pope then investigated and equitably regulated everything. Again appealing to the emperor, the archbishop was recommended by him to submit to the pope, which he did at the Roman Synod of November 861. Later on, however, he entered into a pact with the excommunicated archbishops of Trier and Cologne, was himself again excommunicated, and once more forced to make his submission to the pope. Another conflict arose between Nicholas and Archbishop Hincmar of Reims: this concerned the prerogatives of the papacy. Bishop Rothad of Soissons had appealed to the pope against the decision of the Synod of Soissons of 861, which had deposed him. Hincmar opposed the appeal to the pope, but eventually had to acknowledge the right of the papacy to take cognizance of important legal causes (&quot;causae majores&quot;) and pass independent judgment upon them. A further dispute broke out between Hincmar and the pope as to the elevation of the cleric Wulfad to the archiepiscopal See of Bourges, but here again, Hincmar finally submitted to the decrees of the Apostolic See, and the Frankish synods passed corresponding ordinances.

===Marriage laws===
Nicholas showed the same zeal in other efforts to maintain ecclesiastical discipline, especially as to the marriage laws. Ingiltrud, wife of Count Boso, had left her husband for a paramour; Nicholas commanded the bishops in the dominions of Charles the Bald to excommunicate her unless she returned to her husband. As she paid no attention to the summons to appear before the Synod of Milan in 860, she was put under the ban.

The pope was also involved in a desperate struggle with the bishops of Lotharingia over the inviolability of marriage. King Lothair II, not having any children by his wife, Teutberga, had abandoned her to marry his mistress, Waldrada. At the Synod of Aachen on 28 April 862, the bishops of Lotharingia approved this union, contrary to ecclesiastical law. At the Council of Metz, June 863, the papal legates, bribed by the king, assented to the Aachen decision, and condemned the absent Teutberga, who took refuge in the court of Lothair&#x27;s uncle, Charles the Bald, and appealed to the Pope. Upon this the pope brought the matter before his own tribunal. The two archbishops, Günther of Cologne and Thietgaud of Trier, both rumoured to be relatives of Waldrada, had come to Rome as delegates, and were summoned before the Lateran Synod of October 863, when the pope condemned and deposed them as well as John of Ravenna and Hagano of Bergamo. Emperor Louis II took up the cause of the deposed bishops, while King Lothair advanced upon Rome with an army and laid siege to the city. The pope took refuge for two days in St. Peter&#x27;s. Subsequently, Engelberga arranged a reconciliation with the pope, the emperor withdrew from Rome and commanded the former archbishops of Trier and Cologne to return to their homes. Nicholas never ceased his efforts to bring about a reconciliation between Lothair and his wife.

Another matrimonial case in which Nicholas interposed was that of Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, who had married Count Baldwin I of Flanders without her father&#x27;s consent. Frankish bishops had excommunicated Judith, and Hincmar of Reims had taken sides against her, but Nicholas urged leniency in order to protect freedom of marriage.

===Relations with the Eastern Church===
In the East, Nicholas was seen as trying to extend his papal power beyond what was canonical authority by asserting a &quot;rulership&quot; over the Church instead of the position of &quot;highest honor among equals&quot; accorded to the pope of Rome by the East. He contended that Patriarch Ignatios of Constantinople was deposed in 858 and Photius I raised to the patriarchal see in violation of ecclesiastical law. Nicholas sent two bishops as papal legates to the Council of Constantinople in 861, but they failed to follow papal instructions. In a letter of 8 May 862 addressed to the patriarchs of the East, Nicholas called upon them and all their bishops to refuse recognition to Photius, and at a Roman synod held in April 863, he excommunicated Photius.

According to the Church of Constantinople, Photius was elected lawfully and canonically by the will of the Byzantine Emperor Michael III in 858. This decision was affirmed later in 879 in a synod of Greek bishops regarded as ecumenical by some in the Orthodox Church. At this synod, Ignatius’ elevation to the patriarchate was declared to be uncanonical and Photius was acclaimed as properly elected as the new patriarch, a decision which ran counter to a previous council held at Constantinople – regarded as ecumenical by the Catholic Church – in which Photius had been deposed and Ignatius reinstated. The Eastern Church resented Nicholas&#x27; pressing of the doctrine of papal primacy. This led to conflict between Constantinople and Rome over doctrinal issues such as the addition of the Filioque clause to the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and territorial claims due to the Church of Constantinople&#x27;s seizure of territory from the Roman Patriarchate in southern Italy, Sicily and Illyricum during the Iconoclast controversy. A synod at Constantinople, headed by Photios, in 867 excommunicated Nicholas and rejected his claims of primacy, his efforts to convert Bulgaria to the obedience of the Roman Church, and the addition of the Filioque clause in parts of the Latin Church. The news of excommunication did not arrive in Rome until after Nicholas&#x27; death.

For a variety of reasons, Prince Boris I of Bulgaria became interested in converting to Christianity and undertook to do that at the hands of western clergymen to be supplied by King Louis the German of East Francia in 863. Late in the same year, the Byzantine Empire invaded Bulgaria as it suffered famine and natural disasters. Boris was forced to sue for peace. Because the majority of his people were still opposed to Christianity, he was secretly baptized according to the Byzantine rite. The Byzantine Emperor who became his godfather conceded territory in Thrace to him.

Unhappy with Byzantine influence and desiring an autocephalous status which Photius was unwilling to grant, Boris sent an embassy to Nicholas with 106 questions on the teaching and discipline of the Church in August 866. Nicholas answered these inquiries in his &quot;Responsa Nicolai ad consulta Bulgarorum&quot; (Giovanni Domenico Mansi, &quot;Coll. Conc.&quot;, XV, 401 sqq.) and sent missionaries under the papal legate bishop Formosus (later Pope Formosus). Also in 866, Nicholas sent a letter to the Bulgarians ordering the burning of any books captured from the Muslims because they were deemed harmful and blasphemous. When Pope Adrian II rejected Boris&#x27;s request that either Formosus or Marinus be made archbishop of Bulgaria, Boris began to look again towards Constantinople. In 870 a council of Constantinople granted the autocephalous status and Greek priests were sent as missionaries; they were soon replaced by Bulgarians.

===Pants controversy===
In 866, the Bulgar Kahn St Boris the Baptiser wrote to Pope Nicholas asking a wide range of questions, one of which being whether or not it was sinful for Christians to wear pants. In response, Nicholas wrote, &quot;For whether you or your women wear or do not wear pants neither impedes your salvation nor leads to any increase of your virtue.&quot; The Pope then proceeded with a discussion on the virtue of wearing the &quot;spiritual pants&quot; of a temperate life while restraining disordered passions.

==Legacy==
Nicholas encouraged the missionary activity of the Church. He sanctioned the union of the sees of Bremen and Hamburg, and confirmed to Archbishop Ansgar of Bremen and his successors the office of papal legate to the Danes, Swedes, and Slavs. In many other ecclesiastical matters, he issued letters and decisions, and he took active measures against bishops who neglected their duties.

In Rome, Nicholas rebuilt and endowed several churches, and constantly sought to encourage religious life. He led a pious personal life guided by a spirit of Christian asceticism. Regino of Prüm reports that Nicholas was highly esteemed by the citizens of Rome and by his contemporaries generally (&quot;Chronicon&quot;, &quot;ad annum 868,&quot; in &quot;Mon. Germ. Hist.&quot; Script.&quot;, I.579). After his death he was regarded as a saint. His cult was re-affirmed in 1630 by Pope Urban VIII. His feast day is observed on 13 November.

A question that is important in judging the integrity of this pope is whether he made use of the forged pseudo-Isidorian papal decretals. After exhaustive investigation, Heinrich Schrörs concluded that the pope was neither acquainted with the pseudo-Isidorian collection in its entire extent, nor did he make use of its individual parts. He perhaps had a general knowledge of the false decretals, but did not base his view of the law upon them and owed his knowledge of them solely to documents that came to him from the Frankish Empire.

Nicholas decreed that the figure of the rooster should be placed on every church. The rooster has served as a religious icon and reminder of Peter&#x27;s denial of Christ since that time, with some churches still having the rooster on the steeple today.

Perhaps the most impactful act of Pope Nicholas was, in the year 866, he ordered that all Christians should abstain from eating the &quot;flesh, blood, or marrow&quot; of warm-blooded animals on Wednesdays and Fridays. This led to the tradition still widely followed by Roman Catholics in the modern day of abstaining from eating meat on Fridays during the liturgical season of Lent, but the meat of cold-blooded animals (such as fish) still being eaten. While there is a theory that this tradition was instituted solely to benefit the fishermen of Europe, there is no evidence for this.

<doc id="85305" wikidata="Q2527609" url="?curid=85305" title="Febris">
<text>Febris (), or Dea Febris (), is the Roman goddess of fevers, who embodied, but also protected people from fever and malaria. Because of this, Febris was a feared goddess whom people wanted the favour of. She does not have a myth of her own nor is she mentioned in a myth. Among her characteristic attributes are &quot;shrewdness&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;, according to Seneca the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;. 

Febris was accompanied by two daughters or sisters of her named Dea Tertiana and Dea Quartana, the goddesses of tertian and quartan fever of malaria because the fever would come back in every three or four days. Theodorus Priscianus mentions Saturn as Tertiana and Quartana&#x27;s father.
The goddess Febris belongs to the apotropaic (turning away) deities (Lat. &quot;Dii averrunci&quot;) who have power over a specific evil: to impose it or to get rid of it. Romans worshipped Febris so she would not do harm to them. She may have originated from the Etruscan-Roman god of purification, Februus. Unlike some Roman deities, Febris was not derived from a Greek deity.

==Name==
&quot;Febris&quot; is the Latin word for fever which the English word &quot;&quot; has originated from. The word &quot;&quot; is from Proto-Italic &quot;*feɣʷris&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*dʰegʷʰris&quot; (which is an extension of the root &quot;*dʰegʷʰ-&quot; meaning “to burn, warm”). Her name is often translated to English as Fever.

Some of Juno&#x27;s epithets are spelt similarly to Febris&#x27; name, such as &quot;Februalis, Februata, Februa&quot; which are also of the same etymological root as &quot;febris&quot;.

==Cult==
Febris had at least three temples in ancient Rome, of which one was located between the Palatine and Velabrum. The second temple was on the Esquiline and the last on the Vicus Longus. Febris&#x27; temples were visited by people with fevers. In those temples, people wore protective amulets against diseases, especially malaria at the time. She was invoked with the formula &quot;Febris diva, Febris sancta, Febris magna&quot; (Divine Fever, Holy Fever, Great Fever). An inscription, which was later revealed to be a possible forgery, saying &quot;Febri Divae, Febri Sanctae, Febri Magnae, Camilla Amata pro filio male affecto&quot; was discovered in Transylvania. 
An inscription dedicated to Quartana in Nemausus, Gaul, dated to the third century (CIL 12.3129) and another inscription dedicated to Tertiana in Habitancum (Risingham), Northern England (CIL 7.999) were discovered.

The Ancient Greeks under Roman rule may have worshipped a similar fever god named Pyretos (Πυρετός, ), the analogous translation of the Roman goddess Febris. Febris might have been worshipped in the Medieval-era Christian Rome disguised under the name &quot;Madonna delle Febbri&quot; (or &quot;della Febbre&quot;) as one of her temples is known to be converted into a church. The cult of Febris could be as old as the Roman civilisation.

==In literature==
===&quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;===
Febris appears with Hercules in the sixth part of &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;. She reveals that Claudius was a &quot;German Gaul&quot; and a liar along with many other things about him when Claudius lied to Jupiter about himself. This made Emperor Claudius angry, Claudius expressed his wrath by shouting unintelligible words that nobody understood, except for the order by a hand gesture for Febris to be beheaded. However, his wish was dismissed.
===Poliziano&#x27;s &quot;In Albieram Albitiam puellam formosissimam morientem&quot; (1473)=== 
Febris was included as a character in the Italian poet Angelo Poliziano&#x27;s Latin work &quot;In Albieram Albitiam puellam formosissimam morientem&quot;. Poliziano&#x27;s Febris is his own fictional depiction rather than an actual mythological depiction. 

Febris appears to a dying young woman named Albiera degli Albizzi. Despite never being physically described previously, Poliziano depicted Febris holding a torch in one hand and a snowball in the other, in a chariot drawn by monster-like lions which was accompanied by a train of monsters. She was described as looking &quot;gruesome&quot;, similar to Erinyes, as opposed to the beauty of Albiera degli Albizzi. She gives a deadly poison to sick Albizzi after saying &quot;those who live sweet, die sweet&quot; and then flies away with the lions.

<text>In ancient Roman culture, felicitas (from the Latin adjective &quot;felix&quot;, &quot;fruitful, blessed, happy, lucky&quot;) is a condition of divinely inspired productivity, blessedness, or happiness. &quot;Felicitas&quot; could encompass both a woman&#x27;s fertility and a general&#x27;s luck or good fortune. The divine personification of Felicitas was cultivated as a goddess. Although &quot;felicitas&quot; may be translated as &quot;good luck,&quot; and the goddess Felicitas shares some characteristics and attributes with Fortuna, the two were distinguished in Roman religion. Fortuna was unpredictable and her effects could be negative, as the existence of an altar to &quot;Mala Fortuna&quot; (&quot;Bad Luck&quot;) acknowledges. Felicitas, however, always had a positive significance. She appears with several epithets that focus on aspects of her divine power.

Felicitas had a temple in Rome as early as the mid-2nd century BC, and during the Republican era was honored at two official festivals of Roman state religion, on July 1 in conjunction with Juno and October 9 as &quot;Fausta Felicitas&quot;. Felicitas continued to play an important role in Imperial cult, and was frequently portrayed on coins as a symbol of the wealth and prosperity of the Roman Empire. Her primary attributes are the caduceus and cornucopia. The English word &quot;felicity&quot; derives from &quot;felicitas.&quot;

==As virtue or quality==

In its religious sense, &quot;felix&quot; means &quot;blessed, under the protection or favour of the gods; happy.&quot; That which is &quot;felix&quot; has achieved the &quot;pax divom,&quot; a state of harmony or peace with the divine world. The word derives from Indo-European &quot;*dhe(i)l,&quot; meaning &quot;happy, fruitful, productive, full of nourishment.&quot; Related Latin words include &quot;femina&quot;, &quot;woman&quot; (a person who provides nourishment or suckles); &quot;felo&quot;, &quot;to suckle&quot; in regard to an infant; &quot;filius&quot;, &quot;son&quot; (a person suckled); and probably &quot;fello, fellare&quot;, &quot;to perform fellatio&quot;, with an originally non-sexual meaning of &quot;to suck&quot;. The continued magical association of sexual potency, increase, and general good fortune in productivity is indicated by the inscription &quot;Hic habitat Felicitas&quot; (&quot;Felicitas dwells here&quot;) on an apotropaic relief of a phallus at a bakery in Pompeii.

In archaic Roman culture, &quot;felicitas&quot; was a quality expressing the close bonds between religion and agriculture. &quot;Felicitas&quot; was at issue when the &quot;suovetaurilia&quot; sacrifice conducted by Cato the Elder as censor in 184 BC was challenged as having been unproductive, perhaps for &quot;vitium&quot;, ritual error. In the following three years Rome had been plagued by a number of ill omens and prodigies &quot;(prodigia)&quot;, such as severe storms, pestilence, and &quot;showers of blood,&quot; which had required a series of expiations &quot;(supplicationes)&quot;. The speech Cato gave to justify himself is known as the &quot;Oratio de lustri sui felicitate&quot;, &quot;Speech on the &quot;Felicitas&quot; of his Lustrum&quot;, and survives only as a possible quotation by a later source. Cato says that a &quot;lustrum&quot; should be found to have produced &quot;felicitas&quot; &quot;if the crops had filled up the storehouses if the vintage had been abundant if the olive oil had flowed deliberately from the groves&quot;, regardless of whatever else might have occurred. The efficacy of a ritual might be thus expressed as its &quot;felicitas.&quot;

The ability to promote &quot;felicitas&quot; became proof of one&#x27;s excellence and divine favor. &quot;Felicitas&quot; was simultaneously a divine gift, a quality that resided within an individual, and a contagious capacity for generating productive conditions outside oneself: it was a form of &quot;charismatic authority&quot;. Cicero lists &quot;felicitas&quot; as one of the four virtues of the exemplary general, along with knowledge of military science &quot;(scientia rei militaris)&quot;, &quot;virtus&quot; (both &quot;valor&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot;), and &quot;auctoritas&quot;, &quot;authority.&quot; &quot;Virtus&quot; was a regular complement to &quot;felicitas&quot;, which was not thought to attach to those who were unworthy. Cicero attributed &quot;felicitas&quot; particularly to Pompeius Magnus (&quot;Pompey the Great&quot;), and distinguished this &quot;felicitas&quot; even from the divine good luck enjoyed by successful generals such as Fabius Maximus, Marcellus, Scipio the Younger and Marius.

The sayings &quot;(sententiae)&quot; of Publilius Syrus are often attached to divine qualities, including Felicitas: &quot;The people&#x27;s Felicitas is powerful when she is merciful&quot; &quot;(potens misericors publica est Felicitas)&quot;.

==Epithets==
Epithets of Felicitas include:
* &quot;Augusta&quot;, the goddess in her association with the emperor and Imperial cult.
* &quot;Fausta&quot; (&quot;Favored, Fortunate&quot;), a state divinity cultivated on October 9 in conjunction with Venus Victrix and the &quot;Genius Populi Romani&quot; (&quot;Genius&quot; of the Roman People, also known as the &quot;Genius Publicus&quot;).
* &quot;Publica&quot;, the &quot;public&quot; Felicitas; that is, the aspect of the divine force that was concerned with the &quot;res publica&quot; or commonwealth, or with the Roman People &quot;(Populus Romanus)&quot;.
* &quot;Temporum&quot;, the Felicitas &quot;of the times&quot;, a title which emphasize the &quot;felicitas&quot; being experienced in current circumstances.

==Republic==
The cult of Felicitas is first recorded in the mid-2nd century BC, when a temple was dedicated to her by Lucius Licinius Lucullus, grandfather of the famous Lucullus, using booty from his military campaigns in Spain in 151–150 BC. Predecessor to a noted connoisseur of art, Lucullus obtained and dedicated several statues looted by Mummius from Greece, including works by Praxiteles: the &quot;Thespiades,&quot; a statue group of the Muses brought from Thespiae, and a Venus. This Temple of Felicitas was among several that had a secondary function as art museums, and was recommended by Cicero along with the Temple of &quot;Fortuna Huiusce Diei&quot; for those who enjoyed viewing art but lacked the means to amass private collections. The temple was located in the Velabrum in the &quot;Vicus Tuscus&quot; of the Campus Martius, along a route associated with triumphs: the axle of Julius Caesar&#x27;s triumphal chariot in 46 BC is supposed to have broken in front of it. The temple was destroyed by a fire during the reign of Claudius, though the Muses were rescued. It was not rebuilt at this site.

Sulla identified himself so closely with the quality of &quot;felicitcas&quot; that he adopted the &quot;agnomen&quot; (nickname) &quot;Felix.&quot; His domination as dictator resulted from civil war and unprecedented military violence within the city of Rome itself, but he legitimated his authority by claiming that the mere fact of his victory was proof he was &quot;felix&quot; and enjoyed the divine favor of the gods. Republican precedent was to regard a victory as belonging to the Roman people as a whole, as represented by the triumphal procession at which the honored general submitted public offerings at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus at the Capitol, and Sulla thus established an important theological element for the later authority of the emperor. Although he established no new temple for Felicitas, he venerated her with a Ludi circenses to close the Sullan Victory games on the Kalends of November, and Ovid writes of a lavish prosperity feast day for Felicitas which he celebrated thereafter.

On July 1 and October 9, Felicitas received a sacrifice &quot;in Capitolio,&quot; on the Capitoline Hill, on the latter date as &quot;Fausta Felicitas&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;Genius Publicus&quot; (&quot;Public Genius&quot;) and Venus Victrix. These observances probably took place at an altar or small shrine &quot;(aedicula)&quot;, not a separate temple precinct. The Acts of the Arval Brothers (1st century AD) prescribe a cow as the sacrifice for Felicitas. Pompey established a shrine for Felicitas at his new theater and temple complex, which used the steps to the Temple of Venus Victrix as seating. Felicitas was cultivated with Honor and Virtue, and she may have shared her shrine there with Victory, as she did in the Imperial era as &quot;Felicitas Caesaris&quot; (Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Felicitas&quot;) at Ameria. Pompey&#x27;s collocation of deities may have been intended to parallel the Capitoline grouping.

A fourth cult site for Felicitas in Rome had been planned by Caesar, and possibly begun before his death. Work on the temple was finished by Lepidus on the site of the Curia Hostilia, which had been restored by Sulla, destroyed by fire in 52 BC, and demolished by Caesar in 44 BC. This temple seems not to have existed by the time of Hadrian. Its site probably lies under the church of Santi Luca e Martina. It has been suggested that an Ionic capital and a tufa wall uncovered at the site are the only known remains of the temple.

&quot;Felicitas&quot; was a watchword used by Julius Caesar&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Thapsus, the names of deities and divine personifications being often recorded for this purpose in the late Republic. &quot;Felicitas Iulia&quot; (&quot;Julian Felicitas&quot;) was the name of a colony in Hispania that was refounded under Caesar and known also as Olisipo, present-day Lisbon, Portugal.

During the Republic, only divine personifications known to have had a temple or public altar were featured on coins, among them Felicitas. On the only extant Republican coin type, Felicitas appears as a bust and wearing a diadem.

==Empire==
A calendar from Cumae records that a &quot;supplicatio&quot; was celebrated on April 16 for the Felicitas of the Empire, in honor of the day Augustus was first acclaimed &quot;imperator&quot;. In extant Roman coinage, Felicitas appears with a caduceus only during the Imperial period. The earliest known example is &quot;Felicitas Publica&quot; on a &quot;dupondius&quot; issued under Galba. &quot;Felicitas Temporum&quot; (&quot;Prosperity of the Times&quot;), reflecting a Golden Age ideology, was among the innovative virtues that began to appear during the reigns of Trajan and Antoninus Pius. Septimius Severus, whose reign followed the exceedingly brief tenure of Pertinax and unsatisfactory conditions under Commodus, used coinage to express his efforts toward restoring the Pax Romana, with themes such as &quot;Felicitas Temporum&quot; and &quot;Felicitas Saeculi,&quot; &quot;Prosperity of the Age&quot; &quot;(saeculum)&quot;, prevalent in the years 200 to 202. Some Imperial coins use these phrases with images of women and children in the emperor&#x27;s family.

When the Empire came under Christian rule, the personified virtues that had been cultivated as deities could be treated as abstract concepts, though the later Empire of Nicaea adopted many Hellenic traditions including a version of the prosperity feast day Felicitanalia allegedly described by Ovid in the missing 11th book of the Fasti (poem). &quot;Felicitas Perpetua Saeculi&quot; (&quot;Perpetual Blessedness of the Age&quot;) appears on a coin issued under Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity.

&quot;Felicitas&quot; was also the basis of the Roman theology of victory adopted during Augustus&#x27; reign. The concept, which constituted the foundation of the imperial Roman propaganda, legitimized power or a claimant&#x27;s right to rule through victory in the absence of traditional institutions. It held that earthly authority depended on heavenly accord and that the successful conquest projected &quot;felicitas&quot; and excessive &quot;virtus&quot; indicating divine sanction of sovereignty and authority.

<doc id="85307" wikidata="Q657093" url="?curid=85307" title="Huey Lewis and the News">
<text>Huey Lewis and the News are an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually achieving 19 top ten singles across the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and Mainstream Rock charts. Their sound draws upon earlier pop, rhythm &amp; blues and doo-wop artists, and their own material has been labeled as blue-eyed soul, new wave, power pop, and roots rock.

The group&#x27;s first two albums were well-received, with Huey Lewis&#x27;s personal charisma as a frontman gaining notice from publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but they struggled to find a wide audience. Their most successful album, &quot;Sports&quot;, was released in 1983. The album, along with its music videos being featured on MTV, catapulted the group to worldwide fame. Their popularity significantly expanded when the song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was featured in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 58th Academy Awards. The group&#x27;s 1986 album, &quot;Fore!&quot;, produced two further number-one singles in &quot;Stuck with You&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. The band&#x27;s other top-ten hits, all from the 1980s, include &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot;, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;If This Is It&quot;, &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot;, &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;, &quot;Doing It All for My Baby&quot; and &quot;Perfect World&quot;.

The group is currently inactive as a performing and recording unit, having halted all touring and recording in 2018 after it was revealed that Lewis had Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner ear disorder. In 2020, they released &quot;Weather&quot;, which contains songs the band recorded prior to Lewis&#x27;s hearing loss.

==History==
===Formation===
In 1972, singer/harmonica player Huey Lewis and keyboardist Sean Hopper joined the Bay Area jazz-funk band Clover. Clover had recorded several albums in the 1970s, and in the middle of the decade transplanted themselves to Britain to become part of the UK pub rock scene.

Without Lewis, they eventually became the backing band for Elvis Costello&#x27;s first album &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;. Lewis also worked with Irish band Thin Lizzy, contributing harmonica to the song &quot;Baby Drives Me Crazy&quot;, recorded onstage for the &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; album. Thin Lizzy bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott introduces Lewis by name during the song. The band returned to the Bay Area by the end of the 1970s.

Clover&#x27;s main competition in the Bay Area jazz-funk scene was a band called Soundhole, whose members included drummer Bill Gibson, saxophonist/rhythm guitarist Johnny Colla, and bassist Mario Cipollina (brother of John Cipollina of Quicksilver Messenger Service). Like Clover, Soundhole had spent time backing singer Van Morrison. After getting a singles contract from Phonogram Records in 1978, Huey Lewis joined Soundhole veterans Hopper, Gibson, Colla, and Cipollina to form a new group, Huey Lewis &amp; The American Express.

Although they played gigs under this name, in 1979, they recorded and released a single simply as &quot;American Express&quot;. The single, &quot;Exodisco&quot; (a disco version of the theme from the film &quot;Exodus&quot;) was largely ignored. The B-side of this record, &quot;Kick Back&quot;, was a song that had previously been performed live by Lewis and his former band, Clover. In 1979, the band was joined by lead guitarist Chris Hayes and moved to Chrysalis Records, which occurred after their demo tape was heard by Pablo Cruise manager Bob Brown, who helped them land a record deal with the label. Chrysalis did not like the name &quot;American Express&quot;, fearing trademark infringement charges from the credit card company, so the band changed its name.

Later in 1980, the band released their first studio album, a self-titled LP, &quot;Huey Lewis and the News&quot;. It went largely unnoticed. In 1982, the band released their second studio album, the self-produced &quot;Picture This&quot;. The album turned gold, fueled by the breakout success of the hit single &quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot;, written by former Clover producer &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Largely because of the single, the album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for 35 weeks and peaked at No. 13. The follow-up singles from &quot;Picture This&quot;, &quot;Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot;, followed, with limited success.

===Mainstream success===
Due to record label delays on the release of their third studio album, &quot;Sports&quot;, Huey Lewis and the News returned in late 1983 to touring small clubs in a bus to promote the record (eventually known as the &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot; tour). The new album initially hit number six in the U.S. when first released. However, &quot;Sports&quot; slowly became a number-one hit in 1984, and went multi-platinum in 1985, thanks to the band&#x27;s frequent touring and a series of videos that received heavy MTV airplay. Four singles from the album reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; reached number eight, while &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;If This Is It&quot; all reached number six. The album has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone.

At the beginning of 1985, the band participated in the all-star USA for Africa charity single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, with Lewis taking a solo vocal. The song topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. They were to play the Philadelphia leg of the Live Aid benefit concert that July, but pulled out two weeks before the concert over concerns that the money raised by the single and other efforts had not been spent to benefit Ethiopian famine victims, earning them vociferous criticism from USA for Africa organizer Harry Belafonte. A year later a &quot;Spin&quot; article suggested that much of the money raised from the single and concert had been misspent.

Their song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was a number-one U.S. hit and featured in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, for which they also recorded the song, &quot;Back in Time&quot;. Lewis has a cameo appearance in the film as a faculty member who rejects Marty McFly&#x27;s band&#x27;s audition for the school&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; contest. As an inside joke, the piece the band plays is an instrumental hard rock version of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Lewis&#x27;s response: &quot;Hold it, fellas ... I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re just too darn loud&quot;). &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award.

Following the success of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Huey Lewis and the News released their fourth studio album, &quot;Fore!&quot;, in 1986. &quot;Fore!&quot; followed the success of &quot;Sports&quot; and reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned the number-one singles, &quot;Stuck with You&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, as well as the mainstream rock hit &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot;. In all, the album had five top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum.

The band continued to tour throughout 1987, and released &quot;Small World&quot; in 1988. After the previous two multi-platinum albums, &quot;Small World&quot; was considered &quot;noticeably weaker&quot;, peaking at number 11 and only going platinum. The album had one top-ten single, &quot;Perfect World&quot;, which reached number three on the pop chart.

At the end of the Small World tour in 1989, the band took a break from recording and heavy touring, and parted ways with Chrysalis Records. In 1991, they released &quot;Hard at Play&quot; on the EMI label in the US and Chrysalis in the UK, which went back to the R&amp;B/rock sound of their earlier albums, and released the hit singles &quot;Couple Days Off&quot; (number 11) and &quot;It Hit Me Like a Hammer&quot; (number 21).

The band once again changed labels, this time signing with Elektra Records, releasing a cover album in 1994 called &quot;Four Chords &amp; Several Years Ago&quot;, featuring doo-wop and rock songs from the 1950s and 1960s. The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and had two hits on adult contemporary radio.

In early 1996, the band released the greatest hits album &quot;Time Flies&quot; which focused primarily on the releases from &quot;Picture This&quot;, &quot;Sports&quot;, and &quot;Fore!&quot;, and included four new tracks.

===The 21st century===
The band&#x27;s lineup has changed moderately since its heyday. Bassist Mario Cipollina left the band in 1995, and was replaced by John Pierce. Tower of Power, which often served as the band&#x27;s touring horn section in the 1980s, ceased their work with the band in 1994. Horn players Marvin McFadden, Ron Stallings and Rob Sudduth joined the group in their place as &quot;The Sports Section&quot;. In 2001, Chris Hayes retired to spend more time with his family after performing on the album &quot;Plan B&quot;. Guitarists Stef Burns became Hayes&#x27;s successor, while James Harrah filled in for Burns occasionally. On April 13, 2009, touring saxophonist Ron Stallings died from multiple myeloma.

In 2001, the News released their first album in seven years, &quot;Plan B&quot;, on Jive Records. It only briefly made the charts, with the lead single, &quot;Let Her Go &amp; Start Over&quot;, becoming a minor adult contemporary hit. In December 2004, Huey Lewis and the News recorded their first live album, &quot;Live at 25&quot;, at the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in Chico, California, commemorating the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. In 2008, they recorded the theme song to the action-comedy film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; at the request of Seth Rogen. The song is played over the end credits of the film and appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album.

The band returned to the studio in 2010, recording their first album in nearly a decade. The album, entitled &quot;Soulsville&quot;, is a Stax Records tribute album recorded at the legendary Ardent Studios. They continued to tour regularly, playing around 70 dates a year, until 2018, when the band halted all touring after it was revealed that Lewis had Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner ear disorder. In January 2019, Huey Lewis and the News signed with BMG Rights Management. On February 14, 2020, as Harrah became an official member, they released &quot;Weather&quot; (their first studio album of new songs since &quot;Plan B&quot;), which contains songs the band recorded prior to Lewis&#x27;s hearing loss.

On November 1, 2023, a new musical comedy inspired by the hits of Huey Lewis and the News was announced, &quot;The Heart of Rock and Roll&quot;. A romantic comedy, it contains a number of the band&#x27;s hits like &quot;Workin&#x27; for a Livin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Stuck with You&quot; and &quot;If This is It&quot;.

==&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; song lawsuit==
In 1984, Ray Parker Jr. was signed by the producers of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; to develop the film&#x27;s title song. Later that year, Huey Lewis and the News sued Parker, citing the similarities between the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; song and their earlier hit &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;. According to Huey Lewis and the News, this was especially damaging to them since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was so popular (it rose to number one on the charts for three weeks). The dispute was ultimately settled out of court. Lewis has stated that his experiences with the producers of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; were indirectly responsible for him getting involved in the movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985).

Parker later filed a suit against Lewis, claiming violation of the agreement to not discuss the settlement publicly.Lewis broke his silence by dissing Parker in an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, [in 2001] which prompted Parker to slap him with a lawsuit. &quot;The offensive part was not so much that Ray Parker Jr. had ripped this song off,&quot; says Lewis, who goes on to blame the arrogance of music industry execs who thought they could simply pay him off for stealing his melody. &quot;In the end, I suppose they were right. I suppose it was for sale, because, basically, they bought it.&quot;&quot;Premiere&quot; magazine in 2004 featured an anniversary article about the movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; in which the filmmakers at Columbia Pictures admitted to using the song &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; as temporary background music in many scenes. They also noted that they had offered to hire Huey Lewis and the News to write the main theme but the band had declined. Lewis, in the 2001 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special, said the band had declined the filmmakers&#x27; offer because an upcoming concert tour to promote their hugely successful &quot;Sports&quot; album left no time to write a main theme for a movie. The filmmakers then gave film footage – with the Huey Lewis song in the background – to Ray Parker Jr., to aid Parker in writing the theme song.

==&quot;American Psycho&quot; soundtrack==
The band is mentioned numerous times in Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;American Psycho&quot;, and its subsequent film adaptation. The chapter in the novel is entitled &quot;Huey Lewis &amp; the News&quot;, and consists of an extended essay about the band&#x27;s recorded output and career. During the scene in the film where the main protagonist, Patrick Bateman, kills his colleague, Paul Allen, with an axe, Bateman plays the song &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; and waxes lyrical about the band:

:&quot;Do you like Huey Lewis &amp; The News? Their early work was a little too &#x27;new-wave&#x27; for my taste, but when &#x27;Sports&#x27; came out in &#x27;83, I think they really came into their own – both commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He&#x27;s been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In &#x27;87, Huey released this, &#x27;Fore&#x27;, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is &#x27;Hip to Be Square&#x27;, a song so catchy most people probably don&#x27;t listen to the lyrics – but they should! Because it&#x27;s not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it&#x27;s also a personal statement about the band itself!&quot;

&quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; was initially intended to be on the soundtrack album, but was removed from the album due to lack of publishing rights. As a result, Koch Records were forced to recall and destroy approximately 100,000 copies of the album. Koch Records president Bob Frank said, &quot;As a result of the violent nature of the film, Huey Lewis&#x27;s management decided not to give the soundtrack clearance.&quot; Lewis&#x27;s manager Bob Brown claimed that the musician had not seen the film and that &quot;we knew nothing about a soundtrack album. They just went ahead and put the cut on there. I think what they&#x27;re trying to do is drum up publicity for themselves.&quot;

In April 2013, to mark the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Sports&quot;, comedy video website Funny or Die created a parody of the axe murder scene featuring Huey Lewis as Patrick Bateman and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic (who parodied &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; as &quot;I Want a New Duck&quot; years before) as Paul Allen.

<text>Ferentina was the patron goddess of the city Ferentinum, Latium. She was protector of the Latin commonwealth. She was also closely associated with the Roman Empire.

A grove sacred to the goddess was used as the site of a famous meeting of the leaders of the Latin towns with the last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, at the beginning of his reign. The leading citizen of Aricia, Turnus Herdonius was murdered at the command of Tarquinius, by being drowned in the sacred waters of the grove.

The sacred grove also features in the history of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus. In 491 BC, the Volscian leader Attius Tullus Aufidius sought to stir up trouble in Rome by contriving for the Roman senate to expel the Volsci from the city during the Great Games. Attius met the fleeing Volsci at Ferentina&#x27;s grove, and spoke to them, stirring up their feelings against Rome. Attius&#x27; actions led to a war between Rome and the Volsci.

<text>Fides () was the goddess of trust, faithfulness, and good faith (&quot;bona fides&quot;) in ancient Roman religion. Fides was one of the original virtues to be cultivated as a divinity with ceremonies and temples.
Fides embodies everything that is required for &quot;honour and credibility, from fidelity in marriage, to contractual arrangements, and the obligation soldiers owed to Rome.&quot; Fides also means reliability, &quot;reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal.&quot; and &quot;bedrock of relations between people and their communities&quot;, and then it was turned into a Roman deity and from which we gain the English word, &#x27;fidelity&#x27;. 

Under the name &quot;Fides Publica Populi Romani&quot; (&quot;Public Trust of the Roman People&quot;), she may be exemplified in Marcus Atilius Regulus, &quot;who refuses to save himself at the expense of the Republic. Regulus defied his own best interests for those of his country. In this act alone, he acted with fides.&quot;

==Iconography==
Fides is represented as a young woman crowned with an olive or laurel wreath, holding in her hand a turtle-dove, fruits or grain, or a military ensign. She wears a white veil.
==Temple and ceremonies==
The Temple of Fides on the Capitoline Hill was associated with the &quot;Fides Publica&quot; or &quot;Fides Publica Populi Romani&quot;. Dedicated by Aulus Atilius Calatinus, and restored by Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, the structure was surrounded by a display of bronze tables of laws and treaties, and was occasionally used for Senate meetings.

According to tradition, Rome&#x27;s second king, Numa Pompilius, instituted a yearly ceremony on 1 October devoted to Fides Publica, in which the three &quot;flamines maiores&quot; (major priests)—the Dialis, Martialis, and Quirinalis—were to be borne to her temple in a covered arched chariot drawn by two horses. There they should conduct her services with their heads covered and right hands wrapped up to the fingers to indicate absolute devotion to her and to symbolise trust.
