<text>Lawrenceville is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) within Lawrence Township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The community is situated roughly halfway between Princeton and Trenton. Lawrenceville is part of the Trenton–Princeton metropolitan area within the New York combined statistical area; however, the CDP actually is located approximately 15 miles closer to Philadelphia than to New York City, and as with the remainder of Mercer County, lies within the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Philadelphia Designated Market Area. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 3,751, a decrease of 136 (−3.5%) from the 3,887 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected a decrease of 194 (−4.8%) from the 4,081 counted in the 2000 census.

Lawrenceville is also known as the &quot;village of Lawrenceville&quot;. Its core is the Main Street Historic District, which was listed both in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was one of the first registered historic districts in New Jersey.

== History ==

Lawrenceville was founded as Maidenhead in 1697, as part of Burlington County in the colony of West Jersey. In 1714, the village became a part of Hunterdon County. In 1798, the New Jersey Legislature legally incorporated the Township of Maidenhead.

The village was originally named for Maidenhead, a historic English town on the Thames River, about 30 miles west from London. The Colonial Supreme Court at Burlington officially confirmed the name on February 20, 1697. &quot;Maidenhead&quot; derives from the Anglo Saxon word &quot;Maidenhythe,&quot; meaning &quot;new wharf&quot;, though it acquired a secondary meaning as a term for virginity.

The Rev. Issac V. Brown, the first full-time pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville and the founder of the Academy of Maidenhead (now the Lawrenceville School), led a movement to petition the Legislature to change the town&#x27;s name. The petition said &quot;... it must be the wish of every good citizen... to be relieved of the necessity of using a term which may offend the delicacy of modesty, or disturb the feelings of seriousness, or excite the sneers of the willing.&quot;

The Legislature officially changed the name from Maidenhead to Lawrence on January 24, 1816, at a meeting in John Moore&#x27;s Tavern. The township took its name from Captain James Lawrence, a naval hero of the War of 1812. The village was renamed Lawrenceville at the same time. In 1838, Mercer County was formed from parts of three counties, and Lawrence Township was included in the new county. The township&#x27;s boundaries and geographic relationships have remained the same since that time.

During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington&#x27;s troops marched through Maidenhead after the Battle of Trenton (December 26, 1776) and the Battle of the Assunpink Creek (January 2, 1777), chasing British troops. They met at the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777, just over the township line, where the Princeton Battlefield State Park now stands.

Cornwallis stayed overnight in Maidenhead on December 8, 1776, en route to Trenton. He recorded the moment in his diary, a portion of which was found years later in John Moore&#x27;s Tavern, which is now a residential house at 2695 Main Street. His opinion of the village was that &quot;one night in Maidenhead was more than enough&quot;.

When the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville was built in 1698, it was called the Meetinghouse of Maidenhead. It is still serving the community at 2688 Main Street.

==Geography==

Lawrenceville is in central Mercer County, northeast of Trenton and southwest of Princeton. U.S. Route 206 changes its name from &quot;Lawrenceville-Princeton Road&quot; to &quot;Main Street&quot;, and then to &quot;Lawrenceville-Trenton Road&quot; in the center of Lawrenceville. The local historic district fronts along Main Street and US 206 stretch for more than two miles between Franklin Corner Road and an area slightly north of Fackler Road. Homes situated more than 250 feet from the road are excluded, however. One exception is the section of the Lawrenceville School known as the Circle and several other buildings in its vicinity, the oldest buildings on the campus. This area itself has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

Lawrenceville generally comprises the area contained within Lawrenceville-Pennington Road to the southwest, Fackler Road to the northeast, Keefe Road to the northwest, and US 206 to the southeast, part of which turns into Main Street in Lawrenceville, to the east. The Lawrenceville School, across Route 206, is usually considered part of the village as well. Before tract development, beginning in the early 1970s, Lawrenceville was broadly defined as stretching two to three blocks back from Route 206. The boundary became less clear as residential developments replaced farmland behind the historic village. The boundary of the Lawrenceville census-designated place, used for all population statistics, follows the roads listed above, except that the northeast boundary is at Cold Soil Road rather than Fackler Road.

Lawrence Township is occasionally and mistakenly referred to as Lawrenceville. The confusion is partly caused because the local post office is located in the Lawrenceville CDP and the Postal Service once instructed Lawrence Township residents to use Lawrenceville, Princeton or Trenton as their mailing address. In 1973, voters approved a nonbinding referendum to petition the U.S. Postal Service to adopt a single municipal post office address known as Lawrenceville for the entire township; The effort failed. A township resident appeared before Township Council in July, 2007, to request to designate the 08648 ZIP code for Lawrence Township. Council approved a resolution in support of the request that was then forwarded to the U.S. Postal Service. Township officials had fought, off and on, for the change since 1969, when then-U.S. Rep. Frank Thompson tried unsuccessfully to convince U.S. Postal Service authorities to grant a Lawrence name tag for the entire township, according to a letter on file at the Municipal Clerk&#x27;s Office. The United States Postal Service notified the township authorities in October 2007 that the preferred designation for the 08648 would be changed to &quot;Lawrence Township&quot;.

Lawrenceville is equidistant between Trenton and Princeton, New Jersey, and approximately fifteen miles closer to Philadelphia than to New York City. Major transportation corridors have passed through Lawrenceville since the town&#x27;s inception, including the King&#x27;s Highway, which in the 18th century approximated today&#x27;s U.S. Route 206. The predominant highway and commercial corridor through Lawrence Township is U.S. Route 1, southeast of Lawrenceville.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Lawrenceville CDP has a total area of , including of land and of water (0.09%). The community is drained by tributaries of Shipetaukin Creek, a southeast-flowing tributary of Assunpink Creek within the Delaware River watershed.

==Education==

The school district covering the CDP is Lawrence Township Public Schools. The Lawrenceville Elementary School, one of the district&#x27;s four elementary schools, is located in Lawrenceville.

Lawrenceville is home to the Lawrenceville School, a private boarding and day high school founded in 1810. It is one of the oldest and most prestigious prep schools in the United States.

==Commerce==

Historically, the Lawrenceville School was the dominant economic force in the village. Since World War II, Lawrenceville has become a commuter town, serving educational and corporate employment centers in Lawrence Township, in Princeton and Trenton, in the surrounding cluster of corporate and research campuses, and to a lesser extent in New York City. There are no large businesses in Lawrenceville itself, but Lawrence Township is home to several large corporate facilities outside of the village, including the world headquarters of Educational Testing Service, offices for the Lenox division of Department 56, the main research facility for Bristol Myers Squibb, and the offices of the Peterson&#x27;s division of Nelnet.

The village businesses share an organization, Lawrenceville Main Street, which organizes events, such as the Music in the Park series, the annual Jubilee, and Taste of Lawrenceville, and promotes the business district to visitors. The Lawrenceville Farmers Market is held every Sunday, from about June to November.

The Lawrenceville Fire Co., Lawrenceville Water Co. (now part of Aqua America), Lawrenceville Fuel, and a U.S. Post Office are also located in Lawrenceville.

Lawrenceville was formerly home to a family grocery, hardware store, pharmacy, and, most famously, the Jigger Shop, which served generations of Lawrenceville School students as a school store and soda fountain. A fire destroyed the shop on August 10, 1990. Caused by faulty electrical cords that ran to a store refrigerator, the fire burned through the store&#x27;s ceiling into the second-floor apartment, which was unoccupied . A new Jigger Shop then opened at the Lawrenceville School and was located on the first floor of the Noyes History Building, until its relocation to the Irwin Dining Center in 2011. After the demolition of the Irwin Dining Center in early 2023, the Jigger Shop was renamed to the Big Red Store and relocated to the newly built Tsai Field House.

The offices of the Princeton Area Community Foundation are in Lawrenceville.

<doc id="89748" wikidata="Q7185566" url="?curid=89748" title="Philistia">
<text>Philistia was a confederation of five main cities or pentapolis in the Southwest Levant, made up of principally Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, Gath, and for a time, Jaffa (part of present-day Tel Aviv-Yafo).

Scholars believe the Philistines were made up of people of an Aegean background that from roughly 1200 BC onwards settled in the area and mixed with the local Canaanite population, and came to be known as &quot;Peleset&quot;, or Philistines. At its maximum territorial expansion, its territory may have stretched along the Canaanite coast from Arish in the Sinai (today&#x27;s Egypt) to the Yarkon River (today&#x27;s Tel Aviv), and as far inland as Ekron and Gath. Nebuchadnezzar II invaded Philistia in 604 BC, burned Ashkelon, and incorporated the territory in the Neo-Babylonian Empire; Philistia and its native population the Philistines disappear from the historic record after that year.

==History==
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic records from the New Kingdom period record a group of the Sea Peoples called the &quot;pwrꜣsꜣtj&quot;, generally transliterated as either &quot;Peleset&quot; or &quot;Pulasti&quot;, as invading Egypt in the mid-13th century BC. About a century later, pharaoh Ramesses III boasted of having defeated the &quot;Peleset&quot;, and allegedly relocated them to the southern abandoned coast of Canaan, recording this victory on a Medinet Habu temple inscription dated to c. 1150 BC. The &quot;pwrꜣsꜣtj&quot; are generally identified as the Philistines. The Great Harris Papyrus, a chronicle of Ramesses&#x27; reign written no later than 1149 BC, also records this Egyptian defeat of the Philistines.

Despite Ramesses III&#x27;s claim, archaeology has not been able to corroborate the existence of any such (re)settlement, and the lack of sense in granting an apparently barbarous invading people an expansive and richly fertile swath of land already under Egyptian control is noted by scholars.

During Iron Age I, the Philistines seem to have had a presence far outside of what was traditionally considered Philistia, as 23 of the 26 Iron Age I sites in the Jezreel Valley, including Tel Megiddo, Tel Yokneam, Tel Qiri, Afula, Tel Qashish, Be&#x27;er Tiveon, Hurvat Hazin, Tel Risim, Tel Re&#x27;ala, Hurvat Tzror, Tel Sham, Midrakh Oz and Tel Zariq, yielded typical Philistine pottery dating from the 12th-to-10th century BC. However, given the minuscule quantity of said pottery finds, it is likely that even if the Philistines had by-and-large settled in the area, they remained a minority which had assimilated into the native Canaanite population by the 10th century BC.
In its historical form, Philistia&#x27;s northern boundary was the Yarkon River, with the Mediterranean Sea on the west, the Kingdom of Judah at Ziklag to the east, and the Arish to the south. Philistia consisted of the five city-states of the Philistines, known as the Philistine pentapolis, described in the Book of Joshua () and the Books of Samuel (), comprising Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza, in the south-western Levant. Tell Qasile and Aphek (see Battle of Aphek) likely marked the nation&#x27;s frontiers, as evidence from Tell Qasile especially indicates that non-Philistines constituted an otherwise unusually large portion of their respective populations. The identity of the aforementioned Ziklag, a city which according to the Bible marked the border between the Philistine and Israelite territory, remains uncertain.

Philistia included Jaffa (in today&#x27;s Tel Aviv), but it was lost to the Hebrews during Solomon&#x27;s time. Nonetheless, the Philistine king of Ashkelon conquered Jaffa again circa 730 BC. Following Sennacherib&#x27;s third campaign in the Levant, the Assyrians reassigned Jaffa to the Phoenician city-state of Sidon, and Philistia never got it back.

The Five Lords of the Philistines are described in the Hebrew Bible as being in constant struggle and interaction with the neighbouring Israelites, Canaanites and Egyptians, being gradually absorbed into the Canaanite culture.

Philistia was occupied by Tiglath-Pileser III of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BC. Throughout the century, often at the incitement of neighboring Egypt, Philistia revolted against Assyrian rule, but each time they were defeated and forced to pay tribute. Gath disappears from history after Sargon II records its capture in 711 BC, which may indicate he destroyed the city rather than conquered it. The term &quot;Philistia&quot; is not used in Assyrian records describing their campaigns, only the names of individual cities, which may indicate that at this stage the Philistines had become increasingly divided, and that the confederation of the pentapolis which constituted Philistia had fractured into separate city-states. Sennacherib further reported that he had sacked (and possibly burned) a &quot;royal city of the land Philistia that [Hezek]iah had taken away (and) fortified,&quot; but the city&#x27;s name has not survived. The texts also mention that Ashkelon was also sacked due to its refusal to acknowledge Assyrian authority. Despite this Philistine sedition, Sennacherib records that he divided up the lands he had plundered from Judah amongst the kings of Ashdod, Gaza, and Ekron, even going as far as freeing Padi, the king of Ekron, from Judahite captivity and returning him to the throne.

The Philistines disappear from written records following the conquest of the Levant by the Neo-Babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar II during the 6th century BC, when Ashkelon and many other cities from the region were destroyed.

==East of Gaza==
The area east of Gaza, particularly around Nahal Besor that reaches into the hills as far as Beersheva, had a very substantial Philistine presence. This area is a part of the Negev desert. It also includes Nahal Gerar to the north that joins Nahal Besor before flowing into the Mediterranean Sea.

This was a heavily populated area during the early Iron Age. It includes archaeological sites such as Tell Beit Mirsim, Tel Haror, Tel Sera (Ziklag) along Nahal Gerar, and Tell Jemmeh and Tell el-Far&#x27;ah (South) along Nahal Besor. All these sites and others in the area had Philistine settlements.

When the Neo-Assyrian Empire first invaded this area, the Philistine cities were given considerable autonomy in exchange for tribute. But having responded to various revolts, this policy hardened.

<text>Portland Street () is a popular street in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The street is the location of the business and retailing skyscraper complex, Langham Place, numerous restaurants and its red-light district.

==Geography==
Running north–south and parallel to (and west of) Nathan Road, a main thoroughfare up the Kowloon peninsula, Portland Street extends through the districts of Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok in Kowloon. Approximately three-quarters of a mile (one and a fifth kilometres) in length, it spans between Boundary Street in the north and Man Ming Lane, at one block past Waterloo Road in the south. The street is directly accessible by the Prince Edward, Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei stations of the MTR, Hong Kong&#x27;s subway system.

Except for a few small parks, the entire two-lane street is highly urbanised with dense pedestrian and motor traffic throughout most of the day. Like most north–south streets on the peninsula it is numbered south to north.

==Character==
A section of Portland Street, particularly between Argyle Street and Dundas Street, hosts arguably Hong Kong&#x27;s most famous red light district (serving mostly local Chinese clientele) and a popular scene in Hong Kong films. There, underneath a dizzying and chaotic array of neon signs, one can find prostitutes from around the world (although mostly from mainland China) serving in hundreds of massage parlours, night clubs, karaoke/hostess bars and brothels. Although prostitution is legal in Hong Kong, law enforcement is often active in this area conducting raids for prostitutes who entered Hong Kong illegally or have overstayed their visas or to search for under-aged prostitutes, pimps, human traffickers and triad activities.

Langham Place, a 167,000-square metre (1.8 million-square foot) shopping centre, theatre, hotel and office tower complex opened on Portland Street near the Nelson Street intersection in July 2004. The complex has its own MTR station access (Mong Kok station exit C3). Outside one of the complex&#x27;s east entrances is a large &#x27;jumbotron&#x27; broadcasting news and entertainment shows for pedestrians below. Since its opening, Langham Place and surrounding areas has become a popular night-time destination for both locals and tourists. Some had predicted the massive upscale development would gentrify the area and drive away the Portland Street sex trade. However, after several years of operation, Langham Place&#x27;s impact on the nearby sex industry remains minimal.

The Portland Street segment between Argyle Street and Bute Street is home to over 50 retailers selling home renovation materials and supplies such as toilet utensils, tiles, and wallpapers.

Other establishments along Portland Street includes fast-food restaurants, congee/noodle shops, convenience stores and working class residential highrises. Near the Soy Street intersection during the evenings, there are often unlicensed food stands and professional Chinese Chess players plying their trades. Further south, there is a small public playground at the Changsha Street intersection.

==History==
Portland Street was named after William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1783 and between 1807 and 1809. It is unclear why the street was bestowed in his honour although, as a former British colony, many of Hong Kong&#x27;s streets and institutions were named in memory of prominent English historic and political figures. Surrounding streets with similarly naming scheme include Pitt Street, Bute Street, Arran Street, Hamilton Street, Dundas Street and Waterloo Road.

There is a street in London named Great Portland Street. There is also a street in Edinburgh named Portland Street which is not far from Pitt Street and Dundas Street (as mentioned above, Hong Kong&#x27;s Portland Street is also nearby Pitt Street and Dundas Street). In both cases it is not clear if there is any relation or relevance to the Hong Kong Portland Street.

<doc id="89753" wikidata="Q218022" url="?curid=89753" title="Alain Resnais">
<text>Alain Resnais (; 3 June 19221 March 2014) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades. After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct short films including &quot;Night and Fog&quot; (1956), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps. 

Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and consolidated his early reputation with (1959), &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (1961), and &quot;Muriel&quot; (1963), all of which adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary with, and associated with, the French New Wave (&quot;la nouvelle vague&quot;), though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that movement. He had closer links to the &quot;Left Bank&quot; group of authors and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest in left-wing politics. He also established a regular practice of working on his films in collaboration with writers previously unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg.

In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music, and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films featuring various kinds of popular song.

His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness, memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising innovative formal structures for his narratives. 

Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film festivals and academies, including one Academy Award, two César Awards for best director (he was nominated on eight occasions), three Louis Delluc Prize and one Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

==Early life==
Resnais was born in 1922 at Vannes in Brittany, where his father was a pharmacist. An only child, he was often ill with asthma in childhood, which led to his being withdrawn from school and educated at home. He was an eager reader, in a range that extended from classics to comic books, but from the age of 10 he became fascinated by films. For his twelfth birthday his parents gave him a Kodak 8mm camera with which he began to make his own short films, including a three-minute version of &quot;Fantômas&quot;. Around the age of 14, he discovered surrealism and through that an interest in the works of André Breton.

Visits to the theatre in Paris gave Resnais the desire to be an actor, and in 1939 he moved to Paris to become an assistant in Georges Pitoëff&#x27;s company at the Théâtre des Mathurins. From 1940 to 1942 he studied acting in the Cours René-Simon (and one of his small jobs at this time was as an extra in the film &quot;Les Visiteurs du soir&quot;), but he then decided in 1943 to apply to the newly formed film school IDHEC to study film editing. The filmmaker Jean Grémillon was one of the teachers who had the most influence on him at that period.

Resnais left in 1945 to do his military service which took him to Germany and Austria with the occupying French forces, as well as making him a temporary member of a travelling theatre company, Les Arlequins. He returned to Paris in 1946 to start his career as a film editor, but also began making short films of his own. Finding himself to be a neighbour of the actor Gérard Philipe, he persuaded him to appear in a 16mm surrealist short, &quot;Schéma d&#x27;une identification&quot; (now lost). A more ambitious feature-length work, &quot;Ouvert pour cause d&#x27;inventaire&quot;, has also vanished without trace.

==Career==

===1946–1958: short films===
After beginning with a series of short documentary films showing artists at work in their studios, as well as a few commercial commissions, Resnais was invited in 1948 to make a film about the paintings of Van Gogh, to coincide with an exhibition that was being mounted in Paris. He filmed it at first in 16mm, but when the producer Pierre Braunberger saw the results, Resnais was asked to remake it in 35mm. &quot;Van Gogh&quot; received a prize at the Venice Biennale in 1948, and also won an Oscar for Best 2-reel Short in 1949. (Braunberger went on to act as producer for several of Resnais&#x27;s films in the following decade.) Resnais continued to address artistic subjects in &quot;Gauguin&quot; (1950) and &quot;Guernica&quot; (1950), which examined the Picasso painting based on the 1937 bombing of the town, and presented it to the accompaniment of a text written by Paul Éluard. A political perspective on art also underpinned his next project (co-directed with Chris Marker), &quot;Les statues meurent aussi&quot; (&quot;Statues Also Die&quot;, 1953), a polemic about the destruction of African art by French cultural colonialism.

&quot;Nuit et Brouillard&quot; (&quot;Night and Fog&quot;, 1956) was one of the first documentaries about the Nazi concentration camps, but it deals more with the memory of the camps than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting the enormity of the horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images of the camps with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor of the camps) was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect. Although the film encountered censorship problems with the French government, its impact was immense and it remains one of the director&#x27;s most admired works.

A different kind of collective memory was considered in &quot;Toute la mémoire du monde&quot; (1956), in which the seemingly endless spaces and bibliographic riches of the Bibliothèque nationale were explored in another compendium of long travelling shots. The film was referenced in the novel, Austerlitz by W.G. Sebald portraying the library as &quot;an immensely complex and constantly evolving creature which had to be fed with myriads of words, in order to bring forth myriads of words in its own turn.&quot;

In 1958 Resnais undertook a commission from the Pechiney company to make short film, in colour and wide-screen, extolling the merits of plastics, &quot;Le Chant du styrène&quot;. Poetry was brought to the project, literally, by Raymond Queneau who wrote the narration for the film in rhyming couplets.

In his decade of making documentary short films, Resnais established his interest in and talent for collaboration with leading figures in other branches of the arts: with the painters who were the subjects of his early works; with writers (Eluard in &quot;Guernica&quot;, Cayrol in &quot;Nuit et Brouillard&quot;, Queneau in &quot;Le Chant du styrène&quot;); with musicians (Darius Milhaud in &quot;Gauguin&quot;, Hanns Eisler in &quot;Nuit et Brouillard&quot;, Pierre Barbaud in &quot;Le Chant du styrène&quot;); and with other filmmakers (Resnais was the editor of Agnès Varda&#x27;s first film, &quot;La Pointe courte&quot;, and co-directed with Chris Marker &quot;Les statues meurent aussi&quot;). Similar collaborations underpinned his future work in feature films.

===1959–1968===

Resnais&#x27;s first feature film was (1959). It originated as a commission from the producers of &quot;Nuit et Brouillard&quot; (Anatole Dauman and Argos Films) to make a documentary about the atomic bomb, but Resnais initially declined, thinking that it would be too similar to the earlier film about the concentration camps and that it presented the same problem of how to film incomprehensible suffering. However, in discussion with the novelist Marguerite Duras a fusion of fiction and documentary was developed which acknowledged the impossibility of speaking &quot;about&quot; Hiroshima; one could only speak about the impossibility of speaking about Hiroshima. In the film, the themes of memory and forgetting are explored via new narrative techniques which balance images with narrated text and ignore conventional notions of plot and story development. The film was shown at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, alongside Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Les Quatre Cents Coups&quot; (&quot;The 400 Blows&quot;), and its success became associated with the emerging movement of the French New Wave.

Resnais&#x27;s next film was &quot;L&#x27;Année dernière à Marienbad&quot; (&quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;, 1961), which he made in collaboration with the novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet. The fragmented and shifting narrative presents three principal characters, a woman and two men, in the opulent setting of a grand European hotel or château where the possibility of a previous encounter a year ago is repeatedly asserted and questioned and contradicted. After winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, the film attracted great attention and provoked many divergent interpretations of how it should be understood, encouraged by interviews in which Robbe-Grillet and Resnais themselves appeared to give conflicting explanations of the film. There was little doubt however that it represented a significant challenge to the traditional concept of narrative construction in cinema.

At the beginning of the 1960s France remained deeply divided by the Algerian War, and in 1960 the Manifesto of the 121, which protested against French military policy in Algeria, was signed by a group of leading intellectuals and artists who included Resnais. The war, and the difficulty of coming to terms with its horrors, was a central theme of his next film &quot;Muriel&quot; (1963), which used a fractured narrative to explore the mental states of its characters. It was among the first French films to comment, even indirectly, on the Algerian experience.

A contemporary political issue also formed the background for &quot;La guerre est finie&quot; (&quot;The War Is Over&quot;, 1966), this time the clandestine activities of left-wing opponents of the Franco government in Spain. Resnais&#x27;s scriptwriter on this film was the Spanish author Jorge Semprún, himself an ex-member of the Spanish Communist Party now in voluntary exile in France. Both men denied that the film was &quot;about&quot; Spain, but when it was entered for the official competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1966, an objection from the Spanish government caused it to be withdrawn and it was shown out of competition. In 1967 Resnais participated with six other directors, including Chris Marker and Jean-Luc Godard, in a collective work about the Vietnam war, &quot;Loin du Vietnam&quot; (&quot;Far from Vietnam&quot;).

From 1968 onwards, Resnais&#x27;s films no longer addressed, at least directly, big political issues in the way that a number of his previous ones had done, and his next project seemed to mark a change of direction. &quot;Je t&#x27;aime, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (1968) drew upon the traditions of science-fiction for a story of a man sent back into his past, a theme which enabled Resnais again to present a narrative of fragmented time. Alain Resnais&#x27;s scriptwriter on this film was the author Jacques Sternberg. The film was unlucky in its release (its planned screening at Cannes was cancelled amid the political events of May 1968), and it was almost five years before Resnais was able to direct another film.

Throughout the 1960s, Resnais was attached to direct an international production called &quot;Les Aventures de Harry Dickson&quot;, based on the stories by Jean Ray, with Anatole Dauman as producer. The project was intended to star either Dirk Bogarde or Laurence Olivier as the titular detective, with André Delvaux attached as the production designer, and the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen attached for the score. Resnais and Dauman worked towards the project for a decade before finally giving up. The screenplay for the film by Frédéric de Towarnicki was published in 2007.

===1969–1980===
Resnais spent some time in America working on various unfulfilled projects, including one about the Marquis de Sade. He also published &quot;Repérages&quot;, a volume of his photographs, taken between 1948 and 1971, of locations in London, Scotland, Paris, Nevers, Lyon, New York and Hiroshima; Jorge Semprun wrote the introductory text. Some of the photographs relate to his unfulfilled Harry Dickson film.

After contributing an episode to &quot;L&#x27;An 01 (The Year 01)&quot; (1973), a collective film organised by Jacques Doillon, Resnais made a second collaboration with Jorge Semprun for &quot;Stavisky&quot; (1974), based on the life of the notorious financier and embezzler whose death in 1934 provoked a political scandal. With glamorous costumes and sets, a musical score by Stephen Sondheim, and Jean-Paul Belmondo in the title role, it was seen as Resnais&#x27;s most commercial film to date, but its complex narrative structure showed clear links with the formal preoccupations of his earlier films.

With &quot;Providence&quot; (1977), Resnais made his first film in English, with a screenplay written by David Mercer, and a cast that included John Gielgud, Dirk Bogarde and Ellen Burstyn. The story shows an ageing, maybe dying, novelist grappling with alternative versions of his own past as he adapts them for his fiction. Resnais was eager that the dark subject should remain humorous, and he described it as &quot;a macabre divertissement&quot;. Formal innovation characterised &quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot; (&quot;My American Uncle&quot;, 1980) in which the theories of the neurobiologist Henri Laborit about animal behaviour are juxtaposed with three interwoven fictional stories; and a further counterpoint to the fictional characters is provided by the inclusion of film extracts of the classic French film actors with whom they identify. The film won several international awards including the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, and it also proved to be one of Resnais&#x27;s most successful with the public.

===1981–2014===
From the 1980s onwards Resnais showed a particular interest in integrating material from other forms of popular culture into his films, drawing especially on music and the theatre. In almost all of his remaining films he chose to work repeatedly with a core group of actors comprising Sabine Azéma, Pierre Arditi, and André Dussollier, sometimes accompanied by Fanny Ardant or Lambert Wilson. The first four of these were among the large cast of &quot;La vie est un roman&quot; (&quot;Life Is a Bed of Roses&quot;, 1983), a comic fantasy about utopian dreams in which three stories, from different eras and told in different styles, are interwoven within a shared setting. The action is punctuated by episodes of song which develop towards the end into scenes that are almost operatic; Resnais said that his starting point had been the desire to make a film in which dialogue and song would alternate.
Music, very differently used, was a major component of &quot;L&#x27;Amour à mort&quot; (&quot;Love unto Death&quot;, 1984). For this intense chamber work with four principal actors (Azéma, Arditi, Ardant and Dussollier), Resnais asked Hans Werner Henze to compose musical episodes which would act as a &quot;fifth character&quot;, not an accompaniment but a fully integrated element of the drama with which the speech of the actors would interact. In subsequent years, Resnais gave his attention to music of more popular styles. He made &quot;Gershwin&quot; (1992), an innovative TV documentary in which the American composer&#x27;s life and works were reviewed through the testimonies of performers and filmmakers, juxtaposed with commissioned paintings by Guy Peellaert. In &quot;On connaît la chanson&quot; (&quot;Same Old Song&quot;, 1997), his tribute to television works of Dennis Potter, the characters express their key emotions or private thoughts by bursting into snatches of well-known (recorded) popular songs without interrupting the dramatic situation. A long-neglected operetta from the 1920s was the unexpected basis for Resnais&#x27;s next film &quot;Pas sur la bouche&quot; (&quot;Not on the Lips&quot;, 2003), in which he sought to reinvigorate an unfashionable form of entertainment by recreating its theatricality for the camera and entrusting most of its musical numbers to actors rather than to trained singers.

There are many references to the theatre throughout Resnais&#x27;s filmmaking (&quot;Marienbad&quot;, &quot;Muriel&quot;, &quot;Stavisky&quot;, &quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot;), but he first undertook the challenge of taking a complete stage work and giving it new cinematic life in &quot;Mélo&quot; (1986), an adaptation of Henri Bernstein&#x27;s 1929 play of the same name. Resnais remained entirely faithful to the play (apart from shortening it) and he emphasised its theatricality by filming in long takes on large sets of evidently artificial design, as well as by marking off the acts of the play with the fall of a curtain. After an excursion into the world of comic books and cartoons in &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot; (1989), an ambitious theatrical adaptation followed with the diptych of &quot;Smoking/No Smoking&quot; (1993). Resnais, having admired the plays of Alan Ayckbourn for many years, chose to adapt what appeared the most intractable of them, &quot;Intimate Exchanges&quot;, a series of eight interlinked plays which follow the consequences of a casual choice to sixteen possible endings. Resnais slightly reduced the number of permuted endings and compressed the plays into two films, each having a common starting point, and to be seen in any order. Sabine Azéma and Pierre Arditi played all the parts, and the theatricality of the undertaking was again emphasised by the studio set designs for a fictional English village. Resnais returned to Ayckbourn in the following decade for his adaptation of &quot;Private Fears in Public Places&quot; to which he gave the film title of &quot;Cœurs&quot; (2006). Among the stage/film effects which contribute to its mood of &quot;cheerful desolation&quot; is the artificial snow which is continually seen through set windows until eventually it falls on the studio interior as well.

Speaking in 1986, Resnais said that he did not make a separation between cinema and theatre and refused to make enemies of them. He preferred working with &quot;people of the theatre&quot;, and he said that he would never want to film a novel. It was therefore something of a departure when he chose &quot;L&#x27;Incident&quot;, a novel by Christian Gailly, as the basis for &quot;Les Herbes folles&quot; (&quot;Wild Grass&quot;, 2009). He explained however that what initially attracted him to the book was the quality of its dialogue, which he retained largely unchanged for the film. When &quot;Les Herbes folles&quot; was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, it was the occasion for a special jury award to Resnais &quot;for his work and exceptional contribution to the history of cinema&quot;.

In his final two films, Resnais again drew his source material from the theatre. &quot;Vous n&#x27;avez encore rien vu&quot; (&quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothin&#x27; Yet!&quot;, 2012) was adapted from two plays by Jean Anouilh, and it assembled thirteen actors (many of them regular performers in Resnais&#x27;s earlier films) who have been summoned by the dying wish of an author to witness a new performance their roles in one of his plays. The film was shown in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Aimer, boire et chanter&quot; (2014) was the third film which Resnais adapted from a play by Alan Ayckbourn, in this case &quot;Life of Riley&quot;, in which three couples are thrown into confusion by the news that a shared friend has a terminal illness. Three weeks before Resnais&#x27;s death, the film received its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014, where it won a Silver Bear award &quot;for a feature film that opens new perspectives&quot;. At the time of his death, Resnais was preparing a further Ayckbourn project, based on the 2013 play &quot;Arrivals &amp; Departures&quot;.

==Reputation==
Resnais was often linked with the group of French filmmakers who made their breakthrough as the New Wave or &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; in the late 1950s, but by then he had already established a significant reputation through his ten years of work on documentary short films. He defined his own relationship by saying: &quot;Although I was not fully part of the New Wave because of my age, there was some mutual sympathy and respect between myself and Rivette, Bazin, Demy, Truffaut ... So I felt friendly with that team.&quot; He nevertheless acknowledged his debt to the New Wave because it created the conditions of production, and particularly the financial conditions, which allowed him to make a film like , his first feature film.

Resnais was more often associated with a &quot;Left Bank&quot; group of writers and filmmakers who included Agnès Varda, Chris Marker, Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet (with all of whom he collaborated in the earlier part of his career). They were distinguished by their interests in documentary, left-wing politics, and the literary experiments of the &quot;nouveau roman&quot;. At the same time, Resnais was also a devotee of popular culture. He owned the largest private collection of comic books in France and in 1962 became the vice president and co-founder of an International Society for Comic Books, &quot;Le Club des bandes dessinées&quot;, renamed two years later as &quot;Centre d&#x27;Études des Littératures d&#x27;Expression Graphique (CELEG)&quot;. CELEG members also included Resnais&#x27;s artistic collaborators Marker and Robbe-Grillet.

The importance of creative collaboration in Resnais&#x27;s films has been noted by many commentators. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he always refused to write his own screenplays and attached great importance to the contribution of his chosen writer, whose status in the shared &quot;authorship&quot; of the film he fully acknowledged. He was also known to treat the completed screenplay with great fidelity, to the extent that some of his screenwriters remarked on how closely the finished film realised their intentions. (On the few occasions when he did participate in writing the script, particularly for his last three films, his contribution is acknowledged under the pseudonym Alex Reval, since he did not want his name to appear more than once in the credits.)

Time and memory have regularly been identified as two of the principal themes of Resnais&#x27;s work, at least in his earlier films. He however consistently tried to modify this view of his concerns: &quot;I prefer to speak of the imaginary, or of consciousness. What interests me in the mind is that faculty we have to imagine what is going to happen in our heads, or to remember what has happened&quot;. He also described his films as an attempt, however imperfect, to approach the complexity of thought and its mechanism.

Another view of the evolution of Resnais&#x27;s career saw him moving progressively away from a realistic treatment of &#x27;big&#x27; subjects and overtly political themes towards films that are increasingly personal and playful. Resnais himself offered an explanation of this shift in terms of challenging what was the norm in filmmaking at the time: having made his early films when escapist cinema was predominant, he progressively felt the need to move away from exploration of social and political issues as that itself became almost the norm in contemporary cinema. Experimentation with narrative forms and genre conventions instead became a central focus of his films.

A frequent criticism of Resnais&#x27;s films among English-language commentators has been that they are emotionally cold; that they are all about technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised by a lack of sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have been able to make the connection between the film&#x27;s form and its human dimension.

There is general agreement about Resnais&#x27;s attachment to formalism in his approach to film; he himself regarded it as the starting point of his work, and usually had an idea of a form, or method of construction, in his head even before the plot or the characters took shape. For him this was also the basis for the communication of feeling: &quot;There cannot be any communication except through form. If there is no form, you cannot create emotion in the spectator.&quot;

Another term which appears in commentaries on Resnais throughout his career is &quot;surrealism&quot;, from his documentary portrait of a library in &quot;Toute la mémoire du monde&quot;, through the dreamlike innovations of &quot;Marienbad&quot;, to the latterday playfulness of &quot;Les Herbes folles&quot;. Resnais himself traced a link to his teenage discovery of surrealism in the works of André Breton: &quot;I hope that I always remain faithful to André Breton who refused to suppose that imaginary life was not a part of real life&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1969 Resnais married Florence Malraux (daughter of the French statesman and writer André Malraux). She was a regular member of his production team, working as assistant director on most of his films from 1961 to 1986. 

His second wife was Sabine Azéma, who acted in the majority of his films from 1983 onwards; they were married in the English town of Scarborough in 1998.

On his religious views, he called himself a &quot;mystical atheist&quot;.

Resnais died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 1 March 2014; he was buried in Montparnasse cemetery.

<text>The baht (; , ; sign: ฿; code: THB) is the official currency of Thailand. It is divided into 100 &quot;satang&quot; (, ). Prior to decimalisation, the baht was divided into eight &quot;fueang&quot; (, ), each of eight &quot;at&quot; (, ). The issuance of currency is the responsibility of the Bank of Thailand. SWIFT ranked the Thai baht as the 10th-most-frequently used world payment currency as of December 2023.

== History ==

The Thai baht, like the pound, originated from a traditional unit of mass. Its currency value was originally expressed as that of silver of corresponding weight (now defined as 15 grams), and was in use probably as early as the Sukhothai period in the form of bullet coins known in Thai as &quot;photduang&quot;. These were pieces of solid silver cast to various weights corresponding to a traditional system of units related by simple fractions and multiples, one of which is the &quot;baht&quot;. These are listed in the following table: Though the coins themselves have names like: &quot;solot&quot;, &quot;siao&quot;,&quot; sik&quot;, etc, the formal division of the Thai baht (tical) is 1 baht = 8 &quot;fueang&quot; = 64 &quot;at&quot;. This means that &quot;one baht&quot; is divided into &quot;eight fueang&quot;, and each &quot;one fueang&quot; is divided into &quot;8 at&quot;. Currently, the Thai baht do not employ the &quot;at&quot; as a subunit, but the &quot;at&quot; is the current subunit of the Lao kip.

This predecimal system was in use up until 1897, when the decimal system devised by Prince Jayanta Mongkol, in which one baht = 100 satang, was introduced by his half-brother King Chulalongkorn along with the demonetization of silver bullet coins on 28 October 1904 after the end of silver bullet coin production by the opening of Sitthikarn Royal Mint in 1857. However, coins denominated in the old units were issued until 1910, and the amount of 25 satang is still commonly referred to as a , as is the 25-satang coin.

Until 27 November 1902, the baht was fixed on a purely silver basis, with 15 grams of silver to the baht. This caused the value of the currency to vary relative to currencies on a gold standard. From 1856 to 1864, the values of certain foreign silver coins were fixed by law, with 5 baht = 3 Spanish dollar = 7 Indian rupees. Before 1880 the exchange rate was fixed at 8 baht per pound sterling, falling to 10 to the pound during the 1880s.

In 1902, the government began to increase the value of the baht by following all increases in the value of silver against gold but not reducing it when the silver price fell. Beginning at 21.75 baht per pound sterling, the currency rose in value until, in 1908, a fixed peg to the British pound sterling was established of 13 baht per pound. This was revised to 12 baht in 1919 and then, after a period of instability, to 11 baht in 1923. During World War II, the baht was fixed at a value of one Japanese yen on 22 April 1942.

From 1956 until 1973, the baht was pegged to the US dollar at an exchange rate of 20.8 baht = one dollar and at 20 baht = 1 dollar until 1978.
 A strengthening US economy caused Thailand to re-peg its currency at 25 to the dollar from 1984 until 2 July 1997, when the country was affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The baht was floated and halved in value, reaching its lowest rate of 56 to the dollar in January 1998. It rose to 30 per dollar in January 2021.

The baht was originally known to foreigners by the term &quot;tical&quot;, which was used in English language text on banknotes until the series 2 1925.

== Currency symbol ==
The currency symbol for the baht is (a Latin letter B with a vertical stroke). In 1986, this symbol was given a codepoint for computer use in the Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533 (Thailand&#x27;s extension of ASCII), at position 0xDF. This national standard was subsequently subsumed into international standards as ISO/IEC 8859-11 (&quot;ISO Latin-Thai&quot;). In turn, the ISO 8859 series were transposed into the Unicode standard, where the symbol was allocated the codepoint .
The symbol is also used for the Panamanian balboa.

=== Abbreviation ===
In Thai usage, the baht () is legally abbreviated as according to Section 7 of the Currency Act, B.E. 2501.

=== Bitcoin ===
For a time, the baht symbol was appropriated by some as a symbol for Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. Following representations, a separate code point (, a Latin letter B with two vertical strokes) was allocated in Unicode version 10.0.

=== Square katakana ===

In Unicode 1.0, two codepoints were allocated to the baht, one as the currency symbol in the Thai range and one in the CJK Compatibility block as a square version of the Japanese word for &quot;baht&quot;, written in katakana script. The CJK codepoint, , is documented in subsequent versions of the standard as &quot;a mistaken, unused representation&quot; and users are directed to instead. Consequently, only a few computer fonts have any content for this codepoint and its use is deprecated.

(The Japanese for &quot;baht&quot; is (). However, the reference glyph and the character name correspond to (, from English &quot;parts&quot;).)

=== Historical symbols used before decimalization ===
Before decimalization, the Siamese government employed Chinese, Latin, Jawi (Malay), Devanagari, Khmer and Khom, Lanna, and Burmese scripts  in banknotes and coins, as seen. The reason is not clear, though it is a common understanding that it is to ease the facilicitation of trade within Siam. It could also be the case that at the time, the capital, Bangkok (Phra Nakhon) was still a multi-cultural city, so as to be more inclusive, the government added various other language onto the currency - though by the second series after the decimalization in the 1900s, the currency was all but monolingual.

 (): This character was use during the times of Rama IV to represent baht, though this was phased out by another character which is in partially and informally used today. The only occurrence of this character was in Rama IV&#x27;s banknote series.

 (): This character was in use from 1868–1925 officially on banknotes to represent baht. It is still in use today unofficially to refer to the Thai baht in general, as in or .

 (): This character was in use from 1851–1908 officially on banknotes and coins to represent salueng.

 (): This character was in use from 1851–1908 officially on banknotes and coins to represent fueang.

The notation for these Chinese character are written like they are in Thai, though there is a caveat: it is written right to left, as was the convention back then, so one baht is written or , if there are smaller units involved the notation can write like such: for one baht, three salueng, and one fueang.

=== Summary ===
=== Mint involved in producing Siamese and Thai coins ===
=== &quot;Photduang&quot; coinage ===

Cowrie shells from the Mekong River had been used as currency for small amounts since the Sukhothai period. Before 1860, Thailand did not produce coins using modern methods. Instead, a so-called &quot;bullet&quot; coinage was used, consisting of bars of metal, thicker in the middle, bent round to form a complete circle on which identifying marks were stamped. Denominations issued included , , , , , , 1, , 2, , 4, , 8, 10, 20, 40 and 80 baht in silver and , , , , 1, , 2 and 4 baht in gold. One gold baht was generally worth 16 silver baht. Between 1858 and 1860, foreign trade coins were also stamped by the government for use in Thailand.

==== Sukhothai and Ayutthaya &quot;photduang&quot; ====
&quot;Photduang&quot;, a form of currency used during the Sukhothai period, was characterized by its longer legs, which created a larger and wider hole in the middle. These coins were primarily made of silver and featured a cut across the front of each leg. This cut served a dual purpose: it authenticated the money and allowed for the quality of the silver to be tested. Over time, as the Sukhothai Kingdom declined and became a vassal state of Ayutthaya—which was established as the capital in 1350—the design of &quot;photduang&quot; evolved. The coins became rounder with shorter legs, and the central hole, while still present, grew smaller. By the end of this era, the hole disappeared completely. The cuts on the legs also reduced in size and were eventually replaced by a small elliptical nick, known as &quot;Met Kao San,&quot; on one side of the coin.

==== Thonburi and Rattanakosin &quot;photduang&quot; ====
The Thonburi period (1767–1782) and the Rattanakosin period, beginning in 1782, adopted the &quot;photduang&quot; design from the late Ayutthaya period. The coins from these periods had no central hole, and the legs were even shorter. A key difference was that Thonburi &quot;photduang&quot; lacked the elliptical nick, whereas the Rattanakosin coins reintroduced this feature, similar to the Ayutthaya coins. &quot;Photduang&quot; from these later periods typically featured two stamped marks: the dynasty mark on top and the king&#x27;s personal mark on the front part. The dynasty mark often symbolized the kingdom&#x27;s ruling dynasty, while the king&#x27;s personal mark represented the reigning monarch.

==== Markings on the &quot;photduang&quot; ====
The markings on &quot;photduang&quot; coins varied across different periods. During the Sukhothai era, some coins bore no marks, while others had up to 11. This variation was because, at that time, individuals and merchants could produce their own money. However, from the Ayutthaya period onward, the production of &quot;photduang&quot; was monopolized by the government, making it easier to identify coins from each era. Ayutthaya &quot;photduang&quot; typically bore two marks: the dynasty mark, which could be a spoked wheel symbolizing the &quot;Wheel of Law&quot; from Buddhist teachings or the Chakra (Vishnu&#x27;s weapon), represented by a pattern of 8 dots surrounding a central dot. The king&#x27;s personal mark varied with each ruler and included symbols such as a conch shell, a Garuda bird (&quot;khrut&quot;), an elephant, and an anchor, each symbolizing different aspects of the king&#x27;s reign or divine associations.

==== &quot;Photduang&quot; timeline ====
 &quot;*continues in the coin section*&quot;

=== Predecimal coinage ===
Rama III (1824–1851) was the first king to consider the use of a flat coin. He did so not for the convenience of traders, but because he was disturbed that the creatures living in the cowrie shells were killed. When he learned of the use of flat copper coins in Singapore in 1835, he contacted a Scottish trader, who had two types of experimental coins struck in England. The king rejected both designs. The name of the country put on these first coins was &quot;Muang Thai&quot;, not &quot;Siam&quot;.

In 1860, modern-style coins were introduced. These were silver 1 &quot;sik&quot;; 1 &quot;fueang&quot;; 1 and 2 &quot;salueng&quot;; 1, 2, and 4 baht; with the baht weighing 15.244 grams and the others weight-related. Tin 1 &quot;solot&quot; and 1 &quot;at&quot; followed in 1862, with gold , 4, and 8 baht introduced in 1863 and copper 2 and 4 &quot;at&quot; in 1865. Copper replaced tin in the 1 &quot;solot&quot; and 1 &quot;at&quot; in 1874, with copper 4 at introduced in 1876. The last gold coins were struck in 1895.

==== Coin timeline ====
==== Issue 1 - 1856 (transitional) ====
The first issue of coins were commissioned by Rama IV, though it was never brought into circulation. This was one of the first attempt to replace the bullet coins, but few were ever minted without making it into circulation.
==== Issue 2 - 1860 ====
The first circulating issue of the Siamese coins. This marked the start of the move away from using &quot;photduang&quot; currency. Though in this era, the &quot;photduang&quot; were still legal tender. In this series, the lower denominations were made of silver, and the higher ones were made of gold. These higher denominations were given nicknames: &quot;pot dueng&quot;, &quot;pit&quot;, and &quot;tot&quot;. &quot;Pot dueng&quot; means thirty two, as in 1/32 of a &quot;chang&quot;. The other nickname was the &quot;chinkang&quot; or one Chinese &quot;tamlueng&quot;. The pit means twenty, as in 1/20 of a chang, the other name is ekkang, or one thai tamlueng. The &quot;tot&quot; means ten, as in 1/10 of a &quot;chang&quot;. The coin was also called &quot;thukkang&quot;, which means two &quot;tamlueng&quot;. In the lower denominations materials such as tin, copper and brass are used, since these are quite low value.

According to the Thai Treasury, regarding the gold coins, they were minted during a period when large amounts of gold were entering Thailand. Inspired by the widespread use of gold coins in other countries, such as the gold coins of England, King Mongkut (Rama IV) ordered the production of gold coins for domestic use. These coins, with their higher value, facilitated trade as the silver coins in circulation at the time were of lower value. They were officially issued on October 29, 1863, and were withdrawn from use in 1908.

This series of coins was produced using manually operated machinery that had been presented as a royal gift by Queen Victoria of England. Due to the limited production capacity of these machines, the coins could not be minted in sufficient quantities to meet the country&#x27;s demand. Consequently, their use was discontinued. This coincided with the arrival of steam-powered machinery, which allowed for more efficient and larger-scale coin production. It is worth noting that coins of the half-fuang denomination were not mentioned in official announcements.

In 1866, These thin copper coins, in sik (half-fuang) and siao (quarter-fuang) denominations, were produced to replace their thicker counterparts, which were heavier and had the same value. The decision to issue lighter, thinner coins was made after an incident where King Mongkut (Rama IV) distributed the thicker coins during a charitable event, and recipients were injured with head wounds and bruises. His Majesty considered that the copper coins already bore stamped marks and inscriptions (indicating that 2 coins equaled 1 fuang and 4 coins equaled 1 fuang), making them trustworthy. Therefore, thinner and lighter coins would still serve their purpose effectively without causing harm.
==== Issue 3 - 1875 ====
The first series to depict king Rama V, the coins of this issue were made of copper, silver, and gold. Though gold was strangely only used for the 1 &quot;fueang&quot; denomination. The new shield emblem was introduced in this issue. This shield was separated into three section. Drawing from western influences, symbols within these sections represented territories Siam was controlling. The tree-headed elephant represented Siamese territory, the bottom-left elephant represented Lan Xang, and the warangka represented Siamese Malaya.

Due to a malfunction in the minting machinery at the government mint, which prevented the production of circulating coinage, King Chulalongkorn ordered the design of this coin series and commissioned its production by a mint in Birmingham, England. This marked the first time that coins were minted abroad for circulation in Siam. The copper coins in this issue were made in the same size as the coins of the United Kingdom, with the Solot being the same size as the Farthing, the Att being the same size as the Half-Penny, and the Siao being the same size as the Penny. The silver coins differ in size to the British counterpart due to the baht being pegged to a different unit of silver. The copper coin in this case were base metal and were not pegged to any standard metal, hence their size tend to differ more throughout history. These copper coins only represent a certain amount of silver.

These silver coins were minted when the Sathit Kuang machinery was put into use in 1889 at the Sathit Kuang Coin Mint, marking the beginning of a new coinage system. The year markings started to appear on the coins from R.S. 120 (1898) onwards.
==== Issue 4 - 1888 ====
This was a minor-issue, where the lesser denominations&#x27; designs were updated to incorporate the three-parted shield into the design. This copper coin was produced to replace previous versions and was minted in England, with additional production by the Royal Mint of Thailand. In this issue, depending on where the coin was minted, the minting alignment was different. This means that in this specific series, the alignment will tell which mint the coin is minted at. For example, during this series there were 4 mints which contributed in minting this issue: Royal Mint of Belgium, Bangkok Mint, Heaton and Sons (Burmingham Mint), and Hamburgische Mint. For the 1 Solot coin, the coin minted in the year R.S. 109 were medal aligned and was minted in the Birmingham Mint, and R.S. 118 coins were minted in Hamburg had coin alignement.

=== Decimal coinage ===
The decimalization of the Thai baht came about at the end of the 19th century. The minister of treasury, Jayanta Mongkol, the Prince Mahisara Rajaharudaya, suggested to King Rama V, that decimalization would make counting easier and further modernize Siam. Initially, there would be one superunit, &quot;chang&quot;, and one subunit, &quot;at&quot;. with the baht being in the middle. In summary, 64 &quot;at&quot; = 1 baht = 1/80 &quot;chang&quot;. In reality, this was just a simplification of the old system, which was scrapped. In which, during the period of 1902–1908, Siam went back to the old system. Though in comparison, &quot;at&quot; is used as the subunit in Laos, compared to the satang in the Thai baht. The second attempt came at the end of Rama V&#x27;s reign, where it was more widely accepted and put into effective use.

In 1897, the first coins denominated in satang were introduced, cupronickel , 5, 10, and 20 satang. However, 1 &quot;solot&quot;, 1, and 2 &quot;at&quot; coins were struck until 1905 and 1 &quot;fueang&quot; coins were struck until 1910. In 1908, holed 1, 5, and 10 satang coins were introduced, with the 1 satang in bronze and the 5 and 10 satang in nickel. The 1 and 2 &quot;salueng&quot; were replaced by 25 and 50 satang coins in 1915. In 1937, holed, bronze satang were issued.

In 1941, a series of silver coins was introduced in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 satang, due to a shortage of nickel caused by World War II. The next year, tin coins were introduced for 1, 5, and 10 satang, followed by 20 satang in 1945 and 25 and 50 satang in 1946. In 1950, aluminium bronze 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang were introduced whilst, in 1957, bronze 5 and 10 satang were issued, along with 1-baht coins struck in an unusual alloy of copper, nickel, silver and zinc. Several Thai coins were issued for many years without changing the date. These include the tin 1942 1 satang and the 1950 5 and 10 satang, struck until 1973, the tin 1946 25 satang struck until 1964, the tin 50 satang struck until 1957, and the aluminium bronze 1957 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang struck until the 1970s. Cupronickel 1-baht coins were introduced in 1962 and struck without date change until 1982.

In 1972, cupronickel 5-baht coins were introduced, switching to cupronickel-clad copper in 1977. Between 1986 and 1988, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of aluminium 1, 5 and 10 satang, aluminium bronze 25 and 50 satang, cupronickel 1 baht, cupronickel-clad copper 5 baht and bimetallic 10 baht. Cupronickel-clad steel 2 baht were introduced in 2005.

==== Issue 5 - 1897 (transitional) ====
The old monetary system of Siam was based on a binary system that proved challenging for accounting purposes. This system initially consisted of three main units of currency: Chang, Baht, and Att. Under this system, there were 64 Att to 1 Baht and 80 Baht to 1 Chang. Despite its widespread use, the system’s complexity made it difficult to manage and calculate.

Recognizing the inefficiencies, the Minister of Treasury proposed to King Rama V that Siam’s currency system should be decimalized. The proposal aimed to modernize the monetary system and align it with the decimal systems increasingly adopted by other countries at the time. King Rama V approved the transition to a decimal-based currency, which simplified accounting processes.

The transition to a decimal currency system faced numerous challenges even before the new coins were issued. Notably, the word &quot;Anachak&quot; (อาณาจักร) was initially misspelled as &quot;อานาจักร,&quot; causing controversy. King Rama V intervened, insisting that the most accurate phrasing should be &quot;Siam Ratcha-Anachak&quot; (สยามราชอาณาจักร; Kingdom of Siam).

Despite the initial enthusiasm for the decimal system, the new coins struggled to gain popularity among the public. Many people were unfamiliar with the decimal system and preferred the traditional currency. Consequently, the new coins quickly faded from circulation, forcing the government to continue producing coins under the old system.

The production of coins from the old system persisted until RS 127 / BE 2451 / AD 1907. Ultimately, both pre-decimal coins and the early decimal coins were demonetized on May 17, RS 128 / BE 2452 / AD 1909. Citizens were given a grace period to exchange the demonetized coins for the new decimal currency, with the deadline set for May 16, RS 128 / BE 2452 / AD 1910.

This gradual shift is shown in the fact that coins after the transition often switched between three calendar systems, the CS (Chulasakarat) system, the RS (Rattanakosin Sok) system, the BE (Buddhist Era / Phutthasakarat) system.
==== Issue 6 - 1908, 1913, 1929, 1939 ====
These coins were all produced abroad, and they feature changes in year formatting and design differences over time. The coins were initially produced with the R.S. year system but transitioned to using the B.E. system from 1913 onwards. The 1 Baht coins were replaced with banknotes starting in 1918 due to the high cost of silver. The 2 Salung and 1 Salung coins experienced changes in metal composition due to fluctuating silver prices during World War I, and these coins have slight design variations based on these changes.

During issue, there were also various debasements of the silver content of these coins. Initially, the composition was 80% silver and 20% copper. In 1918, during World War I, silver prices surged, leading to a change in the composition to 65% silver and 35% copper. In 1919, the silver percentage dropped further to 50% silver and 50% copper. After the war, in 1919, the composition returned to 65% silver and 35% copper. In 1917, the price of silver rose and exceeded the face value of silver coins. The coins were then melted down and sold. The government solved this by changing the pure silver coin to alloy. Vajiravudh eventually forbade exports of Siamese coins. In 1918, the usage of 1-baht coins was nullified and 1-baht banknotes were introduced. Coins were recalled and kept as a national reserve. 

Near the end of this issue of coins, the transition into decimal currency was completed. The Rama VII coin was produced in two denominations, 50 Satang and 25 Satang, and marked the transition from the old currency system of &quot;สองสลึง&quot; (two salung) and &quot;หนึ่งสลึง&quot; (one salung) to the new system using Satang as a unit of currency. Though, people today still refer to these denomination using the old terminology.
==== Issue 7 - 1937, 1941, 1942, 1945 ====
This series of coins is distinctive as it lacks the royal insignia or the state seal, which were commonly featured in earlier designs. This series also contain a 20 satang denomination, meaning that there was a time where 25-satang and the 20-satang circulated at the same time. The half-satang was introduced in 1937 to address the issue of low-value currency units in Thailand. The value of 1 Satang was considered too high for certain low-priced items, causing economic hardship for the poor. Previously, 1 Baht could be exchanged for 128 Solot, but after the switch to Satang, 1 Baht was only equivalent to 100 Satang. The introduction of this coin aimed to make it easier for ordinary people to purchase items without the burden of inflated prices. The coin was produced only once and was discontinued soon after. It was minted in Japan and first issued on July 12, 1937. 

In 1942, a bunch of denomination switched material due to the costs of World War 2, the 1-satang coin lost its hole in the middle and was downsized.
==== Issue 8 - 1946 ====
This was the first series minted in the reign of King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), and it marked the return of national symbols, such as the Garuda emblem, which had been used as the national seal since the Ayutthaya period. This emblem, created during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), became the national seal to be used permanently, avoiding the need for a new one with each reign. There are two versions of this series minted in the same year, the young portrait and the teen portrait.

=== Current coinage ===
The current coin series is the 14th issue.

In 2008, in the 13th issue, the Ministry of Finance and the Royal Thai Mint announced the 2009 coin series, which included changes in materials to reduce production costs as well as an update of the image on the obverse to a more recent portrait of the king. The two-baht coin, confusingly similar in color and size to the one-baht coin, was changed from nickel-clad low-carbon steel to aluminium bronze. New two-baht coin was the first of the new series released on 3 February 2009, followed by the satang coins in April, a five-baht coin in May, a ten-baht coin in June, and a one-baht coin in July 2009.

In 2018, the Royal Thai Mint and the Ministry of Finance issued a new series of general circulation coins, featuring the same standard specifications, but feature a portrait of its current king, Vajiralongkorn.

=== Remarks ===
# The 1, 5 and 10 satang are used only internally between banks and are not in circulation.
# Older coins, some of which are still in circulation, had only Thai numerals, but newer designs also have Arabic numerals.
# The standard-issue 10-baht coin has, at the 12 o&#x27;clock position on the reverse, raised dots corresponding to Braille cell dot 1 and dots 2-4-5, which correspond to the number 10.
# 10-baht coins are very similar to 2-euro coins in size, shape and weight, and are likewise bi-metallic, although they are worth only 25 eurocents. Vending machines not equipped with up-to-date coin detectors might therefore accept them as €2 coins or old Italian 500 lira coins as well.
# Many commemorative 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-baht coins have been made for special events. There also are 20-, 50-, 100-baht base metal commemorative coins and higher-denomination precious metal coins as well.

In February 2010 the Treasury Department of Thailand stated that it has been planning a new circulation 20-baht coin.

In 1851, the government issued notes for , , , and 1 tical, followed by 3, 4, 6 and 10 tamlueng in 1853. After 1857, notes for 20 and 40 ticals were issued, also bearing their values in Straits dollars and Indian rupees. Undated notes were also issued before 1868 for 5, 7, 8, 12 and 15 tamlueng, and 1 chang. One at notes were issued in 1874.

In 1892, the treasury issued notes for 1, 5, 10, 40, 80, 100, 400 and 800 ticals, called &quot;baht&quot; in the Thai text.

On 10 September 1902, the government introduced notes which were printed by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company Limited, England, during the reigns of Kings Rama V and Rama VI, denominated 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1000 ticals, still called baht in the Thai text — each denomination having many types, with 1 and 50 tical notes following in 1918. In 1925, notes were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 baht with the denomination in both Arabic and Thai numerals without English text; English speakers continued to refer to these as &quot;ticals&quot;.

On 27 July 2010, the Bank of Thailand announced that the 16th-series banknotes would enter circulation in December 2010. On 9 August 2012, the Bank of Thailand issued a new denomination banknote, 80 baht, to commemorate queen Sirikit&#x27;s 80th birthday. It was the first Thai banknote that featured Crane&#x27;s MOTION security thread.

In 2017, the Bank of Thailand announced a new family of banknotes in remembrance of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). The notes are the same size and dimensions as the &quot;Series 16&quot; banknotes, with the front designs as before, but the back designs featuring images of the king&#x27;s life in infancy, adolescence and maturity. The new family of banknotes were issued on September 20.

In 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced a new family of banknotes featuring a portrait of the current King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X). The main colors and dimensions of the notes are the same as before, with the back designs featuring images of the Kings of Thailand from past to present. The 20, 50 and 100 baht banknotes were issued on Chakri Memorial Day, April 6, 2018. The final two denominations, 500 and 1,000 baht were issued on the anniversary of the birth of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, July 28, 2018.

=== Timeline ===
=== Predecimal banknotes ===
The characteristic of the banknotes of this era was that there were no series issued at the same time, rather they were issued sporadically and had multiple banks producing their own banknotes.

==== 1851–1868, Rama IV era banknotes ====
==== 1868–1902, Rama V era banknotes ====
===== Royal Treasury banknotes =====

==== 1902–1925 (Series 1), Rama V and Rama VI era ====
===== Series 1 =====
Series 1 was chosen due to the series which precedes this were non-decimal. Series 1 banknotes was the first series to be produced by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company Limited. In 1900, Charles James Rivett Carnac, a Royal Treasury Ministry advisor proposed that the Siamese baht followed the issuances of banknotes followed the British standard. The banknote department was established quickly thereafter. The main characteristic of this series was that the notes were one-sided and multilingual, containing Chinese, Malay (in Jawi script), and Latin scripts. It was also the last series to use the term &quot;tical&quot; to refer to the Thai baht and the largest in term of size of the circulated notes.
==== 1925–1935 (Series 2 to Series 3 Type 1), Rama VII era ====
===== Series 2 =====
Series 2 banknotes were produced by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company Limited. 
===== Series 3 Type 1 =====
Series 3 type 1 banknotes were produced by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company Limited. This series was actually delayed due to the Siamese revolution to abolish the absolute monarchy and transform it into a constitutional monarchy. The issuance was supposed to happen in the early 1930s.

===== Series 3 Type 2 =====

===== Series 10 =====
Series 10 banknotes were produced by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company Limited. Due to heavy counterfeiting, series 10 was issued in series 9&#x27;s stead. The 100-baht note is the only denomination issued in this series.
===== Series 11 =====
In this series, the 500-baht note was introduced for the first time ever. This coincided with the Bank of Thailand fully converting to an in-house production. As a consequence, the 1-baht note&#x27;s production was cancelled.
===== Series 12 and 13 =====
Series 12 and 13 aimed to glorify past Thai monarchs, the Bank of Thailand dubbed this as &quot;The Great Series.&quot; The 5-baht note&#x27;s production was cancelled.

==== 2003–present (Series 14 to Series 17), late Rama IX and Rama X era ====
Images of banknotes have been removed lest they infringe copyright, but may be viewed at the Thai-language article linked in the margin.

===== Series 14 =====
The series 14 aims to focus on the activities and contributions of the Chakri kings. Officially, only three notes were issued, but the 50-baht notes were also produced alongside this series. The polymer 50-baht is considered to be a part of series 15, even though the production date began in 1994.
===== Series 15 =====
The series 15 aims to update and expand the previous series 14&#x27;s design. The 1000-baht note was resized down. There are two variants of this series, with the second and later variant having updated security features.
===== Series 16 =====
Similar to the series 15, the series 16 banknotes update the design to include a more later portrait of King Rama IX. There are two variants of this series, the later one being a circulated commemorative series circulating for a year after King Rama IX&#x27;s passing. The series 16-2 notes depict the life and achievements of King Rama IX on the reverse.
===== Series 17 =====
==Money and unit of mass==
&quot;Ngoen&quot; () is Thai for &quot;silver&quot; as well as the general term for money, reflecting the fact that the baht (or tical) is foremost a unit of weight for precious metals and gemstones. One baht = 15.244 grams. Since the standard purity of Thai gold is 96.5 percent, the actual gold content of one baht by weight is 15.244 × 0.965 = 14.71046 grams; equivalent to about 0.473 troy ounces. 15.244 grams is used for bullion; in the case of jewellery, one baht should be more than 15.16 grams.

=== Historical coinage material ===
== Exchange rates ==
The Bank of Thailand adopted a series of exchange controls on 19 December 2006, which resulted in a significant divergence between offshore and onshore exchange rates, with spreads of up to 10 percent between the two markets. Controls were broadly lifted on 3 March 2008 and there is now no significant difference between offshore and onshore exchange rates.

<text>Tarn-et-Garonne (; ) is a department in the Occitania region in Southern France. It is traversed by the rivers Tarn and Garonne, from which it takes its name. The area was originally part of the former provinces of Quercy and Languedoc. The department was created in 1808 under Napoleon, with territory taken from the neighbouring Lot, Haute-Garonne, Lot-et-Garonne, Gers and Aveyron departments.

The department is mostly rural with fertile agricultural land in the broad river valley, but there are hilly areas to the south, east and north. The departmental prefecture is Montauban; the sole subprefecture is Castelsarrasin. In 2019, it had a population of 260,669.

==History==
===History of the region===
Quercy was part of &quot;Aquitania prima&quot; under the Romans; Christianity was introduced during the 4th century. Early in the 6th century the area fell under the authority of the Franks, and in the 7th century became part of the autonomous Duchy of Aquitaine. At the end of the 10th century its rulers were the powerful counts of Toulouse. During the hostilities between England and France in the reign of Henry II of England, the English placed garrisons in the county, and by the 1259 Treaty of Paris lower Quercy came under the control of England.

The kings of both England and France around this time tried to curry favour by adding to the privileges of the towns and the district. In 1360, the Treaty of Brétigny was signed and the whole of Quercy passed to England. However, in the 1440s the English were finally expelled by the newly created army of Charles VII of France. In the 16th century Quercy was a stronghold of the Protestants, and the scene of fierce religious conflicts. The civil wars of the reign of Louis XIII largely took place around Montauban.

After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815, the monarchy was re-established in France, but the discredited Bourbon Dynasty was overthrown in the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy, which lasted until 1848. During this time the divide between the rich and poor increased; in Montauban, hundreds turned to begging as wages fell, factories closed and food prices rose; rioting was widespread and the home of the mayor was stoned by building workers in 1847.

===History of the department===

Before the department&#x27;s formation in the nineteenth century, the northern half formed part of the old province of Quercy and the southern half, part of Languedoc. The department was created on 4 November 1808 during the First French Empire by a decision of Napoleon. The emperor had been invited to visit the town of Montauban, an important industrial and commercial centre at the time, whose populace thought the town was central enough and sufficiently important to be the capital of a new department. He was impressed by their loyalty and granted their request.

The department was formed out of territories that had previously been part of neighbouring areas. More than half of the territory was taken from the Department of Lot (including Montauban and Moissac), over one-third was taken from Haute-Garonne (including Castelsarrasin), and the rest from the departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Gers, and Aveyron. The first prefect was Félix Le Peletier d&#x27;Aunay, who was installed in his post on 31 December 1808.

==Geography==
Tarn-et-Garonne constitutes part of the Occitanie region in Southern France. It borders on the departments of Lot to the north, Aveyron to the northeast, Tarn to the east, Haute-Garonne to the south, and Gers and Lot-et-Garonne to the west. The capital of the department is Montauban which lies about north of Toulouse. Montauban is situated on the right bank of the river Tarn at its confluence with the river Tescou, and the Tarn is joined by the Aveyron about further downstream. The second largest commune in the department is Castelsarrasin which stands near the confluence of the Tarn and River Garonne. Montauban is connected to the Garonne via the Canal de Montech.

The central part of the department is a broad river valley that does not exceed in altitude, but near the commune of Valence-d&#x27;Agen, in the extreme west of the department, the valley narrows as the hilly regions of Bas-Quercy to the north and Lomagne to the south draw closer together. In the northeast of the department is higher land in the form of limestone plateaus known as the Causses, part of the Massif Central. The highest point in the department, at , is the Pech Maurel, situated in the commune of Castanet.

==Demographics==
===Principal towns===
The most populous commune is Montauban, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are seven communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Economy==
The economy of the department depends mainly on agriculture but there is also some industry, and it benefits from its proximity to Toulouse. The commercial importance of Montauban is mainly due to its trade in agricultural products, horses, game and poultry, but it does have some manufacturing industries, which include cloth-weaving, cloth-dressing, flour-milling, wood-sawing, and the manufacture of furniture, silk-gauze and straw hats. The surrounding countryside supports nursery-gardening, wine-making and the growing of maize, olives and mulberries. This area is approximately at the northern limit for the commercial production of the latter two crops because of the vagaries of the climate.

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Tarn-et-Garonne===
The Departmental Council of Tarn-et-Garonne has 30 seats. The president of the Departmental Council is Michel Weill, elected in July 2021.

===Members of the National Assembly===
Tarn-et-Garonne elected the following members of the National Assembly during the 2022 legislative election:

<text>Ann Macbeth (25 September 1875 – 23 March 1948) was a British embroiderer, designer, teacher and author. She was a member of the Glasgow Movement where she was an associate of Margaret MacDonald and Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and many other &#x27;Glasgow Girls&#x27;. She was also an active suffragette and designed banners for organisations supporting women’s suffrage, such as the Women’s Social and Political Union

== Early life ==
Macbeth was born in the Bolton suburb of Halliwell, and studied at the Glasgow School of Art. When Macbeth was a child, she had a scarlet fever attack. She was the eldest of nine children. Her father was Norman Macbeth, a mechanical engineer, and her mother was Annie MacNicol.

She came from an artistic background: her uncles included the artists Robert Walker Macbeth and Henry Macbeth-Raeburn and her paternal grandfather was the portraitist Norman Macbeth. In 1902, she participated in the &#x27;Scottish Section&#x27; of the &quot;First International Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art&quot; in Turin where she won a silver medal for the design of the Glasgow Coat of Arms on one side of the banner presented to Professor Rucker of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

== Teaching ==

After completing her studies at the Glasgow School of Art in 1901 Macbeth became assistant to Jessie Newbery and her striking embroidery work was given regular coverage in &quot;The Studio&quot;. In 1906 she started teaching metalwork at the Glasgow School of Art. There she also taught bookbinding from 1907 to 1911, and ceramic decoration from 1912 onwards.

From roughly 1902 to 1911, the needlework department was the largest of the craft sections at the Glasgow School of Art. There was a requirement that all Glasgow schoolgirls should be taught to sew. Work constructed by Newberry, Macbeth, and their students was of two main types: the bold, appliquéd, patterned style inspired by nature and found on practical items, or the more conventional aesthetic consisting of picture panels, which were found on fire screens or ecclesiastical hangings. Newberry might have been the bolder of the two designers, although Macbeth embroidered panels more extensively with expressive stitching. These embroidered panels featured young girls with garlands or girls set within a landscape, similar to the stained glass pieces of the period.

In 1908 she succeeded Jessie Newbery as Head of the Needlework and Embroidery section at the Glasgow School of Art, and in 1912 she became the Director of Studies in the Needlework-Decorative Arts Studio. In 1911 she took part in the planning for the Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry, sitting on the committee of the Decorative and Fine Arts Section.

Together with the educational psychologist Margaret Swanson Macbeth published the textbook &quot;Educational Needlecraft&quot; in 1911. The textbook won international acclaim and widely influenced the teaching of needlecraft. It remained on the Scottish school syllabus until the 1950s.
The embroidery classes at the Glasgow School of Art were open to the community as a whole. Saturday classes for schoolteachers led to a certificate by the Scottish Education Department. In her teaching and publications Macbeth spread the radical approach to design of the Glasgow Movement and put into practice the ideas of the Arts and Crafts movement. She elevated the status of home dressmaking and encouraged women to create their own individualistic clothing. She brought designed dresses within reach of women with modest means by advocating the use of &quot;humble materials&quot; such as cotton, linen and crash. In her publications Macbeth encouraged a new generation of designer-craftswomen, discouraging copying of patterns.

The use of these humble materials separated her from artisans of the Morris circle, who used rich silks. Macbeth considered the silks and satins most popular with the previous generation of art-embroiderers to not only be more costly, but ‘really less artistic’.

From 1920 onwards Macbeth also taught handicrafts at the Women&#x27;s Institute and participated in programmes to alleviate local economic hardship. In her book &quot;Embroidered and Laced Leatherwork&quot; Macbeth lamented that women produced crafts in their spare time and devalued their work by undercharging for it so that barely the cost of the materials was covered. Through her teaching work at the Women&#x27;s Institute Macbeth aimed to generate a means of livelihood for craftworkers by creating regional styles of work.

== Women&#x27;s suffrage activism ==
Macbeth designed the banner for the 1908 Edinburgh march of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies. In October 1909 the Glasgow branch of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, the militant wing of the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United Kingdom, was presented with an embroidered banner designed by Macbeth. For a 1910 exhibition Macbeth designed the WSPU Holloway Prisoners Banner a linen quilt with the embroidered signatures of the 80 suffragette hunger strikers. It was subsequently used as a banner.
Aside from working as a suffrage banner maker Macbeth was also a member of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union and she engaged in militant action. As a result, she was imprisoned although, as she does not appear in court or newspaper reports, she appears to have done so under a false name; the nature of her action is unknown. In a letter to the Secretary of the Glasgow School of Arts from May 1912 Macbeth thanked him for his &quot;kind letters&quot; and wrote &quot;I am still very much less vigorous than I anticipated... after a fortnight&#x27;s solitary imprisonment with forcible feedings&quot;. After the 1912 prison stay she needed several months care as a &quot;semi-invalid&quot;.

The School&#x27;s Governors were extremely supportive of Macbeth during her time of recovery. Macbeth was given “every consideration until well enough to return to work.” This level of commitment highlighted a tacit approbation of artists advocating for the suffrage cause from the School&#x27;s Governors.

== Artistic output ==

Macbeth became a renowned embroider and designer. Her prolific output included bookbindings, metalwork and designs for carpet manufacturers Alexander Morton and Co., Donald Bros. of Dundee, and Liberty&#x27;s &amp; Knox&#x27;s Linen Thread Company. For Liberty, Macbeth also provided Art Nouveau-style embroidery designs that featured in the firm&#x27;s mail order catalogues until the outbreak of the First World War. Her designs were sold by Liberty as iron-on transfers for the embroidery of dresses and furniture.

In 1920 Macbeth moved to Patterdale in Westmorland, Cumbria. She remained a visiting lecturer at the Glasgow School of Arts until her retirement in 1928. In Patterdale she continued to produce needleworks, often large decorative designs, and produced church hangings and vestments. She also decorated china and fired her own china in a kiln she had built herself. She devised a simple method of rug-weaving which was published in her book &quot;Country Woman’s Rug&quot; in 1929. She argued that machines would democratise design and that craftworkers who understood the workings of machines could achieve high artistic quality. In the summers Macbeth lived on a crag in Helvelly in a self-designed house and captured the local hillsides in embroidery. Outside the house she dyed her own yarn in pits.

== Publicly accessible works ==

St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Patterdale, Cumbria houses some of her embroideries.
Examples of her work were on exhibition at Miss Cranston&#x27;s tea-rooms in Glasgow over a long period. She designed and embroidered a frontal for the communion table of Glasgow Cathedral.

A range of her work, both in embroidery and in ceramics, was on display in Kelvingrove Museum in its exhibition &quot;Making the Glasgow Style&quot; from 30 March to 14 August 2018.

&quot;The Studio&quot; contains many images of her work.

== Publications ==
Macbeth published six books on embroidery: &quot;Educational Needlecraft&quot; (first published in 1911, with Margaret Swanson), &quot;The Playwork Book&quot; (first published 1918), &quot;School and Fireside Crafts&quot; (first published 1920 with May Spence), &quot;The Country Woman&#x27;s Rug Book&quot; (first published 1921), &quot;Needleweaving&quot; (first published 1922), and &quot;Embroidered Lace and Leatherwork&quot; (first published 1924). She also produced several designs for jewellery some of which appear as illustrations in books by Peter Wylie Davidson.

<text>The British Invasion was a cultural phenomenon of the mid-1960s, when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom and other aspects of British culture became popular in the United States with significant influence on the rising &quot;counterculture&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. British pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Bee Gees, Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Who, the Kinks, the Zombies, Small Faces, the Dave Clark Five, the Spencer Davis Group, the Yardbirds, Them, Manfred Mann, the Searchers, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Queen, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Hollies, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Chad and Jeremy, Peter and Gordon, the Animals, the Moody Blues, the Mindbenders, the Troggs, Cream, Traffic, the Pretty Things, Pink Floyd, and Procol Harum, as well as solo singers such as Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black, Petula Clark, Tom Jones, Donovan, and Marianne Faithfull were at the forefront of the &quot;invasion.&quot;

== Background ==
The rebellious tone and image of American rock and roll and blues musicians became popular with British youth in the late 1950s. While early commercial attempts to replicate American rock and roll mostly failed, the trad jazz–inspired skiffle craze, with its do-it-yourself attitude, produced two top-ten hits in the US by Lonnie Donegan. Young British groups started to combine various British and American styles in different parts of the United Kingdom, such as the movement in Liverpool known as Merseybeat or the &quot;beat boom&quot;.

While American acts were popular in the United Kingdom, few British acts had achieved any success in the United States prior to 1964. Cliff Richard, who was the best-selling British act in the United Kingdom at the time, had only one Top 40 hit in the US, with &quot;Living Doll&quot; in 1959. Along with Donegan, exceptions to this trend were the US number-one hits &quot;Auf Wiederseh&#x27;n, Sweetheart&quot; by Vera Lynn in 1952 (Lynn also had a lower-charting, but more enduring, hit in &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot;), &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot; by Laurie London in 1958, and the instrumentals &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; by Acker Bilk and &quot;Telstar&quot; by the Tornados, both in 1962. Also on the Hot 100, &quot;Manhattan Spiritual&quot; by Reg Owen and His Orchestra&quot; reached number ten in February 1959, Hayley Mills&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; from &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; peaked number eight in October 1961, and in 1962, &quot;Midnight in Moscow&quot; by Kenny Ball reached number two in March, the Springfields&#x27; version of &quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot; peaked at number twenty in September, and Frank Ifield&#x27;s &quot;I Remember You&quot; reached number five in October.

Some observers have noted that American teenagers were growing tired of singles-oriented pop acts like Fabian and the &quot;Bobby&quot;s: Bobby Darin, Bobby Vinton, Bobby Rydell, Bobby Vee etc. The Mods and Rockers, two youth &quot;gangs&quot; in mid-1960s Britain, also had an impact in British Invasion music. Bands with a Mod aesthetic became the most popular, but bands able to balance both (e.g., the Beatles) were also successful.

== Beatlemania ==


In October 1963, the first newspaper articles about the frenzy in England surrounding the Beatles appeared nationally in the US. The Beatles&#x27; 4 November Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen Mother sparked music industry and media interest in the group. During November, a number of major American print outlets and two network television evening programs published and broadcast stories on the phenomenon that became known as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;.

On 10 December, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Walter Cronkite, looking for something positive to report, re-ran a Beatlemania story that originally aired on the 22 November edition of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; with Mike Wallace but was shelved that night because of the assassination of US President John Kennedy. After seeing the report, 15-year-old Marsha Albert of Silver Spring, Maryland, wrote a letter the following day to disc jockey Carroll James at radio station WWDC asking, &quot;Why can&#x27;t we have music like that here in America?&quot; On 17 December, James had Miss Albert introduce &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; live on the air. WWDC&#x27;s phones lit up, and Washington, D.C., area record stores were flooded with requests for a record they did not have in stock. James sent the record to other disc jockeys around the country, sparking similar reaction. On 26 December, Capitol Records released the record three weeks ahead of schedule. The release of the record during a time when teenagers were on vacation helped spread Beatlemania in the US. On 29 December, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, reflecting the dismissive view of most adults, editorialised, &quot;America had better take thought as to how it will deal with the invasion. Indeed a restrained &#x27;Beatles go home&#x27; might be just the thing.&quot; In the next year alone, the Beatles would have thirty different listings on the Hot 100.

On 3 January 1964, &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot; ran Beatles concert footage licensed from the BBC &quot;as a joke&quot;, but it was watched by 30 million viewers. While this piece was largely forgotten, Beatles producer George Martin has said it &quot;aroused the kids&#x27; curiosity&quot;. In the middle of January 1964, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; appeared suddenly, then vaulted to the top of nearly every top forty music survey in the US, launching the Fab Four&#x27;s sustained, massive output. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; ascended to number one on the 25 January 1964 edition of &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine (on sale January 18) and the 1 February 1964 edition of the Hot 100. On 7 February 1964, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; ran a story about the Beatles&#x27; US arrival that afternoon, of which Walter Cronkite said, &quot;The British Invasion this time goes by the code name Beatlemania.&quot; Two days later, on Sunday, 9 February, the group appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Nielsen Ratings estimated that 45 percent of American television viewers that night saw their appearance.

According to Michael Ross, &quot;It is somewhat ironic that the biggest moment in the history of popular music was first experienced in the US as a television event.&quot; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; had for some time been a &quot;comfortable hearth-and-slippers experience.&quot; Not many of the 73 million viewers watching in February 1964 would fully understand what impact the band they were watching would have.
The Beatles soon incited contrasting reactions and, in the process, generated more novelty records than anyone — at least 200 during 1964–1965 and more inspired by the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; rumour in 1969. Among the many reactions favouring the hysteria were British girl group the Carefrees&#x27; &quot;We Love You Beatles&quot; (No. 39 on 11 April 1964) and the Patty Cakes&#x27; &quot;I Understand Them&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Love Song to the Beatles&quot;. Disapproving of the pandemonium were US group the Four Preps&#x27; &quot;A Letter to the Beatles&quot; (No. 85 on 4 April 1964) and US comedian Allan Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Pop Hates the Beatles&quot;.

The Beatles held number 1 for a then-record fourteen straight weeks, from 1 February through 2 May, but performed even better on &quot;Cash Box&quot;, holding number 1 for sixteen straight weeks, from 25 January, the week before, through 9 May, the week after. On 4 April, the Beatles held the top five positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart; no other act had simultaneously held even the top four. The Beatles also held the top five positions on &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s singles chart that same week, with the first two positions reversed from the Hot 100. The group&#x27;s massive chart success, which included at least two of their singles holding the top spot on the Hot 100 during each of the seven consecutive years starting with 1964, continued until they broke up in 1970.

== Beyond the Beatles ==
One week after the Beatles entered the Hot 100 for the first time, Dusty Springfield, having launched a solo career after her participation in the Springfields, became the next British act to reach the Hot 100, peaking at number twelve with &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;. During the next three years, many more British acts with a chart-topping US single would appear. As 1965 approached, another wave of British Invasion artists emerged. These were usually composed of groups playing in a more pop style, such as the Hollies or the Zombies, as well as artists with a harder-driving, blues-based approach like the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones. By 17 April, British acts accounted for 30 records in the Hot 100, and on 8 May, they accounted for eight of the nine British Commonwealth&#x27;s entries that made a nearly clean sweep of that weekly Hot 100&#x27;s Top Ten, lacking only a hit at number two instead of Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys&#x27; &quot;Count Me In&quot;. On 1 May, the British Commonwealth also nearly swept the &quot;Cash Box&quot; singles chart&#x27;s Top Ten, lacking only a hit at number six instead of &quot;Count Me In&quot;. The British Commonwealth also held down the top six on the Hot 100 on 1 May and the top six on &quot;Cash Box&quot; singles chart&#x27;s Top Ten on 24 April. That same year, half of the 26 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart toppers (counting the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, carrying over from 1964) and the number one position on 28 of the 52 chart weeks belonged to British acts. The British trend would continue into 1966 and beyond. British Invasion acts also dominated the music charts at home in the United Kingdom.

The musical style of British Invasion artists, such as the Beatles, had been influenced by earlier American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, a genre that had lost some popularity and appeal by the time of the Invasion. However, a subsequent handful of British performers, particularly the Rolling Stones and the Animals, would appeal to a more &#x27;outsider&#x27; demographic, essentially reviving and popularising, for young people at least, a musical genre rooted in the blues, rhythm, and black culture, which had been largely ignored or rejected when performed by black American artists in the 1950s. Such bands were sometimes perceived by American parents and elders as rebellious and unwholesome, unlike parent-friendly pop groups such as the Beatles. The Rolling Stones would become the biggest band other than the Beatles to come out of the British Invasion, topping the Hot 100 eight times. Sometimes, there would be a clash between the two styles of the British Invasion, the polished pop acts and the grittier blues-based acts, due to the expectations set by the Beatles. Eric Burdon of the Animals said, &quot;They dressed us up in the most strange costumes. They were even gonna bring a choreographer to show us how to move on stage. I mean, it was ridiculous. It was something that was so far away from our nature and, um, yeah we were just pushed around and told, &#x27;When you arrive in America, don&#x27;t mention the [Vietnam] war! You can&#x27;t talk about the war.&#x27; We felt like we were being gagged.&quot;

&quot;Freakbeat&quot; is a term sometimes given to certain British Invasion acts closely associated with the Mod scene during the Swinging London period, particularly harder-driving British blues bands of the era that often remained obscure to American listeners, and who are sometimes seen as counterparts to the garage rock bands in America. Certain acts, such as the Pretty Things and the Creation, had a certain degree of chart success in the UK and are often considered exemplars of the form. The emergence of a relatively homogeneous worldwide &quot;rock&quot; music style marking the end of the &quot;invasion&quot; occurred in 1967.

== Other cultural impacts ==
Outside of music, other aspects of British arts and engineering, such as BSA motorcycles, became popular in the US during this period and led American media to proclaim the United Kingdom as the center of music and fashion.

=== Film and television ===
The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; marked the group&#x27;s entrance into film. The film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; – starring English actress Julie Andrews as the titular character, and released on 27 August 1964 – became the most Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated Disney film in history. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, released on 25 December 1964, starring British actress Audrey Hepburn as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle, won eight Academy Awards. and &quot;Oliver!&quot; released in 1968, won Best Picture, becoming the final musical film to do so until &quot;Chicago&quot; in 2002.

Besides the Bond series that commenced with Sean Connery as James Bond in 1962, films with a British sensibility such as the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot; genre, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; and &quot;Alfie&quot; styled London Theatre. A new wave of British actors such as Peter O&#x27;Toole, Michael Caine, and Peter Sellers intrigued US audiences. Four of the decade&#x27;s Academy Award winners for best picture were British productions, with the epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, starring O&#x27;Toole as British army officer T. E. Lawrence, winning seven Oscars in 1963.

British television series such as &quot;Danger Man&quot; (renamed &quot;Secret Agent&quot; in its American airings), &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; began appearing on American screens, inspiring a series of American-produced espionage programs such as &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and the parody series &quot;Get Smart&quot;. By 1966, spy series (both British and American versions) had emerged as a favourite format of American viewers, along with Westerns and rural sitcoms. Television shows that featured uniquely American styles of music, such as &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; and &quot;Hootenanny&quot;, were quickly canceled and replaced with shows such as &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; that were better positioned to play the new British hits, and segments of the new shows were taped in England.

=== Fashion ===
Fashion and image set the Beatles apart from their earlier American rock and roll counterparts. Their distinctive, uniform style &quot;challenged the clothing style of conventional American males,&quot; just as their music challenged the earlier conventions of the rock and roll genre. &quot;Mod&quot; fashions, such as the miniskirt from &quot;Swinging London&quot; designers such as Mary Quant, and worn by early supermodels Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton and other models, were popular worldwide. Newspaper columnist John Crosby wrote, &quot;The English girl has an enthusiasm that American men find utterly captivating. I&#x27;d like to import the whole Chelsea girl with her &#x27;life is fabulous&#x27; philosophy to America with instructions to bore from within.&quot;

Even while longstanding styles remained popular, American teens and young adults started to dress &quot;hipper&quot;.

=== Literature ===
In anticipation of the 50-year anniversary of the British Invasion in 2013, comics such as &quot;Nowhere Men&quot;, which are loosely based on the events of it, gained popularity.

== Impact on American music ==

The British Invasion had a profound impact on popular music, internationalising the production of rock and roll, establishing the British popular music industry as a viable centre of musical creativity, and opening the door for subsequent British performers to achieve international success. In America, the Invasion arguably spelled the end of the popularity of instrumental surf music, pre-Motown vocal girl groups, the folk revival (which adapted by evolving into folk rock), teenage tragedy songs, Nashville country music (which also faced its own crisis with the deaths of some of its biggest stars at the same time), and temporarily, the teen idols that had dominated the United States charts in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It dented the careers of established R&amp;B acts like Chubby Checker and temporarily derailed the chart success of certain surviving rock and roll acts, including Ricky Nelson, Fats Domino, the Everly Brothers, and Elvis Presley (who nevertheless racked up thirty Hot 100 entries from 1964 through 1967). It prompted many existing garage rock bands to adopt a sound with a British Invasion inflection and inspired many other groups to form, creating a scene from which many major US acts of the next decade would emerge. The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based around guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters.

In February 2021, Ken Barnes, a former &quot;USA Today&quot; radio writer, analysed US musical acts&#x27; success before and during the Invasion in an article for &quot;Radio Insight&quot; attempting to confirm or debunk the claim that the British Invasion devastated US music. In his analysis, he noted that several of the acts whose careers were eclipsed by the Invasion—among them Bobby Vee, Neil Sedaka, Dion and Elvis Presley—eventually made comebacks after the Invasion waned. Others, such as Bill Anderson and Bobby Bare, remained successful in the country realm, even as their pop crossover success had waned. Barnes noted that one record company, Cameo Parkway, sustained more permanent damage from the Invasion (and the concurrent rise of Motown) than any other, but also noted that it was also affected by another event that happened the same week as the Beatles&#x27; arrival: &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, which had been based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where Cameo Parkway was based and drew many of its performers from Cameo Parkway, moved to Los Angeles. In summation, he noted that a plurality of the alleged victims of the Invasion (42 percent of most US hit music acts of 1963) were already seeing diminishing returns in 1963 before the Invasion began; 24 percent of US acts that year saw their success continue through the invasion, such as the Beach Boys and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons; 14 percent were the likes of Sedaka, Vee and Presley in that they suffered during the Invasion but recovered afterward; and 20 percent suffered fatal damage to their careers because of it (with Barnes stating that 7 percent of US acts—mostly Cameo Parkway acts and folk revival groups—were wiped out almost entirely due to the Invasion, and the other 13 percent had the Invasion as one of several reasons for their declines). Stylistically, the proportions of US music being made did not change substantially during the Invasion, even as the British acts flooded the charts with a homogenous pop-rock sound; folk, country and novelty music, already small factors in the overall pop realm, dropped to near-nonexistence, while girl groups were also hard hit.

Though many of the acts associated with the invasion did not survive its end, many others would become icons of rock music. The claim that British beat bands were not radically different from American groups like the Beach Boys and damaged the careers of black American and female artists was made about the invasion. However, the Motown sound, exemplified by the Supremes, the Temptations, and the Four Tops, each securing their first top 20 record during the invasion&#x27;s first year of 1964 and following up with many other top 20 records, besides the constant or even accelerating output of the Miracles, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Marvin Gaye, Martha &amp; the Vandellas, and Stevie Wonder, actually increased in popularity during that time.

Other American groups also demonstrated a similar sound to the British Invasion artists and in turn highlighted how the British &quot;sound&quot; was not in itself a wholly new or original one. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, for example, acknowledged the debt that US artists owed to British musicians, such as the Searchers, but that &quot;they were using folk music licks that I was using anyway. So it&#x27;s not that big a rip-off.&quot; Both the US sunshine pop group the Buckinghams and the Beatles-influenced US Tex-Mex act the Sir Douglas Quintet adopted British-sounding names, and San Francisco&#x27;s Beau Brummels took their name from the same-named English dandy. Roger Miller had a 1965 hit record with a self-penned song titled &quot;England Swings&quot;, in which although its title references the progressive youth-centric cultural scene known as Swinging London, its lyric pays tribute to Britain&#x27;s traditional way of life. Englishman Geoff Stephens (or John Carter) reciprocated the gesture a la Rudy Vallée a year later in the New Vaudeville Band&#x27;s &quot;Winchester Cathedral&quot;. Even as recently as 2003, &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; made the latter two tunes memorable once again in London scenes. Anticipating the Bay City Rollers by more than a decade, two British acts that reached the Hot 100&#x27;s top twenty gave a tip of the hat to America: Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas and the Nashville Teens. The British Invasion also drew a backlash from some US bands, e.g., Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and New Colony Six dressed in Revolutionary War uniforms, and Gary Puckett &amp; the Union Gap donned Civil War uniforms. Garage rock act the Barbarians&#x27; &quot;Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl&quot; contained the lyrics &quot;You&#x27;re either a girl, or you come from Liverpool&quot; and &quot;You can dance like a female monkey, but you swim like a stone, Yeah, a Rolling Stone.&quot;

In Australia, the success of the Seekers and the Easybeats (the latter a band formed mostly of British emigrants) closely paralleled that of the British Invasion. The Seekers had two Hot 100 top five hits during the British Invasion, the number-four hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Find Another You&quot; (recorded at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios) in May 1965 and the number-two hit &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; in February 1967. The Easybeats drew heavily on the British Invasion sound and had one hit in the US during the British Invasion, the number-sixteen hit &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot; in May 1967.

According to Robert J. Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, the British invasion pushed the counterculture into the mainstream.

==End of the first British Invasion and its aftermath==
The historical conclusion of the British Invasion is ambiguous. The wave of Anglophilia largely faded as US culture shifted in response to the Vietnam War and the resulting civil unrest in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the cultural aspects of the British Invasion waned, British musical acts retained their popularity throughout the decade and into the 1970s, competing with their US counterparts as they returned to prominence. British progressive rock acts of the 1970s were often more popular in the US than their native Britain, as the US working class was generally favourable to the virtuosity of progressive rock acts, while the bands&#x27; British audience was confined to the more genteel upper classes.

British bands such as Badfinger and The Sweet, and US band the Raspberries, are considered to have evolved the genre into power pop. In 1978, two rock magazines wrote cover stories analyzing power pop as a saviour to both the new wave and the direct simplicity of rock. Along with the music, new wave power impacted fashion, such as the mod style of the Jam or the skinny ties of the burgeoning Los Angeles scene. Several power pop artists were commercially successful; most notably the Knack, whose &quot;My Sharona&quot; was the highest-ranked US single of 1979. Although the Knack and power pop fell out of mainstream popularity, the genre continues to have a cult following with occasional periods of modest success.

A subsequent wave of British artists rose to popularity in the early 1980s as British music videos appeared in American media, leading to what is now known as the &quot;Second British Invasion&quot;. Another wave of British mainstream prominence in US music charts came in the mid-1990s with the brief success of Spice Girls, Oasis, Blur, Radiohead and Robbie Williams. At least one British act would appear somewhere on the Hot 100 every week from 2 November 1963 until 20 April 2002, originating with the debut of the Caravelles&#x27; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Baby to Cry&quot;. British acts declined in popularity throughout the 1990s, and in the 27 April 2002 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, none of the songs on the Hot 100 were from British artists; that week, only two of the top 100 albums, those of Craig David and Ozzy Osbourne, were from British artists.

The latest movement came in the mid- to late 2000s, when British R&amp;B and soul artists such as Amy Winehouse, Estelle, Joss Stone, Duffy, Natasha Bedingfield, Florence Welch, Adele, Floetry, Jessie J, Leona Lewis, Jay Sean and Taio Cruz enjoyed huge success in the US charts, which led to talk of a &quot;Third British Invasion&quot; or a &quot;British Soul Invasion&quot;. Boyband One Direction have also been described as being a major part of a new &quot;British Invasion&quot; due to them being the first British band to have their debut album at number one on the US charts along with their overall dominance in America.

<text>The AIDS epidemic, caused by HIV, found its way to the United States between the 1970s and 1980s, but was first noticed after doctors discovered clusters of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia in homosexual men in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco in 1981. Treatment of HIV/AIDS is primarily via the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs, and education programs to help people avoid infection.

Initially, infected foreign nationals were turned back at the United States border to help prevent additional infections. The number of United States deaths from AIDS has declined sharply since the early years of the disease&#x27;s presentation domestically. In the United States in 2016, 1.1 million people aged over 13 lived with an HIV infection, of whom 14% were unaware of their infection. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, homosexual and bisexual men, and intravenous drug users remain the most disproportionately affected populations in the United States.

== Mortality and morbidity ==
, about 700,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the United States since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and nearly 13,000 people with AIDS in the United States die each year.

With improved treatments and better prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, death rates have significantly declined.

The overall death rate among persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in New York City decreased by sixty-two percent from 2001 to 2012.

== Containment ==
After the HIV/AIDS outbreak in the 1980s, various responses emerged in an effort to alleviate the issue. These included new medical treatments, travel restrictions, and new public health policies in the United States.

=== Medical treatment ===

Great progress was made in the U.S. following the introduction of three-drug anti-HIV treatments (&quot;cocktails&quot;) that included antiretroviral drugs. David Ho, a pioneer of this approach, was honored as &quot;Time&quot; magazine Man of the Year for 1996. Deaths were rapidly reduced by more than half, with a small but welcome reduction in the yearly rate of new HIV infections. Since this time, AIDS deaths have continued to decline, but much more slowly, and not as completely in African Americans as in other population segments.

=== Travel restrictions ===
In 1987, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) included HIV in its list of &quot;communicable diseases of public health significance,&quot; denying immigrants and short term foreign visits from anyone who tested positive for the virus. In 1993, the US Congress passed the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, removing the HHS&#x27; authority to dictate HIV as a &quot;public health significance,&quot; and explicitly including HIV as a cause for denying immigrants and foreign visitors entry into the US. Anyone seeking US citizenship during the HIV ban was required to undergo a medical exam during the legalization process - testing positive would permanently deny the applicant entry into the country. The law extended to include medication, where foreign travelers could be arrested for having antiretroviral drugs in their carry-on luggage. A famous example was in 1989, when a Dutch traveler to Minnesota was arrested for &quot;several days&quot; because he was carrying AZT in his luggage.

During the turn of the 21st century, people who were HIV positive and seeking temporary visas or vacationing to the US had to avoid revealing their status on application forms, and either plan for their medication to be sent to the US or stop taking their medication. Eventually the US began offering temporary admission waivers for people who were HIV positive. As stated in an interoffice memorandum in 2004, foreign nationals who were HIV positive could qualify for the waiver for either humanitarian/public interest reasons, or being &quot;attendees of certain designated international events held in the United States&quot;.

In early December 2006, President George W. Bush indicated that he would issue an executive order allowing HIV positive people to enter the United States on standard visas. It was unclear whether applicants would still have to declare their HIV status.

In August 2007, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California introduced , the HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007. This bill allowed travelers and immigrants entry to the United States without having to disclose their HIV status. The bill died at the end of the 110th Congress.

In July 2008, President George W. Bush signed that lifted the ban in statutory law. However, the United States Department of Health and Human Services still held the ban in administrative (written regulation) law. New impetus was added to repeal efforts when Paul Thorn, a UK tuberculosis expert who was invited to speak at the 2009 Pacific Health Summit in Seattle, was denied a visa due to his HIV positive status. A letter written by Mr. Thorn, and read in his place at the Summit, was obtained by Congressman Jim McDermott, who advocated the issue to the Obama administration&#x27;s Health Secretary.

On October 30, 2009, President Barack Obama reauthorized the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Bill which expanded care and treatment through federal funding to nearly half a million. The Department of Health and Human Services also crafted regulation that would end the HIV Travel and Immigration Ban, effective in January 2010. On January 4, 2010, the United States Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed HIV infection from the list of &quot;communicable diseases of public health significance,&quot; due to its not being spread by casual contact, air, food or water, and removed HIV status as a factor to be considered in the granting of travel visas, disallowing HIV status from among the diseases that could prevent people who were not U.S. citizens from entering the country.

=== Public health policies ===

Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, several U.S. presidents have attempted to implement a national plan to control the issue. In 1987, Ronald Reagan created a Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic. This commission was recruited to investigate what steps are necessary for responding to the HIV/AIDS outbreak in the country, and the consensus was to establish more HIV testing, focus on prevention and treatment as well as expanding HIV care throughout the United States. However, these changes were not implemented during this time, and the commission recommendations were largely ignored.

Another attempt to respond to the HIV/AIDS outbreak took place in 1996, when Bill Clinton established the National AIDS Strategy, which aimed to reduce the number of infections, enhance research on HIV treatment, increase access to resources for people affected by AIDS, and also alleviate the racial disparities in HIV treatment and care. In Vancouver, the 11th International AIDS Conference highlighted the effectiveness highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), thus creating a new period of optimism. 1996 would mark the first year since the beginning of the epidemic that the number of new HIV/AIDS cases would decline. AIDS was now no longer the leading cause of death in Americans aged 25-44, although it remained the leading cause of death for African Americans in this age group. The AIDS Memorial Quilt would be displayed in its entirety for the last time on the National Mall in October 1996. 1997 would mark the first time that the number of AIDS-related deaths would substantially decline, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting a 47% decline in AIDS-related deaths compared to the previous year. The effectiveness of drug therapy such as HAART would be credited for this significant decline in new cases and deaths.

In 2010, Barack Obama created the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States (NHAS), with its three main objectives being to reduce the annual number of HIV infections, reduce health disparities, and increase access to resources and HIV care. However, this new strategy differs in that it includes an Implementation Plan, with a timeline for achieving each of the three goals, as well as a document outlining the specific action plan that will be used.

In 2019, Donald Trump announced a plan in his State of the Union Address to stop new HIV infections in the United States by 2030, though critics pointed to the President&#x27;s policies reducing access to health insurance, anti-immigrant and anti-transgender policies as undermining this goal. The Department of Health and Human Services issued grants to 32 HIV &quot;hotspots&quot; in 2019, and Congress earmarked over $291 million for the president&#x27;s plan in FY2020.

In February 2019, U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema issued an temporary order barring the U.S. military for discharging or denying officer commissions to personnel based on HIV status. Judge Brinkema&#x27;s order became permanent in April 2022.

=== Localized efforts ===

Local health educators found it upon themselves to promote modes of safe sex amongst gay men, bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1987, Les Pappas, an educator from the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF), spoke at a conference encouraging gay and bisexual men to use condoms during sexual intercourse. In Pappas&#x27; speech, he takes it as the community&#x27;s responsibility to educate men on using condoms, alluding to the degree of educating gay men as if they had no idea how to use condoms or were even aware of the existence of condoms at all.

Pappas saw opening the eyes of the gay community to condoms would create a successful economic &quot;gay market&quot; that was unprecedented for the San Francisco Bay Area. Where he saw bringing attention to buying and using condoms, Pappas also believed that seeing condom paraphernalia would make gay men embrace their sexuality more, thus practicing safer sex.

== Public perception ==


During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, LGBTQ+ communities were further stigmatized as they became the focus of mass hysteria, suffered isolation and marginalization, and were targeted with extreme acts of violence in the United States. One of the best known works on the history of HIV/AIDS is the 1987 book &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; by Randy Shilts, which contends that Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to spread further and infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) by Larry Kramer. Galvanized by the U.S. federal government&#x27;s inactivity, the movement led by AIDS activists to gain funding for HIV/AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.

An early theory asserted that a series of inoculations against hepatitis B that were performed in the gay community of San Francisco were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that vaccination and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. However, the theory has never been officially proven or disproven. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.

Publicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a &quot;gay plague&quot;. These included the Ryan White case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the 1993 film version of &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, sex education programs in schools, and television advertisements. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor Rock Hudson, basketball star Magic Johnson, tennis player Arthur Ashe and singer Freddie Mercury) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.

== Perspective of doctors ==

The global spread of HIV/AIDS was met with great fear and concern by the American population in the 1980s, much like any other epidemic, and those who were primarily affected were African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, homosexual and bisexual men, and intravenous drug users. During the early years of the epidemic, doctors began to not treat patients affected with HIV/AIDS, not only to create distance from these groups of people, but also because they were afraid to contract the disease themselves. At the time, a surgeon in Milwaukee stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to be selfish. It&#x27;s an incurable disease that&#x27;s uniformly fatal, and I&#x27;m constantly at risk for getting it. I&#x27;ve got to think about myself. I&#x27;ve got to think about my family. That responsibility is greater than to the patient.&quot;

Some doctors thought it was their duty to stay away from the risk of contracting HIV because they had other patients to think of. In a survey of doctors in the mid to late 1980s, a substantial number of physicians indicated that they did not have an ethical obligation to treat and care for those patients affected with HIV/AIDS. A study of primary care providers showed that half would not care for patients if they were given a choice. In 1990, a national survey of doctors showed that &quot;only 24% believed that office-based practitioners should be legally required to provide care to individuals with HIV infection.&quot; Nonetheless, there were many doctors who chose to care for patients affected with HIV/AIDS for different reasons: they shared the same sexual orientation as the infected; a commitment to providing care to the diseased; an interest in the mysteries of infectious disease; and/or a desire to tame the awful threat.

== By race and ethnicity ==

===African Americans===
African Americans are the ethnic group most disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, compared with other races and ethnicities in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black-HIV/AIDS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They represented approximately 12% of the U.S. population in 2018, but accounted for an estimated 43% of new HIV infections in 2017. Furthermore, they make up nearly 52% of AIDS-related deaths in the United States. A 2006 report from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that about half of the 1 million U.S. citizens living with HIV/AIDS were African–American. A 2010 study published on the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; reported that 64% of women infected with HIV/AIDS in the United States were African–American. In 2019, African–American and multiracial populations experienced the highest reported homelessness rates of any other ethnic or racial group diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the United States. In the year 2021, approximately 60% of new HIV diagnoses among women in the United States were represented by Black women.

==== Risk factors contributing to the Black HIV/AIDS rate ====
The United States have a mixed private/public health system, with more privatization than most other developed countries. Access to healthcare services is very important in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS among the U.S. population. It can be affected by health insurance which is available to people through private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid, which leaves many U.S. citizens still vulnerable and untreated. Historically, African Americans have faced discrimination when it comes to receiving healthcare.

Homosexuality is viewed negatively within the African-American community: &quot;In a qualitative study of 745 racially and ethnic diverse undergraduates attending a large Midwestern university, Calzo and Ward (2009) determined that parents of African-American participants discussed homosexuality more frequently than the parents of other respondents. In analyses of the values communicated, Calzo and Ward (2009) reported that Black parents offered greater indication that homosexuality is perverse and unnatural&quot;.

Homosexuality is also seen as a threat to the African-American empowerment. Masculinity is seen as important for the African-American community because it shows that the community is in control of their own destiny. Since the social stigma circling homosexuality is that it is considered &quot;effeminate&quot;, then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity in the African-American community: &quot;Black manhood, then, depends on men&#x27;s ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by economic and cultural factors, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community.&quot; This critical view is influenced by internalized homophobia: &quot;Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual&#x27;s inward direction of society&#x27;s homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995).&quot;

A homophobic culture and discrimination towards LGBTQ+ people is sustained in the African-American community further through the involvement of Black churches and congregations, because religion is a vital part of the African-American community: &quot;As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM.&quot; Because Christianity reiterates homosexuality as a sin and social stigma, the African-American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African-American community.

==== &quot;Down-low&quot; subculture among Black MSM ====

&quot;Down-low&quot; is an African-American slang term specifically used within the African-American community that typically refers to a sexual subculture of Black men who usually identify as heterosexual but actively seek sexual encounters and relations with other men, practice gay cruising, and frequently adopt a specific hip-hop attire during these activities. They generally avoid disclosing their same-sex sexual activities, and often have female sexual partner(s), and may be married or single.

In medical research, the term &quot;down-low&quot; is used to identify sexual identity-behaviour discordance among men who have sex with men (MSM). According to a study published in the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot;, &quot;[t]he Down Low is a lifestyle predominately practiced by young, urban Black men who have sex with other men and women, yet do not identify as gay or bisexual&quot;.

In this context, &quot;being on the &quot;down-low&quot;&quot; is more than just men having sex with men in secret, or a variant of closeted homosexuality or bisexuality—it is a sexual identity that is, at least partly, defined by its &quot;cult of masculinity&quot; and its rejection of what is perceived as White American culture (including what is perceived as White American LGBT culture) and terms. A 2003 cover story in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; on the &quot;down-low&quot; phenomenon explains that the American Black community sees &quot;homosexuality as a white man&#x27;s perversion.&quot; It then goes on to describe the &quot;down-low&quot; subculture as follows:

The CDC cited three findings that relate to African-American men who operate on the &quot;down-low&quot; (engage in MSM activity but don&#x27;t disclose to others):
* African American men who have sex with men (MSM), but who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers), have a high prevalence of HIV infection (14%); nearly three times higher than nondisclosing MSMs of other races/ethnicities (5%).
* Confirming previous research, the study of 5,589 MSM, aged 15–29 years, in six U.S. cities found that African American MSM were more likely not to disclose their sexual orientation compared with white MSM (18% vs. 8%).
* HIV-infected nondisclosers were less likely to know their HIV status (98% were unaware of their infection compared with 75% of HIV-positive disclosers), and more likely to have had recent female sex partners.

===Hispanic and Latino Americans===
Hispanic and Latino Americans are the second ethnic group most disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. The annual number of Hispanics/Latinos newly diagnosed with HIV infection has increased by 7% between 2012 and 2016. Specific Hispanic/Latino populations most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS are men who have sex with men (MSM), accounting for approximately 80% of estimated HIV incidence among Hispanics/Latinos, followed by transgender Hispanic/Latina women and recent Hispanic/Latino immigrants. Hispanics/Latinos represented 16% of the U.S. population but accounted for 21% of new HIV infections in 2010. This disparity is even more apparent among Hispanic/Latina women, which represent 13% of the population but account for 20% of reported HIV/AIDS cases among women in the United States. Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 20% of people living with HIV infection in 2011. Disparities persist in the estimated rate of new HIV infections in Hispanic and Latino Americans In 2010, the rate of new HIV infections for Hispanic/Latino men was 2.9 times that for White American men, and the rate of new infections for Hispanic/Latina women was 4.2 times that for White American women. Since the epidemic began, more than 100,888 Hispanic and Latino Americans with an AIDS diagnosis have died, including 2,863 in 2016.

===Native Americans===
Native American communities in the United States see a higher rate of HIV/AIDS in comparison to White Americans, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander Americans. Although Native Americans with HIV/AIDS only represent roughly 1% of positive cases in the U.S. population, the number of diagnoses among Native American gay and bisexual men rose by 54% between 2011 and 2015. Additionally, the survival rate of diagnosed Native Americans was the lowest of all races in the United States between 1998 and 2005. 

In recent years, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have put in place a &quot;high impact prevention approach&quot; in partnership with the Indian Health Service and the CDC Tribal Advisory Committee to tackle the growing rates in a culturally appropriate way.
The higher rate of HIV/AIDS cases among Native Americans have been attributed to a number of factors, including socioeconomic disadvantages faced by Native American communities, which may result in difficulty accessing healthcare and high-quality housing. It may be more difficult for Native American gay and bisexual men to access healthcare due to living in rural communities, or due to stigma attached to their sexualities. Native Americans have been reported to have higher rates of other STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, which also increases likeliness of contracting or transmitting HIV. 

As there are over 570 federally recognized Native American tribes, there is some difficulty in creating outreach programs which effectively appeal to all tribes whilst remaining culturally appropriate. As well as fear of social stigma from within Native American communities, there may also be a fear among LGBTQ+ Native Americans of a lack of understanding from health professionals in the United States, particularly among Two-Spirit Native Americans. A 2013 NASTAD report calls for the inclusion of LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit Native American peoples in HIV/AIDS program planning and asserts that &quot;health departments should utilize local experts to better understand regional definitions of &quot;Two Spirit&quot; and incorporate modules on Native gay men and Two Spirit people into cultural sensitivity courses for public health service providers&quot;.

=== Racial disparities related to HIV/AIDS treatment ===

While there is no cure for HIV/AIDS as of yet, prevention methods and access to medical care are major ways to know one&#x27;s HIV status, become virally undetectable, and prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS. There are prevention methods to help reduce HIV rates in the United States but these methods are not equally available or accessed. A 2020 study published on the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; reported that the social stigma associated with HIV diagnosis is a &quot;major barrier&quot; that prevents many at-risk and HIV-positive patients from accessing services of HIV prevention and treatment. One prevention method is PrEP, which is a medication taken orally or an injection that prevents HIV transmission. According to the CDC, Pre-exposure prophlyaxis or PrEP usage rates varied significantly by reported race and ethnicity in 2019. For example, out of all the total number of individuals on PrEP, 63% of them identified as White Americans, 8% identified as African Americans, 14% identified as Hispanic and Latino Americans, and 9% identified as other.

Healthcare access varies greatly by race and ethnicity in the United States. Out of those living with HIV/AIDS who received medical care only 63% of Native Americans, 61% of African Americans, 65% of Hispanic and Latino Americans, and 85% of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander Americans were virally suppressed in 2019. This is in comparison to 71% of White Americans who were virally suppressed in 2019 according to the CDC. African–American, Hispanic/Latino, and multiracial populations were significantly more likely to miss at least one medical appointment in the past year compared with White American populations. African–American, Hispanic/Latino, and multiracial populations that were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the United States in 2019 all experienced higher need of dental care, SNAP or WIC benefits, shelter or housing services, and/or mental health services than White American populations according to the CDC.

==== National HIV/AIDS strategy ====
The 2022–2025 National HIV/AIDS strategy &quot;recognizes racism as a serious public health threat that drives and affects both HIV outcomes and disparities&quot;, and while every part of the U.S. is threatened with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, &quot;certain populations bear most of the burden signaling where our HIV prevention, care, and treatment efforts must be focused.&quot; The 2022–2025 National HIV/AIDS strategy focuses on five priority populations including: gay men, bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), in particular African–American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American men; African–American women; transgender women; youth aged 13–24 years; and people who inject drugs.

Sex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence-only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV/AIDS infections, especially among teenagers and young adults.

== Activism and response ==

Starting in the early 1980s, HIV/AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for HIV/AIDS research. These groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This was done through publications and &quot;alternative media&quot; created by those living with or close to the disease.

In contrast to this &quot;alternative media&quot; created by activist groups, mass media reports on HIV/AIDS were not as prevalent, most likely due to the stigma surrounding the topic. The general public was therefore not exposed to information regarding the disease. In addition, the federal government and laws in place essentially prevented individuals affected by HIV/AIDS from getting sufficient information about the disease. Risk reduction education was not easily accessible, so activist groups took action in releasing information to the public through these publications.

AIDS activist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex. They also existed to support people living with HIV/AIDS, offering therapy, support groups, and hospice care. Organizations like Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis, People With AIDS, Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida, the Lesbian AIDS Project, and SisterLove were created to address the needs of certain populations living with HIV/AIDS. Other groups, like the NAMES Project, emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by Yolanda Serrano, coordinated with their local prison, Riker&#x27;s Island Correctional Facility, to advocate for those imprisoned and HIV positive to be released early, so that they could die in the comfort of their own homes.

Both men and women, heterosexual and LGBTQ+ populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because HIV/AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbian women helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish needle exchange programs, fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).

During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, LGBTQ+ communities were further stigmatized as they became the focus of mass hysteria, suffered isolation and marginalization, and were targeted with extreme acts of violence in the United States. Initially when the HIV/AIDS epidemic surfaced in the United States, a large proportion of patients were members of the LGBTQ+ community, leading to further stigmatization of the disease. Because of this, the AIDS activist groups took initiative in testing and experimenting with new possible medications for treating HIV, after researchers outside of the community refused. This research originally done by early AIDS activist groups contributed to treatments still being used today.

Among the landmark legal cases in the history of LGBT rights in the United States on the topic of HIV/AIDS is &quot;Braschi vs. Stahl&quot;. Litigant Miguel Braschi sued his landlord for the right to continue living in their rent controlled apartment after his gay partner Leslie Blanchard died of AIDS. The NY Court of Appeals became the first American appellate court to conclude that same-sex relationships are entitled to legal recognition. The case was litigated at the height of the AIDS crisis and the plaintiff himself died only a year after his groundbreaking court victory. The case focused on emotional and economic interdependency rather than on the existence of legal formalities; the verdict made it more difficult for government officials to reject the notion that same-sex couples could constitute families and that they were entitled to at least some of the protections afforded by law.

=== Response from the Catholic Church ===

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops was the first church body to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in 1987 with a document entitled &quot;.&quot; In the document they stated that the Catholic Church must provide pastoral care to those infected with HIV/AIDS as well as medical care. It called discrimination against people with AIDS &quot;unjust and immoral&quot;. The document also rejected extra-marital sex and the use of condoms, and reiterated the Church&#x27;s teaching that human sexuality was a gift and was to be used in monogamous marriages.

The Catholic Church, with over 117,000 health centers, is the largest private provider of HIV/AIDS care. Individual dioceses around the United States began hiring staff in the 1980s to coordinate AIDS ministry. By 2008, Catholic Charities USA had 1,600 agencies providing services to patients with AIDS, including housing and mental health services. The Archdiocese of New York opened a shelter for AIDS patients in 1985. In the same year, they opened a hotline for people to call for resources and information. The Missionaries of Charity, led by Mother Teresa, opened hospices in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco in the 1980s. Individual parishes began opening hospices for AIDS patients, with the first being in New Orleans in 1985.

The bishops of the United States issued a pastoral letter in the 1980s, titled &quot;A Call to Compassion&quot;, saying those with AIDS &quot;deserve to remain within our communal consciousness and to be embraced with unconditional love.&quot; In Always Our Children, their 1997 pastoral letter on homosexuality, the American bishops noted &quot;an importance and urgency&quot; to minister to those with AIDS, especially considering the impact it had on the gay community. They encouraged church ministers to include prayers at Mass for those with AIDS and those who care for them, those who have died from AIDS, and all of their friends, families, and companions. They recommended special masses be said for healing with anointing of the sick or other events to take place around the time of World AIDS Day.

In 1987, the bishops of California issued a document saying that just as Jesus loved and healed lepers, the blind, the lame, and others, so too should Catholics care for those with AIDS. The year before, they publicly denounced Proposition 64, a measure pushed by Lyndon H. LaRouche to forcibly quarantine those with AIDS, and encouraged Catholics to vote against it. Joseph L. Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago, issued a 12-page policy paper in 1986 that outlined &quot;sweeping pastoral initiatives&quot; his archdiocese would be undertaking.

=== Present-day activism ===
An effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them. In the present day, some AIDS activist groups and organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with HIV/AIDS. They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS activist groups and organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like LGBT pride parades, World AIDS Day, and AIDS Walks.

== Current status ==

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates at the end of 2019, there were 1,189,700 people aged 13 or older with diagnosed HIV infections in the United States and dependent areas. Since 2010, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased, while the annual number of new HIV infections has declined over the past few years. In 2021, 36,136 people were newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, compared to 37,832 diagnosed in 2018. 67% of 2021 diagnoses were among men who have sex with men (MSM), 56% were among American early adolescents and young adults between the ages of 13 and 34, 40% were from the African-American population, and 7% were intravenous drug users.

The 2021 CDC HIV Surveillance Report estimates that 36,136 new cases of HIV infections were diagnosed in the United States in 2021, a rate of 11.3 per 100,000 population. This rate is an increase from the previous year&#x27;s estimates, which indicated 30,585 new infections and a rate of 9.5 per 100,000 population. This increase has been peculiar among epidemiologists, since over the past few years before 2021, rates of HIV infections were decreasing overtime. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (2019–2022), many barriers have made getting tested for HIV/AIDS more difficult, with many who are racially and economically disadvantaged to have reduced resources in terms of testing. 

Individuals in the 25–29 age range had the highest rates of new HIV infections, with a rate of 32.9 per 100,000. With regard to race and ethnicity, the highest rate of new HIV infections in 2017 occurred in the African-American population, with a rate of 4.5 per 100,000. This more than doubled the next highest rate of new HIV infections for a racial or ethnic group, which was the Hispanic/Latino population, with a rate of 3.2 per 100,000. The lowest rate of new HIV infections in 2021 occurred in the Asian American population, with a rate of 2.3 per 100,000.

According to CDC estimates, the most common transmission category of new HIV infections remained male-to-male sexual contact, which accounted for roughly 79% of all new infections in the United States in 2021. Among the proportion of new HIV-positive gay and bisexual men in 2021, 40% are African Americans, 29% are Hispanic/Latino Americans, and 25% are White Americans. With regard to region of residence, the highest rates of new infections in 2021 occurred in the Southern United States, with about 52% of new total cases being from the American South. The region identified as &quot;American South&quot; includes Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. The city of Atlanta has the highest HIV infection rate in the country.

According to CDC estimates, the majority of new HIV infections among White Americans occurred among adult men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 30–39, followed closely by those aged 40–49, while the majority of new HIV infections among African Americans have occurred predominantly among early adolescent and young adult men who have sex with men (aged 13–29). In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM), described as gay and bisexual men, make up about 55% of the total HIV-positive population, and 83% of the estimated new HIV/AIDS diagnoses among all males aged 13 and older, and approximately 92% of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses among all men in their age group. 1 in 6 gay and bisexual men are therefore expected to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in their lifetime if current rates continue. The CDC estimates that more than 600,000 gay and bisexual men are currently living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. A review of four studies in which trans women in the United States were tested for HIV/AIDS found that 27.7% tested positive.

In 2015, a major HIV infection outbreak, Indiana&#x27;s largest-ever, occurred in two largely rural, economically depressed and poor counties in the southern portion of the state, due to the injection of a relatively new opioid-type drug called Opana (oxymorphone), which is designed be taken in pill form but is ground up and injected intravenously using needles. Because of the lack of HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term therapies, HIV/AIDS healthcare, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, and political opposition to needle exchange programs, the outbreak expanded for months, resulting in up to 127 preventable cases. Under pressure, officials eventually declared a state of emergency, but much of the damage had already been done.

<text>A screensaver (or screen saver) is a computer program that blanks the display screen or fills it with moving images or patterns when the computer has been idle for a designated time. The original purpose of screensavers was to prevent phosphor burn-in on CRT or plasma computer monitors (hence the name). Though most modern monitors are not susceptible to this issue (with the notable exception of OLED technology, which has individual pixels vulnerable to burnout), screensaver programs are still used for other purposes. Screensavers are often set up to offer a basic layer of security by requiring a password to re-access the device. Some screensaver programs also use otherwise-idle computer resources to do useful work, such as processing for volunteer computing projects.

As well as computers, modern television operating systems, media players, and other digital entertainment systems may include optional screensavers.

== Purpose ==
=== Screen protection ===
Before the advent of LCD screens, most computer screens were based on cathode-ray tubes (CRTs). When the same image is displayed on a CRT screen for long periods, the properties of the exposed areas of the phosphor coating on the inside of the screen gradually and permanently change, eventually leading to a darkened shadow or &quot;ghost&quot; image on the screen, called a screen burn-in. Cathode-ray tube televisions, oscilloscopes and other devices that use CRTs are all susceptible to phosphor burn-in, as are plasma displays to some extent.

Screen-saver programs were designed to help avoid these effects by automatically changing the images on the screen during periods of user inactivity.

For CRTs used in public, such as ATMs and railway ticketing machines, the risk of burn-in is especially high because a stand-by display is shown whenever the machine is not in use. Older machines designed without burn-in problems taken into consideration often display evidence of screen damage, with images or text such as &quot;Please insert your card&quot; (in the case of ATMs) visible even when the display changes while the machine is in use. Blanking the screen is not a valid option as the machine can be perceived as out of service. In these applications, burn-in can be prevented by shifting the position of the display contents every few seconds, or by having a number of different images that are changed regularly.

Later CRTs were much less susceptible to burn-in than older models due to improvements in phosphor coatings, and because modern computer images are generally lower contrast than the stark green- or white-on-black text and graphics of earlier machines. LCD computer monitors, including the display panels used in laptop computers, are not susceptible to burn-in because the image is not directly produced by phosphors (although they can suffer from a less extreme and usually non-permanent form of image persistence).

=== Modern usage ===

While modern screens are not susceptible to the issues discussed above, screensavers are still used. Primarily these are for decorative/entertainment purposes, or for password protection. They usually feature moving images or patterns and sometimes sound effects.

As screensavers are generally expected to activate when users are away from their machines, many screensavers can be configured to ask users for a password before permitting the user to resume work. This is a basic security measure against another person accessing the machine while the user is absent.

Some screensavers activate a useful background task, such as a virus scan or a volunteer computing application (such as the SETI@home project). This allows applications to use resources only when the computer would be otherwise idle. The Ken Burns panning and zooming effect is sometimes used to bring the image to life.

== History ==
Decades before the first computers using this technology were invented, Robert A. Heinlein gave an example of how they might be used in his novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961):
The first screensaver was allegedly written for the original IBM PC by John Socha, best known for creating Norton Commander; he also coined the term &quot;screen saver&quot;. The screensaver, named &quot;scrnsave&quot;, was published in the December 1983 issue of the &quot;Softalk&quot; magazine. It simply blanked the screen after three minutes of inactivity (an interval which could be changed by recompiling the program).

By 1983 a Zenith Data Systems executive included &quot;screen-saver&quot; among the new Z-29 computer terminal&#x27;s features, telling &quot;InfoWorld&quot; that it &quot;blanks out the display after 15 minutes of nonactivity, preventing burned-in character displays.&quot; The first screensaver that allowed users to change the activating time was released on Apple&#x27;s Lisa, in 1983.

The Atari 400 and 800&#x27;s screens would also go through random screensaver-like color changes if they were left inactive for about 8 minutes. Normal users had no control over this, though programs did. These computers, released in 1979, are technically earlier &quot;screen savers&quot;. Prior to these computers, games for the 1977 Atari VCS/2600 gaming console such as Combat and Breakout, included color cycling in order to prevent burn-in of game images into 1970s-era televisions. In addition, the first model of the TI-30 calculator from 1976 featured a screensaver, which consisted of a decimal point running across the display after 30 seconds of inactivity. This was chiefly used to save battery power, as the TI-30 LED display was more power intensive than later LCD models. These are examples of screensavers in ROM or the firmware of a computer.

Android 4.2 introduced &quot;daydreams&quot;, screensavers that activate while the device is docked or charging.

In 2015 the screensaver &quot;Event Listeners&quot; of van den Dorpel became the first work of art that was purchased by a museum (Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna) using the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

Modern graphics technologies such as 3D computer graphics have allowed a wide variety of screensavers to be made. Screensavers with realistic 3D environments can be programmed and run on modern computers.

== Underlying architecture ==
Screensavers are usually designed and coded using a variety of programming languages as well as graphics interfaces. Typically the authors of screensavers use the C or C++ programming languages, along with Graphics Device Interface (GDI), such as OpenGL (&quot;Open Graphics Library&quot;, which works on many, if not most, platforms capable of 3D rendering), or alternatives such as Microsoft DirectX (which is limited to Microsoft platforms, mainly Microsoft Windows and the Microsoft Xbox), to craft their final products. Several OS X screensavers are created and designed using Quartz Composer. The screensaver interfaces indirectly with the operating system to cause the physical display screen to be overlaid with one or more graphic &quot;scenes&quot;. The screensaver typically terminates after receiving a message from the operating system that a key has been pressed or the mouse has been moved.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
If the system detects inactivity lasting longer than the time specified in the control panel, check if the active program is a simple program (and not another screensaver) by sending the &quot;codice_1&quot; message with the &quot;codice_2&quot; argument. If the program calls in response the standard system function (codice_3), the screensaver defined in the control panel screen runs.

A Windows screensaver is a regular Portable Executable (PE) with the codice_4 file extension. This enables malware authors to add &quot;.scr&quot; to the name of any win32 executable file, and thereby increase likelihood that users of Microsoft Windows will run it unintentionally. In addition, this program should support the following command line parameters:

With no parameter – shows the Settings dialog box or do nothing.
 ScreenSaver.scr codice_5
Runs the screensaver.
 ScreenSaver.scr codice_6 or codice_7 &lt;HWND&gt;
Previews the screensaver as child of window. codice_8 (presented as unsigned decimal number) is an identifier (handle) of the window in which the preview should appear.
 ScreenSaver.scr codice_9
Shows the Settings dialog box, modal to the foreground window.
 ScreenSaver.scr codice_10&lt;HWND&gt;

Changes password, modal to window codice_8. Windows 95 screensavers must handle it.

=== macOS ===
Under macOS, screensavers are regular macOS application bundles with the codice_12 file extension.

Internally, the screensaver must define a class that is subclass of codice_13. The new class must be assigned as codice_14 in the xcode project, so that when the screensaver is launched by the system, this class gets instantiated.

=== Atari ===
As one of the first screensavers appeared in 8-bit Atari computers, forcing systemic color changes when the computer is idle lasting a few minutes (different times depending on the model), stored in the system ROM of the computer.

== Considerations ==
Monitors running screensavers consume the same amount of power as when running normally, which can be anywhere from a few watts for small LCD monitors to several hundred for large plasma displays. Most modern computers can be set to switch the monitor into a lower power mode, blanking the screen altogether. A power-saving mode for monitors is usually part of the power management options supported in modern operating systems, though it must also be supported by the computer hardware and monitor itself.

Using a screensaver with a flat panel or TFT LCD screen not powering down the screen can actually decrease the lifetime of the display, since the fluorescent backlight remains lit and ages faster than it would if the screen is turned off and on frequently. As fluorescent tubes age they grow progressively dimmer, and they can be expensive or difficult to replace. A typical LCD screen loses about 50% of its brightness during a normal product lifetime. In most cases, the tube is an integral part of the LCD and the entire assembly needs to be replaced. This is not true of LED backlit displays.

Thus the term &quot;screen saver&quot; is now something of a misnomer – the best way to save the screen and also save electricity consumed by screen would simply be to have the computer turn off the monitor. Screensavers displaying complex 3D graphics might even add to overall power draw.

== Entertainment ==
&quot;After Dark&quot; was an early screensaver for the Macintosh platform, and later PC/Windows, which prominently featured whimsical designs such as &quot;flying toasters&quot;. Perhaps in response to the workplace environment in which they are often viewed, many screensavers continue this legacy of whimsy by populating the idle monitor with animals or fish, video games, and visual expressions of mathematics equations (through the use of fractals, Fourier transforms or other means) as in the Electric Sheep screensaver.

At least one screensaver, &quot;Johnny Castaway&quot;, told a humorous animated story over many months. The ability of screensavers to divert and entertain is used for promotion, especially to build buzz for &quot;event-based&quot; products such as feature films.

The screensaver is also a creative outlet for computer programmers. The Unix-based screensaver XScreenSaver collects the display effects of other Unix screensavers, which are termed &quot;display hacks&quot; in the &quot;Jargon File&quot; tradition of US computer science academics. It also collects forms of computer graphics effects called &quot;demo effects&quot;, such as were originally produced by the demoscene.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
On older versions of Microsoft Windows the native screensaver format had the potential to install a virus when run (as a screen saver was just an ordinary application with a different extension). When any file with the file suffix &quot;.scr&quot; was opened, for example from an email attachment, Windows would execute the .scr (screensaver) file automatically: this had the potential to allow a virus or malware to install itself. Modern versions of Windows can read tags left by applications such as Internet Explorer and verify the publisher of the file, presenting a confirmation to the user.

On August 5, 2006, the BBC reported that &quot;free screensavers&quot; and &quot;screensavers&quot; respectively were the first and third most likely search terms to return links to malware, the second being BearShare.

By launching the &quot;bubbles&quot; screensaver executable through the codice_15 command-line parameter, it runs as desktop wallpaper, the bubbles are smaller, and there are more bubbles on screen. The user must use the Task Manager to stop the screensaver.

<text>Blue Note Records is an American jazz record label now owned by Universal Music Group and operated under Capitol Music Group. Established in 1939 by German-Jewish emigrants Alfred Lion and Max Margulis, it derived its name from the blue notes of jazz and the blues. Originally dedicated to recording traditional jazz and small group swing, the label began to switch its attention to modern jazz around 1947. From there, Blue Note grew to become one of the most prolific, influential and respected jazz labels of the mid-20th century, noted for its role in facilitating the development of hard bop, post-bop and avant-garde jazz, as well as for its iconic modernist art direction.

==History==
Historically, Blue Note has principally been associated with the &quot;hard bop&quot; style of jazz (mixing bebop with other forms of music including soul, blues, rhythm and blues and gospel), but also recorded essential albums in the avant-garde and free styles of jazz. Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Art Blakey, Grant Green, Hank Mobley, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Hutcherson, and Jackie McLean were among the label&#x27;s leading artists. During its heyday, the 1950s and 1960s, the photography and graphic art of Reid Miles created a series of iconic album covers, often incorporating session photos by Francis Wolff, which added to Blue Note&#x27;s artistic reputation.

===Early years===
Lion first heard jazz as a young boy in Berlin. He settled in New York City in 1937, and shortly after the first From Spirituals to Swing concert, recorded pianists Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis in 1939 during a one-day session in a rented studio. The Blue Note label initially consisted of Lion and Max Margulis, a communist writer who funded the project. The label&#x27;s first releases were traditional &quot;hot&quot; jazz and boogie woogie, and the label&#x27;s first hit was a performance of &quot;Summertime&quot; by soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet, which Bechet had been unable to record for the established companies. Musicians were supplied with alcoholic refreshments, and recorded in the early hours of the morning after their evening&#x27;s work in clubs and bars had finished. The label soon became known for treating musicians uncommonly well—setting up recording sessions at congenial times, and allowing the artists to be involved in all aspects of the record&#x27;s production.

Francis Wolff, a professional photographer, emigrated to the US at the end of 1939 and soon joined forces with Lion, a childhood friend. In 1941, Lion was drafted into the army for two years. Milt Gabler at the Commodore Music Store offered storage facilities and helped keep the catalog in print, with Wolff working for him. By late 1943, the label was back in business recording musicians and supplying records to the armed forces. Willing to record artists that most other labels would consider to be uncommercial, in December 1943 the label initiated more sessions with artists such as pianist Art Hodes, trumpeter Sidney De Paris, clarinetist Edmond Hall, and Harlem stride pianist James P. Johnson, who was returning to a high degree of musical activity after having largely recovered from a stroke suffered in 1940.

===Lion and Wolff embrace bebop===

Towards the end of the Second World War, saxophonist Ike Quebec was among those who recorded for the label. Quebec would act as a talent scout for the label until his death in 1963. Although stylistically belonging to a previous generation, he could appreciate the new bebop style of jazz, the creation of which is usually attributed to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.

In 1947, pianist Thelonious Monk recorded his first sessions as a leader for the label, which were also the Blue Note debut of drummer Art Blakey, who also recorded his first session as leader for the label at this time. Lion recorded several Monk sessions before he began to release the resulting sides. Monk&#x27;s recordings for Blue Note between 1947 and 1952 did not sell well for some years, but have since come to be regarded as the most important of his career. Other bebop or modernist musicians who recorded for Blue Note during the late 1940s and early 1950s were pianist Tadd Dameron, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Howard McGhee, saxophonist James Moody and pianist Bud Powell. The sessions by Powell are commonly ranked among his best. J. J. Johnson and trumpeter Miles Davis both recorded several sessions for Blue Note between 1952 and 1954, but by then the musicians who had created bebop were starting to explore other styles.

The recording of musicians performing in an earlier jazz idiom, such as Sidney Bechet and clarinettist George Lewis, continued into the 1950s.

===Hard bop and beyond===
In 1951, Blue Note issued their first vinyl 10&quot; releases. The label was soon recording emerging talent such as Horace Silver (who would stay with Blue Note for a quarter of a century) and Clifford Brown. Meanwhile, Milt Jackson (as the leader of what became the Modern Jazz Quartet) and the Jazz Messengers (originally organised as a cooperative, but soon to become Art Blakey&#x27;s group) recorded for Blue Note. The Milt Jackson Quartet session was a one-off, but Blakey&#x27;s various groups recorded for the label extensively, if intermittently, for the next decade. Rudy Van Gelder recorded most Blue Note releases from 1953, after Lion and Van Gelder&#x27;s mutual friend, saxophonist and composer Gil Melle, introduced them. A difference between Blue Note and other independent labels (for example Prestige Records, who also employed Van Gelder) was that musicians were paid for rehearsal time prior to the recording session: this helped ensure a better end result on the record. Producer Bob Porter of Prestige Records once said that &quot;The difference between Blue Note and Prestige is two days&#x27; rehearsal.&quot; When the recording industry switched to 12&quot; LP in the mid-1950s, Blue Note was in difficulties. Their catalog on the now outmoded 10&quot; LP now had to be recreated on the newer format. Lion contemplated selling out to Atlantic at this time, an option which was not acted upon. A musician who was to become one of the label&#x27;s best sellers was discovered. Jimmy Smith, the Hammond organist was signed in 1956, and performed on the label&#x27;s first 12&quot; LP album of new recordings.

The mid-to-late 1950s saw debut recordings for Blue Note by (among others) Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Herbie Nichols, Sonny Clark, Kenny Dorham, Kenny Burrell, Jackie McLean, Donald Byrd and Lou Donaldson. Sonny Rollins recorded for the label in 1956 and 1957 and Bud Powell briefly returned. John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Blue Train&quot;, and Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; (featuring Miles Davis in one of his last supporting roles) were guest appearances on the label. Blue Note was by then recording a mixture of established acts (Rollins, Adderley) and artists who in some cases had recorded before, but often produced performances for the label which by far exceeded earlier recordings in quality (&quot;Blue Train&quot; is often considered to be the first significant recording by Coltrane as a leader). Horace Silver and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers continued to release a series of artistically and commercially successful recordings.

The early 1960s saw Dexter Gordon join the label. Gordon was a saxophonist from the bebop era who had spent several years in prison for narcotic offences, and he made several albums for Blue Note over a five-year period, including several at the beginning of his sojourn in Europe. Gordon also appeared on the debut album by Herbie Hancock - by the mid 1960s, all four of the younger members of the Miles Davis quintet (Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Tony Williams) were recording for the label, and Hancock and Shorter in particular produced a succession of superb albums in a mix of styles. Carter did not actually record under his own name until the label&#x27;s revival in the 1980s, but played double bass on many other musicians&#x27; sessions. Many of these also included Freddie Hubbard, a trumpeter who also recorded for the label as a leader. One of the features of the label during this period was a &quot;family&quot; of musicians (Hubbard, Hancock, Carter, Grant Green, Joe Henderson, Kenny Dorham, Lee Morgan, Blue Mitchell, Hank Mobley and many others) who would record as sidemen on each other&#x27;s albums without necessarily being part of the leader&#x27;s working group.

The early 1960s also saw three Blue Note recordings by pianist/composer Freddie Redd, one of which, &quot;The Connection&quot;, used music written for the play by Jack Gelber and its film version.

In 1963, Lee Morgan scored a significant hit with the title track of &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; album, and Horace Silver did the same the following year with &quot;Song for My Father&quot;. As a result, Lion was under pressure by independent distributors to come up with similar successes, with the result that many Blue Note albums of this era start with a catchy tune intended for heavy airplay in the United States.

At the end of the 1950s, and in the early 1960s, Blue Note headquarters were located in New York City, at West 61st Street, and at 47 W 63rd Street.

===The avant-garde===
Although many of the acts on Blue Note were recording jazz for a wide audience, the label also documented some of the emerging avant-garde and free jazz players. Andrew Hill, a highly individual pianist, made many albums for the label, one featuring multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy. Dolphy&#x27;s &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot; (featuring a celebrated cover by Reid Miles) is perhaps his best-known album. Saxophonist Ornette Coleman released two albums recorded with a trio in a Stockholm club, and three studio albums (including &quot;The Empty Foxhole&quot;, with his then ten-year-old son Denardo Coleman on drums). Pianist Cecil Taylor recorded a brace of albums for Blue Note, as did trombonist Grachan Moncur III, and saxophonist Sam Rivers, drummer Tony Williams, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and organist Larry Young also recorded albums which diverged from the &quot;hard bop&quot; style usually associated with the label.

Saxophonist Jackie McLean, a stalwart of the label&#x27;s hard bop output since the late 1950s, also crossed over into the avant-garde in the early 1960s, whose notable avant-garde albums included &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Destination Out&quot; and on (as a side man) trombonist Grachan Moncur III&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot;.

Though these avant-garde records did not sell as well as some other Blue Note releases, Lion thought it was important to document new developments in jazz.
===Cover art===

In 1956, Blue Note employed Reid Miles, an artist who worked for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. The cover art produced by Miles, often featuring Wolff&#x27;s photographs of musicians in the studio, was as influential in the world of graphic design as the music within would be in the world of jazz. Under Miles, Blue Note was known for their striking and unusual album cover designs. Miles&#x27; graphical design was distinguished by its tinted black and white photographs, creative use of sans-serif typefaces, and restricted color palette (often black and white with a single color), and frequent use of solid rectangular bands of color or white, influenced by the Bauhaus school of design.

Though Miles&#x27; work is closely associated with Blue Note and has earned iconic status and frequent homage, Miles was only a casual jazz fan, according to Richard Cook; Blue Note gave him several copies of each of the many dozens of albums he designed, but Miles gave most to friends or sold them to second-hand record shops. A few mid-1950s album covers featured drawings by a then-unknown Andy Warhol.

Some of his most celebrated designs adorned the sleeves of albums such as &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot;, &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;, &quot;Hub-Tones&quot;, &quot;No Room for Squares&quot;, &quot;Cool Struttin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;.

===Lion retires; Wolff dies===
Blue Note was acquired by Liberty Records in 1965 and Lion, who had difficulties working within a larger organization, retired in 1967. Reid Miles&#x27; association with the label ended around this time. For a few years most albums were produced by Wolff or pianist Duke Pearson, who had succeeded Ike Quebec in A&amp;R in 1963 after he died, but Wolff died in 1971 and Pearson left in the same year.

At the end of the 1960s, the company headquarters were moved to 1776 Broadway.

===Revival and ownership history===

In 1979, EMI purchased United Artists Records, which had absorbed Liberty Records in 1971, and phased out the Blue Note label, which lay dormant until 1985, when it was relaunched as part of EMI Manhattan Records (both for re-issues and new recordings for which Bruce Lundvall was appointed). Some artists previously associated with Blue Note, such as McCoy Tyner, made new recordings, while younger musicians such as Bennie Wallace, Joe Lovano, John Scofield, Greg Osby, Jason Moran and arranger–composer Bob Belden have established notable reputations through their Blue Note albums. The label has also found great commercial success with the vocalist Norah Jones, and released new albums by established artists on the fringes of jazz such as Van Morrison, Al Green, Anita Baker and newcomer Amos Lee, sometimes referred to as the &quot;male Norah Jones&quot;. Two of the leading trumpeters of the 1980s Jazz Resurgence, Wynton Marsalis and Terence Blanchard signed with the label in 2003. Hip-hop producer Madlib recorded &quot;Shades of Blue&quot; in 2003, as a tribute to Blue Note, with samples from earlier records on the label.

Blue Note has pursued an active reissue program since the mid-1980s revival, and Michael Cuscuna has worked as freelance advisor and reissue producer. Some of the original Blue Note&#x27;s output has appeared in CD box sets issued by Mosaic Records (also involving Cuscuna). Blue Note Records became the flagship jazz label for Capitol Records, and was the parent label for the Capitol Jazz, Pacific Jazz, Roulette and other labels within Capitol&#x27;s holdings which had possessed a jazz line. The &quot;RVG series&quot;, Rudy Van Gelder remastering his own recordings from decades earlier began around 1998.

In 2006, EMI expanded Blue Note to create The Blue Note Label Group by moving its Narada group of labels to New York to join with Blue Note, centralizing EMI&#x27;s approach to music for the adult market segment. The labels newly under the Blue Note umbrella are Angel Records, EMI Classics and Virgin Classics (classical music), Narada Productions (contemporary jazz and world-influenced music, including exclusively licensed sub-label Real World Records), Back Porch Records (folk and Americana), Higher Octave Records (smooth jazz and New-age music), and Mosaic Records (devoted exclusively to reissuing jazz recordings in limited-edition boxed sets). As of June 2007, Bruce Lundvall, founder of Manhattan Records, as President/CEO of the Blue Note Label Group, was at the time reporting directly to Eric Nicoli, then Chief Executive Officer of EMI Group.

In 2008, the Blue Note 7, a jazz septet, was formed in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. The group recorded an album in 2008, entitled &quot;&quot;, which was released in 2009 on Blue Note Records/EMI, and toured the United States in promotion of the album from January until April 2009. The group consists of Peter Bernstein (guitar), Bill Charlap (piano), Ravi Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Lewis Nash (drums), Nicholas Payton (trumpet), Peter Washington (bass), and Steve Wilson (alto saxophone, flute). The group plays the music of Blue Note Records from various artists, with arrangements by members of the band and Renee Rosnes.

Following the acquisition of EMI by Universal, Don Was became President of Blue Note in January 2012, after an appointment as CEO a few months earlier, in succession to Bruce Lundvall. Lundvall, who stood down in 2010, became Chairman Emeritus

In May 2013, Blue Note Records partnered with ArtistShare to form a label called &quot;Blue Note/ArtistShare&quot;. The Blue Note/ArtistShare partnership was forged by ArtistShare founder Brian Camelio, Bruce Lundvall, and Don Was.

After Universal Music Group took over EMI, Blue Note Records is now operated under Capitol Music Group, while Decca Records took over UK distribution of Blue Note.

===Modern era===
Blue Note has seen a continuity in releases from older artists such as Shorter, Charles Lloyd, Louis Hayes, and Dr. Lonnie Smith. In 2019, the imprint announced the launch of a vinyl reissue series of classic titles, with releases selected and produced by Grammy-nominated producer and jazz expert Joe Harley. The series, named the &quot;Tone Poet series&quot; in honor of Harley, reissues several titles each year from the Blue Note catalogue. In 2020, Blue Note released the debut of South African artist Nduduzo Makhathini, called &quot;Modes of Communication: Letters from the Underworlds&quot;. It was named one of the &quot;Best Jazz Albums of 2020&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and was followed by &quot;In the Spirit of Ntu&quot; in 2022, and &quot;uNomkhubulwane&quot; in 2024.

==Legacy==
There has been much sampling of classic Blue Note tracks by both hip hop artists and for mashing projects. In 1993, the group Us3 designed the entirety of its debut album upon samples from classic Blue Note records. In 2003, hip-hop producer Madlib released &quot;Shades of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note&quot;, a collection of his remixes and interpretations of Blue Note music. Pete Rock, J Dilla, and DJ Spinna have likewise been involved in similar projects. In 2004, Burning Vision Entertainment created the video for Helicopter Girl&#x27;s &quot;Angel City&quot;, using the art from numerous Blue Note LP sleeves to startling effect. In 2008, hip-hop producer Questlove of The Roots compiled &quot;Droppin&#x27; Science: Greatest Samples from the Blue Note Lab&quot;, a collection of original Blue Note recordings sampled by modern-day hip-hop artists such as Dr. Dre and A Tribe Called Quest.

<text>Paul Charles Morphy (June 22, 1837July 10, 1884) was an American chess player. During his brief career in the late 1850s, Morphy was acknowledged as the world&#x27;s greatest chess master.

A prodigy, Morphy emerged onto the chess scene in 1857 by convincingly winning the First American Chess Congress, winning each by a large margin. He then traveled to Europe, residing for a time in England and France while challenging the continent&#x27;s top players. He played matches with most of the leading English and French players, as well as the German Adolf Anderssen—again winning all matches by large margins. In 1859, Morphy returned to the United States, before ultimately abandoning competitive chess and receding from public view. 

Due to his early exit from the game despite his unprecedented talent, Morphy has been called &quot;The Pride and Sorrow of Chess&quot;. This epithet has often been credited to Sheriff Walter Cook Spens, chess editor of the &quot;Glasgow Weekly Herald&quot;, but it is unclear when it first appeared in print.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Morphy was born in New Orleans to a prominent wealthy family. His father Alonzo Morphy, of Spanish and Irish ancestry, was a lawyer. He later served as a Louisiana state legislator, Attorney General, and a Louisiana State Supreme Court Justice. Morphy&#x27;s mother, Louise Thérèse Felicitie Thelcide Le Carpentier, was a musically talented woman from a prominent French Creole family. Paul grew up in an atmosphere of cultivated, genteel civility, where chess and music were the typical highlights of a Sunday home gathering.

Sources differ about when and how Morphy learned to play chess. According to his uncle, Ernest Morphy, no one formally taught the young Morphy how to play chess; rather, he simply learned by watching others play. After observing Ernest and Alonzo abandon what had been a lengthy game, conceding that it was a draw—Paul spoke up, stating that Ernest should have won. This surprised the two men, who had not realized that Paul knew the rules of the game, let alone any notion of strategy. They were even more surprised when Paul proved his claim by resetting the pieces and demonstrating the win his uncle had missed. Biographer Frederick Milnes Edge dismisses this anecdote as apocryphal, however. In 1845, Ernest acted as the second for Eugène Rousseau in his match against Charles H. Stanley, and took the young Paul along with him.

===Childhood victories===
By 1846, the nine-year-old Morphy was considered one of the best players in New Orleans. That year, General Winfield Scott visited the city while on his way to the war with Mexico. He informed his hosts that he wanted to spend an evening playing chess against a strong local opponent. While he only played infrequently, Scott enjoyed chess and considered himself to be a formidable player. The arrangements were made, and a game was set up after dinner. When Morphy was brought in, Scott initially took offense to a child being offered as his opponent, believing he was being made fun of. However, after being assured that his wishes had been scrupulously obeyed, and that Morphy was a chess prodigy who would prove his skill, Scott agreed to play. Morphy easily defeated Scott in both of the games they played, ending the second game by after only six moves.

During 1848 and 1849, Morphy competed against the leading players in New Orleans. He played at least fifty games against Eugène Rousseau, considered to be the strongest of Morphy&#x27;s opponents during this era, and lost at most five. In 1850, Hungarian chess master Johann Löwenthal visited New Orleans. Löwenthal, a refugee of the Hungarian revolution of 1848, had visited various American cities and competed successfully against the best local players. He accepted an invitation to Judge Morphy&#x27;s house to play against Paul, now twelve years old. Löwenthal soon realized he was facing a formidable opponent: each time Morphy made a good move, Löwenthal&#x27;s eyebrows shot up in a manner described by Ernest Morphy as &quot;&quot;. Löwenthal played three games against Morphy during his stay in New Orleans, with sources recording him as either having two losses and one draw, or as losing all three games.

===Schooling and the First American Chess Congress===

Beginning in 1850, Morphy played relatively little chess for a number of years, instead focusing on his education. Diligent in his studies, he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1854 from Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, with his graduating thesis detailing what he saw as the narrow logical limits on justifications for war and secession by the southern states. He proceeded to spend an additional year on campus studying mathematics and philosophy, and in May 1855 was awarded a master&#x27;s degree with the highest honors.

Morphy went on to study law at the University of Louisiana (now Tulane University), receiving an LL.B. degree on April 7, 1857. It has been claimed that Morphy memorized the complete Louisiana Civil Code during the course of his studies.

Not yet the required age to practice law, Morphy found himself with free time after graduation. That year, he received an invitation to participate in the First American Chess Congress, to be held from October 6 to November 10, 1857, in New York. Morphy initially declined, but later changed his mind at the urging of Alexander Beaufort Meek, a judge and close family friend. The main event of the Congress was a 16-man knockout tournament, with each round consisting of short multi-game matches contested by the opponents. Also competing was the strong German chess master Louis Paulsen, who was already aware of Morphy&#x27;s talent, and said openly beforehand that he would be the tournament&#x27;s victor. Moreover, while the competition was underway Paulsen repeatedly stated that if Morphy were to visit Europe, he could prove his status as the game&#x27;s greatest living player. As predicted by Paulsen, Morphy defeated James Thompson in the first round, his family friend Meek in the quarter-finals, the German master Theodor Lichtenhein in the semifinals, and ultimately Paulsen himself in the finals, to win the tournament&#x27;s grand prize.

After his victory, Morphy was immediately hailed as the chess champion of the United States, but he appeared to be unaffected by his sudden fame. According to the December 1857 issue of &quot;Chess Monthly&quot;, &quot;his genial disposition, his unaffected modesty and gentlemanly courtesy have endeared him to all his acquaintances.&quot; While staying in New York during the fall of 1857, Morphy played 261 games, both with and without odds. In regular games, Morphy&#x27;s overall record was 87 wins, 8 draws, and 5 losses.

Also in 1857, Morphy founded the Chess Club of New Orleans, becoming its first President. Early in the following year, he was recruited by Daniel Fiske to serve as co-editor of his &quot;Chess Monthly&quot; publication, a position he held until the end of 1860.
===Europe===

Up to this time, Morphy was not well known or highly regarded in Europe. Despite his dominance of the American chess scene, the quality of his opponents was relatively low compared to Europe, where most of the best chess players lived. European opinion was that they should not have to make the journey to the United States to play a young and relatively unknown player, especially as the United States had few other quality players to make such a trip worthwhile.

Morphy returned to his home city with no further action. The New Orleans Chess Club determined that a direct challenge should be made to European champion Howard Staunton.

Staunton made an official reply through &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, stating that it was not possible for him to travel to the United States and that Morphy must come to Europe if he wished to challenge him and other European chess players.


Eventually, Morphy went to Europe to play Staunton and other chess greats. Morphy made numerous attempts at setting up a match with Staunton, but none ever came through. Staunton was later criticized for avoiding a match with Morphy, although his peak as a player had been in the 1840s and he was considered past his prime by the late 1850s. Staunton is known to have been working on his edition of the complete works of Shakespeare at the time, but he also competed in a chess tournament during Morphy&#x27;s visit. Staunton later blamed Morphy for the failure to have a match, suggesting among other things that Morphy lacked the funds required for match stakes—a most unlikely charge given Morphy&#x27;s popularity. Morphy also remained resolutely opposed to playing chess for money, reportedly due to family pressure.

Seeking new opponents, Morphy crossed the English Channel to France. At Paris&#x27;s Café de la Régence, the center of French chess, Morphy soundly defeated resident chess professional Daniel Harrwitz. While there, he also defeated eight opponents in blindfolded simultaneous exhibitions.

In Paris, Morphy suffered from a bout of gastroenteritis. In accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing a significant amount of blood. Although too weak to stand up unaided, Morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting German master Adolf Anderssen, considered by many to be Europe&#x27;s leading player. The match between Morphy and Anderssen took place between December 20, 1858, and December 28, 1858, when Morphy was still only 21 years of age. Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. When asked about his defeat, Anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion La Bourdonnais.

Morphy gave numerous simultaneous exhibitions in both England and France, sometimes while blindfolded, in which he regularly played and defeated eight opponents at a time.

===Hailed as champion===

Still only 21 years old, Morphy was now quite famous. While in Paris, he was sitting in his hotel room one evening, chatting with his companion Frederick Edge, when they had an unexpected visitor. &quot;I am Prince Galitzin; I wish to see Mr. Morphy&quot;, the visitor said, according to Edge. Morphy identified himself to the visitor. &quot;No, it is not possible!&quot; the prince exclaimed, &quot;You are too young!&quot; Prince Galitzin then explained that he was in the frontiers of Siberia when he had first heard of Morphy&#x27;s &quot;wonderful deeds&quot;. He explained, &quot;One of my suite had a copy of the chess paper published in Berlin, the &quot;Schachzeitung&quot;, and ever since that time I have been wanting to see you.&quot; He then told Morphy that he must go to Saint Petersburg, Russia, because the chess club in the Imperial Palace would receive him with enthusiasm.

Morphy offered to play a match with Harrwitz, giving odds of pawn and move, and even offered to find stakes to back his opponent, but the offer was declined. Morphy then declared that he would play no more formal matches, with anyone, without giving at least those odds.

In Europe, Morphy was generally hailed as world chess champion. In Paris, at a banquet held in his honor on April 4, 1859, a laurel wreath was placed over the head of a bust of Morphy, carved by the sculptor Eugène-Louis Lequesne. Morphy was declared by St. Amant &quot;the first Chess player in the whole world&quot;. At a similar gathering in London, where he returned in the spring of 1859, Morphy was again proclaimed &quot;the Champion of the Chess World&quot;. He may also have been invited to a private audience with Queen Victoria. At a simultaneous match against five masters, Morphy won two games against Jules Arnous de Rivière and Henry Edward Bird, drew two games with Samuel Boden and Johann Jacob Löwenthal, and lost one to Thomas Wilson Barnes.

Upon his return to America, the accolades continued as Morphy toured the major cities on his way home. At the University of the City of New York, on May 29, 1859, John Van Buren, son of President Martin Van Buren, ended a testimonial presentation by proclaiming, &quot;Paul Morphy, Chess Champion of the World&quot;. In Boston, at a banquet attended by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Louis Agassiz, Boston mayor Frederic W. Lincoln Jr., and Harvard president James Walker, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes toasted &quot;Paul Morphy, the world&#x27;s Chess Champion&quot;. Consumer products including the &quot;Morphy Hat&quot; and the &quot;Morphy Cigar&quot; were named for him, as was the Morphy Baseball Club in Brooklyn.

At the New York testimonial dinner, Morphy made an assessment of chess that has been widely paraphrased:

Nowadays this may seem ironic or even paradoxical in light of Morphy&#x27;s dedication to chess. But at the time, Morphy&#x27;s remarks did not cause surprise.

Morphy was engaged to write a series of chess columns for the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;, which started in August of 1859. They consisted primarily of annotating games of the La Bourdonnais – McDonnell chess matches of 25 years before, plus a few of Morphy&#x27;s own games. The column ended in August of 1860.

===Retirement from chess and later life===

After returning home in 1859, Morphy intended to start a career in law. He did not immediately cease playing serious chess; on a visit to Cuba in 1864, he played a number of games with leading players of that country, including Celso Golmayo Zúpide, the champion, all at odds of a knight. For the rest of his life, Morphy would not compete in another tournament or serious match without odds, a stipulation he would stress repeatedly.

Morphy was late to start his law career, not having done so by the time the American Civil War broke out in 1861. His brother Edward had joined the army of the Confederacy at the very beginning of the war, while his mother and sisters had emigrated to Paris. Not much is known about Morphy&#x27;s Civil War service; David Lawson cites contemporary reports that Morphy had briefly been on the staff of Pierre Beauregard, as well as being seen at the First Battle of Manassas. Lawson also recounts a recollection by a Richmond resident in 1861 describing Morphy as being &quot;an officer on Beauregard&#x27;s staff&quot;. Other sources indicate that Beauregard considered Morphy to be unqualified, but that he had indeed applied for a staff position. During the war, he spent time both in New Orleans and abroad, spending time in Havana (1862, 1864) and Paris (1863).

After the war, Morphy remained unable to build a successful law practice. According to records, Morphy attempted at least three times to open and advertise a law office, with each endeavor ultimately being abandoned. It has been speculated that his celebrity as a chess player worked against him, overshadowing his attempted practice. Financially secure thanks to his family&#x27;s fortune, Morphy essentially spent the rest of his life in idleness. When asked by admirers to return to chess competition, he refused. In 1883, Morphy encountered Wilhelm Steinitz on the street while Steinitz was visiting New Orleans, but declined to discuss chess with him.

===Mental illness===
Morphy showed signs of deteriorating mental health in his final years. By 1875, his mother, brother and a friend tried to admit him to a Catholic sanitarium, but Morphy was so well able to argue for his rights and sanity that they sent him away. Morphy had shown signs of a persecution complex; he sued his brother-in-law, for example, and tried to provoke a duel with a friend. Hertan notes that it is not easy to determine just when this behavior began, or what might have triggered it, but gives as an example some incidents described in a letter by Charles J. Woodbury to The Hartford Times in 1873. By 1879, according to a letter to the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot; from a Dr. L. P. Merideth, Morphy was talking to himself and responding to imaginary salutations.

Ernest Jones published an article of psychoanalytic discussion of Morphy. Reuben Fine published a longer article in which Morphy was mentioned. Both articles have been criticized for the use of unreliable historical sources.

Fine wrote that Morphy &quot;arranged women&#x27;s shoes into a semi-circle around his bed&quot;, and this has been widely copied and embellished upon. But it is a misquotation from a booklet written by Morphy&#x27;s niece, Regina Morphy-Voitier. She wrote: Now we come to the room which Paul Morphy occupied, and which was separated from his mother&#x27;s by a narrow hall. Morphy&#x27;s room was always kept in perfect order, for he was very particular and neat, yet this room had a peculiar aspect and at once struck the visitor as such, for Morphy had a dozen or more pairs of shoes of all kinds which he insisted in keeping arranged in a semi-circle in the middle of the room, explaining with his sarcastic smile that in this way, he could at once lay his hands on the particular pair he desired to wear. In a huge porte-manteau he kept all his clothes which were at all times neatly pressed and creased.
Fine incorrectly claimed that the shoes described were &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; shoes instead of Morphy&#x27;s own. But in any case, Hertan dismisses the psychoanalytical studies:

===Death===
On the afternoon of July 10, 1884, Morphy was found dead in his bathtub in New Orleans at the age of 47. The cause of death was described as congestion of the brain brought on by entering cold water after a long walk in the midday heat. A lifelong Catholic, Morphy was buried in the family tomb in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1, New Orleans, Louisiana. The mansion was sold by the family in 1891, and later became the site of the restaurant Brennan&#x27;s.

==Style of play==

With the White pieces, Morphy opted for 1.e4 except in a few games played at odds. He favored gambits such as the King&#x27;s Gambit and Evans Gambit. With the Black pieces, Morphy usually answered 1.e4 with 1...e5. In the Spanish Game, the Morphy Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6), the most popular response for Black, is named for him. When playing against 1.d4 as Black, he favored the Dutch Defense (1...f5), but also tried the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. In his notes to the games of the La Bourdonnais – McDonnell chess matches he criticized the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5) and Queen&#x27;s Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4); the only recorded instance of Morphy playing the Sicilian Defense as Black was during a game against Löwenthal in 1858. According to Garry Kasparov, 

Morphy approached the game more seriously than even his strongest contemporaries. As Anderssen noted, While Morphy generally played quickly, he &quot;knew also how to be slow, as in some of his match-games with Anderssen&quot;. Morphy played before the advent of time controls, and sometimes faced opponents who played very slowly. During the second game of their match in the First American Chess Congress finals, Paulsen required eleven hours for his moves.

Löwenthal and Anderssen both later remarked that Morphy was very hard to beat, since he knew how to defend well and would draw or even win games despite getting into bad positions. At the same time, he was deadly when given a promising position. Anderssen especially commented on this, saying that, after one bad move against Morphy, one might as well resign. Explaining his poor record facing Morphy, Anderssen said &quot;[Morphy] wins his games in Seventeen moves, and I in Seventy. But that is only natural&quot;.

==Legacy==
Garry Kasparov posited that Morphy&#x27;s historical merit lay in his realizing the relevance of three principles that would be vital in later analysis of the game: rapid , domination of the , and . These principles were only formulated in the theoretical work of Wilhelm Steinitz a quarter-century later. Kasparov maintained that Morphy can be considered both the &quot;forefather of modern chess&quot; and &quot;the first swallow – the prototype of the strong 20th-century grandmaster&quot;. World champions Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, and Max Euwe have stated that Morphy&#x27;s play was far ahead of its time. Euwe moreover described Morphy as &quot;a chess genius in the most complete sense of the term&quot;.

Bobby Fischer ranked Morphy among the ten greatest chess players of all time, and described him as &quot;perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived&quot;. He noted that &quot;Morphy [...] had enormous talent&quot;, and stated that he had the talent to defeat top players of any era. Reuben Fine disagreed with Fischer&#x27;s assessment: &quot;[Morphy&#x27;s] glorifiers went on to urge that he was the most brilliant genius who had ever appeared. [...] But if we examine Morphy&#x27;s record and games critically, we cannot justify such extravaganza. And we are compelled to speak of it as the Morphy myth. [...] He was so far ahead of his rivals that it is hard to find really outstanding examples of his skill... Even if the myth has been destroyed, Morphy remains one of the giants of chess history.&quot;

Morphy is mentioned in Walter Tevis&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, as well as in the 2020 miniseries adaptation produced by Netflix, as the favorite player of Beth Harmon, a chess prodigy and the novel&#x27;s protagonist. Morphy is also referenced in the 1955 James Bond novel &quot;Moonraker&quot; by Ian Fleming.

<text>A ganzfeld experiment (from the German words for &quot;entire&quot; and &quot;field&quot;) is an assessment used by parapsychologists that they contend can test for extrasensory perception (ESP) or telepathy. In these experiments, a &quot;sender&quot; attempts to mentally transmit an image to a &quot;receiver&quot; who is in a state of sensory deprivation. The receiver is normally asked to choose between a limited number of options for what the transmission was supposed to be and parapsychologists who propose that such telepathy is possible argue that rates of success above the expectation from randomness are evidence for ESP. Consistent, independent replication of ganzfeld experiments has not been achieved, and, in spite of strenuous arguments by parapsychologists to the contrary, there is no validated evidence accepted by the wider scientific community for the existence of any parapsychological phenomena. Ongoing parapsychology research using ganzfeld experiments has been criticized by independent reviewers as having the hallmarks of pseudoscience.

==Historical context==

The ganzfeld effect was originally introduced into experimental psychology due to the experiments of the German psychologist Wolfgang Metzger (1899–1979) who demonstrated that subjects who were presented with a homogeneous visual field would experience perceptual distortions that could rise to the level of hallucinations. In the early 1970s, Charles Honorton at the Maimonides Medical Center was trying to follow in the footsteps of psychical researchers such as Joseph Banks Rhine who had coined the term &quot;ESP&quot; to elevate the discourse around paranormal claims. Honorton focused on what he thought was the connection between ESP and dreams and began exposing his research subjects to the same sort of sensory deprivation that is used in demonstrations of the ganzfeld effect, hypothesizing that it was under such conditions that &quot;psi&quot; (a catch-all term used in parapsychology to denote anomalous psychic abilities) might work. Honorton believed that by reducing the ordinary sensory input, &quot;psi-conductive states&quot; would be enhanced and &quot;psi-mediated information&quot; could be more effectively transmitted.

Since the first full experiment was published by Honorton and Sharon Harper in the &quot;Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research&quot; in 1974, such &quot;ganzfeld experiments&quot; have remained a mainstay of parapsychological research.

==Experimental procedure==
In a typical Ganzfeld experiment, a &quot;receiver&quot; is placed in a room relaxing in a comfortable chair with halved ping-pong balls over the eyes, having a red light shone on them. The receiver also wears a set of headphones through which white or pink noise (static) is played. The receiver is in this state of mild sensory deprivation for half an hour. During this time, a &quot;sender&quot; observes a randomly chosen target and tries to mentally send this information to the receiver. The receiver speaks out loud during the 30 minutes, describing what they can &quot;see&quot;. The experimenter, who knows nothing of the chosen target, records these comments either on audiotape or through written notes.

Once time expires, the receiver is taken out of the Ganzfeld state and shown a set of possible targets, from which they select one which most resembles the images they witnessed. The receiver may refer to the notes/recordings made by the experimenter as needed. Most commonly there are three decoys along with the target, giving an expected rate of 25%, by chance, over several dozens of trials.

Some parapsychologists who accept the existence of psi have proposed that certain personality traits can enhance ESP performance. Such parapsychologists have argued that certain characteristics in the participants could be selected for that would increase the scores of ganzfeld experiments. Such traits have included the following:
* Positive belief in psi; ESP
* Prior psi experiences
* Practicing a mental discipline such as meditation
* Creativity
* Artistic ability
* Emotional closeness with the sender

Critics have pointed out that relying on selection criteria like this can introduce bias in the experimental design, and so generally discussion of any claimed effects has typically included only studies that sample normal populations rather than selecting for &quot;special&quot; participants (see below).

==Analysis of results==

===Early experiments===

Between 1974 and 1982, 42 ganzfeld experiments were performed by parapsychologists. In 1982, Charles Honorton presented a paper at the annual convention of the Parapsychological Association that presented his summary of the results of the ganzfeld experiments up to that date. Honorton concluded that the results represented sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of psi. Ray Hyman, a psychologist and noted critic of parapsychology, disagreed. Hyman criticized the ganzfeld experiment papers for not describing optimal protocols, nor including the appropriate statistical analysis. He identified three significant flaws, namely, flaws in randomization for choice of target; flaws in randomization in judging procedure; and insufficient documentation. The two men later independently analyzed the same studies, and both presented meta-analyses of them in 1985.

Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments, and, to assess each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six &quot;covered procedural flaws such as inadequate randomization, inadequate security, possibilities of sensory leakage, and inadequate documentation.&quot; Honorton himself had reported that only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. After considerable back-and-forth over the relevance and importance of the flaws, Honorton came to agree with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld experiments he had included in his 1982 meta-analysis could not in themselves support the claim for the existence of psi.

In 1986, Hyman and Honorton published &quot;A Joint Communiqué&quot; which agreed on the methodological problems and on ways to fix them. They suggested a computer-automated control, where randomization and the other methodological problems identified were eliminated. Hyman and Honorton agreed that replication of the studies was necessary before final conclusions could be drawn. They also agreed that more stringent standards were necessary for ganzfeld experiments, and they jointly specified what those standards should be.

===Autoganzfeld===
In 1982, Honorton had started a series of &quot;autoganzfeld experiments&quot;, that is ganzfeld experiments controlled by a computer, at his Psychophysical Research Laboratories (PRL). The trials continued until September 1989 and in 1990 Honorton &quot;et al&quot;. published the results of 11 autoganzfeld experiments they claimed met the standards specified by Hyman and Honorton (1986). In these experiments, 240 participants contributed 329 sessions.

Hyman analyzed these experiments and wrote they met most, but not all of the &quot;stringent standards&quot; of the joint communiqué. He expressed concerns with the randomization procedure, the reliability of which he was not able to confirm based on the data provided by Honorton&#x27;s collaborator, Daryl Bem. Hyman further noted that although the overall hit rate of 32% (7% higher than the 25% expectation from randomness) was significant, the hit rate for static targets (pictures) was, in fact, consistent with random and therefore inconsistent with Honorton&#x27;s previous claims of positive results from the ganzfeld experiments that were conducted prior to 1982. The significance of the results was due entirely to a new set of &quot;dynamic targets&quot; (videos) that participants were able to identify at a rate that was better than random. In the hit rates regarding these dynamic targets, however, patterns were evident that implied visual cues were leaked:

Hyman wrote these studies were an improvement over their older counterparts, but were not a successful replication of the ganzfeld experiments, nor a confirmation of psi. He concluded the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.

Richard Wiseman published a paper discussing a non-psi hypothesis based on possible sender to experimenter acoustic leakage in the autoganzfeld to account for the results. David Marks has written &quot;Wiseman and his colleagues identified various different ways in which knowledge of the target could have been leaked to the experimenter. These included cues from the videocassette recorder and sounds from the sender who, of course, knew the target&#x27;s identity... their conclusions provide little reassurance that sensory cueing of the experimenter was in any way substantially blocked.&quot;

Milton and Wiseman (1999) carried out a meta-analysis of ganzfeld experiments in other laboratories. They found no psi effect; the results showed no effect greater than chance from a database of 30 experiments and a non-significant Stouffer Z of 0.70.

Lance Storm and Suitbert Ertel (2001) published a meta-analysis of 79 studies published between 1974 and 1996 and concluded the positive statistically significant overall outcome indicates a psi effect. In response, Milton and Wiseman (2001) wrote the meta-analysis of Storm and Ertel was not an accurate quantitative summary of ganzfeld research as they had included early studies which had been widely recognized as having methodological problems which make it impossible to interpret the results as evidence of a psi effect.

Another meta-analysis was conducted by Daryl Bem, John Palmer, and Richard Broughton in which the experiments were sorted according to how closely they adhered to a pre-existing description of the ganzfeld procedure including some experiments that had been published in the time since Milton and Wiseman&#x27;s deadline. They obtained results that were significant with a Stouffer Z of 2.59, but their detractors maintained their selection of studies for inclusion was problematic.

===Contemporary research===
The ganzfeld experiment has continued to be refined over the years. In its current incarnation, an automated computer system is used to select and display the targets (&quot;digital autoganzfeld&quot;). This has the potential to overcome some of the shortcomings of earlier experimental setups, such as randomization and experimenter blindness with respect to the targets.

In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with p &lt; .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm &quot;et al&quot;. concluding that the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and had thus failed to produce evidence for psi. According to Hyman, &quot;reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence.&quot; Storm &quot;et al&quot;. published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder &quot;et al&quot;. in 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for psi, no plausible mechanism, and omitted replication failures.

A 2016 paper examined questionable research practices in the ganzfeld experiments and simulated how such practices could cause erroneous positive results.

==Criticism==

There are several common criticisms of some or all of the ganzfeld experiments:
* &quot;Isolation&quot; – Richard Wiseman and others argue that not all of the studies used soundproof rooms, so it is possible that when videos were playing, the experimenter could have heard it, and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process. It could even have been possible that the receiver themselves could hear the video.
* &quot;Randomization&quot; – When subjects are asked to choose from a variety of selections, there is an inherent bias to choose the first selection they are shown. If the order in which they are shown the selections is randomized each time, this bias will be averaged out. The randomization procedures used in the experiment have been criticized for not randomizing satisfactorily.
* &quot;The psi assumption&quot; – The assumption that any statistical deviation from chance is evidence for telepathy is highly controversial. Strictly speaking, a deviation from chance is only evidence that either this was a rare, statistically unlikely occurrence that happened by chance, or &quot;something&quot; was causing a deviation from chance. Flaws in the experimental design are a common cause of this, and so the assumption that it must be telepathy is fallacious.

Writing in 1985, C. E. M. Hansel discovered weaknesses in the design and possibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments reported by Carl Sargent and other parapsychologists. Hansel concluded the ganzfeld studies had not been independently replicated and that &quot;ESP is no nearer to being established than it was a hundred years ago.&quot;

David Marks in his book &quot;The Psychology of the Psychic&quot; (2000) has noted that during the autoganzfeld experiments the experimenter sat only fourteen feet from the sender&#x27;s room. Soundproofing tiles were eventually added but they were designed to &quot;absorb sound not to prevent transmission.&quot; According to Marks this was inadequate and no different than using any standard internal wall. The door and door frame were also a possible source of sensory leakage and none of these problems were ever eliminated.

Terence Hines wrote in 2003 that the ganzfeld studies could not be said to provide evidence for psi as the alleged evidence disappears as the tightness of experimental controls is increased. As research progresses variables in science become clearer as more studies are published that describe under what specific condition the particular effect can be demonstrated. This is in opposition to the ganzfeld studies. According to Hines, there was &quot;no clear way to obtain results showing any psychic phenomenon reliably&quot; and that &quot;the most reasonable conclusion&quot; was that the effect did not exist and had never existed.

In a 2007 review, Ray Hyman wrote that parapsychologists agree they have no positive theory of psi as it is negatively defined as any effect that cannot be currently explained in terms of chance or normal causes. Hyman saw this as a fallacy, as it encouraged parapsychologists to use any peculiarity in the data as a characteristic of psi. Hyman also wrote that parapsychologists have admitted it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of non-paranormal causes in the ganzfeld experiment. There is no independent method to indicate the presence or absence of psi.

In their book &quot;50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology&quot; (2011), Scott O. Lilienfeld and colleagues have written that the ganzfeld being a reliable technique is far from being resolved. They concluded that ESP has not been successfully demonstrated in experiments for over 150 years so this is hardly encouraging.

In a 2013 podcast, Brian Dunning reviewed the flaws of the ganzfeld studies and came to the conclusion the technique had failed as evidence for psi and interest in ganzfeld has declined.

== Controversy ==

In 1979, Susan Blackmore visited the laboratories of Carl Sargent in Cambridge. She noticed a number of irregularities in the procedure and wrote about them for the &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;.

This article, along with further criticisms of Sargent&#x27;s work from Adrian Parker and Nils Wiklund remained unpublished until 1987 but all were well known in parapsychological circles. Sargent wrote a rebuttal to these criticisms (also not published until 1987) in which he did not deny what Blackmore had observed, but argued that her conclusions based on those observations were wrong and prejudiced. His co-workers also responded, saying that any deviation from protocol was the result of &quot;random errors&quot; rather than any concerted attempt at fraud. Carl Sargent stopped working in parapsychology after this and did not respond &quot;in a timely fashion&quot; when the Council of the Parapsychological Association asked for his data, and so his membership of that organization was allowed to lapse.

Writing for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; in 2018, Blackmore states that Sargent &quot;deliberately violated his own protocols and in one trial had almost certainly cheated.&quot; Psychologists reading Daryl Bem&#x27;s review in &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; would &quot;not have a clue that serious doubt had been cast on more than a quarter of the studies involved&quot;. When Blackmore confronted Sargent, he told her &quot;it wouldn&#x27;t matter if some experiments were unreliable because, after all, we know that psi exists&quot;. Blackmore also recounts having a discussion with Bem at a consciousness conference where she challenged him on his support of Sargent and Honorton&#x27;s research, he replied &quot;it did not matter&quot;. Blackmore writes, &quot;But it does matter. ... It matters because Bem&#x27;s continued claims mislead a willing public into believing that there is reputable scientific evidence for ESP in the Ganzfeld when there is not&quot;.

<doc id="89775" wikidata="Q170538" url="?curid=89775" title="Virginity">
<text>Virginity is the state of a person who has never engaged in sexual intercourse; it is considered a social construct, not an objective term with an operational definition. Social definitions of virginity therefore vary. Heterosexual individuals may or may not consider loss of virginity to occur only through penile-vaginal penetration, while people of other sexual orientations often include oral sex, anal sex, or manual sex in their definitions of losing one&#x27;s virginity. The term &quot;virgin&quot; encompasses a range of definitions, as found in traditional, modern and ethical concepts. Religious rituals for regaining virginity exist in many cultures. Some men and women consider themselves born-again virgins.

There are cultural and religious traditions that place special value and significance on this state, predominantly towards unmarried females, associated with notions of personal purity, honor, and worth. Like chastity, the concept of virginity has traditionally involved sexual abstinence. The concept of virginity usually involves moral or religious issues and can have consequences in terms of social status and in interpersonal relationships. Although virginity has social implications and had significant legal implications in some societies in the past, it has no legal consequences in most societies today. The social implications of virginity still remain in many societies and can have varying effects on an individual&#x27;s social agency.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;virgin&quot; comes via Old French &quot;virgine&quot; from the root form of Latin , genitive , meaning literally &quot;maiden&quot; or &quot;virgin&quot; The words (“female virgin”) and (literally &quot;virgin person&quot; but often used for a male virgin) are hyponyms.

The Latin word likely arose by analogy with a suit of lexemes based on , meaning &quot;to be green, fresh or flourishing&quot;, mostly with botanic reference—in particular, meaning &quot;strip of wood&quot;. 

The first known use of &quot;virgin&quot; in English is found in a Middle English manuscript held at Trinity College, Cambridge of about 1200:

In this, and many later contexts, the reference is specifically Christian, alluding to members of the Ordo Virginum (Order of Virgins), which applies to the consecrated virgins known to have existed since the early church from the writings of the Church Fathers.

By about 1300, the word was expanded to apply also to Mary, the mother of Jesus, hence to sexual virginity explicitly:

Further expansion of the word to include virtuous (or naïve) young women, irrespective of religious connection, occurred over about another century, until by about 1400 we find:

These are three of the eighteen definitions of &quot;virgin&quot; from the first edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED1&quot;, pages 230–232). Most of the &quot;OED1&quot; definitions, however, are similar.

The German word for &quot;virgin&quot; is . literally means &quot;young woman&quot;, but is not used in this sense anymore. Instead can be used. is the word reserved specifically for sexual inexperience. As means &quot;woman&quot;, it suggests a female referent. Unlike English, German also has a specific word for a male virgin &quot;(Youngling)&quot;. It is, however, dated and rarely used. , with some masculine modifier, is more typical, as evidenced by the film &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, about a 40-year-old male virgin, titled in German, . German also distinguishes between young women and girls, who are denoted by the word . The English cognate &quot;maid&quot; was often used to imply virginity, especially in poetry – e.g. Maid Marian, the love interest of the legendary outlaw Robin Hood in English folklore.

German is not the only language to have a specific name for male virginity; in French, a male virgin is called a &quot;&quot;.

The Greek word for &quot;virgin&quot; is &quot;parthenos&quot; (, see Parthenon). Although typically applied to women, like English, it is also applied to men, in both cases specifically denoting absence of sexual experience. When used of men, it does not carry a strong association of &quot;never-married&quot; status. However, in reference to women, historically, it was sometimes used to refer to an engaged woman—&quot;parthenos autou&quot; (παρθένος αὐτού, his virgin) = his fiancée as opposed to &quot;gunē autou&quot; (γυνή αὐτού, his woman) = his wife. This distinction is necessary due to there being no specific word for wife (or husband) in Greek. By extension from its primary sense, the idea that a virgin has a sexual &quot;blank slate&quot;, unchanged by any past intimate connection or experience, can imply that the person is of unadulterated purity.

The English sense is not retricted to youth or females; older women can be virgins (the Virgin Queen), men can be virgins, and potential initiates into many fields can be colloquially termed &quot;virgins&quot;; for example, a skydiving &quot;virgin&quot;. In the latter usage, &quot;virgin&quot; means uninitiated, as in the much older &quot;virgin knight&quot;. &quot;Virgin&quot; is also used as an adjective in terms like &quot;virgin field&quot;.

==Culture==
===Concept===
The concept of virginity has significance only in a particular social, cultural or moral context. According to Hanne Blank, &quot;virginity reflects no known biological imperative and grants no demonstrable evolutionary advantage.&quot;

Medieval bestiaries stated that the only way to capture or tame a unicorn was by way of using a virgin as a lure, due to her implied purity. The topic is popular in Renaissance paintings.

Although virginity has historically been correlated with purity and worth, many feminist scholars believe that virginity itself is a myth. They argue that no standardized medical definition of virginity exists, that there is no scientifically verifiable proof of virginity loss, and that sexual intercourse results in no change in personality. Jessica Valenti, feminist writer and author of &quot;The Purity Myth&quot;, reasons that the concept of virginity is also dubious because of the many individual definitions of virginity loss, and that valuing virginity has placed a woman&#x27;s morality &quot;between her legs.&quot; She critiques the notion that sexual activity has any influence on morality or ethics.

The urge of wanting one&#x27;s spouse or partner to have never engaged in sexual activities is called a virgin complex. A person may also have a virgin complex directed towards oneself.

===Definitions of virginity loss===
There are varying understandings as to which types of sexual activities result in loss of virginity. The traditional view is that virginity is only lost through vaginal penetration by the penis, consensual or non-consensual, and that acts of oral sex, anal sex, manual sex or other forms of non-penetrative sex do not result in loss of virginity. A person who engages in such acts without having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as &quot;technically a virgin&quot;. By contrast, gay or lesbian individuals often describe such acts as resulting in loss of virginity. Some gay males regard penile-anal penetration as resulting in loss of virginity, but not fellatio, handjobs or other types of non-penetrative sex, while lesbians may regard cunnilingus or fingering as virginity loss. Some lesbians who debate the traditional definition consider whether or not non-penile forms of vaginal penetration constitute virginity loss, while other gay men and lesbians assert that the term &quot;virginity&quot; is meaningless to them because of the prevalence of the traditional definition.

Whether a person can lose their virginity through rape is also subject to debate, with the belief that virginity can only be lost through consensual sex being prevalent in some studies. In a study by researcher and author Laura M. Carpenter, many men and women discussed how they felt virginity could not be taken through rape. They described losing their virginities in one of three ways: &quot;as a gift, stigma or part of the process.&quot;

Carpenter states that despite perceptions of what determines virginity loss being as varied among gay men and lesbians as they are among heterosexuals, and in some cases more varied among the former, that the matter has been described to her as people viewing sexual acts relating to virginity loss as &quot;acts that correspond to your sexual orientation,&quot; which suggests the following: &quot;So if you&#x27;re a gay male, you&#x27;re supposed to have anal sex because that&#x27;s what gay men do. And if you&#x27;re a gay woman, then you&#x27;re supposed to have oral sex, because that&#x27;s what gay women do. And so those become, like markers, for when virginity is lost.&quot;

The concept of &quot;technical virginity&quot; or sexual abstinence through oral sex is popular among teenagers. For example, oral sex is common among adolescent girls who fellate their boyfriends not only to preserve their virginity, but also to create and maintain intimacy or to avoid pregnancy. In a 1999 study published in &quot;JAMA&quot; (the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;), the definition of &quot;sex&quot; was examined based on a 1991 random sample of 599 college students from 29 US states; it found that 60% said oral-genital contact (like fellatio, cunnilingus) did not constitute having sex. Stephanie Sanders of the Kinsey Institute, co-author of the study, stated, &quot;That&#x27;s the &#x27;technical virginity&#x27; thing that&#x27;s going on.&quot; She and other researchers titled their findings &quot;Would You Say You &#x27;Had Sex&#x27; If ...?&quot; By contrast, in a study released in 2008 by the Guttmacher Institute, author of the findings Laura Lindberg stated that there &quot;is a widespread belief that teens engage in nonvaginal forms of sex, especially oral sex, as a way to be sexually active while still claiming that technically, they are virgins&quot;, but that her study drew the conclusion that &quot;research shows that this supposed substitution of oral sex for vaginal sex is largely a myth&quot;.

A 2003 study published in the &quot;Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality&quot; focusing on definitions of &quot;having sex&quot; and noting studies concerning university students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia reported that &quot;[w]hile the vast majority of respondents (more than 97%) in these three studies included penile-vaginal intercourse in their definition of sex, fewer (between 70% and 90%) respondents considered penile-anal intercourse to constitute having sex&quot; and that &quot;oral-genital behaviours were defined as sex by between 32% and 58% of respondents&quot;. A different study by the Kinsey Institute sampled 484 people, ranging in ages 18–96. &quot;Nearly 95 percent of people in the study agreed that penile-vaginal intercourse meant &#x27;had sex.&#x27; But the numbers changed as the questions got more specific.&quot; 11 percent of respondents based &quot;had sex&quot; on whether the man had achieved an orgasm, concluding that absence of an orgasm does not constitute &quot;having had&quot; sex. &quot;About 80 percent of respondents said penile-anal intercourse meant &#x27;had sex.&#x27; About 70 percent of people believed oral sex was sex.&quot;

Virginity pledges (or abstinence pledges) made by heterosexual teenagers and young adults may also include the practice of &quot;technical virginity&quot;. In a peer-reviewed study by sociologists Peter Bearman and Hannah Brueckner, which looked at virginity pledgers five years after their pledge, they found that the pledgers have similar proportions of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and at least as high proportions of anal and oral sex as those who have not made a virginity pledge, and deduced that there was substitution of oral and anal sex for vaginal sex among the pledgers. However, the data for anal sex without vaginal sex reported by males did not reflect this directly.

=== Early loss of virginity ===

Early loss of virginity has been shown to be linked to factors such as level of education, independence, biological factors like age and gender, and social factors such as parental supervision or religious affiliation, with the most common being sociodemographic variables. Along with this, sexual abuse has also been shown to have a link to later risky sexual behaviors and a younger age of voluntary sexual intercourse. Sexual initiation at an earlier age has been associated with reduced frequency of condom use, less satisfaction and more frequency of non-autonomous reasons for that first sexual encounter. Adverse effects for losing virginity at an early age include lower chance of economic stability, lower level of education, social isolation, marital disruption and greater medical consequences. These medical consequences consist of an increase in STDs, cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, fertility and unwanted pregnancies.

===Female virginity===

====Cultural value====

The first act of sexual intercourse by a female is commonly considered within many cultures to be an important personal milestone. Its significance is reflected in expressions such as &quot;saving oneself&quot;, &quot;losing one&#x27;s virginity,&quot; &quot;taking someone&#x27;s virginity&quot; and sometimes as &quot;deflowering&quot;. The occasion is at times seen as the end of innocence, integrity, or purity, and the sexualization of the individual.

Traditionally, there was a cultural expectation that a female would not engage in premarital sex and would come to her wedding a virgin and that she would &quot;give up&quot; her virginity to her new husband in the act of consummation of the marriage. Feminine sexual practices have revolved around the idea of females waiting to have sex until they are married.

Some females who have been previously sexually active (or their hymen has been otherwise damaged) may undergo a surgical procedure, called hymenorrhaphy or hymenoplasty, to repair or replace her hymen, and cause vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse as proof of virginity (see below). In some cultures, an unmarried female who is found not to be a virgin, whether by choice or as a result of a rape, can be subject to shame, ostracism or even an honor killing. In those cultures, female virginity is closely interwoven with personal or even family honor, especially those known as shame societies, in which the loss of virginity before marriage is a matter of deep shame. In some parts of Africa, the myth that sex with a virgin can cure HIV/AIDS continues to prevail, leading to girls and women being raped. In other societies, such as many modern-day Western cultures, lack of sexual abstinence before marriage is not as socially stigmatized as it may be in the formerly mentioned cultures. Conversely, Western societies see premarital abstinence as prude or outdated, while encouraging and sometimes even pressuring virgin individuals into sexual encounters.

Virginity is regarded as a valuable commodity in some cultures. In the past, within most societies a woman&#x27;s options for marriage were largely dependent upon her status as a virgin. Those women who were not virgins experienced a dramatic decrease in opportunities for a socially advantageous marriage, and in some instances the premarital loss of virginity eliminated their chances of marriage entirely. Modern virginity auctions, like that of Natalie Dylan, are discussed in the 2013 documentary &quot;How to Lose Your Virginity.&quot;

The Bible required a man who had sex with a virgin to pay her bride price to her father and marry the girl. In some countries, until the late 20th century, a woman could sue a man who had taken her virginity but did not marry her. In some languages, the compensation for these damages are called &quot;wreath money&quot;.

====&quot;Proof of virginity&quot;====
Despite common cultural beliefs, links between hymen state and vaginal penetration are not clear-cut. Inserting objects (including penises) into the vagina may or may not affect the hymen. The state of a hymen cannot be used to prove or disprove virginity. Penile penetration does not lead to predictable changes to female genital organs; after puberty, hymens are highly elastic and can stretch during penetration without trace of injury. Females with a confirmed history of sexual abuse involving genital penetration may have normal hymens. Young females who say they have had consensual sex mostly show no identifiable changes in the hymen. Hymens rarely completely cover the vagina, hymens naturally have irregularities in width, and hymens can heal spontaneously without scarring. Visible breaks in the hymen, including complete hymenal clefts, are also common in girls and women who have never been sexually active.

Medical professionals therefore recommend against describing hymens as &quot;intact&quot; or &quot;broken&quot;.

Some cultures require proof of a bride&#x27;s virginity before her marriage. This has traditionally been tested by inspection for an &quot;intact&quot; hymen, or by a &quot;proof of blood&quot;, which refers to vaginal bleeding wrongly believed to be caused by the tearing of the hymen after the first sanctioned sexual contact. Coerced medical virginity tests are practiced in many regions of the world, but are today condemned as a form of abuse of women. According to the World Health Organization (WHO): &quot;Sexual violence encompasses a wide range of acts including (...) violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and &quot;obligatory inspections for virginity&quot;&quot;.

Although it is not actually possible to determine virginity by inspection, some doctors feel socially pressured into performing &quot;virginity testing&quot; inspections and providing &quot;certificates of virginity&quot;. In some jurisdictions, this is illegal, and physicians are encouraged to instead provide education, guidance, social support, and where needed, physical protection. Such virginity-testing bans have been controversial; while there is a consensus that virginity cannot be scientifically and medically certified, some physicians argue that certificates, while intrinsically dishonest, protect vulnerable women from potentially life-threatening danger.

Some women undergo hymenorrhaphy (or hymenoplasty) to reshape their hymens with the intent of causing vaginal bleeding on the next intercourse. Hymenorraphy is based on the false belief that all women bleed when first having vaginal intercourse; in fact, only about half bleed. In some cultures, the nuptial blood-spotted bed sheet would be displayed as proof of both consummation of marriage and that the bride had been a virgin. Hymens have few blood vessels and may not bleed significantly even when torn, and vaginal walls may bleed significantly when torn. Blood on the sheets on first intercourse is more likely to be due to lacerations to the vaginal wall caused by inadequate vaginal lubrication or forced penetration. A small study found that of 19 women who underwent hymenorrhaphy, 17 did not have bleeding at the next intercourse. 

In Iran, Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Sadeq Rohani has issued a fatwa which states that a women, after undergoing hymenorrhaphy, is a virgin, and a man cannot divorce her on grounds that she was not. Hymenorraphy is considered a form of cosmetic surgery, and is not generally accepted, taught, or regulated by the medical profession. 

There is a common belief that some women are born without a hymen, but some doubt has been cast on this by a recent study. It is likely that almost all women are born with a hymen, but most will not experience a measurable change during first experience of vaginal intercourse. Some medical procedures occasionally may require a woman&#x27;s hymen to be opened (hymenotomy).

===Male virginity===
Historically, and in modern times, female virginity has been regarded as more significant than male virginity; the perception that sexual prowess is fundamental to masculinity has lowered the expectation of male virginity without lowering social status. For example, in Mataram, Indonesia, where around 80% of the population are Muslims, unmarried women who are not virgins may be subject to name-calling, shunning, or family shame, while unmarried men who have lost their virginities are not, though premarital sex is forbidden in the Quran with regard to both men and women. Among various countries or cultures, males are expected or encouraged to want to engage in sexual activity, and to be more sexually experienced. Not following these standards often leads to teasing and other such ridicule from their male peers. A 2003 study by the Guttmacher Institute showed that in the countries surveyed, most men have experienced sexual intercourse by their 20th birthdays.

Male sexuality is seen as something that is innate and competitive and displays a different set of cultural values and stigmas from female sexuality and virginity. In one study, scholars Wenger and Berger found that male virginity is understood to be real by society, but it has been ignored by sociological studies. Within British and American culture in particular, male virginity has been made an object of embarrassment and ridicule in films such as &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, &quot;The Inbetweeners Movie&quot; and &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, with the male virgin typically being presented as socially inept. Such attitudes have resulted in some men keeping their status as a virgin a secret.

===Prevalence of virginity===
The prevalence of virginity varies from culture to culture. In cultures which place importance on a female&#x27;s virginity at marriage, the age at which virginity is lost is in effect determined by the age at which marriages would normally take place in those cultures, as well as the minimum marriage age set by the laws of the country where the marriage takes place.

In a cross-cultural study, &quot;At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?&quot; (2003), Michael Bozon of the French Institut national d&#x27;études démographiques found that contemporary cultures fall into three broad categories. In the first group, the data indicated families arranging marriage for daughters as close to puberty as possible with significantly older men. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital. This group included sub-Saharan Africa (the study listed Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia). The study considered the Indian subcontinent to also fall into this group, although data was only available from Nepal.

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women. This group includes Latin cultures, both from southern Europe (Portugal, Greece and Romania are noted) and from Latin America (Brazil, Chile, and the Dominican Republic). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from Thailand.

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched. There were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries (Poland and Lithuania are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in Singapore and Sri Lanka. The study considered China and Vietnam to also fall into this group, although data were not available.

Finally, in northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual activity before any union formation. The study listed Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic as members of this group.

According to a 2001 UNICEF survey, in 10 out of 12 developed nations with available data, more than two thirds of young people have had sexual intercourse while still in their teens. In Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, approximately 25% of 15-year-olds and 50% of 17-year-olds have had sex. A 2002 international survey sought to study the sexual behavior of teenagers. 33,943 students aged 15, from 24 countries, completed a self-administered, anonymous, classroom survey, consisting of a standard questionnaire, developed by the HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children) international research network. The survey revealed that the majority of the students were still virgins (they had no experience of sexual intercourse), and, among those who were sexually active, the majority (82%) used contraception. In a 2005 Kaiser Family Foundation study of US teenagers, 29% of teens reported feeling pressure to have sex, 33% of sexually active teens reported &quot;being in a relationship where they felt things were moving too fast sexually&quot;, and 24% had &quot;done something sexual they didn&#x27;t really want to do&quot;. Several polls have indicated peer pressure as a factor in encouraging both girls and boys to have sex.

Some studies suggest that people commence sexual activity at an earlier age than previous generations. The 2005 Durex Global sex survey found that people worldwide are having sex for the first time at an average age of 17.3, ranging from 15.6 in Iceland to 19.8 in India (though evidence has shown that the average age is not a good indicator of sexual initiation, and that percentages of sexually initiated youth at each age are preferred). A 2008 survey of UK teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 (conducted by YouGov for Channel 4), showed that only 6% of these teenagers intended to wait until marriage before having sex. According to a 2011 CDC study, in the 15-to-19-year-old age group 43 percent of males and 48 percent of females in the United States reported never having an opposite-sex partner.

The rates of teenage pregnancy vary and range from 143 per 1000 girls in some sub-Saharan African countries to 2.9 per 1000 in South Korea. The rate for the United States is 52.1 per 1000, the highest in the developed world – and about four times the European Union average. The teenage pregnancy rates between countries must take into account the level of general sex education available and access to contraceptive options. Many Western countries have instituted sex education programs, the main objective of which is to reduce such pregnancies and STDs. In 1996, the United States federal government shifted the objective of sex education towards &quot;abstinence-only sex education&quot; programs, promoting sexual abstinence before marriage (i.e., virginity) and prohibiting information on birth control and contraception. In 2004, President George W. Bush announced a Five-Year Global HIV/AIDS Strategy, also known as the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which committed the U.S. to provide $15 billion over five years toward AIDS relief in 15 countries in Africa and the Caribbean, and in Vietnam. A part of the funding was earmarked specifically for &quot;abstinence-only-until-marriage&quot; programs.

In one study about virginity pledges, male pledgers were 4.1 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (25% vs 6%), and estimated that female pledgers were 3.5 times more likely to remain virgins by age 25 than those who did not pledge (21% vs 6%).

===Social psychology===
Some cultural anthropologists argue that romantic love and sexual jealousy are universal features of human relationships. Social values related to virginity reflect both sexual jealousy and ideals of romantic love, and appear to be deeply embedded in human nature.

Psychology explores the connection between thought and behavior. Seeking understanding of social (or anti-social) behaviors includes sexual behavior. Joan Kahn and Kathryn London studied U.S. women married between 1965 and 1985 to see if virginity at marriage influenced risk of divorce. In this study, women who were virgins at the time of marriage were shown to have less marital upset. It was shown that when observable characteristics were controlled, women who were non-virgins at the time of marriage had a higher risk for divorce. However, it was also shown that the link between premarital sex and the risk of divorce were attributed to prior unobserved differences, such as deviating from norms.

A study conducted by Smith and Schaffer found that someone&#x27;s first sexual experience has been linked to their sexual performance for years to come. Participants whose first intercourse was pleasant showed more satisfaction in their current sex lives. A different study showed that when compared with virgins, nonvirgins have been shown to have higher levels of independence, less desire for achievement, more criticism from society and a greater level of deviance.

== Ethics ==

=== Social norms and legal implications ===

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as sexual morality (what can and can not be done by society&#x27;s rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected). There are a number of groups within societies promoting their views of sexual morality in a variety of ways, including through sex education, religious teachings, seeking commitments or virginity pledges, and other means.

Most countries have laws which set a minimum marriage age, with the most common age being 18 years, reduced to 16 in &quot;special circumstances&quot;, typically when the female partner is pregnant, but the actual age at first marriage can be considerably higher. Laws also prescribe the minimum age at which a person is permitted to engage in sex, commonly called the age of consent. Social (and legal) attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example, while ages from 10 to 13 were typically acceptable in Western countries during the mid-19th century, the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing attitudes resulting in raising the ages of consent to ages generally ranging from 16 to 18. Today, the age of consent varies from 12 years (or onset of puberty) to 21, but 16 is the most common age of consent, though some jurisdictions also having a &quot;close-in-age&quot; exception, allowing two adolescents (as young as 12 years of age) to have sex with each other provided their ages are not more than a specified number of years apart (typical no more than a 2 to 3 years age difference, depending on the jurisdiction). Some countries outlaw any sex outside marriage entirely.

Historically, and still in many countries and jurisdictions today, a female&#x27;s sexual experience is sometimes considered a relevant factor in the prosecution of a perpetrator of rape. Also, historically, a man who &quot;took&quot; a female&#x27;s virginity could be forced to marry her. In addition, children born as a result of premarital sex were subject to various legal and social disabilities such as being considered illegitimate and thus barred from inheriting from the putative father&#x27;s estate, from bearing the father&#x27;s surname or title, and support from the putative father. Many of these legal disabilities on children born from extramarital relationships have been abolished by law in most Western countries, though social ostracism may still apply.

===Religious views===
All major religions have moral codes covering issues of sexuality, morality, and ethics. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people&#x27;s sexual activities and practices. However, the impact of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of premarital sexual relations, it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples&#x27; attitudes to sexual issues.

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
Virginity was often considered a virtue denoting purity and physical self-restraint and is an important characteristic in Greek mythology.

In ancient Greek literature such as the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, there are references to the Parthenon goddesses Artemis, Athena, and Hestia proclaiming pledges to eternal virginity (Greek: παρθενία). However, it has been argued a maiden&#x27;s state of &quot;parthenia&quot; (Greek: παρθένος), as invoked by these deities, carries a slightly different meaning from what is normally understood as virginity in modern western religions. Rather, &quot;parthenia&quot; focused more on marriageability and abstract concepts without strict physical requirements which would be adversely affected, but not entirely relinquished, by pre-marital sexual intercourse. For these reasons, other goddesses not eternally committed to &quot;parthenia&quot; within the Homeric Hymns are able to renew theirs through ritual (such as Hera) or choose an appearance which implies the possession of it (such as Aphrodite). Although accounts vary, the goddess of witchcraft known as Hecate has been portrayed as a virgin as well.

In Roman times, the Vestal Virgins were the highly respected, strictly celibate (although not necessarily virginal) priestesses of Vesta, and keepers of the sacred fire of Vesta. The Vestals were committed to the priesthood before puberty (when 6–10 years old) and sworn to celibacy for a period of 30 years. The chastity of the Vestals was considered to have a direct bearing on the health of the Roman state. Allowing the sacred fire of Vesta to die out, suggesting that the goddess had withdrawn her protection from the city, was a serious offence and was punishable by scourging. Because a Vestal&#x27;s chastity was thought to be directly correlated to the sacred burning of the fire, if the fire were extinguished it might be assumed that a Vestal had been unchaste. The penalty for a Vestal Virgin found to have had sexual relations while in office was being buried alive.

====Buddhism====
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics for lay followers are the Five Precepts and the Eightfold Path. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Five Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing sensual misconduct&quot;. Sensual misconduct is defined in the Pali Canon as follows:

Virginity, specifically, is not mentioned in the Canon. On the other hand, Buddhist monks and nuns of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and the Buddha is said to have admonished his followers to avoid unchastity &quot;as if it were a pit of burning cinders.&quot;

The 3rd of the 5 precepts in Buddhism warns against any sensual misconduct, though the exact definition of it is unclear. Buddhists have been more open compared to other religions about the subject of sex and that has expanded over time. As with Christianity, although a traditionalist would assume that one should not have sex before marriage, many Buddhists do. There are different branches of Buddhism, like tantric and puritan, and they have very different views on the subject of sex, yet managed to get along. Tantric is a Sanskrit word; it is typically translated as two things or person being bound together. In the time of Gotama, the man who came to be known as Buddha, sex was not taboo. The world the prince lived in was filled with earthly pleasures. Women naked from the waist above were in the court solely to serve the prince. Gotama&#x27;s father even constructed a chamber of love. Prince Gotama and founded the beginnings of Buddhism, which included the denial of earthly pleasures in order to follow the Middle Way. The stark contrast between the way Buddha lived his life before and after rejecting the material world may arguably be one of the reasons Buddhism evolved the way it did. In the present, the mother of a Buddha does not have to be a virgin; she must have never had a child, however.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism, premarital virginity on the part of the bride is considered ideal. The prevailing Hindu marriage ceremony, or the Vedic wedding, centers around the &quot;Kanyadan&quot; ritual, which literally means &quot;gift of a virgin,&quot; by father of the maiden through which the Hindus believe they gain greatest spiritual merit, and marriages of the daughters are considered a spiritual obligation. The purity of women is especially valued in South Asia, where Hinduism is most commonly practiced. Sex had never been a taboo in ancient India and intactness of the hymen had nothing to do with virginity.

====Judaism====

Premarital sex is forbidden in Judaism. In fact, the precedent for the &quot;mitzvot&quot; which are related in Deuteronomy 22:25-29, which regard what happens when a man rapes a virgin, may well have been set at Shechem after the rape of Dinah (cf. Genesis 34).

There are other references in the Torah to virginity. In the first reference, in , Lot offers his virgin daughters to the people of Sodom for sexual purposes in an attempt to protect his guests (cf. Genesis 19:4-11), with the implication that the people of Sodom would be more likely to accept the offer in view of the girls&#x27; virginity than they would otherwise. This also sets the precedent for Israelites to avoid homosexual activity (cf. Leviticus 18:22, 20:13.).

The next reference is at , where Eliezer is seeking a wife for his master, Abraham&#x27;s son. He meets Rebecca, and the narrative tells us, &quot;the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her&quot; (in biblical terms, &quot;to know&quot; is a euphemism for sexual relations).

Children born to a single woman are not regarded as illegitimate (a &quot;mamzer&quot;) or subject to social or religious disabilities—Perez and Zerach, for example (and although their mother was a widow who was willingly impregnated by her father-in-law), were not counted as &quot;mamzerim&quot; (cf. Genesis 38:24-30).

Halakhah also contains rules related to protecting female virgins, and rules regarding pre-marital sex, rape, and the effects of each.

In Torah, a damsel who has not the sign of virginity in the early marriage shall be punished by death penalty, since the unvirgin woman among Israel is equal with a defiled whore in her father&#x27;s house.

====Christianity====

Paul the Apostle expressed the view that a person&#x27;s body belongs to God and is God&#x27;s temple (, ), and that premarital sex is immoral () on an equal level as adultery. () Paul also expressed the view in that sexual abstinence is the preferred state for both men and women. However, he stated that sexual relations are expected between a married couple.

According to classicist Evelyn Stagg and New Testament scholar Frank Stagg, the New Testament holds that sex is reserved for marriage. Harold Gentry wrote that &quot;It is intended by God for the husband to be the one to break his wife&#x27;s hymen&quot;, which when perforated during the consummation of marriage creates a blood covenant that seals the bond of holy matrimony between husband and wife. Stagg maintains that the New Testament teaches that sex outside of marriage is a sin of adultery if either of the participants is married, otherwise the sin of fornication if neither of the participants are married. An imperative given in 1 Corinthians says, &quot;Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins people commit are outside their bodies, but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies.&quot; Those who are sexually immoral or adulterers are listed in in a list of &quot;wrongdoers who ... will not inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; and also address fornication. The &quot;Apostolic Decree&quot; of the Council of Jerusalem also includes a prohibition on fornication. 

Aquinas went further, emphasizing that acts other than copulation destroy virginity, and clarifying that involuntary sexual pleasure does not destroy virginity. From his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, &quot;Pleasure resulting from resolution of semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the mind&#x27;s purpose, it destroys virginity, &quot;whether copulation takes place or not&quot;. Augustine, however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary and natural result thereof. On another way this may happen beside the purpose of the mind, either during sleep, or through violence and without the mind&#x27;s consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again through weakness of nature, as in the case of those who are subject to a flow of semen. On such cases virginity is not forfeit, because such like pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes virginity.&quot;
Some have theorized that the New Testament was not against sex before marriage. The discussion turns on two Greek words — &quot;moicheia&quot; (&quot;μοιχεία&quot;, adultery) and &quot;porneia&quot; (&quot;πορνεία&quot;, fornication, see also pornography). The first word is restricted to contexts involving sexual betrayal of a spouse; however, the second word is used as a generic term for illegitimate sexual activity. Elsewhere in , incest, homosexual intercourse (according to some interpretations) and prostitution are all explicitly forbidden by name (however, the Septuagint uses &quot;porneia&quot; to refer to male temple prostitution). Paul is preaching about activities based on sexual prohibitions in Leviticus, in the context of achieving holiness. The theory suggests it is these, and only these behaviors that are intended by Paul&#x27;s prohibition in chapter seven. The strongest argument against this theory is that the modern interpretation of the New Testament, outside Corinthians, speaks against premarital sex.

Christian orthodoxy accepts that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a virgin at the time Jesus was conceived, based on the accounts in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox, as well as many Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary. However, other Christians reject the dogma, citing sources such as : &quot;Isn&#x27;t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren&#x27;t His sisters here with us?&quot;. The Catholic Church holds that in Semitic usage the terms &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;sister&quot; are applied not only to children of the same parents, but to nephews, nieces, cousins, half-brothers, and half-sisters. Catholics, Orthodox Christians Lutherans, and other groups, such as High Church Anglicans, may refer to Mary as &quot;the Virgin Mary&quot; or &quot;the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says: &quot;There are two elements in virginity: the material element, that is to say, the absence, in the past and in the present, of all complete and voluntary delectation, whether from lust or from the lawful use of marriage; and the formal element, that is the firm resolution to abstain forever from sexual pleasure&quot; and that &quot;Virginity is irreparably lost by sexual pleasure, voluntarily and completely experienced.&quot; However, for the purposes of consecrated virgins it is canonically enough that they have never been married or lived in open violation of chastity.

====Islam====

Islam considers extramarital sex to be sinful and forbidden. Islamic law prescribes punishments for Muslim men and women for the act of zinā. Though in Western cultures premarital sex and loss of virginity may be considered shameful to the individual, in some Muslim societies an act of premarital sex, even if not falling within the legal standards of proof, may result in personal shame and loss of family honor.

In some modern-day largely Muslim societies such as Turkey, vaginal examinations for verifying a woman&#x27;s virginity are a clinical practice which are at times state-enforced. These types of examinations are typically ordered for women who go against traditional societal notions of &quot;public morality and rules of modesty&quot;, though in 1999 the Turkish penal code was altered to require a woman&#x27;s consent prior to performing such an examination.

====Sikhism====
In Sikhism, sexual activity is supposed to occur only between married individuals. Sikhism advises against premarital sex, as it has a high potential of being an indulgence of lust (&quot;kaam&quot;, or extreme sexual desire). Sikhism teaches that young women must have decent modesty (&quot;sharam)&quot; because the honor (&quot;izzat)&quot; of her family could be jeopardized. Sexual activity and even living together prior to marriage is not allowed in Sikhism. Virginity is an important aspect of spirituality and it has to be preserved before marriage, or when one is ready to move into another sacred state of being with their significant other.

<text>A county court is a court based in or with a jurisdiction covering one or more counties, which are administrative divisions (subnational entities) within a country, not to be confused with the medieval system of &quot;county courts&quot; held by the high sheriff of each county.

==England and Wales==
Since 2014, England and Wales have had what is officially described as &quot;a single civil court&quot; named the County Court, with unlimited financial jurisdiction. However it should be understood that there are County Court buildings and courtrooms throughout England and Wales, not one single location. It is &quot;a single civil court&quot; in the sense of a single centrally organised and administered court &quot;system&quot;. Before 2014 there were numerous separate county court systems, each with jurisdiction across England and Wales for enforcement of its orders, but each with a defined &quot;county court district&quot; from which it took claims. County court districts did not have the same boundaries as counties: the name was used because the county courts had evolved from courts which did in fact correspond to a county&#x27;s territory. Today the court sits in many County Court centres, currently corresponding to the old individual county courts.
County Court matters can be lodged at a court in person, by post or via the Internet in some cases through the County Court Bulk Centre. Cases are normally heard at the court having jurisdiction over the area where the claimant lives. Most matters are decided by a district judge or circuit judge sitting alone. Civil matters in England (with minor exceptions, e.g. in some actions against the police) do not have juries. Judges in the County Court are either former barristers or former solicitors, whereas in the High Court they are more likely to have formerly been a barrister.

Civil claims with an amount in controversy under £10,000 (the Jackson Reforms have increased this from £5,000) are dealt with in the County Court under the small claims track (sometimes known to the lay public as &quot;small claims court,&quot; although it is not a separate court). Claims between £10,000 and £25,000 (£15,000 for cases started before April 2009) that are capable of being tried within one day are allocated to the &quot;fast track&quot; and claims over £25,000 (£15,000 for cases started before April 2009) to the &quot;multi track.&quot; These &#x27;tracks&#x27; are labels for the use of the court system - the actual cases will be heard in the County Court or the High Court depending on their value. For personal injury, defamation, and some landlord-tenant dispute cases the thresholds for each track have different values.

Appeals are to a higher judge (a circuit judge hears district judge appeals), the High Court of Justice or to the Court of Appeal, as the case may be.

In debt cases, the aim of a claimant taking County Court action against a defendant is to secure a County Court judgment. This is a legal order to pay the full amount of the debt. Judgments can be enforced at the request of the claimant in a number of ways, including requesting the court bailiffs to seize goods, the proceeds of any sale being used to pay the debt, or an Attachment of Earnings Order, where the defendant&#x27;s employer is ordered to make deductions from the gross wages to pay the claimant.

County Court judgments are recorded in the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines and in the defendant&#x27;s credit records held by credit reference agencies. This information is used in consumer credit scores, making it difficult or more expensive for the defendant to obtain credit. In order to avoid the record being kept for years in the register, the debt must be settled within thirty days after the date the County Court judgment was served (unless the judgment was later set aside). If the debt was not fully paid within the statutory period, the entry will remain for six full years.

== Australia ==

County court is the name given to the intermediate court in one Australian state, namely the County Court of Victoria (in other states and territories it is called the &#x27;District Court&#x27;). They hear indictable (serious) criminal offences except for treason, murder, and manslaughter. Their civil jurisdiction is also intermediate, typically over civil disputes where the amount claimed is greater than a few tens of thousands of dollars but less than a few hundreds of thousands of dollars. The limits vary between states. In some states the same level of court is called a district court. Below them are the magistrates courts. Above them are the state supreme courts. Some states adopt the two-tier appellate system, with the magistrates courts below and the state supreme courts above.
==Northern Ireland==

In Northern Ireland there are seven county courts, following the same model as those of England and Wales before unification in 2014. These are the main civil courts. While higher-value cases are heard in the High Court, the county courts hear a wide range of civil actions, consumer claims, and appeals from magistrates&#x27; courts. The county courts are called family care centres when hearing proceedings brought under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and appeals from the family proceedings courts.

==United States==

Many United States states have a county court system which, least common, may be purely administrative (such as in Missouri), focused primarily on registration of properties and deeds, or, most often, may have jurisdiction over civil cases such as lawsuits and criminal courts and jails (such as in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, et cetera) where trials from misdemeanors to felony cases are centered about a common jail system managed by the county sheriffs departments. For example, in Texas, county courts exclusively handle Class A and B misdemeanors (these carry jail time as well as fines), share jurisdiction with justice of the peace and district courts on some mid-size civil cases, and have appellate jurisdiction from municipal and justice of the peace court cases.

With the growth of the largest cities, many large urban centers have subsumed whole or most of counties within the unofficial or official municipal borders, blurring the distinction between the types of government and their jurisdictions in the mind of the common inhabitant, but even television police drama&#x27;s occasionally point out a county function (coroners, sheriffs, jails, courts, probation departments) different from a metropolis&#x27; police agencies, city governments, and district attorney&#x27;s (prosecutors) offices (politically elected or appointed in most of the United States).

In those states with an administrative county court, the body acts as the executive agency for the local government. For example, Harry S. Truman was county judge of Jackson County, Missouri in the 1930s, an executive position rather than a judicial post. The County Commissioners in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts manage the county government, including funding civil and criminal courts, jails and Sheriffs departments overseeing said jails, as well as recording deeds, maintaining county roads and the like. In point of fact, each state has adjusted local governments powers and interactions to suit their own needs, so no one model is uniform even within the same state when the county is interfacing with a major city.

In counties of Tennessee, the primary legislative body was called a county court until the ratification by the voters of the state of the constitutional amendments of 1978, which change the term for this body in all but consolidated city-counties to county commission. Colloquially, the county commission is still frequently referred to as the &quot;county court&quot;, particularly in rural areas. (The analogous body in consolidated city-counties is the metropolitan county council, usually shortened to &quot;Metro council&quot;.) Likewise, five counties in Oregon are governed by a county court.

In Florida&#x27;s four-tiered court system, the lower two tiers split original jurisdiction for both criminal and civil matters. broadly speaking, the jurisdiction of &quot;county courts&quot; is limited to misdemeanors and civil actions involving amounts in controversy less than $15,000.00, while the &quot;circuit courts&quot; handle felonies and larger civil cases.

===Municipal blendings===
In the states that have a judicial county court, such as New York, it generally handles trials for felonies, as well as appeals of misdemeanors from local courts and some small claims cases. It is a court of original jurisdiction, and thus handles mostly trials of accused felons. The New York County Court &quot;is established in each county outside New York City. It is authorized to handle the prosecution of all crimes committed within the County. The County Court also has limited jurisdiction in civil cases ...&quot; More specifically, the New York County Court is:
In New York City, the New York City Criminal Court handles such jurisdiction.

Otherwise in the United States, the courts of original jurisdiction in most states have jurisdiction over a particular county, parish, shire, or borough (comparable area entities in the various states of the USA); in other cases, instead of being called &quot;county court&quot; they are called &quot;district courts&quot; or &quot;circuit courts&quot; with a hierarchy of state &quot;superior court&quot; districts up to that state&#x27;s &#x27;supreme court&#x27;. Multiple courts of typically limited original jurisdiction within a county are usually called &quot;district courts&quot; or, if located in and serving a particular municipality, &quot;municipal courts&quot;; and are subordinate to the county superior or circuit court. In New York, &#x27;superior&#x27;/&#x27;circuit&#x27; courts are called &quot;supreme court&quot;. The court that in other US jurisdictions is called &quot;supreme court&quot; is called &quot;court of appeal&quot; in New York, Maryland and the District of Columbia.

==Ireland==

Prior to 1924, the county courts were the main civil courts in Ireland, having jurisdiction over most civil matters, except for the larger actions which were heard by the High Court of Justice in Ireland or the assizes. Its jurisdiction was similar to that of the county courts in England and Wales. However, they differed from those court in their procedures. Claims were initiated by way of &quot;civil bill&quot;. Most matters were tried by a county court judge, and where necessary, a jury. The main administrative officer of the county court in each county was the Clerk of the Crown and Peace.

The Courts of Justice Act 1924 abolished the county courts in the Irish Free State and transferred their jurisdiction (together with that of the quarter sessions) to the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court is still based on the organisational structure established for the county courts and the main administrative officer of each circuit is now called the County Registrar.

County courts continue to exist in Northern Ireland. Civil bills are still used as the initiation document for Circuit Court/county court claims in both Irish jurisdictions, unlike in England and Wales.

<doc id="89777" wikidata="Q14284" url="?curid=89777" title="Solicitor">
<text>A solicitor is a legal practitioner who traditionally deals with most of the legal matters in some jurisdictions. A person must have legally defined qualifications, which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in England and Wales a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a practising certificate. There are many more solicitors than barristers in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings.

In the jurisdictions of England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, in the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, Hong Kong, South Africa (where they are called &quot;attorneys&quot;) and the Republic of Ireland, the legal profession is split between solicitors and barristers (called &quot;advocates&quot; in some countries, for example Scotland), and a lawyer will usually only hold one of the two titles. However, in Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the remaining Australian states and territories, the legal profession is now for practical purposes &quot;fused&quot;, allowing lawyers to hold the title of &quot;barrister and solicitor&quot; and practise as both. Some legal graduates will start off as one and then also qualify as the other. In the United States, the barrister–solicitor distinction does not exist at all.

==Australia==

Regulation of the profession in Australia varies from state to state. Admission to practise is state-based, although mutual recognition enables a practitioner admitted in any state or territory to practise in any other state or territory, or at the federal level. In all states and territories, solicitors have unlimited rights of audience and so can, at least in theory, practise as a solicitor, barrister or both. The formal names for admitted solicitors differs between jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions, they are admitted as &quot;legal practitioners&quot;, while in other jurisdictions they are admitted as &quot;solicitors and barristers&quot;.

The extent to which the profession is &quot;fused&quot; in practice varies from state to state. In general, however, there is a separate bar with its own professional body composed of those practitioners who adopt the traditional barrister&#x27;s model of practice, i.e. working in chambers and undertaking advocacy work. In some states, call to the bar requires different or additional training. A proportion of the other practitioners would practise as both solicitors and barristers, while still others would practise primarily or exclusively as solicitors. The relative sizes of the latter two categories differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==England and Wales==

Before the creation of the Supreme Court of Judicature under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, solicitors practised in equity in the Court of Chancery, attorneys practised in the common law courts, and proctors practised in the &quot;civil law&quot; (based on Roman law) of the ecclesiastical courts. The monopoly of the proctors in family, inheritance and admiralty law had been removed in 1857–1859, and the 1873 reforms further fused all three branches of the profession. After 1873 the offices of &quot;attorney&quot; and &quot;proctor&quot; disappeared as terms relating to legally qualified persons, being replaced by &quot;Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Judicature&quot; (subsequently &quot;of the Supreme Court of England and Wales&quot;), except for the unique government offices of Queen&#x27;s (or King&#x27;s) Proctor (now called &quot;HM Procurator-General&quot;, a title generally held by the Treasury Solicitor), and Attorney-General. Since the replacement of the judicial aspect of the House of Lords with a new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (in 2009), separate from the existing Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, the full title of a solicitor is &quot;Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England and Wales&quot;.

The term &quot;attorney&quot; is however still used under English law to refer to someone legally appointed or empowered (who may but need not be legally qualified) to act for another person. Currently, the term is most commonly used to refer to someone so appointed under a &quot;power of attorney&quot;. This may be a &quot;general power of attorney&quot; under section 10 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971; a lasting power of attorney may be granted under the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Some practitioners in specialist professions, notably intellectual property, are also referred to as attorneys, for example registered patent attorneys, which is a separate qualification from that of a solicitor.

===Solicitors and barristers===
In the English legal system, solicitors traditionally dealt with any legal matter, including conducting proceedings in courts, although solicitors were required to engage a barrister as advocate in a High Court or above after the profession split in two. Minor criminal cases are tried in magistrates&#x27; courts, which constitute by far the majority of courts. More serious criminal cases still start in the magistrates&#x27; court and may then be transferred to a higher court.

The majority of civil cases are tried in county courts and are almost always handled by solicitors. Cases of higher value (£100,000 or above) and those of unusual complexity are tried in the High Court, and barristers, as the other branch of the English legal profession, have traditionally carried out the functions of advocacy in the High Court, Crown Court and Court of Appeal.

In the past, barristers did not deal with the public directly. This rigid separation no longer applies. Solicitor advocates with extended rights of audience may now act as advocates at all levels of the courts. Conversely, the public may now hire and interact with a barrister directly in certain types of work without having to go to a solicitor first as a result of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 removing the monopoly of barristers to act as advocates and granting solicitors rights of audience in specified circumstances.

Solicitors now frequently appear in the lower courts and, subject to passing a test and thereby obtaining higher rights of audience, increasingly in the higher courts such as the High Court of Justice of England and Wales and the Court of Appeal. While the independent bar continued to exist in a largely unchanged state, a few firms of solicitors employed their own barristers and solicitor advocates to do some of their court work. The rules preventing barristers from being directly instructed were revised to allow direct instruction by certain organizations such as trade unions, accountants, and similar groups. Additionally, barristers who have completed the Bar Council&#x27;s &quot;Public Access&quot; course can take instructions directly from members of the public under the Public Access Scheme.

Regulation of both barristers and solicitors was reviewed by David Clementi on behalf of the Ministry of Justice in 2004. He delivered his final recommendations in December 2004 which included proposals for a more unified regulatory system and new structures for cross-profession work. Many of his recommendations were enshrined in the Legal Services Act 2007.

The breakdown in the strict separation between barrister and solicitor was expected to go further following recognition by the Act of the so-called &quot;Legal Disciplinary Practice&quot; (LDP) (from 31 March 2009) and &quot;Alternate Business Structure&quot; (ABS) (from 6 October 2011) bodies, which allow more flexibly structured legal practices.

===Regulatory scheme===
Solicitors in England and Wales who wish to practise must pay an annual fee to obtain a practising certificate. This fee is paid to the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents the profession. The Solicitors Regulation Authority, though funded by these fees, acts independently of the Law Society. Together, the two bodies make up the complete system of professional regulation for solicitors. Complaints about solicitors, if not satisfactorily resolved by the solicitors&#x27; firm, may be made to the Legal Ombudsman.

===Training and qualifications===
The training and qualification required to enter the profession by being admitted as a solicitor is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). There are two graduate routes of entry into the profession. Prospective solicitors holding a qualifying law degree proceed to studying the Legal Practice Course. Those holding a non-law degree must in addition have completed a conversion course prior to enrolling on the Legal Practice Course. Once the Legal Practice Course has been completed, the prospective solicitor usually must then undertake two years&#x27; apprenticeship, known as a training contract, with a firm entitled to take trainee solicitors. The Legal Practice Course and training contract can also be undertaken simultaneously although this is less usual. The training contract was formerly known as articles of clerkship. The SRA completed an extensive review of qualification routes into law that has brought about the introduction of the Solicitor Qualifying Examination (SQE). The new route was introduced from 1 September 2021 with the first examinations to take place in November of the same year.

It is possible to qualify as a solicitor without having attended university by being admitted as a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives, and thereafter completing the required number of years of practical experience, and studying for the Legal Practice Course.

Although now on a downward trend, there is a large representation of lawyers in the UK with privately educated backgrounds. 37% of barristers and 21% of solicitors are from a private school background, compared to 7% of the overall UK population.

=== Overseas qualified lawyers ===
Lawyers qualified in foreign jurisdictions, as well as English barristers, can take the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme (QLTS) assessment, a fast-track route for qualification as an English solicitor which can be completed in a shorter or longer period of time, depending on the legal background of the candidate. There is no training or experience requirement under the QLTS, which comprises two assessments; a multiple choice test (180 multiple choice questions on 14 subject matters) and two practical assessments, the OSCE1 and OSCE2 which include nine written papers, three oral papers and three mixed written-oral papers on the most important areas of practice for solicitors (business law, probate, conveyancing, civil litigation, criminal litigation). The scheme is open to qualified lawyers in many common law and civil law jurisdictions, such as the US, Australia, South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Pakistan, all EU member states, as well as other countries.

==Hong Kong==
Hong Kong has maintained the distinction between solicitors, regulated by The Law Society of Hong Kong, and barristers, regulated by the Hong Kong Bar Association. A person intending to become a solicitor must have a professional law degree, either LL.B. or JD or the equivalent, and complete the one-year Postgraduate Certificate in Laws (P.C.LL.) course. They must also complete a two-year trainee solicitor contract with a law firm. All solicitors in Hong Kong are admitted to the High Court of Hong Kong and thus bear the full title of &quot;Solicitor of the High Court of Hong Kong&quot;.

Solicitors enjoy rights of audience in the lower court and in chamber hearings in the High Court. For hearings in open court in the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, only solicitors who have been certified as solicitor advocates may appear.

==Republic of Ireland==

Solicitors in Ireland are represented and regulated by the Law Society of Ireland. It was formally established by Royal Charter in 1852. The legislative basis for its current role is set out in the Solicitors Acts 1954–2002.

In Ireland, it is quite possible to become a solicitor without holding a law degree; a few practising solicitors have no degree of any kind. Instead, individuals sit professional examinations which are set at degree level standard and undertake an intense apprenticeship programme.

The independence of most of Ireland in December 1922 as the Irish Free State was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The Free State later became a Republic in April 1949. The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or &quot;abhcóidí&quot; in Irish) and solicitors (or &quot;aturnaetha&quot; in Irish). There was some blurring of the distinction between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted a right of audience in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates for their clients in the Superior Courts.

==Japan==
In Japan, form the principal branch of the legal profession. &quot;Bengoshi&quot; undertake either or both advocacy work and advice or transaction work typically performed by solicitors in common law jurisdictions.

Another branch of the legal profession, Shihō-shoshi (司法書士), are specialists in registration procedures for real estate and incorporation. With certification by the Ministry of Justice, they are also authorized to represent clients in civil suits filed in courts of summary jurisdiction (with claimed amount up to ¥1.4 million). Although there are some parallels with modern solicitors in common law countries, &quot;shihō-shoshi&quot; is officially translated as &quot;judicial scrivener&quot;, reflecting the similarity of the role with the historical role of scriveners. In 2006, their professional body, Japan Federation of Shihō-shoshi Lawyer&#x27;s Associations (日本司法書士会連合会), proposed that, in English, Shihō-shoshi be called &quot;solicitor&quot; and their organization &quot;Japan Federation of Solicitor Associations&quot;, announcing that they would approach the government and other relevant parties to promote the use of the new translations. The government agencies, however, continue to use the traditional translation &quot;judicial scrivener&quot;. Japan Federation of Shihō-shoshi Lawyer&#x27;s Associations itself translates the profession as &quot;solicitor&quot; on its website.

==United States==
===Historical usage===
Historically, solicitors existed in the United States and, consistent with the pre-1850s usage in England and elsewhere, the term referred to a lawyer who argued cases in a court of equity, as opposed to an attorney who appeared only in courts of law. With the chancery or equity courts disappearing or being subsumed under courts of law, by the late 19th century members of the fused profession were called &quot;attorneys&quot;, with &quot;solicitors&quot; becoming obsolete.

===Modern usage===
In modern American usage, the term solicitor in the legal profession refers to government lawyers.

On the federal level, departmental solicitors remain in the Department of Labor, Department of the Interior, and the Patent &amp; Trademark Office. The Solicitor General of the United States is the lawyer appointed to represent the federal government before the United States Supreme Court.

In various states, the title &quot;solicitor&quot; is still used by town, city and county lawyers. These states include Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and West Virginia.

In South Carolina, criminal trials in the state&#x27;s judicial circuits are overseen by a &quot;circuit solicitor&quot; whose role is analogous to that of district attorney in most other states.

In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the professional organization for government lawyers was formerly known as the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association.

===Common meaning of solicitor===
In the US, &quot;solicitor&quot; is also used to describe a traveling salesman (with a pejorative connotation roughly equivalent to the British English word tout) as in the signed warning on public places of accommodation, &quot;No Soliciting&quot;. Signs bearing the phrase &quot;No Solicitors&quot; may appear near entrances to private residences in the US. In addition to warding off salesmen, these signs are also used to deter proselytizing by religious groups such as Latter-day Saints and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses with a history of door-to-door proselytizing in the US.

<text>Robert Guéï (; 16 March 1941 – 19 September 2002) was an Ivorian politician who was the military ruler from 24 December 1999 to 26 October 2000. He succeeded President Henri Konan Bédié after the 1999 Ivorian coup d&#x27;état and lost to Laurent Gbagbo in the ensuing 2000 Ivorian presidential election. Guéï, his wife Rose Doudou Guéï, and his children were killed on 19 September 2002 on the first day of the First Ivorian Civil War.

==Biography==
Guéï was born in Kabakouma, a village in the western Man Department, and was a member of the Yacouba ethnic community. He was a career soldier: under the French administration, he was trained at the Ouagadougou military school and the St Cyr military school in France. He was an ardent supporter of longtime President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who in 1990, had him chief of the army following a mutiny. After the death of Houphouët-Boigny in 1993, Guéï became distanced from the new leader Henri Konan Bédié. Guéï&#x27;s refusal to mobilize his troops to resolve a political struggle between Bédié and the opposition leader Alassane Ouattara in October 1995 led to his dismissal. He was made a minister but sacked again in August 1996 and forced out of the army in January 1997.

Bédié was overthrown in a coup on Christmas Eve, 1999. Although Guéï had no role in the coup, the popular general was encouraged out of retirement to head the junta until the next elections. On 4 January 2000, he became President of the Republic. Guéï stood in the October 2000 presidential election as an independent. He only allowed one opposition candidate, Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivorian Popular Front, to run against him. Guéï was soundly defeated by Gbagbo but refused to recognize the result. It took a spate of street protests to bring Gbagbo to power. Guéï fled to Gouessesso, near the Liberian border, but remained a figure in the political scene. He was included in a reconciliation forum in 2001 and agreed to refrain from undemocratic methods.

Guéï withdrew from the forum agreement in September 2002, but was killed along with his wife, former First Lady Rose Doudou Guéï, and their children on 19 September 2002, in the Cocody district of Abidjan during the first hours of the civil war. The circumstances of his death remain mysterious, although generally attributed to forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo. Several members of his family and the interior minister, Émile Boga Doudou, were also killed.

Following Guéï&#x27;s death, his body stayed in a morgue until a funeral was held for him in Abidjan on 18 August 2006, nearly four years after his death.

<text>The Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour to [[Taiwan]], informally known as the Love Boat, is currently a three-week summer program for about 70 to 100 College-aged Overseas Chinese and Overseas Taiwanese. In Chinese it is also colloquially referred to as &quot;Měi-Jiā-yíng&quot; (美加營) – “America and Canada Camp” – a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center (劍潭) in Taipei, which is not to be confused with Jiantan subway station.

==Origins of the Study Tour==

The Study Tour program was started in 1967 by the China Youth Corps. According to the Chinese Canadian Archive, the original name of the program was the &quot;Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour&quot; and was initially promoted across North America through various local Chinese newspapers by Chinese North Americans with relations to the Kuomintang party. The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan.

This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government&#x27;s subsidizing of the program was to shore up Overseas Chinese support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the Kuomintang (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the Kuomintang for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the Overseas Chinese community not only for its financing but also for its political support. In fact Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Kuomintang as well as the Republic of China (1912–1949), recognized early the importance of Overseas Chinese support and went as far as to say that &quot;Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.&quot; However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its &quot;Loveboat&quot; reputation of spawning many relationships as well as hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.

==Changes from 1967 to 1999==
The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan&#x27;s changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America, the China Youth Corps conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25. According to journalist Jan Wong, a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at Fu Jen Catholic University. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the Shilin District near modern day Jiantan station. 
It was during this time, the China Youth Corps had changed the name of the Study Tour to &quot;Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,&quot; to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300–500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1,200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in three separate campuses in the 1980s - one at the Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei&#x27;s Tam Kang Campus and a third at Tung-Hai University in TaiChung. During this time, and due to the increase in student numbers, the China Youth Corps came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which has since been renamed the Overseas Community Affairs Council.

This increase in enrollment coincided with both Taiwan&#x27;s 1987 lifting of martial law and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island&#x27;s reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture and improved Chinese language skills, and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the international Chinese community.

This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of &quot;Asian American identity&quot; for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community. There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common &quot;Chinese North American Experience&quot; of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society.

This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships. In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as &quot;little diplomats.&quot; This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters. This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan. These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board (excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan government subsidization, also led to increased popularity for the trip, as most agreed it was an excellent deal.

However, a by-product of the Study Tour&#x27;s increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child. Some parents desiring their children to find a &quot;suitable Chinese spouse&quot; sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour. Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour&#x27;s Love Boat reputation for fear of not being allowed to go. These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other. All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its Love Boat nickname and reputation. Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. 
The job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local college-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students&#x27; itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent (in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on ensuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the China Youth Corps only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as life-changing as did the students who attended.

Another prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory university enrollment, with a preference for students in Ivy League universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, or Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge. Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families. Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe. Participation had gradually increased from Europe, especially countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants. This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among Overseas Chinese worldwide.

By the 1990s, the Study Tour&#x27;s official name was Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China ( 海外莗裔靑年暑期返國硏習團 ). At this time, it had become a 6 week long program with an enrollment of 1200 participants aged from 18–23 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors. As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing language class education schedule.These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others. After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the &quot;Closing Ceremony&quot; in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium. This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous &quot;9 day trip down South&quot; which took all 1,200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas. These scenic attractions included Taroko National Park, Sun Moon Lake, Kenting National Park, and Sanxiantai, among others. The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning, sometimes tearfully, to their countries of origin.

==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==
Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by Ocean Campus in Keelung. Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus. But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei. In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife. Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond. Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour. This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.

==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==
One other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student. According to Valerie Soe&#x27;s 2019 documentary &quot;Loveboat Taiwan&quot;, in August 1993 during that year&#x27;s &quot;9 day trip down south&quot;, a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of Kenting. The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him. His body was not found until it washed up several days later. This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement. Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students. Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour, students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.

==Changes from 2000 to 2012==
The program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the 1999 Jiji earthquake. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted. Further problems for the Study tour continued. The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan&#x27;s Kuomintang party since its inception in 1967. After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour. As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrollment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students. To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the &quot;Baby Boat&quot;, a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12–18. The cuts did not end there. In 2002, due to lack of government support, the China Youth Corps which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.
As a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in Taichung. The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus. This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a &quot;Trip down South.&quot; There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.

In the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even missile threats/military posturing from China. However, no Study Tour year had ever been canceled due to these incidents until the 2003 year. In 2003, the worldwide coronavirus SARS outbreak caused the first ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began. Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions. Similarly, 17 years later, the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic caused the only other documented cancellation of a Study Tour.

The Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of &quot;Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.&quot; One group remained at Chientan Campus which in this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks. Another group was located at Taichung. The enrollment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the Democratic Progressive Party between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in Taiwanese. These changes did not last when the Kuomintang returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in Mandarin were again re-established.

==Changes to Chientan Campus==
The Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the Shilin District for decades since the China Youth Corps first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex. In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center and to replace it with an arts center and park. Complicated negotiations between the China Youth Corps and the Taipei City Government continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise. Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the China Youth Corps to the Taipei City Government. According to the Taipei Public Works Department, &quot;CYC currently pays the rent of Chientan Youth Activity Center on the state-owned property land, which is based on a 5% annual interest rate regulated in &#x27;Rent Criteria of State-owned Property Land Ordinance&#x27; revised on April 1, 2018. Moreover, CYC is recognized as a public welfare group by the Ministry of the Interior. Its land for non-business use should be charged 60% while the rest for business purposes should be calculated at a 160% surcharge.&quot;

==Changes from 2013 to current program==
The documentary &quot;Loveboat Taiwan&quot; further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants. The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer. Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named &quot;Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour&quot;. It is now solely the Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its official website the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 12 and 24 years old. It is also just one of the OCAC&#x27;s many &quot;expatriate&quot; programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year. Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-strait relations. With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes &quot;participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities&quot; as described in the OCAC&#x27;s application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan&#x27;s goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.

Even though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.

==In popular culture==
The documentary &quot;Loveboat Taiwan&quot; by Valerie Soe was released in 2019 to film festivals internationally and to public acclaim, receiving several awards.

On January 7, 2020 Harper Collins published Abigail Hing Wen&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Loveboat, Taipei&quot;, which made the New York Times Top Ten best seller&#x27;s list for Young Adult fiction. She has come out with two sequels to her original novel with &quot;Loveboat Reunion&quot; and &quot;Loveboat Forever.&quot; The film adaption to her first book entitled &quot;Love in Taipei&quot; has been released on the Paramount Plus streaming service since August 10, 2023.

<doc id="89791" wikidata="Q1137751" url="?curid=89791" title="Court of Appeal (England and Wales)">
<text>The Court of Appeal (formally &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Court of Appeal in England&quot;, commonly cited as &quot;CA&quot;, &quot;EWCA&quot; or &quot;CoA&quot;) is the highest court within the Senior Courts of England and Wales, and second in the legal system of England and Wales only to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The Court of Appeal was created in 1875, and today comprises 39 Lord Justices of Appeal and Lady Justices of Appeal.

The court has two divisions, Criminal and Civil, led by the Lady Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls respectively. Criminal appeals are heard in the Criminal Division, and civil appeals in the Civil Division. The Criminal Division hears appeals from the Crown Court, while the Civil Division hears appeals from the County Court, High Court of Justice and Family Court. Permission to appeal is normally required from either the lower court or the Court of Appeal itself; and with permission, further appeal may lie to the Supreme Court. Its decisions are binding on all courts, including itself, apart from the Supreme Court.

==History==
===Formation and early history===
The appeal system before 1875 was chaotic. The superior courts system consisted of 12 different courts, with appeal on common law matters to the Court of Exchequer Chamber, chancery matters to the Court of Appeal in Chancery and other matters to the Privy Council. The Judicature Commission, which was founded in 1867 to investigate the formation of a &quot;Supreme Court&quot; (a High Court and Court of Appeal), conducted a review of this. The result was published in 1869. The recommendation was that there should be a common system of appeal from all of the High Court divisions, with a limited set of appeals allowed to the House of Lords. This reform was implemented by the Judicature Acts, with the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 giving an almost limitless right of appeal to the Lords.

The new legal structure provided a single Court of Appeal, which heard appeals from all the various divisions of the new unified High Court of Justice. It only heard civil cases: opportunities for appealing in criminal cases remained limited until the 20th century. In its early days, the Court of Appeal divided its sittings between Westminster Hall for appeals from the Common Law divisions, and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn for Chancery, Probate, Divorce and Admiralty appeals, with five Lords Justices. After the opening of the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 the Court of Appeal transferred there, where it remains. As well as the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, any previous Lords Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, the Vice-Chancellor of the Chancery Division and the Master of the Rolls could also hear cases, although in practice only the Master of the Rolls did so.

===Changes in appellate jurisdiction and procedure===
The absence of limits on appeals to the House of Lords was the cause of much concern: it led to an additional set of expensive and time-consuming appeals from the Court of Appeal, which thus could not take decisions in the knowledge that they were final. The appeals from the county courts were seen similarly, involving an appeal to the High Court of Justice and the bypassing of the Court of Appeal for a second set of appeals to the Lords. The Administration of Justice (Appeals) Act 1934, a short statute, solved both problems neatly by abolishing the appeal of county court decisions to the High Court and instead sending them automatically to the Court of Appeal, and by establishing that appeals to the Lords could only take place with the consent of the Court of Appeal or of the Lords themselves.

A second set of reforms to the appeals system followed the report of the Evershed Committee on High Court Procedure in 1953, which recognised the high cost to the litigants of an additional set of appeals, particularly since the loser in a civil case paid the victor&#x27;s legal bills. Among the few changes that were made, the practice ceased of counsel reading out the judgment, cross-examinations, documents and evidence given in the lower court; this saved time and costs. The process of &quot;leapfrogging&quot; (appealing from the High Court to the House of Lords without needing to go through the Court of Appeal), which the committee had recommended, was eventually brought into force with the Administration of Justice Act 1969.

A separate Court of Criminal Appeal had been established in 1908. In 1966 this was merged with its older namesake, establishing the present-day structure of a single Court of Appeal with two Divisions: Civil and Criminal.

In the early 1960s there was discussion between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and the United States comparing the processes of appeal used in each nation. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they did like the idea of pre-reading: that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering its judgment. But the idea was quietly scrapped, despite a successful tryout in the Court of Appeal. The court over which Lord Denning presided from 1962 to 1982 was under no pressure and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with the appointment of a Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.

===The Woolf and Bowman reforms===
In July 1996, Lord Woolf published &quot;Access to Justice&quot;, a report on the accessibility of the courts to the public. Woolf identified civil litigation as being characterised by excessive cost, delay and complexity, and succeeded in replacing the diverse rules with a single set of Civil Procedure Rules. Before Woolf had even published his final report, Sir Jeffery Bowman, the recently retired senior partner of PriceWaterhouse, was commissioned to write a report on the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal. Bowman noted a growing workload and delays, with 14 months between setting down and disposing of a case in 70% of cases, the rest taking even longer than that – some had taken five years. He recommended extending the requirement to ask leave to appeal to almost all appeal cases; allowing certain appeals to be heard at a lower level; focusing of procedure; imposition of time limits on oral arguments; and the use of judicial time more towards reading and less towards sitting in court.

Bowman&#x27;s recommendations were mainly enacted through statutory provisions, such as Part IV of the Access to Justice Act 1999. In &quot;Tanfern Ltd v Cameron-MacDonald&quot; [2000] 1 WLR 1311, Brooke LJ laid down the procedural methods of the Court of Appeal post-Woolf and Bowman. With a few exceptions, such as cases where &quot;the liberty of the subject&quot; is an issue, permission is required to appeal, and may be granted either by the lower court or by the Court of Appeal. As a general rule, appeals are now limited to a review of the decision of the lower court, only allowing a full appeal where there was a serious procedural irregularity or the decision was wrong through &quot;blatant error&quot;.

== Divisions ==
===Civil Division===
The Civil Division deals with all non-criminal cases, and has been part of the court since its establishment in 1875. The Civil Division is bound by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom when making decisions, and is normally bound by its own previous decisions, with four exceptions:
* where the previous decision was made without the judges knowing of a particular law: 
* where there are two previous conflicting decisions; 
* where there is a later conflicting Supreme Court or House of Lords decision, and
* where a law was assumed to exist in a previous case but did not. 

The first three were established by the case of &quot;Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd&quot; in 1946, the fourth by &quot;R (on the application of Kadhim) v Brent London Borough Housing Benefit Review Board&quot; in 2001. The Civil Division is led by the Master of the Rolls, currently Geoffrey Vos (who is entitled to the post-nominal MR), assisted by the Vice-President of the Civil Division, Sir Nicholas Underhill. The division hears cases from the High Court of Justice, the County Court and several tribunals.

Although the Lady Chief Justice is senior to the Master of the Rolls, the Civil Division is much broader in scope than the Criminal Division. With only three judges on the bench (rather than five or more in the Supreme Court), this allows the Master of the Rolls huge opportunity for shaping the common law and, most notably, Lord Denning made the most of this potential.

===Criminal Division===
The Criminal Division was established in 1966 with the merger of the Court of Criminal Appeal into the Court of Appeal. It hears all appeals from the Crown Court which are in connection with a trial on indictment (i.e. with a jury) and where the Crown Court has sentenced a defendant committed from the Magistrates&#x27; Court. It also exercises the jurisdiction to order the issue of writs of &quot;venire de novo&quot;. The Criminal Division, while bound by the Supreme Court, is more flexible with binding itself, due to the heightened stakes in a case where a possible penalty is a prison sentence. The Division is led by the Lady Chief Justice, currently The Baroness Carr of Walton-on-the-Hill, assisted by the Vice-President of the Criminal Division, currently Lord Justice Holroyde.

==Procedure for appeal==
Sections 54 to 59 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 and Part 52 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 came into force on 2 May 2000, and created one universal appeals system; not all of these are to the Court of Appeal, with the principle used that an appeal should go to the next highest court in the hierarchy. Appeals are allowed if the decision in the court below was incorrect, or suffered from a serious procedural error or irregularity.

Almost all appeals require permission, a major innovation from the previous system, where appeals were, on the request of counsel, almost all automatically put through. The application for permission should be made to the lower court, although this is not mandatory; it may be asked of the appellate court itself. In &quot;Re T (A Child)&quot; [2002] EWCA Civ 1736, the Civil Division strongly advised that counsel apply at the lower courts, since the judge, fully aware of the facts, will take less time to process, there is no harm if the application fails or if it is approved but counsel decides not to proceed with the case and there are no additional costs involved. The only problem here is that judgments may occasionally be reserved, and only given later by post – there may not be an opportunity to ask for permission to appeal at the lower court.

The Court of Appeal, when considering an application for appeal, may decide based on the paper documents or refer the case to an oral hearing, something often done when it is apparent that a refusal of the written case will lead the applicant to send a second, oral application. If a written application is refused, the applicant may ask for an oral hearing to discuss the refusal. Under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, the appeal must have &quot;a real prospect of success&quot;, or there must be &quot;some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard&quot; for it to be accepted.

Under certain, limited, circumstances, second appeals are allowed. This is when an appeal goes to the High Court or the County Court and a party to the case wishes to appeal it further, to the Court of Appeal. Section 55(1) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 says that, when an appeal is made to the County Court or the High Court and that court makes a decision, no further appeal is allowed to the Court of Appeal unless the Court considers that the case raises &quot;an important point of principle or practice&quot; or &quot;there is some other compelling reason for the Court of Appeal to hear it&quot;. In &quot;Tanfern Ltd v Cameron-MacDonald&quot; [2000] 1 WLR 1311 the Court commented on this limitation of second appeals, pointing out that the Lords Justices of Appeal were a valuable and scarce resource – it was necessary to impose limitations on appeals to prevent the Court and its judges becoming overburdened.

There are two sorts of hearings that the Court of Appeal can hold; reviews, and full rehearings. Section 52.11(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 establishes that appeals should always be reviews, unless there are individual circumstances that, &quot;in the interest of justice&quot;, make a rehearing necessary. In its case law, the Court has emphasised that it is up to the individual panel of judges to decide whether to hold a review or rehearing, with the circumstances of the case playing a large part. In 2004 the Court heard 1,059 appeals, of which 295 were allowed and 413 directly dismissed.

Qualifying cases seeking settlement of contract or personal injury claims up to a value of £100,000, for which permission to appeal has been sought, obtained or adjourned, may be referred to the Court of Appeal Mediation Scheme, a mediation scheme operated by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), so that cases can be resolved more speedily without absorbing court time and impacting less significantly on any ongoing relationship between the litigants. Data reported in 2022 stated that the scheme had achieved a 40–50% success rate.

==Judges==

The Court of Appeal&#x27;s main judges are the Lord Justices of Appeal and Lady Justices of Appeal. The Senior Courts Act 1981 provides that the Court of Appeal comprises 39 ordinary sitting Lords and Lady Justices and the Lady Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, President of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, President of the Family Division, and Chancellor of the High Court. Retired Lords and Lady Justices sometimes sit in cases, as have retired Law Lords, and High Court judges are allowed to sit on occasion and there are a number of Senior Circuit Judges authorised to sit as judges of the Criminal Division.

Lords and Lady Justices have, since 1946, been drawn exclusively from the High Court of Justice; prior to this, Lords Justices were sometimes recruited directly from the Bar. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was the first woman appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1988; she was known officially as &quot;Lord Justice&quot; until a practice direction was issued in 1994 to refer to her informally as &quot;Lady Justice&quot;, and the official title in section 3 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 was amended by the Courts Act 2003. Dame Kathryn Thirlwall was the twelfth Lady Justice, appointed in 2017, bringing the number of active Lady Justices to 9 out of 39.

The division of work in the Court of Appeal is demonstrated by the 2005 statistics, in which Lords and Lady Justices sat 66% of the time, High Court Judges 26% of the time and Circuit and Deputy High Court Judges 8 per cent of the time. Lord and Lady Justices are currently paid £188,900, with the Master of the Rolls paid £205,700 and the Lady Chief Justice £230,400.

The Civil Division is led by the Master of the Rolls, currently Sir Geoffrey Vos; the Chancellor of the High Court and President of the Family Division regularly, for a period of weeks, lead the Civil Division. Several Civil Division Lords Justices are seconded to the Criminal Division, which is currently led by the Lady Chief Justice, The Baroness Carr of Walton-on-the-Hill.

==Broadcasting==
On 31 October 2013 the Court of Appeal allowed cameras in the court for a (70-second broadcast delay) &quot;live&quot; broadcast feed for the first time. Cameras were banned in all courts in 1925 (although they were allowed in the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom from its 2009 inception). Cameras have now been allowed in some courts due to changes made by the Crime and Courts Act 2013. In 2013, only one court could be broadcast per day.

<doc id="89792" wikidata="Q221674" url="?curid=89792" title="Mitochondrial Eve">
<text>In human genetics, the Mitochondrial Eve (more technically known as the Mitochondrial-Most Recent Common Ancestor, shortened to mt-Eve or mt-MRCA) is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all living humans. In other words, she is defined as the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.

In terms of mitochondrial haplogroups, the mt-MRCA is situated at the divergence of macro-haplogroup L into L0 and L1–6. As of 2013, estimates on the age of this split ranged at around 155,000 years ago, consistent with a date later than the speciation of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; but earlier than the recent out-of-Africa dispersal.

The male analog to the &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; is the &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot; (or Y-MRCA), the individual from whom all living humans are patrilineally descended. As the identity of both matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs is dependent on genealogical history (pedigree collapse), they need not have lived at the same time. As of 2015, estimates of the age of the Y-MRCA range around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, roughly consistent with the emergence of anatomically modern humans.

The name &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; alludes to the biblical Eve, which has led to repeated misrepresentations or misconceptions in journalistic accounts on the topic. Popular science presentations of the topic usually point out such possible misconceptions by emphasizing the fact that the position of mt-MRCA is neither fixed in time (as the position of mt-MRCA moves forward in time as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages become extinct), nor does it refer to a &quot;first woman&quot;, nor the only living female of her time, nor the first member of a &quot;new species&quot;.

==History==
===Early research===
Early research using molecular clock methods was done during the late 1970s to early 1980s. Allan Wilson, Mark Stoneking, Rebecca L. Cann and Wesley Brown found that mutation in human mtDNA was unexpectedly fast, at 0.02 substitution per base (1%) in a million years, which is 5–10 times faster than in nuclear DNA. Related work allowed for an analysis of the evolutionary relationships among gorillas, chimpanzees (common chimpanzee and bonobo) and humans. With data from 21 human individuals, Brown published the first estimate on the age of the mt-MRCA at 180,000 years ago in 1980. A statistical analysis published in 1982 was taken as evidence for recent African origin (a hypothesis which at the time was competing with Asian origin of &quot;H. sapiens&quot;).

===1987 publication===
By 1985, data from the mtDNA of 145 women of different populations, and of two cell lines, HeLa and GM 3043, derived from an African American and a ǃKung respectively, were available. After more than 40 revisions of the draft, the manuscript was submitted to &quot;Nature&quot; in late 1985 or early 1986 and published on 1 January 1987. The published conclusion was that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa, at the time dated to between 140,000 and 200,000 years ago.

The dating for &quot;Eve&quot; was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, which was debated at the time, and a boost to the theory of the recent origin model.

Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; or even the name &quot;Eve&quot; in their original paper. It is however used by Cann in an article entitled &quot;In Search of Eve&quot; in the September–October 1987 issue of &quot;The Sciences&quot;. It also appears in the October 1987 article in &quot;Science&quot; by Roger Lewin, headlined &quot;The Unmasking of Mitochondrial Eve&quot;. The biblical connotation was very clear from the start. The accompanying research news in &quot;Nature&quot; had the title &quot;Out of the garden of Eden&quot;.

Wilson himself preferred the term &quot;Lucky Mother&quot; and thought the use of the name Eve &quot;regrettable&quot;. But the concept of Eve caught on with the public and was repeated in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; cover story (11 January 1988 issue featured a depiction of Adam and Eve on the cover, with the title &quot;The Search for Adam and Eve&quot;), and a cover story in &quot;Time&quot; on 26 January 1987.

===Criticism and later research===
Shortly after the 1987 publication, criticism of its methodology and secondary conclusions was published. Both the dating of mt-Eve and the relevance of the age of the purely matrilineal descent for population replacement were subjects of controversy during the 1990s; Alan Templeton (1997) asserted that the study did &quot;not support the hypothesis of a recent African origin for all of humanity following a split between Africans and non-Africans 100,000 years ago&quot; and also did &quot;not support the hypothesis of a recent global replacement of humans coming out of Africa.&quot;

The placement by of a relatively small population of humans in sub-Saharan Africa was consistent with the hypothesis of Cann (1982) and lent considerable support for the &quot;recent out-of-Africa&quot; scenario.

In 1999, Krings et al. eliminated problems in molecular clocking postulated by Nei (1992) when it was found that the mtDNA sequence for the same region was substantially different from the MRCA relative to any human sequence.

In 1997, published a study of mtDNA mutation rates in a single, well-documented family (the Romanov family of Russian royalty). In this study, they calculated a mutation rate upwards of twenty times higher than previous results.

Although the original research did have analytical limitations, the estimate on the age of the mt-MRCA has proven robust. More recent age estimates have remained consistent with the 140–200 kya estimate published in 1987: A 2013 estimate dated Mitochondrial Eve to about 160 kya (within the reserved estimate of the original research) and Out of Africa II to about 95 kya. Another 2013 study (based on genome sequencing of 69 people from 9 different populations) reported the age of Mitochondrial Eve between 99 and 148 kya and that of the Y-MRCA between 120 and 156 kya.

==Female and mitochondrial ancestry==


Without a DNA sample, it is not possible to reconstruct the complete genetic makeup (genome) of any individual who died very long ago. By analysing descendants&#x27; DNA, however, parts of ancestral genomes are estimated by scientists. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, the DNA located in mitochondria, different from the DNA in the nucleus of a cell) and Y-chromosome DNA are commonly used to trace ancestry in this manner. mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally. Matrilineal descent goes back through mothers, to their mothers, until all female lineages converge.

Branches are identified by one or more unique markers which give a mitochondrial &quot;DNA signature&quot; or &quot;haplotype&quot; (e.g. the CRS is a haplotype). Each marker is a DNA base-pair that has resulted from an SNP mutation. Scientists sort mitochondrial DNA results into more or less related groups, with more or less recent common ancestors. This leads to the construction of a DNA family tree where the branches are in biological terms clades, and the common ancestors such as Mitochondrial Eve sit at branching points in this tree. Major branches are said to define a haplogroup (e.g. CRS belongs to haplogroup H), and large branches containing several haplogroups are called &quot;macro-haplogroups&quot;.

The mitochondrial clade which Mitochondrial Eve defines is the species &quot;&quot; itself, or at least the current population or &quot;chronospecies&quot; as it exists today. In principle, earlier Eves can also be defined going beyond the species, for example one who is ancestral to both modern humanity and Neanderthals, or, further back, an &quot;Eve&quot; ancestral to all members of genus &quot;&quot; and chimpanzees in genus &quot;&quot;. According to current nomenclature, Mitochondrial Eve&#x27;s haplogroup was within mitochondrial haplogroup L because this macro-haplogroup contains all surviving human mitochondrial lineages today, and she must predate the emergence of L0.

The variation of mitochondrial DNA between different people can be used to estimate the time back to a common ancestor, such as Mitochondrial Eve. This works because, along any particular line of descent, mitochondrial DNA accumulates mutations at the rate of approximately one every 3,500 years per nucleotide. A certain number of these new variants will survive into modern times and be identifiable as distinct lineages. At the same time some branches, including even very old ones, come to an end when the last family in a distinct branch has no daughters.

Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor for all modern humans. Whenever one of the two most ancient branch lines dies out (by producing only non-matrilinear descendants at that time), the MRCA will move to a more recent female ancestor, always the most recent mother to have more than one daughter with living maternal line descendants alive today. The number of mutations that can be found distinguishing modern people is determined by two criteria: first and most obviously, the time back to her, but second and less obviously by the varying rates at which new branches have come into existence and old branches have become extinct. By looking at the number of mutations which have been accumulated in different branches of this family tree, and looking at which geographical regions have the widest range of least related branches, the region where Eve lived can be proposed.

==Popular reception and misconceptions==
&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported on Mitochondrial Eve based on the Cann &quot;et al.&quot; study in January 1988, under a heading of &quot;Scientists Explore a Controversial Theory About Man&#x27;s Origins&quot;. The edition sold a record number of copies.

The popular name &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot;, of 1980s coinage, has contributed to a number of popular misconceptions. At first, the announcement of a &quot;mitochondrial Eve&quot; was even greeted with endorsement from young earth creationists, who viewed the theory as a validation of the biblical creation story.

Due to such misunderstandings, authors of popular science publications since the 1990s have been emphatic in pointing out that the name is merely a popular convention, and that the mt-MRCA was not in any way the &quot;first woman&quot;. Her position is purely the result of genealogical history of human populations later, and as matrilineal lineages die out, the position of mt-MRCA keeps moving forward to younger individuals over time.

In &quot;River Out of Eden&quot; (1995), Richard Dawkins discussed human ancestry in the context of a &quot;river of genes&quot;, including an explanation of the concept of Mitochondrial Eve. &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot; (2002) presented the topic of human mitochondrial genetics to a general audience. &quot;The Real Eve: Modern Man&#x27;s Journey Out of Africa&quot; by Stephen Oppenheimer (2003) was adapted into a 2002 Discovery Channel documentary.

===Not the only woman===
One common misconception surrounding Mitochondrial Eve is that since all women alive today descended in a direct unbroken female line from her, she must have been the only woman alive at the time. However, nuclear DNA studies indicate that the effective population size of ancient humans never dropped below tens of thousands. Other women living during Eve&#x27;s time may have descendants alive today but not in a direct female line.

===Not a fixed individual over time===

The definition of Mitochondrial Eve is fixed, but the woman in prehistory who fits this definition can change. That is, not only can our knowledge of when and where Mitochondrial Eve lived change due to new discoveries, but the actual Mitochondrial Eve can change. The Mitochondrial Eve can change, when a mother-daughter line comes to an end. It follows from the definition of Mitochondrial Eve that she had at least two daughters who both have unbroken &quot;female&quot; lineages that have survived to the present day. In every generation mitochondrial lineages end – when a woman with unique mtDNA dies with no daughters. When the mitochondrial lineages of daughters of Mitochondrial Eve die out, then the title of &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; shifts forward from the remaining daughter through her matrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had two or more daughters who together have all living humans as their matrilineal descendants. Once a lineage has died out it is irretrievably lost and this mechanism can thus only shift the title of &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; forward in time.

Because mtDNA mapping of humans is very incomplete, the discovery of living mtDNA lines which predate our current concept of &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; could result in the title moving to an earlier woman. This happened to her male counterpart, &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot;, when an older Y line, haplogroup A-00, was discovered.

===Not necessarily a contemporary of &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot;===
Sometimes Mitochondrial Eve is assumed to have lived at the same time as Y-chromosomal Adam (from whom all living males are descended patrilineally), and perhaps even met and mated with him. Even if this were true, which is currently regarded as highly unlikely, this would only be a coincidence. Like Mitochondrial &quot;Eve&quot;, Y-chromosomal &quot;Adam&quot; probably lived in Africa. A recent study (March 2013) concluded however that &quot;Eve&quot; lived much later than &quot;Adam&quot; – some 140,000 years later. (Earlier studies considered, conversely, that &quot;Eve&quot; lived earlier than &quot;Adam&quot;.) More recent studies indicate that it is not impossible that Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam might have lived around the same time.

===Not the most recent ancestor shared by all humans===

Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common &quot;matrilineal&quot; ancestor, not the &quot;most recent common ancestor&quot;. Since the mtDNA is inherited maternally and recombination is either rare or absent, it is relatively easy to track the ancestry of the lineages back to a MRCA; however, this MRCA is valid only when discussing mitochondrial DNA. An approximate sequence from newest to oldest can list various important points in the ancestry of modern human populations:

* The human MRCA. The time period that human MRCA lived is unknown. Rohde et al put forth a &quot;rough guess&quot; that the MRCA could have existed 5000 years ago; however, the authors state that this estimate is &quot;extremely tentative, and the model contains several obvious sources of error, as it was motivated more by considerations of theoretical insight and tractability than by realism.&quot; Just a few thousand years before the most recent single ancestor shared by all living humans was the time at which all humans who were then alive either left no descendants alive today or were common ancestors of all humans alive today. However, such a late date is difficult to reconcile with the geographical spread of our species and the consequent isolation of different groups from each other. For example, it is generally accepted that the indigenous population of Tasmania was isolated from all other humans between the rise in sea level after the last ice age some 8000 years ago and the arrival of Europeans. Estimates of the MRCA of even closely related human populations have been much more than 5000 years ago.
* The identical ancestors point. In other words, &quot;each present-day human has exactly the same set of genealogical ancestors&quot; alive at the &quot;identical ancestors point&quot; in time. This is far more recent than when Mitochondrial Eve was proposed to have lived.
* Mitochondrial Eve, the most recent female-line common ancestor of all living people.
* &quot;Y-chromosomal Adam&quot;, the most recent male-line common ancestor of all living people.

<doc id="89793" wikidata="Q208266" url="?curid=89793" title="Out of Africa (film)">
<text>Out of Africa is a 1985 American epic romantic drama film directed and produced by Sydney Pollack, and starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. The film is based loosely on the 1937 autobiographical book &quot;Out of Africa&quot; written by Isak Dinesen (the pseudonym of Danish author Karen Blixen), with additional material from Dinesen&#x27;s 1960 book &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot; and other sources.

The book was adapted into a screenplay by Kurt Luedtke, and this screenplay was filmed in 1984. Streep played Karen Blixen, Redford played Denys Finch Hatton, and Klaus Maria Brandauer played Baron Bror Blixen. Others in the film include Michael Kitchen as Berkeley Cole, Malick Bowens as Farah, Stephen Kinyanjui as the Chief, Michael Gough as Lord Delamere, Suzanna Hamilton as Felicity, and the model and actress Iman as Mariammo. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. It was also a commercial success and won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Pollack.

==Plot==
In 1913, after being spurned by a Swedish nobleman, Karen Blixen proposes a marriage of convenience to his brother, Baron Bror Blixen. They prepare to move to Nairobi, British East Africa, where Bror is to set up a dairy ranch with Karen&#x27;s money. She will join him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, Karen&#x27;s train is hailed by big-game hunter Denys Finch Hatton, who knows Bror and entrusts her with his ivory haul.

Farah, the Somali headman Bror hired, greets Karen at the railway station. She is taken to the Muthaiga Club. She enters the men-only salon seeking her husband but is asked to leave. Karen and Bror immediately marry, and she becomes Baroness Blixen.

Karen learns that Bror has changed their plan and instead bought a coffee farm, but it is at too high an elevation to be very productive. Karen needs Bror&#x27;s help managing the farm, but he is more interested in guiding big-game hunting safaris.

Karen comes to love Africa and its people. She looks after the Kikuyu people who are squatting on her land, establishes a school for them, helps with their medical needs, and arbitrates their disputes. Meanwhile, she attempts to build a formal European homelife equal to other nearby upper-class colonists. She befriends a young woman, Felicity (whose character is based on a young Beryl Markham). Eventually, Karen and Bror&#x27;s mutual feelings deepen, and they consummate their marriage. However, Bror continues pursuing other women. To fill her evenings, Karen makes up imaginative stories to entertain visitors.

As World War I reaches East Africa, the colonists form a militia led by colonial patriarch Lord Delamere, and which includes Denys and Bror. A military expedition searches for forces from the neighboring German colony of German East Africa. Responding to the militia&#x27;s need for supplies, Karen leads a difficult expedition to find them and returns safely.

When Karen contracts syphilis from Bror, she returns to Denmark for treatment and recuperation while Bror manages the farm in her absence. When Karen returns, Bror resumes his safari work. They live separately after she discovers he is still a philanderer. Later, Karen and Denys share an ambivalent kiss at a New Year&#x27;s party.

The relationship between Karen and Denys develops, and he comes to live with her. Denys acquires a Gipsy Moth biplane and often takes Karen flying. Karen and Bror divorce when Bror wants to marry another woman. Karen wants Denys to solidify their relationship, though he prefers his autonomy. When Karen learns Denys is taking Felicity on a private safari, she confronts him about his refusing to be monogamous. He assures Karen he only wants her but feels marriage is immaterial. This eventually drives them apart, and refusing to meet Karen&#x27;s ultimatum not to take Felicity flying, he moves out.

The farm eventually yields a good harvest, but a fire destroys it and the factory, forcing Karen to sell out. Before leaving Kenya for Denmark, she appeals to the incoming governor to provide land for her Kikuyu workers and sells most of her remaining possessions at a rummage sale. Denys visits the now-empty house. He says he no longer feels comfortable being alone and that his feelings for her have changed. He asks to join her on her journey back to Mombasa.

Denys departs for a safari scouting trip in his airplane but will fly Karen to Mombasa when he returns; Karen will then continue to Denmark. Shortly after, Bror arrives to tell Karen that Denys&#x27; biplane crashed in Tsavo. During Denys&#x27; funeral, Karen recites an excerpt from an A. E. Housman poem about a lauded athlete who, like Denys, died young and was not fated to decline into old age.

Before departing, Karen goes to the Muthaiga Club to arrange the forwarding of her mail. The members, having come to admire her, invite her into the men-only salon for a toast. At the railway station, she gives Farah the compass that Denys had given to her and asks him to say her name so that she can hear his voice one last time. Sometime later, Farah writes to Karen in Denmark, telling her that a pair of lions often visit Denys&#x27;s grave.

A textual epilogue reveals that Karen became an author, publishing her works under the name Isak Dinesen, and never returned to Africa.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film tells the story as a series of six loosely coupled episodes from Karen&#x27;s life, intercut with her narration. The final two narrations, the first a reflection on Karen&#x27;s experiences in Kenya and the second a description of Finch Hatton&#x27;s grave, were taken from her book &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, while the others were written for the film in imitation of her very lyrical writing style. The pace of this film is often rather slow, reflecting Blixen&#x27;s book, &quot;Natives dislike speed, as we dislike noise...&quot;

Klaus Maria Brandauer was director Sydney Pollack&#x27;s only choice for Bror Blixen, even having trouble to pick a replacement when it appeared that Brandauer&#x27;s schedule would prevent him from participating. Robert Redford became Finch Hatton, with Pollack thinking Redford had a charm no British actor could convey. Meryl Streep landed the part by showing up for her meeting with the director wearing a low-cut blouse and a push-up bra, as Pollack had originally thought the actress did not have enough sex appeal for the role. Before it went to Meryl Streep, the role of Karen Blixen was offered to Audrey Hepburn.

&quot;Out of Africa&quot; was filmed using descendants of several people of the Kikuyu tribe who are named in the book, including the grandson of chief Kinyanjui who played his grandfather. Much of it was filmed in the Karen / Lang&#x27;ata area near the actual Ngong Hills outside Nairobi. The Chyulu Hills stood in for the less picturesque Ngong Hills. As Karen&#x27;s farmhouse was at the time of filming a part of a local nursing school, the filming took place in her nearby first house &quot;Mbogani&quot;, which is a dairy today. Her actual house, known as &quot;Mbagathi&quot; is now the Karen Blixen Museum. A substantial part of the filming took place in the Scott house and in a recreation of 1910s Nairobi built in an area of unoccupied land in Langata.

The scenes depicting the Government House were shot at Nairobi School with the administration block providing a close replica of British colonial governors&#x27; residences. The train sequences were filmed along a section of abandoned track between Gilgil and Thompsons Falls some north west of Nairobi. The steam locomotive, taken from display in the Nairobi Railway Museum was non functional, therefore a diesel locomotive was hidden inside a box car behind the steam locomotive and the diesel pushed the train along while steam and smoke effects were provided. The scenes set in Denmark were actually filmed in Surrey, England.

==Historical differences==

Although bearing the name of Dinesen&#x27;s book, the picture was actually taken from two other books (not written by her) as well. It quotes the start of the Dinesen&#x27;s book, &quot;I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills&quot;, and Karen recites, &quot;He prayeth well, who loveth well both man and bird and beast&quot; from &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, which becomes the epitaph inscribed on Finch Hatton&#x27;s grave marker.

The film omits much of Dinesen&#x27;s book, such as a devastating locust swarm, some local shootings, and her writings about the German army. The production also plays down the size of her farm, which had 800 Kikuyu workers and an 18-oxen wagon. Scenes show Karen as owning only one dog, but actually, she had two similar dogs named Dawn and Dusk.

The movie also takes liberties with Denys and Karen&#x27;s romance. They met at a hunting club, not in the plains. Denys was away from Kenya for two years on military assignment in Egypt, which is not mentioned. Denys took up flying and began to lead safaris after he moved in with Karen. The film also ignores that Karen was pregnant at least once with Finch Hatton&#x27;s child but suffered from miscarriages. Furthermore, Denys was an English aristocrat and son of 13th Earl of Winchilsea, but this fact was minimized by the hiring of the actor Robert Redford, an inarguably all-American actor who had previously worked with Pollack. When Redford accepted the contract to play, he did so fully intending to play him as an Englishman. Pollack, however, felt an English accent would be distracting for the audience, and told Redford to use his real accent. In fact, Redford reportedly had to re-record some of his lines from early takes in the filming, in which he still spoke with a trace of English accent.

The title scenes of the film show the main railway, from Mombasa to Nairobi, as traveling through the Kenyan Rift Valley, on the steep back side of the actual Ngong Hills. However, the real railway track is located on the higher, opposite side of the Ngong Hills. The passenger car was actually a small combination office/sleeper that was originally used by supervisors during the building of the Uganda Railway and was the actual car from which a man was taken and killed by a marauding lioness.

==Soundtrack==

The music for &quot;Out of Africa&quot; was composed and conducted by veteran English composer John Barry. The score included a number of outside pieces such as the second movement Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Clarinet Concerto&quot; and African traditional songs. The soundtrack garnered Barry an Oscar for Best Original Score and sits in fifteenth place in the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of top 25 American film scores. The soundtrack was first released through MCA Records in 1985 and features 12 tracks of score at a running time of just over thirty-three minutes. In 1987, a Special Edition was issued that included the song &quot;The Music of Goodbye (Love Theme)&quot; by Melissa Manchester &amp; Al Jarreau. A rerecording conducted by Joel McNeely and performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra was released in 1997 through Varèse Sarabande and features eighteen tracks of score at a running time just under thirty-nine minutes.
In 2024 Intrada Records issued a 2-CD expansion containing the full score, alternates, source music and the 1985 soundtrack album.

==Technical notes==
In the Director&#x27;s Notes on the DVD of Pollack&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, Pollack himself stated that he filmed &quot;Out of Africa&quot; and his later films of that decade in 1.85:1 widescreen; and that it &quot;...probably was one I should have had in widescreen&quot; (i.e. anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen). In his director&#x27;s notes, Pollack stated that prior to the filming of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, he made motion pictures exclusively in the anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen format and style, and that he did not resume the anamorphic 2.39:1 widescreen format, due to the rise of pan and scan which had affected the compositions of many anamorphic movies, until his last movie, &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, in 2005.

==Release==
===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 62% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though lensed with stunning cinematography and featuring a pair of winning performances from Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, &quot;Out of Africa&quot; suffers from excessive length and glacial pacing.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 69 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and called it &quot;one of the great recent epic romances,&quot; adding, &quot;What we have here is an old-fashioned, intelligent, thoughtful love story, told with enough care and attention that we really get involved in the passions among the characters.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a big, physically elaborate but wispy movie&quot; with Redford&#x27;s character &quot;a total cipher, and a charmless one at that. It&#x27;s not Mr. Redford&#x27;s fault. There&#x27;s no role for him to act.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and declared: &quot;My basic problem with this otherwise sumptuous and well-acted film is that I never was able to accept Redford in character ... He seems distant to the point of distraction. He is not convincing in his period outfits. He looks and acts as if he just walked out of the safari fitting room at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;well worth the wait,&quot; calling it &quot;a sprawling but always intelligent romantic epic that depicts Karen Blixen&#x27;s struggles to hold on to both the man and the land she loves and cannot possess.&quot;

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;seems to be just the thing for famished culture mavens at Christmastime. Unfortunately, and through no fault of Meryl Streep, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough electricity generated out there in Africa to power a love story 2½ hours long&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; found that the film &quot;rarely really comes to life except when Redford is around, which unfortunately is not often in the first hour,&quot; but once Streep and Redford get together it becomes &quot;a wonderful romance, probably Redford&#x27;s best since &quot;The Way We Were&quot;&quot;.

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the film as &quot;unsatisfying&quot; and wrote that Streep is &quot;animated in the early scenes; she&#x27;s amusing when she acts ditsy, and she has some oddly affecting moments. Her character doesn&#x27;t deepen though, or come to mean more to us, and Redford doesn&#x27;t give out with anything for her to play against.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the film &quot;has little in the way of narrative drive&quot; and &quot;rarely seems more than an elevated form of tourism.&quot;

Reviewing the film in 2009, James Berardinelli wrote: &quot;Watching &quot;Out of Africa&quot; a quarter of a century after its release, it&#x27;s almost impossible to guess how it won the Oscar for Best Picture ... Sydney Pollack&#x27;s direction is quietly competent and the acting by Meryl Streep and Robert Redford is top notch. But the lazy story is little more than an ordinary melodrama that simmers without ever reaching a boil. To tell the truth, during the entirety of the movie&#x27;s nearly three-hour running length, I was more interested in the scenery and Barry&#x27;s music than I was in the characters.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was the fifth-highest grossing film of 1985 in the United States and Canada with a gross of $87 million. It grossed $227.5 million worldwide and was the second highest-grossing film in Germany with a gross of $23 million.

<doc id="89796" wikidata="Q27075" url="?curid=89796" title="Mitochondrial DNA">
<text>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA and mDNA) is the DNA located in the mitochondria organelles in a eukaryotic cell that converts chemical energy from food into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial DNA is a small portion of the DNA contained in a eukaryotic cell; most of the DNA is in the cell nucleus, and, in plants and algae, the DNA also is found in plastids, such as chloroplasts.

Human mitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced. This sequencing revealed that human mtDNA has 16,569 base pairs and encodes 13 proteins. As in other vertebrates, the human mitochondrial genetic code differs slightly from nuclear DNA.

Since animal mtDNA evolves faster than nuclear genetic markers, it represents a mainstay of phylogenetics and evolutionary biology. It also permits tracing the relationships of populations, and so has become important in anthropology and biogeography.

== Origin ==
Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to have separate evolutionary origins, with the mtDNA derived from the circular genomes of bacteria engulfed by the ancestors of modern eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the endosymbiotic theory. In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in mammals) are coded by nuclear DNA, but the genes for some, if not most, of them are thought to be of bacterial origin, having been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during evolution.

The reasons mitochondria have retained some genes are debated. The existence in some species of mitochondrion-derived organelles lacking a genome suggests that complete gene loss is possible, and transferring mitochondrial genes to the nucleus has several advantages. The difficulty of targeting remotely-produced hydrophobic protein products to the mitochondrion is one hypothesis for why some genes are retained in mtDNA; colocalisation for redox regulation is another, citing the desirability of localised control over mitochondrial machinery. Recent analysis of a wide range of mtDNA genomes suggests that both these features may dictate mitochondrial gene retention.

== Genome structure and diversity ==
Across all organisms, there are six main mitochondrial genome types, classified by structure (i.e. circular versus linear), size, presence of introns or plasmid like structures, and whether the genetic material is a singular molecule or collection of homogeneous or heterogeneous molecules.

In many unicellular organisms (e.g., the ciliate &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; and the green alga &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot;), and in rare cases also in multicellular organisms (e.g. in some species of Cnidaria), the mtDNA is linear DNA. Most of these linear mtDNAs possess telomerase-independent telomeres (i.e., the ends of the linear DNA) with different modes of replication, which have made them interesting objects of research because many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtDNA are known pathogens.

=== Animals ===
Most (bilaterian) animals have a circular mitochondrial genome. Medusozoa and calcarea clades however include species with linear mitochondrial chromosomes. With a few exceptions, animals have 37 genes in their mitochondrial DNA: 13 for proteins, 22 for tRNAs, and 2 for rRNAs.

Mitochondrial genomes for animals average about 16,000 base pairs in length. The anemone &quot;Isarachnanthus nocturnus&quot; has the largest mitochondrial genome of any animal at 80,923 bp. The smallest known mitochondrial genome in animals belongs to the comb jelly &quot;Vallicula multiformis&quot;, which consist of 9,961 bp.

In February 2020, a jellyfish-related parasite – &quot;Henneguya salminicola&quot; – was discovered that lacks a mitochondrial genome but retains structures deemed mitochondrion-related organelles. Moreover, nuclear DNA genes involved in aerobic respiration and mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription were either absent or present only as pseudogenes. This is the first multicellular organism known to have this absence of aerobic respiration and live completely free of oxygen dependency.

=== Plants and fungi ===
There are three different mitochondrial genome types in plants and fungi. The first type is a circular genome that has introns (type 2) and may range from 19 to 1000 kbp in length. The second genome type is a circular genome (about 20–1000 kbp) that also has a plasmid-like structure (1 kb) (type 3). The final genome type found in plants and fungi is a linear genome made up of homogeneous DNA molecules (type 5).

Great variation in mtDNA gene content and size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a core subset of genes present in all eukaryotes (except for the few that have no mitochondria at all). In Fungi, however, there is no single gene shared among all mitogenomes.
Some plant species have enormous mitochondrial genomes, with &quot;Silene conica&quot; mtDNA containing as many as 11,300,000 base pairs. Surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.
The genome of the mitochondrion of the cucumber (&quot;Cucumis sativus&quot;) consists of three circular chromosomes (lengths 1556, 84 and 45 kilobases), which are entirely or largely autonomous with regard to their replication.

=== Protists ===
Protists contain the most diverse mitochondrial genomes, with five different types found in this kingdom. Type 2, type 3, and type 5 of the plant and fungal genomes also exist in some protists, as do two unique genome types. One of these unique types is a heterogeneous collection of circular DNA molecules (type 4) while the other is a heterogeneous collection of linear molecules (type 6). Genome types 4 and 6 each range from 1–200 kbp in size.

The smallest mitochondrial genome sequenced to date is the 5,967 bp mtDNA of the parasite &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;.

Endosymbiotic gene transfer, the process by which genes that were coded in the mitochondrial genome are transferred to the cell&#x27;s main genome, likely explains why more complex organisms such as humans have smaller mitochondrial genomes than simpler organisms such as protists.

== Replication ==
Mitochondrial DNA is replicated by the DNA polymerase gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the &quot;POLG&quot; gene and two 55 kDa accessory subunits encoded by the &quot;POLG2&quot; gene. The replisome machinery is formed by DNA polymerase, TWINKLE and mitochondrial SSB proteins. TWINKLE is a helicase, which unwinds short stretches of dsDNA in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. All these polypeptides are encoded in the nuclear genome.

During embryogenesis, replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo. The resulting reduction in per-cell copy number of mtDNA plays a role in the mitochondrial bottleneck, exploiting cell-to-cell variability to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging mutations. According to Justin St. John and colleagues, &quot;At the blastocyst stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the trophectoderm. In contrast, the cells of the inner cell mass restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the signals to differentiate to specific cell types.&quot;


==Genes on the human mtDNA and their transcription==
The two strands of the human mitochondrial DNA are distinguished as the heavy strand and the light strand. The heavy strand is rich in guanine and encodes 12 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, two ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S), and 14 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The light strand encodes one subunit and 8 tRNAs. So, altogether mtDNA encodes for two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 protein subunits, all of which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process.

Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the human mitochondrial genome map). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are released from the primary transcript. Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.

===Regulation of transcription===

The promoters for the initiation of the transcription of the heavy and light strands are located in the main non-coding region of the mtDNA called the displacement loop, the D-loop. There is evidence that the transcription of the mitochondrial rRNAs is regulated by the heavy-strand promoter 1 (HSP1), and the transcription of the polycistronic transcripts coding for the protein subunits are regulated by HSP2.

Measurement of the levels of the mtDNA-encoded RNAs in bovine tissues has shown that there are major differences in the expression of the mitochondrial RNAs relative to total tissue RNA. Among the 12 tissues examined the highest level of expression was observed in the heart, followed by brain and steroidogenic tissue samples.

As demonstrated by the effect of the trophic hormone ACTH on adrenal cortex cells, the expression of the mitochondrial genes may be strongly regulated by external factors, apparently to enhance the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins necessary for energy production. Interestingly, while the expression of protein-encoding genes was stimulated by ACTH, the levels of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA showed no significant change.

== Mitochondrial inheritance ==
In most multicellular organisms, mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains on average 200,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a healthy human sperm has been reported to contain on average 5 molecules), degradation of sperm mtDNA in the male genital tract and the fertilized egg; and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent (uniparental inheritance) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants, and also in fungi.

In a study published in 2018, human babies were reported to inherit mtDNA from both their fathers and their mothers resulting in mtDNA heteroplasmy, a finding that has been rejected by other scientists.

=== Female inheritance ===
In sexual reproduction, mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother; the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, mitochondria are present solely in the midpiece, which is used for propelling the sperm cells, and sometimes the midpiece, along with the tail, is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. Some &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an oocyte, may interfere with this.

The fact that mitochondrial DNA is mostly maternally inherited enables genealogical researchers to trace maternal lineage far back in time. (Y-chromosomal DNA, paternally inherited, is used in an analogous way to determine the patrilineal history.) This is usually accomplished on human mitochondrial DNA by sequencing the hypervariable control regions (HVR1 or HVR2), and sometimes the complete molecule of the mitochondrial DNA, as a genealogical DNA test. HVR1, for example, consists of about 440 base pairs. These 440 base pairs are compared to the same regions of other individuals (either specific people or subjects in a database) to determine maternal lineage. Most often, the comparison is made with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence. Vilà &quot;et al.&quot; have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs from wolves.
The concept of the Mitochondrial Eve is based on the same type of analysis, attempting to discover the origin of humanity by tracking the lineage back in time.

=== The mitochondrial bottleneck ===
Entities subject to uniparental inheritance and with little to no recombination may be expected to be subject to Muller&#x27;s ratchet, the accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits random processes in the cell to increase the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo in which different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of the random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and the random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.

=== Male inheritance ===
Male mitochondrial DNA inheritance has been discovered in Plymouth Rock chickens. Evidence supports rare instances of male mitochondrial inheritance in some mammals as well. Specifically, documented occurrences exist for mice, where the male-inherited mitochondria were subsequently rejected. It has also been found in sheep, and in cloned cattle. Rare cases of male mitochondrial inheritance have been documented in humans. Although many of these cases involve cloned embryos or subsequent rejection of the paternal mitochondria, others document &quot;in vivo&quot; inheritance and persistence under lab conditions.

Doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA is observed in bivalve mollusks. In those species, females have only one type of mtDNA (F), whereas males have F-type mtDNA in their somatic cells, but M-type mtDNA (which can be as much as 30% divergent) in germline cells. Paternally inherited mitochondria have additionally been reported in some insects such as fruit flies, honeybees, and periodical cicadas.

=== Mitochondrial donation ===

An IVF technique known as mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA from the mother and father. In the spindle transfer procedure, the nucleus of an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed but still contains the donor female&#x27;s mtDNA. The composite egg is then fertilized with the male&#x27;s sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with genetically defective mitochondria wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy mitochondria. The first known child to be born as a result of mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a Jordanian couple in Mexico on 6 April 2016.

== Mutations and disease ==

=== Susceptibility ===
The concept that mtDNA is particularly susceptible to reactive oxygen species generated by the respiratory chain due to its proximity remains controversial. mtDNA does not accumulate any more oxidative base damage than nuclear DNA. It has been reported that at least some types of oxidative DNA damage are repaired more efficiently in mitochondria than they are in the nucleus. mtDNA is packaged with proteins which appear to be as protective as proteins of the nuclear chromatin. Moreover, mitochondria evolved a unique mechanism which maintains mtDNA integrity through degradation of excessively damaged genomes followed by replication of intact/repaired mtDNA. This mechanism is not present in the nucleus and is enabled by multiple copies of mtDNA present in mitochondria. The outcome of mutation in mtDNA may be an alteration in the coding instructions for some proteins, which may have an effect on organism metabolism and/or fitness.

=== Genetic illness ===

Mutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including exercise intolerance and Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS), which causes a person to lose full function of heart, eye, and muscle movements. Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and age-associated pathologies. Particularly in the context of disease, the proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules in a cell is termed heteroplasmy. The within-cell and between-cell distributions of heteroplasmy dictate the onset and severity of disease and are influenced by complicated stochastic processes within the cell and during development.

Mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs can be responsible for severe diseases like the MELAS and MERRF syndromes.

Mutations in nuclear genes that encode proteins that mitochondria use can also contribute to mitochondrial diseases. These diseases do not follow mitochondrial inheritance patterns but instead follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.

=== Use in disease diagnosis ===

Recently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative prostate biopsy.
mtDNA alterations can be detected in the bio-fluids of patients with cancer. mtDNA is characterized by the high rate of polymorphisms and mutations. Some of these are increasingly recognized as an important cause of human pathology such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorders, maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Neurodegenerative disease, heart failure, and cancer.

===Relationship with ageing===
Though the idea is controversial, some evidence suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents about the size of mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a &#x27;Vicious Cycle&#x27;); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at an accelerated rate to age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the &#x27;Vicious Cycle&#x27; hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. The application of a mitochondrial-specific ROS scavenger, which lead to a significant longevity of the mice studied, suggests that mitochondria may still be well-implicated in ageing. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat ageing. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.
In a recent study, it was shown that dietary restriction can reverse ageing alterations by affecting the accumulation of mtDNA damage in several organs of rats. For example, dietary restriction prevented age-related accumulation of mtDNA damage in the cortex and decreased it in the lung and testis.

=== Neurodegenerative diseases ===

Increased mtDNA damage is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases.

The brains of individuals with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage in both nuclear DNA and mtDNA, but the mtDNA has approximately 10-fold higher levels than nuclear DNA. It has been proposed that aged mitochondria is the critical factor in the origin of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Analysis of the brains of AD patients suggested an impaired function of the DNA repair pathway, which would cause reduce the overall quality of mtDNA.

In Huntington&#x27;s disease, mutant huntingtin protein causes mitochondrial dysfunction involving inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, higher levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidative stress. Mutant huntingtin protein promotes oxidative damage to mtDNA, as well as nuclear DNA, that may contribute to Huntington&#x27;s disease pathology.

The DNA oxidation product 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage. In persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the enzymes that normally repair 8-oxoG DNA damages in the mtDNA of spinal motor neurons are impaired. Thus oxidative damage to mtDNA of motor neurons may be a significant factor in the etiology of ALS.

=== Correlation of the mtDNA base composition with animal life spans ===

Over the past decade, an Israeli research group led by Professor Vadim Fraifeld has shown that strong and significant correlations exist between the mtDNA base composition and animal species-specific maximum life spans. As demonstrated in their work, higher mtDNA guanine + cytosine content (GC%) strongly associates with longer maximum life spans across animal species. An additional observation is that the mtDNA GC% correlation with the maximum life spans is independent of the well-known correlation between animal species&#x27; metabolic rate and maximum life spans. The mtDNA GC% and resting metabolic rate explain the differences in animal species&#x27; maximum life spans in a multiplicative manner (i.e., species maximum life span = their mtDNA GC% * metabolic rate). To support the scientific community in carrying out comparative analyses between mtDNA features and longevity across animals, a dedicated database was built named MitoAge.

=== mtDNA mutational spectrum is sensitive to species-specific life-history traits ===
De novo mutations arise either due to mistakes during DNA replication or due to unrepaired damage caused in turn by endogenous and exogenous mutagens. It has been long believed that mtDNA can be particularly sensitive to damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, G&gt;T substitutions, the hallmark of the oxidative damage in the nuclear genome, are very rare in mtDNA and do not increase with age. Comparing the mtDNA mutational spectra of hundreds of mammalian species, it has been recently demonstrated that species with extended lifespans have an increased rate of A&gt;G substitutions on single-stranded heavy chains. This discovery led to the hypothesis that A&gt;G is a mitochondria-specific marker of age-associated oxidative damage. This finding provides a mutational (contrary to the selective one) explanation for the observation that long-lived species have GC-rich mtDNA: long-lived species become GC-rich simply because of their biased process of mutagenesis. An association between mtDNA mutational spectrum and species-specific life-history traits in mammals opens a possibility to link these factors together discovering new life-history-specific mutagens in different groups of organisms.

=== Relationship with non-B (non-canonical) DNA structures ===
Deletion breakpoints frequently occur within or near regions showing non-canonical (non-B) conformations, namely hairpins, cruciforms, and cloverleaf-like elements. Moreover, data supports the involvement of helix-distorting intrinsically curved regions and long G-tetrads in eliciting instability events. In addition, higher breakpoint densities were consistently observed within GC-skewed regions and in the close vicinity of the degenerate sequence motif YMMYMNNMMHM.

== Use in forensics ==

Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of recombination, there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the mutation rate of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA, mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females (matrilineage) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.

mtDNA testing can be used by forensic scientists in cases where nuclear DNA is severely degraded. Autosomal cells only have two copies of nuclear DNA but can have hundreds of copies of mtDNA due to the multiple mitochondria present in each cell. This means highly degraded evidence that would not be beneficial for STR analysis could be used in mtDNA analysis. mtDNA may be present in bones, teeth, or hair, which could be the only remains left in the case of severe degradation. In contrast to STR analysis, mtDNA sequencing uses Sanger sequencing. The known sequence and questioned sequence are both compared to the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence to generate their respective haplotypes. If the known sample sequence and questioned sequence originated from the same matriline, one would expect to see identical sequences and identical differences from the rCRS. Cases arise where there are no known samples to collect and the unknown sequence can be searched in a database such as EMPOP. The Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods recommends three conclusions for describing the differences between a known mtDNA sequence and a questioned mtDNA sequence: exclusion for two or more differences between the sequences, inconclusive if there is one nucleotide difference, or inability to exclude if there are no nucleotide differences between the two sequences.

The rapid mutation rate (in animals) makes mtDNA useful for assessing the genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny (evolutionary relationships; see phylogenetics) among different species. To do this, biologists determine and then compare the mtDNA sequences from different individuals or species. Data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences, which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtDNAs were taken. mtDNA can be used to estimate the relationship between both closely related and distantly related species. Due to the high mutation rate of mtDNA in animals, the 3rd positions of the codons change relatively rapidly and thus provide information about the genetic distances among closely related individuals or species. On the other hand, the substitution rate of mt-proteins is very low, thus amino acid changes accumulate slowly (with corresponding slow changes at 1st and 2nd codon positions) and thus they provide information about the genetic distances of distantly related species. Statistical models that treat substitution rates among codon positions separately, can thus be used to simultaneously estimate phylogenies that contain both closely and distantly related species

Mitochondrial DNA was admitted into evidence for the first time ever in a United States courtroom in 1996 during &quot;State of Tennessee v. Paul Ware&quot;.

In the 1998 United States court case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Patricia Lynne Rorrer, mitochondrial DNA was admitted into evidence in the State of Pennsylvania for the first time. The case was featured in episode 55 of season 5 of the true crime drama series Forensic Files (season 5).

Mitochondrial DNA was first admitted into evidence in California, United States, in the successful prosecution of David Westerfield for the 2002 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam in San Diego: it was used for both human and dog identification. This was the first trial in the U.S. to admit canine DNA.

The remains of King Richard III, who died in 1485, were identified by comparing his mtDNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of his sister who were alive in 2013, 527 years after he died.

== Use in evolutionary biology and systematic biology ==
mtDNA is conserved across eukaryotic organisms given the critical role of mitochondria in cellular respiration. However, due to less efficient DNA repair (compared to nuclear DNA), it has a relatively high mutation rate (but slow compared to other DNA regions such as microsatellites) which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary relationships—phylogeny—of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an evolutionary tree for the species examined.

For instance, while most nuclear genes are nearly identical between humans and chimpanzees, their mitochondrial genomes are 9.8% different. Human and gorilla mitochondrial genomes are 11.8% different, suggesting that humans may be more closely related to chimpanzees than gorillas.

== mtDNA in nuclear DNA ==
Whole genome sequences of more than 66,000 people revealed that most of them had some mitochondrial DNA inserted into their nuclear genomes. More than 90% of these nuclear-mitochondrial segments (NUMTs) were inserted after humans diverged from the other apes. Results indicate such transfers currently occur as frequently as once in every ≈4,000 human births.

It appears that organellar DNA is much more often transferred to nuclear DNA than previously thought. This observation also supports the idea of the endosymbiont theory that eukaryotes have evolved from endosymbionts which turned into organelles while transferring most of their DNA to the nucleus so that the organellar genome shrunk in the process.

== History ==

Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by electron microscopy as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria, and by Ellen Haslbrunner, Hans Tuppy and Gottfried Schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.

== Mitochondrial sequence databases ==
Several specialized databases have been founded to collect mitochondrial genome sequences and other information. Although most of them focus on sequence data, some of them include phylogenetic or functional information.
* AmtDB: a database of ancient human mitochondrial genomes.
* InterMitoBase: an annotated database and analysis platform of protein-protein interactions for human mitochondria. (apparently last updated in 2010, but still available)
* MitoBreak: the mitochondrial DNA breakpoints database.
* MitoFish and MitoAnnotator: a mitochondrial genome database of fish. See also Cawthorn et al.
* Mitome: a database for comparative mitochondrial genomics in metazoan animals (no longer available)
* MitoRes: a resource of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and their products in metazoa (apparently no longer being updated)
* MitoSatPlant: Mitochondrial microsatellites database of viridiplantae.
* MitoZoa 2.0: a database for comparative and evolutionary analyses of mitochondrial genomes in Metazoa. (no longer available)

== MtDNA-phenotype association databases ==
Genome-wide association studies can reveal associations of mtDNA genes and their mutations with phenotypes including lifespan and disease risks. In 2021, the largest, UK Biobank-based, genome-wide association study of mitochondrial DNA unveiled 260 new associations with phenotypes including lifespan and disease risks for e.g. type 2 diabetes.

=== Mitochondrial mutation databases ===
Several specialized databases exist that report polymorphisms and mutations in the human mitochondrial DNA, together with the assessment of their pathogenicity.
* MitImpact: A collection of pre-computed pathogenicity predictions for all nucleotide changes that cause non-synonymous substitutions in human mitochondrial protein-coding genes MitImpact 3D - IRCCS-CSS Bioinformatics lab.
* MITOMAP: A compendium of polymorphisms and mutations in human mitochondrial DNA WebHome &lt; MITOMAP &lt; Foswiki.

<text>Berwick-upon-Tweed (), sometimes known as Berwick-on-Tweed or simply Berwick, is a town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, south of the Anglo-Scottish border, and the northernmost town in England. The 2011 United Kingdom census recorded Berwick&#x27;s population as 12,043.

The town is at the mouth of the River Tweed on the east coast, south east of Edinburgh, north of Newcastle upon Tyne, and north of London. Uniquely for England, the town is slightly further north than Denmark&#x27;s capital Copenhagen and the southern tip of Sweden, further east of the North Sea, which Berwick borders.

Berwick was founded as an Anglo-Saxon settlement in the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was annexed by England in the 10th century. A civil parish and town council were formed in 2008 comprising the communities of Berwick, Spittal and Tweedmouth. It is the northernmost civil parish in England.

For more than 400 years, the area was central to historic border wars between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and several times possession of Berwick changed hands between the two kingdoms. The last time it changed hands was when Richard of Gloucester retook it for England in 1482. To this day, many Berwickers feel a close affinity to Scotland. Both Berwick Rangers Football Club and Berwick Rugby Football Club play in Scottish leagues.

Berwick remains a traditional market town and also has some notable architectural features, in particular its medieval town walls, its Georgian Town Hall, its Elizabethan ramparts, and Britain&#x27;s earliest barracks buildings, which Nicholas Hawksmoor built (1717–1721) for the Board of Ordnance.

== Name ==

Berwick&#x27;s name is of the same origin as the word &quot;&quot;, denoting a portion of farmland which was detached from a manor and reserved for a lord&#x27;s own use. This comes from the Old English &quot;berewíc&quot;, meaning &quot;corn farm&quot; (more specifically, &quot;bere&quot; refers to barley). Its earliest recorded spelling, as &quot;Berewich&quot;, dates from 1167. There are several places in Britain with the same name; one such is North Berwick in Scotland, and Berwick-upon-Tweed has also been called &quot;South Berwick&quot; in Scottish sources. The medieval seal of the town showed a bear and a wych tree as a pun on the name.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

In the post-Roman period, the area was inhabited by the Brythons of Bryneich. Later, the region became part of the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. Bernicia later united with the kingdom of Deira to form Northumbria, which in the mid-10th century entered the Kingdom of England under Eadred.

Berwick remained part of the Earldom of Northumbria until control passed to the Scots following the Battle of Carham of 1018. The town itself was founded as an Anglo-Saxon settlement during the time of the Kingdom of Northumbria.

=== Scottish burgh ===

Between the late 10th and early 11th centuries, the land between the rivers Forth and Tweed came under Scottish control, either through conquest by Scotland or through cession by England. Berwick was made a royal burgh by David I (reigned 1124–1153). David also established many of the shires of Scotland, with Berwick becoming the county town of Berwickshire, which covered the town and a largely rural area to the north-west of it. A mint was present in the town by 1153. In 1276, William de Baddeby was Constable of Berwick.

While under Scottish control, Berwick was referred to as &quot;South Berwick&quot; to differentiate it from the town of North Berwick, East Lothian, near Edinburgh.

Berwick had a medieval hospital for the sick and poor, which the Church administered. A charter under the Great Seal of Scotland, confirmed by King James I of Scotland, grants the king&#x27;s chaplain &quot;Thomas Lauder of the House of God or Hospital lying in the burgh of Berwick-upon-Tweed, to be held to him for the whole time of his life with all lands, teinds, rents and profits, etc., belonging to the said hospital, as freely as is granted to any other hospital in the Kingdom of Scotland; the king also commands all those concerned to pay to the grantee all things necessary for the support of the hospital. Dated at Edinburgh June 8, in the 20th year of his reign.&quot;

=== Disputed territory ===

Berwick&#x27;s strategic position on the Anglo-Scottish border during centuries of war between the two nations and its relatively great wealth led to a succession of raids, sieges and takeovers. William I of Scotland invaded and attempted to capture northern England in 1173–74. After his defeat in 1174, Berwick was ceded to Henry II of England under the Treaty of Falaise, along with four other castles at Edinburgh, Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and Stirling, with the five castles to be garrisoned with English troops paid for at Scottish expense. The Treaty of Falaise was annulled in 1189 when William paid Richard I of England 10,000 marks sterling to contribute towards the latter&#x27;s crusade.

Berwick had become a prosperous town by the middle of the 13th century. According to William Edington, a bishop and chancellor of England, Berwick was &quot;so populous and of such commercial importance that it might rightly be called another Alexandria, whose riches were the sea and the water its walls&quot;.

In 1291–92, Berwick was the site of Edward I of England&#x27;s arbitration in the contest for the Scottish crown between John Balliol and Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale. The decision in favour of Balliol was pronounced in the Great Hall of Berwick Castle on 17 November 1292.

In 1296, England went to war with France, with which Scotland was in alliance. Balliol invaded England in response, sacking Cumberland. Edward, in turn, invaded Scotland and captured Berwick, destroying much of the town and massacring the burgesses, merchants and artisans of the town.

Edward I went again to Berwick in August 1296 to receive formal homage from some 2,000 Scottish nobles, after defeating the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar in April and forcing John Balliol to abdicate at Kincardine Castle the following July. At this time, work began on building the town walls (and rebuilding the earlier Castle); these fortifications were complete by 1318 and subsequently improved under Scottish rule. An arm of William Wallace was displayed at Berwick after his execution and quartering on 23 August 1305.

In 1314, Edward II of England mustered 25,000 men at Berwick, who later fought in the crushing defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn. Between 1315 and 1318, Scottish armies, sometimes with the help of Flemish and German privateers, besieged and blockaded the town, finally capturing it in April 1318.

England retook Berwick the day after the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333. The Scots briefly took control of the town of Berwick (but not its castle) after a siege in November 1355, but were in turn besieged by the English, who retook the town in January 1356. In October 1357, a treaty was signed at Berwick by which the Scottish estates undertook to pay 100,000 marks as a ransom for David II of Scotland, who had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross on 17 October 1346. In 1461, Berwick was ceded back to Scotland by Margaret of Anjou on behalf of her husband, Henry VI, in return for help against the Yorkists during the Wars of the Roses.

Robert Lauder of Edrington was put in charge of the castle. He was succeeded in 1474 by David, Earl of Crawford. On 3 February 1478, Robert Lauder of the Bass and Edrington was again appointed Keeper of the castle, a position that he held until the final year of Scottish control, when Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes, had possession.

In 1482, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) recaptured the town. Thomas Gower () was the English marshal of Berwick 1543-1552. The Scots did not accept this conquest evidenced by innumerable charters for at least two centuries after this date, but never regained control of the town. over a little more than 400 years, Berwick had changed hands more than a dozen times.

=== English town ===
Much of southern Scotland was again invaded by England during the &quot;Rough Wooing&quot; (also known as the Eight Years&#x27; War) of 1543–1551. The war ended with the Treaty of Norham in 1551, which saw England withdraw back to the border as had existed before the war began, and so retaining Berwick. Under the treaty, Berwick was declared to be a free town, independent of either kingdom. In practice it was controlled by England and sent members of parliament to the English parliament, but as an independent borough, outside the authority of the sheriffs of any English county, similar to a county corporate.

During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England, vast sums – one source reports &quot;£128,648, the most expensive undertaking of the Elizabethan period&quot; – were spent on its fortifications, in a new Italian style (&quot;trace italienne&quot;), designed both to withstand artillery and to facilitate its use from within the fortifications. These fortifications have been described as &quot;the only surviving walls of their kind&quot;. Sir Richard Lee designed some of the Elizabethan works, and the Italian military engineer Giovanni Portinari was also involved in the project.

Berwick&#x27;s role as a border fortress town ended with England and Scotland&#x27;s Union of the Crowns. On 6 April 1603, James VI of Scotland crossed the Border on his journey southwards to be crowned James I of England. He was met at Lamberton by the Lord Governor of Berwick with a mounted party from the garrison and was conducted into the town. In December 1603, the Crown ordered the dissolution of the garrison of Berwick and the number of soldiers was reduced to 100 men and pensioners.

In 1639, the army of Charles I faced that of General Alexander Leslie at Berwick in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, which were concerned with bringing the Presbyterian Church of Scotland under Charles&#x27;s control. The two sides did not fight, but negotiated the Pacification of Berwick.

Berwick Bridge, also known as the &quot;Old Bridge&quot; dates to 1611. It linked Islandshire on the south bank of the River Tweed with the county burgh of Berwick on the north bank. Holy Trinity Church was built in 1648–52. It is the most northerly parish church in England and was built under special licence from Oliver Cromwell during the Commonwealth period.

=== British town ===

In 1707, the Act of Union united England and Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. Since then, Berwick has remained within the laws and legal system of England and Wales. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 (since repealed) deemed that whenever legislation referred to England, it applied to Berwick without the need for a specific reference to the town.

Until the 1830s the borough boundaries of the town were identical to the parish of Berwick, which lay entirely on the north side of the River Tweed, covering the main part of the built-up area and the rural areas immediately north-west of it. By that time, Tweedmouth on the south side of the river had grown to a sizeable population, effectively as a suburb of the town but outside the borough boundaries. Under the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 the parliamentary borough (constituency) of Berwick was enlarged to include the townships of Tweedmouth and Spittal south of the Tweed. A couple of years later, the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 standardised how boroughs were governed across England and Wales, and Berwick&#x27;s municipal boundaries were enlarged to match the parliamentary borough, bringing Tweedmouth and Spittal under the jurisdiction of Berwick&#x27;s town council. The same act also formalised Berwick&#x27;s status as an independent county corporate. The population of the borough in 1841 was 12,578, and that of the parish was 8,484.

In the 1840s, Samuel Lewis included similar entries for Berwick-upon-Tweed in both his England and Scotland &quot;Topographical Dictionary&quot;. Berwick remained a county in its own right, and remained a separate parliamentary constituency until 1885 when it was merged to become a division of Northumberland under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In 1889 elected county councils were established under the Local Government Act 1888, which were based on the parliamentary boundaries of counties, and so Berwick was brought under the jurisdiction of Northumberland County Council, with the town council thereafter being a lower-tier authority subordinate to the county council.
England now is officially defined as &quot;subject to any alteration of boundaries under Part IV of the Local Government Act 1972, the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of that Act, Greater London and the Isles of Scilly&quot;, which thus includes Berwick. In the 1972 act&#x27;s reorganisation of English local government from 1 April 1974, the Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was created by the merger of the previous borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed with Belford Rural District, Glendale Rural District and Norham and Islandshires Rural District.

The Interpretation Act 1978 provides that in legislation passed between 1967 and 1974, &quot;a reference to England includes Berwick upon Tweed and Monmouthshire&quot;.

In 2009 the Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was abolished as part of wider structural changes to local government in England. All functions previously exercised by Berwick Borough Council were transferred to Northumberland County Council, which is the unitary authority for the area.

== Governance ==

During periods of Scottish administration, Berwick was the county town of Berwickshire, to which the town gave its name. Thus at various points in the Middle Ages and from 1482 (when Berwick became administered by England), Berwickshire had the unique distinction of being the only county in the British Isles to be named after a town in another country.

In 1958, the borough&#x27;s council applied for a coat of arms, but applied to the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the Scottish heraldic authority, for the grant &quot;as suitable to a Burgh of Scotland&quot;, which was duly granted.

On 1 April 1974, the borough was merged with Belford Rural District, Glendale Rural District and Norham and Islandshires Rural District to form Berwick Borough Council.

Northumberland County Council became the unitary authority for the area when the Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was abolished on 1 April 2009.

A new Berwick-upon-Tweed Town Council was created on 1 April 2008 covering Berwick-upon-Tweed, Tweedmouth, and Spittal. It has taken over the former Borough&#x27;s mayoralty and regalia. The mayor for 2022–2023 is Mike Greener.

Berwick-upon-Tweed is in the parliamentary constituency of North Northumberland.

== Economy ==
Slightly more than 60% of the population is employed in the service sector, including shops, hotels and catering, financial services and most government activity, including health care. Some current and recent Berwick economic activities include salmon fishing, shipbuilding, engineering, sawmilling, fertilizer production, malting and the manufacture of tweed and hosiery.

Berwick town centre comprises the Mary Gate and High Street where many local shops and some retail chains exist. New office development has been built in the Walker Gate beside the library, which combined space with the Northumberland Adult Learning Centre and Tourism centre.

There is a retail park in Tweedmouth consisting of a Homebase, Farm Foods, Marks and Spencer, Argos, Next, and Lidl. Berwick Borough Council refused a proposal from Asda in 2006 to build a store near the site, but in 2008 gave Tesco planning permission for its new store in the town, which opened on 13 September 2010. Asda went on to take over the Co-op shop unit in Tweedmouth in early 2010.

A Morrisons supermarket with a petrol station, alongside a branch of McDonald&#x27;s, a Travelodge UK and an Aldi all exist on Loaning Meadows close to the outskirts of the town near the current A1. The Aldi outlet moved its operations to a new location in the newly constructed Loaning Meadows Retail Park which also hosts KFC and Costa Coffee drive-throughs, A Food Warehouse wholesale store, Greggs and a Home Bargains supermarket. The retail park is located adjacent to the Morrisons store.

== Transport ==
The old A1 road passes through Berwick. The modern A1 goes around the town to the west. The town is on the East Coast Main Line railway and is served by Berwick-upon-Tweed railway station. A small seaport at Tweedmouth facilitates the import and export of goods but provides no passenger services. The port is protected by a long breakwater built in the 19th century, at the end of which is a red and white lighthouse. Completed in 1826, the tower emits a white light every five seconds from a window overlooking the sea. Seafarers&#x27; charity Apostleship of the Sea has a chaplain to support the needs of mariners arriving at the port.

Bus services are mostly operated by Borders Buses (part of West Coast Motors) and Arriva providing both local and longer links. The town is also served by National Express coaches.

== Culture ==

=== Berwick&#x27;s identity ===

Berwick is famous for its hesitation over whether it is part of Scotland or England. Some people are adamant they are English and their loyalty lies with Northumberland, while others feel an affinity with Scotland. Whilst it has been argued that the town&#x27;s geographic and historic place between the two has led to it developing a distinctive identity of its own, many people in Berwick also have mixed Anglo-Scottish families which contributes to a sense of separate identity. Historian Derek Sharman said &quot;The people of Berwick feel really independent. You are a Berwicker first, Scottish or English second.&quot; Former mayor Mike Elliot said &quot;25% of the town consider themselves English, 25% Scottish and 50% Berwickers.&quot; Professor Dominic Watt of the University of Aberdeen noted that: &quot;Older people view themselves more as Scots than the younger people in Berwick, and this can be heard in their accents.&quot;

In 2008, SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) Christine Grahame made calls in the Scottish Parliament for Berwick to become part of Scotland again. The Liberal Democrat MSP Jeremy Purvis, who was born and brought up in Berwick, asked for the border to be moved twenty miles south, stating: &quot;There&#x27;s a strong feeling that Berwick should be in Scotland. Until recently, I had a gran in Berwick and another in Kelso, and they could see that there were better public services in Scotland.&quot; However, Alan Beith, the former MP for Berwick, said the move would require a massive legal upheaval and is not realistic. Beith&#x27;s successor as MP, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: &quot;Voters in Berwick-upon-Tweed do not believe it is whether they are in England or Scotland that is important.&quot;

=== Berwick dialect ===

The local speech of Berwick-upon-Tweed shares many characteristics with both other rural Northumberland dialects and East Central Scots. In 1892, linguist Richard Oliver Heslop divided the county of Northumberland into four dialect zones and placed the Berwick dialect in the &quot;north-Northumbrian&quot; region, an area extending from Berwick down to the River Coquet. Likewise, Charles Jones (1997) classes the dialect as &quot;predominantly North-Northumbrian&quot; with &quot;a few features shared with Scots&quot;.

Features of this dialect include the &quot;Northumbrian burr&quot;, a distinct pronunciation of the letter R historically common to many dialects of North East England; and predominant non-rhoticity: older speakers tend to be slightly rhotic, while younger speakers are universally non-rhotic.

A sociological study of the Anglo-Scottish border region conducted in 2000 found that locals of Alnwick, south of Berwick, associated the Berwick accent with Scottish influence. Conversely, those from Eyemouth, Scotland, north of Berwick, firmly classed Berwick speech as English, identifying it as &quot;Northumbrian or Geordie&quot;.

=== Sport ===

Berwick Rangers Football Club were formed in the town in 1881. The club plays in the Scottish football league system. The home stadium of Berwick Rangers is Shielfield Park, and the club currently plays in the Lowland League, the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system. The town also has a rugby union side, Berwick RFC, who play in Scottish Rugby Union&#x27;s East Regional League Division 1. Before 2016, the two teams were unique in being English teams that play in Scottish leagues.

A newer team in the town Tweedmouth Rangers Football Club has played in the East of Scotland Football League since 2016. Before this, they were members of the North Northumberland League. Their home ground is Old Shielfield Park, which the club uses under an agreement with Berwick Rangers Football Club.

Speedway has taken place in Berwick in two separate eras. The sport was introduced to Shielfield Park in May 1968. A dispute between the speedway club and the stadium owners ended the first spell. The sport returned to Shielfield Park in the mid-1990s. The lack of a venue in the town saw the team move to a rural location called Berrington Lough. The team, known as the Bandits, have raced at all levels from First Division to Conference League (first to third levels).

=== Media === 
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Chatton TV transmitter, and with its close proximity to the Scottish Borders, BBC Scotland and ITV Border can also be received from the Selkirk TV transmitter.

The town&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle on 96.0 FM and Greatest Hits Radio on 102.3 FM.

Berwick-upon-Tweed&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Berwick Advertiser&quot;.

=== Relations with Russia ===

There is an apocryphal story that Berwick is (or recently has been) officially at war with Russia. According to a story by George Hawthorne in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 28 December 1966, the London correspondent of &quot;Pravda&quot; visited the Mayor of Berwick, Councillor Robert Knox, and the two made a mutual declaration of peace. Knox said, &quot;Please tell the Russian people through your newspaper that they can sleep peacefully in their beds.&quot; The same story, cited to the Associated Press, appeared in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; of 17 December 1966; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of 18 December 1966; and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; of 22 December 1966. At some point, the real events seem to have been turned into a story of a &quot;Soviet official&quot; having signed a &quot;peace treaty&quot; with Mayor Knox; Knox&#x27;s remark to the &quot;Pravda&quot; correspondent was preserved in this version.

The basis for such status was the claim that Berwick had changed hands several times, was traditionally regarded as a special, separate entity, and some proclamations referred to &quot;England, Scotland and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed&quot;. One such was the declaration of the Crimean War against Russia in 1853, which Queen Victoria supposedly signed as &quot;Victoria, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland, Berwick-upon-Tweed and all British Dominions&quot;. When the Treaty of Paris was signed to conclude the war, &quot;Berwick-upon-Tweed&quot; was left out. This meant that, supposedly, one of Britain&#x27;s smallest towns was officially at war with one of the world&#x27;s largest powers – and the conflict extended by the lack of a peace treaty for over a century. In reality, Berwick-upon-Tweed was not mentioned in either the declaration of war or the final peace treaty and was legally part of the United Kingdom for both.

== Landmarks ==


* Berwick Castle was built in the 13th century and rebuilt in the 1290s. It was in disrepair by the 17th century, and much of it was demolished in the 19th century to make way for the railway. However, substantial ruins remain just outside the town&#x27;s rampart walls to the west by the river.
* Berwick town walls and Tudor ramparts are some of the country&#x27;s finest remaining examples of their type.
* The Old Bridge, 15-span sandstone arch bridge long, built in 1610–1624 for £15,000. The bridge continues to carry road traffic, but in one direction only. The bridge, part of the Great North Road from London to Edinburgh was built by order of James VI and I.
* Holy Trinity Parish Church, unusual for having been built during the Commonwealth of England. It was built in 1648–1652 with stone from the 13th-century castle. It was originally a plain &quot;preaching box&quot;, with no steeple, stained glass or other decorations. Contents include a pulpit thought to have been built for John Knox during his stay in the town. The church was much altered in 1855 with many new windows and the addition of a chancel.
* Berwick Barracks, built 1717–1721, the design attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor.
* Berwick Town Hall, designed by S&amp;J Worrell and built in 1754–1760. The building is neoclassical, and originally the town&#x27;s prison was on the top floor. The tower above the council chamber has a ring of eight bells and a curfew bell. Lester and Pack of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor, third, fourth and treble bells in 1754 and the fifth and sixth bells in 1759. Charles Carr of Smethwick cast the second and curfew bells in 1894. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the seventh bell in 1901.
* Dewars Lane Granary, built in 1769, now restored as a hotel and art gallery.
* Marshall Meadows House, built in 1780 as a country house, is north of the town. It is the most northern hotel in England, just 275 metres from the Scottish border at Marshall Meadows Bay.
* Union Chain Bridge, upstream, from Berwick, was built in 1821 and is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving suspension bridge.
* The Kings Arms Hotel on Hide Hill was built in 1782 and rebuilt in 1845. Charles Dickens stayed there in 1861.
* The Royal Border Bridge, designed by Robert Stephenson and built in 1847–1850 at a cost of £253,000, is a 720-yard-long railway viaduct with 28 arches, carrying the East Coast Main Line 126 feet above the River Tweed. It was opened by Queen Victoria.
* The Corn Exchange in Sandgate, completed in 1858, and converted into apartments in the late 1990s.
* St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Wallace Green was built in 1859 and is one of only eight Church of Scotland congregations in England.
* The Masonic Hall was built in 1872 for the town&#x27;s St David&#x27;s Masonic Lodge for £1,800. The lodge still owns the hall and is also used by other Masonic lodges and orders. It is one of few purpose-built Masonic halls in the country and is a scarce example of Victorian Masonic architecture. It has a large pipe organ built in 1895. The Hall contains many artefacts and documents concerning Freemasonry in the town, which can be traced back to 1643.
* The Royal Tweed Bridge, built in 1925 to carry the A1 road across the Tweed. Its span is , which at the time was the longest concrete span. The A1 now bypasses the town to the west. In the early 2000s, the bridge was renovated, the road and pavement layout revised, and new street lighting added.
* Dewars Lane runs down Back Street just off Bridge Street. Like other Berwick locations, it was painted by L. S. Lowry, who visited Berwick.
* There are numerous sea caves on the coastline to the north of Berwick, with lengths up to 67 metres. The caves are found in the cliffs from Green&#x27;s Haven to the Scottish border at Marshall Meadows Bay.

<doc id="89798" wikidata="Q424102" url="?curid=89798" title="Auditory illusion">
<text>Auditory illusions are illusions of real sound or outside stimulus. These false perceptions are the equivalent of an optical illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or sounds that should not be possible given the circumstance on how they were created.

Humans are fairly susceptible to illusions, despite an innate ability to process complex stimuli. Confirmation bias is believed to be largely responsible for the inaccurate judgments that people make when evaluating information, given that humans typically interpret and recall information that appeals to their own biases. Amongst these misinterpretations, known as illusions, falls the category of auditory illusions. The brain uses multiple senses simultaneously to process information, 
spatial information is processed with greater detail and accuracy in vision than in hearing. Auditory illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic survival tools, differentiate from perfect audio receptors; this shows that it is possible for a human being to hear something that is not there and be able to react to the sound they supposedly heard. When someone is experiencing an auditory illusion, their brain is falsely interpreting its surroundings and distorting their perception of the world around them.

== Causes ==
Many auditory illusions, particularly of music and of speech, result from hearing sound patterns that are highly probable, even though they are heard incorrectly. This is due to the influence of our knowledge and experience of many sounds we have heard. In order to prevent hearing echo created by perceiving multiple sounds coming from different spaces, the human auditory system relates the sounds as being from one source. However, that does not prevent people from being fooled by auditory illusions. Sounds that are found in words are called embedded sounds, and these sounds are the cause of some auditory illusions. A person&#x27;s perception of a word can be influenced by the way they see the speaker&#x27;s mouth move, even if the sound they hear is unchanged. For example, if someone is looking at two people saying &quot;far&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, the word they will hear will be determined by who they look at. If these sounds are played in a loop, the listener will be able to hear different words inside the same sound. People with brain damage can be more susceptible to auditory illusions and they can become more common for that person.

== In music ==
Composers have long been using the spatial components of music to alter the overall sound experienced by the listener. One of the more common methods of sound synthesis is the use of combination tones. Combination tones are illusions that are not physically present as sound waves, but rather, they are created by one&#x27;s own neuromechanics. According to Purwins, auditory illusions have been used effectively by the following: Beethoven (Leonore Overture), Berg (&quot;Wozzeck&quot;), Krenek (&quot;Spiritus Intelligentiae, Sanctus&quot;), Ligeti (Études), Violin Concerto, Double Concerto, for flute, oboe and orchestra), Honegger (&quot;Pacific 231&quot;), and Stahnke (Partota 12).

==Examples==
There are a multitude of examples out in the world of auditory illusions. These are examples of some auditory illusions:
 
*Binaural beats
* The constant spectrum melody
*Deutsch&#x27;s scale illusion
*Electronic voice phenomenon: a special case of auditory pareidolia
*Franssen effect
*Glissando illusion
*Illusory continuity of tones
*Illusory discontinuity
* Hearing a missing fundamental frequency, given other parts of the harmonic series
*Various psychoacoustic tricks of lossy audio compression
*McGurk effect
*Octave illusion/Deutsch&#x27;s high–low illusion
* Auditory pareidolia: hearing indistinct voices in random noise.
* The Shepard–Risset tone or scale, and the Deutsch tritone paradox
* Speech-to-song illusion 
* Yanny or Laurel

<doc id="89802" wikidata="Q162802" url="?curid=89802" title="Agavoideae">
<text>Agavoideae is a subfamily of monocot flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, order Asparagales. It has previously been treated as a separate family, Agavaceae. The group includes many well-known desert and dry-zone types, such as the agaves and yuccas (including the Joshua tree). About 640 species are placed in around 23 genera; they are widespread in the tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions of the world.

==Description and uses==
Species may be succulent or not. In general, Agavoideae leaves occur as rosettes at the end of a woody stem, which may range from extremely short to tree-like heights, as in the Joshua tree. The leaves are parallel-veined, and usually appear long and pointed, often with a hardened spine on the end, and sometimes with additional spines along the margins.

&quot;Agave&quot; species are used to make &quot;tequila, pulque,&quot; and &quot;mezcal&quot;, while others are valued for their fibers. They are quite popular for xeriscaping, as many have showy flowers.

==Systematics==

The taxonomy of the group has varied widely. In the APG III system of 2009, adopted here, the Agavoideae are defined very broadly to include the former family Agavaceae along with other formerly separate families such as Anemarrhenaceae, Chlorogalaceae, Hostaceae, Yuccaceae, Anthericaceae, Hesperocallidaceae, and Chlorogalaceae, based on data from molecular systematics. Stevens comments that &quot;The broad concept of Agavoideae [...] may not seem very satisfactory&quot; but that none of the alternatives is better. Sources prior to 2009 will still have Agavaceae (in varying circumscriptions) as a separate family and may contain varying numbers of other families included in the Agavoideae in the APG III system.

Some genera formerly placed in this group (under whatever name) have been separated off; e.g. &quot;Dracaena&quot;, which superficially resembles some species of &quot;Agave&quot;, is currently placed in the subfamily Nolinoideae.

==Genera==
A partial list of the genera included in the Agavoideae is given below. The reference is to the source that places the genus in this subfamily. As noted above, the genera currently included here have varied widely in their limits and assignment to families and subfamilies; some former family placements other than Agavaceae are found in the literature are given below.

<doc id="89805" wikidata="Q3058816" url="?curid=89805" title="European dragon">
<text>The European dragon is a legendary creature in folklore and mythology among the overlapping
cultures of Europe.

The Roman poet Virgil in his poem &quot;Culex&quot; lines 163–201, describing a shepherd battling a big constricting snake, calls it &quot;&quot; and also &quot;&quot;, showing that in his time the two words probably could mean the same thing.

In and after the early Middle Ages, the European dragon is typically depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long, muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with one or more of: feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes running down its spine, and various exotic decorations.

In folktales, dragon&#x27;s blood often contains unique powers, keeping them alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties. The typical dragon in Christian culture protects a cavern or castle filled with gold and treasure. An evil dragon is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it, and a good one is said to give support or wise advice.

Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground , a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.
Dragons have been mentioned in European literature since antiquity. In some accounts, the hero Sigurð defeats Fáfnir by digging a pit and then lying in wait, piercing his heart with a sword as he passes overhead and slaying him. This concept is also seen in various other dragon stories. In many portrayals of the European dragon, it is shown as a greedy beast who wanted wealth and other valuables. This includes the prominent dragons in Germanic mythology, Fáfnir and the killer of Beowulf.

== Etymology ==



== Classical period==
Roman dragons developed from serpentine Greek ones, combined with the dragons of the Near East, in the context of the hybrid Greek/Eastern Hellenistic culture. From Babylon, the &quot;muš-ḫuššu&quot; was a classic representation of a Near Eastern dragon. St John&#x27;s &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;—Greek literature, not Roman—describes Satan as &quot;a great dragon, flaming red, with seven heads and ten horns&quot;. Much of St John&#x27;s literary inspiration is late Hebrew and Greek, but his dragon is more likely to have symbolized the dragons from the Near East. In the Roman Empire, each military cohort had a particular identifying &quot;signum&quot; (military standard); after the Parthian and Dacian Wars of Trajan in the east, the Dacian Draco military standard entered the Legion with the &quot;Cohors Sarmatarum&quot; and &quot;Cohors Dacorum&quot; (Sarmatian and Dacian cohorts)—a large dragon fixed to the end of a lance, with large, gaping jaws of silver and with the rest of the body formed of colored silk. With the jaws facing into the wind, the silken body inflated and rippled, resembling a windsock.

Several personifications of evil or allusions to dragons in the Old Testament are translated as forms of &quot;draco&quot; in Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate. e.g. Deuteronomy (32:33), Job (30:29), Psalms (73:13, 90:13 &amp; 43:20), Isaiah (13:21, 27:1, 34:13 &amp; 43:20), Jeremiah (9:11), and Malachi (1:3).

Dragons in Greek mythology often guard treasure. For example, Ladon, a hundred-headed dragon, guarded the tree of Hesperides until he was slain by Heracles. Likewise, Python guarded the oracle of Delphi until he was slain by Apollo out of revenge for Python tormenting his mother. The Lernaean Hydra, a multiple-headed serpentine swamp monster killed by Heracles, is said to be a dragon.

In a tale in Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (also called &quot;Metamorphoses of Apuleius&quot;,) a band of travelers ask a shepherd for refreshments. The shepherd asks why they care about refreshments in such a place. An old man asks the travelers if they can help get his son from a well; one of them goes to help. When he does not return to the group, they go search for him. They find a monstrous dragon eating the said man from the group while the old man was nowhere to be seen.

The Roman author Pliny the Elder in his book &quot;Natural History&quot; (book 8, chapters 11 &amp; 13) describes the Indian &quot;drakōn&quot; as a big constricting snake, likely the Indian Python, but described exaggeratedly as able to kill an elephant by constricting its neck.

The Roman author Claudius Aelianus in his book &quot;De Natura Animalium&quot; describes the &quot;draco&quot; as a big constricting snake found in India, presumably the Indian Python, but with its size and strength greatly exaggerated so that it can kill an elephant by constricting its neck; this battle between a &quot;draco&quot; and an elephant is repeated with much embellishment in later descriptions of &quot;dracones&quot; or dragons in bestiaries.

== Middle Ages ==
===Depiction===
During the early Middle Ages, European culture was largely out of contact with classical literature for centuries. During this time there was a gradual change in the usual mental image of the &quot;dragon&quot;, i.e. the Latin &quot;draco&quot; and its equivalents in vernacular languages, which occurred in oral and written literature, including in classical literature. This led to the depiction in this literature of &quot;modern-type&quot; dragons, whose features are described below.

The modern Western image of a dragon developed in western Europe during the Middle Ages through the combination of the snakelike dragons of classical Graeco-Roman literature, references to Near Eastern dragons preserved in the Bible, and European folk traditions including descriptions and drawings of animals named as types of snakes but inaccurately drawn with wings or legs. The period between the 11th and 13th centuries represents the height of European interest in dragons as living creatures.

Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body more like a huge lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and breathing fire from their mouths. This traces back to the continental dragon, commonly referred to as a fire-breathing dragon. The continental, like many other European dragons, has bat-like wings growing from its back.

The Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; refers to a dragon as a &quot;draca&quot; and also as a &quot;wyrm&quot; (worm, or serpent). Its movements are denoted by the Anglo-Saxon verb &quot;bugan&quot;, &quot;to bend&quot;, and it is said to have a venomous bite, and poisonous breath; all of these indicate a snake-like form and movement rather than with a lizard-like or dinosaur-like body as in later depictions, and no legs or wings are mentioned (although it is able to fly); however it shows several dragon features that later became popular: it breathed fire, flew, lived underground, and collected treasure.
An early image of a &quot;modern-style&quot; Western dragon appears in an illustration in the bestiary &quot;MS Harley 3244&quot; from about 1260. It has two pairs of wings and two pairs of legs to go with them, and a tail longer than most modern depictions of dragons, but it clearly displays many of the same distinctive features. Otherwise four-legged dragons are not seen until the fifteenth century, for instance in Lambeth Palace Library MS 6, depicting the fight between a white and a red dragon from Arthurian legend.
Dragons are generally depicted as having an underground lair or cave, or living in rivers. They are envisioned as greedy and gluttonous, with voracious appetites. Dragons are often identified with Satan, due to the references to Satan as a &quot;dragon&quot; in the Book of Revelation.

In European folklore, dragon-like creatures and dragons in Christian literature are usually portrayed as evil, except mainly in Asturian and Welsh folklore and modern fiction. In the modern period and late medieval times, the European dragon is typically depicted as a huge fire-breathing, scaly, and horned lizard-like creature, with wings (usually leathery bat-like, sometimes feathered), two or four legs, and a long muscular tail. It is sometimes shown with one or more of a crest, a fiery mane, ivory spikes running down its spine, and various exotic colourations. Dragon&#x27;s blood often has magical properties. The typical dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with gold and treasure and is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it. Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.

===Legends and tales===
The 12th-century Welsh monk Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts a famous legend in his in which the child prophet Merlin witnesses the Romano-Celtic warlord Vortigern attempting to build a tower on Mount Snowdon to keep safe from the Anglo-Saxons, but the tower keeps being swallowed into the ground. Merlin informs Vortigern that underneath the foundation he has built is a pool with two dragons sleeping in it. Vortigern orders the pool to be drained, exposing a red dragon and a white dragon, who immediately begin fighting. Merlin delivers a prophecy that the white dragon will triumph over the red, symbolizing England&#x27;s conquest of Wales, but declares that the red dragon will eventually return and defeat the white one. This story remained popular throughout the 15th century.

The 13th-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, written in Latin, records the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch, a virgin martyr who, after being tortured for her faith in the Diocletianic Persecution and thrown back into her cell, is said to have been confronted by a monstrous dragon, but she made the sign of the cross and the dragon vanished. In some versions of the story, she is swallowed by the dragon alive and, after making the sign of the cross in the dragon&#x27;s stomach, emerges unharmed - or in another version, after a physical cross she carried irritated the dragon&#x27;s innards.

Fantastic stories were invented in the Middle Ages to explain gargoyles used as waterspouts on buildings. One medieval French legend holds that, in ancient times, a fearsome dragon known as &quot;La Gargouille&quot; had been causing floods and sinking ships on the river Seine, so the people of the town of Rouen would offer the dragon a human sacrifice once each year to appease its hunger. Then, in around 600 AD, a priest named Romanus promised that, if the people would build a church, he would rid them of the dragon. Romanus slew the dragon and its severed head was mounted on the walls of the city as the first gargoyle.

====St George and the Dragon====

The legend of Saint George and the Dragon is recorded as early as the sixth century AD, but the earliest artistic representations of it come from the 11th century and the first full account of it comes from an 11th-century Georgian text. The most famous version of the story from the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; holds that a dragon kept pillaging the sheep of the town of Silene in Libya. After it ate a young shepherd, the people were forced to placate it by leaving two sheep as sacrificial offerings every morning beside the lake where the dragon lived. Eventually, the dragon ate all of the sheep and the people were forced to start offering it their own children. One day, the king&#x27;s own daughter came up in the lottery and, despite the king&#x27;s pleas for her life, she was dressed as a bride and chained to a rock beside the lake to be eaten. Then Saint George arrived and saw the princess. When the dragon arrived to eat her, he stabbed it with his lance and subdued it by making the sign of the cross and tying the princess&#x27;s girdle around its neck. Saint George and the princess led the now docile dragon into the town and George promised to kill it if the townspeople would convert to Christianity. All the townspeople converted and Saint George killed the dragon with his sword. In some versions, Saint George marries the princess, but, in others, he continues wandering.

===Heraldry===
Dragons are prominent in medieval heraldry. Uther Pendragon was famously said to have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal coat of arms. Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs, but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a &quot;dragon&quot; (with four legs) and a &quot;wyvern&quot; (with two legs). In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence, but in heraldry, they symbolise the overthrowing of the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces. Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a dragon-like creature known as a &quot;cockatrice&quot;. A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster, and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice&#x27;s mortal enemy. A &quot;basilisk&quot; is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a midden by a nine-year-old cockatrice. Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.

==Dragons in specific cultures==
=== Celtic ===
The Celtic dragon may have developed from a horned and poisonous or fire-breathing snake. It is mostly a snake that is transformed into a monster.

The dragon motif is known in Celtic art in diverse styles, and is presumed to have derived from a serpent-like creature in ancient folklore of the Middle East and Greece. Both the Greeks and the Romans considered the serpent to be a guardian spirit, represented on their altars. Western Celtic peoples were familiar with dragons in the pre-Christian age, and native people of Britain are said to have worn Celtic decorations with motifs of dragons on them during the Roman invasion. There is also archaeological evidence that the continental Celts used brooches and pins in the form of a dragon during the La Téne period from to 1 AD. Some suggest that the native Britons of Europe may have brought the dragon with them when they migrated to Britain before the Roman age. The earliest known use of the dragon by the Celts appears in swords and sheaths in the 4th century BC. One example found in Britain is an early Iron Age Celtic sword that features two opposing dragons, queried to be from the Hallstatt culture. Two other swords and scabbards (also from the bottom of the river Thames) are thought to include a dragon pair from the La Tène or Hallstatt cultures. Discovery of Celtic dragon-pairs in the Thames suggests that links existed between Britain and the rest of the Celtic world in the decades around 300 BC. Evidence in coins also shows Celticised dragons in 50–45 BC.

===Germanic===

Dragons, or worms, are prevalent in early Germanic folklore and art, with notable examples being the killer of Beowulf, the central figure of the Völsung Cycle Fáfnir and Jǫrmungandr. In this cultural context, the distinction between snakes and dragons is blurred with both being referred to by the same terms, including and . Other terms often used are the cognates and meaning &quot;dragon, sea serpent or sea monster&quot; which are derived from Proto-Germanic &quot;*drakō&quot;, an early borrowing from Latin &quot;draco&quot; &quot;huge serpent or dragon&quot;. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably with and , although sometimes they are treated as different beings. While in later accounts many dragons are portrayed in these cultures as being winged, this is likely under influence from Southern Europe. In later Northern European folklore, many worms are found that are flightless and resemble large snakes such as the Lambton Worm and the Stoor worm.

While depictions are diverse, several traits are shared amongst many worms, including hoarding gold, and spitting atter and later fire. Depictions of worms are prevalent in early medieval art, notably on runestones, where they often form the band on which the runes are written. Specific worms are also depicted, such as Jǫrmungandr on the Altuna stone and Fáfnir on the Jurby cross, the Hylestad stave church and the Ramsund carving.

=== Welsh===

The red dragon features on, and is the name of, the national flag of Wales (&quot;Y Ddraig Goch&quot;, &quot;the red dragon&quot;). Early Welsh writing associates dragons with war leaders, and in legend, Nennius, in Historia Birttonum, tells of a vision of the red dragon (representing the Britons) and the white dragon (representing the invading Saxons) fighting beneath Dinas Emrys. A version of this particular legend also features in the Mabinogion in the story of &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;.

=== Slavic===
====Alas====
It is said that a very old snake can transform into an ala. Some depictions of alas are confusingly said to have the bodies of women. Other alas look like dragons. The number of heads on an ala may vary. Alas are enemies of the zmeys and it is sometimes said in south Slavic folklore that thunder is a product of alas and zmeys fighting. Alas are considered evil or malevolent, while zmeys are usually considered good or benevolent.

====Zmeys ====

Dragon-like creatures of Slavic mythology hold mixed temperaments towards humans. For example, Drakons (дракон, змей, ламя, (х)ала; dracon, zmey, lamya, ala) in Bulgarian mythology are either male or female, and each gender has a different view of mankind. The female dragon and male dragon, often seen as sister and brother, represent different forces of agriculture. The female dragon represents harsh weather and is the destroyer of crops, the hater of mankind, and is locked in a never-ending battle with her brother. The male dragon protects the humans&#x27; crops from destruction and is generally benevolent to humanity. Fire and water play major roles in Bulgarian dragon lore: the female has water characteristics, while the male is usually a fiery creature. In Bulgarian legend, The drakons are three-headed, winged beings with snake&#x27;s bodies.

In Bulgarian, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Bosnian, Serbian, and Macedonian lore, the dragon-like creature, or &quot;змей&quot; (), &quot;zmey&quot; (), &quot;smok&quot; (), &quot;zmiy&quot; (), (Bosnian zmaj), (), &quot;zmej&quot; (), is generally an evil, four-legged beast with few, if any, redeeming qualities. &quot;Zmeys&quot; are intelligent, but not greatly so, often demanding tribute from villages or small towns in the form of maidens (for food), or gold. Their number of heads ranges from one to seven or sometimes even more, with three- and seven-headed Zmeys being most commonly cited. The heads also regrow if cut off, unless the neck is &quot;treated&quot; with fire (similar to the hydra in Greek mythology). Zmey blood is so poisonous that Earth itself will refuse to absorb it. In Bulgarian mythology these &quot;dragons&quot; are sometimes good, opposing the evil Lamya /ламя/, a beast similar to the &quot;zmey&quot;.

====Smok====
The most famous Polish dragon () is the Wawel Dragon or &quot;Smok Wawelski&quot;, the Dragon of Wawel Hill. It supposedly terrorized ancient Kraków and lived in caves on the Vistula river bank below the Wawel castle. According to lore based on the &quot;Book of Daniel&quot;, it was killed by a boy who offered it a sheepskin filled with sulphur and tar. After devouring it, the dragon became so thirsty that it finally exploded after drinking too much water. In the oldest, 12th-century version of this fantasy tale, written by Wincenty Kadłubek, the dragon was defeated by two sons of a King Krak, Krakus II and Lech II. A metal sculpture of the Wawel Dragon is a well-known tourist sight in Kraków. The Wawel Dragon appears in the coat of arms of the Polish princes, the Piasts of Czersk.

Other dragon-like creatures in Polish folklore include the basilisk, living in cellars of Warsaw, and the Snake King from folk legends, though neither are explicitly dragons.

=== Armenian ===
Վիշապ (&quot;Vishap&quot;) is the Armenian word for &quot;dragon&quot;.

=== Iberian ===
Iberian dragons are almost always evil, such as the Cuélebre, or Cuelebre, a giant winged serpent in the mythology of Asturias and Cantabria in the north of Spain. It usually lives in a cave, guards treasures and keeps nymph-like beings called &quot;xanas&quot; or &quot;anjanas&quot; as prisoners.

There is a legend that a dragon dwelled in the Peña Uruel mountain near Jaca and claimed that it could mesmerise people with its glance, so the young man who decided to kill the beast equipped himself with a shiny shield, so that the dragon&#x27;s glance would be reflected. When the young man arrived at the cave where the dragon lived, he could kill it easily because the dragon mesmerised itself. This legend is very similar to the Greek myth of Medusa.

Herensuge is the name given to the dragon in Basque mythology, meaning &quot;last serpent&quot;. The most famous legend has St. Michael descend from Heaven to kill it, but only once did God agree to accompany him in person.

Sugaar, the Basque male god, is often associated with the serpent or dragon but can take other forms as well. His name can be read as &quot;male serpent&quot;.

Dragons are well known in Catalan myths and legends, in no small part because St. George (Catalan &quot;Sant Jordi&quot;) is the patron saint of Catalonia. Like most mythical reptiles, the Catalan dragon (Catalan &quot;drac&quot;) is an enormous serpent-like creature with four legs and a pair of wings, or rarely, a two-legged creature with a pair of wings, called a wyvern. As in many other parts of the world, the dragon&#x27;s face may be like that of some other animal, such as a lion or a bull. As is common elsewhere, Catalan dragons are fire-breathers, and the dragon-fire is all-consuming. Catalan dragons also can emit a fetid odor, which can rot away anything it touches.

The Catalans also distinguish a &quot;víbria&quot; or &quot;vibra&quot; (cognate with English &quot;viper&quot; and &quot;wyvern&quot;), a female dragon-like creature with two prominent breasts, two claws, two wings and an eagle&#x27;s beak. Dracs, Víbries and other mythological figures used to participate in correfocs during popular celebrations.

In Portuguese mythology, Coca is a female wyvern that battles Saint George on the Corpus Christi holiday. The fighting has a symbolic meaning: when the coca defeats Saint George the crops will be bad and there will be famine and death; when Saint George defeats the coca and cuts off her tongue and ears, the crops will have a good year and it announces prosperity. Still, she is called &quot;saint&quot; coca just as George is called saint, and the people cheer for her.

Another dragon called &quot;drago&quot; is also represented in Portuguese mythology and used to take part in celebrations during the Middle Ages.

=== Italian ===
Wyverns are usually evil in Italy, and there are many stories of wyverns being slain. Dragons also trick demons in Italian legends. The legend of Saint George and the wyvern is well known in Italy, but other saints are also depicted fighting wyverns. For instance, the first bishop of Forlì, Saint Mercurialis, was said to have killed a wyvern to save the city, so he is often depicted in the act of slaying a wyvern. Likewise, the first patron saint of Venice, Saint Theodore of Tyro, was a wyvern-slayer, and a statue representing his slaying of the wyvern still tops one of the two columns in St Mark&#x27;s Square. St. Michael, the patron saint of paratroopers, is also frequently depicted slaying a wyvern.

According to the Golden Legend, compiled by the Italian Jacobus de Voragine, Saint Margaret the Virgin was swallowed by Satan in the shape of a hydra, but she escaped alive when the cross she carried irritated the hydra&#x27;s innards. The Golden Legend, in an atypical moment of scepticism, describes this last incident as &quot;apocryphal and not to be taken seriously&quot; (trans. Ryan, 1.369), which did not prevent the legend from being popular and getting artistic treatments.

More prevalent are the legends about dragons in Italy, particularly in Umbria. One of the most famous wyverns of Italian folklore is Thyrus, a wyvern that besieged Terni in the Middle Ages. One day, a young and brave knight of the noble House of Cittadini, tired of witnessing the death of his fellow citizens and the depopulation of Terni, faced the wyvern and killed it. From that day, the town assumed the creature in its coat of arms, accompanied by a Latin inscription: &quot;Thyrus et amnis dederunt signa Teramnis&quot; (&quot;Thyrus and the river gave their insignia to [the city of] Terni&quot;), that stands under the banner of the town of Terni, honoring this legend.

Another poem tells of another dragon that lived near the village of Fornole, near Amelia, Umbria. Pope Sylvester I arrived in Umbria and freed the population of Fornole from the ferocity of the dragon, pacifying the dragon. Grateful for his deed, the population built a small church dedicated to the saint on the top of the mountain near the dragon&#x27;s lair in the 13th century. In the apse of the church there is a fresco representing the iconography of the saint.
== Heraldry ==
In British heraldry, dragons are depicted as four-legged, distinguishing them from the two-legged wyvern. They always possess wings similar to a bat&#x27;s. Dragons are traditionally depicted with tongues ending in a barbed tip; recent heraldry depicts their tails as ending with a similar barb, but this trait originated after the Tudor period. During and before this era, dragons were always depicted with tails ending in a blunt tip.

In terms of attitude, dragons are typically shown &quot;statant&quot; (with all four legs on the ground), &quot;passant&quot; (with one leg raised), or &quot;rampant&quot; (rearing). They are very rarely depicted as &quot;coward&quot; (with their tail between their legs).

According to heraldic writer Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, the red dragon of Wales on the flag originated with the standard of the 7th-century king Cadwaladr and was used as a supporter by the Tudor dynasty (who were of Welsh origin). Queen Elizabeth, however, preferring gold, changed the color of the dragon supporter from red to gold gules, in parallel to her change of the royal mantle from gules and ermine to gold and ermine. There may be some doubt of the Welsh origin of the dragon supporter of the royal arms, but it certainly was used by King Henry III.

In England, a rampant red dragon (clutching a mace) is still the heraldic symbol of the county of Somerset. The county once formed part of the early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex in western England, which too bore a dragon, or a wyvern, as a symbol. The Wessex beast is usually colored gold in illustrations.

The Welsh flag is blazoned &quot;parti per fess Argent and Vert; a dragon Gules passant&quot;. Welsh rugby teams include the Newport Gwent Dragons and the Cardiff City Blue Dragons.

In continental European heraldry, the term &quot;dragon&quot; covers a greater variety of creatures than it does in British systems, including creatures such as the wyvern, the basilisk and the cockatrice. In German heraldry, the four-legged dragon is referred to as a &quot;Lindwurm&quot;.
In Spain, there are many examples of dragons as heraldic symbols (particularly “dragantes”: two opposing dragon faces biting some figure). Dragons were introduced as heraldic symbols by King Peter IV of Aragon, who used a dragon on his helmet to show that he was the king of Aragon, as a heraldic pun (&quot;Rei d&#x27;Aragón&quot; becoming &quot;Rei&quot; &quot;dragón&quot;; translating in English as &quot;dragon king&quot;).

Historically, the coat of arms of Madrid included, besides a bear with a strawberry tree, a dragon. This dragon has its origin in a dragon, or a serpent according to Mesonero Romanos, that was shown on the keystone in the arch of a gate of the disappeared walls of Madrid known as &quot;&quot;Puerta Cerrada&quot; or &quot;Puerta de la Sierpe&quot;&quot; (Closed Gate or Wyrm Gate in English). In 1582 a fire destroyed the gate. At that time the walls had fallen into disuse, for this reason the gate and the surrounding wall have never been rebuilt. The serpent, become dragon, was retained as informal symbol of Madrid until the 19th century, when it was decided to incorporate the dragon in the coat of arms. The dragon then turned into a griffin, and the griffin disappeared from the coat of arms in 1967, although the heraldic dragon remains carved in stone in many monuments around the city.
A dragon was used as the crest of the greater royal coat of arms of Portugal from at least the 14th century. Later, two wyverns were used as supporters of the shield of the arms of Portugal. In the 19th century, King Peter IV of Portugal granted the city of Porto the incorporation of the dragon crest of the royal coat of arms in its municipal coat of arms, in gratitude for the support given to him by the city during the Liberal Wars. The badge of FC Porto incorporates the old Porto municipal coat of arms with the dragon crest; this is why the dragon was adopted as the animal mascot of the club.

In relatively recent additions to the image of a dragon, the tongue and the tail ended with a barb. The Tudor image of a dragon does no such thing, with the tail being long and pointy. The German Lindwurm seems to be where the English got their figure of a dragon. It is represented as a traditional one with scales, four legs, wings, sharp teeth, and horns.

*Mr. Mainwaring-Ellerker-Onslow&#x27;s house was represented by a sea-dragon. This dragon is normal, in today&#x27;s standards, for half its body and the other half has no hind legs and a large end of the tail. This is closer to the Chinese model of dragons.

*The Duke of Marlborough uses a wyvern sitting erect upon its tail with its claws in the air.

*The crest of the Lancashire family have a crest of the wyvern without wings and the tail knotted.

*While this is comparatively rare, two cockatrices are the supporters to Sir Edmund Charles Nugent.

*The Hydra is a crest comes from the families of Barret, Crespine, and Lownes.

== Modern dragons ==
The emblem books popular from late medieval times through the 17th century often represent the dragon as an emblem of greed. The prevalence of dragons in European heraldry demonstrates that there is more to the dragon than greed.

Agosti Xaho, a romantic myth creator of the 19th century, fused these myths in his own creation of &quot;Leherensuge&quot;, the first and last serpent, that, in his newly coined legend, would arise again some time in the future bringing the rebirth of an independent republic for the Basque people.

Dragons have long been portrayed in modern times as greedy treasure-hoarders, lusting for gold and precious gems. In such stories as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the theft of such treasure sparks a dragon&#x27;s fury. In the fantasy genre, however, there has been a trend of originally depicting dragons in a positive light: as allies instead of enemies, the red dragon of Wales, and the brother dragon of Poland. Dragons are increasingly viewed as friends of humans and as highly intelligent and noble creatures, while still remaining the fearsome beasts of legend. They are frequently shown as guardians and close friends of individual humans.

After the discovery of fossil pterosaurs, European-type dragons are often depicted without front legs, and, when on the ground, standing and walking pterosaur-fashion on their back feet and the wrists of their wings.

===Recent fiction===
Dragons play prominent roles in JRR Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium, particularly in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and in the unconnected &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;.

Many of these modern ideas were first popularised by Anne McCaffrey with her &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series.

Ursula K. Le Guin has prominent dragons in her books about Earthsea.

Later authors such as Christopher Paolini also depicted sympathetic dragon characters in &quot;Eragon&quot;.

Ffyrnig, the Last Great Dragon of &quot;Legend of the Heart Eaters&quot;, the first book in the story of &quot;Jonah and the Last Great Dragon&quot; by M.E.Holley is based on an actual legend of the Welsh Borders, which tells that the last great dragon is asleep under the Radnor Forest, imprisoned there by St. Michael.

 The Efteling has since 1979 an animatronic scene in the Fairytale Forest that depicts an archetypical Western European dragon protecting a treasure from getting stolen by the public. 

Bryan Davis&#x27;s &quot;Dragons in Our Midst&quot; series depicts dragons as noble and kind beasts, having the ability to marry and reproduce with humans.

E. D. Baker&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Frog Princess&quot; series frequently includes dragons, and people who can change between human shape and dragon shape.

The &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; / &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; series includes dragons and dragon-riders.

&quot;How To Train Your Dragon&quot; is a series of twelve children&#x27;s books, written by British author Cressida Cowell. The books are set in a fictional Viking world and focus on the experiences of protagonist Hiccup as he overcomes great obstacles on his journey of Becoming a Hero, the Hard Way.

Tui T. Sutherland&#x27;s book series &quot;Wings of Fire&quot; is set in a dragon-dominant world where five dragonets must complete a prophecy to end a twenty-year-long war.

The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik combines dragons with tropes from the Age of Sail.

<text>A Scout (in some countries a Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or Pathfinder) is a child, usually 10–18 years of age, participating in the worldwide Scouting movement. Because of the large age and development span, many Scouting associations have split this age group into a junior and a senior section. Scouts are organized into troops averaging 20–30 Scouts under the guidance of one or more Scout Leaders or Scoutmasters. Troops subdivide into patrols of about 6–8 Scouts and engage in outdoor and special interest activities. Troops may affiliate with local, national, and international organizations. Some national Scouting associations have special interest programs such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts, outdoor high adventure, Scouting bands, and rider Scouts. In the United States there were around 6 million scouts in 2011.

==Foundation==

After the Second Boer War boys showed considerable interest in &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;, a book about military scouting and wilderness survival written by a hero from that war, Robert Baden-Powell. The book was also used by teachers and youth organizations for instruction and play. Inspired by that interest Baden-Powell wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; for boy readership, which describes the Scout method of outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship training, and personal fitness qualities among youth. At the time, Baden-Powell intended that the scheme would be used by established organizations, in particular the Boys&#x27; Brigade. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols.

Over time, the Scout programme has been reviewed and updated in many of the countries where it is run, and special interest programmes developed such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts, outdoor high adventure, Scouting bands and rider Scouts, but the same core values and principles as Baden-Powell originally envisaged still apply.

===Age groups and sections===

Originally, the Scout program was aimed at 11- to 16-year-old boys. However, the younger brothers of Scouts started to attend Troop meetings, and so the Wolf Cub section was started. It was also evident that young girls wanted to participate in similar activities, but the Edwardian values at the time would not allow young boys and girls to &quot;rough and tumble&quot; together, causing the Guide Movement to be created.
While most Scouts may join a troop after finishing Cub Scouts, this is not required. As Scouts get older, they often seek more challenging and diverse activities. A Scout may later join another affiliated program for older children, such as Exploring, Venturing, or Rovering.

==Activities==
A Scout learns the cornerstones of the Scout method, Scout Promise, and Scout Law. These are designed to instill character, citizenship, personal fitness, and leadership in boys through a structured program of outdoor activities. Common ways to implement the Scout method include spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, as well as emphasizing good citizenship and decision-making that are age-level appropriate. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities are key elements. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, first aid, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.

===Fellowship===
Camping most often occurs on a unit level, such as in the troop, but there are periodic camporees and jamborees. Camporees are events where units from a local area camp together for a weekend. These often occur a couple times a year and usually have a theme, such as pioneering. Jamborees are large events on a national or international level held every four years where thousands of Scouts camp together for one to two weeks. Activities at these events include games, Scoutcraft competitions, patch trading, aquatics, woodcarving, archery, and rifle and shotgun shooting.

For many Scouts, the highlight of the year is spending at least a week in the summer as part of an outdoor activity. This can be a long event such as camping, hiking, sailing, canoeing, or kayaking with the unit or a summer camp operated on a council, state, or provincial level. Scouts attending a summer camp, generally one week during the summer, work on merit badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Some summer camps operate specialty programs, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.

===Personal progression===
A large part, compared to younger and older sections, of the activities are related to personal progression. All Scouting organizations have an advancement program, whereby the Scout learns Scoutcraft, community service, leadership, and explores areas of interest to him. This Badge system or Personal Progressive Scheme is based on two complementary elements:
* Proficiency (Merit) badges, which are intended to encourage the Scout to learn a subject which could be his work or hobby, so cover many different types of activities, not always related to Scouting.
* Class badges or Progress system, which symbolize increasingly difficult levels or successive stages.

Most Scouting associations have a highest badge that require mastering Scoutcraft, leadership, and performing community service. Only a small percentage of Scouts attain them.

==Unit affiliation==

===Troop===
The troop is the fundamental unit of the Scouts. This is the group a Scout joins and via which he participates in Scouting activities, such as camping, backpacking, and canoeing. The troop leadership, youth and adult, organizes and provides support for these activities. It may include as few as a half-dozen Scouts, or as many as seventy or more. Troops usually meet weekly.

===Patrol===
Each troop is divided into patrols of around five to ten Scouts. A patrol&#x27;s independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. For instance, a troop typically holds ordinary meetings as a unit. Patrols&#x27; autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own area for cooking and camping. However, on a high adventure trip which only a small part of the troop attends, divisions between patrols may disappear entirely. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop, but this is more common in some troops than in others. Each patrol has a Patrol Leader (PL) and Patrol Second (PS), or Assistant Patrol Leader (APL). Some troops mix older and younger Scouts in the same patrols, so that the older Scouts can teach the younger ones more effectively, other troops group Scouts by age, so that the members of one patrol have more in common.

===Group===

In most countries a local organisation, a &quot;Scout Group&quot;, combines different sections together into a single body. Scout Groups can consist of any number of sections of the different Age Groups in Scouting and Guiding. Scout Groups can be single sex or have boys and girls in separate and/or mixed-sex sections depending on the group and the national organization. In some countries, the different sections are independent of each other, although they might be sponsored or chartered by the same organisation, such as a church.

==Uniforms==

The Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of Scouting, and is worn at most events. The original uniform, which has created a familiar image in the public eye and had a very military appearance, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed campaign hat.

Uniforms have become much more functional and colorful since the beginning and are now frequently blue, orange, red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long trousers in areas where the culture calls for modesty, and in colder weather. T-shirts and other more casual wear have also replaced the more formal button-up uniforms in many Scouting regions. In some countries Scouts can display their various proficiency (merit) badges on their uniform, while in other countries they can display them on a green sash.

To show the unity of all Scouts, the World Membership Badge (World Crest) or another badge with a fleur-de-lis is a part of all uniforms. Neckerchiefs and Woggles (slides) are still quite common, but not all Scouting associations use them. Patches for leadership positions, ranks, special achievements, patrol- animals, colors or names, troop- or group- numbers or names, and country or regional affiliation are widely used.

<doc id="89811" wikidata="Q163607" url="?curid=89811" title="Angkor">
<text>Angkor ( , &#x27;capital city&#x27;), also known as [[Yasodharapura]] (; ), was the capital city of the Khmer Empire, located in present-day Cambodia. The city and empire flourished from approximately the 9th to the 15th centuries. The city houses the Angkor Wat, one of Cambodia&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions.

The name &quot;Angkor&quot; is derived from &quot;nokor&quot; (), a Khmer word meaning &quot;kingdom&quot; which in turn derived from Sanskrit &quot;nagara&quot; (), meaning &quot;city&quot;. The Angkorian period began in AD 802, when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself a &quot;universal monarch&quot; and &quot;god-king&quot;, and lasted until the late 14th century, first falling under Ayutthayan suzerainty in 1351. A Khmer rebellion against Siamese authority resulted in the 1431 sacking of Angkor by Ayutthaya, causing its population to migrate south to Longvek. The alternate name, Yasodharapura, was derived from the name of the foster mother of Lord Krishna in Hinduism. Hinduism was the largest religion in the ancient Khmer Empire, and many temples were constructed by Khmer kings dedicated to Hindu deities, including Angkor Wat.

The ruins of Angkor are located amid forests and farmland north of the Great Lake (Tonlé Sap) and south of the Kulen Hills, near modern-day Siem Reap city (13°24′N, 103°51′E), in Siem Reap Province. The temples of the Angkor area number over one thousand, ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the Angkor Wat, said to be the world&#x27;s largest single religious monument. Many of the temples at Angkor have been restored, and together, they comprise the most significant site of Khmer architecture. Visitors approach two million annually, and the entire expanse, including Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom is collectively protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The popularity of the site among tourists presents multiple challenges to the preservation of the ruins.

In 2007, an international team of researchers using satellite photographs and other modern techniques concluded that Angkor had been the largest pre-industrial city in the world by surface area, with an elaborate infrastructure system connecting an urban sprawl of at least to the well-known temples at its core. Angkor is considered to be a &quot;hydraulic city&quot; because it had a complicated water management network, which was used for systematically stabilizing, storing, and dispersing water throughout the area. This network is believed to have been used for irrigation in order to offset the unpredictable monsoon season and to also support the increasing population. Although the size of its population remains a topic of research and debate, newly identified agricultural systems in the Angkor area may have supported between 750,000 and one million people.

== Historical overview ==

=== Seat of the Khmer Empire ===
The Angkorian period may have begun shortly after 800 AD, when the Khmer King Jayavarman II announced the independence of Kambujadesa (Cambodia) from Java. According to Sdok Kok Thom inscription, circa 781 Indrapura was the first capital of Jayavarman II, located in Banteay Prei Nokor, near today&#x27;s Kompong Cham. After he eventually returned to his home, the former kingdom of Chenla, he quickly built up his influence, conquered a series of competing kings, and in 790 became king of a kingdom called Kambuja by the Khmer. He then moved his court northwest to Mahendraparvata, in present day Kulen mountains, inland north from the great lake of Tonle Sap.

He also established the city of Hariharalaya (now known as Roluos) at the northern end of Tonlé Sap. Through a program of military campaigns, alliances, marriages and land grants, he achieved a unification of the country bordered by China to the north, Champa (now Central Vietnam) to the east, the ocean to the south and a place identified by a stone inscription as &quot;the land of cardamoms and mangoes&quot; to the west. In 802, Jayavarman articulated his new status by declaring himself &quot;universal monarch&quot; (&quot;chakravartin&quot;) and, in a move that was to be imitated by his successors and that linked him to the cult of Siva, taking on the epithet of &quot;god-king&quot; (&quot;devaraja&quot;). Before Jayavarman, Cambodia had consisted of a number of politically independent principalities collectively known to the Chinese by the names Funan and Chenla.

In 889, Yasovarman ascended to the throne. A great king and an accomplished builder, he was celebrated by one inscription as &quot;a lion-man; he tore the enemy with the claws of his grandeur; his teeth were his policies; his eyes were the Veda.&quot; Near the old capital of Hariharalaya, Yasovarman constructed a new city, called Yasodharapura, centered on the hill and temple of Phnom Bakheng. In the tradition of his predecessors, he also constructed a massive reservoir called baray.

The significance of such reservoirs has been debated by modern scholars, some of whom have seen in them a means of irrigating rice fields, and others of whom have regarded them as religiously charged symbols of the great mythological oceans surrounding Mount Meru, the abode of the gods. The mountain, in turn, was represented by an elevated temple, in which the &quot;god-king&quot; was represented by a lingam. In accordance with this cosmic symbolism, Yasovarman built his central temple on a low hill known as Phnom Bakheng, surrounding it with a moat fed from the baray. He also built numerous other Hindu temples and ashrams, or retreats for ascetics.

Over the next 300 years, between 900 and 1200, the Khmer Empire produced some of the world&#x27;s most magnificent architectural masterpieces in the area known as Angkor. Most are concentrated in an area approximately east to west and north to south, although the Angkor Archaeological Park, which administers the area, includes sites as far away as Kbal Spean, about to the north. Some 72 major temples or other buildings are found within this area, and the remains of several hundred additional minor temple sites are scattered throughout the landscape beyond.

Because of the low-density and dispersed nature of the medieval Khmer settlement pattern, Angkor lacks a formal boundary, and its extent is therefore difficult to determine. However, a specific area of at least beyond the major temples is defined by a complex system of infrastructure, including roads and canals that indicate a high degree of connectivity and functional integration with the urban core. In terms of spatial extent (although not in terms of population), this makes it the largest urban agglomeration in recorded history prior to the Industrial Revolution, easily surpassing the nearest claim by the Maya city of Tikal. At its peak, the city occupied an area greater than modern Paris, and its buildings use far more stone than all of the Egyptian structures combined.

=== Construction of Angkor Wat ===
The single largest temple of the Angkorian region, Angkor Wat, was built between 1113 and 1150 by King Suryavarman II. Suryavarman ascended to the throne after prevailing in a battle with a rival prince. An inscription says that, in the course of combat, Suryavarman leapt onto his rival&#x27;s war elephant and killed him, just as the mythical bird-man Garuda slays a serpent.

After consolidating his political position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into the construction of Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with the tradition of the Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond.

The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very much in evidence. The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting cross-legged on an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.

=== Jayavarman VII ===

Following the death of Suryavarman around 1150 AD, the kingdom fell into a period of internal strife. Its neighbors to the east, the Cham of what is now southern Vietnam, took advantage of the situation in 1177 to launch a water-borne invasion up the Mekong River and across Tonlé Sap. The Cham forces were successful in sacking the Khmer capital of Yasodharapura and in killing the reigning king. However, a Khmer prince who was to become King Jayavarman VII rallied his people and defeated the Cham in battles on the lake and on the land. In 1181, Jayavarman assumed the throne. He was to be the greatest of the Angkorian kings.

Over the ruins of Yasodharapura, Jayavarman constructed the walled city of Angkor Thom, as well as its geographic and spiritual center, the temple known as the Bayon. Bas-reliefs at the Bayon depict not only the king&#x27;s battles with the Cham, but also scenes from the life of Khmer villagers and courtiers. Jayavarman oversaw the period of Angkor&#x27;s most prolific construction, which included building of the well-known temples of Ta Prohm and Preah Khan, dedicating them to his parents.

This massive program of construction coincided with a transition in the state religion from Hinduism to Mahayana Buddhism, since Jayavarman himself had adopted the latter as his personal faith. During Jayavarman&#x27;s reign, Hindu temples were altered to display images of the Buddha, and Angkor Wat briefly became a Buddhist shrine. Following his death, the revival of Hinduism as the state religion included a large-scale campaign of desecrating Buddhist images, and continued until Theravada Buddhism became established as the land&#x27;s dominant religion from the 14th century.

=== Zhou Daguan ===
The year 1296 marked the arrival at Angkor of the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan representing the Yuan dynasty. Zhou&#x27;s one-year sojourn in the Khmer capital during the reign of King Indravarman III is historically significant, because he penned a still-surviving account, &quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot;, of approximately forty pages detailing his observations of Khmer society. Some of the topics he addressed in the account were those of religion, justice, kingship, societal norms, agriculture, slavery, birds, vegetables, bathing, clothing, tools, draft animals, and commerce.

In one passage, he described a royal procession consisting of soldiers, numerous servant women and concubines, ministers and princes, and finally, &quot;the sovereign, standing on an elephant, holding his sacred sword in his hand.&quot; Together with the inscriptions that have been found on Angkorian stelae, temples and other monuments, and with the bas-reliefs at the Bayon and Angkor Wat, Zhou&#x27;s journal is the most important source of information about everyday life at Angkor. Filled with vivid anecdotes and sometimes incredulous observations of a civilization that struck Zhou as colorful and exotic, it is an entertaining travel memoir as well.
=== End of the Angkorian period ===

The end of the Angkorian period is generally set as 1431, the year Angkor was sacked and looted by Suphannaphum-Mon dynasty of Ayutthaya invaders, though the civilization already had been in decline in the 13th and 14th centuries. During the course of the 15th century, nearly all of Angkor was abandoned, except for Angkor Wat, which remained a Buddhist shrine.
Several theories have been advanced to account for the decline and abandonment of Angkor:

==== War with the Ayutthaya Kingdom ====

It is widely believed that the abandonment of the Khmer capital occurred as a result of Ayutthaya invasions. Ongoing civil wars with the Lavo-Khmer and Suphannaphum-Mon dynasty of Ayutthaya were already sapping the strength of Angkor at the time of Zhou Daguan toward the end of the 13th century. In his memoirs, Zhou reported that the country had been completely devastated by such a war, in which the entire population had been obligated to participate.

After the collapse of Angkor in 1431, many statues were taken to the Ayutthaya capital of Ayutthaya in the west. Others departed for the new center of Khmer society at Longvek, southeast of Angkor in Kampong Tralach district. The official capital later moved, first in 1618 to Oudong around from Phnom Penh in Ponhea Leu District, and eventually in 1865 to the present site of Phnom Penh.

==== Erosion of the state religion ====
Some scholars have connected the decline of Angkor with the conversion of the Khmer Empire to Theravada Buddhism following the reign of Jayavarman VII, arguing that this religious transition eroded the Hindu concept of kingship that underpinned the Angkorian civilization. According to Angkor scholar George Coedès, Theravada Buddhism&#x27;s denial of the ultimate reality of the individual served to sap the vitality of the royal personality cult which had provided the inspiration for the grand monuments of Angkor. The vast expanse of temples required an equally large body of workers to maintain them; at Ta Prohm, a stone carving states that 12,640 people serviced that single temple complex. Not only could the spread of Buddhism have eroded this workforce, but it could have also affected the estimated 300,000 agricultural workers required to feed them all.

==== Neglect of public works ====
According to Coedès, the weakening of Angkor&#x27;s royal government by ongoing war and the erosion of the cult of the &quot;devaraja&quot;, undermined the government&#x27;s ability to carry out important public works, such as the construction and maintenance of the waterways essential for irrigation of the rice fields upon which Angkor&#x27;s large population depended for its sustenance. As a result, Angkorian civilization suffered from a reduced economic base, and the population was forced to scatter.

==== Natural disaster ====

Other scholars attempting to account for the rapid decline and abandonment of Angkor have hypothesized natural disasters such as disease (Bubonic Plague), earthquakes, inundations, or drastic climate changes as the relevant agents of destruction. A study of tree rings in Vietnam produced a record of early monsoons that passed through this area. From this study, we can tell that during the 14th–15th centuries monsoons were weakened and eventually followed by extreme flooding. Their inability to adapt their flooding infrastructure may have led to its eventual decline.

Recent research by Australian archaeologists suggests that the decline may have been due to a shortage of water caused by the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age. LDEO dendrochronological research has established tree-ring chronologies indicating severe periods of drought across mainland Southeast Asia in the early 15th century, raising the possibility that Angkor&#x27;s canals and reservoirs ran dry and ended expansion of available farmland.

=== Restoration, preservation, and threats ===

A 16th century Portuguese friar, António da Madalena, was the first recorded European visitor to visit Angkor Wat in 1586. By the 17th century, Angkor Wat was not completely abandoned. Fourteen inscriptions from the 17th century testify to Japanese settlements alongside those of the remaining Khmer. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year there in 1632.

While Angkor was known to the local Khmer and was shown to European visitors; Henri Mouhot in 1860 and Anna Leonowens in 1865, it remained cloaked by the forest until the end of the 19th century. European archeologists such as Louis Delaporte and ethnologists such as Adolf Bastian visited the site and popularized the site in Europe. This eventually led to a long restoration process by French archaeologists.

From 1907 to 1970, work was under the direction of the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient, which cleared away the forest, repaired foundations, and installed drains to protect the buildings from water damage. In addition, scholars associated with the school including George Coedès, Maurice Glaize, Paul Mus, Philippe Stern and others initiated a program of historical scholarship and interpretation that is fundamental to the current understanding of Angkor.


Work resumed after the end of the Cambodian Civil War and, since 1993, has been jointly co-ordinated by India, Germany, Japan and UNESCO through the International Co-ordinating Committee on the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), while Cambodian work is carried out by the Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap (APSARA), created in 1995. Some temples have been carefully taken apart stone by stone and reassembled on concrete foundations, in accordance with the method of anastylosis.

The World Monuments Fund has aided Preah Khan, the Churning of the Sea of Milk (a 49-meter-long bas-relief frieze in Angkor Wat), Ta Som, and Phnom Bakheng. International tourism to Angkor has increased significantly in recent years, with visitor numbers reaching around 2 million a year by 2014. This poses additional conservation problems but has also provided financial assistance to the restoration effort.

==== Water-table dropping ====
With the increased growth in tourism at Angkor, new hotels and restaurants are being built to accommodate such growth. Each new construction project drills underground to reach the water table, which has a limited storage capacity. This demand on the water table could undermine the stability of the sandy soils under the monuments at Angkor, leading to cracks, fissures and collapses. Making matters worse, the peak tourist season corresponds with Cambodia&#x27;s dry season, which leads to excessive pumping of ground water when it is least replenished naturally.

==== Looting ====
Looting was once a threat to the Angkor archaeological landscape. According to APSARA, the official Cambodian agency charged with overseeing the management of Angkor, commenting in 2005, &quot;vandalism has multiplied at a phenomenal rate, employing local populations to carry out the actual thefts, heavily armed intermediaries transport objects, often in tanks or armored personnel carriers, often for sale across the Cambodian border.&quot;. Theft of archaeological objects has been greatly reduced in Cambodia since those comments were made.

==== Unsustainable tourism ====

The increasing number of tourists, around two million per year, exerts pressure on the archaeological sites at Angkor by walking and climbing on the (mostly) sandstone monuments at Angkor. This direct pressure created by unchecked tourism is expected to cause significant damage to the monuments in the future.

In sites such as Angkor, tourism is inevitable. Therefore, the site management team cannot exclusively manage the site. The team has to manage the flow of people. Millions of people visit Angkor each year, making the management of this flow vital to the quickly decaying structures. Western tourism to Angkor began in the 1970s. The sandstone monuments and Angkor are not made for this type of heightened tourism.

Moving forward, UNESCO and local authorities at the site are in the process of creating a sustainable plan for the future of the site. Since 1992, UNESCO has moved towards conserving Angkor. Thousands of new archaeological sites have been discovered by UNESCO, and the organization has moved towards protected cultural zones. Two decades later, over 1000 people are employed full-time at the site for cultural sensitivity reasons. Part of this movement to limit the impacts of tourism has been to only open certain areas of the site.

However, much of the 1992 precautionary measures and calls for future enforcement have fallen through. Both globally and locally the policy-making has been successful, but the implementation has failed for several reasons. First, there are conflicts of interest in Cambodia. While the site is culturally important to them, Cambodia is a poor country.

Tourism is a vital part to the Cambodian economy, and shutting down parts of Angkor, the largest tourist destination in the country, is not an option. A second reason stems from the government&#x27;s inability to organize around the site. The Cambodian government has failed in organizing a robust team of cultural specialists and archaeologists to service the site.

==== COVID-19 ====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of visitors resulted in 10,000 people working in the Cambodian tourist trade being out of work.

== Religious history ==
Historical Angkor was more than a site for religious art and architecture. It was the site of vast cities that served all the needs of the Khmer people. Aside from a few old bridges, however, all of the remaining monuments are religious edifices. In Angkorian times, all non-religious buildings, including the residence of the king himself, were constructed of perishable materials, such as wood, &quot;because only the gods had a right to residences made of stone&quot;. Similarly, the vast majority of the surviving stone inscriptions are about the religious foundations of kings and other potentates. As a result, it is easier to write the history of Angkorian state religion than it is to write that of just about any other aspect of Angkorian society.

Several religious movements contributed to the historical development of religion at Angkor:
* Indigenous religious cults mixed with Shaivism, including those centered on worship of the ancestors and of the lingam;
* A royal cult of personality, identifying the king with the deity, characteristic not only of Angkor, but of other Hindu civilizations in southeast Asia, such as Champa and Java;
* Hinduism, especially Shaivism, the form of Hinduism focused on the worship of Shiva and the lingam as the symbol of Shiva, but also Vaishnavism, the form of Hinduism focussed on the worship of Vishnu;
* Buddhism, in both its Mahayana and Theravada varieties.

=== Pre-Angkorian religion ===

The religion of pre-Angkorian Cambodia, known to the Chinese as Funan (1st century AD to ca. 550) and Chenla (ca. 550 – ca. 800 AD), included elements of Hinduism, Buddhism and indigenous ancestor cults.

Temples from the period of Chenla bear stone inscriptions, in both Sanskrit and Khmer, naming both Hindu and local ancestral deities, with Shiva supreme among the former. The cult of Harihara was prominent; Buddhism was not, because, as reported by the Chinese pilgrim Yi Jing, a &quot;wicked king&quot; had destroyed it. Characteristic of the religion of Chenla also was the cult of the lingam, or stone phallus that patronized and guaranteed fertility to the community in which it was located.

=== Shiva and the lingam ===
The Khmer king Jayavarman II, whose assumption of power around 800 AD marks the beginning of the Angkorian period, established his capital at a place called Hariharalaya (today known as Roluos), at the northern end of the great lake, Tonlé Sap. Harihara is the name of a deity that combines the essence of Vishnu (Hari) with that of Shiva (Hara) and that was much favored by the Khmer kings. Jayavarman II&#x27;s adoption of the epithet &quot;devaraja&quot; (god-king) signified the monarch&#x27;s special connection with Shiva.

The beginning of the Angkorian period was also marked by changes in religious architecture. During the reign of Jayavarman II, the single-chambered sanctuaries typical of Chenla gave way to temples constructed as a series of raised platforms bearing multiple towers. Increasingly impressive temple pyramids came to represent Mount Meru, the home of the Hindu gods, with the moats surrounding the temples representing the mythological oceans.&gt;
 Typically, a lingam served as the central religious image of the Angkorian temple-mountain. The temple-mountain was the center of the city, and the lingam in the main sanctuary was the focus of the temple. The name of the central lingam was the name of the king himself, combined with the suffix &quot;-esvara&quot;, which designated Shiva. Through the worship of the lingam, the king was identified with Shiva, and Shaivism became the state religion.

Thus, an inscription dated 881 AD indicates that king Indravarman I erected a lingam named &quot;Indresvara&quot;. Another inscription tells us that Indravarman erected eight lingams in his courts and that they were named for the &quot;eight elements of Shiva&quot;. Similarly, Rajendravarman, whose reign began in 944 AD, constructed the temple of Pre Rup, the central tower of which housed the royal lingam called &quot;Rajendrabhadresvara&quot;.

=== Vaishnavism ===
In the early days of Angkor, the worship of Vishnu was secondary to that of Shiva. The relationship seems to have changed with the construction of Angkor Wat by King Suryavarman II as his personal mausoleum at the beginning of the 12th century. The central religious image of Angkor Wat was an image of Vishnu, and an inscription identifies Suryavarman as &quot;Paramavishnuloka&quot;, or &quot;he who enters the heavenly world of Vishnu&quot;. Religious syncretism, however, remained thoroughgoing in Khmer society: the state religion of Shaivism was not necessarily abrogated by Suryavarman&#x27;s turn to Vishnu, and the temple may well have housed a royal lingam.

Furthermore, the turn to Vaishnavism did not abrogate the royal personality cult of Angkor, by which the reigning king was identified with the deity. According to Angkor scholar Georges Coedès, &quot;Angkor Wat is, if you like, a vaishnavite sanctuary, but the Vishnu venerated there was not the ancient Hindu deity nor even one of the deity&#x27;s traditional incarnations, but the king Suryavarman II posthumously identified with Vishnu, consubstantial with him, residing in a mausoleum decorated with the graceful figures of apsaras just like Vishnu in his celestial palace&quot;. Suryavarman proclaimed his identity with Vishnu, just as his predecessors had claimed consubstantiation with Shiva.

=== Mahayana Buddhism ===
In the last quarter of the 12th century, King Jayavarman VII departed radically from the tradition of his predecessors when he adopted Mahayana Buddhism as his personal faith. Jayavarman also made Buddhism the state religion of his kingdom when he constructed the Buddhist temple known as the Bayon at the heart of his new capital city of Angkor Thom. In the famous face towers of the Bayon, the king represented himself as the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara moved by compassion for his subjects. Thus, Jayavarman was able to perpetuate the royal personality cult of Angkor, while identifying the divine component of the cult with the bodhisattva rather than with Shiva.

=== Hindu restoration ===
The Hindu restoration began around 1243 AD, with the death of Jayavarman VII&#x27;s successor, Indravarman II. The next king, Jayavarman VIII, was a Shaivite iconoclast who specialized in destroying Buddhist images and in reestablishing the Hindu shrines that his illustrious predecessor had converted to Buddhism. During the restoration, the Bayon was made a temple to Shiva, and its central 3.6 meter tall statue of the Buddha was cast to the bottom of a nearby well. Everywhere, cultist statues of the Buddha were replaced by lingams.

=== Religious pluralism ===

When Chinese traveller Zhou Daguan came to Angkor in AD 1296, he found what he took to be three separate religious groups. The dominant religion was that of Theravada Buddhism. Zhou observed that the monks had shaven heads and wore yellow robes. The Buddhist temples impressed Zhou with their simplicity. He noted that the images of Buddha were made of gilded plaster.

The other two groups identified by Zhou appear to have been those of the Brahmans and of the Shaivites. About the Brahmans, Zhou had little to say, except that they were often employed as high officials. Of the Shaivites, whom he called &quot;Taoists&quot;, Zhou wrote, &quot;the only image which they revere is a block of stone analogous to the stone found in shrines of the god of the soil in China&quot;.

=== Theravada Buddhism ===
During the course of the 13th century, Theravada Buddhism transmitted through the Mon kingdoms of Dvaravati and Haripunchai made its appearance at Angkor. Gradually, it became the dominant religion of Cambodia, displacing both Mahayana Buddhism and Shaivism. The practice of Theravada Buddhism at Angkor continues until this day.

<text>George Vitelle &quot;Papa Jack&quot; Laine (September 21, 1873 – June 1, 1966) was an American musician and a pioneering band leader in New Orleans in the years from the Spanish–American War to World War I. He was often credited for training many musicians who would later become successful in jazz music.

Laine&#x27;s Reliance Brass Band was the first to fuse European, African, and Latin music. The earliest jazz musicians can be traced back to playing in the Reliance Brass Band or being influenced by those who had.

Many of the New Orleans musicians who first spread jazz around the United States in the 1910s and 1920s got their start in Laine&#x27;s marching band, including the members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band.

== Career ==
Laine was a drummer, but he was more noted for his skills at arranging and booking bands. Laine&#x27;s musicians included individuals from most of New Orleans&#x27; many ethnic groups: African American, English, French, German, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Latin American, Scottish, etc. He started leading bands in 1885 before the Jim Crow laws went into effect in New Orleans.

Due to the diverse background of many of his band&#x27;s members, a broad range of ideas developed and fused, leading to the early beginnings of jazz music.

Even after segregation laws started demanding &quot;whites&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; be kept separate, Laine continued to hire light- and medium light-skinned African-American musicians, claiming that they were &quot;Cuban&quot; or &quot;Mexican&quot; if any segregationist tried to start trouble. Therefore, his band attracted a large and diverse group of people such as Mexican clarinetist Lorenzo Tio, Sr., a pioneer of the jazz solo. Laine believed music brought people together.

Laine retired from the music booking business by 1920, but he was interviewed a number of times, providing first-hand accounts of the early days of the development of New Orleans jazz.

On January 1, 1951, Laine was made an Honorary Life Member and given the title of &quot;Father of White Jazz&quot; by the New Orleans Jazz Club.

== List of musicians hired by Laine to play in his bands ==

Laine hired well over 100 musicians to play in his bands, including the following:

<text>The 13th Warrior is a 1999 American historical fiction action film based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, which is a loose adaptation of the tale of &quot;Beowulf&quot; combined with Ahmad ibn Fadlan&#x27;s historical account of the Volga Vikings.

It stars Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan, as well as Diane Venora and Omar Sharif. It was directed by John McTiernan; Crichton directed some uncredited reshoots. The film was produced by McTiernan, Crichton, and Ned Dowd, with Andrew G. Vajna, James Biggam and Ethan Dubrow as executive producers.

Production and marketing costs reportedly ranged from $100–$160 million, but it grossed $61 million at the box office worldwide, becoming the biggest box office bomb of 1999, with losses of up to $129 million. Despite its critical and box office failure, the film has since cultivated a devoted cult following, and is credited with pioneering a Muslim hero in Hollywood blockbusters.

==Plot==

Ahmad ibn Fadlan is a court poet of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtadir of Baghdad until his amorous encounter with the wife of an influential noble gets him exiled as an &quot;ambassador&quot; to the Volga Bulgars. Traveling with his father&#x27;s old friend, Melchisidek, his caravan is saved from Tatar raiders by the appearance of Norsemen. He takes refuge at their settlement on the Volga River, and communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, one of the Norsemen, who happens to speak Latin. From Herger, both learn that the celebration being held by the Norsemen is in fact the precursor to a funeral for their recently-deceased king. Herger also introduces them to one of the king&#x27;s sons, Buliwyf. Ahmad and Melchisidek witness a fight in which Buliwyf kills his brother in self-defense, which establishes Buliwyf as heir apparent. That is followed by the funeral of the dead king, who is traditionally cremated on a Viking ship, set adrift with a female slave who offers to sacrifice herself and accompany him to Valhalla, the Norse afterlife (or &quot;heaven&quot;).

The next day, the young Prince Wulfgar enters the camp to request Buliwyf&#x27;s aid; his father, King Hrothgar, has asked for assistance, as his lands in the far north are under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The &quot;angel of death&quot;, a völva (wisewoman), says that the mission will be successful but only if thirteen warriors face this danger, and the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is automatically and unwillingly recruited.

Ahmad is initially treated indifferently by the Norsemen, but they mock his smaller Arabian horse. However, he earns a measure of respect by quickly learning their language as he starts mentally translating it into Arabic, demonstration of horsemanship, and his ability to write. Buliwyf, already himself a polyglot, asks Ahmad to teach him the Arabic script, which cements their mutual goodwill. Buliwyf sees Ahmad&#x27;s analytic ways as an asset to their quest.

Reaching Hrothgar&#x27;s kingdom, they confirm that their foe is indeed the ancient &quot;Wendol&quot;, fiends who come with the mist to kill and take human heads. While the group searches through a raided cabin, they find a Venus figurine, which is said to represent the &quot;Mother of the Wendol&quot;. On the first night, the warriors Hyglak and Ragnar die. After a string of clashes, Buliwyf&#x27;s band determine that the Wendol are human cannibals, who are clad to appear like bears, live like bears, and think of themselves as bears.

The warriors&#x27; numbers dwindling, having also lost Skeld, Halga, Roneth, and Rethel, and their positions all but indefensible, they consult another völva of the village. She tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, specifically the &quot;Mother of the Wendol&quot;, and their warlord, who wears &quot;the horns of power&quot;. Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol caves and kill the Mother but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by a claw attached to her hand, dipped in poison.

Ahmad and the last of the Norse warriors escape the caves but without the injured Helfdane, who opts to stay behind and fight. They return to the village to prepare for a last stand. Buliwyf staggers outside before the battle and inspires the warriors with a Viking prayer for the honored dead who will enter Valhalla. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol warlord, defeats them, and succumbs to the poison.

Ahmad witnesses Buliwyf&#x27;s royal funeral alongside the four surviving members of the 13 (Herger, Weath, Edgtho, and Haltaf) before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to &quot;become a man and a useful servant of God&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Originally titled &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, production began in the summer of 1997, but the film went through several re-edits after test audiences had not reacted well to the initial cut. Crichton took over as director himself because of the poor test audience reception, causing the release date to be pushed back over a year. The film was recut, and a new ending along with a new score was added. Graeme Revell was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith as composer. The title was changed to &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;. McTiernan has since gone on record as defending the film, stating the finished product was not entirely different from what he shot along with stating that he had originally wanted to do the film with Michael Keaton in mind for the lead role.

The budget, which was originally around $85 million, reportedly soared to $100 million before principal photography concluded. With all of the re-shoots and promotional expenses, the total cost of the film was rumored to be as high as $160 million, which, given its lackluster box office take (earning US$61.7 million worldwide), made for a loss of $70–130 million.

==Release==
The film was pre-sold internationally by Buena Vista Film Sales.

==Reception==
The film debuted at No. 2 on its opening weekend behind &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

&quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; holds a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews. The consensus is: &quot;Atmospheric, great sets and costumes, but thin plot.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, remarking that it &quot;lumber[s] from one expensive set-piece to the next without taking the time to tell a story that might make us care.&quot; Conversely, James Berardinelli gave &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a solid offering&quot; that &quot;delivers an exhilarating 100 minutes&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it A− and called it &quot;the most unexpectedly audacious, exhilarating, and wildly creative adventure thriller I have seen in ages&quot;.

The outcome of the film&#x27;s production disappointed Omar Sharif so much that he temporarily retired from film acting, not taking a role in another major film until 2003&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot;:
:&quot;After my small role in &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, I said to myself, &#x27;Let us stop this nonsense, these meal tickets that we do because it pays well.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Unless I find a stupendous film that I love and that makes me want to leave home to do, I will stop.&#x27; Bad pictures are very humiliating, I was really sick. It is terrifying to have to do the dialogue from bad scripts, to face a director who does not know what he is doing, in a film so bad that it is not even worth exploring.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The original soundtrack was composed by Graeme Revell and featured the Dead Can Dance singer Lisa Gerrard. The score was rejected by Michael Crichton and was replaced by one composed by Crichton&#x27;s usual collaborator, Jerry Goldsmith.

<text>Ahmad ibn Fadlan ibn al-Abbas al-Baghdadi () or simply known as Ibn Fadlan, was a 10th-century traveler from Baghdad, Abbasid Caliphate, famous for his account of his travels as a member of an embassy of the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir to the king of the Volga Bulgars, known as his &quot;risāla&quot; (&quot;account&quot; or &quot;journal&quot;).

His account is most notable for providing a detailed description of the Volga Vikings, including eyewitness accounts of life as part of a trade caravan and witnessing a ship burial. He also notably described the lifestyle of the Oghuz Turks while the Khazars, Cumans, and Pechenegs were still around.

Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s detailed writings have been cited by numerous historians. They have also inspired entertainment works, including Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;.

==Biography==
===Background===
Ahmad ibn Fadlan was described as an Arab in contemporaneous sources. However, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; and Richard N. Frye add that nothing can be said with certainty about his origin, his ethnicity, his education, or even the dates of his birth and death.

Primary source documents and historical texts show that Ahmad Ibn Fadlan was a &quot;faqih&quot;, an expert in Islamic jurisprudence and faith, in the court of the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadir. It appears certain from his writing that prior to his departure on his historic mission, he had already been serving for some time in the court of al-Muqtadir. Other than the fact that he was both a traveler and a theologian in service of the Abbasid Caliphate, little is known about Ahmad Ibn Fadlan prior to 921 and his self-reported travels.

===The embassy===
Ibn Fadlan was sent from Baghdad in 921 to serve as the secretary to an ambassador from the Abbasid Caliph al-Muqtadir to the iltäbär (vassal-king under the Khazars) of the Volga Bulgaria, Almış.

On 21 June 921 (11 &quot;safar&quot; AH 309), a diplomatic party led by Susan al-Rassi, a eunuch in the caliph&#x27;s court, left Baghdad. Primarily, the purpose of their mission was to explain Islamic law to the recently converted Bulgar peoples living on the eastern bank of the Volga River in what is now Russia. Additionally, the embassy was sent in response to a request by the king of the Volga Bulgars to help them against their enemies, the Khazars. Ibn Fadlan served as the group&#x27;s religious advisor and lead counselor for Islamic religious doctrine and law.

Ahmad Ibn Fadlan and the diplomatic party utilized established caravan routes toward Bukhara, now part of Uzbekistan, but instead of following that route all the way to the east, they turned northward in what is now northeastern Iran. Leaving the city of Gurgan near the Caspian Sea, they crossed lands belonging to a variety of Turkic peoples, notably the Khazar Khaganate, Oghuz Turks on the east coast of the Caspian, the Pechenegs on the Ural River and the Bashkirs in what is now central Russia, but the largest portion of his account is dedicated to the Rus, i.e. the Varangians (Vikings) on the Volga trade route. All told, the delegation covered some 4000 kilometers (2500 mi).

Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s envoy reached the Volga Bulgar capital on 12 May 922 (12 &quot;muharram&quot; AH 310). 
When they arrived, Ibn Fadlan read aloud a letter from the caliph to the Bulgar Khan and presented him with gifts from the caliphate. At the meeting with the Bulgar ruler, Ibn Fadlan delivered the caliph&#x27;s letter, but was criticized for not bringing with him the promised money from the caliph to build a fortress as defense against enemies of the Bulgars.

==Ethnographic writing==

===Manuscript tradition===
For a long time, only an incomplete version of the account was known, transmitted as quotations in the geographical dictionary of Yaqut (under the headings Atil, Bashgird, Bulghār, Khazar, Khwārizm, Rūs), published in 1823 by Christian Martin Frähn.

Only in 1923 was a manuscript discovered by Zeki Velidi Togan in the Astane Quds Museum, Mashhad, Iran. The manuscript, Razawi Library MS 5229, dates from the 13th century (7th century Hijra) and consists of 420 pages (210 folia). Besides other geographical treatises, it contains a fuller version of Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s text (pp. 390–420). Additional passages not preserved in MS 5229 are quoted in the work of the 16th century geographer Amin Razi called &quot;Haft Iqlīm&quot; (&quot;Seven Climes&quot;).

Neither source seems to record Ibn Fadlān&#x27;s complete report. Yāqūt offers excerpts and several times claims that Ibn Fadlān also recounted his return to Bagdad, but does not quote such material. Meanwhile, the text in Razawi Library MS 5229 breaks off part way through describing the Khazars.

===Account of the Volga Bulgars===
One noteworthy aspect of the Volga Bulgars that Ibn Fadlan focused on was their religion and the institution of Islam in these territories. The Bulgar king had invited religious instruction as a gesture of homage to the Abbasids in exchange for financial and military support, and Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s mission as a &quot;faqih&quot; was one of proselytization as well as diplomacy.

For example, Ibn Fadlan details in his encounter that the Volga Bulgar Khan commits an error in his prayer exhortations by repeating the prayer twice. One scholar calls it an &quot;illuminating episode&quot; in the text where Ibn Fadlan expresses his great anger and disgust over the fact that the Khan and the Volga Bulgars in general are practicing some form of imperfect and doctrinally unsound Islam. In general, Ibn Fadlan recognized and judged the peoples of central Eurasia he encountered by the possession and practice of Islam, along with their efforts put forth to utilize, implement, and foster Islamic faith and social practice in their respective society. Consequently, many of the peoples and societies to Ibn Fadlan were &quot;like asses gone astray. They have no religious bonds with God, nor do they have recourse to reason&quot;.

===Account of the Rus&#x27;===

A substantial portion of Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s account is dedicated to the description of a people he called the &quot;Rūs&quot; () or &quot;Rūsiyyah&quot;. Though the identification of the people Ibn Fadlan describes is uncertain, they are generally assumed to be Volga Vikings; the traders were likely of Scandinavian origin while their crews also included Finns, Slavs, and others. The Rūs appear as traders who set up shop on the river banks nearby the Bolğar camp. They are described as having bodies tall as (date) palm trees, with blond hair and ruddy skin. Each is tattooed from &quot;the tips of his toes to his neck&quot; with dark blue or dark green &quot;designs&quot; and all men are armed with an axe, sword, and long knife.

Ibn Fadlan describes the Rus as perfect physical specimens and the hygiene of the &quot;Rūsiyyah&quot; as disgusting and shameless, especially regarding to sex (which they perform openly even in groups), and considers them vulgar and unsophisticated. In that, his account contrasts with that of the traveler Ibn Rustah, whose impressions of the Rus were more favorable, although it has been attributed to a possibly intentional mistranslation with the original texts being more in line with Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s narrative. He also describes in great detail the funeral of one of their chieftains (a ship burial involving human sacrifice). Some scholars believe that it took place in the modern Balymer complex.

==Appearances in popular culture==
Ahmad Ibn Fadlān is a major character in Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, which draws heavily on Ibn Fadlān&#x27;s writings in its opening passages. In the 1999 film adaptation of the novel, &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, Ibn Fadlān is played by Antonio Banderas.

Ibn Fadlān&#x27;s journey is also the subject of the 2007 Syrian TV series &quot;Saqf al-Alam&quot;.

Samirah &quot;Sam&quot; al-Abbas, a main character from &quot;Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard&quot;, as well as her betrothed, Amir Fadlan, are said to be descendants of Ahmad ibn Fadlan.

In the 2003 anime &quot;Planetes&quot;, the body of an astronaut named Ibn Fadlan was buried in a metal coffin by being sent to the depths of space. However, although he says that he belongs to space, he somehow returned to his world environment and was perceived as space debris. Like Ibn Fadlan as a real-life voyager, the retired astronaut says something important.

<doc id="89822" wikidata="Q1500277" url="?curid=89822" title="Pez">
<text>Pez (, ; stylised as PEZ) is the brand name of an Austrian candy and associated manual candy dispensers. The candy is a pressed, dry, straight-edged, curved-corner block 15 mm ( inch) long, 8 mm ( inch) wide and 5 mm ( inch) high, with each Pez dispenser holding 12 candy pieces.

Pez was invented in Austria and later exported worldwide. The all-uppercase spelling of the logo echoes the trademark&#x27;s style on the packaging and the dispensers, with the logo drawn in perspective and giving the appearance that the letters are built out of 44 brick-like Pez mints (14 bricks in the &quot;P&quot; and 15 in each of the &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;).

Despite the widespread recognition and popularity of the Pez dispenser, the company considers itself to be primarily a candy company, stating that &quot;[t]oday, billions of PEZ candies are consumed annually in the U.S.A. alone&quot;. Pez dispensers are a part of popular culture in many nations, an example being &quot;Soul Candy&quot; in the Japanese manga series &quot;Bleach&quot;. Because of the large number of dispenser designs over the years, they are collected by many.

==History==
PEZ was first marketed as a compressed peppermint sweet in Vienna, Austria, in 1927 by Eduard Haas III. The name PEZ is an abbreviation of (German for peppermint). The original product was a round peppermint lozenge called PEZ drops. Over time, a new manufacturing process evolved and the hard pressed brick shape known today was created. The product packaging evolved from wrapped rolls to a small tin to hold the mints, similar to the modern Altoids tins. The first PEZ mint dispensers, known as &quot;regulars&quot;, were similar in shape to a cigarette lighter and dispensed an adult breath mint marketed as an alternative to tobacco. They were invented by Oscar Uxa. Haas Food Manufacturing Corporation of Vienna was the first to sell PEZ products.

World War II slowed marketing and production. In 1945, manufacturers devised and promoted the Pez Box Regular. In 1949 the first dispenser was officially introduced at the Vienna Trade Fair. In 1952 Eduard Haas introduced his product to the United States, and Curtis Allina headed Pez&#x27;s US business. In 1955, the Pez company placed heads on the dispensers and marketed them for children. Santa Claus, Popeye, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck were among the first character dispensers. Since 1950, over 1500 Pez dispensers, including the original character dispensers, have been created.

Pez vending machines were used in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The first German machines were introduced around 1954 and were produced by DWM () and GWS (), both of Berlin, Germany. Machines were later introduced in Switzerland and then in Austria, in October 1956; these were produced by Glerios / R.Seipel &amp; Co. and Theodor Braun (Vienna).

In 1973, Pez built a factory in Orange, Connecticut, US. In 1983, Scott McWhinnie became the president of the Pez company. He retired in 2003. Joe Vittoria became president of the company in 2004. Around 2005 the size of the original factory was doubled and the Pez dispenser line was expanded. In the mid-1990s the peppermint flavor was reintroduced with remakes of the &quot;regulars&quot;.

In early 2002 the family of the original founder of the company bought back 32.5% of the stock from investment company PGH for €18M. They now own 67.5% of the company. The headquarters are in Traun, Austria. The Pez mints are produced in Jánossomorja, Hungary and Orange, Connecticut, while the dispensers are produced in Hungary and China. In 2011, a PEZ Visitor Center was opened in Orange, with over 4,000 square feet dedicated to all things PEZ.

==Patents==
Pez, Inc. has applied for and received patents related to the Pez dispensers, and usually molds the patent number onto the stem of the design. The patent number cannot be reliably used to determine how old a dispenser is. Collectors refer to the first two digits of a patent number as a shorthand for a given patent number. For example, the 5.9 (5,984,285) patent was granted in 1999, but did not first appear on a Pez item until 2002. By 2007, 4.9 patented items were still regularly appearing on store shelves. Dispensers can also be found with several non-US patents, such as the German &quot;DBP 818.829&quot; (Deutsches Bundes-Patent) and the Mexican &quot;Patent Nr 141,242&quot;.

==Injection mold codes==
Pez dispenser stems will usually also be embossed with several injection mold codes (IMCs). Some, like those found on the bottom of the dispenser feet, will tell which mold position the specific piece came from. One found on the side of the stem indicates the country of origin.

The IMC code 4 is followed by a superscripted second number which identifies the specific facility in Austria.

==Characters==

Early Pez dispensers did not have character heads on them. They were what is known now as &quot;regulars&quot;. A regular dispenser is just a rectangular box with a contoured flip top for dispensing the candy. Toy character head dispensers were introduced in 1955, after the candy was introduced in the United States. There are over 550 unique dispenser heads with thousands of variations.

In the 1970s, three historical figures were created: Betsy Ross, Daniel Boone, and Paul Revere, which were released as part of the series. These dispenser heads were not made to actually look like the people they represented, but instead used generic faces with different accessories.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; Pez dispensers have been amongst the most popular collectibles since they were introduced in the 1990s.

The company initially had a general rule against creating likenesses of real people, but in 2006 a limited-edition series of three Pez dispensers were made with likenesses of members of the Teutul family from Orange County Choppers.

The NASCAR-themed dispensers are based on the helmets of famous drivers, rather than their actual resemblance.

=== List of Pez sets of popular characters ===

===Value of Pez dispensers===
Some Pez dispensers can sell for large amounts as collectibles. The highest verifiable sale of a Pez dispenser was a private sale of a Mickey Mouse softhead at $7,000 between an Austrian dealer and a US collector. This dispenser was never available for sale to the public, and was a factory prototype. The most valuable Pez dispensers are three Political Donkeys, each valued at over $13,000, one of which was owned by John F. Kennedy.

===Pez conventions and gatherings===
The Pez collecting hobby has grown to the point where several conventions are held annually around the world. The oldest convention is Pez-a-Mania, which has been held in Cleveland, Ohio, since 1991.

==Media==
Envision Media Arts are developing an animated film version of Pez with Cameron Fay writing a screenplay, Lee Nelson and David Buelow producing, and Gregg Rossen, Catherine Judit Kaehne, Brian Sawyer and Jonathan Hung executive producing the film.

The &quot;Pez Card Game&quot; is an out-of-print multiplayer collectible card game based on Pez candy. The object of the game is to earn 25 points through playing cards with Pez flavours and dispensers. The core set contained 204 cards.

In 2022 a documentary called &quot;The Pez Outlaw&quot; told the story of a rural farmer who made money smuggling foreign Pez dispensers into the United States. The film streamed on Netflix in 2023.
