Saline County was formerly strongly Democratic, voting Republican only four times between 1900 and 1968. From 1972 to 2008, it was considered a swing county in presidential elections, supporting the national winner in every election except 1988 and consistently voting similarly to the national popular vote. However, in 2016, the county swung to the right, and since that election has weighed in as more than 20 percentage points more Republican than the nation.

<text>Richardson County is the easternmost county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,871. Its county seat is Falls City.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Richardson County is represented by the prefix 19 (it had the nineteenth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

Parts of the Ioway Reservation and the Sac and Fox Reservation are located in the southeast corner of the county between Falls City, Rulo (Nebraska), and Hiawatha (Kansas). The incorporated village of Preston, Nebraska is located inside the latter reservation.

==History==
The Nebraska Territory, including this county, was opened for settlement through the Kansas–Nebraska Act on May 30, 1854. Richardson County was created that same year and reorganized in 1855 by the first territorial legislature. It was named after William A. Richardson, a US Representative from the state of Illinois who had sponsored the Kansas-Nebraska Act; subsequently, in 1858, Richardson was appointed governor of the Nebraska Territory.

The first courthouse was built in 1863. The second courthouse was built in 1873 and burned on May 7, 1919.

On May 30, 1879, the &quot;Irving, Kansas Tornado&quot; passed through Richardson County. This tornado measured F4 on the Fujita scale, and had a damage path wide and long. Eighteen people were killed and sixty were injured in this tornado.

In the summer of 1966, Braniff Airlines Flight 250 crashed near Falls City due to bad weather, killing all 42 on board. The BAC One-Eleven aircraft was on the Kansas City to Omaha leg of a multi-stop flight from New Orleans to Minneapolis on Saturday night, August 6, 1966.

Nuckolls was also a notorious slaveowner who was followed by national news in 1860 when he tracked down an enslaved person he owned, named Eliza Grayson. She had escaped from him via the Underground Railroad two years earlier. With the help of a professional kidnapper they attempted to remove the woman from Chicago, where she was found, only to be arrested by local law enforcement. Nuckolls and the enslaved woman were put in the Chicago jail, only for an abolitionist mob to free her and shuttle her away to Canada. Nuckolls went on to prominence and admiration in Nebraska after sympathizing with the Confederate states during the civil war.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva, Kansas (3 miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. At some point, the rails were removed from Neva, KS to Lost Springs, KS, but the right-of-way has not been abandoned. As of 2020, the BNSF Line from Superior, NE to Lost Springs, KS was active and carrying rail traffic to and from Superior. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot; but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad, renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

<text>Nemaha County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 7,074. Its county seat is Auburn.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Nemaha County is represented by the prefix 44 as it had the forty-fourth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922.

==History==
The county forms the core of the Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation formed in the Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1830 as land for the offspring of traders and Native Americans. The grounds of modern Indian Cave State Park mark where the county&#x27;s first community, Saint Deroin, was founded in 1853 by members of the reservation as a trading post on the Missouri River. When white settlement was permitted in the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, this area was part of Forney County (named for US cabinet member John W. Forney) which stretched along the Little Nemaha River from the Missouri River to west of Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1855 Nemaha County was formally founded with Brownville as its county seat. Johnson County, also founded in 1855, was initially administratively attached to Nemaha, but was organized as a stand-alone county in 1857.

Brownville was the biggest city in Nebraska at the time and several firsts occurred in the county including: in 1861 the first state normal school was founded at what today is Peru State College; Daniel Freeman filed the first claim under the Homestead Act of 1862 for land on January 1, 1863, at the Brownville land office.

The Nebraska State Fair was held in the county at Brownville in 1870–1871.

In 1883 the county seat was moved to Auburn.

In 1974 the Cooper Nuclear Station was commissioned south of Brownville.

==Geography==
Nemaha County lies on the eastern edge of Nebraska. Its east boundary line abuts the west boundary line of the state of Missouri (across the Missouri River). Most of the county&#x27;s eastern border follows the Missouri River bordering Atchison County, Missouri. In the county&#x27;s extreme northeast corner, the border follows the river&#x27;s former course, lying nearly two miles () east of the present-day channel. This de facto enclave is McKissick Island. The Nemaha River flows southeastward through the upper eastern portion of the county, discharging into the Missouri River below the village of Nemaha.

The county&#x27;s terrain consists of low rolling hills, sloping eastward to the Missouri River valley. Much of the terrain is devoted to agriculture. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

<text>Nance County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,380. Its county seat is Fullerton.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Nance County is represented by the prefix 58 (it had the fifty-eighth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
The land that comprises Nance County was originally part of the Pawnee Reservation, created in 1857 when the Pawnee Indians signed a treaty with the United States ceding its lands in exchange for the reservation. After Nebraska gained statehood in March 1867, the state government extinguished the tribe&#x27;s rights to their land, sold the land and used the proceeds to defray expenses to obtain lands elsewhere for the Indians. In the mid-1870s the remainder of the reservation was sold, and in 1876 the tribe was relocated to its present-day location in central Oklahoma. The boundaries for Nance County were approved in 1879. It was named for Governor Albinus Nance.

Nearly all the land in Nance County was purchased by settlers or by investors for resale, instead of the homestead provisions common to most of Nebraska.

==Geography==

The Cedar River flows southeastward to discharge into the Loup River near Fullerton. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.5%) is water.

<text>Morrill County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 4,555. Its county seat is Bridgeport.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Morrill County is represented by the prefix 64 (it had the 64th-largest number of vehicles registered in the state when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
The Battle of Mud Springs and the Battle of Rush Creek between the US Army and Cheyenne, Lakota Sioux, and Arapaho occurred in 1865 within what would become Morrill County.

On November 3, 1908, voters in Cheyenne County passed a measure calling for the division of that county. Accordingly, the Nebraska State Legislature passed an act providing for the division of Cheyenne County, the line of division running east–west, south of the town of Bridgeport. The northern portion so divided was to be called Morrill County. In December of that year, another election determined Bridgeport to be the seat of the new county, and the new county&#x27;s officials were determined. The county was named for Charles Henry Morrill, a president of the Lincoln Land Company.

==Geography==
The terrain of Morrill County consists of low rolling hills. A portion of the area is used for agriculture, including some center pivot irrigation. The North Platte River flows east-southeastward through the south-central part of the county, passing Bridgeport before exiting the county some above the southeast county corner. The county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.4%) are covered by water.

Chimney Rock, a rock formation tall with a spire, lies about south of Bayard, in western Morrill County. The rock was a prominent landmark on the Oregon Trail, and has become a symbol of Nebraska, appearing on the state&#x27;s license plates and on its commemorative quarter.

==Law enforcement==
In 2008 the sheriff&#x27;s office employed four officers and five civilians.

The Humane Society of the United States awarded Sheriff Johyn D. Edens the 2009 Humane Law Enforcement Award for his investigation of mistreatment of 200 mustangs on an animal sanctuary. The owner of the Three Strikes Ranch, Jason Meduna, was sentenced to two consecutive 20-60 month terms, by Judge Leo Dobrovolny at the Morrill County Courthouse.

In the May 13, 2010, Republican primary, Milo Cardenas and Travis Petersen, polled 379 votes each (there being no Democratic candidate), and the decision was due to be made between then by a game of chance such as a coin flip, subject only to a recount. After two recounts, Morrill County Clerk, Kathy Brandt offered the candidates the choice to &quot;either cut a card or have their names pulled out of a hat&quot;, cards were selected and the election board shuffled the deck seven times before spreading the cards on the table for a simultaneous draw. Brandt said &quot;Cardenas and Petersen both drew at the same time. Milo, drew a nine of hearts and Petersen drew a six of spades.&quot; Thus Cardenas went forward to the final ballot, scheduled for November 2010, with no other registered candidates.

==Politics and government==
Morrill County is in Nebraska&#x27;s Nebraska&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. As of 2017, it was represented in the US House of Representatives by Adrian Smith, a member of the Republican Party. As of 2017, the county was part of the state&#x27;s 47th legislative district, and was represented in the Nebraska Legislature by Steve Erdman; Erdman is a member of the Republican Party, though the legislature is officially nonpartisan.

Merrick County was formed in 1858, and was organized in 1864. It was named for Elvira Merrick, the maiden name of the wife of territorial legislator Henry W. DePuy, who introduced the bill that created the county.

When first formed, the county was bounded on the south by the Platte River, and by straight lines on the north, east, and west; enclosing of the Pawnee Reservation, which had been established in 1857. In 1873, the state legislature removed these reservation lands from the county, leaving it with a jagged northern border from which narrow panhandles extended northward from the northeast and northwest corners. In 1897, the Pawnee Reservation became Nance County.

The land is generally given to agriculture, with considerable center pivot irrigation and cattle ranching. The North Platte River and the South Platte River flow eastward from Keith County, joining to form the Platte River east of the city of North Platte in central Lincoln County. The Platte then flows ESE out of the county. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Nebraska by area.

Most of Nebraska&#x27;s 93 counties (the eastern 2/3, including Lincoln County) observe Central Time; the western counties observe Mountain Time. Lincoln County is the westernmost of the Nebraska counties to entirely observe Central Time.

<text>Knox County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 8,391. Its county seat is Center. Knox County was named for Continental and U.S. Army Major General Henry Knox. In the Nebraska license plate system, Knox County is represented by the prefix 12 (it had the 12th-largest number of vehicles registered in the state when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Knox County was organized by the Territorial Legislature in 1857, and named L&#x27;Eau Qui Court, that being the French name for the river named by the Ponca Niobrara—both names meaning, in English, Running Water. The name was changed to Knox by a statute passed February 21, 1873, which took effect April 1, 1873.

==Geography==

Knox County lies along the north line of Nebraska. Its north boundary line abuts the south boundary line of the state of South Dakota. The terrain of the county consists of low rolling hills sloped to the northeast; most of the flat terrain is used for agriculture. The Missouri River flows eastward along the county&#x27;s north boundary line. The Niobrara River enters the county&#x27;s west boundary, flowing eastward then northward to drain into the Missouri River near the village of Niobrara. A smaller drainage, Verdigre Creek, flows northward into the county through the western central part of the county, draining into the Niobrara River shortly upstream of that river&#x27;s mouth. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.8%) is water.

Hooker County voters have been overwhelmingly Republican ever since World War II. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 when the region was decimated by the Dust Bowl, and in no presidential election since 1936 has the Democratic nominee reached thirty percent of the county&#x27;s vote – a record of Republican dominance equalled only by the Unionist Kentucky counties of Jackson and Clinton where no Democrat has passed thirty percent since before 1896. In 1968 Hooker was the nation&#x27;s most Republican county, and it was in the top ten most Republican in 1960, 1976, and 1984.

<doc id="93656" wikidata="Q496086" url="?curid=93656" title="Harlan County, Nebraska">
<text>Harlan County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 3,073. Its county seat is Alma. The county is home to the Harlan County Reservoir.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Harlan County is represented by the prefix 51 (it had the 51st-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Prior to 1870, the portion of the Republican valley that now includes Harlan County was a prized hunting ground for indigenous peoples, and their efforts to keep intruders away deterred white settlement in the area. The defeat of the Sioux at the Battle of Summit Springs in 1869 largely eliminated this threat, and several parties were organized to explore the agricultural possibilities of the area.

A party of forty men from eastern Nebraska settled near the site of present-day Orleans in August 1870. In 1871, a party from the Wyoming Territory, led by Thomas Harlan, settled near present-day Alma, which was named after a settler&#x27;s daughter. In that year, Harlan County was separated from Lincoln County by the Nebraska state legislature. Accounts differ as to the county&#x27;s namesake: either Thomas Harlan, or James Harlan, who was U.S. Secretary of the Interior between 1865 and 1866.

==Geography==
The Republican River flows southeastward across the lower part of Harlan County, being impounded by the Harlan County Lake at the SE corner of the county. The terrain consists of gently rolling low hills, with the majority of flat areas being used for center pivot irrigation.

The county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.

<text>Garden County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 1,874. Its county seat is Oshkosh.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Garden County is represented by the prefix 77 (it had the seventy-seventh-largest number of vehicles registered in the state when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Garden County was formed in 1909 by popular vote. Voters in the general election of November 2, 1909, approved making the northern part of Deuel County into its own county. It is said the county was so named in the hope that this land should become the garden of the West or with allusion to the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;.

The county has lost population since the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The land was homesteaded for family farms that often turned out to be too small for subsistence farming under the arid conditions of the region. In the early decades of settlement by immigrants and migrants from the East, farmers did not know how to work the land on the prairies. Tons of topsoil were lost after droughts.

==Geography==
The North Platte River runs ESE through the south part of Garden County. Since the county is in the western portion of Nebraska, its residents observe Mountain Time. The eastern two-thirds portion of the state observes Central Time.

According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.5%) is water.

<text>Fillmore County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 5,551. Its county seat is Geneva. The county was named for President Millard Fillmore.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Fillmore County is represented by the prefix 34 (it had the thirty-fourth largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Fillmore County was established, and its boundaries defined, by the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1856. It was named for Millard Fillmore, the thirteenth president of the United States, who had left office in 1853.

The first homesteaders arrived in the county in 1866. Ohio natives William O. Bussard and William C. Whitaker filed claims on the West Fork of the Big Blue River in the county&#x27;s northeastern portion. Settlement of the area was slow until 1870; it was concentrated in the county&#x27;s northern part, in part because the surveyed route of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad ran through York County just north of the present-day York-Fillmore county line. In 1870, Fillmore City, the county&#x27;s first town, was established on the Big Blue about north of present-day Grafton; in 1871, the county&#x27;s first post office opened in Fillmore City.

In 1871, the Burlington and Missouri laid its tracks through the area. A recent change in federal law allowed them to alter their route, shifting it about south of their original surveyed path. This placed the route on more level country, reducing the cost of cutting and bridging; it also shifted the line from York County to northern Fillmore County.

The county was formally organized in 1871; up to this time, it had been administered from, and taxed by, Saline County, its neighbor to the east. In April, an election was held to choose officers to organize the county; at this time, it was decided to place the county seat in the county&#x27;s center. The town site was surveyed and platted, and given the name &quot;Henry&quot;. It could not be occupied, since it was on school land owned by the state; an act of the legislature was necessary before the land could be sold.

The legislature passed a bill in the summer of 1872 to allow sale of the school lands. At about that time, the new county seat&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Henry&quot; to &quot;Geneva&quot;, at the suggestion of the daughter of a local settler, who wanted it named after her family&#x27;s old home of Geneva, Illinois.

The county grew rapidly through the first years of the 1870s. Three towns were established along the Burlington line; in keeping with the railroad&#x27;s practice of naming their towns alphabetically, they were dubbed Exeter, Fairmont, and Grafton. By 1873, the entire county had been &quot;thickly settled&quot;. Its growth suffered a check in the mid-1870s, due to the worldwide depression following the Panic of 1873 and an infestation of grasshoppers in the late summer of 1874.

As additional railroad lines were constructed through the county, new towns were established. In about 1886, the Burlington built a branch line from Beatrice to Holdrege, running east–west through southern Fillmore County; Shickley, Strang, and Ohiowa were founded on or near the route. A north–south line connected this branch to the Burlington&#x27;s main line, running from Strang to Fairmont. Milligan was established in 1887, on the Kansas City and Omaha line.

Several ethnic European enclaves developed during the time of the county&#x27;s homesteading. An extensive Czech settlement covered much of Saline County and extended into eastern Fillmore County, including Milligan. A concentration of Swedish immigrants developed in eastern Clay County, extending into southwestern Fillmore County in the area between Shickley and Ong. German settlements formed in both the county&#x27;s southeastern and southwestern corners.

==Geography==
According to the US Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

The county lies within the watershed of the Big Blue River. Water in the county drains via the West Fork of the Big Blue; via Turkey Creek, which runs into the Big Blue near De Witt, Nebraska; and via the Little Blue, which joins the Big Blue in Kansas.

Fillmore County lies within the eastern portion of Nebraska&#x27;s loess plain, a region of soil deposited by the wind between 25,000 and 13,000 years ago, forming a plain that slopes to the southeast. The Big Blue and its tributaries have incised channels into the loess surface in places, but in much of the county the original plain remains. These loess-plain regions are characterized by extensive upland flats with shallow depressions, lined with fine-grained and relatively impermeable silt, and tend to form shallow ephemeral wetlands when filled with rain or snowmelt; such wetlands range in area from less than to more than .

The county&#x27;s surface is underlain by Cretaceous sedimentary bedrock, topped with unconsolidated Quaternary sediments. The bedrock was eroded into hills and valleys before the deposition of the overlying sediments, so the thickness of the latter varies. The unconsolidated sediments range in thickness from ; they form an aquifer whose saturated zone ranges in thickness from .

Douglas County is governed by a board of seven county commissioners, elected to staggered four–year terms. County courthouse positions are also elected on a partisan basis. Most of the county&#x27;s offices are located at the Douglas County Courthouse.


For much of the time after World War II, Douglas County was one of the more conservative urban counties in the United States. It supported the Republican candidate for president in all but one election from 1952 to 2004. However, it has become a far more competitive county in national elections compared to the rest of the state in the last ten years. Barack Obama won a majority of the county&#x27;s votes in 2008, becoming the first Democrat to do so since 1964. He also narrowly carried the 2nd congressional district as well, garnering him one electoral vote statewide. It swung back to the Republican column in 2012 with Mitt Romney winning the county by an even closer majority. The county swung back to Democratic hands in 2016 with Hillary Clinton winning a plurality of its votes, but unlike Obama eight years prior she failed to carry the 2nd congressional district. In 2020, Joe Biden won the county by 11 points, a 56-year high for Democrats, and flipped the 2nd district back into the Democratic column.

As of January 2025, Douglas County is one of the only two counties in Nebraska (alongside Thurston) to have a plurality of registered Democrats.

<text>Dakota County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 21,582. Its county seat is Dakota City.

Dakota County is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Dakota County is represented by the prefix 70 (it had the 70th-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922). In August 2009, the Dakota County Board of Commissioners reversed a decision to abandon this system for alphanumeric plates upon introduction of new license plates in 2011. Douglas, Lancaster, and Sarpy Counties remain the only counties with alphanumeric plates in the state.

==History==
Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived along the Missouri River for millennia. By 1775, the Omaha people had migrated west of the Missouri, where they established a major settlement, &quot;Ton-wa-tonga,&quot; (the Big Village). It had some 1100 residents. From here, the Omaha controlled fur trading on the upper Missouri River with other tribes and with French-Canadian traders, often called &quot;voyageurs&quot;. The Omaha were the first of the Northern Plains tribes to have adopted an equestrian culture.

Dakota County was formed by European-American settlers in 1855. They named it after the Dakota Sioux tribe, who were powerful in the area of Nebraska and South Dakota at the time. By this time, the Omaha were concentrated further south in what became the state of Nebraska.

In 1885, the county went to the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Dakota County v. Glidden&quot; over a dispute with issuing bonds.

As of May 2020, the county had the second-highest per capita COVID-19 infection rate of any American county. About one of every 14 residents has tested positive, mostly at Tyson&#x27;s large meat packing plant in Dakota City. There were 1452 cases reported as of May 11, 2020. This had increased by July 4, 2020, to 1634 cases, and 38 deaths, giving Dakota County the highest per capita death rate to that date.

==Geography==
Dakota County lies on the northeast line of the Nebraska state line. Its northeast boundary line abuts the southwest boundary lines of the states of South Dakota and Iowa, across the Missouri River. The county terrain consists of rolling prairies and bottom lands.

== History ==
Custer County, named in honor of General George Armstrong Custer, was officially organized in 1877, although its settlement commenced earlier. The region was once part of the Sioux territory, but following the Indian Wars, particularly after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the land was opened for homesteading. The first settlers arrived in the early 1870s, inspired by the promise of land through the Homestead Act of 1862. These early pioneers encountered formidable challenges like extreme weather conditions, isolation, and the task of farming in what was considered the Great American Desert. They constructed sod houses due to the absence of timber, and settlements were strategically placed near water sources.

The Burlington Railroad&#x27;s extension through the county in the early 1880s significantly boosted settlement by providing a means for transportation and trade. This led to the establishment of towns like Broken Bow, which was designated as the county seat. The railroad not only facilitated the influx of settlers but also allowed for the export of agricultural products, marking the transition from cattle ranching to more diverse farming practices.

Agriculture shifted from cattle ranching to diversified farming, with wheat and corn becoming prominent crops. By the dawn of the 20th century, he community had established schools, churches, and other civic institutions, marking the transition from a frontier settlement to a more organized community.

Republicans have carried the county by a double-digit margin in every presidential election since, and no Democratic nominee since Harry S. Truman in 1948 has even mustered 40% of the vote. Republicans also hold a massive advantage in voter registration in Cherry County, with 2,947, as opposed to 325 registered Democrats.

<text>Chase County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 3,893. Its county seat is Imperial.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Chase County is represented by the prefix 72 (it had the 72nd-most vehicles registered in the state when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Chase County was named after Champion S. Chase, who served as mayor of Omaha for seven years and was Nebraska&#x27;s first Attorney General.

Chase County was separated from Hayes County by the Nebraska legislature on February 27, 1873, although the county was not organized until 1886.

It was once said that, excluding ranch owners, their wives, and their cooks, at the time Chase County was organized it was populated entirely by cowboys. Part of the reason for such a statement may have been the fact that at one time Frenchman Creek and its main branch the Stinking Water Creek were used as watering stops for cattle drives that traveled from Texas to the Union Pacific railhead at Ogallala. These trails are known as the Western or Great Western trails.

Chase County sits in the region once referred to as the Great American Desert. However, on the broad, fertile plateau, early settlers quickly discovered that Chase County&#x27;s dark sandy loam soil was excellent for farming.

The railroad came to Chase County in 1892, reaching Wauneta on January 28. It was built by a division of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. This line left the main line near Culbertson and terminated in Imperial.

==Law and government==
Chase County is served by a three-member Board of Commissioners. County officials are directly elected. It is a part of the 44th Legislative District of the Nebraska Legislature.

==Geography==
Chase County is on the west edge of Nebraska. Its west boundary line abuts the east boundary line of the state of Colorado. According to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

Chase County is geographically diverse. The spring-fed Frenchman Creek crosses the county from west to southeast. From Enders to Wauneta the path of the creek exposes limestone outcroppings. North of Wauneta is an area of significant loess deposits, including the typical steep-walled canyons. Rolling Sandhill formations are found in the north-central and southwestern areas of the county.

The Pierre Shale of Upper Cretaceous Age is the underlying structure of the region. At Enders Dam this formation is found at a depth of below the valley floor. The Ogallala Formation of Pliocene Age overlies the Pierre Shale. The Ogallala Formation is composed of fine to coarse sand, some gravel, calcareous silt, silty sands, silts and clays. Various degrees of calcareous cementation occur, resulting in lenses of varying loose unconsolidated to very firm compact materials at irregular intervals. The Ogallala beds lie almost horizontal and structural irregularities, such as faulting, have been observed in the area.

The Ogallala Formation is of vital importance to the county and the surrounding areas. The associated Ogallala Aquifer is the primary source of water for the population and livestock, and an important input into agricultural economy of the county.

<text>Butler County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 8,369. Its county seat is David City. The county was created in 1856 and organized in 1868.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Butler County is represented by the prefix 25 (when the license plate system was established in 1922, it had the 25th-largest number of vehicles registered of all counties in the state).

In 2010, Nebraska&#x27;s center of population was in Butler County, near the village of Rising City.

==Name==
There is some uncertainty about how Butler County got its name. The most credible consensus seems to be that Butler County is named for William Orlando Butler, a U.S. congressman from Kentucky and U.S. Army major general who served during the Mexican–American War. Butler was offered the job of Governor of Nebraska Territory in 1854 by President Franklin Pierce, but he turned it down. Regardless, Butler County was still named in his honor. The earliest references to the county being called &quot;Butler County&quot; are found in the journals of the Nebraska Territorial Legislature from the years 1857 and 1858.

Another common explanation proposed for the naming of Butler County is that it was named for David Butler, the first Governor of the State of Nebraska. However, Butler County was created by an act of the Nebraska Territorial Legislature on June 26, 1856, and was referred to as &quot;Butler County&quot; more than ten years before David Butler became Governor of Nebraska and two years before he had even moved to Nebraska from Indiana in 1859. When David Butler came to Nebraska, he settled in Pawnee County, not in the Butler County area. Confusingly, however, the name for the county seat of Butler County, David City, is also sometimes attributed to David Butler, but there are also conflicting sources concerning its origin. A second alternate explanation for the origin of Butler County&#x27;s name is given in Andreas&#x27; &quot;History of Nebraska&quot;. It seems to indicate that the county might have been named for William Butler, an early settler who moved to the area in 1860 and became county sheriff in 1868. However, as noted before, the county had been in existence and had been referred to as &quot;Butler County&quot; well before that point in time.

<text>Box Butte County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 10,842. Its county seat is Alliance. The county was formed in 1886; it took its name from a large box-shaped butte north of Alliance. In the Nebraska license plate system, Box Butte County is represented by the prefix 65 (it had the sixty–fifth largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Box Butte County was formed as part of a series of partitionings of the Nebraska Panhandle. In 1883, the Nebraska legislature divided the Panhandle into two counties, Sioux and Cheyenne. In 1885 the original Sioux County was divided into three counties: Sioux, Dawes, and Sheridan. Because of the distance to the county seat of Chadron, residents of southern Dawes County asked that it be split off; in 1886, the legislature created Box Butte County. The new county was named after a butte in the northern part of the county; before the county&#x27;s formation, its name had been used in advertisements by railroad companies seeking to entice settlers to the area.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Box Butte County is represented by the prefix 65 (it had the 65th-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

== History ==
Boone County, Nebraska, was created on March 1, 1871, and named in honor of frontiersman Daniel Boone. The settlement of Boone County began with the arrival of explorers and settlers in the late 1860s. One of the first white settlers was S.D. Avery, who in 1871 established a claim near what would become the town of Albion. The initial settlement was encouraged by the expansion of railroads and the availability of land under the Homestead Act of 1862.

The community of Albion was platted in 1872 and became the county seat after a contest with the town of Boone. This rivalry for the county seat was common in many frontier counties, reflecting the ambition and growth aspirations of the nascent communities. Agriculture quickly became the backbone of the local economy, with wheat, corn, and later oats being predominant.

The development of Boone County was relatively rapid thanks to its fertile soil and the dedication of its settlers. The railroad, reaching Albion in the early 1880s, played a crucial role in the county&#x27;s growth, providing access to markets for agricultural products and bringing in more settlers. The county&#x27;s population and infrastructure expanded, with schools, churches, and businesses being established to support the burgeoning agricultural community.

== History ==
Blaine County, named after James G. Blaine, a prominent American politician, was established on March 23, 1885. The settlement of Blaine County , like the rest of the Sandhills region, began later than many other Nebraska counties due to its less accessible and perceived less fertile location than other parts of Nebraska. Not until the passage of the Kinkaid Act in 1904, which allowed homesteaders to claim 640 acres instead of the usual 160 under the Homestead Act, did significant settlement in the county occur.

The first settlements in Blaine County were primarily for ranching rather than farming. The town of Brewster, established in 1884, became the county seat. Ranching, particularly cattle, became the economic mainstay, as the sandy soil was better suited for grazing than for crop cultivation. The settlers adapted to the environment by focusing on livestock, with cattle drives and the eventual development of cattle breeding being central to the county&#x27;s economy.

<text>Banner County is a county in the western part of the U.S. state of Nebraska in the Great Plains region of the United States. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was 674. Its county seat is the unincorporated community of Harrisburg; there are no incorporated municipalities within the county. Banner County is part of the Scottsbluff, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Banner County is represented by the prefix 85 (it had the eighty-fifth largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
When Nebraska became a state in 1867, a single county encompassed the entire Panhandle. In 1870, the Panhandle&#x27;s southern half was organized as Cheyenne County. The arrival of increasing numbers of settlers led to the partitioning of the county in 1888: the eastern third became Deuel County; the middle third became present-day Cheyenne County; and the western third became Kimball, Scotts Bluff, and Banner Counties.
The last of these was named by citizens who declared it would become the state&#x27;s &quot;banner county&quot;, and &quot;the brightest star in the constellation of Nebraska counties&quot;.

Upon the county&#x27;s organization, the settlement of Ashford was chosen as the temporary county seat. Four communities aspired to be chosen as the permanent county seat: Ashford, Harrisburg, Freeport, and Banner. Two special elections proved necessary before Harrisburg was chosen.

The initial settlement of the area was by cattle ranchers, drawn by good pastures in the Pumpkin Creek valley. In the late 1880s, these open-range ranchers were displaced by an influx of settlers; by 1890, almost every quarter-section (160 acres, or 65 ha) was claimed by homesteaders. However, the good moisture years that had attracted these settlers were followed by a severe drought in 1893 and 1894, which drove many of the new settlers away; the number of farms in the county declined by more than half, from 565 in 1890 to 226 in 1900. The land thus vacated was again used by ranchers, who raised both crops and cattle. The 1904 passage of the Kinkaid Act, which allowed homesteaders to claim brought a new wave of settlers; however, even these larger tracts were often insufficient to support a family, and many of the Kinkaid claims were eventually sold to established cattle ranchers.

The county&#x27;s growth was hindered by the absence of railroads: the nearest lines ran through Kimball, to the south, and Gering, to the north. Roads were also slow to develop in the county: in 1921, only dirt roads existed. The difficulty of reaching markets tended to discourage commercial crop farming in the county.
===Irrigation===
Rainfall in Banner County is light and variable; the average yearly precipitation at the Harrisburg weather station is .
Farmers responded by resorting to irrigation. The first irrigation well was drilled by the late 1920s, and others quickly followed. By the late 20th century, center-pivot irrigation systems were in use through much of the county. 
By 2000, the Pumpkin Creek basin had approximately 500 registered irrigation wells.
Groundwater pumping combined with drought conditions ended surface flow in Pumpkin Creek by 1993, and significantly reduced the valley&#x27;s groundwater levels. In 2001, the North Platte Natural Resources District, which regulates water use in the watershed, declared a moratorium on the drilling of new wells, and limited existing operations to of irrigation water per year. Complicating matters, lawsuits were filed contending water use in the Pumpkin Creek valley depleted flows into Lake McConaughy and interfered with the prior water rights of downstream irrigators.

===ICBMs===

Beginning in the early 1960s, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), based at Warren Air Force Base near Cheyenne, Wyoming, were installed in western Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. From 1960 to 1963, 90 Atlas sites were constructed in Nebraska. Construction of the launch sites, and upgrading of the roads leading to them, led to an economic boom in western Nebraska. Beginning in 1963, the Atlas series was replaced by Minuteman missiles, which used solid instead of liquid fuel, and which were launched from underground silos. In the 1970s, there were 82 Minuteman III sites in the Panhandle, of which 20 were located in Banner County.

==Geography==

According to the US Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.02%) is water.

Banner County lies on what was once a tableland sloping away from the Rocky Mountains. Over geologic history, it was eroded by Pumpkin Creek and other watercourses, and much of the county now lies below the original High Plains level. The county can be divided into four major geographic divisions: the low-lying and relatively flat valley of Pumpkin Creek, which occupies about 40% of the county&#x27;s area; a tableland, in places smooth and in others deeply dissected, occupying the southern one-third of the county; the Wildcat Hills, a highly dissected escarpment that crosses the county&#x27;s northwestern portion; and a small portion of the North Platte River valley in the county&#x27;s northeastern corner.

* Nebraska Highway 71 – runs north–south, from Kimball to Gering, passing east of Harrisburg.

==Demographics==
Banner County&#x27;s population peaked at 2,435 in 1890 and has since steadily declined. It is one of the least populated counties of Nebraska.

As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 819 people, 311 households, and 237 families in the county. The population density was . There were 375 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 95.85% White, 0.12% Black or African American, 0.24% Native American, 0.12% Asian, 3.05% from other races, and 0.61% from two or more races. 5.62% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 31.2% were of German, 14.4% English, 14.1% American, 8.0% Swedish, 6.8% Irish and 5.0% Norwegian ancestry.

There were 311 households, out of which 30.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 70.10% were married couples living together, 4.20% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.50% were non-families. 19.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.06.

The county population contained 28.80% under the age of 18, 3.70% from 18 to 24, 24.30% from 25 to 44, 27.20% from 45 to 64, and 16.00% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 108.40 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.00 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $31,339, and the median income for a family was $41,538. Males had a median income of $25,250 versus $18,750 for females. The per capita income for the county was $17,149. About 12.30% of families and 13.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.00% of those under age 18 and 11.10% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

About 60% of Banner County is given over to farming: chiefly winter wheat and rangeland,
but also corn, beans, sugar beets, potatoes, sunflowers, rapeseed, and millet.
In response to groundwater depletion and drought, the Natural Resources Conservation Service has developed a system of cash incentives for farmers in the Pumpkin Creek watershed who convert irrigated cropland to dryland farming.

Oil was discovered in Banner County in 1919, but the deposits were too deep to be commercially viable at that time. Petroleum production in Banner County began in 1951, and peaked in 1960, when was produced from 397 wells. By 2009, the number of wells had fallen to about 200; but new discoveries in Weld County, Colorado prompted interest in exploring the Niobrara shale, which lies beneath western Nebraska, northeastern Colorado, and southeastern Wyoming. A 2010 sale of oil leases yielded record prices in Banner and Kimball counties.

==Education==
Banner County is covered by a single school district, with a K–12 school located in Harrisburg. As of 2017, the school&#x27;s enrollment was 151.

==Community==

=== Census-designated place ===

* Harrisburg

It is the only community in Banner County and the county seat; it is one of two unincorporated county seats in Nebraska.

==Politics==
Banner County voters are strongly Republican. In only three presidential elections since 1900 has the county selected the Democratic Party candidate. This has only strengthened in recent years, with Republicans winning over 80% of the vote in each of the past seven elections, dating back to 2000.

<text>Arthur County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 434, making it Nebraska&#x27;s third least populous county and the seventh-least populous county in the United States (behind only Loving County, Texas; Kalawao County, Hawaii; King County, Texas; Kenedy County, Texas; McPherson County, Nebraska; and Blaine County, Nebraska). Its county seat and only incorporated community is Arthur.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Arthur County is represented by the prefix 91 (it had the 91st-largest number of vehicles registered in the state when the license plate system was established in 1922).

Arthur County contains the historic First Arthur County Courthouse and Jail, believed to be the smallest courthouse in the United States.

==History==
Arthur County was established in 1913 from the western part of McPherson County following an effort to move the McPherson County seat from Tryon to the more centrally located Flats: rather than lose the county seat, the residents of Tryon, Nebraska agreed to have the county divided approximately in half, according to boundaries for sandhills counties originally proposed in 1887. The half which became Arthur County had been in the process of settlement by 1884, by ranchers seeking open grazing land. The placement of a post office at Lena in 1894 and the passage of the homesteading act in 1904 (which allowed claims of 640 acres compared to the previous 160 acres in this area) further influenced the county&#x27;s founding and expedited the new county&#x27;s establishment processes.

The new county was named after President Chester A. Arthur, and the village of Arthur, similarly named, was established to serve as the county seat. Principal postal service moved from Lena to the village of Arthur in 1914, which also held the county&#x27;s public schools, general store, bank and co-op, principal churches, newspaper and other businesses and services, all aimed at continuing and facilitating the county&#x27;s rural lifestyle.

The 1920 United States Census counted 1,412 residents in Arthur County, which was then and has remained entirely rural, essentially ranching. Although the village of Arthur underwent electrification in the 1920s, most of the county did not see power or telephone services until 1950–1951. At that time also, highway construction and improvements facilitated transportation, which was especially dependent upon the north-south State Highway 61 and the east-west Highway 92: motor vehicles were the sole means of mechanical transportation throughout Arthur&#x27;s history as it had no railroad or canal. Irrigation of the sandhills land started by 1900 and continued through the first half of the twentieth century, with center-pivot irrigation dominating. The population peaked around 1930 at 1,344 persons, but declined with the Great Depression. By 1950, the county population was down to 803, by 1980 down to 513.

== History ==
Antelope County was officially established on March 1, 1871, and named for the pronghorn antelopes that roamed the region. The first known settler in the area was George St. Clair, known as &quot;Ponca George,&quot; who made a claim in 1868. The county&#x27;s initial settlement was slow due in part to popular views of Great American Desert as unsuitable for farming without significant effort in land reclamation.

The growth of Antelope County was significantly influenced by the construction of railroads through the area. The Sioux City and Nebraska Railroad reached Neligh in 1879, which was then designated as the county seat. This connection to broader markets spurred agricultural development. Wheat, oats, and later corn became staple crops, and the county saw an influx of settlers after the railroad&#x27;s arrival.

<text>Alpha Herculis (α Herculis, abbreviated Alpha Her, α Her), also designated Rasalgethi and 64 Herculis, is a multiple star system in the constellation of Hercules. Appearing as a single point of light to the naked eye, it is resolvable into a number of components through a telescope. It has a combined apparent magnitude of 3.08, although the brightest component is variable in brightness. Based on parallax measurements obtained during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately 360 light-years (110 parsecs) distant from the Sun. It is also close to another bright star Rasalhague in the vicinity.

== System ==

Alpha Herculis is a triple star system. The primary (brightest) of the three stars, designated α1 Herculis or α Herculis A, is a pulsating variable star on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The primary star forms a visual binary pair with a second star, which is itself a spectroscopic binary.

Alpha Herculis also forms the A and B components of a wider system designated WDS J17146+1423, with two additional faint visual companions designated WDS J17146+1423C and D. The two fainter stars are far more distant than the triple system.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;α Herculis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Herculis&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation; &quot;α1&quot; and &quot;α2 Herculis&quot;, those of its two visible components. &quot;64 Herculis&quot; is the system&#x27;s Flamsteed designation. WDS J17146+1423 is the wider system&#x27;s designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog. The designations of Alpha Herculis&#x27; main components as &quot;Alpha Herculis A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the wider system&#x27;s four components as WDS J17146+1423A, B, C and D, together with the spectroscopic pair - &quot;Alpha Herculis Ba&quot; and &quot;Bb&quot; - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

Alpha Herculis bore the traditional name &quot;Rasalgethi&quot; or &quot;Ras Algethi&quot; ( &#x27;Head of the Kneeler&#x27;). &#x27;Head&#x27; comes from the fact that in antiquity Hercules was depicted upside down on maps of the constellation. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Rasalgethi&quot; for the component Alpha Herculis A (α1) on 30 June 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

The term &quot;ra&#x27;s al-jaθiyy&quot; or &quot;Ras al Djathi&quot; appeared in the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium&quot; of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Caput Ingeniculi&quot;.

In Chinese astronomy, Alpha Herculis is called 帝座, Pinyin: Dìzuò, meaning &#x27;Emperor&#x27;s Seat&#x27;. The star is seen as marking itself, and stands alone in the center of the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Seat&quot; asterism, Heavenly Market enclosure (see: Chinese constellations). 帝座 (Dìzuò) was westernized into &quot;Ti Tso&quot; by R.H. Allen, with the same meaning 

== Properties ==

Alpha Herculis A and B are more than 500 AU apart, with an estimated orbital period of approximately 3600 years. A presents as a relatively massive red bright giant, but radial velocity measurements suggest a companion with a period of the order of a decade. B&#x27;s two components are a primary yellow giant star and a secondary, yellow-white dwarf star in a 51.578 day orbit.

Alpha Herculis A is an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, a luminous red giant that has both hydrogen and helium shells around a degenerate carbon-oxygen core. It is the second nearest AGB star to the Sun. Its radius pulsates between 264 and 303 solar radii. At its minimum, the effective temperature is of 
and the luminosity is of 7,200 solar luminosities, while at its maximum the temperature is of and the luminosity is of 9,330 solar luminosities. If Alpha Herculis were at the center of the Solar System its radius would extend past the orbit of Earth at 1.231.4 AU but not quite as far as the orbit of Mars or the asteroid belt. The red giant is estimated to have started its life with about .

The primary has been specified as a standard star for the spectral class M5 Ib-II. Like most type M stars near the end of their lives, Alpha Herculis is experiencing a high degree of stellar mass loss creating a sparse, gaseous envelope that extends at least 930 AU. It is a semiregular variable with complex changes in brightness with periods ranging from a few weeks to many years. The most noticeable variations occur at timescales of 80–140 days and at 1,000 - 3,000 days. The strongest detectable period is 128 days. The full range in brightness is from magnitude 2.7 to 4.0, but it usually varies over a much smaller range of around 0.6 magnitudes.

<text>Victoria Williams (born December 23, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, originally from Shreveport, Louisiana, United States, although she has resided in Southern California throughout her musical career. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the early 1990s, Williams was the catalyst for the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund.

==Biography==
Williams was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1986, she worked with then-husband Peter Case on his debut album, following a year later with her own debut, &quot;Happy Come Home&quot;, produced by Anton Fier, with an accompanying 28 minute documentary by D. A. Pennebaker. In 1990, she released &quot;Swing the Statue&quot;. She also often appeared onstage and on record with the band Giant Sand. In 1993, she acted in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, Van Sant also made the video for &quot;Tarbelly and Featherfoot&quot;.

In early 1992, as Williams&#x27; career was beginning to take off, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Because she did not have health insurance, an array of artists, including Pearl Jam, Lou Reed, Maria McKee, Dave Pirner, and Lucinda Williams, recorded some of Williams&#x27; songs on CD for a benefit project called &quot;Sweet Relief: A Benefit for Victoria Williams&quot;. This led to the creation of the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, a charity that aids professional musicians in need of health care. That year, Williams also released a new album, titled &quot;Loose&quot;. A second album, covering the songs of Vic Chesnutt, was recorded for the Sweet Relief Fund in 1996 under the title &quot;Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation&quot;, and Williams performed a duet with Chesnutt on the album.

Also that year, Williams appeared on &quot;Strong Hand of Love,&quot; a fund-raising tribute album to songwriter Mark Heard, who had died in 1992. That December she participated in a Christmas concert with Jane Siberry, Holly Cole, Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara and Rebecca Jenkins, broadcast over CBC Radio in Canada and National Public Radio in the United States and subsequently released on CD as &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;.

In 1995, Williams released her first live album, &quot;This Moment in Toronto with the Loose Band&quot;. Williams ended the 1990s with an appearance on Jim White&#x27;s &quot;Wrong Eyed Jesus&quot; (1997), a duet with Robert Deeble (&quot;Rock a Bye&quot;) on &quot;Days Like These&quot; (1997), and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Musings of a Creek Dipper&quot;. She followed with &quot;Water to Drink&quot;, in 2000, coproduced with JC Hopkins. She also appeared in the film &quot;Victoria Williams – Happy Come Home&quot;, by D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus.

Williams recorded &quot;Since I&#x27;ve Laid My Burden Down&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Avalon Blues: A Tribute To Mississippi John Hurt&quot; in 2001.
That same year her song &quot;You Are Loved&quot; was included on The Oxford American Southern Music CD #5 .

In 2002, she issued an album of standards recorded during the sessions for her earlier records. &quot;Sings Some Ol&#x27; Songs&quot; includes classics such as &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;Moon River&quot;. That year, Williams was also a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

Throughout her marriage to Jayhawk member Mark Olson, the pair regularly toured and recorded together as The Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, The Creekdippers, and Mark Olson and the Creekdippers, releasing a total of seven albums and one &quot;best of&quot; compilation. &quot;Miss Williams&#x27; Guitar&quot;, a song on the Jayhawks&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot;, was written for her by Olson and bandmate Gary Louris. Olson and Williams divorced in 2006 which also led to the dissolution of their musical partnership.

In 2006, she performed on fellow Creekdipper David Wolfenberger&#x27;s album &quot;Portrait of Narcissus&quot; and even painted the portrait of Wolfenberger featured on the cover. In that same year, she also appeared as a guest vocalist on Modern Folk and Blues Wednesday, the first solo album by Bob Forrest of Thelonious Monster.

Williams also plays in a band called The Thriftstore Allstars, a group of accomplished touring musicians who regularly play in Joshua Tree, California. The Thriftstore Allstars play what their MySpace page calls &quot;loose drunken square dance country gone electric fantasmo&quot;.

In 2006, Williams was ranked No. 89 on &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Living Songwriters. The description stated: &quot;Louisiana-born Victoria Williams&#x27; music paints impressionistic, personal portraits of nature (&quot;Century Plant&quot;), of the spiritual (&quot;Holy Spirit&quot;) and of common folk (&quot;Crazy Mary&quot;). Her songs—as distinctive as her high vibrato—dip heavily into the musical palettes of country, folk, rock, gospel and jazz. Although her debut album, &quot;Happy Come Home&quot; was released in 1987, Williams was largely overlooked until artists like Soul Asylum and Pearl Jam recorded her tunes for the 1993 Sweet Relief tribute/benefit CD, which helped pay medical bills in her battle against multiple sclerosis.&quot;

In 2007, she played numerous shows with M. Ward and is featured on the track &quot;Bottom Dollar&quot; on Christopher Rees&#x27; album &quot;Cautionary Tales&quot; (2007).

In early 2009, Williams commenced the recording of a new album of original material in Tucson with Isobel Campbell as record producer. In May 2009, Williams and Olson reunited with fellow Creekdipper Mike Russell for a one-off performance at an exhibition opening being staged at the True World Gallery in Joshua Tree, California. In July 2009, Williams embarked on a tour of Australia and New Zealand with Vic Chesnutt, but he died of an overdose of muscle relaxants on December 25, 2009. In the fall of 2010, she toured Spain and Switzerland with Simone White and in late 2011 Williams returned to the studio to record another vocal for Robert Deeble for the album Heart Like Feathers which was released in February 2012.

In December 2015, Williams had a seizure, injuring her back and shoulder. Although she was expected to recover fully, the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund was seeking donations to help cover the associated costs, which her medical insurance again would not cover.

<text>In Inuit mythology, Asiaq is a weather goddess (or, more rarely a god) and was quite frequently invoked by the Angakoq for good weather, for instance if spring was late it was important to content her and make sure she would send rain and melt the ice.

In Greenland, she is the mother of weather, who decides the quantity and the time for snow to fall.

Asiaq is also the eponym of &quot;Asiaq Greenland Survey&quot;, a research institute in Nuuk.

<doc id="93717" wikidata="Q5567051" url="?curid=93717" title="Glass Harp (band)">
<text>Glass Harp are a rock band formed in Youngstown, Ohio in 1968 consisting of Phil Keaggy, drummer John Sferra and bassist Daniel Pecchio.

==Early years==
Phil Keaggy was a member of a mid-1960s garage rock band called the Squires; one of their songs, which he co-wrote, appears on the compilation album &quot;Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 9&quot;. In 1967 he moved on to briefly record with the band The New Hudson Exit. At one point, the band had apparently considered Joe Walsh as lead guitarist. Walsh would later establish himself as guitarist for the James Gang before embarking on a solo career and working with Eagles.

In 1968, Keaggy and longtime friend drummer John Sferra, along with bassist Steve Markulin, formed the band Glass Harp. The band gigged in and around the Youngstown, Ohio area, finding work anywhere from school dances to clubs. This incarnation of the band recorded several demos and released the single &quot;Where Did My World Come From?&quot; on the United Audio label in 1969.

Markulin left the group to join his cousin Joe in another successful Youngstown band, The Human Beinz. John Carazino then briefly served as bassist, after which Keaggy and Sferra recruited bass player Daniel Pecchio. Pecchio, formerly of the band The Poppy, was also a flautist, a talent that would later be showcased on a few of Glass Harp&#x27;s songs. Having recorded a new set of demos and signing with new management, the band set out to polish their live act and shop for a recording deal.

==1970–1973==
The band quickly found a following in the thriving music scene of Northeast Ohio, particularly alongside contemporaries such as The James Gang. Glass Harp were especially popular at the legendary JB&#x27;s in Kent, Ohio, playing to packed houses during the volatile days surrounding the anti-war demonstrations at Kent State University.

With their latest demos having found the ears of Grammy Award-winning producer Lewis Merenstein, Glass Harp began work on their first album for the Decca label in the fall of 1970. The eponymous debut album and two subsequent studio albums were recorded in Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios with Merenstein as producer.

Following the release of their 1970 debut album with guest John Cale on viola, Glass Harp soon began getting more high-profile opening spots for some of the biggest bands of the day, such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, Yes, Traffic, Humble Pie, and Grand Funk Railroad, among many others.

Contrary to the tight production and song-oriented nature of their studio albums, the band&#x27;s live shows at the time demonstrated Glass Harp&#x27;s ability to stretch out and expand the boundaries of their compositions. While Glass Harp could be classed among the progressive rock bands of the era, they were in fact one of the pioneers of what would later be known as the jam rock genre, with songs many times reaching over 30 minutes in length with extended solo passages and group improvisation.

By 1971, Glass Harp became one of the most popular (if not one of the highest-paid) groups in Northeast Ohio. This led to both supporting and headlining shows nationally from The Fillmore East to The Winterland Ballroom. On November 21, 1971, the band played an opening spot for The Kinks at New York City&#x27;s prestigious Carnegie Hall, receiving a thunderous ovation at the end of their hour-long set. This performance was released as the &quot;Live At Carnegie Hall&quot; album in 1997.

1972 would be a pivotal year for the group. Having recently released a second album (&quot;Synergy&quot;) Glass Harp were asked to perform a live concert on PBS in February. This broadcast would become groundbreaking in that it was one of the first to be simulcast on both television and the then-nascent FM radio. While an off-air recording of this performance was heavily bootlegged on video for decades, the master tape was later located and subsequently released on DVD as &quot;Circa 72&quot; 2006.

On August 6, 1972 (shortly before their third studio album &quot;It Makes Me Glad&quot; was released) Phil Keaggy played his final show with Glass Harp at My Father&#x27;s Place, Roslyn, New York before embarking on a solo career. Having already written Christian-themed lyrics throughout his time in Glass Harp, Keaggy found an audience in the burgeoning Jesus music scene, and later achieved worldwide fame as both a songwriter and instrumentalist as it evolved into Contemporary Christian Music.

With a tour of East Coast colleges and universities having already been booked for September 1972 in support of &quot;It Makes Me Glad&quot;, Sferra and Pecchio replaced Keaggy with guitarist Tim Burks. In April 1973, violinist Randy Benson (formerly of Tiny Alice) was added to the lineup. The music of the four-piece lineup took on a more progressive edge, similar to King Crimson and The Moody Blues (while studio and live radio broadcast recordings exist from this period, they remain officially unreleased as of 2012). This brief incarnation of the group lasted into October 1973, when they reverted to the trio of Sferra/Pecchio/Burks following Benson&#x27;s departure. Their last known concert before disbanding was on December 2, 1973 at Norwalk High School, Norwalk, Ohio. All three members immediately moved on to other projects. Sferra and Burks formed the short-lived group Hartship in 1974, while Pecchio became a founding member of the popular Michael Stanley Band.

==1981–1997==
In April 1981, Glass Harp reunited when Sferra and Pecchio made surprise appearances at two consecutive Phil Keaggy solo concerts in Ohio (Cleveland&#x27;s Masonic Auditorium on April 10, and Akron&#x27;s Civic Theatre on April 11). Sferra and Pecchio would make a similar appearance at a Keaggy solo concert in Akron in 1986, before an official Glass Harp reunion show occurred at the Akron Civic Theatre on December 27, 1988

In 1993, John Sferra joined Phil Keaggy&#x27;s band on the Crimson and Blue tour. At the tour&#x27;s November 13 stop in Akron, OH (again at the Civic Theatre), Daniel Pecchio again joined with Keaggy/Sferra to perform several Glass Harp songs.

In January 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, opened an exhibit called &quot;My Town.&quot; Because the exhibit focused on Cleveland&#x27;s rock and roll history, Glass Harp were invited to give a special performance and Q&amp;A session at the Museum in April 1997 Currently, Glass Harp is represented in the Museum&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Cleveland Rocks&quot; exhibit.

On May 23–24, 1997, Glass Harp performed two consecutive sold-out concerts at the Civic Theatre in Akron, OH.

==2000–2009==
On October 22, 2000 Glass Harp gave a sold out performance in their hometown of Youngstown, Ohio at Powers Auditorium. Joining the band for the occasion was conductor Isaiah Jackson and members of the Youngstown Symphony Orchestra. The following year saw the commercial release of the reunion concert in the form of the live double album &quot;Strings Attached&quot;. Although the album is largely devoted to the band&#x27;s previous work, it also includes Glass Harp&#x27;s take on several songs from Phil&#x27;s solo career such as &quot;Tender Love,&quot; &quot;Chalice,&quot; &quot;From the Beginning&quot; and a solo acoustic version of &quot;The True Believers.&quot;

In the summer of 2003, the group released &quot;Hourglass&quot;, their first new studio album in 31 years. Well received by fans and critics alike, the album drew on various musical styles that demonstrated Glass Harp&#x27;s many influences and individual talents. In October, Glass Harp made a second appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, again featuring a performance and a Q&amp;A moderated by Rock Hall curator James Henke.

In 2004 the band went on a short U.S. tour in support of their triple-live album &quot;Stark Raving Jams&quot; (a collection of various live instrumental and improvisational material from throughout their career). The album/tour served to successfully re-introduce Glass Harp into the jam band scene, in which they are now considered a pioneering group.

In 2004, guitarists Greg Martin (of the Kentucky Headhunters) and Rick Derringer joined Glass Harp on stage at the Dallas International Guitar Festival. Martin again appeared with Glass Harp at the same festival in 2006.

Glass Harp&#x27;s original Decca studio albums were re-issued on CD in 2005 by Music Mill Entertainment (having first been released on CD in 1993 by Line Records in Germany before quickly going out of print). These releases were remastered with bonus tracks and updated liner notes. As of early 2012, the three Glass Harp titles on Music Mill have gone out of print, and are not yet available for digital purchase.

In 2009, Sferra and Pecchio teamed up with Keaggy, Randy Stonehill and guitarist Mike Pachelli as &quot;The Keaggy-Stonehill Band&quot; and played a few dates in support of Keaggy and Stonehill&#x27;s album &quot;Mystery Highway&quot;.

During the 2000s, Glass Harp&#x27;s touring groups included (at various times) diverse instrumentation such as trumpets, trombones, saxophones, mandolins and violins. Most frequently, the band is joined by keyboardist Chris Queen, formerly of the Athens, Georgia, funk band Mr. Tibbs (a group which also included Ted Pecchio, Daniel Pecchio&#x27;s son, on bass).

==2010–present==
On March 27, 2010, Glass Harp released &quot;Live at the Beachland Ballroom 11.01.08&quot;. The album was more experimental and free-form in nature than previous Glass Harp recordings, and includes extended versions of older material bridged together by the nearly-sixteen-minute &quot;Beachland Jam&quot;. The ten-song project included material from Phil&#x27;s solo career: &quot;Sign Came through a Window&quot; and &quot;John the Revelator.&quot; The album is a recording of a benefit concert that Glass Harp headlined for Roots of American Music (www.rootsofamericanmusic.org), &quot;an organization dedicated to the preservation, performance and education about traditional American music in our schools.&quot;

In March 2011 Glass Harp&#x27;s post-Decca catalog was released on iTunes, and many other streaming/digital services.

On May 7, 2011, guitarist Neil Zaza joined Glass Harp for two songs during their concert at Cleveland&#x27;s Beachland Ballroom.

In March 2012 Keaggy, Sferra and Pecchio performed four concerts in the Eastern U.S. billed as &quot;The Phil Keaggy Band&quot; rather than &quot;Glass Harp&quot;.

Glass Harp remain semi-active , performing one-off headlining shows and short tours. In addition, Daniel Pecchio and John Sferra occasionally appear with Phil Keaggy for an electric set during the guitarist&#x27;s solo performances in or around Ohio. In an August 2012 interview, Keaggy said &quot;Especially this past year I&#x27;ve gotten extra comfortable playing with Glass Harp, we&#x27;ve been lifelong friends. We really love each other as friends and brothers.&quot;

<doc id="93718" wikidata="Q1459594" url="?curid=93718" title="Hugh J. Schonfield">
<text>Hugh Joseph Schonfield (17 May 1901 – 26 January 1988) was a British Bible scholar specialising in the New Testament and the early development of the Christian religion and church. He was born and died in London, and educated there at St Paul&#x27;s School and King&#x27;s College, doing additional studies in the University of Glasgow. He was one of the founders and president of the pacifist organisation Commonwealth of World Citizens &quot;Mondcivitan Republic&quot;.

==Religious and political beliefs==
Born Jewish, Schonfield became a liberal Hebrew Christian who sometimes referred to himself as a Nazarene. In 1937 Schonfield was excluded from membership of the International Hebrew Christian Alliance (IHCA), of which he had been a founding member since 1925, due to his unwillingness to affirm the deity of Jesus. He later associated with Messianic Judaism for a while, but was bitterly disillusioned by the experience. He called himself &quot;the Jewish historian of Christian beginnings&quot;, and at the time of his death he was described in obituaries as a &quot;non-practicing Jew.&quot;

At one time he was president of the H. G. Wells Society. He founded the &quot;Mondcivitan Republic,&quot; Commonwealth of World Citizens, in 1956.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Works==

Schonfield wrote over 40 books including commercially successful books in the fields of history and biography as well as religion. In 1958 his non-ecclesiastical historical translation of the New Testament was published in the UK and the US, titled &quot;The Authentic New Testament&quot;. This aimed to show without idealised interpretation the meaning intended by the writers while maintaining the original structures. A revised version appeared in 1985 titled &quot;The Original New Testament&quot;. In 1965 he published the controversial &quot;The Passover Plot&quot;, a book the thesis of which is that the Crucifixion was part of a larger, conscious attempt by Jesus to fulfill the Messianic expectations rampant in his time, and that the plan went unexpectedly wrong. According to Steve Turner, this was one of the books John Lennon was reading when he commented that the Beatles were &quot;More popular than Jesus&quot;.

Schonfield followed &quot;The Passover Plot&quot; with a sequel in 1968, &quot;Those Incredible Christians&quot;. This was also described as controversial, but had less impact than the earlier book.

An additional aspect of his work was the revision of the Hebrew writing system. In &quot;The New Hebrew Typography&quot;, published in 1932, he argued for a significantly revised version of the Hebrew alphabet modelled after the Latin alphabet, including a capital-lowercase distinction, no final forms, a vertical emphasis, and serifs. This alphabet has not been adopted.

<text>The Alpha Band was an American rock band, formed in July 1976 from the remnants of Bob Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue.

Band members were T-Bone Burnett, Steven Soles, and David Mansfield, plus sidemen who differed from record to record and included: David Kemper (later drummer for Bob Dylan and Jerry Garcia Band); gospel musician Andraé Crouch; and former Beatle Ringo Starr. 

The band produced three albums, particularly notable for their intelligent cultural critique. The members of the band, especially Burnett and Mansfield, are known for their important roles as producers of other people&#x27;s albums subsequently.

<text>The Passover Plot is a 1965 book by British biblical scholar Hugh J. Schonfield, who also published a translation of the New Testament from a Jewish perspective. The book was adapted into a film, &quot;The Passover Plot&quot; (1976).

==Schonfield&#x27;s conclusions==
Based on his research into the social and religious culture in which Jesus was born, lived and died, and into other literature, including the source documents of the Gospels, Schonfield reached the following conclusions:
* That Jesus was a deeply religious Jewish man, probably well-versed in the teachings of the local northern sects such as the Nazarenes and Essenes.
* That growing up in biblical Galilee he had a skeptical and somewhat rebellious relationship to the hierarchy and teachings mandated by the authorities (the Saducees) of the Temple in Jerusalem.
* That Jewish Messianic expectation was extremely high in those times, matched to the despair caused by the Roman occupation of the land and subjugation of the Jews.
* That he was in many ways both typical of his times, and yet extraordinary in his religious convictions and beliefs, in his scholarship of the biblical literature, and in the fervency in which he lived his religion out in his daily life.
* That he was convinced of his role as the expected Messiah based on the authority of his having been descended from King David (the royal bloodline of David), and that he consciously and methodically, to the point of being calculating, attempted to fulfill that role, being eminently well-versed in the details of what that role entailed.
* That he was convinced of the importance of his fulfilling the role perfectly (after all prophesy and expectation), and that he could not allow himself to fail, as that would undoubtedly lead to his being declared a false Messiah.
* That he was perfectly aware of the consequences of his actions all along the way, and that he directed his closest supporters, the original twelve Apostles, unknowingly to aid him in his plans.
* That he involved the least possible number of supporters in his plans (&quot;need to know&quot; basis), therefore very few knew of the details of his final plan, and even then only the least amount of information necessary.

The culmination of his plan was to be his death (the crucifixion), his resurrection and his reign as the true kingly and priestly messiah, not in heaven but on earth—the realized king of the Jews.

==Planning==
Schonfield&#x27;s investigation shows that the Gospel of John properly recounts the Passover events, which are inconsistently described in all the other Gospels. His reading of that Gospel convinced him that John&#x27;s account, though probably filtered through an assistant and transcription in John&#x27;s old age, suggests that Jesus had planned everything. Among other things, that he would not be on the cross for more than a few hours before the Sabbath arrived, when it was required by law that crucified Jews be taken down; that one of his supporters, who was on hand, would give him water (to quench his thirst) that was actually laced with a drug to make him unconscious; and that Joseph of Arimathea, a well-connected supporter, would collect him off the cross while still alive (but appearing dead) so that he could be secretly nursed back to health. Schonfield suggests that the plan went awry because of a soldier&#x27;s actions with a spear. Schonfield gives evidence of a high-ranking member of the Sanhedrin who was one of Jesus&#x27; followers, likely the Beloved Disciple who is otherwise obscure, and notes several instances in which knowledge of or access to the Temple was available to one or more of Jesus&#x27; followers. He identifies this follower as John, the source of the Gospel many decades later whilst living in Asia Minor. He suggests that this Apostle, and Joseph of Arimathea, were responsible for events following the Crucifixion, and that it might have been this Apostle (an &#x27;undercover Disciple&#x27;, as it were) who was seen (by those who did not know him) at the Tomb on the morning of the Resurrection.

==Second half of the book==
After first laying out the storyline and outcome of Jesus&#x27; life in the first half of the book, along with supportive arguments, Schonfield devotes the second half of the book to a more detailed explanation of the concepts and arguments used to support his conclusions. Schonfield also discusses how Jesus&#x27; original message and purpose may have become transformed during the century after his death.

==Film based on book==

&quot;The Passover Plot&quot; is the name of a 1976 film which was adapted from the book. The film stars Zalman King as &quot;Yeshua&quot; (Jesus), and the cast includes Harry Andrews, Dan Hedaya, and Donald Pleasence. It was directed by Michael Campus and nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design. Schonfield also featured in the dramatised documentary television series, &quot;Jesus: The Evidence&quot; (1984: LWT for Channel 4).

<text>The World Boxing Organization (WBO) is an organization which sanctions professional boxing bouts. It is recognized by the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF) as one of the four major world championship groups, alongside the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), and International Boxing Federation (IBF). The WBO&#x27;s headquarters are located in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==History==
The WBO started after a group of Puerto Rican and Dominican businessmen broke out of the WBA&#x27;s 1988 annual convention in Isla Margarita, Venezuela over disputes regarding what rules should be applied.

The WBO&#x27;s first president was Ramon Pina Acevedo of the Dominican Republic. Soon after its beginning, the WBO was staging world championship bouts around the globe. Its first championship fight was for its vacant super middleweight title, between Thomas Hearns and James Kinchen; Hearns won by decision. In order to gain respectability, the WBO next elected former world light heavyweight champion José Torres of Ponce, Puerto Rico, as its president. Torres left in 1996, giving way to Puerto Rican lawyer Francisco Valcarcel as president. Valcarcel held the position until October 2024, he then stepped down and this gave way to the election of Puerto Rican attorney Gustavo Olivieri.

While the IBF had awarded recognition to Larry Holmes soon after its inception in 1983 (as they did with several established champions in the lower weight divisions), the WBO sanctioned a fight between two relatively unknown fighters, Francesco Damiani (winner of the super heavyweight silver medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics) and Johnny DuPlooy, to determine the inaugural holder of its own heavyweight title in 1989. All other sanctioning bodies of boxing recognized the then-undefeated Mike Tyson as the undisputed heavyweight champion. Damiani, meanwhile, went on to become the first WBO heavyweight champion. At heavyweight, especially in the United States, the organization initially struggled to gain credibility as a major sanctioning body, with WBO heavyweight champions Michael Moorer, Riddick Bowe, and Henry Akinwande relinquishing the title to pursue other options. Boxing publication &quot;The Ring&quot; also did not recognize the WBO, despite having recognized the IBF after its inception in 1983, five years prior to the WBO.

In the lighter weight divisions, however, long-reigning champions during the 1990s such as Chris Eubank, Dariusz Michalczewski, Johnny Tapia, and Naseem Hamed gave the WBO title increasingly more prestige. The WBO was also made popular by boxers such as Marco Antonio Barrera, Oscar De La Hoya, Nigel Benn, Ronald &quot;Winky&quot; Wright, Joe Calzaghe, and Wladimir Klitschko, all of whom held its title.

On August 23, 1997, WBC minimumweight champion Ricardo López won the WBO minimumweight title by knocking out Puerto Rican fighter Alex Sánchez. After the bout, López told a Mexican newspaper that he wanted to give his newly won championship belt to his father, who is a boxing fan. WBO president Francisco Valcarcel said he viewed that comment as a public resignation and declared the title vacant without holding a hearing or notifying López. The WBO sanctioned a bout between Eric Jamili (10–5–1) and Mickey Cantwell (13–4–1) to fill the vacancy despite protests by López.

In Europe, the WBO was more accepted during its early years than in the U.S., and WBO champions always fared well in unification bouts with WBA, WBC, and IBF champions. For example, WBO light heavyweight champion Michalczewski unified his title with the WBA and IBF titles by defeating Virgil Hill. WBO featherweight champion Naseem Hamed also defeated the reigning WBA, WBC and IBF champions in the same weight class. By 2000, the WBA was giving the same recognition to WBO champions as it did to WBC and IBF champions.

In 2004 the WBC began naming WBO champions on its ranking listings. The IBF did not recognize the WBO in May 2006, but was doing so by February 2007. WBO regulations explicitly recognize the other three sanctioning bodies. For many years, as with the IBF, boxers based in Japan were not permitted to fight for WBO titles. In 2012, the Japan Boxing Commission (JBC) recognized the governing body. In August 2016, the WBO Asia Pacific Championship was recognized by the JBC and the Japan Professional Boxing Association (JPBA).

WBO men&#x27;s championship belts are brown, whereas women&#x27;s championship belts are pink.

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the WBO blocked championship fights involving Russian and Belarusian boxers.

==Super titles==
Since the early 2000s, the WBO has awarded the honorary title of &quot;Super Champion&quot; to certain boxers, in any given weight class, who fulfil a set of distinguished criteria. Boxers who have been named WBO Super Champion include: Anthony Joshua, Wladimir Klitschko, Oleksandr Usyk, Joe Calzaghe, Oscar De La Hoya, Bernard Hopkins, Jermain Taylor, Kelly Pavlik, Saúl Álvarez, Juan Manuel Márquez, Juan Díaz, Naoya Inoue, Manny Pacquiao, Timothy Bradley, Marco Antonio Barrera, Fernando Montiel, Jorge Arce, Omar Narváez, Donnie Nietes, Kosei Tanaka, Iván Calderón, Marco Huck, Sergey Kovalev, Vasyl Lomachenko, and Terence Crawford. There are currently only two female boxers who earned the distinction of &quot;Super Champion&quot;: Amanda Serrano and Claressa Shields.

This title is not an actual world championship in the same vein as the WBA&#x27;s Super titles; it is more akin to a lifetime achievement award. A boxer awarded the status of WBO Super Champion cannot win the title from or lose it to another boxer; recognition as Super Champion can be maintained even if a boxer moves to another weight class.

==Ranking system==
The WBO publishes monthly rankings, with fighters that win regional championships sanctioned by its subsidiaries being given priority. The World Championship Committee exists to name a mandatory challenger, whom the incumbent champion is forced to fight within an arbitrary timeframe, when this term should be extended, when eliminatories are warranted and when a title is stripped. The body is also responsible for determining who the challengers should be in the case of vacancy or the necessity of an interim title. Exception to this rule are those recognized as &quot;Super Champions&quot;, who can directly challenge for the world championship in another division even if they have not fought in it before. There are other superficial differences between the WBO and other bodies, such as the listing of the 140 lb. division as &quot;junior welterweight&quot;, whereas the WBC uses the term &quot;super lightweight&quot;.

Prior to the WBO being recognized as a major sanctioning body, the system displayed vulnerability when deceased boxer Darrin Morris was moved up twice in the super-middleweights in 2001. In addition, Morris had only fought once in the three years before his death, beating a fighter with only 17 wins out of 81 fights. Morris was Number 7 at the time of his death and Number 5 when the WBO discovered the error. Valcarcel said, &quot;We obviously missed the fact that Darrin was dead. It is regrettable.&quot; Valcarcel also stated that other boxing sanctioning organizations had made similar errors in the past by continuing to rank another boxer after he was dead. One week after British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; broke the story that one of the three men ranking the boxers, Gordon Volkman, still had not heard that Morris was dead.

==Relationship with other bodies==
Under Valcárcel, the WBO was the only sanctioning body that was absent from a summit held in 2014 where the possibility of a single champion per division was to be discussed. In 2014, he publicly opposed the awarding of half-points within the 10-Point Must System favored by the other three. Individually, Valcárcel has also been critical of the WBC for creating the &quot;Maya Belt&quot; and placing it in play in fights where the WBO title was at stake. Another topic that he commented negatively about was the WBA&#x27;s sanctioning of up to four champions per division. Despite this, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic impact on the sport, the WBO invited the presidents of the other organizations to a reunion of its executive board held in October 2021. The main topic of concern was how to manage the mandatory challengers of unified and undisputed champions, in lieu of the promoters and television/streaming platforms complaining about the logistics of consecutive obligatory defenses. This was the first time that the leaders of the four main organizations met personally, with the idea of sanctioning a single champion per division being discussed.

==In other media==
The series finale of Japanese manga series &quot;Bleach&quot; revolves around the main cast gathering to watch a fight in which a character named Yasutora Sado is involved, having become a professional boxer ten years after the storyline and challenging for the WBO world heavyweight championship. The entity has, on occasion, been involved in other areas of sports entertainment, such as when it allowed René Santiago to defend the North American Boxing Organization minimumweight title in a staged match against Fernando Tonos as part of a professional wrestling card held by the International Wrestling Association (IWA-PR). The WBO World Heavyweight Championship also appears as a minor storyline element in &quot;Creed III&quot;, as one of the belts held by the titular character as undisputed titlist of his division.

<text>Richard Wayne Mullins (October 21, 1955 – September 19, 1997) was an American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter best known for his worship songs &quot;Awesome God&quot; and &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot;. Some of his albums were listed by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; in their ranking of the 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music, including &quot;A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band&quot; (1993) at No. 3, &quot;The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume One&quot; (1991) at No. 7, and &quot;Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth&quot; (1988) at No. 31. His songs have been performed by numerous artists, including Caedmon&#x27;s Call, Five Iron Frenzy, Amy Grant, Carolyn Arends, Jars of Clay, Michael W. Smith, John Tesh, Chris Rice, Rebecca St. James, Hillsong United and Third Day. During the tribute to Rich Mullins&#x27; life at the 1998 GMA Dove Awards, Amy Grant described him as &quot;the uneasy conscience of Christian music.&quot;

Mullins was devoted to the Christian faith and heavily influenced by St. Francis of Assisi. In 1997, he composed a musical called &quot;Canticle of the Plains&quot;, a retelling of the life of St. Francis set in the Old West.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Richard Wayne Mullins was born to John Mullins, a tree farmer, and Neva Mullins, whose ancestors were Quakers. He had two sisters and two brothers. The family called him by his middle name, Wayne, which he went by until college, when his friends called him Richard. Mullins grew up attending Arba Friends Meeting, a church in Lynn, Indiana. The Quaker testimonies of peace and social justice later inspired many of his lyrics. When Mullins was in elementary school, his family moved and started attending Whitewater Christian Church, which he attended until he graduated. Mullins was baptized when he was in the 3rd grade. His great-grandmother taught him to play hymns and sing in four-part harmony when he was very young, and he began to study classical piano with a Quaker teacher while in elementary school. He graduated from Northeastern High School in 1974.

Mullins was inspired when the Beatles first appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964. The event helped Mullins understand the influence of music. He was a fan of the Beatles music, and he was able to identify with John Lennon in particular, despite philosophical differences. In his song &quot;Elijah&quot;, written around the time of Lennon&#x27;s murder, he included the phrase &quot;candlelight in Central Park.&quot; This was a reference to the candlelight vigils held in the wake of the event. The places of the vigils went on to become a permanent memorial to John Lennon.

An important part of Mullins&#x27; early musical experience was being the pianist, songwriter and vocalist for the New Creations Choir in Richmond, Indiana, which was started by Tim and Bonnie Cummings in the early 1970s. The choir toured numerous states in its own bus and even produced an album. New Creations is a church and school for teens, and Mullins was a contributing factor in its beginning.

From 1974 to 1978, Mullins attended Cincinnati Bible College. He worked in a parking garage to help pay for his schooling. During this time, Mullins performed with a college band, and later the band Zion, who released one album, for which he wrote all the songs.

From 1975 to 1978, he was the youth pastor and music director at the United Methodist Church in Erlanger. Mullins was then focusing on his duties in the church, and performed minimally in public. He considered his music a hobby. His views on his music continued this way until 1978, when he took a group of teens from his church to the Ichthus Music Festival in Wilmore, Kentucky. He said that during this trip he witnessed the effect of music on the lives of young people, and decided to start pursuing music full-time.

=== Beginnings as a recording artist ===
Mullins&#x27; start in the Christian music industry occurred in mid-1981 when Amy Grant recorded his song &quot;Sing Your Praise to the Lord.&quot; The decision was made to stop touring as &quot;Zion,&quot; and for Mullins to start his solo career. He moved to Bellsburg, Tennessee, approximately 45 minutes from Nashville, to begin his professional recording career. Mullins got engaged sometime between the late 70s and early 80s, and wrote the song &quot;Doubly Good to You&quot; (recorded by Amy Grant on her album &quot;Straight Ahead&quot;) for his upcoming wedding. However, his fiancée broke off the engagement in 1982. In response to the breakup, Mullins wrote &quot;Damascus Road&quot;.

Years later, Mullins shared thoughts about his relationships and personal life in a radio interview with Rick Tarrant:

In 1987, Mullins spent time teaching conversational English in a South Korean seminary. He then served briefly as a missionary in Thailand, in a town approximately from the Thailand-Chinese border. There he became involved with a ministry teaching trades and providing medical care to Chinese refugees. He wrote the song &quot;The Other Side of the World&quot; about his time in Asia.

=== Kansas and the move to Navajo Nation ===

During the late 1980s, Mullins desired change and formulated a plan to leave Tennessee. He took steps to become a music teacher on a Native American reservation he had visited before. In 1988, Mullins moved from Bellsburg to Wichita, Kansas where, in 1991, he attended Friends University. During this time he lived with his best friend, David &quot;Beaker&quot; Strasser. As part of his degree program, Mullins served as the choir director at West Evangelical Free Church. While in Wichita, he also regularly attended Central Christian Church. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BA) in Music Education from Friends University on May 14, 1995. His 1991 song &quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; included a reference to The Keeper of the Plains, a 44 ft tall sculpture in Wichita.
After graduation, he and Mitch McVicker moved to a Navajo reservation in Tse Bonito, New Mexico to teach music to children. Mullins and McVicker lived in a small hogan on the reservation until Mullins&#x27; death in 1997.

In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited personal reasons for his move. He was asked if he made the move because God had called him to proselytize and convert the Native Americans. To this Mullins responded, &quot;no. I think I just got tired of a White, Evangelical, middle class perspective on God, and I thought I would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos. I&#x27;m teaching music.&quot;

=== Philosophy and philanthropy ===
The profits from his tours and the sale of each album were entrusted to his church elders, who divided it up, paid Mullins the average salary for a laborer in the U.S. for that year, and gave the rest to charity. Mullins was also a major supporter of Compassion International and Compassion USA.

His philosophy can be understood by a quote he gave at a concert shortly before his death. He said,

=== Roman Catholicism===
Mullins&#x27;s interest in the life of Saint Francis of Assisi led to an attraction to Roman Catholicism in his final years. There was no daily Protestant service on his area of the Navajo reservation, so Mullins frequently attended daily Mass. The night before his accident, Mullins spoke to his spiritual director, Fr. Matt McGuinness, on the phone and made arrangements to formally enter the Catholic Church that weekend. He stated &quot;This may sound strange, but I need to receive the Body and Blood of Christ.&quot;

In 1997 Mullins declared,

== Music career ==
Mullins had a distinctive talent both as a performer and a songwriter. His compositions showed distinction in two ways: unusual and sometimes striking instrumentation, and complex lyrics that usually employed elaborate metaphors.

Mullins did most of his composing and performing on piano and acoustic guitar, but he also had a prodigious talent for obscure instruments. He displayed arguably virtuoso skills on the hammered dulcimer (in &quot;Calling out Your Name&quot; and &quot;Creed&quot;), lap dulcimer (in &quot;Who God is Gonna Use&quot; and &quot;Where You Are&quot;), and the Irish tin whistle (in &quot;Boy Like Me/Man Like You&quot; and &quot;The Color Green&quot;).

Mullins formed his first band in 1976 to 77 while attending Cincinnati Bible College. In 1983 Debby Boone recorded Mullins&#x27; &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, for her &quot;Surrender&quot; album. In 1984, the song was also featured in a TV film, &quot;Sins of the Past&quot;.

His musical career formally began with Zion Ministries in the late 1970s, where he wrote music and performed with a band called Zion.
The band released one album in 1981, &quot;Behold the Man&quot;. While working for this ministry, Mullins wrote a song called &quot;Sing Your Praise to the Lord&quot;, which was recorded by singer Amy Grant in 1982 and became an immediate hit on Christian radio.

In 1986, Mullins released his eponymous debut album, followed in 1987 by &quot;Pictures in the Sky&quot;. Neither album sold very well, but the Christian radio hit &quot;Awesome God&quot; on his third album, &quot;Winds of Heaven, Stuff of Earth&quot;, brought his music to a wider audience. The song &quot;Awesome God&quot; was written either at Rock Lake Christian Assembly camp in Michigan, or on the way to a youth conference in Bolivar, Missouri in July 1987. The details of the song’s composition are sketchy. As is often true of the work of touring musicians, a song will incubate for several weeks, months, or even years, before it coheres into something recognizable to the writer. It seems this was the case for “Awesome God” as well.

In the early 1990s, Mullins released a pair of albums entitled &quot;The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume One&quot; and &quot;Volume Two&quot;. These featured a more stripped-back, acoustic feel than his earlier work, with nods to Irish music. &quot;Step By Step&quot;, a song written by his friend Beaker and included on volume one, and incorporated into &quot;Sometimes By Step&quot; with additional lyrics by Mullins on volume two, became an instant hit on Christian radio, and, like &quot;Awesome God&quot;, it became a popular praise chorus. Both during and after Mullins&#x27; college years, Beaker was a substantial influence on Mullins and his music. Beaker co-wrote, performed, and toured with Mullins for several years. The first song they wrote together was &quot;Boy Like Me, Man Like You&quot;, a 1991 hit for Mullins. Mullins wrote his hit song &quot;Let Mercy Lead&quot; for Beaker&#x27;s son Aidan.

In 1993, Mullins assembled a group of Nashville musicians (including Jimmy Abegg, Beaker, Billy Crockett, Phil Madeira, Rick Elias, and Aaron Smith) to form A Ragamuffin Band, whose name was inspired by the Christian book &quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel&quot; by Brennan Manning. The band recorded &quot;A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band&quot;, which was later named the No. 3 best Christian album of all time by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;. &quot;Liturgy&quot; was a concept album that drew its inspiration, in part, from the Catholic liturgy. The Ragamuffins also appeared on Mullins&#x27; 1995 record &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; and his 1998 record &quot;The Jesus Record&quot;. Mark Robertson joined the Ragamuffins as the band&#x27;s bass player for touring and &quot;The Jesus Record&quot;.

In 1997, Mullins teamed up with Beaker and Mitch McVicker to write a musical based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi: &quot;The Canticle of the Plains&quot;. Mullins had great respect for St. Francis, and even formed &quot;The Kid Brothers of St. Frank&quot; in the late 1980s with Beaker.

Shortly before his death, Mullins had been working on his next project, which was to be a concept album based on the life of Jesus Christ and was to be called &quot;Ten Songs About Jesus&quot;. On September 10, 1997, nine days before his death, he made a rough microcassette recording of the album&#x27;s songs in an abandoned church. This tape was released as disc 1 of &quot;The Jesus Record&quot;, which featured new recordings of the songs on disc 2 by the Ragamuffin Band, with guest vocalists Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Ashley Cleveland, and Phil Keaggy. &quot;Heaven in His Eyes&quot; was not a new song, but had been written more than two decades earlier, and was a beloved favorite of Mullins&#x27;.

Mullins recorded the duet &quot;I Believe&quot; with Hokus Pick on the album &quot;Brothers From Different Mothers&quot; in 1994. In addition to vocals, Mullins performed on the lap and hammered dulcimers.

== Death and legacy ==
On September 19, 1997, Mullins and his friend Mitch McVicker were traveling southbound on I-39 north of Bloomington, Illinois, to a benefit concert at Wichita State University in Kansas, when they lost control of their Jeep. Neither occupant was wearing a seat belt, and both were ejected from the vehicle. A semi-trailer truck traveling in the same direction swerved to miss the overturned Jeep and hit Mullins, killing him instantly. McVicker was seriously injured but survived.

Mullins&#x27; funeral was open to the public and attracted a large gathering. He is buried at the Harrison Township cemetery in Hollansburg, Ohio, alongside his brother, who died in infancy, and his parents.

In 1998, the tribute album &quot;Awesome God: A Tribute to Rich Mullins&quot; was released, featuring favorite Mullins songs reinterpreted by his Christian music peers.

Mullins&#x27; family founded The Legacy of a Kid Brother of St. Frank to continue his mission to develop programs of art, drama and music camps for Native American youth and provide a traveling music school serving remote areas of the reservations.

On April 29, 2014, Mullins posthumously was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. His brother, David, was on hand to accept on behalf of the family.

Musicians Andrew Peterson, Matt Maher, and activist Shane Claiborne have cited Mullins as influential. Claiborne listed Rich Mullins on his list of contemporary Christian saints and martyrs deserving a &quot;feast day&quot; of remembrance.
Color Green Films, with Kid Brothers of St. Frank Co., developed a full-length feature film, as well as a documentary, based on Mullins&#x27; life and legacy. The film, &quot;Ragamuffin&quot;, finished filming in October 2012 and premiered in Wichita, Kansas on January 9, 2014.

Singer/songwriter John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats, an indie folk band, mentioned his appreciation for Mullins&#x27; songs during a difficult time in his life.

To honor Mullins&#x27; legacy, InterVarsity Press released the 25th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Rich Mullins: An Arrow Pointing to Heaven&quot; in 2023.

<text>Pawnee mythology is the body of oral history, cosmology, and myths of the Pawnee people concerning their gods and heroes. The Pawnee are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans, formerly located on the Great Plains along tributaries of the Missouri and Platte Rivers in Nebraska and Kansas and currently located in Oklahoma. They historically speak Pawnee, a Caddoan language. The Pawnees lived in villages of earth lodges. They grew corn and went on long bison hunts on the open plains twice a year. The tribe has four bands: the Skidi and &quot;the South Bands&quot; consisted of the Chawi, the Kitkahahki and the Pitahawirata Pawnee.

There were some differences in the mythology of the Skidi and the South Bands. The Skidis were &quot;the great star specialists&quot;, with a belief system focusing on visible objects on the night sky. Stars east of the Milky Way were regarded as male gods, while the female powers reigned in the western sky. The South Bands acknowledged the creative powers of some celestial objects and meteorological phenomena, but largely counted upon animals for support and guidance.

Much of the written literature about Pawnee religion and cosmology was recorded by the anthropologist James Rolfe Murie (Skiri Pawnee), (1862–1921), who was a fluent Pawnee speaker.

==Deities and spirit animals==
Atías Tirawa, which means &quot;Our Father Above&quot; in the Pawnee language (often translated, inaccurately, as &quot;Great Spirit&quot;), was the creator god. Another variant, perhaps most used, is Tirawahat. He was believed to have taught the Pawnee people tattooing, fire-building, hunting, agriculture, speech and clothing, religious rituals (including the use of tobacco and sacred bundles), and sacrifices. He was associated with most natural phenomena, including stars and planets, wind, lightning, rain, and thunder. The wife of Tirawa was Atira, goddess of the Earth. Atira (literally, Mother Corn) was associated with corn.

The male Morning Star in the East was believed to be created first. Being the war god he wore the dress of a warrior. After him came the female Evening Star in the West. She resisted the divine plan to create humankind. Morning Star had to fight and overcome a number of forces in the western sky with his fireball to finally mate with her. The first human being thus created was a girl.

Six major stars represented other gods controlled by Tirawahut. Two of them were the female Southwest and Northwest Stars. The male stars were the North, the Northeast, the Southeast, and the South Stars. Some had specific tasks to fulfill:
*The North Star was the son of South Star. He watched over the people and had to keep his post.
*Northeast Star (or Big Black Meteoric Star) controlled the animals, in particular the bison. He was also in charge of the shift from day to night. According to some Skidis, this unidentified and enigmatic star was a buffalo bull carrying the heaven on his back. The mythology of the South Bands does not mention this god at all and only a number of the other star gods.
*Southeast Star (or Red Star) regulated the coming of day and had authority among the animals.
*South Star rose sometimes on the heaven to see if his son (North Star) remained on his fixed position. South Star ruled in the land of the dead. He received no prayers and no ceremony was held in his name. Paths in the Milky Way guided the dead human beings to his dominion.

The Thunder, the Lightning, the Cloud and the Wind were four great powers in the west. They obeyed the Evening Star. By means of constant song they generated the Earth on which the first girl (the child of Evening and Morning Stars) was placed.

The solar and lunar deities were Shakuru and Pah, respectively. They were the last of all gods placed in the heavens. Their offspring was a boy, and he was put on Earth, too. Aside from this, the Sun and the Moon are of relatively minor standing in the Skidi Pawnee mythology.

Meteorites brought good fortune to the finders. They were seen as the children of Tirawahut sent down to Earth.

While the Skidi Pawnee relied a great deal on the powers and the aid of stars and other objects in cosmos, the South Bands came through foremost by the assistance and advice of a number of animals. Yet, the gods in heaven existed, and the animals acted as go-betweens when they instructed and guided the South Bands.

The White Beaver ceremony of the Chawi served nearly the same purpose as the renewing or restarting Spring Awakening ceremony (Thunder ceremony) of the Skidi. However hibernating animals were revitalized through this rite rather than the renewal of corn crops.

Tirawa conferred miraculous powers on certain animals. These spirit animals, the &quot;nahurac&quot;, would act as Tirawa&#x27;s messengers and servants, and could intercede with him on behalf of the Pawnee. The nahurac had five dwellings or lodges:
* The foremost among them was Pahuk, usually translated &quot;hill island&quot;, a bluff on the south side of the Platte River, near the town of Cedar Bluffs in present-day Saunders County, Nebraska.
*Lalawakohtito, or &quot;dark island&quot;, was an island in the Platte near Central City, Nebraska.
*Ahkawitakol, or &quot;white bank&quot;, was on the Loup River opposite the mouth of the Cedar River in what is now Nance County, Nebraska.
*Kitzawitzuk, translated &quot;water on a bank&quot;, also known to the Pawnee as Pahowa, was a spring on the Solomon River near Glen Elder, Kansas. It now lies beneath the waters of Waconda Reservoir.
*The fifth lodge of the nahurac was known to the Pawnee as Pahur (/pa&#x27;hur/, translated as &quot;hill that points the way&quot; or &quot;guide rock&quot;).

==Celestial observation==
The Pawnee seasonal rituals were tied to the observation of the stars and planets. Their earthwork lodges were built at the same time as observatories and as &quot;microcosm&quot; (scale-model of the universe).
Each lodge &quot;was at the same time the universe and also the womb of a woman, and the household activities represented her reproductive powers.&quot; 
The lodge also represented the universe in a more practical way. The physical construction of the house required setting up four posts to represent the four cardinal directions, &quot;aligned almost exactly with the north–south, east–west axis.&quot;
A Pawnee observatory-lodge also required an unobstructed view of the eastern sky. The lodge&#x27;s axis would be oriented east–west in such a way that the sunrise of vernal equinox would cast light on the altar. The dimensions of the lodge&#x27;s smoke hole and door would be designed to allow observation of the sky, e.g. with the smoke-hole aligned to enable observation of the Pleiades.

According to one Skidi-band Pawnee man at the beginning of the twentieth century, &quot;The Skidi were organized by the stars; these powers above made them into families and villages, and taught them how to live and how to perform their ceremonies. The shrines of the four leading villages were given by the four leading stars and represent those stars which guide and rule the people.&quot;

Regular ceremonies were performed before major events, such as semi-annual buffalo hunts. Kawaha, an often-besought god of good luck, was closely connected to buffalo hunts. Many other important activities of the year were started with a ceremony, such as sowing seeds in the spring and harvesting in the fall .

The most important ceremony of the Pawnee culture, the Spring Awakening ceremony, was meant to awaken the earth and ready it for planting. It can be tied to celestial observation, held at the time when the priest first tracked &quot;two small twinkling stars known as the Swimming Ducks in the northeastern horizon near the Milky Way.&quot; and then heard a rolling thunder from the West. (See above for the role of Thunder in the Creation myth).

== Morning Star ceremony ==


The Morning Star ceremony was a religious ceremony occasionally involving a ritual human sacrifice of a young girl, performed only by a single village (Village Across a Hill) of the Skidi band of the Pawnee. It was connected to the Pawnee creation narrative, in which the mating of the male Morning Star with the female Evening Star created the first human being, a girl.
The Skidi Pawnee practiced the Morning Star ritual regularly, although seemingly not annually, through the 1810s. In June 1818, the &quot;Missouri Gazette&quot; reported a sacrifice &quot;some time ago&quot;. The newborn of a captive Comanche woman was sacrificed after the woman herself had managed to escape on a stolen horse. However, two members of the Long Expedition in 1820 believed that the young Pawnee man Petalesharo had rescued the Comanche girl and urged an end to the Morning Star ritual. Edwin James gave the year for this action as 1817, while John R. Bell placed it around 1815.

U.S. Indian agents sought to convince chiefs to suppress the ritual, and major leaders, such as Knife Chief and his relative Petalesharo or Man Chief, worked to change the practices objected to by the increasing number of American settlers on the Plains. An additional aim of the agents could have been to protect the fur trade by reducing intertribal animosity.

The custom came to the wider attention of the public in the Eastern United States in 1820 due to reports of a young Pawnee warrior, Man Chief, who risked his life to rescue a Comanche girl from the sacrificial scaffold in defiance of the Skidi Pawnee priesthood. Indian Agent John Dougherty and some influential Pawnees tried without luck to save the life of a Cheyenne girl before mid-April 1827. The last known sacrifice was of Haxti, a 14-year-old Oglala Lakota girl on April 22, 1838. (A later stated 1833 sacrifice was confused with the one in April 1827).

===The identity of the Morning Star===
The identity of the Morning Star is not clear. &quot;The earliest accounts specified Venus as Morning Star, while most ethnographers favored Mars&quot;, given it was said to be red. Jupiter is also a candidate.

During the known 1827 and 1838 ceremonies, calculations show that Venus rose in the morning sky.

===Human sacrifice===
The ceremony was performed in spring, in years when &quot;Mars was &quot; (see above: The identity of the Morning Star), but usually not as an actual human sacrifice, but merely as a symbolic ceremony. However, one source states, &quot;Several or more years frequently elapsed between occurrences of the Morning Star Ceremony&quot;. An actual human sacrifice would be performed only when a man of the village dreamed that the Morning Star had come to him and told him to perform the proper ceremony. He would then consult with the keeper of the Morning Star bundle, receiving from him a warrior costume. At the first instruction, both the visionary and the priest would cry, knowing that the mission put upon them by the Morning Star was wrong to carry out. The man, aided by volunteers, then had to carry out an attack on an enemy village and capture a girl of suitable age.

Returning to the village, the captured girl would be handed over to the servant (priest) of the Morning Star. The people in contact with the girl treated her with respect, but kept her isolated from the rest of the tribe. When it was time for the spring sacrifice, she was ritually cleansed. A five-day ceremony then began with the priest singing songs describing the advancing stages in the rite, and the girl was symbolically transformed from human to celestial form, as the ritual representation of the Evening Star. On the final day of the ceremony, a procession of men, boys and male infants carried by their mothers accompanied the girl outside the village to a scaffold. The scaffold was made of sacred woods and skins, representing &quot;Evening Star&#x27;s garden in the west, the source of all animal and plant life.&quot;

Anthropologist Ralph Linton reported that evidence indicated the practice &quot;was carried out somewhat unwillingly&quot; by Pawnee religious leaders, who regarded it as an obligation or duty and took no pleasure from the practice. The priests removed her clothing and she was left alone on the scaffold at the moment of the rising of the Morning Star (Mars). Symbolizing the Morning Star and his fireballs, two men would come from the east and touch flaming branches to her armpits and groin. She would then be touched with war clubs by four other men. A sacred arrow from the Skull bundle was shot through her heart by the man who captured her while simultaneously another man struck her over the head with the war club from the Morning Star bundle. The dead girl&#x27;s chest would then be cut open by the priest with a flint knife while her captor caught her blood on dried meat. (&quot;A very small cut is made ... The heart is not exposed or removed.&quot;) All male members of the tribe would then press forward and shoot arrows into the dead body, then circle the scaffold four times and disperse.

By shooting arrows into her body, the village men, as embodiments of Morning Star, were symbolically mating with her. Her blood would drip down from the scaffolding and onto the ground which had been made to represent the Evening Star&#x27;s garden of all plant and animal life. They took her body and laid the girl face down on the prairie, where her blood would enter the earth and fertilize the ground. The spirit of the Evening Star was understood to be released and the ceremony supposedly ensured the success of the crops, the continuation of all life on the Plains, and the perpetuation of the Universe.

<text>Leicester Square ( ) is a pedestrianised square in the West End of London, England, and is the centre of London&#x27;s entertainment district. It was laid out in 1670 as Leicester Fields, which was named after the recently built Leicester House, itself named after Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. The square was originally a gentrified residential area, with tenants including Frederick, Prince of Wales and the artists William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds. It became more down-market in the late 18th century as Leicester House was demolished and retail developments took place, becoming a centre for entertainment. Major theatres were built in the 19th century, which were converted to cinemas towards the middle of the next. Leicester Square is the location of nationally significant cinemas such as the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square and Empire, Leicester Square, which are often used for film premieres. The nearby Prince Charles Cinema is known for its screenings of cult films and marathon film runs. The square remains a tourist attraction which hosts events, including for the Chinese New Year.

The square has always had a park in its centre, which was originally common land. The park&#x27;s fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in the mid-19th century after changing ownership several times. It was restored under the direction of Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 Summer Olympics at a cost of more than £15 million.

==Geography==
The square lies within an area bound by Lisle Street, to the north; Charing Cross Road, to the east; Orange Street, to the south; and Whitcomb Street, to the west. The park at the centre of the square is bound by Cranbourn Street, to the north; Leicester Street, to the east; Irving Street, to the south; and a section of road designated simply as Leicester Square, to the west. It is within the City of Westminster, north of Trafalgar Square, east of Piccadilly Circus, west of Covent Garden, and south of Cambridge Circus.

The nearest London Underground station is , which opened in 1906. London bus routes 24, 29 and 176 run on nearby Charing Cross Road.

Leicester Square has also been used as the name for the immediate surrounding area, roughly corresponding with Coventry Street, Cranbourn Street, Charing Cross Road and St Martin&#x27;s Street. This includes Bear Street, Haymarket, Hobhouse Court (named after Sir John Cam Hobhouse), Hunt&#x27;s Court (after Samuel Hunt, 17th century carpenter and leaseholder), Irving Street (after actor Henry Irving), Orange Street (named after William III, Prince of Orange), Oxendon Street (after Sir Henry Oxenden, 1st Baronet), Panton Street (after local property dealer Thomas Panton), and Trafalgar Square.

==History==

===16th–18th centuries===

The land where Leicester Square now lies once belonged to the Abbot and Convent of Westminster Abbey and the Beaumont family. In 1536, Henry VIII took control of of land around the square, with the remaining being transferred to the king the following year. The square is named after Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, who purchased this land in 1630. By 1635, he had built himself a large house, Leicester House, at the northern end. The area in front of the house was then enclosed, depriving inhabitants of St Martin in the Fields parish of their right to use the previously common land. The parishioners appealed to King Charles I, and he appointed three members of the privy council to arbitrate. Lord Leicester was ordered to keep part of his land (thereafter known as Leicester Fields and later as Leicester Square) open for the parishioners. 

The square was laid out to the south of Leicester House and developed in the 1670s. The area was originally entirely residential, with properties laid out in a similar style to nearby Pall Mall. In 1687, the northern part of the square became part of the new parish of St Anne, Soho. The 7th Earl of Leicester took ownership of the property in 1728 and it was the residence of Frederick, Prince of Wales, from 1742 until his death in 1751 and that of his wife Princess Augusta until 1771. The poet Matthew Prior lived at what is now No. 21 around 1700 and artist William Hogarth resided at No 30 between 1733 and 1764, where he produced some of his best known works including &quot;Gin Lane&quot;. The magistrate Thomas de Veil, later to found Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court, lived at No 40 between 1729 and 1737; this location is now The Londoner hotel and Odeon Luxe West End cinema. The painter Joshua Reynolds lived at No 47 from 1760 until his death in 1792; this location is now Fanum House, once the Automobile Association head office.

At the end of the 17th century, Lord Leicester&#x27;s heir, Philip Sidney, 3rd Earl of Leicester, permitted a small amount of retail development in booths along the front of Leicester House. A statue of George I was built on the square in 1760 following the coronation of his great-grandson, George III. The square remained fashionable throughout most of the 18th century, with notable residents including the architect James Stuart at No 35 from 1766 to 1788 and the painter John Singleton Copley at No. 28 from 1776 to 1783.

Leicester House was intermittently inhabited during the mid-18th century, and was finally sold to the naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the house into a museum with a significant amount of natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels began to appear around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home of a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.

In 1790, a new Royal Opera House was proposed to be built in Leicester Square. The scheme was led by the Prince of Wales, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford and James Cecil, 1st Marquess of Salisbury and aimed to re-establish London as a centre for Italian opera and ballet, with an opera house to rival those in mainland Europe. The opera house was never built, as the royal patent needed at that time to license a theatre was refused. The plans for the original design are preserved in Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, while a 1790 painting by William Hodges, which displays the finished design, belongs to the Museum of London.

===19th–21st centuries===

By the 19th century, Leicester Square was known as an entertainment venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld&#x27;s Great Globe, which was built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street made it easier for traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No. 5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.

Several foreign-owned hotels were established around the square, making it popular with visitors to London. Brunet&#x27;s Hôtel at No. 25 was opened by Louis Brunet in 1800, later expanding to Nos. 24 and 26 during the following decade. It was bought by Francis Jaunay in 1815 known as Jaunay&#x27;s Hôtel. The Hôtel Sablonière et de Provence opened at No. 17–18 in 1845 as the Hôtel de Provence, and renamed in 1869. It closed in 1919 and became a public house. The Cavour, at No. 20 at the southeast of the square, opened in 1864. It was badly damaged in World War II but subsequently restored.
The Alhambra Theatre was built in 1854 on the east side of the square, dominating the site. It temporarily closed two years later when the original owner, Edward Clarke, became bankrupt, but then reopened in 1858 as the Alhambra Palace. It enjoyed a surge in popularity after Queen Victoria and family came to see &quot;Black Eagle – The Horse of Beauty&quot;. It burned down in 1882, but reopened the following year. In the early 20th century, the theatre became a popular venue for ballet. It was demolished in 1936 and replaced by the Odeon Cinema. The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened in 1884 on the former site of Savile House, but had a troubled start, closing for a time, until the end of the decade. The theatre gained a reputation for high-class prostitutes frequenting the theatre, and in 1894 the London County Council ordered the promenade on the upper balcony to be remodelled. A young Winston Churchill, then a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, helped destroy canvas screens that had been erected to prevent access to the balcony. The theatre closed in 1927, to be replaced by the Empire Cinema.

During the Winter of Discontent, where the incumbent Labour Party struggled to meet demands of trade unions and a shrinking economy, refuse collectors went on strike in January 1979. Leicester Square was turned into a &quot;de facto&quot; dump, earning it the nickname of &quot; Square&quot;. In the 1980s, the square was pedestrianised, cutting off all vehicular traffic. Access to the square for goods and deliveries is now controlled by specially designated marshals.

By the start of the 21st century, Westminster City Council were concerned that the square was too dangerous at night, and wanted to demolish sections of it to encourage the growth of theatres and cinemas, and reduce popularity of nightclubs. In 2010, a major redevelopment of Leicester Square took place as part of a Great Outdoors scheme proposed by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The improvements included of granite paving and a water feature surrounding the Shakespeare statue. The square re-opened in May 2012 after 17 months&#x27; work at a total cost of £15.3 million. The Greater London Authority said the refurbishments would accommodate more than 1,000 new jobs. The re-opening coincided with the 2012 Summer Olympics later that year.

==Features==
===Gardens square===

In the middle of the square is a small park that was originally available for common use on Lammas Day (12 August), such as washing clothes and herding cattle. The Earl of Leicester was obliged to preserve these grounds, which were separated from the rest of the square with railings. In 1808, the garden was sold by the Leicester Estate to Charles Elmes for £210 (), who neglected to maintain it. Ownership changed hands a number of times during the first half of the 19th century, including Robert Barren following Elmes&#x27; death in 1822, John Inderwick in 1834, and Hyam Hyams and Edward Moxhay in 1839. Little maintenance was done and the garden deteriorated to the point of severe dilapidation.

In 1848, the land was subject to the significant legal case of &quot;Tulk v Moxhay&quot;. The plot&#x27;s previous owner, Moxhay, had agreed upon a covenant not to erect buildings but the law would not allow buyers who were not &quot;privy&quot; to the initial contract to be bound by subsequent promises. The judge, Lord Cottenham, decided that future owners of land could be bound by promises to abstain from activity, subject to the doctrine of notice (actual or constructive). Otherwise, a buyer could (re-)sell land to himself to undermine an initial promise. James Wyld bought the assets of the garden from the Tulk and Moxhay&#x27;s death estates in 1849 to erect the Great Globe, though buried the statue of George I under 12 feet of earth with the globe stuck on top. The statue was uncovered following the globe&#x27;s demise, but by 1866 it had deteriorated due to vandalism and was sold for £16. Arguments continued about the fate of the garden, with Charles Augustus Tulk&#x27;s heirs erecting a wooden hoarding around the property in 1873. These were quickly removed after the Master of the Rolls ordered that the land must be preserved for its original purpose.
The garden was saved by the Member of Parliament (MP) Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies and is now in the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by William Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by Henry Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by Thomas Woolner; and William Hogarth, the painter, by Joseph Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Sir Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After the Great Outdoors refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.

===Entertainment===
Since the 19th century, Leicester Square has been known for its entertainment venues, including the Alhambra and Empire theatres and the nearby Daly&#x27;s Theatre, which opened in 1893, and the Hippodrome, which opened in 1900. One of the signs marking the square bears the legend &quot;Theatreland&quot;. In the 20th century, most of these large theatres became cinemas and the area is the centre of London&#x27;s cinema scene and the prime location in the United Kingdom for film premieres. Since the 1980s, it has hosted the London Film Festival each year. The Odeon Leicester Square, on the site of the old Alhambra theatre, is the cinema with the most seats in a single screen in the United Kingdom. Similar to Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, the square was surrounded by floor mounted plaques with film stars&#x27; names and cast handprints. During the 2010–2012 refurbishment, many of the plaques were removed, confusing tourists who still expected to find them there. 

In the 1950s, the Hippodrome became a nightclub and is now a casino.
The Leicester Square Theatre is based in nearby Leicester Place. It was constructed in 1955 as a church, before becoming the Notre Dame Hall, then the Cavern in the Town, a popular live music venue in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was renamed back to the Notre Dame Hall, where the Sex Pistols played one of their first gigs at the club on 15 November 1976. It was converted into a theatre in 2002 as The Venue, and refurbished as the Leicester Square Theatre in 2008 (using the name of an earlier cinema). 

The square has been the home for &quot;TKTS&quot; (originally known as the Official London Half-Price Theatre Ticket Booth), since 1980. Tickets for theatre performances taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from the booth at a significant discount. The popularity of the booth has given rise to other booths and stores around the square that advertise half-price tickets for West End shows. The Official London Theatre Guide recommends avoiding these booths as they are not official and do not contain the Society of Ticket Agents &amp; Retailers (STAR) logo.

Global Radio has its headquarters on the east side of Leicester Square at No. 30, close to the Odeon. The building houses the radio stations Capital, Capital Xtra, Classic FM, Gold, Heart, LBC, Smooth Radio and Radio X.

====Cinemas====

The Empire theatre on the north side of the square was converted into a cinema in 1928. It was the largest on the square until 1959, when a new projection box was built in the centre of the stalls for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, reducing the seating capacity from 2,778 to 1,723. In 1961, the building was gutted and a new cinema and dance hall were built in the shell. In 2013 the main auditorium was divided into two screens, including an IMAX screen.

Adjoining the Empire was the Ritz Cinema, opened by MGM in 1937. It played &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; for four years from 1940 to 1944. It became a second screen for the Empire in 1972 and was converted to a 4DX screen in 2018. In 2023 it was closed due to a dispute with the building&#x27;s landlord.

On the south side, the Leicester Square Theatre opened in 1930. It was renamed the Odeon West End in 1988 and was earmarked for demolition in 2014, to be replaced by a ten-storey hotel including a two-screen cinema. The new cinema opened in 2021 as the Odeon Luxe West End.

The Odeon Leicester Square, which dominates the east side of the square, hosts many film premieres. Opened in 1937 on the site of the Alhambra Theatre, it originally had a capacity for 2,116 people, arranged in circle and stalls. Following changes at the Empire, in the 1960s it became the largest cinema on the square. It later became the largest cinema in the United Kingdom. The seating capacity was reduced to 800 following refurbishment in 2018.

On the other side of the Empire was the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, which started showing newsreels in the 1930s and was then converted into a Jacey Cinema in 1960. It closed in 1978 and is now a casino.

The Warner Theatre, near the north east corner, opened in 1938 on the site of the former Daly&#x27;s Theatre. The Warner was demolished and rebuilt in 1993. In 2004, it was taken over by Vue. In 2006, it was one of the first two cinemas in Europe to screen a film in Digital 3D with &quot;Chicken Little&quot;.

A short distance from the west of the square, on the south side of Panton Street, is the Odeon Panton Street. The Prince Charles Cinema, to the north of the square opened in 1962 with a &quot;satellite dish&quot; design where the audience looks upwards to the stage. The cinema became known for showing pornographic and erotic films during the 1970s, including &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; (1974). It later became a favourite venue for showing cult films, including &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975) and a sing-along version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), and marathon performances including all seven Muppet films back to back. Prices are considerably cheaper than the main cinemas in the square; in 2013 a ticket for a new release at the Prince Charles cost £10, compared to £24 at the Odeon.
Due to the Leicester Square&#x27;s long association with cinema, a film-themed sculpture trail entitled &quot;Scenes in the Square&quot; was installed. In February 2020, eight sculptures were installed which depict characters from the last 100 years of cinema including Laurel and Hardy, Mary Poppins, Batman, Bugs Bunny, Don Lockwood portrayed by Gene Kelly, Paddington Bear, Mr. Bean, and Wonder Woman. In September 2020, a statue of Harry Potter riding a Nimbus 2000 was installed, becoming the ninth statue in the exhibition. In June 2021, a statue of the Iron Throne from HBO TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; was unveiled to mark 10 years since the release of the first episode.

===Other attractions===
Leicester Square is one of several places in the West End that puts on events relating to the Chinese New Year. The celebrations are organised by the London Chinatown Chinese Association and held on the first Sunday during the new year period. Events include music, acrobatics and dancing. In 2015, the celebrations attracted more than 1,000 participants, becoming the largest of their kind in the UK. These included lion dances, a show of the Cultures of China and a drum show. A parade ran nearby through Charing Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue.

The Royal Dental Hospital and school was based at 40–41 from 1874 to 1901 and at 31–36 from 1901 to 1985, when the building was redeveloped as the Hampshire Hotel.

The School of English operated on Leicester Square from 1992 until its closure in 2015. It taught over 25,000 students during its years of operation.

To the west of the square was the location for the Swiss Centre from 1966 to 2008. The area is now named Swiss Court and still features a Swiss glockenspiel clock. M&amp;M&#x27;s World is now on the former site of the Swiss Centre.

The world&#x27;s largest Lego store opened at 3 Swiss Court in November 2016. The opening was marked by unveiling a high model of Big Ben made out of 200,000 Lego bricks.

In 2022, Burger King announced it would open its first meat-free restaurant in Leicester Square. The restaurant is scheduled to operate from 14 March to 10 April.

===Infrastructure===
The main electrical substation for the West End is beneath the square. The electrical cables to the substation are in a large tunnel ending at Leicester Square, and originating in Wimbledon, at Plough Lane, behind the former Wimbledon F.C. football ground, before which the cables are above ground.

==Cultural references==
In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St André claimed to have delivered rabbits from Mary Toft, a woman who lived at No. 27 Leicester Square. The event was widely reported around London, attracting interest from King George I and Royal Society president Hans Sloane. Shortly afterwards, the woman was caught trying to buy a rabbit in secret, and the incident was uncovered as a hoax.

Leicester Square is commemorated in the lyrics of the music hall song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; along with nearby Piccadilly, which became popular with soldiers during World War I. During the war, British inmates of Ruhleben Prisoner of War camp mentioned the square in a song: &quot;Shout this chorus all you can. We want the people there, to hear in Leicester Square, That we&#x27;re the boys that never get downhearted.&quot; It is mentioned in the lyrics of several rock &amp; pop band tracks, including the Rolling Stones&#x27; notorious &quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot;, (1970) &quot;Jeffrey Goes To Leicester Square&quot; on Jethro Tull&#x27;s album &quot;Stand Up&quot; (1969), &quot;Emit Remmus&quot; on the album &quot;Californication&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (1999), &quot;He&#x27;s on the Phone&quot; (1995) by Saint Etienne and &quot;Leicester Square&quot; on Rancid&#x27;s &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; (1998). A verse in &quot;Something About England&quot; on the Clash&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; refers back to &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;, including a reference to Leicester Square.

Leicester Square is one of a group of three on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board along with Coventry Street and Piccadilly. The board was set out by designers Victor Watson and Marge Phillips in the order of entertainment on a Saturday night: film at Leicester Square, meal in Coventry Street and hotel on Piccadilly.

==Pronunciation==

The word &quot;Leicester&quot; features the ending &quot;cester&quot; which is with rare exceptions spoken as a simplified pronunciation, so is counterintuitive, a quirk of British English. A report by Premier Inn said Leicester Square was the most mispronounced place in the UK by tourists, usually as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Lie-chester&quot;) Square.

<doc id="93744" wikidata="Q7450361" url="?curid=93744" title="Seneca mythology">
<text>Seneca mythology refers to the mythology of the Onödowáʼga: (Seneca people), one of the six nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) from the northeastern United States and Canada.

Most Seneca stories were transmitted orally, and began to be written down in the nineteenth century. The ethnologist Jeremiah Curtin began transcribing stories in 1883. In 1923, Arthur C. Parker published &quot;Seneca Myths and Folk Tales&quot;. Parker identified eleven factors characterizing Seneca folklore:

* Spirits pervade all nature
* Good spirits are constantly making war upon evil spirits
* There is such a thing as &quot;orenda&quot; or magical power
* Any being possessing orenda may transform himself into any form
* All nature is conscious
* All living creatures have souls
* There is in the heaven world a Master of life and soul
* The spirits of departed men and animals wander over their familiar haunts
* Dreams are experiences of the soul as it leaves the body
* There are monsters that men seldom see
* There are such beings as wizards, witches and sorcerers

==Stories==
Parker classifies the stories into six groups: &quot;When the World was New&quot;, &quot;Boys who Defied Magic and Overcame it&quot;, &quot;Tales of Love and Marriage&quot;, &quot;Horror Tales of Cannibals and Sorcerers&quot;, &quot;Tales of Talking Animals&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Giants, Pygmies, and Monster Bears&quot;.

==Figures==
Some important figures in Seneca mythology are:

* Eagentci (Awëha:&#x27;i—Fertile Earth), whose name translates as &quot;ancient-bodied one&quot;, is the Earth-mother, or First Mother. Her Huron name is Atahensic.
* Djieien was a man-sized spider who survived most attacks because its heart was buried underground. He appears in the tale &quot;Hagowanen and Otʿhegwenhda&quot; and others.
* Djodi&#x27;kwado&#x27; () is a horned serpent. He features in the stories &quot;The Horned Serpent Runs Away with a Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Great Serpent and the Young Wife&quot;. Horned Snake &quot;is a monster serpent of the underwaters and his head is adorned with antlers of great spread... He is capable of transforming himself to the appearance of a man, and as such delights in luring maidens to his abode. In a few instances he appears as the gallant rescuer of women marooned on bewitched islands.&quot;
* Dagwanoenyent is a vicious northern witch who is depicted as a whirlwind. Her child&#x27;s father killed her.
* Gaasyendietha is a fire-breathing dragon that inhabits Lake Ontario. In human form he appears in &quot;The Trials and Death of Inchworm&quot;, &quot;Grandfather and Grandson and an Eagle Woman&quot;, &quot;Tree Worm and his Mother-in-law, Barkworm&quot;, &quot;Flying-Squirrel and the Seasons&quot;, among others.
* Hagondes is a cannibalistic trickster and clown spirit.
* Kaakwha (also Kanawha) is the solar deity and god of light and truth, subordinate to Hawenniyo, a fertility god.
* Dahdahwat are animals who appear in dreams and visions.
* Gagqa () is the crow spirit.
* Awaeh Tegendji (or Yegondji)—&quot;Swan Mother&quot;—is an old woman who lives with her three beautiful daughters. She appears in &quot;The Story of the Girls Who Went for a Husband&quot;.
* Gijesa are spirits of the night sky.
* Hadowe are the Iroquois&#x27; equivalent of Dryads.
* Nyá&#x27;kwaehe:h is a giant hairless bear. Members of the Dewanondiisso:daik&#x27;ta:h (Pygmy Society) include the bones of Nyá&#x27;kwaehe:h in their charm bundles. He appears in the tales &quot;How a Boy outwitted a Nyá&#x27;kwaehe:h&quot;, &quot;Nyá&#x27;kwaehe:h, the Mammoth Bear&quot;, and &quot;The Boy and the Nyá&#x27;kwaehe:h&quot;, and others. He &quot;is the most feared of magic beasts and one of the most frequent among them to enter in to the fortunes of men. He loves to race and in various forms which he assumes, seeks to get men, and particularly boys, to bet their lives on the race, which generally lasts from sunrise to sunset. He has a vulnerable spot on the bottom of one of his feet and unless some hero hits this the monster does not die.&quot;

<doc id="93746" wikidata="Q4659131" url="?curid=93746" title="A Ragamuffin Band">
<text>A Ragamuffin Band was a musical group founded by Rich Mullins in 1993, when he gathered friends from other bands to back him on his &quot;A Liturgy, A Legacy, &amp; A Ragamuffin Band&quot; album. The band continued to record and tour with Mullins, and even carried on after his 1997 death. The group&#x27;s name is derived from Brennan Manning&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel&quot;, which defines &quot;ragamuffins&quot; as &quot;the burdened, the wobbly and weak-kneed, the inconsistent, unsteady disciples... the smart people who know they are stupid... the honest disciples who admit they are scalawags&quot;.

On February 2, 2019 the band reunited to perform &quot;The Jesus Record&quot; in its entirety with several guest artists to raise funds for member Rick Elias, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer the previous year. Elias died two months later on April 2, 2019.

<text>Richard Robert Elias (January 7, 1955 – April 2, 2019) was an American singer and songwriter based in Nashville.

Elias is best known for being a founding member of Rich Mullins&#x27; A Ragamuffin Band, which recorded and toured from 1993 through 2000.

== Biography ==

Elias was born in San Diego, California, eventually attending Azusa Pacific University outside Los Angeles. In 1984, Elias moved to work full-time in L.A. and within a few years would be recording with producer, Niko Bolas.

Later Elias wrote and produced music in Nashville, Tennessee, while performing solo throughout the U.S. and internationally. His music was included in the 1996 movie &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;, &quot;Dawsons Creek&quot;, &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, as well as other albums, independent films, and TV shows. During his career, Elias produced for artists such as Rich Mullins, Amy Grant, Aaron Neville, Michael W. Smith, and Randy Stonehill. He released four solo projects. His work was nominated and awarded by the GMA, UCMVA, and the Nashville Music Awards. His first solo record, &quot;Rick Elias &amp; The Confessions&quot;, was voted No. 58 in the top 100 greatest albums in Christian music, as listed by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; in 2001.

In 2018, it was revealed that he had cancer. A benefit concert was held by members of A Ragamuffin Band and performers from &quot;The Jesus Record&quot; on February 2, 2019, to raise money for his medical bills. Elias died on April 2, 2019, from brain cancer.

<doc id="93748" wikidata="Q3838473" url="?curid=93748" title="Lucia Pamela">
<text>Lucia Pamela (May 1, 1904 – July 25, 2002) was an American musician, nightclub singer, bandleader, and eccentric. She is remembered today largely for a science fiction themed musical album and coloring book concerning an imaginary trip to the Moon.

==Biography==
Pamela was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She traveled to Germany to study at the Beethoven Conservatory of Music and Voice, and joined Flo Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Follies&quot; after her return to the United States. She was voted Miss St. Louis in 1926.

She was featured in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; for memorizing 10,000 songs. She led the all-girl orchestra and Odeon Theatre house band the Musical Pirates, said by some to be the first all-female orchestra, and hosted radio programs including &quot;The Encouragement Hour&quot;, Kansas City, and &quot;Gal About Town&quot;, Fresno.

She produced only one album, &quot;Into Outer Space With Lucia Pamela&quot; (circa 1969, Gulfstream and later on L&#x27;Peg), whose songs are mostly about an imaginary trip to the moon. Described by Neil Strauss as having &quot;the feel of a warped bebop children&#x27;s album, it features Ms. Pamela on all instruments – piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances – accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to Mars and blue winds.&quot; &quot;She played fifteen instruments, including the piano, clarinet, drums, cymbals and what sounds like a theremin.&quot;

The song &quot;Flip Flop Fly&quot; was featured on the radio by Bob and Ray in 1973, but the album was all but forgotten before being reissued in 1992 (record label: Arf! Arf!, recorded from a vinyl source and produced by Irwin Chusid, catalogue #AA-037) to greater acclaim. According to Chusid, &quot;Lucia&#x27;s performances are spirited and energetic, without an ounce of self-consciousness.&quot;

She also produced a cartoon coloring book, &quot;Into Outer Space with Lucia Pamela in the Year 2000&quot;. In 1994, the pop group Stereolab recorded a tribute to her, &quot;International Colouring Contest&quot;, on their album &quot;Mars Audiac Quintet&quot;; the intro of the song includes a voice sample of Pamela herself.

She died in 2002, age 98, in Los Angeles. Later that year, Tony Kushner wrote a short play about Lucia Pamela called &quot;Flip Flop Fly&quot;. The play imagines Pamela meeting Queen Geraldine of Albania (who also died in 2002) on the Moon.

==Family==
Her daughter was Georgia Frontiere (1927–2008), owner of the Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams, and her son is Kenneth Francis Irwin. Lucia and Georgia performed duets as the Pamela Sisters.

<text>The Abenaki people are an indigenous peoples of the Americas located in the Northeastern Woodlands region. Their religious beliefs are part of the &quot;Midewiwin&quot; tradition, with ceremonies led by medicine keepers, called &quot;Medeoulin&quot; or &quot;Mdawinno&quot;.

==Creation==
In Abenaki mythology the highest deity is Gici Niwaskw, also referred to by the titles of Tabaldak or Dabaldak, meaning Lord, and Niwaskowôgan, meaning Great Spirit. According to the creation myth, there existed no sound or color prior until Gici Niwaskw desired it and began the process of creating the world. To do so he called forth a giant turtle, called Tolba, from the primordial waters, crafting the land on top of Tolba’s shell and the clouds above that. After this creation the Great Spirit fell asleep and began to dream of every creature and plant to ever exist, waking to discover that his dreams had become reality as he had slept. Thus the newly created world was populated by living things.

=== Gluskab and The Transition Between Ages ===

The main character noted for being responsible for the care of Gici Niwaskw’s creations and the transition between the three ages is Gluskab, known by different names such as Glooscap, Glooskap, Gluskabe, and Klooskomba throughout the various Abenaki branch tribes. While not a full deity within the mythology Gluskab is characterized as a being with supernatural powers who uses them to make life easier for humankind while maintaining a fondness for trickery and playing pranks on people.

One of Gluskab’s many feats was tricking the great eagle Pamola, who creates wind by beating his wings, to allow him to tie his wings, and freeing them once the eagle promised to only cause storms sometimes. Gluskab is also credited with shrinking beavers to their modern size, as during the Ancient Age they were larger than humans. He did this by petting them on their heads, and with each pet, he used his magic to cause them to grow smaller and smaller. The most common tale was of Gluskab turning the syrup within maple trees to sap. Initially, syrup could be found directly in maple trees, so the humans sat under the trees all day and let the sweet treat drip directly into their mouths, leaving the fields untended and homes unkempt. Gluskab poured water into the maple trees to dilute the syrup, which meant that humans could no longer have maple syrup without collecting it and boiling it down for much less than they had gathered. Thus Gluskab ensured humans would not grow lazy in their lives.

In some versions of his story, Gluskab is noted as being the twin of Malsum or Malsumis, a more malevolent being that seeks to make life harder for humans rather than easier. However, there is some doubt of whether this version actually comes from Abenaki mythology or if it is a misattributed Iroquois tale, as there exists only one known source for it within the Abenaki tribes and no wider knowledge of it within them.

==Three Ages==
Since the creation, it is believed by the Abenaki that the world has gone through three separate ages, defined by humanity and its relationship with the other animals. First, there is the Ancient Age, where humans and animals are viewed as equal, followed by the Golden Age, where humans begin to separate themselves from being like the other animals. Finally, there is the Present Age, which is marked by the current status of humans being completely separate from the rest of the animals.

<doc id="93750" wikidata="Q4961254" url="?curid=93750" title="Brennan Manning">
<text>Richard Francis Xavier Manning, known as Brennan Manning (April 27, 1934 – April 12, 2013) was an American author, laicized priest, and public speaker. He is best known for his bestselling book &quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel&quot;.

==Early life==
Manning was born in Depression-era Brooklyn, New York City, and was one of three children. After studying at St. John&#x27;s University in Queens for two years, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and fought in the Korean War. After returning to the U.S., he studied journalism.

==Spiritual life==

In February 1956, he had a powerful experience of the personal love of Jesus Christ. He noted that, &quot;At that moment, the entire Christian life became for me an intimate, heartfelt relationship with Jesus.&quot; He went on to study at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in philosophy in 1960 and then continuing to study theology. In May 1963, he graduated from St. Francis Seminary and was ordained into the Franciscan priesthood. He took the name &quot;Brennan&quot; which was partly based on Saint Brendan but also to honor a friend of the same name.

In the late 1960s, Manning joined the Little Brothers of Jesus of Charles de Foucauld, a religious institute committed to an uncloistered, contemplative life among the poor. Manning transported water via donkey, worked as a mason&#x27;s assistant and a dishwasher in France, was imprisoned (by choice) in Switzerland, and spent six months in a remote cave in the Zaragoza desert.

In the 1970s, Manning returned to the US and began writing after confronting his alcoholism. He entered rehab at the Hazelden Foundation in Center City, Minnesota.

==Public life==
By 1982, he had published several books and he decided to leave the Franciscan order. He moved to New Orleans and married Roslyn Ann Walker. He struggled with alcohol for the rest of his life and he and Roslyn divorced in 2000.

Mannings&#x27; writings led to a more public ministry, and he was often asked to speak and to lead spiritual retreats. He saw his work as sharing the news of God&#x27;s love for people.

Manning was often public about his faults, noting at his high school reunion that during his life he had been &quot;promiscuous, a liar, envious of the gifts of others, insufferably arrogant, a people-pleaser and a braggart&quot;, but he shared how, &quot;By sheer undeserved grace, I&#x27;ve been able to abandon myself in unshaken trust to the compassion and mercy of Jesus Christ.&quot;

==Popular culture==

At one event he led singer Rich Mullins on a three-day silent retreat. This started a life-long friendship between the two, and Mullins named his backing group &quot;a Ragamuffin Band.&quot;

The following quote appeared in the prelude to dc Talk&#x27;s song &quot;What if I Stumble?&quot; It also appeared on an intro track for the Christian metalcore band War of Ages on its album &quot;Fire from the Tomb&quot;:

==Death==
Manning died on April 12, 2013, in New Orleans. He died of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, a neurological disorder which may have been accelerated by misuse of alcohol.
