<text>A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

For example, a greedy strategy for the travelling salesman problem (which is of high computational complexity) is the following heuristic: &quot;At each step of the journey, visit the nearest unvisited city.&quot; This heuristic does not intend to find the best solution, but it terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution to such a complex problem typically requires unreasonably many steps. 

In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms optimally solve combinatorial problems having the properties of matroids and give constant-factor approximations to optimization problems with the submodular structure.

==Specifics==
Greedy algorithms produce good solutions on some mathematical problems, but not on others. Most problems for which they work will have two properties:

; Greedy choice property: Whichever choice seems best at a given moment can be made and then (recursively) solve the remaining sub-problems. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far, but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words, a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices. This is the main difference from dynamic programming, which is exhaustive and is guaranteed to find the solution. After every stage, dynamic programming makes decisions based on all the decisions made in the previous stage and may reconsider the previous stage&#x27;s algorithmic path to the solution.
;Optimal substructure: &quot;A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the sub-problems.&quot;

===Correctness Proofs=== 
A common technique for proving the correctness of greedy algorithms uses an inductive exchange argument. The exchange argument demonstrates that any solution different from the greedy solution can be transformed into the greedy solution without degrading its quality. This proof pattern typically follows these steps:

This proof pattern typically follows these steps (by contradictio): 
# Assume there exists an optimal solution different from the greedy solution 
# Identify the first point where the optimal and greedy solutions differ 
# Prove that exchanging the optimal choice for the greedy choice at this point cannot worsen the solution 
# Conclude by induction that there must exist an optimal solution identical to the greedy solution 

In some cases, an additional step may be needed to prove that no optimal solution can strictly improve upon the greedy solution.

===Cases of failure===
Greedy algorithms fail to produce the optimal solution for many other problems and may even produce the &quot;unique worst possible&quot; solution. One example is the travelling salesman problem mentioned above: for each number of cities, there is an assignment of distances between the cities for which the nearest-neighbour heuristic produces the unique worst possible tour.
For other possible examples, see horizon effect.

==Types==

Greedy algorithms can be characterized as being &#x27;short sighted&#x27;, and also as &#x27;non-recoverable&#x27;. They are ideal only for problems that have an &#x27;optimal substructure&#x27;. Despite this, for many simple problems, the best-suited algorithms are greedy. It is important, however, to note that the greedy algorithm can be used as a selection algorithm to prioritize options within a search, or branch-and-bound algorithm. There are a few variations to the greedy algorithm:

* Pure greedy algorithms
* Orthogonal greedy algorithms
* Relaxed greedy algorithms

==Theory==
Greedy algorithms have a long history of study in combinatorial optimization and theoretical computer science. Greedy heuristics are known to produce suboptimal results on many problems, and so natural questions are:

* For which problems do greedy algorithms perform optimally?
* For which problems do greedy algorithms guarantee an approximately optimal solution?
* For which problems are the greedy algorithm guaranteed &quot;not&quot; to produce an optimal solution?

A large body of literature exists answering these questions for general classes of problems, such as matroids, as well as for specific problems, such as set cover.

===Matroids===

A matroid is a mathematical structure that generalizes the notion of linear independence from vector spaces to arbitrary sets. If an optimization problem has the structure of a matroid, then the appropriate greedy algorithm will solve it optimally.

===Submodular functions===

A function formula_1 defined on subsets of a set formula_2 is called submodular if for every formula_3 we have that formula_4.

Suppose one wants to find a set formula_5 which maximizes formula_1. The greedy algorithm, which builds up a set formula_5 by incrementally adding the element which increases formula_1 the most at each step, produces as output a set that is at least formula_9. That is, greedy performs within a constant factor of formula_10 as good as the optimal solution.

Similar guarantees are provable when additional constraints, such as cardinality constraints, are imposed on the output, though often slight variations on the greedy algorithm are required. See for an overview.

===Other problems with guarantees===
Other problems for which the greedy algorithm gives a strong guarantee, but not an optimal solution, include

* Set cover
* The Steiner tree problem
* Load balancing
* Independent set

Many of these problems have matching lower bounds; i.e., the greedy algorithm does not perform better than the guarantee in the worst case.

==Applications==

Greedy algorithms typically (but not always) fail to find the globally optimal solution because they usually do not operate exhaustively on all the data. They can make commitments to certain choices too early, preventing them from finding the best overall solution later. For example, all known greedy coloring algorithms for the graph coloring problem and all other NP-complete problems do not consistently find optimum solutions. Nevertheless, they are useful because they are quick to think up and often give good approximations to the optimum.

If a greedy algorithm can be proven to yield the global optimum for a given problem class, it typically becomes the method of choice because it is faster than other optimization methods like dynamic programming. Examples of such greedy algorithms are Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm and Prim&#x27;s algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees and the algorithm for finding optimum Huffman trees.

Greedy algorithms appear in the network routing as well. Using greedy routing, a message is forwarded to the neighbouring node which is &quot;closest&quot; to the destination. The notion of a node&#x27;s location (and hence &quot;closeness&quot;) may be determined by its physical location, as in geographic routing used by ad hoc networks. Location may also be an entirely artificial construct as in small world routing and distributed hash table.

==Examples==
* The activity selection problem is characteristic of this class of problems, where the goal is to pick the maximum number of activities that do not clash with each other.
* In the Macintosh computer game &quot;Crystal Quest&quot; the objective is to collect crystals, in a fashion similar to the travelling salesman problem. The game has a demo mode, where the game uses a greedy algorithm to go to every crystal. The artificial intelligence does not account for obstacles, so the demo mode often ends quickly.
* The matching pursuit is an example of a greedy algorithm applied on signal approximation.
* A greedy algorithm finds the optimal solution to Malfatti&#x27;s problem of finding three disjoint circles within a given triangle that maximize the total area of the circles; it is conjectured that the same greedy algorithm is optimal for any number of circles.
* A greedy algorithm is used to construct a Huffman tree during Huffman coding where it finds an optimal solution.
* In decision tree learning, greedy algorithms are commonly used, however they are not guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
**One popular such algorithm is the ID3 algorithm for decision tree construction.
*Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and the related A* search algorithm are verifiably optimal greedy algorithms for graph search and shortest path finding. 
**A* search is conditionally optimal, requiring an &quot;admissible heuristic&quot; that will not overestimate path costs.
*Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm and Prim&#x27;s algorithm are greedy algorithms for constructing minimum spanning trees of a given connected graph. They always find an optimal solution, which may not be unique in general.
*The Sequitur and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithms are greedy algorithms for grammar induction.

<doc id="89251" wikidata="Q18966" url="?curid=89251" title="Sweet corn">
<text>Sweet corn (&quot;Zea mays&quot; convar. &quot;saccharata&quot; var. &quot;rugosa&quot;), also called sweetcorn, sugar corn and pole corn, is a variety of maize grown for human consumption with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Sweet corn is picked when still immature (the milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, unlike field corn, which is harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage). Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.

It is one of the six major types of corn, the others being dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, and flour corn.

According to the USDA, 100 grams of raw yellow sweet corn contains 3.43 g glucose, 1.94 g fructose, and 0.89 g sucrose.


==History==
In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with corn seeds, although this revelation did not succeed due to inadequate education of how to produce corn. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The European cultivation of sweet corn occurred when the Iroquois tribes grew the first recorded sweet corn (called &#x27;Papoon&#x27;) for European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in the southern and central regions of the United States.


Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are &#x27;Country Gentleman&#x27; (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and &#x27;Stowell&#x27;s Evergreen&#x27;.

Sweet corn production in the 20th century was influenced by the following key developments:
*hybridization allowed for more uniform maturity, improved quality and disease resistance
**In 1933 &#x27;Golden Cross Bantam&#x27; was released. It is significant for being the first successful single-cross hybrid and the first specifically developed for disease resistance (Stewart&#x27;s wilt in this case).
*identification of the separate gene mutations responsible for sweetness in corn and the ability to breed cultivars based on these characteristics:
**&quot;su&quot; (normal sugary)
**&quot;se&quot; (sugary enhanced, originally called Everlasting Heritage)
**&quot;sh2&quot; (shrunken-2)

There are currently hundreds of cultivars, with more constantly being developed.

==Anatomy==

The fruit of the sweet corn plant is the corn &quot;kernel&quot;, a type of fruit called a caryopsis. The &quot;ear&quot; is a collection of kernels on the &quot;cob&quot;. Because corn is a monocot, there is always an even number of rows of kernels. The ear is covered by tightly wrapped leaves called the &quot;husk&quot;. &quot;Silk&quot; is the name for the pistillate flowers, which emerge from the husk. The husk and silk are removed by hand, before boiling but not necessarily before roasting, in a process called &quot;husking&quot; or &quot;shucking&quot;.

==Consumption==

In most of Latin America, sweet corn is traditionally eaten with beans. Although both corn and beans contain all 9 essential amino acids, eating a wide variety of foods in one day that includes grains and beans ensures the right balance of essential amino acids. In Brazil, sweet corn cut off from the cobs is generally eaten with peas (where this combination, given the practicality of steamed canned grains in an urban diet, is a frequent addition to diverse meals such as salads, stews, seasoned white rice, risottos, soups, pasta, and whole sausage hot dogs).

In Malaysia, there exists a variety unique to the Cameron Highlands named &quot;pearl corn&quot;. The kernels are glossy white, resembling pearls, and can be eaten raw off the cob, although they are often boiled in water and salt.

In the Philippines, boiled sweet corn kernels are served hot with margarine and cheese powder as an inexpensive snack sold by street vendors.

Similarly, sweet corn in Indonesia is traditionally ground or soaked with milk, which makes available the B vitamin niacin in the corn, the absence of which would otherwise lead to pellagra. Cheese and condensed milk are added to sweet corn in the snack &quot;jasuke&quot;, short for &quot;jagung susu keju&quot;.

In Brazil, a combination of ground sweet corn and milk is also the basis of various well-known dishes, such as &quot;pamonha&quot; and the pudding-like dessert , while sweet corn eaten directly off the cob tends to be served with butter.

In Europe and Asia sweet corn is often used as a pizza topping or in salads. Corn on the cob is a sweet corn cob that has been boiled, steamed, or grilled whole; the kernels are then cut off and eaten or eaten directly off the cob. Creamed corn is sweet corn served in a milk or cream sauce. Sweet corn can also be eaten as baby corn. Corn soup can be made adding water, butter and flour, with salt and pepper for seasoning.

In the United States, sweet corn is eaten as a steamed vegetable or on the cob, and is usually served with butter and salt. It can be found in Tex-Mex cooking in chili, tacos, and salads. Corn mixed and cooked with lima beans is one form of succotash. Sweet corn is one of the most popular vegetables in the United States, being most popular in the southern and central regions of the country, and can be purchased either fresh, canned, or frozen. Sweet corn ranks among the top ten vegetables in value and per capita consumption.

If left to dry on the plant, kernels may be taken off the cob and cooked in oil where, unlike popcorn, they expand to about double the original kernel size and are often called corn nuts.

=== Health benefits ===

Cooking sweet corn increases levels of ferulic acid, which has anti-cancer properties.

==Cultivars==

Open pollinated (non-hybrid) corn has largely been replaced in the commercial market by sweeter, earlier hybrids, which also have the advantage of maintaining their sweet flavor longer. &quot;su&quot; cultivars are best when cooked within 30 minutes of harvest. Despite their short storage life, many open-pollinated cultivars such as &#x27;Golden Bantam&#x27; remain popular for home gardeners and specialty markets or are marketed as heirloom seeds. Although less sweet, they are often described as more tender and flavorful than hybrids.

===Genetics===

Early cultivars, including those used by Native Americans, were the result of the mutant &quot;su&quot; (&quot;sugary&quot;) or &quot;su1&quot; () allele of an isoamylase. They contain about 5–10% sugar by weight. These varieties are juicy due to the phytoglycogen content, but they lose sugar quickly after harvest, with the content halving in 24 hours.

&quot;Supersweet corn&quot; are cultivars of sweet corn which produce higher than normal levels of sugar developed by University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign professor John Laughnan. He was investigating two specific genes in sweet corn, one of which, the &quot;sh2&quot; mutation (, a Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase), caused the corn to shrivel when dry. After further investigation, Laughnan discovered that the endosperm of &quot;sh2&quot; sweet corn kernels store less starch and from 4 to 10 times more sugar than normal &quot;su&quot; sweet corn. He published his findings in 1953, disclosing the advantages of growing supersweet sweet corn, but many corn breeders lacked enthusiasm for the new supersweet corn due to the seed shiveling reducing germination rate.

Illinois Foundation Seeds Inc. was the first seed company to release a supersweet corn and it was called &#x27;Illini Xtra Sweet&#x27;, but widespread use of supersweet hybrids did not occur until the early 1980s. The popularity of supersweet corn rose due to its long shelf life and large sugar content when compared to conventional sweet corn. This has allowed the long-distance shipping of sweet corn and has enabled manufacturers to can sweet corn without adding extra sugar or salt. Breeding has resolved the germination rate issue, but it is still generally true that &quot;sh2&quot; corn is less juicy than their &quot;su&quot; counterparts. &quot;sh2-i&quot; (&quot;shrunken2-intermediate&quot;) cultivars under development exploits a different mutation on the same gene to try and create varieties that are both juicy and sweet.

The third gene mutation to be discovered is the &quot;se&quot; (or &quot;se1&quot;) for &quot;sugary enhanced&quot; allele, responsible for so-called &quot;Everlasting Heritage&quot; cultivars, such as &#x27;Kandy Korn&#x27;. Cultivars with the &quot;se&quot; alleles have a longer storage life and contain 12–20% sugar. The gene for &quot;Se1&quot; has been located.
All of the alleles responsible for sweet corn are recessive, so it must be isolated from other corn, such as field corn and popcorn, that release pollen at the same time; the endosperm develops from genes from both parents, and heterozygous kernels will be tough and starchy. The &quot;se&quot; and &quot;su&quot; alleles do not need to be isolated from each other. However supersweet cultivars containing the &quot;sh2&quot; allele must be grown in isolation from other cultivars to avoid cross-pollination and resulting starchiness, either in space (various sources quote minimum quarantine distances from 100 to 400 feet or 30 to 120 m) or in time (i.e., the supersweet corn does not pollinate at the same time as other corn in nearby fields).

Modern breeding methods have also introduced cultivars incorporating multiple gene types:
*&quot;sy&quot; (for &quot;synergistic&quot;) adds the &quot;sh2&quot; gene to some kernels (usually 25%) on the same cob as a &quot;se&quot; base (either homozygous or heterozygous)
*&quot;augmented sh2&quot; adds the &quot;se&quot; and &quot;su&quot; gene to a &quot;sh2&quot; parent
Often seed producers of the &quot;sy&quot; and &quot;augmented sh2&quot; types will use brand names or trademarks to distinguish these cultivars instead of mentioning the genetics behind them. Generally these brands or trademarks will offer a choice of white, bi-color and yellow cultivars which otherwise have very similar characteristics.

===Genetically modified corn===
Genetically modified sweet corn is available to commercial growers to resist certain insects or herbicides, or both. Such transgenic varieties are not available to home or small acreage growers due to protocols that must be followed in their production.

<doc id="89256" wikidata="Q1153386" url="?curid=89256" title="Agama (lizard)">
<text>Agama (from Sranan Tongo meaning &quot;lizard&quot;) is a genus of small-to-moderate-sized, long-tailed, insectivorous Old World lizards. The genus &quot;Agama&quot; includes at least 37 species in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, where most regions are home to at least one species. Eurasian agamids are largely assigned to genus &quot;Laudakia&quot;. The various species differ in size, ranging from about in length, when fully grown.

Their colour also differs between species, between genders, and according to mood; for example, a dominant male in display mode is far brighter than when it has been caught, beaten by another male, or otherwise alarmed. Females tend to be less colourful than the males of the species.

According to species, agamas live in forest, in bush, among rocks and on crags, but where their habitat has been cleared, or simply occupied by humans, some species also adapt to life in villages and compounds, for example inside the thatch of huts and other sheltering crevices. Agamids&#x27; hind legs generally are long and powerful; and the lizards can run and leap swiftly when alarmed.

Agamas are diurnal, active during the day. They can tolerate higher temperatures than most reptiles, but when temperatures approach 38 °C (100 °F) they generally shelter in the shade. Males frequently threaten each other by nodding, weaving, and displaying their brightest colours to establish dominance. If that is insufficient, they lash their tails and threaten each other with open jaws. The jaws are very powerful, and older males commonly have damaged tails as souvenirs of past combat. Females may sometimes chase and fight one another, and hatchlings mimic the adults&#x27; behaviour.

Agamas are mainly insectivorous, hunting prey by sight and snatching it opportunistically. Their incisor-like front teeth and powerful jaws are adapted to dealing with quite large, hard prey. They also may eat eggs of other lizards, and sometimes feed on vegetable matter, such as suitable grass, berries, and seeds.

Though not formally polygamous, dominant males commonly accommodate several females at a time in their territory. During courtship, and also when asserting his territory, the male bobs his head in display; this gives rise to some of the common names, such as Afrikaans &quot;koggelmander&quot; (literally, &quot;little mocking man&quot;). Females occasionally initiate courtship by offering their hindquarters to the male and provoking him to catch her. Typically the breeding season is timed for eggs to be laid during the season after the rains. Eggs are laid in clutches of up to 12, depending on species and the size of the female.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
In the &quot;10th edition of Systema Naturae&quot; of 1758, Linnaeus used the name Agama (pg. 288) as the species &quot;Lacerta Agama&quot; (with Agama originally capitalized to indicate a name in apposition rather than a Latin adjective, which he would have made lowercase). His own earlier description from 1749 was derived from Seba, who described and illustrated a number of lizards as &quot;Salamandra amphibia&quot; and &quot;Salamandra Americana&quot;, said to resemble in some ways a chameleon lizard and that supposedly came (in error) from &quot;America.&quot; Seba did not use the term &quot;agama&quot;, however. Linnaeus repeated Seba&#x27;s error in stating that the lizards lived in the Americas [&quot;habitat in America&quot;], and he included other types of lizards shown and mentioned by Seba under his species name &quot;Agama&quot;.

Daudin later created the new genus, &quot;Agama&quot;, to incorporate various African and Asian lizards, as well as species from Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. He noted that the name &quot;agama&quot; was used by inhabitants of Guiana for a species that he included in the genus &quot;Agama&quot;.

The word &quot;agama&quot; has been traced to West African Gbe languages as a name for the chameleon. The word was brought to Dutch Guiana (modern Suriname) by imported West African slaves and was then used in local creole languages for types of local lizards. Linnaeus may have taken the name &quot;agama&quot; from some unidentified source in the mistaken belief that the reptiles came from the Americas as indicated by Seba.

The name &quot;agama&quot; has no connection to either Greek &quot;agamos&quot; &quot;unmarried&quot; (as a supposed Latin feminine &quot;agama&quot;) or to Greek &quot;agamai&quot; &quot;wonder&quot; as sometimes suggested.

Because of the confusion over the actual taxon that was the basis for the name &quot;Agama agama&quot;, Wagner, et al. (2009) designated a neotype (ZFMK 15222), using a previously described specimen from Cameroon in the collection of the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig in Bonn.

<text>The Boeing 777, commonly referred to as the Triple Seven, is an American long-range wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The 777 is the world&#x27;s largest twinjet and the most-built wide-body airliner.

The jetliner was designed to bridge the gap between Boeing&#x27;s other wide body airplanes, the twin-engined 767 and quad-engined 747, and to replace aging DC-10 and L-1011 trijets. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 program was launched in October 1990, with an order from United Airlines. The prototype aircraft rolled out in April 1994, and first flew in June of that year. The 777 entered service with the launch operator United Airlines in June 1995. Longer-range variants were launched in 2000, and first delivered in 2004.
The Triple Seven can accommodate a ten–abreast seating layout and has a typical 3-class capacity of 301 to 368 passengers, with a range of . The jetliner is recognizable for its large-diameter turbofan engines, raked wingtips, six wheels on each main landing gear, fully circular fuselage cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone. The 777 became the first Boeing airliner to use fly-by-wire controls and to apply a carbon composite structure in the tailplanes. 

The original 777 with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of was produced in two fuselage lengths: the initial 777-200 was followed by the extended-range -200ER in 1997; and the longer 777-300 in 1998. These have since been known as 777 Classics and were powered by General Electric GE90, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. The extended-range 777-300ER, with a MTOW of , entered service in 2004, the longer-range 777-200LR in 2006, and the 777F freighter in 2009. These second-generation 777 variants have extended raked wingtips and are powered exclusively by GE90 engines. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of the third generation 777X (variants include the 777-8, 777-9, and 777-8F), featuring composite wings with folding wingtips and General Electric GE9X engines, and slated for first deliveries in 2026.

, Emirates was the largest operator with a fleet of 163 aircraft. , more than 60 customers have placed orders for 2,305 777s across all variants, of which 1,742 have been delivered. This makes the 777 the best-selling wide-body airliner, while its best-selling variant is the 777-300ER with 833 delivered. The airliner initially competed with the Airbus A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11; since 2015, it has mainly competed with the Airbus A350. First-generation 777-200 variants are to be supplanted by Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliner. , the 777 has been involved in 31 aviation accidents and incidents, including five hull loss accidents out of eight total hull losses with 542 fatalities including 3 ground casualties.

==Development==

===Background===
In the early 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar became the first generation of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine or twinjet Boeing 7N7 (later named Boeing 757) to replace its 727, the twinjet Boeing 7X7 (later named 767) to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet &quot;777&quot; concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s&#x27; extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet &quot;777&quot; was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.

By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were expected to be retired in the next decade, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas was working on the MD-11, a stretched successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340 series. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements. However, airline customers were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an operating cost lower than that of any 767 stretch.

Airline planners&#x27; requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a clean-sheet design, which became the twinjet 777. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.

===Design effort===
Alan Mulally served as the Boeing 777 program&#x27;s director of engineering, and then was promoted in September 1992 to lead it as vice-president and general manager. The design phase of the all-new twinjet was different from Boeing&#x27;s previous jetliners; eight major airlines (All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines) played a role in the 777 development. This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input. The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the &quot;Working Together&quot; group. At the group&#x27;s first meeting in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines, asking what each wanted in the design. By March 1990, the group had decided upon a baseline configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747&#x27;s, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and 10 percent better seat-mile costs than the Airbus A330 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11.

The development phase of the 777 coincided with United Airlines replacement program for its aging DC-10s. On October 14, 1990, United became the launch customer with an order for 34 Pratt &amp; Whitney-powered 777s valued at US$11 billion (~$ in ) and options for 34 more. The airline required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a hot and high airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United&#x27;s Hawaii routes. In late 1991, Boeing selected its Everett factory in Washington, home of 747 and 787 production, as the 777&#x27;s final assembly line (FAL). In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways&#x27; input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options.

The 777 was the first commercial aircraft to be developed using an entirely computer-aided design (CAD) process. Each design drawing was created on a three-dimensional CAD software system known as CATIA, sourced from Dassault Systèmes and IBM. This allowed engineers to virtually assemble the 777 aircraft on a computer system to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly before the actual assembly process—thus reducing costly rework. Boeing developed its high-performance visualization system, FlyThru, later called IVT (Integrated Visualization Tool) to support large-scale collaborative engineering design reviews, production illustrations, and other uses of the CAD data outside of engineering. Boeing was initially not convinced of CATIA&#x27;s abilities and built a physical mock-up of the nose section to verify its results. The test was so successful that additional mock-ups were canceled. The 777 was completed with such precision that it was the first Boeing jetliner that did not require the details to be worked out on an expensive physical aircraft mock-up. This helped the design program to limit costs to a reported $5 billion.

=== Testing and certification ===
Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993. On April 9, 1994, the first 777, number WA001, was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing&#x27;s nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs.

At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.

===Entry into service===
Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15, 1995. The FAA awarded 180-minute ETOPS clearance (&quot;ETOPS-180&quot;) for the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4084-engined aircraft on May 30, 1995, making it the first airliner to carry an ETOPS-180 rating at its entry into service. The first commercial flight took place on June 7, 1995, from London Heathrow Airport to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. Longer ETOPS clearance of 207 minutes was approved in October 1996.

On November 12, 1995, Boeing delivered the first model with General Electric GE90-77B engines to British Airways, which entered service five days later. Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear issues, which caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997, returning to full service later that year. General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades.

The first Rolls-Royce Trent 877-powered aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways International on March 31, 1996, completing the introduction of the three power plants initially developed for the airliner. Each engine-aircraft combination had secured ETOPS-180 certification from its entry into service. By June 1997, orders for the 777 numbered 323 from 25 airlines, including launch customers that had ordered additional aircraft. Operations performance data established the consistent capabilities of the twinjet over long-haul transoceanic routes, leading to additional sales. By 1998, the 777 fleet had approached 900,000 flight hours. Boeing states that the 777 fleet has a dispatch reliability (rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues) above 99 percent.

=== Improvement and stretching: -200ER/-300 ===
After the baseline model, the 777-200, Boeing developed an increased gross weight variant with greater range and payload capability. Initially named 777-200IGW, the 777-200ER first flew on October 7, 1996, received FAA and JAA certification on January 17, 1997, and entered service with British Airways on February 9, 1997. Offering greater long-haul performance, the variant became the most widely ordered version of the aircraft through the early 2000s. On April 2, 1997, a Malaysia Airlines -200ER named &quot;Super Ranger&quot; broke the great circle &quot;distance without landing&quot; record for an airliner by flying eastward from Boeing Field, Seattle to Kuala Lumpur, a distance of , in 21 hours and 23 minutes.

Following the introduction of the -200ER, Boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the baseline model. On October 16, 1997, the 777-300 made its first flight. At in length, the -300 became the longest airliner yet produced (until the A340-600), and had a 20 percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model. The -300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the FAA and JAA on May 4, 1998, and entered service with launch customer Cathay Pacific on May 27, 1998.

The first generation of Boeing 777 models, the -200, -200ER, and -300 have since been known collectively as the &quot;Boeing 777 Classics&quot;. These three early 777 variants had three engine options ranging from : General Electric GE90, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800.

=== Production ===
The production process included substantial international content, an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner, later exceeded by the 787. International contributors included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (fuselage panels), Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (center wing section), Hawker de Havilland (elevators), and Aerospace Technologies of Australia (rudder). An agreement between Boeing and the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, representing Japanese aerospace contractors, made the latter risk-sharing partners for 20 percent of the entire development program.
To accommodate production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5 billion (~$ in ) to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methods were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. By the start of production in 1993, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines. Total investment in the program was estimated at over $4 billion from Boeing, with an additional $2 billion from suppliers.

Initially second to the 747 as Boeing&#x27;s most profitable jetliner, the 777 became the company&#x27;s most lucrative model in the 2000s. An analyst established the 777 program, assuming Boeing has fully recouped the plane&#x27;s development costs, may account for $400 million of the company&#x27;s pretax earnings in 2000, $50 million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner accounted for the bulk of wide-body revenues for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program backlog of 356 orders was valued at $95 billion at list prices in 2008.

In 2010, Boeing announced plans to increase production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid-2011, and 8.3 per month by early 2013. In November 2011, assembly of the 1,000th 777, a -300ER, began when it took 49 days to fully assemble one of these variants. The aircraft in question was built for Emirates airline, and rolled out of the production facility in March 2012. By the mid-2010s, the 777 had become prevalent on the longest flights internationally and had become the most widely used airliner for transpacific routes, with variants of the type operating over half of all scheduled flights and with the majority of transpacific carriers. By April 2014, with cumulative sales surpassing those of the 747, the 777 became the best-selling wide-body airliner; at existing production rates, the aircraft was on track to become the most-delivered wide-body airliner by mid-2016.

By February 2015, the backlog of undelivered 777s totaled 278 aircraft, equivalent to nearly three years at the then production rate of 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018–2020 time frame. In January 2016, Boeing confirmed plans to reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X due to a lack of new orders. In August 2017, Boeing was scheduled to drop 777 production again to five per month. In 2018, assembling test 777-9 aircraft was expected to lower output to an effective rate of 5.5 per month. In March 2018, as previously predicted, the 777 overtook the 747 as the world&#x27;s most produced wide body aircraft. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, demand for new jets fell in 2020 and Boeing further reduced monthly 777 production from five to two aircraft.

=== Second generation (777-X): -300ER/-200LR/F ===

From the program&#x27;s start, Boeing had considered building ultra-long-range variants. Early plans centered on a 777-100X proposal, a shortened variant of the -200 with reduced weight and increased range, similar to the 747SP. However, the -100X would have carried fewer passengers than the -200 while having similar operating costs, leading to a higher cost per seat. By the late 1990s, design plans shifted to longer-range versions of existing models.

In March 1997, the Boeing board approved the 777-200X/300X specifications: 298 passengers in three classes over 8,600 nmi (15,900 km; ) for the 200X and (12,200 km; ) with 355 passengers in a tri-class layout for the 300X, with design freeze planned in May 1998, 200X certification in August 2000, and introduction in September and in January 2001 for the 300X. The wider wing was to be strengthened and the fuel capacity enlarged, and it was to be powered by simple derivatives with similar fans. GE was proposing a GE90-102B, while P&amp;W offered its PW4098 and R-R was proposing a Trent 8100. Rolls-Royce was also studying a Trent 8102 over . Boeing was also studying a semi-levered, articulated main gear to help the take-off rotation of the proposed -300X, with its higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW). By January 1999, its MTOW grew to , and thrust requirements increased to .

A more powerful engine in the thrust class of was required, leading to talks between Boeing and engine manufacturers. General Electric offered to develop the GE90-115B engine, while Rolls-Royce proposed developing the Trent 8104 engine. In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, beating out rival proposals. Under the deal with General Electric, Boeing agreed to only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions.
On February 29, 2000, Boeing launched its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn during the early 2000s. The first model to emerge from the program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300&#x27;s added capacity with the -200ER&#x27;s range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.

The second long-range model, the 777-200LR, rolled out on February 15, 2005, and completed its first flight on March 8, 2005. The -200LR was certified by both the FAA and EASA on February 2, 2006, and the first delivery to Pakistan International Airlines occurred on February 26, 2006. On November 10, 2005, the first -200LR set a record for the longest non-stop flight of a passenger airliner by flying eastward from Hong Kong to London. Lasting 22 hours and 42 minutes, the flight surpassed the -200LR&#x27;s standard design range and was logged in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

The production freighter model, the 777F, rolled out on May 23, 2008. The maiden flight of the 777F, which used the structural design and engine specifications of the -200LR along with fuel tanks derived from the -300ER, occurred on July 14, 2008. FAA and EASA type certification for the freighter was received on February 6, 2009, and the first delivery to launch customer Air France took place on February 19, 2009.
By the late 2000s, the 777 was facing increased potential competition from Airbus&#x27; planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed 787 series, both airliners that offer fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received engine and aerodynamics improvement packages for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a maximum zero-fuel weight increase, equivalent to a higher payload of 20–25 passengers; its GE90-115B1 engines received a 1–2.5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher-altitude airports. Through these improvements, the 777 remains the largest twin-engine jetliner in the world.
In 2011, the 787 Dreamliner entered service, the completed first stage a.k.a. the Yellowstone-2 (Y2) of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project, which would replace large variants of the 767 (300/300ER/400) but also small variants of the 777 (-200/200ER/200LR). While the larger variants of the 777 (-300/300ER) as well as the 747 could eventually be replaced by a new generation aircraft, the Yellowstone-3 (Y3), which would draw upon technologies from the 787 Dreamliner (Y2). More changes were targeted for late 2012, including possible extension of the wingspan, along with other major changes, including a composite wing, a new generation engine, and different fuselage lengths. Emirates was reportedly working closely with Boeing on the project, in conjunction with being a potential launch customer for the new 777 generation. Among customers for the aircraft during this period, China Airlines ordered ten 777-300ER aircraft to replace 747-400s on long-haul transpacific routes (with the first of those aircraft entering service in 2015), noting that the 777-300ER&#x27;s per seat cost is about 20% lower than the 747&#x27;s costs (varying due to fuel prices).

=== Improvement packages ===
In tandem with the development of the third generation Boeing 777X, Boeing worked with General Electric to offer a 2% improvement in fuel efficiency to in-production 777-300ER aircraft. General Electric improved the fan module and the high-pressure compressor stage-1 blisk in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduced clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, were stated by GE to lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing&#x27;s wing modifications were intended to deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER&#x27;s fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or of cargo to a &quot;load limited&quot; flight.

In March 2015, additional details of the &quot;improvement package&quot; were unveiled. The 777-300ER was to shed by replacing the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. The new flight control software would eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing was also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip was to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s airfoil&quot; by Boeing; this was originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. Another change involved elevator trim bias. These changes were to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.

Mindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered ten 777-300ERs, normally selling for around $150 million per aircraft, were purchased for $130 million each, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X. In 2019, the list price for the -200ER was $306.6 million, the -200LR: $346.9 million, the -300ER: $375.5 million and 777F: $352.3 million. The -200ER is the only Classic variant listed.

=== Third generation (777X): -8/-8F/-9 ===

In November 2013, with orders and commitments totaling 259 aircraft from Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways, Boeing formally launched the 777X program, the third generation of the 777, with two models: the 777-8 and 777-9. The 777-9 is a further stretched variant with a capacity of over 400 passengers and a range of over , whereas the 777-8 is slated to seat approximately 350 passengers and have a range of over . Both models are to be equipped with new generation GE9X engines and feature new composite wings with folding wingtips. The first member of the 777X family was projected to enter service in 2020 at the time of the program announcement. The roll-out of the prototype 777X, a 777-9 model, occurred on March 13, 2019. The 777-9 first flew on January 25, 2020, with deliveries initially forecast for 2022 or 2023 and later delayed to 2025.

==Design==
Boeing introduced a number of advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital fly-by-wire controls, fully software-configurable avionics, Honeywell LCD glass cockpit flight displays, and the first use of a fiber optic avionics network on a commercial airliner. Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled Boeing 7J7 regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit electronic flight bag computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.

===Fly-by-wire===
In designing the 777 as its first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.

===Airframe and systems===


The airframe incorporates the use of composite materials, accounting for nine percent of the original structural weight, while the third-generation models, the 777-8 and 777-9, feature more composite parts. Composite components include the cabin floor and rudder, with the 777 being the first Boeing airliner to use composite materials for both the horizontal and vertical stabilizers (empennage). The main fuselage cross-section is fully circular, and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit.

The wings on the 777 feature a supercritical airfoil design that is swept back at 31.6 degrees and optimized for cruising at Mach 0.83 (revised after flight tests up to Mach 0.84). The wings are designed with increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners, resulting in greater payload and range, improved takeoff performance, and a higher cruising altitude. The wings also serve as fuel storage, with longer-range models able to carry up to of fuel. This capacity allows the 777-200LR to operate ultra-long-distance, trans-polar routes such as Toronto to Hong Kong. In 2013, a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777X, with a wider span and design features based on the 787&#x27;s wings.

Folding wingtips, long, were offered when the 777 was first launched, to appeal to airlines who might use gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft, but no airline purchased this option. Folding wingtips reemerged as a design feature at the announcement of the upgraded 777X in 2013. Smaller folding wingtips of in length will allow 777X models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s. These smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s, and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights.

The aircraft features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft&#x27;s braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine—a small retractable device which can provide emergency power—is also fitted in the wing root fairing.

===Interior===

The original 777 interior, also known as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger overhead bins, and indirect lighting. Seating options range from four to six–abreast in first class up to ten–abreast in economy. The 777&#x27;s windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure for all models outside the 777-8 and -9. The cabin also features &quot;Flexibility Zones&quot;, which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, pneumatic, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, galleys, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements. Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non-airline use. Boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly.

In February 2003, Boeing introduced overhead crew rests as an option on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.

In July 2011, &quot;Flight International&quot; reported that Boeing was considering replacing the Signature Interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787, as part of a move towards a &quot;common cabin experience&quot; across all Boeing platforms. With the launch of the 777X in 2013, Boeing confirmed that the aircraft would be receiving a new interior featuring 787 cabin elements and larger windows. Further details released in 2014 included re-sculpted cabin sidewalls for greater interior room, noise-damping technology, and higher cabin humidity.

Air France has a 777-300ER sub-fleet with 472 seats each, more than any other international 777, to achieve a cost per available seat kilometer (CASK) around €.05, similar to Level&#x27;s 314-seat Airbus A330-200, its benchmark for low-cost, long-haul. Competing on similar French overseas departments destinations, Air Caraïbes has 389 seats on the A350-900 and 429 on the -1000. French Bee&#x27;s is even more dense with its 411 seats A350-900, due to 10-abreast economy seating, reaching a €.04 CASK according to Air France, and lower again with its 480 seats on the -1000.

===Engines===
The initial 777 models (consisting of the 777-200, 777-200ER, 777-300) were launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers, GE Aviation, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Rolls-Royce, giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms. Each manufacturer agreed to develop an engine in the of thrust class for the world&#x27;s largest twinjet, resulting in the General Electric GE90, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. The Trent 800 is the lightest of the three powerplants as it weighs 13,400 lb (6.078 t) dry, while the GE90 is , and the PW4000 is .

For Boeing&#x27;s second-generation 777 variants (777-300ER, 777-200LR, and 777F) greater thrust was needed to meet the aircraft requirements, and GE was selected as the exclusive engine manufacturer. The higher-thrust variants, GE90-110B1 and -115B, have a different architecture from that of the earlier GE90 versions. GE incorporated an advanced larger diameter fan made from composite materials which enhanced thrust at low flight speeds. However, GE also needed to increase core power to improve net thrust at high flight speeds. Consequently, GE elected to increase core capacity, which they achieved by removing one stage from the rear of the HP compressor and adding an additional stage to the LP compressor, which more than compensated for the reduction in HP compressor pressure ratio, resulting in a net increase in core mass flow. The higher-thrust GE90 variants are the first production engines to feature swept rotor blades. The nacelle has a maximum diameter of . Each of the 22 fan blades on the GE90-115B have a length of and a mass of less than .

==Variants==
Boeing uses two characteristics – fuselage length and range – to define its 777 models. Passengers and cargo capacity varies by fuselage length: the 777-300 has a stretched fuselage compared to the base 777-200. Three range categories were defined: the A-market would cover domestic and regional operations, the B-market would cover routes from Europe to the US West coast and the C-market the longest transpacific routes. The A-market would be covered by a (7,800 km; ) range, MTOW aircraft for 353 to 374 passengers powered by engines, followed by a (12,200 km; ) B-market range for 286 passengers in three-class, with unit thrust and of MTOW, an A340 competitor, basis of an A-market 409 to 434 passengers stretch, and eventually a (14,000 km; ) C-market with engines.

When referring to different variants, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code collapses the 777 model designator and the -200 or -300 variant designator to &quot;772&quot; or &quot;773&quot;. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aircraft type designator system adds a preceding manufacturer letter, in this case &quot;B&quot; for Boeing, hence &quot;B772&quot; or &quot;B773&quot;. Designations may append a range identifier like &quot;B77W&quot; for the 777-300ER by the ICAO, &quot;77W&quot; for the IATA, though the -200ER is a company marketing designation and not certificated as such. Other notations include &quot;773ER&quot; and &quot;773B&quot; for the -300ER.

===777-200===
The initial 777-200 made its maiden flight on June 12, 1994, and was first delivered to United Airlines on May 15, 1995. With a 545,000 lb (247 t) MTOW and engines, it has a range of with 305 passenger seats in a three-class configuration. The -200 was primarily aimed at US domestic airlines, although several Asian carriers and British Airways have also operated the type. Nine different -200 customers have taken delivery of 88 aircraft, with 55 in airline service . The competing Airbus aircraft was the A330-300.

In March 2016, United Airlines shifted operations with all 19 of its -200s to exclusively domestic US routes, including flights to and from Hawaii, and added more economy class seats by shifting to a ten-abreast configuration (a pattern that matched American Airlines&#x27; reconfiguration of the type). , Boeing no longer markets the -200, as indicated by its removal from the manufacturer&#x27;s price listings for 777 variants.

====777-200ER====
The B-market 777-200ER (&quot;ER&quot; for Extended Range), originally known as the 777-200IGW (increased gross weight), has additional fuel capacity and an increased MTOW enabling transoceanic routes. With a 658,000 lb (298 t) MTOW and engines, it has a range with 301 passenger seats in a three-class configuration. It was delivered first to British Airways on February 6, 1997. Thirty-three customers received 422 deliveries, with no unfilled orders .

, 338 examples of the -200ER are in airline service. It competed with the A340-300. Boeing proposed the 787-10 to replace it. The value of a new -200ER rose from US$110 million at service entry to US$130 million in 2007; a 2007 model 777 was selling for US$30 million ten years later, while the oldest ones had a value around US$5–6 million, depending on the remaining engine time.

The engine can be delivered de-rated with reduced engine thrust for shorter routes to lower the MTOW, reduce purchase price and landing fees (as 777-200 specifications) but can be re-rated to full standard. Singapore Airlines ordered over half of its -200ERs de-rated.

====777-200LR Worldliner====
The 777-200LR Worldliner (&quot;LR&quot; for Long Range), the C-market model, entered service in 2006 as one of the longest-range commercial airliners. Boeing named it &quot;Worldliner&quot; as it can connect almost any two airports in the world, although it is still subject to ETOPS restrictions. It holds the world record for the longest nonstop flight by a commercial airliner. It has a maximum design range of . The -200LR was intended for ultra long-haul routes such as Los Angeles to Singapore.

Developed alongside the -300ER, the -200LR features an increased MTOW and three optional auxiliary fuel tanks in the rear cargo hold. Other new features include extended raked wingtips, redesigned main landing gear, and additional structural strengthening. As with the -300ER and 777F, the -200LR is equipped with wingtip extensions of 12.8 ft (3.90 m). The -200LR is powered by GE90-110B1 or GE90-115B turbofans. The first -200LR was delivered to Pakistan International Airlines on February 26, 2006. Twelve different -200LR customers took delivery of 61 aircraft. Airlines operated 50 of the -200LR variant . Emirates is the largest operator of the LR variant with 10 aircraft. The closest competing aircraft from Airbus are the discontinued A340-500HGW and the current A350-900ULR.

===777 Freighter===
The 777 Freighter (777F) is an all-cargo version of the twinjet, and shares features with the -200LR; these include its airframe, engines, and fuel capacity. The 777F is unofficially referred to as 777-200LRF by some cargo airlines. With a maximum payload of (similar to the of the Boeing 747-200F), it has a maximum range of 9,750 nmi (18,057 km; )) or 4,970 nmi (9,200 km; )) at its max structural payload.

The 777F also features a new supernumerary area, which includes four business-class seats forward of the rigid cargo barrier, full main deck access, bunks, and a galley. As the aircraft promises improved operating economics compared to older freighters, airlines have viewed the 777F as a replacement for freighters such as the Boeing 747-200F, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and McDonnell Douglas MD-11F.

The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19, 2009. , 247 freighters have been ordered by 25 different customers with 45 unfilled orders. Operators had 202 of the 777F in service .

===777-300===
Launched at the Paris Air Show on June 26, 1995, its major assembly started in March 1997 and its body was joined on July 21, it was rolled-out on September 8 and made its first flight on October 16. The 777-300 was designed to be stretched by 20%: 60 extra seats to 368 in a three-class configuration, 75 more to 451 in two classes, or up to 550 in all-economy like the 747SR. The stretch is done with in ten frames forward and in nine frames aft for a length, longer than the 747-400. It uses the -200ER fuel capacity and engines with a MTOW.

It has ground maneuvering cameras for taxiing and a tailskid to rotate, while the proposed MTOW -300X would have needed a semi-levered main gear. Its overwing fuselage section 44 was strengthened, with its skin thickness going from the -200&#x27;s , and received a new evacuation door pair. Its operating empty weight with Rolls-Royce engines in typical tri-class layout is compared to for a similarly configured -200. Boeing wanted to deliver 170 -300s by 2006 and to produce 28 per year by 2002, to replace early Boeing 747s, burning one-third less fuel with 40% lower maintenance costs.

With a 660,000 lb (299 t) MTOW and engines, it has a range of with 368 passengers in three-class. Eight different customers have taken delivery of 60 aircraft of the variant, of which 18 were powered by the PW4000 and 42 by the RR Trent 800 (none were ordered with the GE90, which was never certified on this variant), with 48 in airline service . The last -300 was delivered in 2006 while the longer-range -300ER started deliveries in 2004.

====777-300ER====
The 777-300ER (&quot;ER&quot; for Extended Range) is the B-market version of the -300. Its higher MTOW and increased fuel capacity permits a maximum range of with 392 passengers in a two-class seating arrangement. The 777-300ER features extended raked wingtips, a strengthened fuselage and wings and a modified main landing gear. Its wings have an aspect ratio of 9.0. It is powered by the GE90-115B turbofan, the world&#x27;s most powerful jet engine with a maximum thrust of .

Following flight testing, aerodynamic refinements have reduced fuel burn by an additional 1.4%. At , FL300, -59 °C and at a weight, it burns of fuel per hour. Its operating empty weight is . The projected operational empty weight is in airline configuration, at a weight of and FL350, total fuel flow is at , rising to at .

Since its launch, the -300ER has been a primary driver of the airplane&#x27;s sales past the rival A330/340 series. Its direct competitors have included the Airbus A340-600 and the A350-1000. Using two engines produces a typical operating cost advantage of around 8–9% for the -300ER over the A340-600. Several airlines have acquired the -300ER as a 747-400 replacement amid rising fuel prices given its 20% fuel burn advantage. The -300ER has an operating cost of $44 per seat hour, compared to an Airbus A380&#x27;s roughly $50 per seat hour and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 .

The first 777-300ER was delivered to Air France on April 29, 2004. The -300ER is the best-selling 777 variant, with Emirates being the largest operator with 123 777-300ER in service, having surpassed the -200ER in orders in 2010 and deliveries in 2013. , 784 300ERs were in service, A total of 831 were built with the last delivered to Aeroflot in 2021. Boeing ended 777-300ER production in 2024, and switched to the new 777X.

===777X===

The third-generation of the 777, launched as the 777X, is to feature new GE9X engines and new composite wings with folding wingtips. It was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9. The 777-8 provides seating for 395 passengers and has a range of , while the 777-9 has seating for 426 passengers and a range of over . A longer 777-10X, 777X Freighter, and 777X BBJ variants have also been proposed.

===Government and corporate===

Versions of the 777 have been acquired by government and private customers. The main purpose has been for VIP transport, including as an air transport for heads of state, although the aircraft has also been proposed for other military applications.
* 777 Business Jet (777 VIP) – the Boeing Business Jet version of the 777 that is sold to corporate customers. Boeing has received orders for 777 VIP aircraft based on the 777-200LR and 777-300ER passenger models. The aircraft are fitted with private jet cabins by third party contractors, and completion may take three years.
* KC-777 – this was a proposed tanker version of the 777. In September 2006, Boeing announced that it would produce the KC-777 if the United States Air Force (USAF) required a larger tanker than the KC-767, able to transport more cargo or personnel. In April 2007, Boeing offered its 767-based KC-767 Advanced Tanker instead of the KC-777 to replace the smaller Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker under the USAF&#x27;s KC-X program. Boeing officials have described the KC-777 as suitable for the related KC-Z program to replace the wide-body McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender.
* In 2014, the Japanese government chose to procure two 777-300ERs to serve as the official air transport for the Emperor of Japan and Prime Minister of Japan. The aircraft, operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force under the callsign Japanese Air Force One, entered service in 2019 and replaced two 747-400s - the 777-300ER was specifically selected by the Ministry of Defense owing to its similar capabilities to the preceding 747 pair. Besides VIP transport, the 777s are also intended for use in emergency relief missions.
* 777s are serving or have served as official government transports for nations including Gabon (VIP-configured 777-200ER), Turkmenistan (VIP-configured 777-200LR) and the United Arab Emirates (VIP-configured 777-200ER and 777-300ER operated by Abu Dhabi Amiri Flight). Prior to returning to power as Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafic Hariri acquired a 777-200ER as an official transport. The Indian government purchased two Air India 777-300ERs and converted them for VVIP transport operated by the Indian Air Force under the callsign Air India One; they entered service in 2021 replacing the Air India-owned 747s.
* In 2014, the USAF examined the possibility of adopting modified 777-300ERs or 777-9Xs to replace the Boeing 747-200 aircraft used as Air Force One. Although the USAF had preferred a four-engine aircraft, this was mainly due to precedent (existing aircraft were purchased when the 767 was just beginning to prove itself with ETOPS; decades later, the 777 and other twin jets established a comparable level of performance to quad-jet aircraft). Ultimately, the Air Force decided against the 777, and selected the Boeing 747-8 to become the next presidential aircraft.

===Aftermarket freighter conversions===
In the 2000s, Boeing began studying the conversion of 777-200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters, under the name 777 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter). The company has been in discussion with several airline customers, including FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, and GE Capital Aviation Services, to provide launch orders for a 777 BCF program.

====777-300ER Special Freighter (SF)====
In July 2018, Boeing was studying a 777-300ER freighter conversion, targeted for the volumetric market instead of the density market served by the production 777F. After having considered a -200ER P2F program, Boeing was hoping to conclude its study by the Fall as the 777X replacing aging -300ERs from 2020 will generate feedstock. New-build 777-300ERs may maintain the delivery rate at five per month, to bridge the production gap until the 777X is delivered. Within the 811 777-300ERs delivered and 33 to be delivered by October 2019, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) anticipates up to 150-175 orders through 2030, the four to five month conversion costing around $35 million.

In October 2019, Boeing and Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) launched the 777-300ERSF passenger to freighter conversion program with GECAS ordering 15 aircraft and 15 options, the first aftermarket 777 freighter conversion program. In June 2020, IAI received the first 777-300ER to be converted, from GECAS. In October 2020, GECAS announced the launch operator from 2023: Michigan-based Kalitta Air, already operating 24 747-400Fs, nine 767-300ERFs and three 777Fs. IAI should receive the first aircraft in December 2020 while certification and service entry was scheduled for late 2022. By March 2023, IAI had completed the first flight of a 777-300ER Special Freighter, converted for AerCap, as it had a backlog over 60 orders. 

The 777-300ER Special Freighter has a maximum payload of , a range of and shares the door aperture and aft position of the 777F. It has a cargo volume capacity of , 5,800 cu ft (164 m3) greater than the 777F (or % more) and can hold 47 standard 96 x 125 in pallet (P6P) positions, 10 more positions than a 777F or eight more than a 747-400F. With windows plugged, passenger doors deactivated, fuselage and floor reinforced, and a main-deck cargo door installed, the 777-300ERSF has 15% more volume than a 747-400BCF.

===Experimental===

Boeing has used 777 aircraft in two research and development programs. The first program, the Quiet Technology Demonstrator (QTD) was run in collaboration with Rolls-Royce and General Electric to develop and validate engine intake and exhaust modifications, including the chevrons subsequently used in the 737 MAX, 747-8 and 787 series. The tests were flown in 2001 and 2005.

A further program, the ecoDemonstrator series, is intended to test and develop technologies and techniques to reduce aviation&#x27;s environmental impact. The program started in 2011, with the first ecoDemonstrator aircraft flying in 2012. Various airframes have been used since to test a wide variety of technologies in collaboration with a range of industrial partners. 777s have been used on three occasions as of 2024. The first of these, a 777F in 2018, performed the world&#x27;s first commercial airliner flights using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2022-4, the testbed is a 777-200ER.

==Operators==

Boeing customers that have received the most 777s are Emirates, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, ILFC, and American Airlines. Emirates is the largest airline operator , and is the only customer to have operated all 777 variants produced, including the -200, -200ER, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F. The 1,000th 777 off the production line, a -300ER set to be Emirates&#x27; 102nd 777, was unveiled at a factory ceremony in March 2012.

A total of 1,416 aircraft (all variants) were in airline service , with Emirates (163), United Airlines (91), Air France (70), Cathay Pacific (69), American Airlines (67), Qatar Airways (67), British Airways (58), Korean Air (53), All Nippon Airways (50), Singapore Airlines (46), and other operators with fewer aircraft of the type. 

In 2017, 777 Classics are reaching the end of their mainline service: with a -200 age ranging from three to 22 years, 43 Classic 777s or 7.5% of the fleet have been retired. Values of 777-200ERs have declined by 45% since January 2014, faster than Airbus A330s and Boeing 767s with 30%, due to the lack of a major secondary market but only a few budget, air charters and ACMI operators. In 2015, Richard H. Anderson, then Delta Air Lines&#x27; chairman and chief executive, said he had been offered 777-200s for less than US$10 million. To keep them cost-efficient, operators densify their 777s for about US$10 million each, like Scoot with 402 seats in its dual-class -200s, or Cathay Pacific which switched the 3–3–3 economy layout of 777-300s to 3–4–3 to seat 396 on regional services.

===Orders and deliveries===

The 777 surpassed 2,000 orders by the end of 2018.
==Accidents and incidents==


, the 777 had been involved in 31 aviation accidents and incidents, including a total of eight hull losses (five in-flight accidents), resulting in 542 fatalities (including three fatalities due to ground casualties), along with three hijackings. The first fatality involving the twinjet occurred in a fire while an aircraft was being refueled at Denver International Airport in the United States on September 5, 2001, during which a ground worker sustained fatal burns. The aircraft, operated by British Airways, sustained fire damage to the lower wing panels and engine housing; it was later repaired and returned to service.

The first hull loss occurred on January 17, 2008, when a 777-200ER with Rolls-Royce Trent 895 engines, flying from Beijing to London as British Airways Flight 38, crash-landed approximately short of Heathrow Airport&#x27;s runway 27L and slid onto the runway&#x27;s threshold. There were 47 injuries and no fatalities. The impact severely damaged the landing gear, wing roots and engines. The accident was attributed to ice crystals suspended in the aircraft&#x27;s fuel clogging the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE). Two other minor momentary losses of thrust with Trent 895 engines occurred later in 2008. Investigators found these were also caused by ice in the fuel clogging the FOHE. As a result, the heat exchanger was redesigned.

The second hull loss occurred on July 29, 2011, when a 777-200ER scheduled to operate as EgyptAir Flight 667 suffered a cockpit fire while parked at the gate at Cairo International Airport before its departure. The aircraft was evacuated with no injuries, and airport fire teams extinguished the fire. The aircraft sustained structural, heat and smoke damage, and was written off. Investigators focused on a possible short circuit between an electrical cable and a supply hose in the cockpit crew oxygen system.

The third hull loss occurred on July 6, 2013, when a 777-200ER, operating as Asiana Airlines Flight 214, crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport after touching down short of the runway. The 307 surviving passengers and crew on board evacuated before fire destroyed the aircraft. Two passengers, who had not been wearing their seatbelts, were ejected from the aircraft during the crash and were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTSB/AAR-14/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A third passenger died six days later as a result of injuries sustained during the crash. These were the first fatalities in a crash involving a 777 since its entry into service in 1995. The official accident investigation concluded in June 2014 that the pilots committed 20 to 30 minor to significant errors in their final approach. Deficiencies in Asiana Airlines&#x27; pilot training and in Boeing&#x27;s documentation of complex flight control systems were also cited as contributory factors.

The fourth hull loss occurred on March 8, 2014, when a 777-200ER carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, was reported missing. Air Traffic Control&#x27;s last reported coordinates for the aircraft were over the South China Sea. After the search for the aircraft began, Malaysia&#x27;s prime minister, Najib Razak, announced on March 24, 2014, that after analysis of new satellite data it was now to be assumed &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that the aircraft had crashed in the Indian Ocean and there were no survivors. The cause remains unknown, but the Malaysian Government in January 2015, declared it an accident. US officials believe the most likely explanation to be that someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re-programmed the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot to travel south across the Indian Ocean. On July 29, 2015, an item later identified as a flaperon from the still missing aircraft was found on the island of Réunion in the western Indian Ocean, consistent with having drifted from the main search area.

The fifth hull loss occurred on July 17, 2014, when a 777-200ER, bound for Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam as Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 298 people (283 passengers and 15 crew) on board were killed, making this the deadliest crash involving the Boeing 777. The incident was linked to the ongoing War in Donbas. On the basis of the Dutch Safety Board and the Joint Investigation Team official conclusions of May 2018, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk missile system used in shooting down the airliner from territory held by pro-Russian separatists.

The sixth hull loss occurred on August 3, 2016, when a 777-300 crashed while landing and caught fire at Dubai Airport at the end of its flight as Emirates Flight 521. The preliminary investigation indicated that the aircraft was attempting a landing during active wind shear conditions. The pilots initiated a go-around procedure shortly after the wheels touched-down onto the runway; however, the aircraft settled back onto the ground, apparently due to late throttle application. As the undercarriage was in the process of being retracted, the aircraft landed on its rear underbody and engine nacelles, resulting in the separation of one engine, loss of control and subsequent crash. There were no passenger casualties of the 300 people on board, but one airport fireman was killed fighting the fire. The aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and right wing were irreparably damaged by the fire.

The seventh hull loss occurred on November 29, 2017, when a Singapore Airlines 777-200ER experienced a fire while being towed at Singapore Changi Airport. An aircraft technician was the only occupant on board and evacuated safely. The aircraft sustained heat damage and was written off. Another fire occurred on July 22, 2020 to an Ethiopian Airlines 777F while at the cargo area of Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The aircraft sustained heat damage and was written off as the eighth hull loss. Media reports on legal proceedings attribute the fire to the ignition of chlorine dioxide disinfection tablets at high temperatures in a humid environment on ground.

On February 20, 2021, a 777-200 operating as United Airlines Flight 328 suffered a failure of its starboard engine. The cowling and other engine parts fell over a Denver suburb. The captain declared an emergency and returned to land at the Denver airport. An immediate examination, before any formal investigation, found that two fan blades had broken off. One blade had suffered metal fatigue and may have chipped another blade, which also broke off. Boeing recommended suspending flights of all 128 operational 777s equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines until they had been inspected. Several countries also restricted flights of PW4000-equipped 777s in their territory. In 2018, a similar issue occurred on United Airlines Flight 1175 from San Francisco to Hawaii involving another 777-200 equipped with the same engine type.

On May 21, 2024, Singapore Airlines Flight 321, operated by a 777-300ER, encountered severe turbulence over Myanmar that injured 104 passengers and crew and led to the death of a passenger, who died of a suspected heart attack. 

==Aircraft on display==
* The first prototype, a Boeing 777-200, B-HNL (ex. N7771), was built in 1994 and originally used by Boeing for flight testing and development. In 2000, it was sold to Cathay Pacific (as no delivery slots were available for newly-built 777s) and refurbished for passenger service. After 18 years of commercial service, B-HNL was retired in mid-2018 amid press reports that it was to be displayed at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. On September 18, 2018, Cathay Pacific and Boeing announced that B-HNL would be donated to the Pima Air &amp; Space Museum near Tucson, Arizona, where it would be placed on permanent display.
* Three retired Saudia 777-200ER aircraft, formerly registered HZ-AKG, HZ-AKK, and HZ-AKP, respectively, were transported by road from Jeddah to Riyadh in September 2024 to be displayed at the Riyadh Season exhibition. The fuselage of each aircraft was to be used as a tourist attraction featuring aviation-themed exhibits and/or dining and retail options.

<text>Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg (, ; born 18 October 1960), known professionally as Jean-Claude Van Damme (, ), is a Belgian martial artist and actor. Born and raised in Brussels, his father enrolled him in a Shotokan karate school at the age of ten, which led Van Damme to hold the rank of 2nd-dan black belt in karate, and compete in several karate and kickboxing competitions. As a teenager, he won the middleweight championship of the European Professional Karate Association in 1979 and the Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in 1978. With the desire of becoming an actor in Hollywood, he moved to the United States in 1982, where he worked on several films, until he got his break as the lead in the martial arts film &quot;Bloodsport&quot; (1988).

He became a popular action film star and followed up with commercially successful films such as &quot;Cyborg&quot;, &quot;Kickboxer&quot; (both 1989), &quot;Lionheart&quot;, &quot;Death Warrant&quot; (both 1990), &quot;Double Impact&quot; (1991), &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (1992), &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;, &quot;Hard Target&quot; (both 1993), &quot;Timecop&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (both 1994), &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (1995), &quot;The Quest&quot;, which marked his directorial debut, and &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; (both 1996). He achieved sex symbol status in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1993 and 1998, three Hong Kong filmmakers collaborated with Van Damme for their debuts in Western cinema: John Woo, Tsui Hark, and Ringo Lam. After a decline in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, he returned to prominence with the critically acclaimed crime drama &quot;JCVD&quot; (2008), in which he starred as a fictional version of himself. His big return to the action genre was in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; (2012), in which he starred as the villain, opposite Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s character.

From thereon, he continued starring in action films and doing extensive voice work, appearing in the well-received &quot;Enemies Closer&quot; (2013), &quot;The Bouncer&quot;, &quot;&quot; (both 2018), &quot;&quot; (2022), and &quot;Darkness of Man&quot; (2024), among others. In television, he starred in the Ridley Scott-produced &quot;Jean-Claude Van Johnson&quot; (2016–2017). Regarded as an icon of action and martial arts cinema, his films have grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making him one of the most successful action stars of all time. Outside his film career, Van Damme has publicly supported various conservationist causes and animal rights organisations.

==Early life and education==
Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg, on 18 October 1960, in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, the son of Eliana and Eugène Van Varenberg, who was an accountant and florist. His father is from Brussels and bilingual, and his mother is Flemish (Dutch-speaking). Van Damme was brought up Roman Catholic. His paternal grandmother was Jewish.

He began martial arts at the age of ten, enrolled by his father in a Shōtōkan karate school. His styles consist of Shōtōkan Karate and Kickboxing. He eventually earned his black belt in karate at 18, and earned the rank of 2nd-dan black belt. He started lifting weights to improve his physique, which eventually led to a Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in 1978. At the age of 16, he took up ballet, which he studied for five years. According to Van Damme, ballet &quot;is an art, but it&#x27;s also one of the most difficult sports. If you can survive a ballet workout, you can survive a workout in any other sport.&quot; Later he took up both Taekwondo and Muay Thai.

Among his acting heroes growing up were Charles Bronson, Bruce Lee, James Dean, Montgomery Clift, Steve McQueen, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Sylvester Stallone.

== Career ==

=== Early 1970s to 1980: Martial arts and first film appearance ===

At the age of 12, Van Damme joined the &quot;Centre National de Karaté&quot; (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Claude Goetz in Belgium. Van Damme trained for four years and he earned a spot on the Belgian Karate Team; he later trained in full-contact karate and kickboxing with Dominique Valera. According to Van Damme, &quot;it was tough growing up. I was kind of geeky, and physically I was not gifted&quot;.

At the age of 15, he started his competitive karate career in Belgium. From 1976 to 1980, he compiled a record of 44 victories and four defeats in tournament and non-tournament semi-contact matches.

He was a member of the Belgium Karate Team when it won the European Karate Championship on 26 December 1979 at La Coupe François Persoons Karate Tournament in Brussels.

He placed second at the Challenge Coupe des Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st Trials). At the three-day tournament, he defeated 25 opponents before losing in the finals to teammate Angelo Spataro.

On 8 March 1980, in Brussels, Belgium, he competed against his former teammate Patrick Teugels at the Forest National Arena on the undercard of the Dan Macaruso-Dominique Valera Professional Karate Association Light-Heavyweight World Championship bout. Prior to this match, Teugels had defeated Van Damme twice by decision, including a match for the Belgium Lightweight Championship. Van Damme had a 1977 victory over Teugels. Teugels was coming off an impressive showing at the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations World Championships four months earlier, and was favored by some to win this match. According to reports, and Patrick Teugels&#x27; own interview (with photos), Teugels lost to Van Damme by TKO in the 1st round. Teugels was kicked in the nose and was unable to continue as a result. In a 2013 interview, Van Damme called this fight his most memorable match.

He began his full-contact career in 1977, when Claude Goetz promoted the first ever full-contact karate tournament in Belgium.

From 1977 to 1982, he compiled a record of 18 victories (18 knockouts) and one defeat. 

In 1979, he had an uncredited role in André Delvaux&#x27;s &quot;Woman Between Wolf and Dog&quot;, a Belgian-French drama film starring Marie-Christine Barrault, and Rutger Hauer.

In 1980, he caught the attention of &quot;Professional Karate Magazine&quot; publisher and editor Mike Anderson and multiple European champion Geert Lemmens. Both men tabbed Van Damme as an upcoming prospect. Van Damme retired from competition in 1982.

During his early life, he sold flowers in restaurants, and got a loan to open a gym to save some money before his move to the United States. Aptly titled &quot;California Gym&quot;, it was opened in 1979 and catered to &quot;karate, dancing, aerobics, bodybuilding – everything&quot;. Van Damme adds that &quot;I wrote special training programs for people, and it was a very upbeat atmosphere with music&quot;. At its peak, &quot;California Gym&quot; was making $15,000 per month; &quot;when I decided to sell my gym my father thought I was crazy. He said, &#x27;What the hell are you doing? You have the best gym in Brussels. You have a sports car, a beautiful apartment, you&#x27;re making so much money that you can have anything you want — and now you&#x27;re going to sell your business and go to America&#x27;. He was very upset&quot;.

=== 1982 to 1988: Early works and breakthrough ===
In 1982, he and childhood friend Michel Qissi moved to the United States in the hope of working as actors. They did a variety of jobs to support themselves. Their first job working on a film as extras in the hip hop dance film &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot; (1984), made by Cannon Films; they are seen dancing in the background at a dance demonstration.

Around that time he developed a friendship with action martial art film star Chuck Norris. They started sparring together, and Van Damme started to work as a bouncer at a bar named Woody&#x27;s Wharf, owned by Norris. He also supplemented his income as a limousine driver and private karate instructor.

He described his early days in the United States as being particularly difficult – excluding $2,000, he had placed all of his money from the sale of his gym into a European bank; thus, he struggled financially. To ensure his own emotional wellbeing, he would go for runs every night in Santa Monica. After that, he would train at the world-renowned Gold&#x27;s Gym. This routine reportedly helped him survive for many years. He actively participated in casting calls and had a specific routine. On Wednesdays, he would purchase the Drama-Logue magazine; then Thursday mornings, he would send out his picture and resume in response to advertisements. He was willing to try anything to achieve success, even going so far as to fabricate a story. He would call movie studios and claim to be an actor from Brussels with an investor from Hong Kong. He also instructed a friend to play along and act as if they wanted him to star in a movie and were willing to invest money, but required additional funding. Armed with this, he approached producers and suddenly found that all his phone calls were being answered. Of course, his intention was simply to meet the person and put his name out there, as opposed to securing illegitimate deals.

In the 1984 action film &quot;Missing in Action&quot; starring Norris, which was also released by Cannon Films, Van Damme is credited in the stunt team crew. That same year he also had a role in the comedy short film &quot;Monaco Forever.&quot;

Corey Yuen&#x27;s martial arts film &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender,&quot; which premiered On 2 May 1986 in Los Angeles, was his first sizeable role when he was cast as the Russian villain. It starred Kurt McKinney, and was released through New World Pictures. McKinney stars as Jason Stillwell, a U.S. teenager who learns karate and defends his martial arts dojo against a Soviet martial artist played by Van Damme. Both Vann Damme and McKinney were set to also star in &quot;No Retreat, No Surrender 2,&quot; but backed out.

He worked for director John McTiernan for the film &quot;Predator&quot; (1987) as an early (eventually abandoned) version of the titular alien, before being removed and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall. As the first choice to play the titular Predator character, with the intent that he would use his martial arts skills to make the alien an agile, ninja-like hunter, but after few days shot, he left the film. It was reported that he constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot and causing him to pass out; he allegedly also voiced reservations about only appearing on camera in the suit. Additionally, it became apparent that a more physically imposing actor was needed to make the creature appear threatening against the team of soldiers. The role eventually went to Kevin Peter Hall. After &quot;Predator&quot; was a success, Van Damme said that he appreciated the movie and that he had no regrets about missing that role.

Van Damme&#x27;s breakout film was &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, which opened on 26 February 1988, based on the alleged true story of Frank Dux. It was shot on a $1.5-million budget for Cannon. The film is about U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux (played by Van Damme), trained from his youth in the ways of ninjutsu by Senzo Tanaka, who takes the place of Tanaka&#x27;s deceased son Shingo in the illegal martial-arts tournament Kumite in Hong Kong. It became a U.S. box-office hit in the spring of 1988. Producer Mark Di Salle said he was looking for &quot;a new martial arts star who was a ladies&#x27; man, [but Van Damme] appeals to both men and women. He&#x27;s an American hero who fights for justice the American way and kicks the stuffing out of the bad guys.&quot; In reality, Van Damme had begged for a starring role; at the point of casting, he was homeless, sleeping in cars and garages, and sometimes had to resort to stealing food to survive. Also in 1988, he played another Russian villain in &quot;Black Eagle&quot;, opposite Sho Kosugi.

=== 1989 to 1999: International stardom ===
After the success of &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, Cannon Films offered him the lead in &quot;Delta Force 2&quot;, &quot;American Ninja 3&quot; or &quot;Cyborg&quot;, a cyberpunk martial arts film directed by Albert Pyun. He chose &quot;Cyborg&quot; which premiered in 1989. The film was a low budget box office success and led to two sequels, neither of which Van Damme appeared in.

Cannon used Van Damme again in &quot;Kickboxer&quot; released that same year. It was highly successful, returning over $50 million on a $3-million budget. The film started the &quot;Kickboxer&quot; franchise. He did not appear in any of the film&#x27;s four sequels, though he did return as a different character in the reboot series.

In 1990, he starred in &quot;Death Warrant&quot;, the first script credit for David S. Goyer. Also that year he starred in &quot;Lionheart&quot;. &quot;Lionheart&quot; was directed by Sheldon Lettich who had co-written &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, and said the film was &quot;the first movie to demonstrate that Van Damme was more than just a flash-in-the-pan &quot;Karate Guy&quot; who would never rise above simplistic low-budget karate movies.&quot; It also featured rear nudity from Van Damme which Lettich says &quot;became a very memorable moment for the ladies in the audience, and for the gay guys as well. Showing off his butt (clothed or unclothed) almost became a signature trademark of his after that.&quot;

In 1991, &quot;Double Impact&quot; was released. Directed by Lettich, it features Van Damme in the dual role of Alex and Chad Wagner, estranged twin brothers fighting to avenge the deaths of their parents. Upon its opening it received mixed reviews. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film &quot;delivers the goods&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; didn&#x27;t like the plotline and predicted a flop. The film grossed $23,683,813 in its first 28 days. It made a total of $30,102,717 in the US. Retrospective critics perceive it to be a fun action film, with good comical moments, and a good performance by Van Damme who plays two distinct characters.

In 1992, he starred in one of the biggest blockbusters of the year in the sci-fi action picture, &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;, directed by Roland Emmerich for Carolco. Van Damme (as Luc Deveraux) and Dolph Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) play U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War who end up shooting each other dead after Devereaux discovers that Scott has gone insane and resorted to mutilating civilians. They are later reanimated in a secret Army project along with a large group of other previously dead soldiers and sent on a mission. At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical when both men pushed each other only to be separated, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt. &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; opened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65 million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102 million worldwide, on a $23 million budget.

He was considered to play Simon Phoenix in &quot;Demolition Man&quot; and was briefly considered for the role of Michael Cheritto in &quot;Heat&quot;. 

In 1993, he made a cameo in &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, and starred in &quot;Nowhere To Run&quot;. The film was the first in a three-picture deal between Van Damme and Columbia Pictures and his fee was $3.5 million. Columbia said the film is &quot;true to his audience and goes beyond his audience.&quot;

In 1994, he starred in &quot;Hard Target&quot; for Universal Pictures, the first American film from director John Woo. Also released that year, he starred in &quot;Timecop&quot;, playing a time-traveling cop. Directed by Peter Hyams, the film was a huge success, grossing over $100 million worldwide, and remains his highest-grossing film in a lead role to date. Also that year, he starred in &quot;Street Fighter,&quot; written and directed by Steven E. de Souza for Universal and based on the video game. It was poorly received critically. Though a commercial success, making approximately three times its production cost.

Van Damme and Hyams re-teamed for Universal&#x27;s &quot;Sudden Death&quot;, released in 1995. Van Damme portrays a French Canadian-born firefighter with the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau who suffered a personal crisis after he was unable to save a young girl from a house fire. Now removed from active duty, he has become demoted to being fire marshal for the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, where a gang of terrorists are holding U.S. Vice President and several other VIPs hostage in a luxury suite during a game. The movie was a modest success.

In 1996, he starred and directed &quot;The Quest&quot;. The film, though it under-performed domestically, did better internationally at the box-office and was a commercial success. That year, he appeared in the TV show &quot;Friends&quot; in the two-part episode &quot;The One After the Superbowl&quot;. He also starred in &quot;Maximum Risk&quot;, the first American film directed by Ringo Lam, and their first collaboration. The film was mildly successful at the box office.

He followed up with &quot;Double Team&quot; (1997), a sci fi action film with basketball superstar Dennis Rodman. It was Hong Kong director Tsui Hark&#x27;s American debut.

In 1998, he and Hark reunited on &quot;Knock Off,&quot; a box-office flop. Also that year, Van Damme acted in the war film &quot;Legionnaire&quot;. Despite a $35 million budget, it was not released theatrically in the US, only overseas.

In 1999, he starred in &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot;, (1999), where he returns as Luc Deveraux. The movie did poorly at the box office debuting at #4, which proved to be his last theatrical release until &quot;JCVD&quot; in 2008. That year he also starred in &quot;Inferno (1999).&quot;

=== 2000 to 2007: Switch to direct-to-video ===

Released in 2001, &quot;Replicant&quot; is the second collaboration between Van Damme and director Ringo Lam, and the fifth time that Van Damme has starred in a dual role. It co-stars Michael Rooker. Also that year he starred in &quot;The Order&quot;, directed by Sheldon Lettich, and written by Van Damme.

In 2002, he starred in &quot;Derailed.&quot; &quot;In Hell&quot; is a 2003 American prison action film directed by Ringo Lam. It is the third collaboration between Van Damme and Lam. Van Damme plays an American working overseas in Magnitogorsk, Russia. That same year, he employed his dancing training in the music video for Bob Sinclar&#x27;s &quot;Kiss My Eyes&quot;.

His 2004 film was &quot;Wake of Death,&quot; an action film directed by Philippe Martinez. Ringo Lam was the original director, but he left the project after a few weeks of filming in Canada. It co-stars Simon Yam, Valerie Tian, Tony Schiena, etc.

In 2005, he played himself in the French film &quot;Narco.&quot; In 2006, he starred in &quot;Second in Command&quot; directed by Simon Fellows, and &quot;The Hard Corps&quot; directed by Sheldon Lettich.

In 2007, he played a small role in &quot;The Exam&quot;, a Turkish comedy-drama film directed by Ömer Faruk Sorak. Also that year he starred in &quot;Until Death&quot;.

=== 2008 to 2013: Return to mainstream ===
Van Damme returned to the mainstream with the limited theatrical release of the 2008 film &quot;JCVD&quot;, which received positive reviews. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; named his performance in the film the second best of the year (after Heath Ledger&#x27;s The Joker in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;), having previously stated that Van Damme &quot;deserves not a black belt, but an Oscar.&quot; Also in 2008, he starred in Isaac Florentine&#x27;s &quot;The Shepherd: Border Patrol.&quot;

He then reprised his role as Luc Deveraux alongside Dolph Lundgren in the 2009 film &quot;Universal Soldier: Regeneration&quot;, directed by John Hyams. The film was released theatrically in the Middle East and Southeast Asia and directly to video in the United States and other parts of the world. Since its release, the film has received mostly positive reviews, with praise towards the performances and surprisingly high production values.

In 2010, he directed himself in the barely released &quot;Full Love.&quot; That same year, he turned down the role of Gunner Jensen in the first instalment of &quot;The Expendables&quot; and the role went to Dolph Lundgren.

In 2011, he voiced Master Croc in the computer animation film &quot;Kung Fu Panda 2&quot;. In the film, he voices a character who helps the heroes of the previous film. That same year, he co-starred with Scott Adkins in &quot;Assassination Games&quot;. Also in 2011, he played a role in the French comedy &quot;Beur sur la ville.&quot; Also that year, he starred in his own reality TV show &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;. The show showcases his family life, his personal troubles, and an upcoming fight. Since 2009, he has been planning to make a comeback to fight former boxing Olympic gold-medalist Somluck Kamsing. The fight was a focal point in his ITV reality show &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot;. The fight has been repeatedly postponed, with many critics doubting it will occur, especially due to the difficulty of booking the venue.

In 2012, he acted in the Russian comedy film named &quot;Rzhevsky Versus Napoleon,&quot; and &quot;U.F.O.&quot; He starred in &quot;Dragon Eyes&quot;, &quot;Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning&quot;, and &quot;Six Bullets&quot;.

Also that year, he starred as the main villain in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot;. The film series follows a mercenary group as they undertake a mission which evolves into a quest for revenge against a rival mercenary (Van Damme). The film was a success, grossing over $310 million worldwide, and was his big return to the action genre. &quot;Empire&quot;″s Nick de Semlyen praised Van Damme&#x27;s &quot;grandstanding, plutonium-crazed baddie&quot; and Lundgren&#x27;s &quot;action-troll&quot; as high points in the film. Also that year, he was seen as part of Kam Sing&#x27;s ring crew when Kam Sing fought against Jomhod Kiatadisak. He also appeared in commercials for Coors Light beer, showing him on a snow-covered mountain wearing a sleeveless denim jacket, and for the washing powder Dash. On 21 October 2012, he was honored with a life-size statue of himself in his hometown of Brussels. He told reporters during the unveiling, &quot;Belgium is paying me back something, but really it&#x27;s to pay back to the dream. So when people come by here, it is not Jean-Claude van Damme but it&#x27;s a guy from the street who believed in something. I want the statue to represent that&quot;.

In 2013, he acted in the comedy &quot;Welcome to the Jungle.&quot; Also that year&quot;,&quot; he played the main villain in &quot;Enemies Closer,&quot; an American action thriller film directed by Peter Hyams. On 13 November 2013, Volvo Trucks released an advertisement on YouTube that shows Van Damme doing the splits while perched with each of his feet on the outer rearview mirrors of one semi-trailer truck and one box truck moving backwards, which he describes in the commercial as &quot;the most epic of splits&quot;. The video quickly went viral around the web, receiving more than 11 million views in three days, 35 million in the first week. It was dubbed as &quot;The Epic Split&quot;.

=== 2014–present: Subsequent films ===
&quot;Swelter&quot; is a 2014 American action film where he plays one of the leads. It stars Lennie James, and co-stars Grant Bowler, Josh Henderson, and Alfred Molina. James plays a sheriff in a small town who has a dark past that he can not remember, only to have to confront it when his ex-partners show up looking for stolen money they believe he has.

In 2015, he starred in the action thriller film &quot;Pound of Flesh,&quot; directed by Ernie Barbarash. Also that year, he had a supporting role in a Chinese superhero parody film.

In 2016, he returned to his voice role of Master Croc in the &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; franchise for the third installment. Also that year, he acted in &quot;&quot; directed by John Stockwell. It is a reboot of the original where he was the lead. That year he also played the lead in the TV series &quot;Jean-Claude Van Johnson&quot;.

In 2017, he starred in &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, an action film directed by Peter Malota.

In 2018, he returned to his role in &quot;,&quot; a sequel to the reboot. That same year, he acted in &quot;Black Water&quot;. It co-stars Dolph Lundgren in the fifth collaboration between both actors as well as the first time they appear together as on-screen allies. In 22 August of that same year, he starred in Julien Leclercq&#x27;s &quot;The Bouncer&quot;.

In 2019, he starred in &quot;We Die Young&quot;. In 2021, he starred in &quot;The Last Mercenary.&quot; In 2022, he voiced the character Jean-Clawed in the computer animation film &quot;&quot;.

In 2023, he featured his likeness and voice as Johnny Cage in the fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023). In 2024, he debuted in &quot;Hitman: World of Assassination&quot; as the game&#x27;s latest &quot;elusive target&quot;. The game features Van Damme in the role of Max Valliant, a former ICA agent who avoided a previous assassination attempt several years prior.

==Monuments==

In 2012, a statue of Van Damme was unveiled in Anderlecht, Belgium. The artwork, which depicts a younger incarnation of &quot;the Muscles from Brussels&quot; in one of his fighting poses from the movie &quot;Kickboxer&quot;, was commissioned to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Westland Shopping complex. The unveiling took place on Boulevard Sylvain Dupuis and was attended by Van Damme, his parents, Wallonia-Brussels culture minister and nearly 2,000 fans. Van Damme said the statue &quot;represented the dream of a Brussels kid&quot; and was &quot;for all the children who want something bad&quot;, adding that &quot;if you believe in something strongly enough, it can come true&quot;.

In 2019, a Van Damme monument was mounted in the Vandam village of Qabala, Azerbaijan, due to the similarity of the village name and Van Damme&#x27;s name. The actor subsequently published a post on his Facebook account, thanking those responsible.

==Controversies==

===Lawsuit and fight record controversy===
In 1997, Frank Dux, the martial artist whom Van Damme portrayed in &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, filed a lawsuit against him for $50,000 for co-writing and consultation work Dux did on the 1996 film &quot;The Quest&quot;. According to the lawsuit, Dux also accused him of lying to the public about his martial arts fight record, stating that when Dux tutored Van Damme while the latter was laying carpet for a living, Van Damme exhibited a lack of martial arts skills. Van Damme&#x27;s lawyer, Martin Singer, responded, &quot;There are records to document his martial arts acclaim. Why, just look at his movies; he didn&#x27;t get those roles on his acting ability! He&#x27;s the one who does those splits on chairs. He doesn&#x27;t have a stuntman to do that.&quot;

===Chuck Zito incident===
Tensions arose between Van Damme and bodyguard/stuntman Chuck Zito when Zito began dating Van Damme&#x27;s estranged wife Darcy LaPier. Zito was reportedly unhappy about LaPier&#x27;s claim in a divorce action that Van Damme had abused her. On 6 February 1998, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Van Damme had been punched by Zito the previous night at the Scores strip club in Manhattan, New York. Zito, who had previously bodyguarded Van Damme and did stunts on the film &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;, recalled the incident in his 2002 autobiography &quot;Street Justice&quot;, claiming that he suffered a broken hand as a result of striking Van Damme several times after Van Damme made disparaging remarks about him to a club bouncer, who then relayed the comments to Zito. Van Damme denied in an appearance on &quot;Inside Edition&quot; days after the incident that he had been struck by Zito and challenged Zito to a fight.

===Kadyrov event===
In October 2011, Van Damme, along with other celebrities including Hilary Swank, Vanessa-Mae and Seal attracted criticism from human rights groups for attending an event in Russian federal subject Chechnya&#x27;s capital Grozny on the 35th birthday of Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov on 5 October. Human rights groups, who had urged the celebrities to cancel their appearances because of abuses carried out under Kadyrov, criticised the celebrities for attending the event. Human Rights Watch released a statement which said, &quot;Ramzan Kadyrov is linked to a litany of horrific human rights abuses. It&#x27;s inappropriate for stars to get paid to party with him [...] And getting paid to be part of such a lavish show in Chechnya trivializes the suffering of countless victims of human rights abuses there.&quot;

==Public image and influence==

Van Damme is widely regarded as an icon of action and martial arts cinema. At the height of his career, he was one of the biggest action movie stars in the world, and one of the most successful martial arts actors of the 1980s and 1990s, alongside Steven Seagal. His popularity is credited with opening the Hollywood doors to names like Don Wilson, Olivier Gruner, Dale Cook and Loren Avedon. Described as the most &#x27;remade&#x27; action star, his films have spawned endless sequels, such as &quot;Bloodsport II: The Next Kumite&quot; (1996), &quot;Bloodsport III&quot; (1997), &quot;Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite&quot; (1999), &quot;Cyborg 2&quot; (1993), &quot;Cyborg 3: The Recycler&quot; (1994), Kickboxer 2–6 in the &quot;Kickboxer (film series)&quot;, &quot;Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms&quot; (1998), &quot;Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business&quot; (1998), &quot;Hard Target 2&quot; (2016), &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot; (2009), &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; (2014), &quot;Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision&quot; (2003), the &quot;Timecop (TV series)&quot; (1997), and &quot;Welcome to Sudden Death&quot; (2020). Van Damme&#x27;s influence has been compared to the Bruceploitation explosion of the 1970s.

Van Damme achieved sex symbol status through publicity venues in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Unlike his major rivals in action film, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Steven Seagal, and Bruce Willis, Van Damme was nominated by the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; as number one on their &quot;Top Ten Sexiest Men in the World&quot; list, being the only action film star listed.

Many martial artists, athletes, and filmmakers have cited Van Damme as an influence, such as Alain Moussi, Scott Adkins, Dave Callaham, Adam Brody, Jay Cutler, Lyoto Machida, Michael Page, Anderson Silva, Georges St-Pierre, Cain Velasquez, Nick Diaz, Nate Diaz, Conor McGregor, Jiří Procházka, Mirko Cro Cop, , Rico Verhoeven, Tom Duquesnoy, John Albert, Charles Rosa, Murad Ramazanov, Halil Amir, Andrei Stoica, Giorgio Petrosyan, Alfie Davis, Enkh-Orgil Baatarkhuu, and Angela Chang. In August 2016, Georges St-Pierre described fighting Van Damme in the film &quot;&quot; as &quot;a dream come true&quot;.

American professional wrestler Robert Alexander Szatkowski was given his ring name &quot;Rob Van Dam&quot; in 1992 by Ron Slinker, a promoter in Florida, possibly because of his martial arts experience and his resemblance to Van Damme.

The original video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992) was conceived as a fighting game based on Van Damme. Creators Ed Boon and John Tobias had originally wanted to star Van Damme himself in the game. That fell through as he had allegedly a prior deal for another game under the auspices of the Sega Genesis platform. Boon and Tobias eventually decided to create a character named Johnny Cage, who is modelled after Van Damme, primarily from Van Damme&#x27;s appearance and outfit in the martial arts film &quot;Bloodsport&quot;. In the German version of the Donkey Kong 64 website, DK&#x27;s greatest hero is Jean-Claude Van Kong.

In 2020, Van Damme was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
From 1993 to 1996, the stress of the constant filming and promotion of his films, as Van Damme claims, led him to develop a cocaine habit, on which he spent up to $10,000 a week, and consuming up to 10 grams per day by 1996. He was arrested for driving under the influence in 1999. Attempts at drug rehabilitation were unsuccessful, and he resorted to resolve his addiction via quitting cold turkey and exercise. In 1998, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 2011, he discussed the condition on the British reality show &quot;Jean-Claude Van Damme: Behind Closed Doors&quot;, saying, &quot;Sometimes you&#x27;re gonna like me, and sometimes you&#x27;re gonna hate me. But what can I do? I&#x27;m not perfect ... I&#x27;m an extreme bipolar, and I&#x27;m taking medication for this ... When I was young, I was suffering those swing moods. In the morning, the sky was blue [when I was] going to school, and to me, the sky was black. I was so sad.&quot;

He has been married five times to four different women. Until 1992 he was married to his third wife, bodybuilder Gladys Portugues, with whom he has two children, Kristopher (b. 1987) and Bianca Brigitte (b. 1990). He had begun an affair with actress Darcy LaPier, whom he married in February 1994. From this marriage, they have a son named Nicholas (b. 10 October 1995). That same year he had an affair with his &quot;Street Fighter&quot; co-star Kylie Minogue during filming in Thailand. LaPier, who was pregnant with their son at the time, did not become aware of the affair until Van Damme publicly admitted it in 2012.

In October 2016, he expressed his support for presidential candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election. Earlier that year in March, he mentioned that the Illuminati including the Rockefellers and Rothschilds might try to stop Trump from winning.

===Conservationism===
Outside acting, Van Damme has publicly supported various conservationist causes and animal rights organisations, appearing in a number of PSAs for Animals Australia, and working towards his goal of rallying celebrities and fellow actors in creating sanctuaries for endangered species. In 2022, he was appointed as Democratic Republic of the Congo Ambassador On Environment, with the role of enhancing the protection of forests as well as local fauna and flora.

<text>The Gravis PC GamePad is a game port game controller produced by Advanced Gravis Computer Technology first released in 1991. It was the first gamepad for the IBM PC compatible in a market then dominated by joysticks. Included with the gamepad was a shareware &quot;Commander Keen&quot; game, episode 1, &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot;, which was later replaced with the shareware episode 4, &quot;Secret of the Oracle&quot; which supported all 4 buttons. The gamepad is no longer manufactured, as Gravis was acquired in 1997 by Kensington Computer Products Group.

==Features==
The gamepad&#x27;s design is similar to that of the stock SNES controller (more so the Japanese and European version with colored buttons), although it lacks the Start, Select and shoulder buttons, and the shape of the controller&#x27;s chassis differs slightly, with an inverted curve on the left side. As originally found in some versions of the Master System controller, the center of the Gravis GamePad&#x27;s d-pad allows a small joystick to be inserted. The resulting lever action provides increased directional sensitivity, which may be preferred in fighting games.

Both at the top and bottom of the gamepad are switches. One of them removes the normal functionality from 2 of the buttons, and turns them into autofire variants of the first 2. This gave all four buttons functionality even in PC games that only supported two buttons on joysticks or for scenarios when two gamepads are connected with a Y-splitter. The other allows for left-handed operation by turning the workings of the D-pad and buttons upside down.

==Variations==
For PC, two followup variations were made, called the &quot;GamePad Pro&quot;, and &quot;GamePad Pro USB&quot;, which resemble the original PlayStation Controller, with the addition of four shoulder buttons, as well as Select and Start buttons. The GamePad Pro utilized the &#x27;button&#x27; signal lines on an analog PC joystick port to send digital signals (referred to as &quot;GrIP&quot;) to allow for both the use of ten buttons and the simultaneous use of up to four controllers connected by the controller&#x27;s built-in piggyback plug. A switch on the pack of the non-USB pad could be used to allow the pad to function as a standard analog four-button pad; otherwise, games could not detect the gamepad unless they were coded with the device in mind (DOS) or a specific driver was installed (Windows). The latter uses the USB port and the USB Human Interface Device class standards, and is not intended for DOS use. Gravis also launched other series of gamepads for the Mac, the Amiga, and Atari ST.

The Philips CD-i interactive multimedia CD player features a wired controller that is basically the original Gravis PC GamePad in a monochrome, grey color scheme. The Gravis logo is replaced with the Philips logo. There are only two button functions, and the switch at the bottom controls the cursor speed in menus.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;The Gravis Game Pad, one of the first and probably the best PC game pad, has enjoyed steady sales for several years.&quot;

== Media ==
 One icon from the Nuvola icon set resembles the GamePad.
The GamePad was also the official gamepad of &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, as noted in the shareware demo version of the game. The gamepad appears in the game as a power-up, and as an advertisement in the background, which reads &quot;All kids love Gravis GamePad&quot;.

<doc id="89271" wikidata="Q2127543" url="?curid=89271" title="Hired Guns">
<text>Hired Guns is a role-playing video game developed by DMA Design for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles and published by Psygnosis in 1993. In the year 2712, players control a team of four outlaw mercenaries, chosen from a pool of twelve, attempting to destroy illegal bio-engineered organisms using a thermonuclear explosion. The game shows four simultaneous first-person perspective viewpoints and allows up to four players to play together. Players must manage their characters&#x27; inventory and carrying capacity, and adapt to various environmental challenges like underwater areas.

The game&#x27;s release was delayed multiple times, leading to a running gag in British magazine &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. Upon release, &quot;Hired Guns&quot; received praise for its multiplayer mode, offering moments of surprise and satisfaction, but it faced criticism for its documentation, copy protection, and clumsy inventory management. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked Hired Guns 62nd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game uses a system of four simultaneous &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;-style first-person perspective viewpoints in the world. Each character is individually controllable and occupies their own square, unlike &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, in which the entire party occupies the same square. Each character can be made to follow another character, simplifying large group movements when only one player is controlling the party. The gameplay was advanced for its time, allowing up to four players to play simultaneously, using mouse, keyboard or (modified) Sega Mega Drive joypad, with a parallel port adaptor allowing four joypads/joysticks to be used at once.

The game area is in real 3D, and monster/enemy AI have free movement around each level environment. This is unlike other games of its time, in which enemies cannot pursue characters up stairs. An array of light and heavy weapons (including robot sentries), incendiary devices, mines and grenades can be used to take out the enemy (or friends) either on the same level as the player or below.

Players have to manage their inventory, too, as the combined weight of the items in a character&#x27;s inventory is limited by his/her/its carrying capacity. If this limit is exceeded the message &quot;Too heavy!&quot; will be displayed on the character&#x27;s viewpoint and he/she/it may not add anything more to the inventory until enough items have been discarded or consumed to bring the total weight below his/her/its carrying capacity again. There are no other penalties on movement or actions for carrying too heavy a load.

Different characters have different carrying capacities. E.g. a heavy combat droid can lug around more weight than a human female.

Also included are devices called &quot;Psionic Amps&quot; that can be used to create strange effects on the player or on the world around them — e.g. one type of Psionic Amp can be used underwater to create an area of air so human characters can breathe.

Underwater areas affect gameplay in two major ways: human characters will drown if they stay under for too long while weapons and equipment will take damage at varying rates until they are destroyed outright. Energy weapons are particularly susceptible to water damage and most types will be destroyed in mere seconds unless protected by a suitable psionic amp which must be activated before entering the water. Neither robotic nor human characters can swim, but are relegated to walking around on the bottom in the same manner as on land.

==Plot==
A team of outlaw mercenaries, led by the character Rorian are hired to destroy all of the illegally bio-engineered organisms on the planet Graveyard via means of a fusion induced thermonuclear explosion, which is to be achieved by collecting four fusion power core rings, and depositing them in the corresponding field coil generator located at Graveyard Central Spaceport. The secondary mission objective is to reconnoitre ground installations.

==Release==
British magazine &quot;Amiga Power&quot; (AP) had a long running gag about &quot;Hired Guns&quot;. It printed a thin strip on the back cover with a few lines about next month&#x27;s issue and a screenshot of an upcoming game. As the &quot;Hired Guns&quot; release was delayed, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; repeatedly used the same screenshot, with repeated reassurances that they might, possibly, have it by next month. When the game finally arrived, it remained in the Next Month strip along with text suggesting it was stuck there and nobody knew how to remove it.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1994 praised &quot;Hired Guns&quot;″s multiplayer mode when playing the campaign or minigames, noting the &quot;fantastic moments of surprise&quot; from friendly fire or nearby allies unintentionally preventing a wounded player from escaping. The magazine criticized the &quot;thorough, but flawed&quot; documentation and &quot;extremely intrusive copy protection&quot;, inability for keyboard players to strafe, and clumsy inventory management, but concluded that &quot;&quot;Hired Guns&quot; is viscerally satisfying&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Hired Guns 62nd on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

<text>Dodge City is a 1939 American Western film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ann Sheridan. Based on a story by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Texas cattle agent who witnesses the brutal lawlessness of Dodge City, Kansas and takes the job of sheriff to clean the town up. Filmed in Technicolor, &quot;Dodge City&quot; was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. This was the 5th of 8 movies that de Havilland and Flynn appeared in together.

Various scenes were shot in Thousand Oaks, including at present day Wildwood Regional Park.

==Plot==
The action of the film starts with Colonel Dodge (Henry O&#x27;Neill) arriving on the first train and subsequently opening the new railroad line that links Dodge City with the rest of the world. A few years later, Dodge City has turned into the &quot;longhorn cattle center of the world and wide-open Babylon of the American frontier, packed with settlers, thieves and gunmen—the town that knew no ethics but cash and killing&quot;. In particular, it is Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot) and his gang who kill, steal, cheat and, generally, control life in Dodge City without ever being brought to justice. Any new sheriff, sworn into office in Dodge, is quickly driven out of town by Surrett and his cronies.

Colonel Dodge&#x27;s friend Wade Hatton (Errol Flynn), a lone cowboy who was instrumental in bringing the railroad to Dodge City, is now on his way to the town leading a trek of settlers from the East coast. At Hatton&#x27;s side are his old companions Rusty (Alan Hale) and Tex (Guinn &quot;Big Boy&quot; Williams), who are prepared to stay with him through thick and thin. Among the settlers are beautiful Abbie Irving (Olivia de Havilland) and her irresponsible brother Lee (William Lundigan), who, drunk, causes a stampede (which eventually kills him) and is shot by Hatton in self-defense. When the group arrive in Dodge City, Hatton is confronted with the full extent of the anarchy which is dictating everyday life there. Asked by anxious citizens—Abbie&#x27;s uncle, Dr. Irving (Henry Travers) among them—to be the new sheriff, Hatton politely declines, saying he is not cut out for this kind of job.

Hatton changes his mind when, during a school outing, a young boy, Harry Cole is inadvertently killed by Surrett and his men. The new sheriff and his deputies—Rusty and Tex among them—have a hard time fighting the criminals. Regardless, all in all, Hatton was quite capable of his new job and was off to a good start cleaning up the town. Meanwhile, Hatton, Abbie and the likable newspaperman Joe Clemens (Frank McHugh) uncover enough evidence of Surrett&#x27;s shady dealings to stand a chance in court. Before Joe could publish a story, one of Surrett&#x27;s thugs, Yancey (Victor Jory) shoots the editor in the back. The only witness who can put Surrett behind bars now is Abbie whom Hatton, out of love for her, arranges to leave town for safety until further notice.

When Yancey is in jail for Joe&#x27;s killing, Hatton has to protect him against the furious men outside who, not caring for Yancey&#x27;s right to a fair trial, want to take the law into their own hands and lynch him. Intending to ensure that Yancey deserves a fair trial, Hatton and Rusty were able to manage to smuggle him out of town in a hearse to the train station where a train (which Abbie happens to be on) bound for Wichita was just about to leave. However, Surrett and his gang were waiting and sneak on board to try and spring Yancey. A gunfight then ensues and inadvertently causes a fire in the baggage car. Fearing for Hatton&#x27;s life, Abbie rushes to the baggage car to warn him of the danger. Using her as a shield, Surrett orders Hatton and Rusty to release Yancey immediately. Afterwards, Surrett locks Hatton, Abbie and Rusty in the burning car. After the three manage to escape from the car, Hatton and Rusty kill Surrett and his gang who were trying to make a getaway.

Hatton succeeds in both overwhelming and catching Surrett&#x27;s gang and winning Abbie&#x27;s heart. Everything has been prepared for a quiet family life in newly civilized Dodge City, but Hatton is asked by Colonel Dodge to clean up Virginia City, Nevada, another railroad town more dangerous than Dodge City had ever been. Understanding how much Hatton is needed to settle the West, a loving Abbie suggests she and her new husband join the next wagon train for their new life together, and Col. Dodge states that Hatton has married the right woman.

<text>Sprinting is running over a short distance at the top-most speed of the body in a limited period of time. It is used in many sports that incorporate running, typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. Human physiology dictates that a runner&#x27;s near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30–35 seconds due to the depletion of phosphocreatine stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive metabolic acidosis as a result of anaerobic glycolysis.

In athletics and track and field, sprints (or dashes) are races over short distances. They are among the oldest running competitions, being recorded at the Ancient Olympic Games. Three sprints are currently held at the modern Summer Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres.

At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before driving forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. The set position differs depending on the start. The use of starting blocks allows the sprinter to perform an enhanced isometric preload; this generates muscular pre-tension which is channeled into the subsequent forward drive, making it more powerful. Body alignment is of key importance in producing the optimal amount of force. Ideally, the athlete should begin in a 4-point stance and drive forwards, pushing off using both legs for maximum force production. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400 metres indoors. Races up to 100 metres are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete&#x27;s maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance.

==History==

The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event—the stadion race, which was a sprinting race from one end of the stadium to the other. The Diaulos (Δίαυλος, &quot;double pipe&quot;) was a double-stadion race, , introduced in the 14th Olympiad of the ancient Olympic Games (724BC).

Sprint races were part of the original Olympic Games in the 7th century B.C. as well as the first modern Olympic Games which started in the late 19th century (Athens 1896) and featured the 100 meters and 400 meters. Athletes started both races from a crouched start (4-point stance). In both the original Olympics and the modern Olympics, only men were allowed to participate in track and field until the 1928 games in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The 1928 games were also the first games to use a 400-meter track, which became the standard for track and field.

The modern sprinting events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distance came from the furlong (or mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440-yard dash or quarter-mile race.

Technological advances have always improved sprint performances (i.e., starting blocks, synthetic track material, and shoe technology). In 1924, athletes used a small shovel to dig holes to start the race. The world record in the 100-meter dash in 1924 was 10.4 seconds, while in 1948, (the first use of starting blocks) was 10.2 seconds, and was 10.1 seconds in 1956. The constant drive for faster athletes with better technology has brought man from 10.4 seconds to 9.58 seconds in less than 100 years.

Track events were measured with the metric system except for the United Kingdom and the United States until 1965 and 1974 respectively. The Amateur Athletic Association (AAU) decided to switch track and field in the U.S. to the metric system to finally make track and field internationally equivalent.

==Biological factors for runners==
Biological factors that determine a sprinter&#x27;s potential include:
* Height (minor factor)
* Muscular strength
* Adrenaline use
* Anaerobic respiration capacity
* Breathing
* Footspeed
* Proportion of fast twitch muscles
* Leg length
* Pelvic width

==Competitions==
===Common contemporary distances===

==== 60 meters ====

* Normally run indoors, on a straight section of an indoor athletic track.
* Some of the fastest humans reach their maximum speed around the 60-metre mark.
* 60-meters is often used as an outdoor distance by younger athletes when starting sprint racing.

Note: Indoor distances are less standardized, as many facilities run shorter or occasionally longer distances depending on available space. 60 m is the championship distance.

==== 100 meters ====

* Takes place on the straight of a standard outdoor 400 m track.
* Often, the world-record holder in this race is considered &quot;the world&#x27;s fastest man/woman.&quot;
* Primarily an outdoor race.

==== 200 meters ====

* Begins on the curve of a standard track (where the runners are staggered in their starting position, to ensure that they all run the same distance), and ends on the home straight.
* Competed both indoors and outdoors, with only slightly slower times than outdoors.

==== 400 meters ====

* Runners are staggered in their starting positions to ensure that everyone runs the same distance.
* Competed both indoors and outdoors, with only slightly slower times than outdoors.

==== 4 × 100 metres relay ====

* Runners are staggered in their starting positions to ensure that everyone runs the same distance.
* Runners use exchange zones (and, previously, separate acceleration zones which have now been eliminated) to pass a baton

==== 4 × 400 metres relay ====

* Runners are staggered in their starting positions to ensure that everyone runs the same distance.
* Runners use exchange zones to pass a baton.
* Typically, the final race at track meets.

===Historical and uncommon distances===

====50 yards (45.72 m)====
The event was a common event for most American students because it was one of the standardized test events as part of the President&#x27;s Award on Physical Fitness.

====50 m====
The 50 metres is an uncommon event and alternative to the 60 metres. Donovan Bailey holds the men&#x27;s world record with a time of 5.56 seconds and Irina Privalova holds the women&#x27;s world record with a time of 5.96 seconds.

====60 yards (54.864 m)====

* A rarely run sprinting event that was once more commonplace. The world record time of 5.99 is held by Lee McRae and was set in 1987. The time is often used for American Football speed training.

====55 m====
The 55 metres is an uncommon event that resulted from the metrication of the 60 yards and is an alternative to the 60 metres.

====70 yards (64.008 m)====
An extremely rare sprinting event, that was occasionally run in the 1960s. The world record of 6.90 is held by Bob Hayes.

====100 yards (91.44 m)====
* The outdoor standard in the English (imperial measured) speaking world. It was part of the Commonwealth Games up until 1966 and was the premier event in American high school sprinting until the NFHS changed to metric in 1980, now only a secondary distance to the 100 metres.
* The unofficial World Record Holder is Jamaican Asafa Powell with a time of 9.07 seconds.

====150 m====

* The informal distance of 150 metres (164.042 yards) can be used to work on a 100 m runner&#x27;s stamina, or a 200 m runner&#x27;s speed, and has been used as an exhibition distance. The distance was used in a race between the 1996 Olympic champions, the 100 m gold medalist Donovan Bailey (Canada) and the 200 m gold medalist Michael Johnson (USA). It was to decide which of the two was really the &#x27;fastest man on earth&#x27; (see Bailey–Johnson 150-metre race).
* The informal distance was used for an exhibition race during the Manchester Great CityGames as part of the 2009 Great Manchester Run (UK). Stars included Triple Olympic Champion Usain Bolt (Jamaica) alongside Ivory Williams (USA), Simeon Williamson (UK), and other international track stars. The female race included 400 m Olympic Champion, Christine Ohuruogu of Great Britain alongside Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie (Bahamas). Bolt ran the distance in a record time of 14.35 seconds.

====Stadion====

The stadion, also known as the stade, was the standard short distance sprint in ancient Greece and ran the length of a stadium. However, stadiums could vary in size and there was apparently no definite standard length for them, e.g., the stadium at Delphi measures 177 m and the one at Pergamon 210 m.

====300 m====
* The 300 metres is another informal distance, which could be used to aid a 200 m runner&#x27;s stamina, or a 400 m runner&#x27;s speed. Currently, the world&#x27;s best for this event is 30.69 seconds, set by Letsile Tebogo at altitude in Pretoria, South Africa in 2024. The women&#x27;s record is 34.41 seconds, set by Shaunae Miller-Uibo in Ostrava, Czech Republic in 2019. Junior girls in several countries run this distance instead of the 400 metres.

====Diaulos====
The diaulos was an event contested in the Ancient Greek Olympia that was double the length of a stadion.

As well as standard foot races, in Ancient Greece there was also a sprint race called the hoplitodromos (&#x27;armed &quot;diaulos&quot;&#x27;). This required the sprinters to additionally carry a large shield and wear a helmet. Similarly to the diaulos, they ran two stades in length i.e. one stade ending with a 180 degree turn around a post, which led onto the second stade in length back down the track. In the diaulos, each sprinter had an individual post to run around. However, for some hoplitodromos races all of the sprinters ran around a single central post.

==== 4 × 200 metres relay ====

* Runners are staggered in their starting positions to ensure that everyone runs the same distance.
* Runners use acceleration zones and exchange zones to pass a baton

== Equipment ==

=== Shoes ===
Typically, a sprinter only needs two types of shoes, training shoes and sprinting spikes.

Sprinting spikes are typically designed to be lightweight, with a minimal cushion on the heels and a plate on the forefoot to keep the runner on the toes of each foot. The spike plate will typically have the maximum number of holes for metal spikes to be inserted to keep a proper grip on the track surface. These metal removable spikes also come in varying sizes. The spikes typically range from 4 mm to 15 mm and come in different styles. Most facilities have specific requirements for what size and style spikes can be used.

=== Starting Blocks ===
Starting blocks are not a necessity but are highly suggested for use in sprinting events. Starting blocks are a piece of equipment that typically consists of foot pads attached to a central rail. The point of using blocks is to help the athlete push themselves further down the track as quickly as possible.

==== Typical Block Start Set-up ====

* Place heel slightly on the starting line
* Place the blocks in the center of the track, approximately where your toe is.
* The dominant foot will be in the front block. With the paddle being set at 45 degrees
* The front block will be about 1 -2 foot lengths from the starting line.
* The non-dominant foot will be in the back block.  The paddle will be set as high as possible.
* The back block will be set about 3–3 foot lengths from the starting line.
* The front block and back block are only about 1-foot in length apart.
* The toes should barely touch the ground.  
* Hands will be placed about shoulder-width apart, with the thumb and pointer finger slightly behind the line.
* Arms should be in a straight position (locked or prepared to be locked at the elbows)
* The arms will remain straight (if not locked at the elbows)
* The hips will rise slightly above the shoulders (forcing the front half of the body to lean forward at about 45 degrees (slightly less)).
* A forward lean is optimal because it shifts most of the weight to the hands with a minimal bend to the back.
* The dominant leg should have about a 90-degree bend at the knee, while the non-dominant leg should be about 120 degrees
* The arm on the dominant foot side will swing forward in an &quot;exaggerated&quot; fashion, while the arm on the non-dominant side will swing backward in the same fashion
* The non-dominant foot will be the first step.
* The non-dominant leg should come out with a long (within comfort&#x27;s range) stride, bringing the knee to a 90-degree position (separation of the foot and opposite leg&#x27;s knee about 2–2 feet), approximately a 45-degree shin angle, and dorsiflexion with each stride.
* Halfway before the first step lands, the &quot;driving&quot; position should have a straight line through the non-dominant ankle, knee, hips, shoulders, and head.

=== Baton ===
The baton is a required element for any relay race. The baton is passed to each athlete through different exchange zones, with different techniques. Typically, about and in diameter.

=== Timing ===

==== Stopwatches ====
Used typically in training sessions to measure relative times and recovery times. Stopwatches are not always the most accurate way to measure times in a race setting,

==== Fully Automatic Timing / Gate Systems ====
Fully Automatic Timing (FAT) and gate systems are used to accurately measure races, with results as accurate as up to 1/1000 of a second.  

== Governing Bodies ==
As of 2021, World Athletics (WA) is the governing body for track and field around the world. Every country that wishes to participate in WA competitions must become a member.

==Rules==

=== Rule differences with each Governing Bodies ===
Each governing body sets its own rules for how competition is deemed fair.  World Athletics sets the competition rules internationally. The World Athletics rulebook is broken into 4 separate books.

===The start===

Starting blocks are used for all competition sprints (up to and including 400 m) and relay events (first leg only, up to 4x400 m). The starting blocks consist of two adjustable footplates attached to a rigid frame. Races commence with the firing of the starter&#x27;s gun. The starting commands are &quot;On your marks&quot; and &quot;Set&quot;. Once all athletes are in the set position, the starter&#x27;s gun is fired, officially starting the race. For the 100 m, all competitors are lined up side by side. For the 200 m, 300 m, and 400 m, which involve curves, runners are staggered for the start.

In the rare event that there are technical issues with a start, a green card is shown to all the athletes. The green card carries no penalty. If an athlete is unhappy with track conditions after the &quot;on your marks&quot; command is given, the athlete must raise a hand before the &quot;set&quot; command and provide the Start referee with a reason. It is then up to the Start referee to decide if the reason is valid. If the Start referee deems the reason invalid, a yellow card (warning) is issued to that particular athlete. If the athlete is already on a warning, the athlete is disqualified.

===False starts===
According to the World Athletics (WA) rules, &quot;An athlete, after assuming a full and final set position, shall not commence his starting motion until after receiving the report of the gun or approved starting apparatus. If, in the judgement of the Starter or Recallers, he does so any earlier, it shall be deemed a false start.&quot;

The 100 m Olympic gold and silver medallist Linford Christie of Great Britain famously had frequent false starts that were marginally below the legal reaction time of 0.1  seconds. Christie and his coach, Ron Roddan, both claimed that the false starts were due to Christie&#x27;s exceptional reaction times being under legal time. His frequent false starting eventually led to his disqualification from the 1996 Summer Olympics 100 m final in Atlanta, the US, due to a second false start by Christie. Since January 2010, under WA rules, a single false start by an athlete resulted in disqualification.

In 2012, a new development to the false start rule was added. Because certain athletes could be disqualified for twitching in the starting blocks, but some athletes could make a twitch without the starter noticing and disqualifying the athlete, it was decided that twitching in the starting block while being in the &#x27;set&#x27; position would only carry a maximum penalty of a yellow card or a warning. To instantly be disqualified for a false start, an athlete&#x27;s hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks, while the athlete is in their final &#x27;set&#x27; position.

===Lanes===

For all Olympic sprint events, runners must remain within their pre-assigned lanes, which measure 1.22 metres (4 feet) wide, from start to finish. The lanes can be numbered 1 through 8, 9, or rarely 10, starting with the inside lane. Any athlete who runs outside the assigned lane to gain an advantage is subject to disqualification. If the athlete is forced to run outside of his or her lane by another person, and no material advantage is gained, there will be no disqualification. Also, a runner who strays from his or her lane in the straightaway, or crosses the outer line of his or her lane on the bend, and gains no advantage by it, will not be disqualified as long as no other runner is obstructed.

===The finish===
The first athlete whose torso reaches the vertical plane of the closest edge of the finish line is the winner. To ensure that the sprinter&#x27;s torso triggers the timing impulse at the finish line rather than an arm, foot, or other body parts, a double Photocell is commonly used. Times are only recorded by an electronic timing system when both of these Photocells are simultaneously blocked.
Photo finish systems are also used at some track and field events.

== World Records==


== Sprint training ==

While genetics play a large role in one&#x27;s ability to sprint, athletes must be dedicated to their training to ensure that they can optimize their performances. Sprint training includes various running workouts, targeting acceleration, speed development, speed endurance, special endurance, and tempo endurance. Additionally, athletes perform intense strength training workouts, as well as plyometric or jumping workouts. Collectively, these training methods produce qualities that allow athletes to be stronger, and more powerful, in hopes of ultimately running faster.

<text>Reginald Endicott Barclay III is a fictional engineer from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. On television and in film, he has been portrayed by Dwight Schultz since the character&#x27;s introduction in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; third season episode &quot;Hollow Pursuits.&quot; Schultz played the character for five episodes and one feature film (&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;) of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, as well as six episodes of the series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Barclay also appears in non-canon &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels and video games.

Schultz was cast in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; thanks to Whoopi Goldberg (Guinan). Initially disappointed not to be playing an alien character, Schultz never anticipated becoming such a fan-favorite. Barclay underwent changes from, as first conceived, a malicious character—someone that aggravated the crew to compensate for his inferiority complex—to the softer and more benign engineer that made it to air. Schultz and others saw Barclay as a tribute to the average &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, though the producers said that was unintentional.

During &quot;The Next Generation&quot; televised run, Barclay was stationed aboard the . He was then posted at the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center before being aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E for the events of &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;. For his season six and seven &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; appearances, Barclay was assigned to the Pathfinder Project, a Starfleet Communications endeavor to communicate with the stranded in the Delta Quadrant.

==Conception==
University of Rochester professor Sarah Higley created Reginald Barclay in her script for the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; third-season episode &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot;. Before writing the script, Higley knew that she wanted to write about the less-exceptional members of the crew, saying, &quot;I thought there wasn&#x27;t enough emphasis on the less outstanding, less &quot;wunderkind&quot;-like crew members&quot;. She described her initial conception of Barclay as &quot;a repulsive guy […] wrapped up in himself, brilliant in his field, [and] socially a wash-out.&quot; She gave him the pompous name Endicott Reginald Barclay III to suggest he &quot;had always suffered from an inferiority complex and just couldn&#x27;t deal with the ultra-maturity and shining qualities of the rest of the crew.&quot; Higley based Barclay on Till Eulenspiegel, a prankster from German folklore: the original Barclay pranked the crew, taunted them about their weaknesses, and called their bluffs before being sent to a psychiatric hospital.

Paramount Television bought &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; within a week of Higley&#x27;s submission, but wanted to change the script to make Barclay save the day while being less acerbic and sarcastic. Higley would later recall how she had made Barclay &quot;repugnant&quot; while the studio wanted somebody with whom the audience could identify: someone &quot;whose stuttering, shyness and lack of self-confidence would speak to [the] shy and socially maladjusted&quot;. As the character&#x27;s actor, Dwight Schultz described Barclay as a ground-breaking character in terms of his normal fallibility. In the British magazine, &quot;TV Zone&quot;, Schultz thanked Roddenberry for creating the character, saying, &quot;He realized that that type of character was missing from the programme and, eventually, said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s fill that spot.

In a script for &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot;, Barclay is described as a &quot;shy individual with a perpetual frown born of stress and unhappiness between his brows. […] What we notice most about him is that he is uncomfortable around other people to the point of agony… he rarely makes eye contact… when he speaks, he hesitates, desperately afraid of saying the wrong thing… which he occasionally does.&quot;

==Casting==

Schultz was a fan of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;; it was the first television series he watched in color. Schultz would wait for each episode to air, and then meet with friends after school to discuss the themes and plot of each one. &quot;The Next Generation&quot; showrunner Michael Piller recalled that sometime prior to casting Schultz, the actor had told executive producer Rick Berman that he would love to appear on the show. Schultz himself credits Whoopi Goldberg (Guinan) with his opportunity to play Barclay. In 1990, Schultz was working with Goldberg on &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot; when he discussed with her that he was a big fan of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and knew Brent Spiner (Data) and Jonathan Frakes (William Riker) from his time in New York City. Then, approximately a month after returning from &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot;, Schultz heard from his talent manager that the powers-that-be at &quot;The Next Generation&quot; had extended a job offer. Piller and Berman did not think they would actually be able to land Schultz for the spot because the actor had done &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; with Paul Newman and &quot;was very hot&quot;. Schultz anticipated playing &quot;a large vein-throbbing, bulbous-headed alien,&quot; and was initially disappointed to be offered Barclay instead. Schultz thought Barclay was going to be merely a one-off character, and did not anticipate it becoming a recurring gig.

==Character history==
===Canon===
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, Barclay has appeared in twelve discrete productions from 1990 to 2001.

====Lieutenant, junior grade====
In his inaugural appearance in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s third season episode &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot;, Lieutenant Junior Grade Barclay is addicted to using the holodeck and recreates the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D on the holodeck with attributes and in settings which allow him to more easily interact with them. Crewmembers find him difficult to work with, and Wesley calls him &quot;Broccoli&quot; behind his back. Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) both support Barclay in escaping to his fantasies, though Troi is annoyed to later find herself recreated as &quot;the Goddess of Empathy&quot;, in what Dr. Lynne Joyrich—Brown University professor of modern culture and media—described as &quot;a clear sexual invitation&quot;. Despite his embarrassment, Barclay saves the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;gaining both self-confidence and a newfound respect from his peers as a result.&quot;

For the fourth season, bringing back Barclay was on executive producer Michael Piller&#x27;s to-do list, but they were having trouble finding a vehicle for the character; they did not want to return to the well again for the &quot;nervous chap in the holodeck&quot;. Joe Menosky wrote &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; about a crew member who becomes superintelligent, and it was suggested that they could slot Barclay into that role. Barclay is affected by an alien space probe which induces the superintelligence. Under the influence of the probe, he modifies the ship extensively and propels it to the center of the Milky Way. After losing his heightened intelligence, Barclay explains that it was the probe&#x27;s creators who impelled his actions as a way of meeting new species.

Barclay returns in the season six episode &quot;Realm of Fear&quot;. It is revealed that Barclay is phobic about using the transporter, an aspect of the character that was derived from episode writer Brannon Braga&#x27;s own fear of flying. After transporting back from another vessel (the USS &quot;Yosemite&quot;), Barclay insists he sees creatures in the matter stream. Overcoming his fears, Barclay is repeatedly transported until he grabs hold of one of the creatures which turns out to be a missing crew member from the &quot;Yosemite&quot;.

In the second season&#x27;s &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot;, a troublemaking self-aware holoprogram of Professor Moriarty (Daniel Davis) was accidentally created and then stored in long-term memory at the end of the episode. That episode&#x27;s sequel, season six&#x27;s &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;, finds Barclay inadvertently releasing Moriarty, who wrests control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by trapping Picard, Data, and Barclay inside nested holodecks. Barclay was included because it was initially felt that the episode needed a character ignorant of season two events. Though this characteristic was ultimately unnecessary, episode writer René Echevarria opined that only Barclay could have pulled off the episode&#x27;s final moment where Barclay momentarily questions whether he was still in a simulated reality.

Season seven&#x27;s &quot;Genesis&quot; was Barclay&#x27;s last episodic appearance on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. After Barclay comes down with the Urodelan flu, the attempted cure accidentally becomes a virus, spreading among and devolving the crew. Episode writer Brannon Braga described choosing to devolve Barclay into a spider as the natural choice: &quot;I just thought it would be fun to make Barclay a spider because I can&#x27;t imagine anything more awful to become. It just seemed natural since he&#x27;s a kind of nervous and wiry guy, that maybe he would have had more arachnid ancestors than&quot; other crewmembers. After Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Data (Brent Spiner) cure the afflicted, Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) names the virus &quot;Barclay&#x27;s Protomorphosis Syndrome&quot;.

Schultz next appeared as Barclay in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; second season episode &quot;Projections&quot;. Originally, the guest star was going to be &quot;The Next Generation&quot; LeVar Burton as Geordi La Forge, but episode writer Brannon Braga decided it would be much more fun to couple Barclay with the Doctor (Robert Picardo), holographic software called the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH). In &quot;Projections&quot;, Barclay is a delusion of the Doctor&#x27;s program, trying to convince the Doctor that he was not a hologram but instead a flesh-and-blood being running a simulation of the and its crew. According to the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Companion&quot;, Barclay was a part of the original engineering team at the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center that developed the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), and that Barclay himself was in charge of testing the program&#x27;s social skills. The &quot;Companion&quot; further infers that Barclay took a leave of absence from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to work on the EMH because the character is aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E in the 1996 film, &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

Barclay was not originally supposed to be in the feature film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;; it was director Jonathan Frakes who suggested including Barclay as opposed to &quot;a new lieutenant character&quot;. Schultz was contacted on a Tuesday, asked if he could come in that Friday, and the actor said, &quot;Sure.&quot; In his only scene, Barclay uses an interaction with La Forge as an excuse to meet Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) and shake his hand.

====Lieutenant====
Following the events of &quot;First Contact&quot;, in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; sixth season episode &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, now-Lieutenant Barclay has been stationed on Earth for two years. He is assigned to Starfleet Communications&#x27; Pathfinder Project, the mission of which is reestablishing contact with the lost . After becoming obsessed with his holographic recreation of the &quot;Voyager&quot; and her crew, Barclay seeks counseling with the visiting Deanna Troi. Despite her urgings, Barclay disobeys orders from his supervisor (Richard McGonagle) to test an unproven theory. After being caught by security officers, Barclay&#x27;s theory pans out, and all is forgiven as Starfleet briefly communicates with &quot;Voyager&quot; personnel for the first time since the fourth season episode &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;.

Barclay returns to the Jupiter Station Holoprogramming Center in &quot;Life Line&quot; to liaise between the Doctor and his programmer, Lewis Zimmerman (also portrayed by Robert Picardo). Barclay again enlists Counselor Troi&#x27;s help to convince Zimmerman to allow the Doctor to treat him for an as-yet untreatable illness; Zimmerman is dismissive of the Doctor&#x27;s abilities and expertise because that generation of the EMH software was decommissioned by Starfleet as unfit. When psychotherapy fails, Barclay sabotages the Doctor&#x27;s program to force Zimmerman to come to terms with his creation; though Zimmerman uncovers Barclay&#x27;s subterfuge, he successfully repairs the holoprogram and consents to treatment.

Prior to the events of season seven&#x27;s &quot;Inside Man&quot;, Barclay has been tinkering with holography again, developing interactive holograms of himself to send to the &quot;Voyager&quot;. After it appears that the holographic program has failed to reach &quot;Voyager&quot; for a second month in a row, Barclay intrudes on Troi&#x27;s vacation to confide in her that he believes his ex-girlfriend (Sharisse Baker-Bernard) may have something to do with it. It is uncovered that Barclay was a patsy and that Ferengi have commandeered his holoprogram to lead the &quot;Voyager&quot; to its doom so that they can profit from Seven of Nine&#x27;s (Jeri Ryan) Borg technology. Barclay tricks the Ferengi in the guise of his hologram and defuses the situation.

Schultz appears as Barclay again in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Author, Author&quot;. With the help of Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and Seven of Nine, Barclay achieves live communication between Earth and the &quot;Voyager&quot; for eleven minutes a day. Later, Barclay alerts Admiral Paris (Richard Herd) to the distribution of the Doctor&#x27;s holonovel.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; series finale &quot;Endgame&quot;, Schultz appears as Barclay both in the series&#x27; future (2404) and in the series&#x27; present (2378). In the future he is Commander Barclay, and a lecturer at Starfleet Academy who provides an aged Admiral Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) with data and a shuttlecraft she will need to travel back in time. In this future, Barclay has overcome his stuttering except when under stress. In the present, Barclay is present alongside Admiral Paris at Starfleet Communications when the &quot;Voyager&quot; returns home to Earth.

===Non-canon appearances===

Barclay also appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; video game &quot;Star Trek: Elite Force II&quot; (2003), where he is voiced by Schultz.

==Analysis==
Describing the character as &quot;an average person who was fallible [and] prone to mistakes,&quot; Schultz thought Barclay was quite unlike any previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; character. Schultz was surprised to be asked back to &quot;The Next Generation&quot; for &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; in season four, not realizing how popular the character was with fans. After Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard) insisted that he join the convention circuit, Schultz was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the reaction: &quot;[People] really do identify with Barclay because he has difficulties. He&#x27;s not the super-perfect Starfleet officer you often see on Star Trek, and the audience loves him because of that.&quot;
In &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, Schultz relished playing Barclay as the character he had always envisioned him to be: &quot;a fan. In his case, he was the ultimate fan of the scientist who invented warp drive.&quot; Authors Lynne Joyrich and Robin Roberts, and &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; writer Sarah Higley all came to the same conclusion as Schultz: that Barclay is meant to be a mirror to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, with Higley saying, &quot;Barclay is a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, making these wonderful &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters in the Holodeck say and do whatever he wants them to do.&quot; In the book &quot;The Influence of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on Television, Film and Culture&quot;, Sue Short goes even further, suggesting Barclay is a Mary Sue. The authors describe Barclay as an &quot;archetypal Trek-nerd, opting to exist in a fantasy world due to inadequacies that prevent him from fully engaging with the real one.&quot; Writing about Barclay&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot;, the character seems to endorse a perception of fans as &quot;psychologically disordered&quot; or &quot;dangerously delusional&quot;. Both showrunner Michael Piller and director Cliff Bole disagree with the perception that Barclay was meant to represent &quot;self-absorbed &quot;Trek&quot; fans who are so obsessed with the show that they are oblivious to reality.&quot; Piller felt &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; was more about the theme of &#x27;fantasy vs. reality&#x27; while Bole felt the audience would instead be attracted to the holodeck vignettes such as the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; allusion.

In his analysis of stuttering in visual media for &quot;The Journal of Popular Culture&quot;, PhD candidate Jeffrey K. Johnson puts forward that stuttering is a sort of &quot;storytelling shorthand&quot; for nervous and weak characters. Barclay is portrayed not simply as a person who stutters, but a &quot;shy, backward, phobic&quot; hypochondriac whose stuttering is a symptom of these deficiencies. &quot;On a starship filled with courageous and often heroic personnel[,] the one character that is shown to have multiple anxieties and weaknesses is also the one who stutters.&quot; In &quot;Endgame&quot;, when Barclay becomes confident and assertive in the future, he has also stopped stuttering. Johnson contrasts this depiction of stuttering with &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s depiction of other disabled characters: Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) is blind, but nonetheless capable and heroic, and Riva (Howie Seago)—from the episode &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot;—is deaf, yet &quot;is revered for his strong character and excellent communication skills.&quot;

Terry L. Shepherd, a professor of special education at Indiana University South Bend, wrote in &quot;Teaching Exceptional Children&quot; about how showing disabled children likewise disabled &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters can improve their situations at school. Shepherd uses Barclay as an example of this, stating how even though the character does not completely overcome his social anxiety disorder by the end of &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot;, he has made steps towards improving his self-confidence.

In discussing &quot;Star Trek: The Experience&quot; and its emphasis on the masculine aspects of &quot;Star Trek&quot; for the academic journal &quot;Extrapolation&quot;, Robin Roberts notes how the holodeck-centric episodes of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; focus on men using the simulator. Roberts goes on to say that when Barclay &quot;is no longer in control of his holodeck simulations, [he] is feminized and faces being fired from Starfleet.&quot; Roberts also explains how Barclay is intended to be not only &quot;[a] stand-in for &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans&quot;, but also representing both &quot;Experience&quot; participants and home viewers &quot;who are not in control of the fantasy narrative.&quot;

In &quot;The Influence of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on Television, Film and Culture&quot;, Sue Short described Barclay as &quot;the most improbable member of Starfleet&quot; due to his propensity for daydreaming and solitary pursuits. Yet it is Barclay&#x27;s outside-the-box thinking that saves the day more than once.

==Reception==
In 2016, &quot;Wired&quot; ranked Barclay 55 out of their top 100 most-important &quot;Star Trek&quot; crewmembers. IndieWire ranked the crew of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 2017, and Barclay was number 16 of 17, ranking only higher than season two&#x27;s Katherine Pulaski. When Comic Book Resources ranked &quot;Star Trek&quot; best 20 recurring characters in 2018, Barclay was sixth behind Sarek, Lwaxana Troi, Dukat, Elim Garak, and Q. &quot;Syfy Wire&quot; ranked Barclay 10th on their 2019 list of 21 best supporting characters. That same year, Screen Rant placed Barclay ninth in their list of the ten smartest &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters, ahead of Seven of Nine.

The character of Barclay was well received by fans, a number of whom made websites in his honor. A &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; Barclay action figure was originally limited to 1,701 pieces, but after fan outcry was increased to 3,000.

<text>Middle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints, ranging from 500 metres up to two miles (3218.688 metres). The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 1500 m came about as a result of running laps of a 400 m outdoor track or laps of a 200 m indoor track, which were commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.

Middle-distance running is unique in that it typically requires attributes found in both sprinters and long-distance runners, including combinations of both footspeed &quot;and&quot; aerobic endurance. Middle-distance racing is commonly reported to be a highly intense physical experience, requiring large amounts of anaerobic exertion from the body. 

==Events==
===500 metres===

A very uncommon middle-distance event that is sometimes run by sprinters for muscle stamina training.

===600 yards===

This was a popular distance, particularly indoors, when imperial distances were common. In the era of wooden 11-lap-to-a-mile tracks (common prior to metrication), this was one lap longer than a quarter-mile.

In 1882, American Lon Myers set what was then a world record at , running it in 1:11.4.

The event was a common event for most American students because it was one of the standardized test events as part of the President&#x27;s Award on Physical Fitness. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Martin McGrady, who had minimal success at longer or shorter races, made his reputation, set world records and drew many fans to arenas to watch him race elite competitors, including Olympians, at this unusual distance.

===600 metres===

This middle-distance length is rather uncommon and is mainly run by sprinters wishing to test their endurance at a longer distance. Like other middle-distance races, it evolved from the 600 yard race. The 600 m is also used as an early season stepping stone by 800 m runners before they have reached full race fitness.

Johnny Gray (United States) holds the record for men: 1:12.81 set at Santa Monica on 24 May 1986.

Caster Semenya (South Africa) holds the women&#x27;s record: 1:21.77 set at Berlin on 27 August 2017.

===800 metres===

The 800 m consists of two laps around a standard 400 m track and has always been an Olympic event. It was included in the first women&#x27;s track programme in 1928 but was suspended until 1960.

David Rudisha (Kenya) is the current recordholder: 1:40.91, London, 9 August 2012. Jarmila Kratochvílová (Czechoslovakia) set the current women&#x27;s record: 1:53.28, Munich, 26 July 1983.

===880 yards===
The run, or half-mile, was the forebear to the 800 m distance and has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s.

===1000 metres===

This distance is not commonly raced, though it is more common than the 500 m event is for sprinters. This is commonly raced as an indoor men&#x27;s heptathlon event, or as an indoor high school event. In 1881, Lon Myers set what was then a world record at 1000 yards, running it in 2:13.0.

The men&#x27;s record is held by Noah Ngeny (Kenya) (2:11.96, Rieti, 5 September 1999), while Svetlana Masterkova (Russia) set the women&#x27;s record (2:28.98, Brussels, 23 August 1996).

===1200 metres===
Three laps. A distance seldom raced on its own, but commonly raced as part of the distance medley relay.

There are no recorded world records or world bests. However, Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco) is believed to be the fastest man at this distance: 2:44.75, Rieti, 2002.

This distance is short of three quarters of a mile (1,320 yards or 1,207m) by about 7 metres.

===1500 metres===

Also known as the metric mile, this is a premier middle-distance race, covering three and three-quarters laps around a standard Olympic-sized track. In recent years, races over this distance have become more of a prolonged sprint, with each lap averaging 55 seconds for the world record performance by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco: 3:26.00 on 14 July 1998 at Rome (two 1:50 min 800 m performances back to back). Thus, speed is necessary, and it seems that the more aerobic conditioning, the better.

Faith Kipyegon from Kenya holds the women&#x27;s world record: 3:49.04 set in Paris on 7 July 2024.

This is a difficult distance at which to compete mentally, in addition to being one of the more tactical middle-distance track events. The distance is often witness to some of the most tactical, physical races in the sport, as many championship races are won in the final few metres.

===1600 metres===

At exactly four laps of a normal 400 m track, this distance is raced as a near replacement for the mile (it is, in fact, 9.344 m, about 30.6 feet, shorter; however, it is still colloquially referred to as &quot;the mile&quot;). The 1600 meters is the official distance for this range of races in US high schools. While this race is rarely run outside high school and collegiate invitational competitions, it has been held at the international level. The 1500 m, however, is the most common distance run at the college and international levels. The final leg of a distance medley relay is 1600 metres.

An accurate way to run an actual mile on a metric track is to run the additional 9.344 meters before starting the first marked 400-meter lap. Many tracks, especially high-level tracks, will have a waterfall starting line drawn 9.344 meters back for this purpose. Otherwise, on a metric track, there will be a relay zone 10 meters before the common start/finish line, frequently marked by a triangle pointed toward the finish. In many configurations, that triangle is about half a meter wide, making its point extremely close to the mile start line, which would be slightly less than two feet from the marked relay zone (the widest part of the triangle, or line).

When converted down to 1600m, Hicham El Guerrouj ran an equivalent of a 3:41.83 1600m in his 1999 world record mile of 3:43.13.

Likewise, when converted down to 1600m, Faith Kipyegon ran an equivalent of a 4:06.20 1600m in her 2023 world record mile of 4:07.64.

===Mile===

This length of middle-distance race, , is very common in countries that do not use the metric system, and is still often referred to as the &quot;Blue Riband&quot; of the track. When World Athletics (then known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation) decided in 1976 to recognize only world records for metric distances, it made an exception for the mile, and records are kept to this day.

Historically, the mile took the place that the 1500 m has today. It is still raced on the world-class level, but usually only on select occasions, like the famous Wanamaker Mile, held annually at the Millrose Games. Running a mile in less than four minutes is a famously difficult achievement, long thought impossible by the scientific community. The first man to break the four-minute barrier was Englishman Roger Bannister at Oxford in 1954.

The current record holders are Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco) (3:43.13, Rome, 7 July 1999) and Faith Kipyegon (Kenya) (4:07.64, Monaco, 21 July 2023).

===2000 metres===

The men&#x27;s world record is held by Norway&#x27;s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who ran a time of 4:43.13 in 2023, beating the previous record held by Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco) (4:44.79, Berlin, 7 September 1999).

Jessica Hull of Australia is the women&#x27;s world record holder, with her time of 5:19.70, ran in 2024.

The 2000m is not an official world record event indoors.

===3000 metres===

Truly on the borderline between middle and longer distances, the 3000 m (7.5 laps) is a standard race in the United States. Between 1983 and 1993 it was a world championship event for women at the outdoor World Athletics Championships and Olympics. The 1984 Olympic race was famous for the controversial collision between Mary Decker and Zola Budd. The race has been a fixture at the World Athletics Indoor Championships since its inception in 1985 as the longest race for both men and women. This race requires decent speed, but a lack of natural quickness can be made up for with superior aerobic conditioning and race tactics. The records at this distance were set by Jakob Ingebrigtsen (Norway) (7:17.55, Silesia, 25 August 2024) and Junxia Wang (China) (8:06.11, Beijing, 13 September 1993).

===3200 metres===
At exactly eight laps on a standard 400 m track, this event is typically run only in American high schools, along with the 1600 m. It is colloquially called the &quot;two-mile&quot;, as the distance is only 18.688 metres shorter. In college, the typical runner of this event would convert to the 5,000-metre run (or potentially the 3,000-metre run during the indoor season). In most eastern American high schools, colleges, and middle schools, this event is usually considered a long-distance event, depending on the region. It is the longest track distance run in most high school competitions.

Jakob Ingebrigtsen ran an equivalent of a 7:51.35 3200m in his 2023 world best of 7:54.10 in the two mile run.

Meseret Defar ran an equivalent of an 8:55.45 3200m in her 2007 world best of 8:58.58 in the two mile run.

===Two miles===

This length of long middle-distance or short long-distance race was .

Historically, the two-mile took the place that the 3000 m and the 3200 m have today. The first man to break the four-minute barrier for both miles was Daniel Komen (Kenya) at Hechtel, Belgium on 19 July 1997 in a time of 7:58.61. The current world record in the two-mile is held by Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who ran 7:54.10 in the 2023 Paris Diamond League meet on 9 June 2023, although the distance&#x27;s world record is not tracked by the International Olympic Committee. Meseret Defar (Ethiopia) is the fastest woman: 8:58.58, Brussels, Belgium, 14 September 2007.

===2000 metres steeplechase===

Another race is only run in high school or Master meets. The typical specialist in this event would move up to the 3000-metre steeplechase in college.

===3,000-metre steeplechase===
A 3,000-metre steeplechase is a distance event requiring greater strength, stamina, and agility than the flat 3,000-metre event. This is because athletes are required to jump over five barriers per lap, after a flat first 200 m to allow for settling in. One barrier per lap is placed in front of a water pit, meaning that runners are also forced to deal with the chafing of wet shoes as they race. The world records are held by Lamecha Girma (Ethiopia) (7:52.11, Paris. 9 June 2023) and Gulnara Samitova (Russia) (8:58.81, Beijing, 17 August 2008).

<text>is a type of traditional Japanese embroidery or stitching used for the decorative and/or functional reinforcement of cloth and clothing. Owing to the relatively cheap nature of white cotton thread and the abundant nature of cheap, indigo-dyed blue cloth in historical Japan, has a distinctive appearance of white-on-blue embroidery, though some decorative pieces may also use red thread.

== History ==
First coming into existence in the Edo period (1603–1867), embroidery was first applied to clothing out of a practical need, and would have been used to strengthen the homespun clothes of olden times. Worn out clothes were pieced together to make new garments by using simple running stitches. These clothes increased their strength with this durable embroidery. By the Meiji period (1868–1912), had been established enough that it had evolved into winter work in northern farming communities, when it was too cold to work outside.

 was commonly used to reinforce already-patched clothing around points of wear, but would also be used to attach patches to clothing, making the fabric ultimately stronger. It would also be used to layer thin fabrics to create warmth, and, in the case of some garments such as the coats of firemen , to create a thick and absorbent material that would be soaked in water before carrying out duties as a fireman. Though most utilises only a plain running stitch technique, is commonly used to create decorative and repeated embroidered patterns, and may be used for purely decorative purposes, such as in the creation of quilts and embroidery samplers.

==Designs and patterns==
 utilises mostly geometric patterns, which fall into two main styles; , in which patterns are created with long lines of running stitches; and , where the pattern emerges from the alignment of single stitches made on a grid. Common motifs are waves, mountains, bamboo, arrow feathers, , pampas grass and interlocking geometric shapes, amongst others. embroidery is traditionally applied with the use of specialist needles and thread, though modern day may use modern embroidery threads and embroidery needles.

Many patterns were derived from Chinese designs, but just as many were developed by native Japanese embroiderers; for example, the style known as , which generally consists of diamond-shaped patterns in horizontal rows, is a distinctive variety of that was developed in Aomori Prefecture. Other developments in have come from the work of Japanese artists, such as Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849), whose 1824 &quot;New Forms for Design&quot; inspired many patterns.

 designs typically derive from nature, with some, considered to hold symbolism, seen particularly on garments such as the coats of fishermen.

<text>Long-distance running, or endurance running, is a form of continuous running over distances of at least . Physiologically, it is largely aerobic in nature and requires stamina as well as mental strength.

Within endurance running comes two different types of respiration. The more prominent side that runners experience more frequently is aerobic respiration. This occurs when oxygen is present, and the body can utilize oxygen to help generate energy and muscle activity. On the other side, anaerobic respiration occurs when the body is deprived of oxygen, and this is common towards the final stretch of races when there is a drive to speed up to a greater intensity. Overall, both types of respiration are used by endurance runners quite often but are very different from each other.

Among mammals, humans are well adapted for running significant distances, particularly so among primates. The capacity for endurance running is also found in migratory ungulates and a limited number of terrestrial carnivores, such as bears, dogs, wolves, and hyenas.

In modern human society, long-distance running has multiple purposes: people may engage in it for physical exercise, for recreation, as a means of travel, as a competitive sport, for economic reasons, or cultural reasons. Long-distance running can also be used as a means to improve cardiovascular health.

Endurance running is often a component of physical military training. Long-distance running as a form of tradition or ceremony is known among the Hopi and Tarahumara people, among others.

In the sport of athletics, long-distance events are defined as races covering and above. The three most common types are track running, road running, and cross country running, all of which are defined by their terrain – all-weather tracks, roads, and natural terrain, respectively.

==History==
===Hunting===

Anthropological observations of modern hunter-gatherer communities have provided accounts for long-distance running as a historic method for hunting among the San of the Kalahari, American Indians, and Aboriginal Australians. In this method, the hunter would run at a slow and steady pace for between one hour and a few days, in an area where the animal has no place to hide. The animal, running in spurts, has to stop to pant to cool itself, but as the chase goes on it would not have enough time before it has to start running again, and after a while would collapse from exhaustion and heat. The skeletal structure of a 12-year-old Nariokatome boy has been suggested as proof that early humans from 1.5 million years ago ate more meat and fewer plants, and hunted by running down animals.

===Messengers===
With developments in agriculture and culture, long-distance running took more and more purposes other than hunting: religious ceremonies, delivering messages for military and political purposes, and sport.

Running messengers are reported from early Sumer, were named &quot;lasimu&quot; as military men as well as the king&#x27;s officials who disseminated documents throughout the kingdom by running. Ancient Greece was famous for its running messengers, who were named &quot;hemerodromoi&quot;, meaning &quot;day runners&quot;. One of the most famous running messengers is Pheidippides, who according to the legend ran from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory of the Greek over the Persians in the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C. He collapsed and died as he delivered the message &quot;we won&quot;. While there are debates around the accuracy of this historical legend, whether Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens or between other cities, how far this was, and if he was the one to deliver the victory message, the marathon running event of 26.2 miles / 42.195 km is based on this legend.

===Competition===
Typical long-distance track races range from 3000 metres (1.87 miles) to 10,000 metres (6.2 miles), cross country races usually cover 5 to 12 km (3 to 7 miles), while road races can be significantly longer, reaching and beyond. In collegiate cross-country races in the United States, men race 8,000 or 10,000 meters, depending on their division, whereas women race 6,000 meters. The Summer Olympics features four long-distance running events: the 3000 metres steeplechase (which also involves jumping over barriers and water), the 5000 metres, 10,000 metres and marathon (42.195 kilometres, or 26 miles and 385 yards).

==Physiology==
Humans have been considered among the best distance runners among all running animals: game animals are faster over short distances, but they have less endurance than humans. Unlike other primates whose bodies are suited to walk on four legs or climb trees, the human body has evolved into upright walking and running around 2-3 million years ago. The human body can endure long-distance running through the following attributes:
# Bone and muscle structure: unlike quadruped mammals, which have their center of mass in front of the hind legs or limbs, in biped mammals including humans the center of mass lies right above the legs. This leads to different bone and muscular demands, especially in the legs and pelvis.
# Dissipation of metabolic heat: humans&#x27; ability to cool the body by sweating through the body surface provides many advantages over panting through the mouth or nose. These include a larger surface of evaporation and independence of the respiratory cycle.
# Increased tendon length: when compared to extant quadrupedal relatives, humans maintain longer more spring-like tendons. This allows for more efficient locomotion over flat ground using the increased energy storing capabilities of these tendon tissues.
One distinction between upright walking and running is energy consumption during locomotion. While walking, humans use about half the energy needed to run.

===Factors===
==== Aerobic capacity ====
One&#x27;s aerobic capacity or VO2Max is the ability to maximally take up and consume oxygen during exhaustive exercise. Long-distance runners typically perform at around 75–85% of peak aerobic capacity, while short-distance runners perform at closer to 100% of peak.

Aerobic capacity depends on the transportation of large amounts of blood to and from the lungs to reach all tissues. This in turn is dependent on having a high cardiac output, sufficient levels of hemoglobin in blood and an optimal vascular system to distribute blood. A 20-fold increase of local blood flow within the skeletal muscle is necessary for endurance athletes, like marathon runners, to meet their muscles&#x27; oxygen demands at maximal exercise that are up to 50 times greater than at rest.

Elite long-distance runners often have larger hearts and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner&#x27;s aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever-decreasing heart rate.

The amount of oxygen that blood can carry depends on blood volume, which increases during a race, and the amount of hemoglobin in the blood.

Other physiological factors affecting a marathon runner&#x27;s aerobic capacity include pulmonary diffusion, mitochondria enzyme activity, and capillary density.

A long-distance runner&#x27;s running economy is their steady state requirement for oxygen at specific speeds and helps explain differences in performance for runners with very similar aerobic capacities. This is often measured by the volume of oxygen consumed, either in liters or milliliters, per kilogram of body weight per minute (L/kg/min or mL/kg/min). the physiological basis for this was uncertain, but it seemed to depend on the cumulative years of running and reaches a cap that longer individual training sessions cannot overcome.

==== Lactate threshold ====
A long-distance runner&#x27;s velocity at the lactate threshold is strongly correlated to their performance. The lactate threshold is the cross-over point between predominantly aerobic energy usage and anaerobic energy usage and is considered a good indicator of the body&#x27;s ability to efficiently process and transfer chemical energy into mechanical energy. For most runners, the aerobic zone does not begin until around 120 heartbeats per minute. Lactate threshold training involves tempo workouts that are meant to build strength and speed, rather than improve the cardiovascular system&#x27;s efficiency in absorbing and transporting oxygen. By running at your lactate threshold, your body will become more efficient at clearing lactate and reusing it to fuel your muscles. Uncertainty exists in regard to how lactate threshold affects endurance performance.

==== Fuel ====
In order to sustain high-intensity running, a marathon runner must obtain sufficient glycogen stores. Glycogen can be found in the skeletal muscles and liver. With low levels of glycogen stores at the onset of the marathon, premature depletion of these stores can reduce performance or even prevent the completion of the race. ATP production via aerobic pathways can further be limited by glycogen depletion. Free Fatty Acids serve as a sparing mechanism for glycogen stores. The artificial elevation of these fatty acids along with endurance training demonstrates a marathon runner&#x27;s ability to sustain higher intensities for longer periods of time. The prolonged sustenance of running intensity is attributed to a high turnover rate of fatty acids that allows the runner to preserve glycogen stores later into the race.

Long-distance runners generally practice carbohydrate loading in their training and race preparation.

==== Thermoregulation and body fluid loss ====
The maintenance of core body temperature is crucial to a marathon runner&#x27;s performance and health. An inability to reduce rising core body temperature can lead to hyperthermia. In order to reduce body heat, the metabolically produced heat needs to be removed from the body via sweating, which in turn requires rehydration to compensate for. Replacement of fluid is limited but can help keep the body&#x27;s internal temperatures cooler. Fluid replacement is physiologically challenging during the exercise of this intensity due to the inefficient emptying of the stomach. Partial fluid replacement can serve to avoid a marathon runner&#x27;s body overheating but not enough to keep pace with the loss of fluid via sweat evaporation. Environmental factors can especially complicate heat regulation.

====Altitude====
Since the late 1980s, Kenyans, Moroccans, and Ethiopians have dominated in major international long-distance competitions. The high altitude of these countries has been proven to help these runners achieve more success. High altitude, combined with endurance training, can lead to an increase in red blood cells, allowing increased oxygen delivery via arteries. The majority of these East African successful runners come from three mountain districts that run along the Great Rift Valley. While altitude may be a contributing factor, a culture of hard work, teamwork, as well as an advanced institutional structure also contributes to their success.

=== Impact on health ===
&quot;… an evolutionary perspective indicates that we did not evolve to run long distances at fast speeds on a regular basis. As a result, it is unlikely there was a selection for the human body to cope with some of the extreme demands runners place on their bodies.&quot;
The impact of long-distance running on human health is generally positive. Various organs and systems in the human body are improved: bone mineral density is increased, and cholesterol is lowered.

However, beyond a certain point, negative consequences might occur. Older male runners (45-55) who run more than per week face reduced testosterone levels, although they are still in the normal range. Running a marathon lowers testosterone levels by 50% in men and more than doubles cortisol levels for 24 hours. Low testosterone is thought to be a physiological adaptation to the sport, as excess muscle caused may be shed through lower testosterone, yielding a more efficient runner. Veteran, lifelong endurance athletes have been found to have more heart scarring than control groups, but replication studies and larger studies should be done to firmly establish the link, which may or may not be causal. Some studies find that running more than per week yields no lower risk for all-cause mortality than non-runners, although these studies are in conflict with large studies that show longer lifespans for any increase in exercise volume.

Elite-level long-distance running is associated with a three to seven times higher risk of the knee osteoarthritis later in life compared to non-runners.

The effectiveness of shoe inserts has been contested. Memory foam and similar shoe inserts may be comfortable, but they can make foot muscles weaker in the long term. Running shoes with special features, or lack thereof in the case of minimalist designs, do not prevent injury. Rather, comfortable shoes and standard running styles are safer.

==In sport==

Many sporting activities feature significant levels of running under prolonged periods of play, especially during ball sports like association football and rugby league. However, continuous endurance running is exclusively found in racing sports. Most of these are individual sports, although team and relay forms also exist.

The most prominent long-distance running sports are grouped within the sport of athletics, where running competitions are held on strictly defined courses, and the fastest runner to complete the distance wins. The foremost types are long-distance track running, road running and cross-country running. Other less popular variants such as fell running, trail running, mountain running, and tower running combine the challenge of distance with a significant incline or change of elevation as part of the course.

Multisport races frequently include endurance running. Triathlon, as defined by the International Triathlon Union, may feature running sections ranging from to the marathon distance (42.195 kilometres, or 26 miles and 385 yards), depending on the race type. The related sport of duathlon is a combination of cycling and distance running. Previous versions of the modern pentathlon incorporated a three or four-kilometre (1.9–2.5 mi) run, but changes to the official rules in 2008 meant the running sections are now divided into three separate legs of one kilometre each (0.6 mi).

Depending on the rules and terrain, navigation sports such as foot orienteering and rogaining may contain periods of endurance running within the competition. Variants of adventure racing may also combine navigational skills and endurance running in this manner.

===Running competitions===
====Track running====

The history of long-distance track running events are tied to the track and field stadia where they are held. Oval circuits allow athletes to cover long distances in a confined area. Early tracks were usually on flattened earth or were simply marked areas of grass. The style of running tracks became refined during the 20th century: the oval running tracks were standardised to 400 metres in distance and cinder tracks were replaced by synthetic all-weather running track of asphalt and rubber from the mid-1960s onwards. It was not until the 1912 Stockholm Olympics that the standard long-distance track events of 5000 metres and 10,000 metres were introduced.
* The 3000 metres steeplechase is a race that involves not only running but also jumping over barriers and a water pit. While it can be considered a hurdling event, it is also widely regarded as a long-distance running event as well. The obstacles for the men are high, and for the women .
** The world record for men is 7:53.63 by Saif Saaeed Shaheen of Qatar in Brussels, Belgium set on 3 September 2004.
** The world record for women is 8:44.32 by Beatrice Chepkoech of Kenya in Monaco, set on 20 July 2018.
* The 5000 metres is a premier event that requires tactics and superior aerobic conditioning. Training for such an event may consist of a total of a week, although training regimens vary greatly. The 5000 is often a popular entry-level race for beginning runners.
** The world record for men is 12:35.36 (an average of 23.83 km/h) by Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda in Monaco set on 14 August 2020
** The world record for women is 14:00.21 (an average of 21.43 km/h) by Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia in Oregon, United States set on 17 September 2023
* The 10,000 metres is the longest standard track event. Most of those running such races also compete in road races and cross country running events.
** The world record for men is 26:11.00 (22.915 km/h) by Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda in Valencia, Spain set on 7 October 2020
** The world record for women is 29:01.03 by Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia set on 8 June 2021.
* The One hour run is an endurance race that is rarely contested, except in pursuit of world records.
* The 20,000 metres is also rarely contested, most world records in the 20,000 metres have been set while in a one-hour run race.

====Road running====


Long-distance road running competitions are mainly conducted on courses of paved or tarmac roads, although major events often finish on the track of a main stadium. In addition to being a common recreational sport, the elite level of the sport – particularly marathon races – is one of the most popular aspects of athletics. Road racing events can be of virtually any distance, but the most common and well-known is the marathon, half marathon, and 10 km run.

The sport of road running finds its roots in the activities of footmen: male servants who ran alongside the carriages of aristocrats around the 18th century, and who also ran errands over distances for their masters. Foot racing competitions evolved from wagers between aristocrats, who pitted their footman against that of another aristocrat in order to determine a winner. The sport became professionalised as footmen were hired specifically on their athletic ability and began to devote their lives to training for gambling events. The amateur sports movement in the late 19th century marginalised competitions based on the professional, gambling model. The 1896 Summer Olympics saw the birth of the modern marathon and the event led to the growth of road running competitions through annual public events such as the Boston Marathon (first held in 1897) and the Lake Biwa Marathon and Fukuoka Marathons, which were established in the 1940s. The 1970s running boom in the United States made road running a common pastime and also increased its popularity at the elite level.

The marathon is the only road running event featured at the World Athletics Championships and the Summer Olympics, although there is also the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships held every two years. The marathon is also the only road running event featured at the World Para Athletics Championships and the Summer Paralympics. The World Marathon Majors series includes the six most prestigious marathon competitions at the elite level – the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, Tokyo, and New York City marathons. The Tokyo Marathon was most recently added to the World Marathon Majors in 2012.

Ekiden contests – which originated in Japan and remain common there – are a relay race variation on the marathon, in contrast to the typically individual sport of road running.

====Cross country running====

Cross-country running is the most naturalistic form of long-distance running in athletics as competitions take place on open-air courses over surfaces such as grass, woodland trails, earth, or mountains. In contrast to the relatively flat courses in track and road races, cross country usually incorporates obstacles such as muddy sections, logs, and mounds of earth. As a result of these factors, weather can play an integral role in racing conditions. Cross country is both an individual and team sport, as runners are judged on an individual basis and a points-scoring method is used for teams. Competitions are typically races of or more which are usually held in autumn and winter. Cross country&#x27;s most successful athletes often compete in long-distance track and road events as well.

The history of the sport is linked with the game of paper chase, or hare and hounds, where a group of runners would cover long distances to chase a leading runner, who left a trail of paper to follow. The Crick Run in England in 1838 was the first recorded instance of an organised cross-country competition. The sport gained popularity in British, then American schools in the 19th century and culminated in the creation of the first International Cross Country Championships in 1903. The annual World Athletics Cross Country Championships was inaugurated in 1973 and this remains the highest level of competition for the sport. A number of continental cross country competitions are held, with championships taking place in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America and South America. The sport has retained its status at the scholastic level, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. At the professional level, the foremost competitions come under the banner of the World Athletics Cross Country Tour.

While cross country competitions are no longer held at the Olympics, having featured in the athletics programme from 1912 to 1924, it has been present as one of the events within the modern pentathlon competition since the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Fell running, trail running, and mountain running can all be considered variations on the traditional cross country which incorporate significant uphill and/or downhill sections as an additional challenge to the course.

==Adventure running==
The term adventure running is loosely defined and can be used to describe any form of long-distance running in a natural setting, regardless of the running surface. It may include river crossing, scrambling, snow, extremely high or low temperatures, and high altitudes. It has both competitive and non-competitive forms, the latter being for individual recreation or social experience. As a result, courses are often set in scenic locations and feature obstacles designed to give participants a sense of achievement. It bears similarities to running sections of adventure racing.

==Ultra-long distance: extended events and achievements==

A number of events, records, and achievements exist for long-distance running, outside the context of track and field sports events. These include multiday races, ultramarathons, and long-distance races in extreme conditions or measuring hundreds or thousands of miles.

Beyond these, records and stand-alone achievements, rather than regular events, exist for individuals who have achieved running goals of a unique nature, such as running across or around continents &quot;(see lists of runners: America, Australia)&quot; or running around the world.

<text>The Château de Brissac is a French château in the Brissac-Quincé area of the commune of Brissac Loire Aubance, located in the department of Maine-et-Loire, France. The property is owned by the noble Cossé family, whose head bears the French hereditary title of Duke of Brissac. The château is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

==History==

The château was originally built as a castle by the Counts of Anjou in the 11th century. After the victory over the English by King Philip II of France, he gave the property to Guillaume des Roches. In the 15th century, the structure was rebuilt by Pierre de Brézé, a wealthy chief minister to King Charles VII of France. During the reign (1515–47) of King Francis I, the property was acquired by René de Cossé, who was named by the King as governor of Anjou and Maine.

During the French Wars of Religion, the château was made a possession in 1589 by the Protestant leader, Henry of Navarre. Severely damaged, the fortress was scheduled to be demolished. However, Charles II de Cossé sided with Henry of Navarre, who soon was crowned King of France. In gratitude, King Henry gave him the property, the noble title of Duke of Brissac and the money to rebuild the château in 1611.

Its construction made it the tallest château in France, and its façade reflects the influences of the 17th century&#x27;s Baroque architecture. Through marriage, the Cossé-Brissac family also acquired the Château Montreuil-Bellay but later sold it.

In August 1620, King Louis XIII and his mother, Marie de Medici, met to discuss their differences in the &quot;neutral&quot; territory of the Château de Brissac. A temporary truce between the two was reached. Still, it did not last long, and the Queen Mother was eventually banished.

The descendants of the first Duke of Brissac maintained the château until 1792 when the property was ransacked during the French Revolution. It lay in waste until a restoration program began in 1844 and was carried on by subsequent Dukes of Brissac.

==The château today==

Today, the Château de Brissac is still owned by the Cossé-Brissac family. The property is currently managed by Charles-André de Cossé-Brissac, 14th Duke of Brissac (b. 1962), who is the elder son of François de Cossé-Brissac, 13th Duke of Brissac (1929–2021).

The château has seven stories altogether, making it the tallest château in the Loire Valley. The château is open to the public for tours and overnight stays in its guest rooms, and the luxurious gilded theatre hosts the annual Val de Loire festival. It was also used until recently as a location for the Brazilian celebrity magazine &quot;Caras&quot;.

==In popular culture==

During the mid-1990s, the château was prominently featured as the temporary stadium for the Iron Chef French Battles of the original Japanese &quot;Iron Chef&quot; television show. Two battles were staged at the Château de Brissac and aired in Japan on April 12, 1996. The first battle, with the theme ingredient salmon, was between Bernard Leprince and Iron Chef Japanese Koumei Nakamura, and it was won by Leprince. At the time, Leprince was the chef at La Tour d&#x27;Argent in Paris. The second battle was between Pierre Gagnaire and Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai, with the theme ingredient lobster, and it was won by Gagnaire.

The château was also featured in the Japanese visual novel version of &quot;Fate/Stay Night&quot;.

<doc id="89289" wikidata="Q732383" url="?curid=89289" title="Yes Minister">
<text>Yes Minister is a British political satire sitcom written by Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn. Comprising three seven-episode series, it was first transmitted on BBC2 from 1980 to 1984. A sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, ran for 16 episodes from 1986 to 1988. All but one of the episodes lasted half an hour, and almost all ended with a variation of the title of the series spoken as the answer to a question posed by Minister (later, Prime Minister) Jim Hacker. Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio; the series also spawned a 2010 stage play that led to a new television series on Gold in 2013.

Set principally in the private office of a British cabinet minister in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall, &quot;Yes Minister&quot; follows the ministerial career of Jim Hacker, played by Paul Eddington. His various struggles to formulate and enact policy or affect departmental changes are opposed by the British Civil Service, in particular his Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, played by Nigel Hawthorne. His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley, played by Derek Fowlds, is usually caught between the two. The sequel, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, continued with the same cast and followed Hacker after his unexpected elevation to prime ministerial office.

The series received several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll. It was the favourite television programme of Margaret Thatcher, the then-British prime minister.

==Plot==
The series opens in the wake of a general election in which the incumbent government has been defeated by the opposition party, to which Jim Hacker MP belongs. His party affiliation is never stated, his party emblem is clearly neither Conservative nor Labour, and his party&#x27;s political colour is white. The Prime Minister offers Hacker the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs, which he accepts. Hacker goes to his department and meets his Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, and Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley.

While Appleby is outwardly deferential towards the new minister, he is prepared to defend the status quo at all costs. Hacker and his party&#x27;s policies of reducing bureaucracy are diametrically opposed to the Civil Service&#x27;s interests, in which staff numbers and budgets are viewed as merits of success (i.e. the more funding or staffing a department gets, the more successful it is considered). Woolley is sympathetic towards Hacker but as Appleby reminds him, Woolley&#x27;s civil service superiors, including Appleby, will have much to say about the course of his future career, while ministers do not usually stay long in one department and have no say in civil service staffing recommendations.

Many of the episodes revolve around proposals backed by Hacker but frustrated by Appleby, who uses a range of clever stratagems to defeat ministerial proposals while seeming to support them. Other episodes revolve around proposals promoted by Appleby but rejected by Hacker, which Appleby attempts by all means necessary to persuade Hacker to accept. They do occasionally join forces in order to achieve a common goal, such as preventing the closure of their department or dealing with a diplomatic incident.

As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government, most of the scenes take place in private locations, such as offices and exclusive members&#x27; clubs. Lynn said that &quot;there was not a single scene set in the House of Commons because government does not take place in the House of Commons. Some politics and much theatre takes place there. Government happens in private. As in all public performances, the real work is done in rehearsal, behind closed doors. Then the public and the House are shown what the government wishes them to see.&quot; However, the episode &quot;The Compassionate Society&quot; does feature an audio recording of &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; in which Hacker speaks in the House of Commons, and other episodes include scenes in the Foreign Secretary&#x27;s House of Commons office (&quot;The Writing on the Wall&quot;) and a Committee room (&quot;A Question of Loyalty&quot;).

The fictional Department of Administrative Affairs is the focus of the series. In &quot;The Skeleton in the Cupboard&quot;, Woolley mentions that the DAA was founded in 1964 alongside the Department of Economic Affairs (the chief inspiration for the DAA). In &quot;Open Government&quot;, the Department was referred to as a &#x27;political graveyard&#x27;, with Hacker&#x27;s appointment as Minister of Administrative Affairs likely being punishment for managing the leadership campaign against the new Prime Minister. In &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Hacker reaches out to his predecessor in the previous government Tom Sargant, for help to overcome Civil Service resistance to the introduction of safeguards for the National Integrated Database, to which Sargent outlined the Civil Service&#x27;s five step stalling technique and reveals the existence of a White Paper. Being responsible for overseeing the administration of other government departments, government archives, the purchase of office equipment and the enactment of EEC directives, it serves as a vehicle to explore different political themes, such as foreign policy, education, the environment, health, defence, Europe, international trade, local government, and national security. In &quot;The Death List&quot;, the DAA is mentioned as being responsible for the government&#x27;s surveillance equipment. The DAA has gained other responsibilities through departmental reshuffles, namely the arts (albeit to prevent Hacker from closing down an art gallery in his constituency to save a local football team from bankruptcy). The DAA has also been given responsibility for enacting policies or programmes which no other department would want to deal with due to their unpopularity or any other fallout, such as in &quot;The Bed of Nails&quot; when Hacker was made Transport Supremo and given responsibility for an Integrated Transport programme as the Department of Transport did not want to incur the wroth of any disadvantaged sector.

==Characters==
===Jim Hacker===

The Right Honourable Jim Hacker MP (Paul Eddington), eventually elevated to the House of Lords as Lord Hacker of Islington, was the editor of a newspaper called &quot;Reform&quot; before going into politics. He spent a good deal of time in Parliament on the Opposition benches before his party won a general election, including serving as the Shadow Secretary for Agriculture. In &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, he is the Minister for Administrative Affairs (a fictitious ministry of the British government) and a cabinet minister, and in &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; he becomes the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Hacker received his degree from the London School of Economics (graduating with a Third), for which he is often derided by the Oxford-educated Sir Humphrey (who attended &quot;Baillie College&quot;, a thinly-veiled reference to the real Balliol College, graduating with a First in Classics). His early character is that of a gung-ho, but naïve, politician, bringing sweeping changes to his department. Before long, Hacker begins to notice that Civil Service tactics are preventing his planned changes being put into practice. As he learns, he becomes more sly and cynical, using some of the Civil Service ruses himself. While Sir Humphrey initially held all the aces, Hacker now and again plays a trump card of his own and thus scores the occasional victory over Sir Humphrey.

Throughout &quot;Yes Minister,&quot; Hacker, at his worst, is portrayed as a publicity-seeking bungler who is incapable of making a firm decision. He is prone to potentially embarrassing blunders, and is a frequent target of criticism from the press and stern lectures from the Chief Whip. However, he is also shown to be relatively politically savvy, and he slowly becomes more aware of Sir Humphrey&#x27;s real agenda. In &quot;Yes, Prime Minister,&quot; Hacker becomes more statesmanlike. He practises more grandiose speeches, dreams up his &quot;Grand Design&quot; and hones his diplomatic skills. Nearly all of these efforts land him in trouble. In a &quot;Radio Times&quot; interview to promote &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, Paul Eddington stated, &quot;He&#x27;s beginning to find his feet as a man of power, and he&#x27;s begun to confound those who thought they&#x27;d be able to manipulate him out of hand.&quot;

===Sir Humphrey Appleby===
Sir Humphrey Appleby (Nigel Hawthorne) serves throughout the series as permanent secretary under his minister, Jim Hacker at the Department of Administrative Affairs. He is appointed Cabinet Secretary just as Hacker&#x27;s party enters a leadership crisis, and is instrumental in Hacker&#x27;s elevation to Prime Minister. He is committed to maintaining the &quot;status quo&quot; for the country in general and for the Civil Service in particular. Sir Humphrey is a master of obfuscation and manipulation, baffling his opponents with long-winded technical jargon and circumlocutions, strategically appointing allies to supposedly impartial boards, and setting up interdepartmental committees to smother his minister&#x27;s proposals in red tape. However, although presenting an outward appearance of supreme confidence and competence, Sir Humphrey is not immune to making miscalculations or outright blunders. When such blunders occur, he relies on the Civil Service bureaucracy to save him.

In &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, Stephen Fry comments that &quot;we love the idea of the coherence and articulacy of Sir Humphrey ... it&#x27;s one of the things you look forward to in an episode of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; ... when&#x27;s the big speech going to happen? And can I see if he&#x27;s reading it from an idiot board ... he&#x27;s really learned it, and it&#x27;s superb.&quot; Derek Fowlds posited to a concerned Eddington that these speeches were the reason why Hawthorne won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Performance four times in a row, while Eddington, though nominated, did not win at all.

Loquacious and verbose, he frequently uses both his mastery of the English language and his grasp of Latin and Greek grammar both to perplex his political master and to obscure the relevant issues. In a &quot;Radio Times&quot; interview to promote the second series of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, producer Sydney Lotterby said that he always tried to give Eddington and Hawthorne extra time to rehearse as their scenes invariably featured lengthy dialogue exchanges.

===Bernard Woolley===
Bernard Woolley, MA (Oxon) (Derek Fowlds) is Jim Hacker&#x27;s Principal Private Secretary. His loyalties are often split between his Minister and his Civil Service boss, Sir Humphrey. Whilst in theory he is personally responsible to Hacker, in practice it is Sir Humphrey who writes his performance reviews and influences his Civil Service career. He usually handles these situations well, and maintains his reputation in the Civil Service as a &quot;high flier&quot; as opposed to a &quot;low flier supported by occasional gusts of wind.&quot;

Woolley is always quick to point out the physical impossibilities of Sir Humphrey&#x27;s or Hacker&#x27;s mixed metaphors, with almost obsessive pedantry. He can occasionally appear rather childlike, by making animal noises and gestures or by acting out how such an analogy cannot work, which sometimes annoys his Minister. Woolley tends to side with Hacker when new policies are announced, because they seem radical or democratic, only for Sir Humphrey to point out the disadvantages to the status quo and the civil service in particular. To sway Bernard, Sir Humphrey uses phrases such as &quot;barbarism&quot; and &quot;the beginning of the end&quot;. At times when Sir Humphrey fails to get his way, Woolley can be seen smiling smugly at him over his defeat. As Hacker awaits confirmation of his elevation to Prime Minister, he asks Woolley to join him in Downing Street as his principal private secretary, which Sir Humphrey endorses, thus keeping the trio together.

In a 2004 retrospective, Armando Iannucci commented that Fowlds had a difficult task because he had to &quot;spend most of his time saying nothing but looking interested in everyone else&#x27;s total and utter guff&quot; but &quot;his one line frequently had to be the funniest of the lot.&quot; Iannucci suggests that Woolley is essential to the structure of the show because both Hacker and Appleby confide in him, &quot;which means we get to find out what they&#x27;re plotting next.&quot;

The editor&#x27;s note to &quot;The Complete Yes Prime Minister&quot; (supposedly published in 2024 after Hacker&#x27;s death but actually published by the BBC in 1989), thanks &quot;Sir Bernard Woolley, GCB&quot; for his help and confirms that he did indeed make it to the position of Head of the Civil Service.

===Other recurring characters===
The series featured a cast of recurring characters. 
* Frank Weisel (often deprecatingly pronounced &quot;weasel&quot;) — played by Neil Fitzwiliam in the television series, whereas he is voiced by Bill Nighy in the radio series adaptations — is Hacker&#x27;s crusading, idealistic political advisor in the first series. The less scrupulous Hacker finds him rather tiresome after a time, while Sir Humphrey finds him positively loathsome from the outset. In the final scene of the last episode of the first series, Weisel is sent on a deliberately lengthy worldwide fact-finding assignment to learn about quangos to ensure a set of politically face-saving quango appointments and to prevent his publication of a quango reform white paper. He is not mentioned in any later series.
* Dorothy Wainwright, special advisor to the Prime Minister, played by Deborah Norton. Wainwright is rather more down-to-earth than Weisel, and rarely takes the bait when provoked. Also unlike Weisel, she knows Sir Humphrey&#x27;s tricks and is able to give the Prime Minister instant and practical advice how to get past his manipulations. Sir Humphrey is aware of this and sees her as a threat rather than an irritant. He usually condescendingly addresses her as &quot;Dear Lady&quot;, rather than using her name. Earlier Prime Ministerial advisors had appeared from time to time in episodes of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, including Daniel Moynihan as Daniel Hughes in &quot;The Writing on the Wall&quot; (1980) and Nigel Stock as Sir Mark Spencer in &quot;Bed of Nails&quot; (1982). In the later stage play and 2013 television revival, Hacker&#x27;s young advisor, Claire Sutton, had a larger role than any of her predecessors.
* Hacker also has a Press Secretary, Bill Pritchard, played by Antony Carrick. Pritchard is seen a total of five widely spaced episodes, spanning the run of both series. A second Press Secretary, Malcolm Warren (played by Barry Stanton), appears in two episodes of the first series of &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot;.

Meanwhile, Sir Humphrey&#x27;s Civil Service colleagues were also regularly featured. They include:
* Sir Arnold Robinson (played by John Nettleton), Cabinet Secretary in &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and later (after his retirement from the civil service) President of the Campaign for Freedom of Information in &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. The reserved, dignified Sir Arnold is a master manipulator, to whom Sir Humphrey often turns for counsel, even after he retires and has no reason to frequent Whitehall any more. In many ways, Sir Arnold acts as a mentor to Sir Humphrey, especially as the two men are evidently of the same social class and share many of the same political views and support the idea that it is really the Civil Service running the government, rather than the Ministers themselves. Like Sir Humphrey, he is also seen wearing the tie of Balliol College, Oxford.
* Sir Frederick Stewart (played by John Savident in the television series, whereas he is voiced by Peter Cellier in the radio series adaptations), Permanent Secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, known as &quot;Jumbo&quot; to his friends. A friendly confidant of Sir Humphrey, but seen only during the first series.
* Sir Ian Whitchurch (played by John Barron), Permanent Secretary to the Department of Health and Social Security.
* Sir Richard Wharton (played by Donald Pickering), a later Permanent Secretary to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It is not known whether or not he replaced Jumbo directly.
* Sir Frank Gordon, who appears in both &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; as Permanent Secretary to the Treasury (played by Peter Cellier). Perhaps the one civil servant Sir Humphrey finds a genuine threat to his own career ambitions, Sir Frank is a smooth, confident, well-mannered manipulator out for his own ends.
* Sir Humphrey also has an old acquaintance, Sir Desmond Glazebrook (played by Richard Vernon), who is Board member, then chairman, of Bartlett&#x27;s Bank. Glazebrook is an amiably vague fellow of impeccable respectability, very little actual financial knowledge, and no fixed opinions on anything. Hacker appointed him Governor of the Bank of England in the &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; episode &quot;A Conflict of Interest&quot;, in order to avoid a financial collapse of the City.

Hacker&#x27;s family:
* His wife, Annie Hacker (played by Diana Hoddinott), who appears in multiple episodes on both series.
* His daughter, Lucy (played by Gerry Cowper), who only appears on-screen in one episode (&quot;The Right to Know&quot;) as an environmental campaigner, but who is mentioned intermittently throughout. By the time of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, she is a student at the University of Sussex (which Hacker likens to a kibbutz).
* In &quot;Party Games&quot;, Hacker implies that he and Annie have more than one child, though there is no mention of this anywhere else.

Others:
* Lady Appleby, Sir Humphrey&#x27;s wife, is mentioned on occasion, seen only briefly from behind (in an uncredited, non-speaking appearance) in &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and never given a first name.
* Various Chief Whips, usually acting in &quot;Yes Minister&quot; as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; to the unseen Prime Minister. The first Chief Whip, Vic Gould, was played by Edward Jewesbury in two episodes of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. Gould was initially intended to be a more prominent character in the series, as the writers thought he would continually force Hacker to pursue policies unappealing to Sir Humphrey, and thus lead to greater conflict. They quickly found that Gould&#x27;s character was largely unnecessary, and that the Hacker/Sir Humphrey conflicts worked just as well without him. In &quot;Party Games&quot;, a later Chief Whip, played by James Grout and identified as &quot;Jeffrey&quot;, conspires with Sir Humphrey to ensure that Hacker becomes Prime Minister. In 2 episodes of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, Jeffrey is now played by Peter Cartwright. (In the novelizations, the character is given the full name of Jeffrey Pearson.) Jeffrey is clueless about an alleged Cabinet plot against the Prime Minister ... because there is none, and Hacker is pursuing a false trail laid by Sir Humphrey. 
* Hacker&#x27;s chauffeur, George (Arthur Cox), appeared in five episodes. He is a character who is always more in touch with current events than is the Minister — anything from empty NHS hospitals to Cabinet reshuffles. This often irritates Hacker who, when he asks George where the information came from, is usually told that it is common knowledge among the Whitehall drivers.
* Tom Sargent (Robert Urquhart), Hacker&#x27;s predecessor as Minister for Administrative Affairs in the previous government, made one appearance in the episode &quot;Big Brother&quot;. He told Hacker about the Civil Service&#x27;s five-step stalling technique and a white paper drafted for the introduction of safeguards for an integrated government database.
* Basil Corbett is a rival politician who, though he is not seen, is central to the plot of &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;. In a Cabinet reshuffle, Sir Humphrey feared that he would replace Hacker as Minister for Administrative Affairs.
* Dr. Richard Cartwright (played by Ian Lavender) is a civil service under-secretary in the Department for Administrative Affairs who shows a great expertise in the affairs of local government, and shares that expertise with Hacker—much to Sir Humphrey&#x27;s displeasure. Hacker seeks out Cartwright&#x27;s advice directly in &quot;The Challenge&quot; and &quot;The Skeleton in the Cupboard&quot;, with such potentially disastrous consequences (at least for Sir Humphrey) that Sir Humphrey hints at Cartwright&#x27;s being moved to another job as a result.
* Eileen (Miranda Forbes) is a secretary in Sir Humphrey&#x27;s office, usually seen ushering guests in. She is seen in four episodes of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. 
* Well-known broadcasters who played themselves included Robert McKenzie, Ludovic Kennedy and Sue Lawley. Robert Dougall regularly played a newsreader, which was his own real-life profession. Among other newscasters, Nicholas Witchell can be heard reporting on Hacker&#x27;s visit to a school in &quot;The National Education Service&quot; and Sophie Raworth is seen on television in the 2013 revival.

==Production==
===Politics===
Lynn joined the Cambridge Union in his first year at the University of Cambridge because he thought that he might like to enter politics. &quot;All of the main debaters there, aged 20, were the most pompous, self-satisfied, self-important bunch of clowns that I&#x27;ve ever clapped eyes on. They were all behaving as if they were on the government front bench, and 20 years later they all were: Michael Howard; John Selwyn Gummer; Kenneth Clarke. I thought at that point that the only way that I could ever contribute to politics is making fun of the politicians.&quot;

The series, then, intended to satirise politics and government in general, rather than any specific party. The writers placed Hacker at the centre of the political spectrum, and were careful to identify his party headquarters as &quot;Central House&quot; (a combination of Conservative Central Office and Labour&#x27;s Transport House). The terms &quot;Labour&quot; and &quot;Conservative&quot; are scrupulously avoided throughout the series, favouring terms such as &quot;the party&quot; or &quot;the government&quot; and &quot;the opposition&quot;. In the first scene of the first episode, &quot;Open Government&quot;, Hacker is shown at the declaration of his constituency result wearing a white rosette, with other candidates sporting the red and blue rosettes associated with the two leading British parties. The one exception to this neutrality occurs very briefly in &quot;The National Education Service&quot;, when Sir Humphrey explains to Bernard how the policy of comprehensive education is retained through successive governments, using different arguments according to which party is in power. Even there, Humphrey does not reveal which party Jim Hacker represents. Despite this, the overall thrust was towards government reduction rather than expansion. The episode &quot;Jobs for the Boys&quot;, for example, rejected corporatism. Throughout the period of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot; the incumbent government of the United Kingdom was Conservative with the government led by Margaret Thatcher (although the pilot was produced before she came to power). Hacker&#x27;s predecessor as Prime Minister was unseen and unnamed, but established as male.

In a 2004 documentary, Armando Iannucci compared &quot;Yes Minister&quot; to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; in how it has influenced the public&#x27;s view of the state. Although Lynn comments that the word &quot;spin&quot; has &quot;probably entered the political vocabulary since the series,&quot; Iannucci suggests that the show &quot;taught us how to unpick the verbal tricks that politicians think they can get away with in front of the cameras.&quot; The series depicted the media-consciousness of politicians, reflecting the public relations training they undergo to help them deal with interviews and reading from autocue effectively. This is particularly evident in the episode &quot;The Ministerial Broadcast&quot;, in which Hacker is advised on the effects of his clothes and surroundings. The episode &quot;A Conflict of Interest&quot; humorously lampoons the various political stances of Britain&#x27;s newspapers through their readers (although this material was not original):

Adam Curtis, in his three-part TV documentary &quot;The Trap&quot;, criticised the series as &quot;ideological propaganda for a political movement&quot;, and claimed that &quot;Yes Minister&quot; is indicative of a larger movement of criticism of government and bureaucracy, centred upon public choice economics. Jay himself supported this: 
Jay, however, has elsewhere emphasized that he and Lynn were interested first and foremost in the comical possibilities present in government and bureaucracy and that they were not seeking to promote any agenda: &quot;Our only firm belief on the subject was that the underlying conflicts between ministers and ministries were better brought out into the open than kept secret&quot;.

===Inspirations===
The writers were inspired by a variety of sources, including sources inside government, published material and contemporary news stories. Jay has written that as early as 1965, he had been induced by developments in the Timothy Evans case to wonder about an &quot;inverted alchemy&quot; operating in Whitehall, capable of frustrating the most impassioned campaigner. The writers also met several leading senior civil servants under the auspices of the Royal Institute of Public Administration, a think-tank for the public service sector, which led to the development of some plot lines. Some situations were conceived as fiction, but were later revealed to have real-life counterparts. The episode &quot;The Compassionate Society&quot; depicts a hospital with 500 administrative staff but no doctors, nurses or patients. Lynn recalls that &quot;after inventing this absurdity, we discovered there were six such hospitals (or very large empty wings of hospitals) exactly as we had described them in our episode.&quot;

In a programme screened by the BBC in early 2004, paying tribute to the series, it was revealed that Jay and Lynn had drawn on information provided by two insiders from the governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, namely Marcia Falkender and Bernard Donoughue. The published diaries of Richard Crossman also provided inspiration. In particular the first of these describe his battles with &quot;the Dame&quot;, his Permanent Secretary, the formidable Baroness Sharp, the first woman in Britain to hold the position.

The episode entitled &quot;The Moral Dimension&quot;, in which Hacker and his staff engage in the scheme of secretly consuming alcohol on a trade mission to the fictional Islamic state of Qumran, was based on a real incident that took place in Pakistan, involving Callaghan and Donoughue, the latter of whom informed Jay and Lynn about the incident. Jay says that &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you where, I can&#x27;t tell you when and I can&#x27;t tell you who was involved; all I can tell you is that we knew that it had actually happened. That&#x27;s why it was so funny. We couldn&#x27;t think up things as funny as the real things that had happened.&quot; Media historian Andrew Crisell suggests that the show was &quot;enriched by the viewers&#x27; suspicion that what they were watching was unhealthily close to real life.&quot;

Fusing inspiration and invention, Lynn and Jay worked on the story &quot;for anything from three days to two weeks,&quot; and only took &quot;four mornings to write all the dialogue. After we wrote the episode, we would show it to some secret sources, always including somebody who was an expert on the subject in question. They would usually give us extra information which, because it was true, was usually funnier than anything we might have thought up.&quot; Designers Valerie Warrender and Gloria Clayton were given access to the Cabinet Rooms and the State Drawing Rooms. For security purposes, the arrangements of the rooms were altered, and the views from the windows were never shown, to conceal the layout of the buildings.

===Opening titles and music===

The opening titles were drawn by artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, who provided distinctive caricatures of Eddington, Hawthorne and Fowlds in their respective roles to represent distortion. He animated them as &#x27;self-drawing&#x27; by positioning the camera above his paper, adding parts of lines, and then photographing two frames at a time. The sequence ended with the title of the episode superimposed on a facsimile of an edition of the House of Commons &quot;Weekly Information Bulletin.&quot; Curiously, the legend &quot;Compiled in the Public Information Office of the House of Commons Library&quot; was left in the sequence. Scarfe created a second set of graphics for &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, including a different title card for each episode. Derek Fowlds wanted to buy an original drawing but was unable to afford it. The series&#x27; performance credits typically only featured those of the actors who appeared in the particular episode, not the names of characters. The typeface used in the credits is Plantin, a common typeface used in the British press at the time. The show title is set in bold condensed and the credits are in bold.

The theme music was composed by Ronnie Hazlehurst and is largely based on the Westminster Quarters: the chimes of Big Ben. When asked in an interview about its Westminster influence, Hazlehurst replied, &quot;That&#x27;s all it is. It&#x27;s the easiest thing I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; The theme has a strong similarity to that of &quot;To The Manor Born&quot;, which was also composed by Hazlehurst around the same time.

A substantially different set of titles and music were produced for the pilot episode, &quot;Open Government&quot;, which were never broadcast but appear on the DVD release. The pilot opening and closing title caption cards feature drawings of most of the cast, but far less exaggerated than those of Scarfe, while the music by Max Harris is a more up-tempo piece for brass band. When the pilot was aired as part of series 1, these were replaced by the familiar Scarfe and Hazlehurst credits.

===Writing===
The different ideals and self-interested motives of the characters are frequently contrasted. Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things, he ultimately sees his re-election and elevation to higher office as the key measures of his success. Accordingly, he must appear to the voters to be effective and responsive to the public will. To his party (and, in the first incarnation of the series, the Prime Minister) he must act as a loyal and effective party member. Sir Humphrey, on the other hand, genuinely believes that the Civil Service, being politically impartial, has the most realistic idea of what &quot;good governance&quot; means, and therefore knows what is best for the country – a belief shared by his bureaucratic colleagues.

Hacker sees the job of government as one of &quot;doing good&quot;, or more specifically reforming the country according to his own party&#x27;s policies: which, more often than not, means the initiation of departmental reforms and economies, a reduction of the level of bureaucracy and reduction of staff numbers in the Civil Service. To do so, or to at least look as if he is doing so, is what he considers to be a vote-winner. Conversely, Sir Humphrey sees his role as ensuring that politics is kept out of government as much as possible and that the &quot;status quo&quot; is upheld as a matter of principle. But with the &quot;status quo&quot; notably including the prestige, power and influence of the Civil Service, Sir Humphrey attempts to block any move that seeks either to prevent the further expansion of the civil service or to reduce the complexity of its bureaucracy.

Much of the show&#x27;s humour thus derives from the antagonism between Cabinet ministers (who believe they are in charge) and the members of the British Civil Service (who believe they really run the country). A typical episode centres on Hacker&#x27;s suggesting and pursuing a reform and Sir Humphrey&#x27;s blocking of all Hacker&#x27;s lines of approach. More often than not, Sir Humphrey prevents him from achieving his goal while mollifying Hacker with some positive publicity, or at least a means to cover up his failure. Occasionally, however, Hacker &quot;does&quot; get his way, often by thwarting other arrangements or deals that Sir Humphrey has been making behind the scenes elsewhere with other ministers or civil servants. In the case of the episodes &quot;The Skeleton in the Cupboard&quot; and &quot;The Tangled Web&quot;, Hacker manages to exploit embarrassing mistakes committed by Sir Humphrey; blackmailing him into adopting his stance. Sir Humphrey occasionally resorts to tactics such as calling a policy &quot;courageous&quot; to remind Hacker to contemplate the view that &quot;a controversial policy will lose votes, whilst a courageous one will lose the election&quot;, and thus to hinder the implementation of a particular policy. Sir Humphrey, on the other hand, believes that from the Civil Service&#x27;s perspective &quot;it makes very little difference who the Minister is&quot;.

The character of Bernard Woolley is characterised by a significant degree of ambivalence; largely playing the role of an observer of the cold conflict between Hacker and Sir Humphrey, mostly interjecting only to add a comic effect to the drama albeit occasionally playing a decisive part in determining which adversary triumphs ultimately. Initially, he naively sees his job as the disinterested implementation of the Minister&#x27;s policies, but he gradually finds that this conflicts with his institutional duty to the department, and sometimes (since Sir Humphrey is responsible for formally assessing Woolley&#x27;s performance) his own potential career development. Consequently, another recurring scenario is one where Bernard must &quot;walk the tightrope&quot; — that is, balance his two conflicting duties by resorting to elaborate verbosity (much like Sir Humphrey) so that he can avoid the appearance of being disloyal to one, in favour of the other. For example, in &quot;The Skeleton in the Cupboard&quot;, he sees the importance of notifying Sir Humphrey that Hacker has left his office, whilst still assisting Hacker in his aims. Such is Bernard&#x27;s success in performing this balancing act, that after the third series, following Sir Humphrey&#x27;s promotion to Cabinet Secretary, when Hacker becomes Prime Minister he requests that Bernard continue as his Principal Private Secretary, reasserting the perception that he is a &quot;high flier&quot;.

Sir Humphrey&#x27;s personal characteristics include his complicated sentences, his cynical views of government, and his snobbery and superciliousness. Hacker&#x27;s attributes include occasional indecisiveness, and a tendency to launch into ludicrous Churchillian speeches. Bernard is prone to linguistic pedantry. All characters are able to switch to a completely opposite opinion in seconds when convenient.

===Casting===
Nigel Hawthorne had worked with Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn before, and he and Paul Eddington claimed they immediately recognised the quality of writing of the series, but Jay and Lynn said that both actors asked for a second episode script (and a third script), after having read the pilot script, before committing to the series. When casting the role of Bernard, Jonathan Lynn met Derek Fowlds at a dinner, and subsequently offered him the role.

The first series featured Frank Weisel, Hacker&#x27;s political advisor (played by Neil Fitzwiliam in the television series, and later by Bill Nighy in the radio series). The first syllable of his surname is pronounced &quot;Wise&quot;, but Sir Humphrey and Bernard persistently call him &quot;Weasel&quot;. Weisel does not appear after the first series, following his acceptance of a position on a quango (Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation) tasked with investigating the appointment of other quangos, the government&#x27;s honours system, and &quot;jobs for the boys&quot;. The character was dropped because Jay and Lynn thought that the interjection of a character concerned with party political matters distracted from the focus on the tension between the government and the civil service.

The first series of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; introduced Dorothy Wainwright (played by Deborah Norton) as a highly able special political advisor to the Prime Minister. Her experience and insight into many civil service tricks ensure a lasting mutual distrust between her and Sir Humphrey and provide an invaluable second opinion for Hacker. Sir Humphrey frequently annoys Dorothy by addressing her as &quot;dear lady&quot; whereas she occasionally calls him &quot;Humpy&quot;.

Hacker&#x27;s home life is shown occasionally throughout the series. His wife Annie (Diana Hoddinott) is generally supportive, but is sometimes frustrated by the disruptions caused by her husband&#x27;s political career and is at times somewhat cynical about her husband&#x27;s politics. In one episode, his sociology student daughter, Lucy (Gerry Cowper), becomes an environmental activist, campaigning against the department&#x27;s intention to remove protected status from a wooded area believed to be inhabited by badgers. Sir Humphrey falsely assures her there have not been badgers in the woods for some years.

Sir Humphrey often discusses matters with other Permanent Secretaries, who appear similarly sardonic and jaded, and the Cabinet Secretary (whom he eventually succeeds in &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;), Sir Arnold Robinson (John Nettleton), an archetype of cynicism, haughtiness and conspiratorial expertise. Sir Frank Gordon, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, is a friend and often a rival as they jostle for supremacy within the civil service. The fairly counter-intuitive view of government administration displayed by Sir Humphrey is completely taken for granted by the Civil Service.

Almost all the episodes (the exceptions chiefly being the earlier ones of the first series) end with one of the characters (usually Sir Humphrey) saying &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; or once, &quot;Mais oui, Prime Minister,&quot; in &quot;A Diplomatic Incident&quot; which centred on negotiations with the President of France. Each episode of the former was more or less self-contained, but the first two episodes of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; had a loose story arc relating to Hacker&#x27;s attempts to reform the United Kingdom&#x27;s armed forces, while the second was mostly devoted to concluding storylines and character arcs that had been seen over the course of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

==Episodes==
A total of 38 episodes were made, and all but one are of 30 minutes duration. They were videotaped in front of a studio audience, which was standard BBC practice for situation comedies at the time. The actors did not enjoy filming as they felt that the studio audience placed them under additional pressure. Lynn, however, says that the studio audience on the soundtrack was necessary because laughter is a &quot;communal affair.&quot; The laughter also acted as a kind of insurance: Jay observes that politicians would be unable to put pressure on the BBC not to &quot;run this kind of nonsense&quot; if &quot;200–250 people were falling about with laughter.&quot; There were occasionally film inserts of location sequences, and some shots of Hacker travelling in his car were achieved by means of chroma key. Each programme usually comprised around six scenes. By the time of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, the producers were permitted to use Downing Street itself for some exterior shots, most notably in the episode &quot;The Key&quot; where Sir Humphrey has to re-enter the building through the door of No.10. Most episodes end with Sir Humphrey Appleby saying to Jim Hacker, &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; or &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, as appropriate. 

The pilot was produced in 1979 but not transmitted immediately for fear that it could influence the results of the May 1979 UK General Election. It eventually aired on 25 February 1980. &quot;Yes Minister&quot; ran for three series, each of seven episodes, between March 1980 and 1982. These were followed by two Christmas specials: one 10-minute sketch as part of an anthology presented by Frank Muir, and then the hour-long &quot;Party Games&quot;, in 1984. The latter&#x27;s events led to Hacker&#x27;s elevation to Prime Minister, dovetailing into the sequel, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. This ran originally for two series, each of eight episodes, from 1986 to 1988.

In the U.K. the show has regularly reaired on TV including on BBC and That&#x27;s TV channels.

===Reboot===
In January 2013, a new series of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; was launched on the Gold television channel. Jim Hacker is now portrayed as heading a coalition government, while dealing with an economic downturn, his coalition partner having a leadership crisis, and Scottish independence. The revived series was produced by the BBC for Gold.

==Reception==
The series gained high audience figures, and 90+ on the audience Appreciation Index. Critics, such as Andrew Davies in the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot; and Armando Iannucci, have noted that the show had high expectations of its audience. Lynn posits that the public are more intelligent than most situation comedies, often patronisingly, give them credit for. Jay believes that the viewers were just as intelligent as the writers, but that there were some things that they needed to know but didn&#x27;t.

&quot;Yes Minister&quot; won the BAFTA award for Best Comedy Series for 1980, 1981 and 1982, and the &quot;Party Games&quot; special was nominated in the Best Light Entertainment Programme category for 1984. &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; was short-listed for Best Comedy Series for both 1986 and 1987. Nigel Hawthorne&#x27;s portrayal of Sir Humphrey Appleby won the BAFTA Award for Best Light Entertainment Performance four times (in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987). Eddington was also nominated on all four occasions. Nigel Hawthorne was awarded Best Actor in Light Entertainment Programme at the 1981 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards.

&quot;Yes Minister&quot; came sixth in a 2004 BBC poll to find &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&#x27;. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; were both placed ninth. They were also placed 14th in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Sitcom&quot;, a poll conducted by people who work in sitcoms.

Some political scientists cite the series for its accurate and sophisticated portrayal of the relationships between civil servants and politicians, and are quoted in some textbooks on British politics. Some political scientists considered it a reflection of the public choice model, which encouraged a &quot;conservative agenda of balanced budgets and reduced government spending&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered its &quot;ideas were at the center of the Thatcher and Ronald Reagan administrations in Britain and the United States, which favored cutting government and shifting its functions to the private sector&quot;.

The series was praised by critics and politicians, and allegedly the shows were popular in government circles. &quot;The Guinness Television Encyclopedia&quot; suggests that &quot;real politicians ... enjoyed the show&#x27;s cynical dismissal of Whitehall intrigue and its insights into the machinations of government.&quot; Lord Donoughue, an admirer of the series who was head of James Callaghan&#x27;s policy unit at 10 Downing Street from 1976 to 1979, noticed that, when the Labour Party returned to power in 1997 after 18 years in opposition, a number of junior Ministers took so seriously the relationships with civil servants as depicted by Jay and Lynn that they were unduly wary of senior officials and allowed this suspicion to influence their behaviour.

&quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; were the favourite programme of then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. She told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;its clearly-observed portrayal of what goes on in the corridors of power has given me hours of pure joy.&quot; Gerald Kaufman described it as &quot;The Rt Hon. Faust MP, constantly beset by the wiles of Sir Mephistopheles.&quot; As a supporter of Thatcher, Jay embraced her appreciation, although the more leftist Lynn was concerned.

Thatcher performed a short sketch with Eddington and Hawthorne on 20 January 1984 at a ceremony where the writers were presented with an award from Mary Whitehouse&#x27;s NVLA, an event commemorated on the cover of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. Authorship of the sketch is unclear. In &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;, Bernard Ingham says that he wrote it; other sources give Thatcher sole credit, while Michael Cockerell says that she wrote it with Ingham&#x27;s help. Another source gives renegade credit to Charles Powell. The actors, who were starring in separate West End plays at the time, were not enthusiastic at the idea and asked Lynn to &quot;get them out&quot; of it. The writer, however, was not in a position to help. Hawthorne says he and Eddington resented Thatcher&#x27;s attempts to &quot;make capital&quot; from their popularity. Ingham says that it &quot;went down a bomb&quot;, while Lynn brands it a &quot;dreadful sketch&quot; that was only funny because Thatcher was doing it. Accepting the award from the NVLA, Lynn thanked Thatcher &quot;for taking her rightful place in the field of situation comedy.&quot; Everyone, except the Prime Minister, laughed.

When Paul Eddington visited Australia during the 1980s, he was treated as a visiting British PM by the then Australian leader, Bob Hawke, who was a fan of the show. At a rally, Hawke said &quot;You don&#x27;t want to be listening to me; you want to be listening to the real Prime Minister&quot;, forcing Eddington to improvise. In an interview to promote the first series of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, Derek Fowlds said that &quot;both political sides believe that it satirises their opponents, and civil servants love it because it depicts them as being more powerful than either. And of course, they love it because it&#x27;s all so authentic.&quot; The series was well received in the United States, running on the A&amp;E Network and repeatedly on public television.

===International remakes===
The show has been remade several times internationally, albeit sometimes unofficially.

The series was remade in Portugal in 1996 as &quot;Sim, Sr. Ministro&quot; by Portuguese channel TVI. The names of characters, locations and institutions were changed to reflect Portuguese reality, but the plot of the episodes follow the originals. A total of 26 episodes were produced and screened between 1996 and 1997.

&quot;Not My Department&quot; took joint inspiration from &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and Charles Gordon&#x27;s The Governor General&#x27;s Bunny Hop, a contemporary satire of Canadian politics. Unlike &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, &quot;Not My Department&quot; was set almost entirely among public servants, with the Minister for Regional Incentive Targets only making occasional appearances by video tape—often because he was hoping to evade the latest scandal by taking protracted tours of the regions. &quot;Not My Department&quot; aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1987.

&quot;Ji Mantriji&quot; (literally &quot;Yes Minister&quot; in Hindi) is an Indian adaptation of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. It was telecast on STAR TV&#x27;s channel STAR Plus with permission from the BBC. &quot;Ji Mantriji&quot; features Farooq Sheikh as Surya Prakash Singh, the Minister of Administrative Affairs and Jayant Kripalani as the department&#x27;s secretary. The plot lines were the same as those of the original, with suitable changes in the Indian context.

&quot;Sayın Bakanım&quot; (&quot;Dear Minister&quot; in Turkish) is a Turkish adaptation of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; that ran in 2004. The show featured acclaimed actors Haluk Bilginer, Kenan Isik and Ali Sunal. &quot;Sayin Bakanim&quot; was cancelled after 14 episodes. Although there were rumours that the show was scrapped because of a warning from the government, the producer of the show denied this. Instead, he explained that the reason was low ratings.

The Australian series &quot;The Hollowmen&quot; and &quot;Utopia&quot; were also inspired by &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

The Ukrainian series &quot;Servant of the People&quot; also known as &quot;Sluha Narodu&quot; takes some inspiration from the show in its plots and themes.

The Israeli sitcom &quot;Polishook&quot;, also modelled on &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, aired for two series on Channel 2&#x27;s Keshet Broadcasting.

A Dutch remake had been made by S&amp;V Fiction for VPRO, lasting 11 episodes, called &quot;Ja, Bewindsman&quot; (&quot;Sorry Minister&quot;). In the Dutch version, Sir Humphrey is a woman and Bernard is a Moroccan called Mohammed.

==In other media==
===Theatre===

Jay and Lynn collaborated again to produce a stage play, titled &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. It ran from 13 May to 5 June 2010, at Chichester Festival Theatre. This production revived at the Gielgud Theatre, in London&#x27;s West End from 17 September 2010 until 15 January 2011. The principal cast was David Haig as Jim Hacker, Henry Goodman as Sir Humphrey, Jonathan Slinger as Bernard Woolley and Emily Joyce as Claire Sutton, Hacker&#x27;s special policy advisor.

Lynn wrote another play &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, Prime Minister, I Can&#x27;t Quite Remember&quot; focusing on an ageing retired Hacker and Sir Humphrey. It was first performed in 2023. Christopher Bianchi played Hacker, whilst Clive Francis portrayed Humphrey.

===Radio===
Sixteen episodes of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; were adapted and re-recorded for broadcast by BBC Radio 4, with the principal cast reprising their roles. Produced by Pete Atkin, they were broadcast across two series, each with eight episodes. The first series aired 18 October to 6 December 1983, with the second originally transmitted 9 October to 27 November 1984. The complete set was released on cassette in February 2000, and on compact disc in October 2002. The series was repeated on the digital radio station BBC Radio 7 in early 2007 and on BBC Radio 4 Extra in November 2013. The series was re-repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2018.

In 1997, Derek Fowlds reprised the role of Bernard Woolley to read Antony Jay&#x27;s &quot;How To Beat Sir Humphrey: Every Citizen&#x27;s Guide To Fighting Officialdom&quot;. It was broadcast in three daily parts by Radio 4 from 29 September to 1 October 1997 and released by BBC Audiobooks on cassette in October 1997.

===Ceremony===
The British Prime Minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher, was so taken by the show that she wrote a sketch herself (together with her Press Secretary Bernard Ingham). In it she played herself as the Prime Minister, Paul Eddington played Jim Hacker and Nigel Hawthorne played Sir Humphrey. It was played on the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association Awards 1984.

== In other countries ==
Both series were aired in Scandinavia during the 1980s.

Both series were also aired in the Czech Republic (ČT2) on Friday nights along with other &#x27;britcoms&#x27;.

Israel Broadcasting Authority aired both series during the early to mid-1980s where they both gained broad popularity.

After 7 episodes of the first series &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; were broadcast on China Central Television in mainland China under the name of &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; (是，大臣), Chen Xuyi, the former director of the translation and production factory of Shanghai Film Translation Factory, died, and there was no successor to the translator, so it had to stop. It was not introduced from the video website until 2021. In 2024, it was broadcast on Youku and Bilibili, and the BBC Entertainment was introduced in Taiwan to translate it as &quot;Minister&quot; (部长大人). Hong Kong TVB Pearl has also broadcast this drama. At that time, the Chinese name was &quot;Prime Minister, what do you want?&quot; (首相你想点). 

There have been at least three translation versions of the simplified Chinese version of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; published. One of them of the BBC book version of &quot;The Complete Yes Minister&quot; () was published in Beijing in 1991. The Chinese translator was Cheng Hong, whose husband Li Keqiang later became the Prime Minister of People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Both series aired in the United States on some PBS stations during the 1980s, usually in the Sunday night British Comedy Block, and have aired on PBS stations as recently as 2021.

In West Germany, all three series of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; were aired in 1987 (German title: &quot;Yes Minister&quot;), and the first series of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; in 1988 (German title: &quot;Yes Premierminister&quot;) on national public broadcaster ARD; repeats occurred during the 1990s on some of the public regional channels. They were broadcast in bilingual mode, permitting owners of a stereo set to select between German overdub and English original sound. Each episode was shortened by about 5 minutes to allow time for the continuity announcer, as was common practice at the time. The second series of &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot; was never aired in Germany, thus no German overdub and no German episode titles exist for it. The German DVD release (December 2013) reflects these alterations; it contains the full length episodes, but during the edited portions it throws the German sound back to the English one, and it omits the second series of &quot;Yes Prime Minister&quot;. The books &quot;The Complete Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;The Complete Yes, Prime Minister&quot; were also translated into German as &quot;Yes Minister&quot; () and &quot;Yes Premierminister&quot; () respectively.

In Spain, the series was broadcast under the title of &quot;Sí ministro&quot;.

==Merchandise==

The BBC issued some episodes of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, and all of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; on VHS. They were re-released and repackaged at various points. The complete collection was released by the BBC through Warner Home Video on Region 1 DVD in October 2003. Warner appears to have added RCE region coding to the individual release of the second series of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, but there are no similar reported problems on playing the complete collection. The BBC, through 2 Entertain Video, also issued several Region 2 DVDs:

===Books===
The series spawned several books. The scripts were edited and transformed into prose, and published by BBC Books in the form of diaries. Scenes that did not involve Hacker took the form of private memos between civil servants, or &#x27;interviews&#x27; and written correspondence from other characters. In some instances, the novelizations added extra details, while padding-out some existing details. For example, in the novelization for &#x27;The Official Visit&#x27;, Sir Humphrey manages to confuse Hacker, by reeling-off a plethora of acronyms—without explaining them, leaving Hacker with nonsense to fathom.

The three series of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; were published as paperbacks in 1981, 1982 and 1983 respectively before being combined into a revised hardback omnibus edition, &quot;The Complete Yes Minister: The Diaries of a Cabinet Minister&quot;, in 1984. Two volumes of &quot;Yes, Prime Minister: The Diaries of the Right Hon. James Hacker&quot; were published in 1986 and 1987, before being made available as an omnibus edition in 1988. Both series were published as omnibus paperback editions in 1989:
* &quot;The Complete Yes Minister&quot; 
* &quot;The Complete Yes, Prime Minister&quot; 

Sir Antony Jay&#x27;s &quot;How to Beat Sir Humphrey: Every Citizen&#x27;s Guide to Fighting Officialdom&quot; () was published in April 1997. It was illustrated by Gerald Scarfe and Shaun Williams. It was read by Derek Fowlds on Radio 4 later that year.

&quot;The &quot;Yes Minister&quot; Miscellany&quot; was released in October 2009.

The script of the play, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, was published in paperback by Faber &amp; Faber in 2010 ().

Graham McCann&#x27;s &#x27;A Very Courageous Decision: The Inside Story of Yes Minister,&#x27; was published by Aurum Books in October 2014 ().

===Video game===
A &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; video game was released in 1987 for Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and ZX Spectrum. The player takes on the role of Prime Minister Jim Hacker for one week as he navigates through meetings with Sir Humphrey, Bernard Woolley, and other government officials, making decisions about seemingly minor government policies which regardless have an effect on the PM&#x27;s approval rating by the end of the week.

==In popular culture==
In 2005, BBC Four launched &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, described by director Armando Iannucci as &quot;&quot;Yes Minister&quot; meets &quot;Larry Sanders&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;a &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; for the Labour years.&quot; The style shows many identifiable hallmarks of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, namely the blundering politician virtually entirely dependent on those whose presentational and political nous greatly eclipse his own limited abilities.

As an adaptation of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, Armando Iannucci also created and directed &quot;Veep&quot;, an American political satire comedy television series. As the United States has a different political system from United Kingdom&#x27;s parliamentary system, the show instead focuses on a fictional female Vice President of the United States and her staff. Both &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; and &quot;Veep&quot; feature a Prime Minister/President that is never depicted on-screen, but nevertheless highly influential in the plot; and in both series, the unseen Prime Minister/President eventually resigns, with the result that both protagonists later become the Prime Minister/President themselves.

In a 2006 poll, British MPs voted &quot;Yes Minister&quot; as the greatest political comedy of all time.

In January 2025, the British government announced that a new collection of artificial intelligence tools aimed at helping civil servants with their work would be called Humphrey, named after the &quot;Yes Minister&quot; character Sir Humphrey Appleby.

<doc id="89293" wikidata="Q2000229" url="?curid=89293" title="Robert L. Forward">
<text>Robert Lull Forward (August 15, 1932 – September 21, 2002) was an American physicist and science fiction writer. His literary work was noted for its scientific credibility and use of ideas developed from his career as an aerospace engineer. He also made important contributions to gravitational wave detection research.

==Biography==
Forward earned his doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1965, with a thesis entitled &quot;Detectors for Dynamic Gravitational Fields&quot;, for the development of a bar antenna for the detection of gravitational radiation.

===Career and research===
He then went to work at the research labs of Hughes Aircraft, where he continued his research on gravity measurement and received 18 patents. He took early retirement in 1987, to focus on his fiction writing and consulting for such clients as NASA and the U.S. Air Force. In 1994, he co-founded the company Tethers Unlimited, Inc. with Robert P. Hoyt, where he served as chief scientist and chairman until 2002.

Much of his research focused on the leading edges of speculative physics but was always grounded in what he believed humans could accomplish. He worked on such projects as space tethers and space fountains, solar sails (including Starwisp), antimatter propulsion, and other spacecraft propulsion technologies, and did further research on more esoteric possibilities such as time travel and negative matter. He was issued a patent for the statite, and contributed to a concept to drain the Van Allen Belts.

====Forward Mass Detector====
Forward&#x27;s extensive work in the field of gravitational wave detection included the invention of the rotating cruciform gravity gradiometer or &#x27;Forward Mass Detector&#x27;, for Lunar Mascon (mass concentration) measurements. The gravity gradiometer is described in the well-known textbook &quot;Gravitation&quot; by Misner, Thorne &amp; Wheeler. The principle behind it is quite simple; getting the implementation right is tricky. Essentially, two beams are crossed over and connected with an axle through their crossing point. They are held at right angles to each other by springs. They have heavy masses at the ends of the beams, and the whole assembly spun around the common axle at high speed. The angle between the beams is measured continuously, and if it varies with a period half that of the rotation period, it means that the detector is experiencing a measurable gravitational field gradient.

====Vacuum Fluctuation Battery====
In 1984, Forward published his theoretical design for a &quot;Casimir battery&quot;, utilizing the electromagnetic Zero-point energy and the attractive force associated. The Casimir force would pull the plates together, if the plates were charged with same polarity and the electrostatic force applied to the plates is adjusted. The Casimir force will pull the plates together increasing the electric field between each plate and producing a voltage. The battery could be &quot;recharged&quot; by increasing the electrostatic force, pushing the plates apart.

===Fiction===
In addition to more than 200 papers and articles, he published 11 novels. Critics&#x27; reviews were mixed, always praising the science concepts and the aliens he created, but often finding the plots thin and the humans shallow.
His treatment of hard-science topics in fictional form is highly reminiscent of the work of Hal Clement. He described his first novel, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Egg&quot;, as &quot;a textbook on neutron star physics disguised as a novel.&quot; His novel &quot;Rocheworld&quot; describes a double-planet system with a single shared atmosphere and ocean, and a beam-powered propulsion interstellar space ship to get there. Forward co-authored two Rocheworld novels with his wife, Martha Dodson Forward, and two additional Rocheworld novels with his second daughter, Julie Fuller. Forward also helped Larry Niven calculate the parameters of the Smoke Ring for his novel &quot;The Integral Trees&quot;. Much of his scientific research in speculative physics serves as inspiration for science fiction, many of his ideas on Zero-point energy, Interstellar travel and propulsion can be found in contemporary and modern scientific fiction.

===Personal life===
Forward&#x27;s son, Bob Forward, has led a successful career as a storyboard artist and writer in television animation, including in &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and most famously, &quot;Beast Wars&quot;. He is also the author of two novels, &quot;The Owl&quot; and &quot;The Owl 2: Scarlet Serenade.&quot;

Forward&#x27;s youngest, Eve Forward, has written two novels: &quot;Villains by Necessity&quot; and &quot;Animist&quot;.

===Death===
In 2001, Forward received a diagnosis of terminal cancer. He died on September 21, 2002.

<text>The year 689 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 65 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 689 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>Lace is a delicate fabric made of yarn or thread in an open weblike pattern, made by machine or by hand. Generally, lace is split into two main categories, needlelace and bobbin lace, although there are other types of lace, such as knitted or crocheted lace. Other laces such as these are considered as a category of their specific craft. Knitted lace, therefore, is an example of knitting. This article considers both needle lace and bobbin lace.

While some experts say both needle lace and bobbin lace began in Italy in the late 1500s, there are some questions regarding its origins.

Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.

==Etymology==
The word lace is from Middle English, from Old French &quot;las&quot;, noose, string, from Vulgar Latin *&quot;laceum&quot;, from Latin &quot;laqueus&quot;, noose; probably akin to &quot;lacere&quot;, to entice or ensnare.

== Description ==
The Latin word from which &quot;lace&quot; is derived means &quot;noose,&quot; and a noose describes an open space outlined with rope or thread. This description applies to many types of open fabric resulting from &quot;looping, plaiting, twisting, or knotting...threads...by hand or machine.&quot;

==Types==
There are many types of lace, classified by how they are made. These include:

* Bobbin lace, as the name suggests, is made with bobbins and a pillow. The bobbins, turned from wood, bone, or plastic, hold threads which are woven together and held in place with pins stuck in the pattern on the pillow. The pillow contains straw, preferably oat straw or other materials such as sawdust, insulation styrofoam, or ethafoam. Also known as bone-lace. Chantilly lace is a type of bobbin lace.
* Chemical lace: the stitching area is stitched with embroidery threads that form a continuous motif. Afterwards, the stitching areas are removed and only the embroidery remains. The stitching ground is made of a water-soluble or non-heat-resistant material.
*Crocheted lace includes Irish crochet, pineapple crochet, and filet crochet.
* Cutwork, or whitework, is lace constructed by removing threads from a woven background, and the remaining threads wrapped or filled with embroidery.
* Knitted lace includes Shetland lace, such as the &quot;wedding ring shawl&quot;, a lace shawl so fine that it can be pulled through a wedding ring.
*Knotted lace includes macramé and tatting. 
* Machine-made lace is any style of lace created or replicated using mechanical means.
* Needle lace, such as Venetian Gros Point, is made using a needle and thread. This is the most flexible of the lace-making arts. While some types can be made more quickly than the finest of bobbin laces, others are very time-consuming. Some purists regard needle lace as the height of lace-making. The finest antique needle laces were made from a very fine thread that is not manufactured today.
*Tape lace makes the tape in the lace as it is worked, or uses a machine- or hand-made textile strip formed into a design, then joined and embellished with needle or bobbin lace.
*Tatting is a textile craft consisting of a series of knots and loops arranged with a shuttle or needle based process.

==History: Bobbin and needle lace==

=== Origins ===
The origin of lace is disputed by historians. An Italian claim is a will of 1493 by the Milanese Sforza family. A Flemish claim is lace on the alb of a worshiping priest in a painting about 1485 by Hans Memling.
But since lace evolved from other techniques, it is impossible to say that it originated in any one place. The fragility of lace also means that few exceedingly old specimens are extant.

=== Early history ===
Lace was used by clergy of the Catholic Church as part of vestments in religious ceremonies. When they first started to use lace and through the 16th century, they primarily used cutwork. Much of their lace was made of gold, silver, and silk. Wealthy people began to use such expensive lace in clothing trimmings and furnishings, such as cushion covers. In the 1300s and 1400s in the Italian states, heavy duties were imposed on lace, and strict sumptuary laws were passed. This led to less demand for lace. In the mid-1400s some lacemakers turned to using flax, which cost less, while others migrated, bringing the industry to other countries. However, lace did not come into widespread use until the 16th century in the northwestern part of the European continent. The popularity of lace increased rapidly and the cottage industry of lace making spread throughout Europe. The late 16th century marked the rapid development of lace, both needle lace and bobbin lace became dominant in both fashion as well as home décor. For enhancing the beauty of collars and cuffs, needle lace was embroidered with loops and picots. Sumptuary laws in many countries had a major impact on lace wearing and production throughout its early history, though in some countries they were often ignored or worked around.

=== Italy ===
Bobbin and needle lace were both being made in Italy early in the 1400s. Documenting lace in Italy in the 15th century is a list of fine laces from the inventory of Beatrice d&#x27;Este, Duchess of Milan, from 1493.

==== Venice ====
In Venice, lace making was originally the province of leisured noblewomen, using it as a pastime. Some of the wives of doges also supported lacemaking in the Republic. One, Giovanna Malipiero Dandolo, showed support in 1457 for a law protecting lacemakers. In 1476, the lace trade was seriously affected by a law which disallowed &quot;silver and embroidery on any fabric and the Punto in Aria of linen threads made with a needle, or gold and silver threads.&quot; In 1595, Morosina Morosini, another doge&#x27;s wife, founded a lace workshop for 130 women. In the early 1500s, the production of lace became a paid activity, accomplished by young girls working in the houses of noblewomen, creating lace for household use, and in convents. Lace was a popular Venetian export in the 1500s and 1600s, and the demand remained strong in Europe, even when the export of other items exported by Venice during this period slumped. The largest and most intricate pieces of Venetian lace became ruffs and collars for members of the nobility and for aristocrats.

=== Belgium ===
Lace was being made in Brussels in the 1400s, and samples of such lace survive. Belgium and Flanders became a major center for the creation of primarily bobbin lace starting in the 1500s, and some handmade lace is still being produced there today. Belgian-grown flax contributed to the lace industry in the country. It produced extremely fine linen threads that were a critical factor in the superior texture and quality of Belgian lace. Schools were founded to teach lacemaking to the young. The height of the production of lace there was in the 1700s. Brussels was known for Point d&#x27;Angleterre, Lierre and Bruges also were known for their own styles of lace. Belgian lacemakers either originated or developed laces such as Brussels or Brabant Lace, Lace of Flanders, Mechlin, Valenciennes and Binche.

=== France ===
Lace arrived in France when Catherine de Medici, newly married to King Henry II in 1533, brought Venetian lace-makers to her new homeland. The French royal court and the fashions popular there, influenced the lace that started to be made in France. It was delicate and graceful, compared to the heavier needle or point-laces of Venice. Examples of French lace are Alençon, Argentan, and Chantilly. The 17th century court of King Louis the XIV of France was known for its extravagance, and during his reign lace, particularly the delicate Alençon and Argentan varieties, was extremely popular as court dress. The frontange, a tall lace headdress, became fashionable in France at this time. Louis XIV&#x27;s finance minister, Jean Baptiste Colbert, strengthened the lace industry by establishing lace schools and workshops in the country.

=== Spain ===
Lacemaking in Spain was established early, as by the 1600s its Point d&#x27;Espagne lace, made of gold and silver thread, was very popular. Lace was made for use in churches and for the mantilla. Lacemaking may have come to Spain from Italy in the 1500s, or from Flanders, its province at the time. This lace was much admired, and was made throughout the country.

=== Germany ===
Barbara Uttmann learned how to make bobbin lace as a girl from a Protestant refugee. In 1561 she started a lace-making workshop in Annaberg. By the time of her death in 1575, there were over 30,000 lacemakers in that area of Germany. Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France in 1685, many Huguenot lacemakers moved to Hamburg and Berlin. The earliest known lace pattern book was printed in Cologne in 1527.

=== England ===
The lace that was made in England prior to the introduction of bobbin lace in the mid 1500s was primarily cutwork or drawn thread work. There is a 1554 mention of Sir Thomas Wyatt wearing a ruff trimmed with bone lace (some bobbins at the time were made of bone). The court of Queen Elizabeth of England maintained close ties with the French court, and so French lace began to be seen and appreciated in England. Lace was used on her court gowns, and became fashionable.

There are two distinct areas of England where lacemaking was a significant industry: Devon and part of the South Midlands. Belgian lacemakers were encouraged to settle in Honiton in Devon at the end of the 16th century. They continued to make pillow and other lace, as they had in their homeland, but Honiton lace never got the acclaim that lace from France, Italy, and Belgium did. While the lace in Devon stayed stable, in the lace-making areas of the South Midlands there were changes brought by different groups of émigrés: Flemings, French Huguenots, and later, French escaping the Revolution.

Catherine of Aragon, while exiled in Ampthill, England, was said to have supported the lace makers there by burning all her lace, and commissioning new pieces. This may be the origin of the lacemaker&#x27;s holiday, Cattern&#x27;s Day. On this day (25 or 26 November) lacemakers were given a day off from work, and Cattern cakes - small dough cakes made with caraway seeds, were used to celebrate. The English diarist Samuel Pepys often wrote about the lace used for his, his wife&#x27;s, and his acquaintances&#x27; clothing, and on 10 May 1669, noted that he intended to remove the gold lace from the sleeves of his coat &quot;as it is fit [he] should&quot;, possibly in order to avoid charges of ostentatious living. In 1840, Britain&#x27;s Queen Victoria was married in lace, influencing the wedding dress style until now.

The decline of the lace industry in England began about 1780, as was happening elsewhere. Some of the reasons include the increased popularity of clothing in the Classical style, the economic issues connected to war, and the increased production and use of machine-made laces.

=== America ===
American colonists of both British and Dutch origins strove to acquire lace accessories such as caps, ruffs, and other neckwear, and handkerchiefs. American women who afford lace textiles were also able to afford aprons and dresses trimmed with the technique or made only from lace. Because of sumptuary laws, such as one in Massachusetts in 1634, American citizens were not allowed to own or make their lace textiles. Sumptuary laws prevented spending on extravagance and luxury and classified who could own or make lace. This indicates that lace was being made in that colony at the time. Lacemaking was being taught in boarding schools by the mid 1700s, and newspaper advertisements starting in the early 1700s offered to teach the technique. Also in the 18th century, Ipswich, Massachusetts had become the only place in America known for producing handmade lace. By 1790, women in Ipswich, who were primarily from the British Midlands, were making 42,000 yards of silk bobbin lace intended for trimmings. George Washington reportedly purchased Ipswich Lace on a trip to the region in 1789. Machines to make lace began to be smuggled into the country in the early 1800s, as England did not permit these machines to be exported. The first lacemaking factory opened in Medway, Massachusetts in 1818. Ipswich had its own in 1824. The women there moved from making bobbin lace to decorating the machine-made net lace with darning and tambour stitches, creating what is known as Limerick lace.

Lace was still much in demand in the 19th century. Lace trimmings on dresses, at seams, pockets, and collars were very popular. The lace being made in the United States was based on European patterns. By the turn of the 20th century, needlework and other magazines included lace patterns of a range of types.

In North America in the 19th century, missionaries spread the knowledge of lace making to the Native American tribes. Sibyl Carter, an Episcopalian missionary, began to teach lacemaking to Ojibwa women in Minnesota in 1890. Classes were being held for members of many tribes throughout the US by the first decade of the 1900s St. John Francis Regis guided many women out of prostitution by establishing them in the lace making and embroidery trade, which is why he became the Patron Saint of lace making.

=== Ireland ===

Lace was made in Ireland from the 1730s onwards with several different lace-making schools founded across the country. Many regions acquired a name for high-quality work and others developed a distinctive style. Lace proved to be an important means of income for many poorer women. Several important schools of lace included: Carrickmacross lace, Kenmare lace, Limerick lace and Youghal lace.

== Lace in art ==

The earliest portraits showing lace are those of the early Florentine School. Later, in the 17th century, lace was very popular and painting styles were at the time realistic. This allows viewers to see the finery of lace. Painted portraits, primarily those of the wealthy or the nobility, depicted costly laces. This presented a challenge to the painters, who needed to represent not only their sitters accurately, but their intricate lace as well.

The portrait of Nicolaes Hasselaer seen here was painted by Frans Hals in about 1627. It depicts a man dressed in a black garment with a lace collar. The collar is detailed enough that those who are expert in lace identification can tell what pattern it is. Hals created the lace effect with dabs of grey and white, using black paint to indicate the spaces between the threads.

An image of an anonymous female artisan appears in &quot;The Lacemaker&quot;, a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675), completed around 1669–1670.

<text>The Likely Lads is a British sitcom created and written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and produced by Dick Clement. Twenty episodes were broadcast by the BBC, in three series, between 16 December 1964 and 23 July 1966. However, only ten of these episodes have survived.

This show was followed by a sequel series, in colour, entitled &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, broadcast between 9 January 1973 and 24 December 1974. This was followed in 1976 by a spin-off feature film &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;.

Some episodes of both the original black and white series and the colour sequel were adapted for BBC radio with the original television cast.

==Premise==
The original show followed the friendship of two young working class men, Terry Collier (James Bolam) and Bob Ferris (Rodney Bewes), in the mid-1960s. Bob and Terry are assumed to be in their early 20s (when their ages are revealed in the later film, this puts both characters at around 20 when the series started).

After growing up at school and in the Scouts together, Bob and Terry are working in the same factory, Ellison&#x27;s Electrical, alongside the older, wiser duo of Cloughie and Jack. The show&#x27;s humour derived largely from the tensions between Terry&#x27;s cynical, everyman, working class personality and Bob&#x27;s ambition to better himself and move to the middle class.

Bob and Terry are two average working class lads growing up (despite Bob’s very West-Riding accent) in the industrial North East, whose hobbies are beer, football and girls. They are street-wise, yet they stumble into one scrape after another as they struggle to enjoy the Swinging Sixties on their meagre incomes.

At the end of the third and final series in 1966, a depressed and bored Bob attempts to join the Army but is rejected because of his flat feet. Terry, who decides at the last minute to enlist to keep Bob company, is accepted and shipped away for three years.

It was gradually revealed that Terry and Bob&#x27;s full names are Terence Daniel Collier and Robert Andrew Scarborough Ferris (&quot;Scarborough&quot; not revealed until the 1970s colour series). According to the later feature film, made in 1976, both &quot;Lads&quot; were conceived during the same wartime air raid and were thus born in the same year, 1944.

Although in the colour sequel much is made of Thelma, who is said to have been Bob&#x27;s childhood sweetheart, she had appeared only once in the original show, in which Bob has no steady girlfriend and is forever seeking one, though Thelma is mentioned in some episodes in series three, including &quot;Rocker&quot; and &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot;.

== Etymology==

The word &quot;likely&quot; in the show&#x27;s title is ambiguous. In some dialects in Northern England it means &quot;likeable&quot; but it may be derived from the phrase &quot;the man most likely to&quot; (i.e. likely to succeed, having potential), a boxing expression in common use on Tyneside, hence, in Geordie slang, &quot;a likely lad&quot;. Another possible meaning is the ambiguous Northern usage of &quot;likely&quot; to mean a small-time troublemaker.

==Cast==
*James Bolam as Terry Collier
*Rodney Bewes as Bob Ferris
*Brigit Forsyth as Thelma Chambers
*Sheila Fearn as Audrey Collier, Terry&#x27;s older sister
*Bartlett Mullins as Cloughie, a workmate
*Don McKillop as Jack, another workmate
*Olive Milbourne as Mrs Edith Collier, Terry and Audrey&#x27;s mother
*Alex McDonald as Mr Cyril Collier, Terry and Audrey&#x27;s dad
*Irene Richmond as Mrs Alice Ferris, Bob&#x27;s mother
*Richard Moore as Blakey

Guest stars included George Layton, Garfield Morgan, Wendy Richard, Wanda Ventham, Susan Jameson (the real-life wife of James Bolam), Michael Sheard, Nerys Hughes, Geoffrey Hughes, Helen Fraser and Tony Caunter.

==Episodes==
Only eleven episodes survive (as film telerecordings) in the BBC&#x27;s archives, as a result of its wiping policy of the time. However, the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public campaign, continues to search for missing episodes. Of the ten remaining lost episodes, only &#x27;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&#x27; was not recorded as part of the radio adaptation series.

===Series 1 (1964–65)===
===Series 2 (1965)===
===Series 3 (1966)===
==&quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot;==
Additionally, an eight-minute episode of &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; was broadcast on 25 December 1964, as part of a 90-minute Christmas Day special on BBC 1 called &quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot; 7:15 p.m. to 8:45 p.m., in which Bob and Terry have an argument over Bob&#x27;s encyclopaedic knowledge of &quot;Rupert Bear&quot; Annuals (&quot;It was Edward Trunk!&quot;). This recording still exists in the BBC Broadcast Archive. An edited version, which included &#x27;The Likely Lads&#x27; sketch, was screened on BBC2 over Christmas 1991.

==Radio adaptations==
Sixteen of the television scripts were adapted for radio by James Bolam, and broadcast in two series during 1967 and 1968.

Produced by John Browell, the radio adaptations were recorded at the Paris Studios in Lower Regent Street, London using the original television cast (although some minor parts had to be recast for some episodes, where the original actor was unavailable).
As of January 2025, BBC Radio 4 Extra started broadcasting the first series only for the first time on that station.

===Series 1===
===Series 2===
==DVD and Blu-ray releases==
Only seven of the eight (then) extant episodes were included on the original UK DVD release issued in February 2006, in spite of the cover stating that it contained all the surviving episodes. The absent eighth episode, &quot;The Other Side of the Fence&quot;, was subsequently included on the &quot;Likely Lads&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; combined box set in October 2006, presented as an &#x27;extra&#x27; rather than in chronological order.

&quot;A Star Is Born&quot; and &quot;Far Away Places&quot;, two previously missing episodes from the second series recovered in 2018, were included as extras on the 2019 Network DVD and Blu-ray release of the 1976 feature film.

In 2024, BBC Studios released &quot;The Likely Lads Complete Collection&quot; DVD for the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary, presenting all ten surviving episodes of the original 60s series alongside either off-air or radio versions of the remaining ten lost episodes for the very first time.

<doc id="89306" wikidata="Q7991728" url="?curid=89306" title="Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?">
<text>Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? is a British sitcom which was broadcast on BBC1 between 9 January 1973 and 9 April 1974. It was the colour sequel to the mid-1960s hit &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;. It was created and written, as was its predecessor, by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. There were 26 television episodes over two series, and a subsequent 45-minute Christmas special was aired on 24 December 1974. The show won the BAFTA Television Award for Best Situation Comedy in 1974.

The cast was reunited in 1975 for a BBC radio adaptation of series 1, transmitted on Radio 4 from July to October that year. A feature film spin-off was made in 1976. Around the time of its release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press, and never spoke again. This long-suspected feud was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Even while Bewes was alive, Bolam was consistently reluctant to talk about the show, and vetoed any attempt to revive his character. Following Bewes&#x27;s death in November 2017, Bolam maintained there was never any rift.

==Plot==
Set in Newcastle upon Tyne in north-east England, the show follows the friendship, resumed after seven years apart, of two working-class young men, Bob Ferris (Rodney Bewes) and Terry Collier (James Bolam). The word &quot;likely&quot; in the title referred, in the 1960s series, to those showing promise, but also to those likely to get up to well-meaning mischief. The humour was based on the tension between Terry&#x27;s firmly working-class outlook and Bob&#x27;s aspirations to join the middle class, through his new white-collar job, suburban home and impending marriage to the prissy librarian Thelma Chambers (Brigit Forsyth).

Since the ending of the original series in 1966, Bob has left factory life behind and now works for his future father-in-law&#x27;s construction firm, something which makes him even more desperate to curry favour with Thelma and her family. At Thelma&#x27;s urging, Bob is also joining sports clubs and attending dinner parties, which Terry views as Bob aspiring to join the middle class. This results in Terry viewing Bob as a class traitor and believing his own army experience and solid working-class ethos gives him moral superiority. To a considerable degree the comedy is built on class warfare. Whereas Bob, Thelma and Terry&#x27;s sister Audrey have adapted to the various changes, Terry&#x27;s failure to adjust to the changes that have occurred during his seven years in the army result in him being left behind, a relic of the attitudes of the mid-1960s.
As implied in the lyrics to the programme&#x27;s theme song, the 1970s series plays on both lads&#x27; feelings of nostalgia for the lost days of their reckless youth. Both of them are depressed by the demolition of so many of the landmarks of their childhood, though Bob, who works for a construction firm, sometimes sees it as progress. Bob has also bought his own house on a new estate, further distancing him from his and Terry&#x27;s pasts. Reflecting the distinctions now separating the two young men, the opening credits show Terry waiting for a bus in the older and more industrial parts of the city, with Bob seen outside his new home with his own car in the modern surroundings of the Elm Lodge housing estate.

The conflict between what Bob had become, and what he saw himself as, led him to be impulsively inclined to follow the lead set by the more headstrong Terry, who led them recklessly into one scrape after another. Bob usually blamed his drinking, poor diet and reckless behaviour on Terry, a view with which Audrey and Thelma only too willingly agreed. This may have been true in part, but Bob needed little persuasion to stay out drinking with Terry or to behave accordingly. Bob does not actually move into his new house until after his wedding to Thelma due to fears of being judged by his new neighbours (although, in the final episode of the first series, both Bob and Thelma make it clear they have an active sex life), and for the first series lives with his mother. Terry lives with his parents (his father is never seen) in a 19th-century terrace, which he claims has far more character than Bob&#x27;s new house, where &quot;the only thing that tells you apart from your neighbours is the colour of your curtains&quot;.

Many of the thirteen episodes of the first series, aired in 1973, have a loose narrative thread. The early episodes focus on Terry&#x27;s return to civilian life following his discharge from the army, whereas later episodes focus on the planning for Bob and Thelma&#x27;s wedding. The second series, aired the following year, opens with a focus on the growing romance between Terry and Thelma&#x27;s sister Susan, partially continued from the first series. A four-episode storyline concerning Bob and Thelma&#x27;s brief separation begins near the later half of the series, and there are also several self-contained episodes.

==Theme song==

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Whatever Happened to You&quot;, was written by Mike Hugg (of Manfred Mann) and La Frenais and performed by Hugg&#x27;s session band, with session singer Tony Rivers supplying the lead vocals; released as a single under the name Highly Likely, the song reached number 35 in the UK Singles Chart in 1973. Hugg also wrote the theme tune to the spin-off 1976 feature film, &quot;Remember When&quot;.

==Changes in format and style from &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;==
Although &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; was a continuation of the earlier series and featured many of the same characters, the style and format had changed. Unlike the original show, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; was made in colour. Also, &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; had been quite &quot;stagey&quot; (in the theatrical sense) in its format, being studio bound with little in the way of location filming. The 1970s series made extensive use of location filming in and around the north-east. In terms of humour, the two shows are very different. &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; had been a broad comedy, full of jokes and obvious gags, whereas &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; used much subtler humour, derived from the dialogue and characterisation, often interspersed with sentimentality and even touches of pathos as the lads mourned or reflected on their lost past. Nostalgia was a strong thread running through the show. The lads frequently did ask each other the question in the show&#x27;s title, &quot;Whatever happened to us?&quot;, particularly during their more mellow moments in the pub.

==Episode guide==

===Series 1===
===Series 2===
==Radio series==
The thirteen episodes of Series 1 were adapted for radio, with the original television cast, and broadcast on Radio 4 between 30 July and 22 October 1975. This series is periodically re-broadcast in the &quot;classic comedy&quot; hour on digital radio channel BBC Radio 4 Extra.

==Context==
Before the 1970s series was made, the cast had already been reunited twice, in 1967 and 1968, to record sixteen of the original television scripts for two series (of eight episodes each) on BBC Radio, the scripts for which were adapted for radio by James Bolam.

To emphasise continuity, the opening section of the title credits at the start of each episode includes a short montage of black-and-white stills photos of Bob and Terry in scenes from the 1960s series, presented as if in a photograph album. The leather-bound photo album, which Bob gives Terry before the wedding, in the episode &quot;End of an Era&quot;, is also the one seen in the opening credits.

To avoid animosity over billing, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam were alternated in the opening credits, so that one week Bewes was billed first and the following week Bolam was. In the closing credits the billing was reversed, with whoever had been billed second in the opening credits being billed first.

Bewes maintained his connections with &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, appearing in a cameo role as the old newspaper seller in a 2002 ITV remake of the series&#x27; most popular episode, &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, starring Tyneside entertainers Ant and Dec, which aired under the title &quot;A Tribute to the Likely Lads&quot;.

In 1995 and 1996, the series was repeated in its entirety on BBC2. It went on to become a short-term staple of cable channels and was again shown on satellite and cable TV in 2008 and 2009. In April 2013, the first series began a repeat run on BBC Four, its first showing on terrestrial television since 1996. Both series and the feature film have also been released on DVD.

One of the most notable continuity points about the show is that Terry served in the Army for &quot;five years&quot;. However, there was a real-life gap of seven years between the end of the original series in 1966 and the sequel in 1973. Also, there are numerous references in the 1970s show to the Lads&#x27; shared adventures in 1967, plus citations of that year as the time when Terry was last in town. From the audience&#x27;s point of view, Terry was last heard in the radio series, broadcast during 1967 and 1968. Taken all together, it suggests Terry&#x27;s army service lasted for the five years from 1968 (i.e., the end of the radio series) to 1973.

Terry&#x27;s full name is Terence Daniel Collier, born 29 February 1944. Bob&#x27;s full name is Robert Andrew Scarborough Ferris, born a week earlier. These dates can be worked out from dialogue in the episode &quot;Birthday Boy&quot;. The &quot;Scarborough&quot; in Bob&#x27;s name is because he was conceived there (although this is contradicted in the opening flashback sequence in the 1976 feature film). However, Terry&#x27;s &quot;silver tankard&quot; joke in his best man&#x27;s speech at the end of Series 1 (in the episode &quot;End of an Era&quot;) seems to imply that he, not Bob, turned 21 first.

Terry is younger than his sisters Audrey (Sheila Fearn) and Linda (who is never seen). Their parents are Edith and Cyril Collier. Terry&#x27;s father is not seen in either series of the 1970s show. Bob&#x27;s father, Leslie, had died in the 1960s (as established in the 1960s episode &quot;Friends and Neighbours&quot;). Terry&#x27;s dad is neither dead nor absent; he is continually referred to in the 1970s series, and also in the feature film, appeared in the 1960s series but is never actually seen (although, in the opening flashback in the film, a back view of him is briefly visible, which is clearly James Bolam, and Bolam also provides the voice-over dialogue in that scene). Bob&#x27;s mother, Alice, occasionally appears; Terry&#x27;s mother Edith (Olive Milbourne) is frequently seen in the 1973 series.

Thelma&#x27;s full maiden name is Thelma Ingrid Chambers. Thelma&#x27;s father, played by Bill Owen, is George Chambers. Her younger sister is Susan, who lives in Toronto, Canada, with her accountant fiancé Peter.

The lads attended Park Infants School, Park Junior School and Park Secondary Modern. Thelma was with them for infants and juniors, but then went to the grammar school. One of Bob&#x27;s most notable school romances is the often mentioned but never seen: Deirdre Birchwood, who was the basis of a running joke in Series 1, where any mention of her (or of any other former girlfriend of Bob&#x27;s) was guaranteed to upset Thelma. (A Deirdre Birchwood actually appears in an episode of the Bewes vehicle, &quot;Dear Mother...Love Albert&quot; and is referred to in many episodes of that programme. Her name comes from a little girl Bewes knew in real life; he was reunited with her on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.) The lads were also in the Scouts together.

Bob lost his virginity to Wendy Thwaite, according to the Series 1 episode &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget Whatshername&quot;, who scored eight stars (out of seven) on his scoring system.

Terry&#x27;s West German wife was Jutta Baumgarten. The couple married in November 1969 but separated in June 1970 after West Germany defeated England 3–2 in the World Cup. Confusingly, Terry later says they were married for two years &quot;on and off&quot;, which further clouds the continuity issue of Terry&#x27;s time away. She was due to appear in the episode &quot;End of an Era&quot;, played by April Walker, but the scenes featuring her were omitted from the broadcast version.

Terry&#x27;s address is given in dialogue as 127 Inkerman Terrace (&quot;No Hiding Place&quot;); but external shots (in &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;) clearly show a different house number. Bob and Thelma live at house number 8 of an unspecified avenue on The Elm Lodge Housing Estate (the house in the opening titles is on Agincourt at the Highfields estate in Killingworth).

Bob&#x27;s immediate neighbours at his new house are the Lawsons and the Jeffcotes, again never seen in the show. A couple called the Nortons are also later referred to as living next door.

It is revealed (in the episode &quot;Storm in a Tea Chest&quot;) that the boys used to be in a skiffle group called Rob Ferris and the Wildcats. Other group members included Maurice &quot;Memphis&quot; Hardaker, named after a real-life friend of the show&#x27;s co-creator and co-writer Ian La Frenais.

The lads&#x27; workmate from the 1960s series, Cloughie (played by Bartlett Mullins), does not appear, but it is mentioned in the first episode that he now runs a newsagents.

Two aspects of the show are never fully explained; Terry&#x27;s supposedly injured leg, which he claims to have injured in the army (&quot;I never talk about it&quot;), and his dislike of being referred to as &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;slim&quot;, preferring to describe himself as &quot;wiry&quot;. The latter is, in fact, a continuation of a running gag in the original 1960s series, in which Terry was paranoid about being thought &quot;weedy&quot;.

The pubs frequented by the lads include The Black Horse (which is their most regular &quot;local&quot;, featuring landlord Jack and barmaid Gloria), The Fat Ox, The Drift Inn and The Wheatsheaf. Others mentioned in passing include The Swan, The Ship, The Institute and The Railway Club.

Friends of the Lads who are regularly spoken of but never seen include Frank Clark (Bob&#x27;s original choice for best man, who had the same name as a Newcastle United player of the time), and Nigel &quot;Little Hutch&quot; Hutchinson (a sex-mad pal, who frequently has a racing tip for Terry). A new friend of Bob&#x27;s, affable Londoner Alan Boyle (Julian Holloway), appears in &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; and &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot; with his wife Brenda.

The episodes &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget Whatshername&quot; and &quot;Storm in a Tea Chest&quot; were based in part on elements in the 1960s episode &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;

The titles for the 1974 Christmas Special call the show simply &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;. The opening scenes are set in late September, on the day of Terry&#x27;s successful driving test.

Exterior shots were filmed on Tyneside and around the north-east, while interiors were shot at the BBC Television Centre in London.

The genuine affection held by Clement and La Frenais for the golden age of films is reflected in the programme. For instance, nearly all of the episode titles (from &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; to &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;) are based on the titles of well-known films; and the script frequently features jokes about popular films (such as Terry&#x27;s dig at Bob, on learning that he is becoming middle class, that his new friends include &quot;Bob and Carole, and Ted and Alice&quot; – a reference to the 1969 film of that name).

The BBC decided not to commission a third series of the show, partly because Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais had written a pilot script for another 1973 series, entitled &quot;Seven of One&quot;, in which Ronnie Barker appeared in seven different situations from different writers, each of which was a try-out for a possible series. The BBC decided they liked one by Clement and La Frenais, who found themselves suddenly offered a new series, starring Barker, which became the television comedy &quot;Porridge&quot;.

Writing and production for the new show, which debuted in the autumn of 1974 and ran for three series, made it difficult to schedule a further series of &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;. Instead, Clement and La Frenais began to develop a one-off script, which became &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; feature film, which was eventually made in 1976.

==Home media==

The complete first and second series of the 1970s show (including the Christmas special) were available in the UK on Region 2 DVD.

==Feature film==

In 1976 a feature-length film was released, written by Clement and La Frenais, which was directed by Michael Tuchner. By this time, Terry had moved to a high-rise flat and also has a Finnish girlfriend called Christina (&quot;Chris&quot;), played by Mary Tamm. Both Mary Tamm and James Bolam&#x27;s wife Susan Jameson appeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with Tom Baker. 

The film opened with the lads lamenting the demolition of one of their favourite pubs, The Fat Ox, before they go on a caravanning holiday with Thelma and Chris. The complications resulting from the trip lead to Terry and Chris splitting up, as a result of which Terry decides to emigrate, signing on as a crewman on a cargo ship.

Bob and Terry sneak one last late-night drink together aboard Terry&#x27;s ship, anchored in the docks; but Terry has second thoughts, and disembarks the next morning. Bob, however, awakes, hung over, aboard the ship, as it sails for Bahrain. This was a reversal of the ending of the original 1960s show (in which Terry was missing Bob who had joined the Army, so he joined up too, only to discover that Bob had been discharged with flat feet).

==&quot;A Tribute to the Likely Lads&quot;==
In 2002, the episode &quot;No Hiding Place&quot; was remade by Ginger Productions for ITV, featuring Declan Donnelly as Bob and Ant McPartlin as Terry, and Rodney Bewes in a cameo role. Reception was lukewarm: most critics agreed that, on paper, the pair were perfectly cast, but that they seemed too young to play Bob and Terry at that point in their lives.

==Stage version==
In 2008, The Gala Theatre in Durham staged the world premiere of &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, adapted for the stage by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Simon Stallworthy. The title roles of Bob and Terry were played by David Nellist and Scott Frazer respectively.

In May 2011, The Tynemouth Priory Theatre, in Tynemouth, were granted the rights to become the first non-professional company to stage the production. It became one of the theatre&#x27;s most attended productions, selling out well in advance for all performances. Terry was played by Brendan Egan and Bob by Stu Bowman.

==In popular culture==
* The title song &quot;Whatever Happened to You?&quot; was recorded and released as a single, sung by Highly Likely. It was also released as a single by the British punk band Snuff, entitled &quot;Christmas Single&quot;.
* Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant have said the show was an influence on &quot;The Office&quot;.
* English indie rock band The Libertines released a song titled “What Became Of The Likely Lads”; it is the closing track on their self-titled second album.

<text>The American Museum and Gardens (formerly American Museum in Britain) is a museum of American art and culture based at Claverton, near Bath, England. Its collections of American furniture, quilts and folk art are displayed in a Grade I listed 19th-century house, surrounded by gardens overlooking the valley of the River Avon.

== Claverton Manor ==
The country house was designed for John Vivian, a barrister who had purchased the manor in 1816, by Jeffry Wyatville in 1819–20. It stands on the steep west slope of the Avon valley, above the Claverton village, and is about east of the centre of Bath.

The house has three storeys and is built in ashlar. Its east elevation, overlooking the river valley, has full-height bows flanking three central bays with a projecting square porch, above it two Ionic columns in antis. The south elevation has five bays, the central three embellished with Ionic pilasters under a pediment bearing the Vivian arms. A tall screen wall to the south has urns on pedestals, and a six-bay north wing containing service rooms has similar decoration. The building and walls were designated as Grade I listed in 1956. A two-storey coach house and stables were built to the south of the house, also in ashlar, around 1820.

Earlier owners of the estate include Sir Edward Hungerford (d.1607), a Member of Parliament, and (from 1609) Martin Bassett, whose son William (d.1656) and grandson William (d.1693) were also MPs. In 1758 it was bought by Ralph Allen, owner of Bath stone quarries, and in 1816 by John Vivian, who replaced the earlier manor house (near Claverton church) with the present house on its elevated site. Vivian&#x27;s second son George, an artist and traveller, developed the gardens and added the screen walls.

The estate had a succession of owners after it was sold by the Vivian family in 1869, and during the ownership of the Skrine family the gardens were in 1897 the venue for the first public speech by Winston Churchill. The house was the headquarters of an RAF barrage balloon group during the Second World War. John Judkyn and Dallas Pratt, co-founders of the museum, bought the house and grounds in 1958.

== Museum ==
The museum was founded by two antique collectors: Dallas Pratt (1914 – 1994), an American psychiatrist from New York and heir to a substantial Standard Oil fortune; and his lifelong partner John Judkyn (1913 – 1963), a British designer and antiques dealer who took American citizenship. The museum was opened to the public for the first time on July 1, 1961, and remains the only museum devoted to American decorative arts outside the boundaries of the United States. The museum&#x27;s mission today stays true to the ambitions of its founders; to increase knowledge of American cultural history in order to strengthen the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.

The museum remains a popular attraction, with well over 3 million visitors in total by 2012. The former coach house is used by the museum for weddings and other functions.

Richard Wendorf, an American literary scholar and librarian, was Director of the Museum between 2010 and 2021.

== Collection and exhibitions ==
The museum collection is displayed in the manor house and includes a variety of American cultural artefacts, decorative arts and antiques, as well as a series of Period Rooms covering a historical period from circa 1690 to 1860. These rooms are reconstructions of those from a variety of historic American interiors, including a late seventeenth-century Puritan home, an eighteenth-century tavern, and a sumptuous New Orleans bedroom dating from around the eve of the American Civil War in 1860. The museum&#x27;s collection also includes world renowned Shaker furniture, an extensive collection of over 200 quilts and textiles (50 of which are on permanent display), a collection of over 200 antique historical maps, and the most significant collection of American folk art in Europe. The museum collection includes works by a variety of artists, such as Susan Powers as well as the portraitists John Brewster, Jr., Ammi Phillips and William Matthew Prior. There are also carved eagles by Wilhelm Schimmel and Frederick Myrick.

The museum also hosts a different exhibition every year exploring more recent American history. Recent temporary exhibitions have included The Colourful World of Kaffe Fassett and Shooting Stars: Britain and America in the 1970s (featuring the photography of Carinthia West). These exhibitions are situated in the museum&#x27;s external gallery, located in a separate building to the manor house. The museum&#x27;s gift shop is also located in this building.

== Garden ==
The grounds of the museum are set within the wider landscape of the valley of the River Avon and has fine views over the valley towards the village of Limpley Stoke and the Kennet and Avon Canal. Garden features include a small grotto with a water spout.

The museum gardens include extensive renovated areas representing trends in both English landscape and American garden design. The American Museum originally employed Lanning Roper to design a mixed border, but since the museum opened in 1961, the 30 acres around the house have been developed to include a replica of George Washington’s garden at Mount Vernon, as well as a Lewis and Clark trail, and an arboretum that includes a collection of American trees.

The Mount Vernon Garden, which is a re-creation of a part of George Washington&#x27;s garden at Mount Vernon, is situated away from the house on the site of a former Italianate garden and was opened on June 26, 1962. In 2018 the Mount Vernon Garden was restored to replicate more closely the original layout implemented by George Washington.

With the addition of the New American Garden, officially opened on September 15, 2018, as part of a £2 million project to renovate the lawn and herb gardens immediately adjacent to the manor house, the museum grounds now boast the largest collection of American horticultural features in the United Kingdom. This project was the first European commission for the American landscape architects based in Washington D.C., Oehme van Sweden (OvS). The planting in the New American Garden follows the free-form style made famous by the firm&#x27;s founders, Wolfgang Oehme and James van Sweden. Native American shrubs, perennials, and bulbs feature heavily, but the garden is designed to work with the steep terrain and enhance the view over the Limpley Stoke Valley, which is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The new garden path, known as The Winding Way, is a fully accessible pathway encircling the lawns and American Rose Collection, as well as the natural amphitheatre, which has become the museum&#x27;s outdoor theatre and events space.

== Governance ==
The museum is run by a registered charity, overseen by a board of trustees. It was established by a trust deed in 1959, registered as a charity in 1968 and re-registered in 2004.

<doc id="89309" wikidata="Q391087" url="?curid=89309" title="Battle of Cynoscephalae">
<text>The Battle of Cynoscephalae () was an encounter battle fought in Thessaly in 197 BC between the Roman army, led by Titus Quinctius Flamininus, and the Antigonid dynasty of Macedon, led by Philip V, during the Second Macedonian War. It was a decisive Roman victory and marked the end of the conflict.

==Background==
The First Macedonian War (started due to an alliance between Macedon and Carthage against the Romans during the Second Punic War in 215 BC) had ended in a stalemate; between the Roman alliance with Aetolia and the destruction of the Macedonian fleet early in the war, the Macedonians were unable to support Carthage and were forced into a defensive stance. A truce was signed between Macedonia and Rome in 205 BC leading to an uneasy peace. The Second Punic War would end not long after in 201 BC. Although Macedonia had limited effect in the Second Punic War, their alliance with Carthage would earn the ire of the Romans.

In 202 BC, the Fifth Syrian War would break out, with the Macedonians allying with the Seleucids in a pact to carve up Asia Minor. Philip&#x27;s moves towards the city states in Thrace, around the Dardanelles and later actions towards Rhodes and the Kingdom of Pergamum greatly disconcerted the two states. Although Rhodes and the Kingdom of Pergamum would later gain the upper hand against Philip, with a crushing defeat of his navy at the Battle of Chios, they were still concerned enough about Macedon to send envoys to Rome to try and convince them to join the war. Rome in turn sent envoys to Greece to form an anti-Macedonian coalition, which Philip took as a sign of weakness from Rome due to the fact the Second Punic War had only just ended. When Philip failed to give up on further conquests in the region, the Roman Senate and Assembly declared war, beginning the Second Macedonian War.

On 15 March 198 BC, new consuls took office, with command in Macedonia being handed to Titus Quinctius Flamininus. After arriving in Greece, Flamininus went to have a meeting with Philip to discuss the terms of peace, demanding nothing less than the complete withdrawal of Macedonian forces from all of Greece outside of the Macedonian homeland. Philip stormed out of the meeting, after which Flamininus began his campaign.

By the start of 197 BC, Philip had lost most of his earlier conquests and had been set back to Macedonia and parts of Thessaly. In the spring of that year, Flamininus brought his army to Thessaly, with Philip marching his army south to meet him. The two initially camped nearby the city of Pherae, holding skirmishes there. However, Philip&#x27;s army was in need of food and level ground in order to deploy his phalanx (something the terrain was unsuitable for at Pherae), so he began marching his army westward towards the small town of Scotussa for its grain stores. They marched on the northern side of the slopes while the Romans followed on the southern side, these slopes being the Cynoscephalae Hills.

== Armies ==

===Romans===
Flamininus had about 26,000 men, consisting of two full legions with the support of 6,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from the Aetolian League and an additional 1,200 men under Amynander of Athamania. He also commanded war elephants from Numidia. Reinforcements from Italy brought Flamininus an additional 6,000 infantry, 300 cavalry and 3,000 marines.

===Macedonians===
Philip had about 25,500 men of which 16,000 were phalangites levied from across the kingdom consisting of wildly varying ages from young boys to aged veterans, due primarily to the perpetual wars creating a lack of manpower. Alongside this, there were 2,000 peltasts (light infantry) with an additional 4,000 men from the Thracians and Trallians, 1,500 mercenaries and 2,000 cavalry.

The Thessalian cavalry was led by Heracleides of Gyrton and the Macedonian cavalry by Leon. The mercenaries (except the Thracians) were commanded by Athenagoras of Macedon and the second infantry corps by Nicanor the Elephant.

== Battle ==

During the march there was a heavy rainstorm, and the morning after there was a fog over the hills and fields separating both camps. Despite fearing an ambush, Philip&#x27;s force was in desperate need of supplies; thus Philip resumed his march, however his troops soon became confused and disoriented due to the heavy fog. For this reason, Philip decided to instead pitch camp but did still send out half his heavy infantry to search for food. To offset the inherent risk, Philip also sent his light infantry and half of his cavalry in order to take the Cynoscephalae Hills and locate the Roman force. Flamininus, likewise unaware of Philip&#x27;s location, sent 1,000 light infantry and 300 cavalry to try and locate their forces, resulting in an engagement with Philip&#x27;s troops on the hills.

In the thick fog that had gathered on the hills, the light infantry of both forces stumbled into each other, with the limited visibility resulting in a confused battle of hand to hand combat as opposed to the usual hurling of javelins before the enemy could get too close. Then, the cavalry that both sides had sent up with their reconnaissance forces became involved in the fight, with the Romans slowly being overpowered due to being outnumbered by Philip&#x27;s forces. The Roman force soon requested aid from Flamininus.

Flamininus reinforced them by sending 2,000 light infantry and 500 cavalry, sending so few because of the fog still hanging over the battlefield, effectively blinding him to what was happening; he was unable to send the rest of his force until he could be sure as to how many Macedonians were involved and where they were. Despite their limited numbers, these reinforcements gave the Romans the upper hand, with the Macedonians now being driven back to the peaks of the Cynoscephalae and away from level ground. Messengers were sent to Philip requesting reinforcements, but he realised that the entire Roman force could be waiting for him to attack. Additionally, half of his heavy infantry had not returned from foraging for food. As such, he didn&#x27;t send any additional forces until the fog began to clear and the Macedonian situation became clear to him, now showing that only Roman light infantry and cavalry were involved. Philip sent one of his officers, Athenagoras, along with 1,500 mercenary heavy infantry and 1,500 heavy cavalry. This forced the Romans into a retreat off the summit, however they were not completely pushed off the hills due to the Aetolian cavalry. The battle soon became a static fight on the plains outside the Roman camp.

Philip received exaggerated reports of this retreat by the Roman reconnaissance force, believing that his troops had routed the entire Roman force. Though reluctant to send his phalanx into the broken, hilly terrain, as a result of the glowing reports from his forces he ordered an assault by 8,000 phalangites and 4,000 peltasts. He then instructed Nicanor to ready the rest of the returning phalangites and assist him as soon as he could.

The presence of such a force in front of his camp caused Flamininus to lead the rest of his force out of his camp, forming them into a battle line and placing his war elephants to the front of his right wing. The spaced organisation of the Roman maniple allowed the retreating Romans to escape the Macedonians, who in turn fell back at the sight of the Roman battle lines forming up. Flamininus commanded from his left legion and advanced with it, leaving his right in reserve.

Philip, now realising the reports were exaggerated, arrived just as his forces were retreating back up the hill. Knowing any attempt at a retreat would result in disaster, Philip rallied the retreating troops as they came to the top of the ridge, forming them on the right of his formation. He then formed the peltasts to the left of his cavalry, and his phalangites to the left of the peltasts, then forming a peltast line 16-men deep and a phalangite line 36-men deep. Unable to wait for Nicanor to arrive, Philip sent his right phalanx into the Roman left wing, driving them down the ridge, albeit at a slow pace.

While this was going on, the Macedonian left led by Nicanor was arriving piecemeal at the top of the ridge. Seeing Nicanor&#x27;s disorganised troops, Flamininus rode to his right wing and ordered them to attack; his elephants lead the force which included their Italian allies and 4,000 Greek infantry. Still in a column march, with others struggling to get up the hills, the war elephants smashed into the disorganised Macedonian left, scattering them and sending them back down the hill with the Romans in pursuit.

As this pursuit was ongoing, an unnamed tribune, upon realising their position at the exposed rear of the Macedonian right wing, detached 20 maniples (approximately 2,500 infantry) and sent them into the rear of the Macedonian phalanx. Being quickly cut down due to the inflexibility of the formation, the Macedonian phalanx disintegrated. Some were simply killed where they stood, others pointed their sarissas directly upwards in a sign of surrender that the Romans either ignored or failed to understand. Thus, the slaughter continued, only being stopped due to the intervention of Flamininus.

Phillip, along with a small number of cavalry, had pulled back to the summit for a better look at the battle, only to see the collapse of his right wing and the rout of his left. It was then that he fled the battle with his escort, returning to Macedonian territory. Plutarch would later say;

== Aftermath ==
According to Polybius and Livy, 8,000 Macedonians had been killed. Livy mentions that other sources claim 32,000 Macedonians were killed and even one writer who due to &quot;boundless exaggeration&quot; claims 40,000 but concludes that Polybius is the trustworthy source on this matter. Flamininus also took 5,000 prisoners. The Romans only lost between 700 and 750 men in the battle.

It is generally perceived that with the later Battle of Pydna, this defeat demonstrated the superiority of the Roman legion over the Macedonian phalanx. The phalanx, though very powerful head on, was not as flexible as the Roman manipular formation and thus unable to adapt to changing conditions on the battlefield or break away from an engagement if necessary. This assertion has been challenged by some who point out that the Romans were only able to attain victory by taking advantage of the fact that the Macedonian left wing was not fully formed, although this is also given as evidence of the phalanx&#x27;s unwieldy nature when compared to the legion. 

In any case, the result of the battle of Cynoscephalae was a fatal blow to the political aspirations of the Macedonian kingdom; Macedonia would never again be in a position to challenge Rome&#x27;s geopolitical expansion. Although the peace that followed in 196 BC allowed Philip to keep his kingdom intact, Philip was forced to; 

* Relinquish his earlier conquests and return to the borders of the Macedonian homeland
* Remove all of his garrisons outside of Macedonia (in order to make those nations free and autonomous, to be done before the Isthmian Games of 196 BC)
* Pay an indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to Rome (half of which was to be paid immediately, the other in 10 annual instalments of 50 talents) 
* Give up all but 5-10 of his decked ships
* Only hold an army of 5,000 soldiers (which could contain no elephants) 
* Not conduct war beyond the borders of Macedonia without the permission of the Roman Senate

Plutarch also stated that they took one of Philip&#x27;s sons, Demetrius, as a hostage;

However, 5 years later he was released to Philip due to the assistance given by Macedonia to Rome during the war against the Seleucids;

At the Isthmian Games in 196 BC, Flamininus would announce that all Greek states previously controlled by Philip were now free and independent of his rule.

<text>Nordfriesland (; ; Low German: Noordfreesland), also known as North Frisia, is the northernmost district of Germany, part of the state of Schleswig-Holstein. It includes almost all of traditional North Frisia (with the exception of the island of Heligoland), as well as adjacent parts of the Schleswig Geest to the east and Stapelholm to the south, and is bounded (from the east and clockwise) by the districts of Schleswig-Flensburg and Dithmarschen, the North Sea and the Danish county of South Jutland. The district is called &quot;Kreis Nordfriesland&quot; in German, &quot;Kreis Noordfreesland&quot; in Low German, &quot;Kris Nordfraschlönj&quot; in Mooring North Frisian, &quot;Kreis Nuurdfresklun&quot; in Fering North Frisian and &quot;Nordfrislands amt&quot; in Danish.

As of 2008, Nordfriesland was the most visited rural district in Germany.

==History==

The sea has always had a strong influence in the region. In medieval times, storm tides made life in what is now Nordfriesland rather dangerous. Only in modern times was the loss of land and lives able to be stopped by building solid dikes. Many villages that once existed are now at the bottom of the sea. The best-known example is the small seaport of Rungholt, which was destroyed by a storm surge in 1362. The island of Strand vanished in the Burchardi flood, another disastrous storm in 1634. Subsequent to this storm surge, there were many small islets instead of Strand.

From approximately 1200 until 1864, the area that is now Nordfriesland was a part of the Duchy of Schleswig, which itself was not directly a part of the Danish Kingdom, but a fiefdom of the Danish crown and linked to the kings of Denmark by personal union as a separate entity. Nordfriesland is still a multilingual district: there are people speaking standard German, Low German, North Frisian and Danish including South Jutlandic. The North Frisian language exists in nine slightly different dialects, yet it is mainly used by older citizens in mainland Nordfriesland. A relatively lively community of Frisian speakers exists though on the islands of Föhr and Amrum. After becoming German, three districts were established in the region: Südtondern in the north, Husum in the centre, and Eiderstedt in the south. In 1970 these three districts were merged to form the Nordfriesland district.

==Geography==
The entire coastal region is part of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. Nordfriesland includes the coastal section between Dithmarschen and Denmark. In the south is the Eiderstedt peninsula, where the River Eider meets the sea.

The North Frisian Islands are also part of the Nordfriesland district and located inside the national park as well. There are five large islands (Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, Pellworm and Nordstrand) and ten smaller islets known as Halligen.

<text>The North Frisian Islands (&quot;Öömrang&quot; and &quot;Fering&quot; , &quot;Söl&#x27;ring&quot; , , ) are the Frisian Islands off the coast of North Frisia.

The term covers both the North Frisian Islands in the narrow sense (in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany) and the Danish Wadden Sea Islands (in Denmark). However, culturally and linguistically, the Danish islands are usually not reckoned as being part of North Frisia, since they are not inhabited by native speakers of the North Frisian language. Occasionally, the remote island of Heligoland is also included in this group for reasons of administrative convenience, despite not being located in the Wadden Sea, since the island is home to its own unique dialect of Frisian.

== History ==

After the Frisian and Danish colonisation of the islands in the 8th century, the Frisian-populated hundreds (between Eiderstedt and Sylt) became the Uthlande. The North Frisians in the Uthlande were ruled directly by the Danish king and were known as &quot;Königsfriesen&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Frisians&quot;. Only later did the Uthlande transfer to the Duchy of Schleswig, with the exception of small Danish royal enclaves. Part of Rømø was also ruled by the Schleswig duke. After the German-Danish wars, the islands from Nordstrand to Rømø became Prussian in 1866. After the referendum in 1920, the current border between the islands of Sylt and Rømø was fixed.

A good and thorough overview of the life, work, languages, costumes and customs of the island Frisians is portrayed by the Carl Haeberlin Frisian Museum in Wyk auf Föhr.

== Islands ==
There are four larger islands and ten tiny islets. The names of the large islands are Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and Pellworm. The islets are called &quot;Halligen&quot;. In medieval times, the present-day peninsula Nordstrand and Pellworm as well as the Halligen were part of the large island of Strand. This island was torn to pieces in a disastrous storm tide in 1634.

Sylt (&quot;Söl&#x27;ring&quot; North Frisian: &quot;Söl&#x27; &quot;; ) is the largest of the North Frisian Islands, consisting of about 100 km². It is accessible by a causeway called the &quot;Hindenburgdamm&quot;; this causeway is only accessible to trains. In the summer months, the island is crowded with tourists, including those who have a preference for nudism. Sylt&#x27;s image is that of a meeting point for the jet-set. The main town on the island is Westerland. The northern end of Sylt, the &quot;Ellenbogen&quot; (&quot;elbow&quot;), is Germany&#x27;s northernmost point. Lager Sylt, the Nazi concentration camp on Alderney, was named after the island.

Compared with Sylt, Föhr (&quot;Fering&quot; North Frisian: &quot;Feer&quot;; ) is a relatively silent island. Its area is 82 km². Sixteen old hamlets are scattered over the island, some of which already existed in the 13th century. The main town is Wyk on the south eastern shore. Wyk is a popular German seaside resort. There is no bridge or causeway connecting Föhr and the mainland, so ferries are the only connection. The ferry port, the harbour and Föhr marina are in Wyk.

Amrum (&quot;Öömrang&quot; North Frisian: &quot;Oomram&quot;) is only 20 km², but it is popular with tourists, though less crowded than Sylt. The western half of the island features a beach 12 km in length and 1 km in width. The villages are situated on the eastern shore, with Wittdün being the most important of them.

Pellworm (North Frisian &quot;Polweerm&quot;; &quot;Mooring&quot; North Frisian: &quot;Pälweerm&quot;; ) and the peninsula of Nordstrand (&quot;Mooring&quot;: &quot;Nordströön&quot;) are the remains of the submerged island of Strand. The main town of this sunken island was Rungholt, thought to be the largest town in the surrounding area, but it was totally destroyed and submerged by a storm in 1362, 272 years before another storm destroyed Strand itself. Nordstrand has an area of 49 km², Pellworm 37 km².

Smaller remains of Strand are the ten islets called Halligen. The houses on these tiny islets are built on artificial hills. In a storm tide only these hills rise above the sea, while the remainder of the islet is flooded. The names of the &quot;Halligen&quot; are Nordmarsch-Langeness, Norderoog, Süderoog, Nordstrandischmoor, Oland, Südfall, Gröde-Appelland, Hooge, Habel and the Hamburger Hallig.

West off the Halligen, three drying sandbanks form the so-called North Frisian Barrier Islands: Japsand, Norderoogsand and Süderoogsand.

<text>In classical music, a piano quintet is a work of chamber music written for piano and four other instruments, most commonly (since 1842) a string quartet (i.e., two violins, viola, and cello). The term also refers to the group of musicians that plays a piano quintet. The genre flourished during the nineteenth century.

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, most piano quintets were scored for piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Following the success of Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quintet in E major, Op. 44 in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet, composers increasingly adopted Schumann&#x27;s instrumentation, and it was this form of the piano quintet that dominated during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.

Among the best known and most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann&#x27;s, are Schubert&#x27;s Trout quintet and the piano quintets of Johannes Brahms, César Franck, Antonín Dvořák and Dmitri Shostakovich.

==The piano quintet before 1842==
While the related chamber music genres of the piano trio and piano quartet were established in the eighteenth century by Mozart and others, the piano quintet did not come into its own until the nineteenth century. Its roots extend into the late Classical period, when piano concertos were sometimes transcribed for piano with string quartet accompaniment.

Although Luigi Boccherini composed quintets for piano and string quartet, before 1842 it was more common for the piano to be joined by violin, viola, cello and double bass. Among the best known quintets for this combination of instruments are Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Trout&quot; Quintet in A major (1819) and Johann Nepomuk Hummel&#x27;s Piano Quintet in E-flat minor, Op.87 (1802). Other piano quintets using this instrumentation were composed by Jan Ladislav Dussek (1799), Ferdinand Ries (1817), Johann Baptist Cramer (1825, 1832), Henri Jean Rigel (1826), Johann Peter Pixis (ca.1827), Franz Limmer (1832), Louise Farrenc (1839, 1840), and George Onslow (1846, 1848, 1849).

Mozart (in 1784) and Ludwig van Beethoven (in 1796) each composed a quintet for piano and winds, scored for piano, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, that are sometimes referred to as piano quintets.

==Schumann and the Romantic piano quintet==

In the middle of the 19th century, Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quintet in E major, Op. 44 (1842), composed for piano with string quartet, helped establish that combination of instruments as the typical model for the piano quintet. Schumann&#x27;s choice of scoring reflected developments in musical performance and instrumental design.

By midcentury, the string quartet was regarded as the most prestigious and important chamber music genre, while advances in the design of the piano had expanded its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann&#x27;s piano quintet took full advantage of the expressive possibilities of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with passages in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. In Schumann&#x27;s hands, the piano quintet became a genre &quot;suspended between private and public spheres&quot; alternating between &quot;quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements&quot;—well suited to an era when chamber music was increasingly being performed in large concert halls rather than at private gatherings in intimate spaces.

Schumann&#x27;s quintet helped establish the piano quintet as a significant chamber music genre during the Romantic period in classical music. It was immediately acclaimed and widely imitated. Johannes Brahms, for example, was persuaded by Clara Schumann (who had played the piano part in the first public performance of her husband&#x27;s piano quintet) to rework a sonata for two pianos as a piano quintet. The result, the Piano Quintet in F minor (1864), is one of the most frequently performed works of the genre.

Subsequent compositions such as César Franck&#x27;s Piano Quintet in F minor (1879) and Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Piano Quintet #2 in A major, Op. 81 (1887) further solidified the genre as a &quot;vehicle for Romantic expression.&quot;

==20th century==
In the twentieth century, the piano quintet repertoire was expanded with contributions by composers such as Béla Bartók, Sergei Taneyev, Louis Vierne, Edward Elgar, Amy Beach, Gabriel Fauré, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Mieczysław Weinberg. However, unlike the string quartet, which remained an important chamber music genre for musical experimentation, the piano quintet came to acquire &quot;a somewhat conservative profile, far from major developments&quot; in musical expression.

<text>A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op, or coop) is &quot;an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled &quot;. Cooperatives are democratically controlled by their members, with each member having one vote in electing the board of directors. They differ from collectives in that they are generally built from the bottom-up, rather than the top-down.
Cooperatives may include:
* Worker cooperatives: businesses owned and managed by the people who work there
* Consumer cooperatives: businesses owned and managed by the people who consume goods and/or services provided by the cooperative
* Producer cooperatives: businesses where producers pool their output for their common benefit
** e.g. Agricultural cooperatives
* Purchasing cooperatives where members pool their purchasing power
* Multi-stakeholder or hybrid cooperatives that share ownership between different stakeholder groups. For example, care cooperatives where ownership is shared between both care-givers and receivers. Stakeholders might also include non-profits or investors.
* Second- and third-tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives
* Platform cooperatives that use a cooperatively owned and governed website, mobile app or a protocol to facilitate the sale of goods and services.

The Research published by the Worldwatch Institute found that in 2012 approximately one billion people in 96 countries had become members of at least one cooperative. The turnover of the largest three hundred cooperatives in the world reached $2.2 trillion.

Worker cooperatives are typically more productive and economically resilient than many other forms of enterprise, with twice the number of co-operatives (80%) surviving their first five years compared with other business ownership models (44%) according to data from United Kingdom. The largest worker owned cooperative in the world, the Mondragon Corporation (founded by Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta), has been in continuous operation since 1956.

Cooperatives frequently have social goals, which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. As an example of this, in 2013, retail co-operatives in the UK invested 6.9% of their pre-tax profits in the communities in which they trade, compared to 2.4% for rival supermarkets.

Since 2002, cooperatives have been distinguishable on the Internet through the use of a .coop domain. In 2014, the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) introduced the Cooperative Marque, meaning ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions can also be identified through a coop ethical consumerism label.

== Origins and history ==

Cooperation dates back as far as human beings have been organizing for mutual benefits. Tribes were organized as cooperative structures, allocating jobs and resources among each other, only trading with the external communities. In alpine environments, trade could only be maintained in organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such as Viamala in 1472. Pre-industrial Europe is home to the first cooperatives from an industrial context. The roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple influences and extend worldwide. In the English-speaking world, post-feudal forms of cooperation between workers and owners that are expressed today as &quot;profit sharing&quot; and &quot;surplus sharing&quot; arrangements existed as far back as 1795. The key ideological influence on the Anglosphere branch of the cooperative movement, however, was a &quot;rejection&quot; of the charity principles that underpinned welfare reforms when the British government radically revised its Poor Laws in 1834. As both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish between the &#x27;deserving&#x27; and &#x27;undeserving&#x27; poor, a movement of friendly societies grew throughout the British Empire based on the principle of mutuality, committed to self-help in the welfare of working people.
In 1761, the Fenwick Weavers&#x27; Society was formed in Fenwick, East Ayrshire, Scotland to sell discounted oatmeal to local workers. Its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans, emigration and education. In 1810, Welsh social reformer Robert Owen, from Newtown in mid-Wales, and his partners purchased the New Lanark mill from Owen&#x27;s father-in-law, David Dale, and proceeded to introduce better labour standards, including discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees. Owen left New Lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop coop ideas through writing and lecture. Cooperative communities were set up in Glasgow, Indiana and Hampshire, although ultimately unsuccessful. In 1828, William King set up a newspaper, &quot;The Cooperator&quot;, to promote Owen&#x27;s thinking, having already set up a cooperative store in Brighton.

Also in 1810, Rev. Henry Duncan of the Ruthwell Presbyterian Church in Dumfriesshire, Scotland founded a friendly society to create a cooperative depository institution at which his poorest parishioners could hold savings accounts accruing interest for sickness and old-age, which was the first established savings bank that would be merged into the Trustee Savings Bank between 1970 and 1985. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, founded in 1844, is usually considered the first successful cooperative enterprise, used as a model for modern coops, following the &#x27;Rochdale Principles&#x27;. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans in Rochdale, England set up the society to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over a thousand cooperative societies in the United Kingdom.
&quot;Spolok Gazdovský&quot; (&quot;The Association of Administrators&quot; or &quot;The Association of Farmers&quot;) founded in 1845 by Samuel Jurkovič, was the first cooperative in Europe (Credit union). The cooperative provided a cheap loan from funds generated by regular savings for members of the cooperative. Members of cooperative had to commit to a moral life and had to plant two trees in a public place every year. Despite the short duration of its existence, until 1851, it thus formed the basis of the cooperative movement in Slovakia. Slovak national thinker Ľudovít Štúr said about the association: &quot;We would very much like such excellent constitutions to be established throughout our region. They would help to rescue people from evil and misery. A beautiful, great idea, a beautiful excellent constitution!&quot;

Other events such as the founding of a friendly society by the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1832 were key occasions in the creation of organized labor and consumer movements.

Friendly Societies established forums through which one member, one vote was practiced in organisation decision-making. The principles challenged the idea that a person should be an owner of property before being granted a political voice. Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (and then repeatedly every twenty years or so) there was a surge in the number of cooperative organisations, both in commercial practice and civil society, operating to advance democracy and universal suffrage as a political principle. Friendly Societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization among working people in Anglosphere industrial societies prior to the rise of trade unions and industrial factories. Weinbren reports that by the end of the 19th century, over 80% of British working age men and 90% of Australian working age men were members of one or more Friendly Society.

From the mid-nineteenth century, mutual organisations embraced these ideas in economic enterprises, firstly among tradespeople, and later in cooperative stores, educational institutes, financial institutions and industrial enterprises. The common thread (enacted in different ways, and subject to the constraints of various systems of national law) is the principle that an enterprise or association should be owned and controlled by the people it serves, and share any surpluses on the basis of each member&#x27;s cooperative contribution (as a producer, labourer or consumer) rather than their capacity to invest financial capital.

The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed (1895) by the cooperative movement. It includes the World Council of Credit Unions. The International Cooperative Alliance was founded in London, England on 19 August 1895 during the 1st Cooperative Congress. In attendance were delegates from cooperatives from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, England, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, India, Italy, Switzerland, Serbia, and the US. A second organization formed later in Germany: the International Raiffeisen Union. In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA CLUSA; the abbreviation of the organization retains the initials of its former name, Cooperative League of the USA) serves as the sector&#x27;s oldest national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace.

In 1945 Artturi Ilmari Virtanen received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his invention of the AIV silage. This invention improved milk production and created a method of preserving butter, the AIV salt, which led to increased Finnish butter exports. He had started his career in chemistry in Valio, a cooperative of dairy farmers in which he headed the research department for 50 years and where all his major inventions were first put to practice.

Cooperative banks were first to adopt online banking. Stanford Federal Credit Union was the first financial institution to offer online internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994. In 1996 OP Financial Group, also a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.

By 2004 a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.

The cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of economic democracy. Economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of decision-making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a larger majority of public stakeholders. There are many different approaches to thinking about and building economic democracy. Anarchists are committed to libertarian socialism and have focused on local organization, including locally managed cooperatives, linked through confederations of unions, cooperatives and communities. Marxists, who as socialists have likewise held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive relationships, often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the larger scales of human organization. As they viewed the capitalist class to be politically, militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining an exploitable working class, they fought in the early 20th century to appropriate from the capitalist class the society&#x27;s collective political capacity in the form of the state. Though they regard the state as an unnecessarily oppressive institution, Marxists considered appropriating national and international-scale capitalist institutions and resources (such as the state) to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to solidaristic economies. With the declining influence of the USSR after the 1960s, socialist strategies pluralized, though economic democratizers have not as yet established a fundamental challenge to the hegemony of global neoliberal capitalism.

== Meaning ==

=== Identity ===

==== Co-op principles and values ====

Many cooperatives follow the seven Rochdale Principles:

# Voluntary and open membership
# Democratic member control, with each member having one vote.
# Economic participation by members
# Autonomy and independence
# Education, training and information
# Cooperation among cooperatives
# Concern for community

==== Co-op Marque and domain ====

Since 2002, ICA cooperatives and WOCCU credit unions could be distinguished by use of a .coop domain. In 2014, ICA introduced the Global Cooperative Marque for use by ICAs Cooperative members and by WOCCU&#x27;s Credit Union members so they can be further identified by their coop ethical consumerism label. The marque is used today by thousands of cooperatives in more than a hundred countries.

The .coop domain and Co-operative Marque were designed as a new symbol of the global cooperative movement and its collective identity in the digital age. The Co-operative Marque and domain is reserved just for co-operatives, credit unions and organisations that support co-operatives; is distinguished by its ethical badge that subscribes to the seven ICA Cooperative Principles and Co-op Values. Co-ops can be identified on the Internet through the use of the .coop suffix of internet addresses. Organizations using .coop domain names must adhere to the basic co-op values.

=== Cooperatives as legal entities ===

A cooperative is a legal entity owned and democratically controlled by its members. Members often have a close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products or services, or as its employees. The legal entities have a range of social characteristics. Membership is open, meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non-discriminatory conditions may join. Economic benefits are distributed proportionally to each member&#x27;s level of participation in the cooperative, for instance, by a dividend on sales or purchases, rather than according to capital invested. Cooperatives may be classified as either &quot;worker&quot;, &quot;consumer&quot;, &quot;producer&quot;, &quot;purchasing&quot; or &quot;housing&quot; cooperatives. They are distinguished from other forms of incorporation in that profit-making or economic stability are balanced by the interests of the community.

There are specific forms of incorporation for cooperatives in some countries, e.g. Finland and Australia. Cooperatives may take the form of companies limited by shares or by guarantee, partnerships or unincorporated associations. In the UK they may also use the industrial and provident society structure. In the US, cooperatives are often organized as non-capital stock corporations under state-specific cooperative laws. Cooperatives often share their earnings with the membership as dividends, which are divided among the members according to their participation in the enterprise, such as patronage, instead of according to the value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a joint stock company).

=== Cooperative share capital ===
The cooperative share capital or co-operative share capital (in short &quot;cooperative capital&quot; or &quot;co-operative capital&quot;) is the form of capital that the cooperative accumulates from the paid participation shares of its members. The total amount of participation shares the paid to the cooperative constitutes the cooperative capital. The co-operative share capital is usually non-withdrawable and indivisible to the cooperative members.

== Types of cooperatives ==

The top 300 largest cooperatives were listed in 2007 by the International Co-operative Alliance. 80% were involved in either agriculture, finance, or retail and more than half were in the United States, Italy, or France.

=== Consumers&#x27; cooperative ===
A consumers&#x27; cooperative is a business owned by its customers. Members vote on major decisions and elect the board of directors from among their own number. The first of these was set up in 1844 in the North-West of England by 28 weavers who wanted to sell food at a lower price than the local shops.

==== Retail cooperative ====
Retail cooperatives are retailers, such as grocery stores, owned by their customers. They should not be confused with retailers&#x27; cooperatives, whose members are retailers rather than consumers. In Singapore, Italy, and Finland the company with the largest market share in the grocery store sector is a consumer owned cooperative. In Switzerland both the largest and the second largest retailer are consumer owned cooperatives.

==== Housing cooperative ====
A housing cooperative is a legal mechanism for ownership of housing where residents either own shares (share capital co-op) reflecting their equity in the cooperative&#x27;s real estate or have membership and occupancy rights in a not-for-profit cooperative (non-share capital co-op), and they underwrite their housing through paying subscriptions or rent.

Housing cooperatives come in three basic equity structures
* In market-rate housing cooperatives, members may sell their shares in the cooperative whenever they like for whatever price the market will bear, much like any other residential property. Market-rate co-ops are very common in New York City.
* Limited equity housing cooperatives, which are often used by affordable housing developers, allow members to own some equity in their home, but limit the sale price of their membership share to that which they paid.
* Group equity or zero-equity housing cooperatives do not allow members to own equity in their residences and often have rental agreements well below market rates.

Members of a building cooperative (in Britain known as a self-build housing cooperative) pool resources to build housing, normally using a high proportion of their own labor. When the building is finished, each member is the sole owner of a homestead, and the cooperative may be dissolved.

This collective effort was at the origin of many of Britain&#x27;s building societies, which however, developed into &quot;permanent&quot; mutual savings and loan organisations, a term which persisted in some of their names (such as the former &quot;Leeds Permanent&quot;). Nowadays such self-building may be financed using a step-by-step mortgage which is released in stages as the building is completed. The term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade.

==== Utility cooperative ====
A utility cooperative is a type of consumers&#x27; cooperative that is tasked with the delivery of a public utility such as electricity, water or telecommunications services to its members. Profits are either reinvested into infrastructure or distributed to members in the form of &quot;patronage&quot; or &quot;capital credits&quot;, which are essentially dividends paid on a member&#x27;s investment into the cooperative. In the United States, many cooperatives were formed to provide rural electrical and telephone service as part of the New Deal. &quot;See Rural Utilities Service&quot;.

In the case of electricity, cooperatives are generally either generation and transmission (G&amp;T) co-ops that create and send power via the transmission grid or local distribution co-ops that gather electricity from a variety of sources and send it along to homes and businesses.

In Tanzania, it has been proven that the cooperative method is helpful in water distribution. When the people are involved with their own water, they care more because the quality of their work has a direct effect on the quality of their water.

==== Credit unions, cooperative banking and cooperative insurance ====

Credit unions are cooperative financial institutions owned and controlled by their members. Credit unions provide to its members the same services as banks but are considered not-for-profit organizations and adhere to cooperative principles.

Credit unions originated in mid-19th-century Germany through the efforts of pioneers Franz Herman Schulze&#x27;Delitzsch and Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. The concept of financial cooperatives crossed the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century, when the &quot;caisse populaire&quot; movement was started by Alphonse Desjardins in Quebec, Canada. In 1900, from his home in Lévis, he opened North America&#x27;s first credit union, marking the beginning of the Mouvement Desjardins. Eight years later, Desjardins provided guidance for the first credit union in the United States, where there are now about 7,950 active status federally insured credit unions, with almost 90 million members and more than $679 billion on deposit.

Financial cooperatives hold a significant market share in Europe and Latin America, as well as a few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also have a strong presence in Asia, Australia, and the United States. According to the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU), there were 68,882 financial cooperatives in 109 countries in 2016, serving more than 235 million members, with total assets exceeding 1.7 trillion dollars. The WOCCU&#x27;s data do not include some major financial cooperative networks in Europe, such as Germany, Finland, France, Denmark, and Italy. In many high-income economies, financial cooperatives hold significant market shares of the banking sector.

According to the European Association of Cooperative Banks, the market share of cooperative banks in the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) credit market by the end of 2016 was 37% in Finland, 45% in France, 33% in Germany, 43% in the Netherlands, and 22% in Canada. In Germany, Volksbanken-Raiffeisen banks have a market share of approximately 21% of domestic credit and domestic deposits. In the Netherlands, Rabobank holds 34% of deposits, and in France cooperative banks (Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel and BPCE Group) possess more than 59% of domestic credit and 61% of domestic deposits. In Finland, OP financial group holds 35% and 38% of domestic credit and deposits, respectively, and in Canada, Desjardins holds around 42% of domestic deposits and 22% of domestic credit.

There are many types of cooperative financial institutions with different names across the world, including financial cooperatives (&#x27;cooperativa financiera&#x27; is the Spanish term used in Latin America), cooperative banks, credit unions, and savings and credit cooperatives (&#x27;cooperativa de ahorro y crédito&#x27; in Spanish or &quot; in French-speaking countries).

Cooperative banking networks, which were nationalized in Eastern Europe, continued as cooperative institutions. In Poland, the SKOK (&quot;Spółdzielcze Kasy Oszczędnościowo-Kredytowe&quot;) network grew to serve over 1 million members via 13,000 branches, and was larger than the country&#x27;s largest conventional bank.

In the Scandinavia, there is a clear distinction between mutual savings banks (Sparbank) and true credit unions (Andelsbank).

The oldest cooperative banks in Europe, based on the ideas of Friedrich Raiffeisen, are joined in the &#x27;Urgenossen&#x27;.

====Community co-operative====
A community cooperative is owned and governed by members of a local geographical community. It is established to meet the community&#x27;s needs by providing goods or services that are not available or affordable through traditional market channels. This is distinct from meeting individuals&#x27; needs as individuals.

The aim of a community cooperative is often to create a more equitable and sustainable economy that serves the needs of local residents, rather than generating profits for external shareholders. By working together and pooling resources, members can often achieve economies of scale, negotiate better prices, and develop services that better meet the needs of their community. Community cooperatives can also help to build social capital and foster a sense of community ownership and pride. They have been successful vehicles for rural development in the Gaeltacht in Ireland and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.

=== Worker cooperative ===
A worker cooperative or producer cooperative is a cooperative owned and democratically controlled by its &quot;worker-owners&quot;. In a pure worker cooperative, only the workers own shares of the business on a one person, one vote basis, though hybrid forms exist in which consumers, community members or investors also own some shares (though these shares may or may not have voting power). In practice, control by worker-owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or majority voting rights. A worker cooperative, therefore, has the characteristic that the majority of its workforce owns shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce. Membership is not always compulsory for employees, but generally, only employees can become members either directly (as shareholders) or indirectly through membership of a trust that owns the company.

The impact of political ideology on practice constrains the development of cooperatives in different countries. In India, there is a form of workers&#x27; cooperative which insists on compulsory membership for all employees and compulsory employment for all members. That is the form of the Indian Coffee Houses. This system was advocated by the Indian communist leader A. K. Gopalan. In places like the UK, common ownership (indivisible collective ownership) was popular in the 1970s. Cooperative Societies only became legal in Britain after the passing of Slaney&#x27;s Act in 1852. In 1865 there were 651 registered societies with a total membership of well over 200,000. There are now more than 400 worker cooperatives in the UK, Suma Wholefoods being the largest example with a turnover of £24 million. There also exist some pseudo-cooperatives, such as the John Lewis Partnership, where profits are distributed to the workers, but at the discretion of a senior elected board.

==== Business and employment cooperative ====
&quot;Business and employment cooperatives&quot; (BECs) are a subset of worker cooperatives that represent a new approach to providing support to the creation of new businesses. Like other business creation support schemes, BEC&#x27;s enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with their business idea while benefiting from a secure income. The innovation BECs introduce is that once the businesses are established, the entrepreneurs are not forced to leave and set up independently, but can stay and become full members of the cooperative. The micro-enterprises then combine to form one multi-activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for each other. BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition from inactivity to self-employment, but in a collective framework. They open up new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence needed to set off entirely on their own – or who simply want to carry on an independent economic activity but within a supportive group context.

=== Purchasing cooperative ===
A &quot;purchasing cooperative&quot; is a type of cooperative arrangement, often among businesses, to agree to aggregate demand to get lower prices from selected suppliers. Retailers&#x27; cooperatives are a form of purchasing cooperative.

Major purchasing cooperatives include Best Western, ACE Hardware and CCA Global Partners.

&quot;Agricultural service cooperatives&quot; provide various services to their individual farming members, and to &quot;agricultural production cooperatives&quot;, where production resources such as land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly.

Agricultural supply cooperatives aggregate purchases, storage, and distribution of farm inputs for their members. By taking advantage of volume discounts and using other economies of scale, supply cooperatives bring down members&#x27; costs. Supply cooperatives may provide seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply cooperatives also operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members. Examples include the American cranberry-and-grapefruit cooperative Ocean Spray, collective farms in socialist states and the kibbutzim in Israel.

=== Producer cooperative ===
Producer cooperatives have producers as their members and provide services involved in moving a product from the point of production to the point of consumption. Unlike worker cooperatives, they allow businesses with multiple employees to join. Agricultural cooperatives and fishery cooperatives are such examples.

Agricultural marketing cooperatives operate a series of interconnected activities involving planning production, growing and harvesting, grading, packing, transport, storage, food processing, distribution and sale. Agricultural marketing cooperatives are often formed to promote specific commodities.

Commercially successful agricultural marketing cooperatives include India&#x27;s Amul (dairy products), which is the world&#x27;s largest producer of milk and milk products, Dairy Farmers of America (dairy products) in the United States, and Malaysia&#x27;s FELDA (palm oil).

Producer cooperatives may also be organized by small businesses for pooling their savings and accessing capital, for acquiring supplies and services, or for marketing products and services.

Producer cooperatives among urban artisans were developed in the mid-19th-century in Germany by Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, who also promoted changes to the legal system (the Prussian &quot;Genossenschaftsgesetz&quot; of 1867) that facilitated such cooperatives. At about the same time, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen developed similar cooperatives among rural people.

=== Multi-stakeholder cooperatives ===
Multi-stakeholder cooperatives include representation from different stakeholder groups, such as both consumers and workers.

==== Social cooperative ====
Cooperatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Cooperatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal but not controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means capital ownership is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization. External societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives. In the final year of the 20th century, cooperatives banded together to establish a number of social enterprise agencies that have moved to adopt the multi-stakeholder cooperative model. In the years 1994–2009 the EU and its member nations gradually revised national accounting systems to &quot;make visible&quot; the increasing contribution of social economy organizations.

A particularly successful form of multi-stakeholder cooperative is the Italian &quot;social cooperative&quot;, of which some 11,000 exist. &quot;Type A&quot; social cooperatives bring together providers and beneficiaries of a social service as members. &quot;Type B&quot; social cooperatives bring together permanent workers and previously unemployed people who wish to integrate into the labor market. They are legally defined as follows:
* no more than 80% of profits may be distributed, interest is limited to the bond rate, and dissolution is altruistic (assets may not be distributed)
* the cooperative has legal personality and limited liability
* the objective is the general benefit of the community and the social integration of citizens
* those of type B integrate disadvantaged people into the labour market. The categories of disadvantage they target may include physical and mental disability, drug and alcohol addiction, developmental disorders and problems with the law. They do not include other factors of disadvantage such as unemployment, race, sexual orientation or abuse.
* type A cooperatives provide health, social or educational services
* various categories of stakeholder may become members, including paid employees, beneficiaries, volunteers (up to 50% of members), financial investors and public institutions. In type B cooperatives at least 30% of the members must be from the disadvantaged target groups
* voting is one person one vote

==== SCIC ====
The SCIC – &quot;Société coopérative d&#x27;intérêt collective&quot; (co-operative society of collective interest) is a type of multi-stakeholder co-operative structure introduced in France in 1982. A SCIC must have at least three different categories of members, including users and employees. Other stakeholder groups that may be represented are volunteers, public authorities and other individual or corporate supporters. Voting is on a &#x27;one member, one vote&#x27; basis, though voting in colleges is also provided for under certain circumstances.

SCICs must have a &#x27;general interest&#x27; objective. Public bodies can subscribe for up to 20% of the capital. The status allows an association to convert into a co-operative without having to change its legal form. The relative rigidity of the structure, combined with the government&#x27;s failure to grant tax relief, has limited its take-up.

==== Multi-stakeholding in retailing ====
Multi-stakeholder co-operatives also exist in the retail sector. An example is Färm, a Belgian wholefood retailing cooperative founded in 2015 which favours organic and local produce. It operates 16 shops, of which 11 are in Brussels.

Categories of members:

The cooperative brings together all the participants in the food chain from farm to fork, represented by six different categories of members:
* A Investors: the people providing the financial means necessary to achieve the enterprise&#x27;s ambitions, currently four of the project&#x27;s founders. This category holds 94% of the shares but only exercises 50% of the votes. The board will consider applications from people wishing to invest in excess of €25,000;
* B Managers: the members of Färm&#x27;s management;
* C Workers: members of staff working at Färm, who currently number 36;
* D Sympathisers: clients and people who want to support the project without having a contractual or commercial relationship with it. Anyone can become part of this category by buying shares worth a minimum of €105 (currently 5 shares of €21), and a maximum of €5,000. As of September 2020 the cooperative was not accepting new members;
* E Suppliers and producers: there is no obligation to hold shares in order to collaborate commercially with Färm, but the enterprise finds it nice that the two groups support each other;
* F Supporters: self-employed people who have opened a store under the Färm brand.

Governance

Each member has one vote. The members elect the board of 10 at the annual general meeting. Each category of members has at least one board member to represent them.

An innovative governance provision ensure that no one group of members can dominate the others. In practice board decisions are taken by consensus. In the event of a vote, each director has one vote, and except where the cooperative&#x27;s registered or internal rules provide otherwise, decisions are taken by simple majority of those present or represented. But in the event of a tie, if the votes of a group of voters all belong to the same category, the votes of the other categories prevail.

To ensure that members are committed to the cooperative&#x27;s values, vision and objectives, to guarantee its long-term finance and to limit financial speculation, shares are not transferable for a period of four years.

Members receive a 2% discount on purchases.

==== New generation cooperative ====
New generation cooperatives (NGCs) are an adaptation of traditional cooperative structures to modern, capital intensive industries. They are sometimes described as a hybrid between traditional co-ops and limited liability companies or public benefit corporations. They were first developed in California and spread and flourished in the US Mid-West in the 1990s. They are now common in Canada where they operate primarily in agriculture and food services, where their primary purpose is to add value to primary products. For example, producing ethanol from corn, pasta from durum wheat, or gourmet cheese from goat&#x27;s milk.

=== Other ===

==== Platform cooperative ====
A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a protocol, website or mobile app to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to venture capital-funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them most—workers, users, and other relevant stakeholders. Proponents of platform cooperativism claim that, by ensuring the financial and social value of a platform circulate among these participants, platform cooperatives will bring about a more equitable and fair digitally mediated economy in contrast with the extractive models of corporate intermediaries. Platform cooperatives differ from traditional cooperatives not only due to their use of digital technologies, but also by their contribution to the commons for the purpose of fostering an equitable social and economic landscape.

==== Volunteer cooperative ====
A volunteer cooperative is a cooperative that is run by and for a network of volunteers, for the benefit of a defined membership or the general public, to achieve some goal. Depending on the structure, it may be a collective or mutual organization, which is operated according to the principles of cooperative governance. The most basic form of volunteer-run cooperative is a voluntary association. A lodge or social club may be organized on this basis. A volunteer-run co-op is distinguished from a worker cooperative in that the latter is by definition employee-owned, whereas the volunteer cooperative is typically a non-stock corporation, volunteer-run consumer co-op or service organization, in which workers and beneficiaries jointly participate in management decisions and receive discounts on the basis of sweat equity.

=== Federal or secondary cooperative ===
In some cases, cooperative societies find it advantageous to form cooperative federations in which all of the members are themselves cooperatives. Historically, these have predominantly come in the form of cooperative wholesale societies, and cooperative unions. Cooperative federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the sixth Rochdale Principle, cooperation among cooperatives, with the ICA noting that &quot;Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, regional and international structures.&quot;
==== Cooperative union ====
A second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union, whose objective (according to Gide) is &quot;to develop the spirit of solidarity among societies and... in a word, to exercise the functions of a government whose authority, it is needless to say, is purely moral.&quot; Co-operatives UK and the International Cooperative Alliance are examples of such arrangements.

==== Cooperative political movements ====

In some countries with a strong cooperative sector, such as the UK, cooperatives may find it advantageous to form political groupings to represent their interests. The British Co-operative Party, the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and United Farmers of Alberta are prime examples of such arrangements.

===== UK =====
The British cooperative movement formed the Co-operative Party in the early 20th century to represent members of consumers&#x27; cooperatives in Parliament, which was the first of its kind. The Co-operative Party now has a permanent electoral pact with the Labour Party meaning someone cannot be a member if they support a party other than Labour. Plaid Cymru also run a credit union that is constituted as a co-operative, called the &#x27;Plaid Cymru Credit Union&#x27;. UK cooperatives retain a strong market share in food retail, insurance, banking, funeral services, and the travel industry in many parts of the country, although this is still significantly lower than other business models.

Former leader of the British Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has publicly expressed support for worker cooperatives.

== Working conditions ==
Cooperatives have been traditionally seen as an alternative to the traditional business model, in which a capitalist has the private ownership of the monetary capital and of the means of production and workers have to sell their labor force to the capitalist to earn a salary.

Cooperatives are often said to offer better working conditions than regular firms. This is demonstrated by the fact that cooperatives have a lower turnover rate (rate of workers leaving a firm) compared to regular firms. However, cooperatives do not always show improved working conditions compared to traditional businesses. In fact, the different nature of cooperatives imply that the nature of the working conditions within the cooperatives is also different.

According to Kunle Akingbola, working conditions are &quot;the core elements of work  relationships determined by the social, psychological, and physical factors that influence the workplace and the interaction that employees experience at work&quot; and &quot;typically include the nature of employment, working hours, job characteristics, compensation, work interactions, physical work environment, and written and unwritten work expectations&quot;.

According to Pam a Pam, a cooperative has good working conditions when it has stable contracts, working days consistent with the volume of tasks, and offers a higher salary than the established in the collective agreement of the sector.

=== Wages ===
In 2021, Hanson and Purushinkaya performed a survey on working conditions of cooperatives in the US, in which cooperativists expressed that they were making wages above the minimum for good living conditions. According to the report, they received, on average, 3.52 $/hour more than at their previous job.

Research shows that, in the US, the 77% of the cooperatives have a 1:1 or 2:1 top-to-bottom pay ratio, whereas the average large corporation in the US has a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 303:1. This means that in worker&#x27;s cooperatives there is much more distribution of wealth between the members of the cooperatives, which means that workers that are at the bottom of the organizational pyramid make more money than workers that are at the bottom of the pyramid but that are in conventional firms.

Research also shows that the effect of output price changes on wage variations is positive for both conventional firms (CF) and cooperatives (WC), but larger in WCs than in CFs. This means that, because the distribution of wealth is much greater in WCs, an increase in the benefits of a WC usually is reflected in a proportional increase in the wages, whereas in CF this increase in the wages is much smaller (since the wealth is accumulated by people in the higher position, or is saved for new corporate investments).

However, the fact that the wealth is distributed between the already hired workers has the downside of preventing the cooperatives of hiring more workers, thus having a rate of creation of new jobs that is lower than CF. However, in WC changes on output prices does not translate in more employment, whereas in CF it does (CF create less employment).

Research shows that in times of crisis, employment and wages are more protected in WC than in conventional firms; since the focus of WCs is on protecting employment and because the workers that control the WC do not want to lose their jobs, WC are generally more willing to protect them. This does not happen so much in CF, where the focus is on maintaining the margin of benefits and not employment, which is considered a cost in times of crisis.

Research also shows that the difference of wages between workers hired by the cooperative and workers that are members of the cooperative is small (a worker can work for the cooperative but not be a member of it). Two explanations have been proposed: the first one is that the spirit of cooperativism also extends to hired workers; and the second that sometimes employees are needed for highly skilled jobs, which provides them with strong bargaining power enabling them to defend their employment positions and to compensate for their lack of formal control rights over the firm.

=== Stability of contracts ===
The formation of cooperatives has been used many times to create jobs in economically depressed sites. The communalization of wealth in poor areas often allows them to make the first investment in capital, which allows them to set the cooperative and start having benefits, thus producing an inflow of wealth in the community, which then is redistributed within the members of the cooperatives. This scheme of using cooperatives to create wealth and job opportunities in depressed areas has been famously used, for example, by the Mondragon Corporation, which has provided long term stable jobs for the population of Mondragon (Euskadi) since the mid 50s.

The focus that cooperatives have in protecting jobs is reflected in research. Hanson and Prushinkaya have showed that, in the US, turnover rates are lower in WC than in CF (the turnover rate is the percentage of employees leaving a company within a certain period of time). Jobs at workers&#x27; cooperatives tend to be longer term.

There are several explanations for this: higher compensation and wages for workers; higher job satisfaction; greater adaptability to crisis and economic difficulties, etc.

Research shows that WC show higher adaptability to crisis and economic hardships than CF. During negative demand shocks, WCs contain employment drop and allow a greater downward wage adjustment (the workers themselves decided to lower their own wages to keep the jobs). Another adaptability mechanism is the mutual support between WCs. The case of Cooperativa Mondragón is paradigmatic in this sense: during the 80s, some cooperatives were experiencing financial difficulties, and Mondragon redeployed workers in the struggling co-operatives to ones that were better off. Those who were not redeployed were given income assistance that equaled 80% of their salary. The central control structure of Mondragon allowed for this to happen. This would have been unlikely to happen in unorganized and autonomous co-operatives. This same scheme to save employment prevented Fagor cooperative workers from losing their jobs when Fagor went bankrupt: they were relocated to other cooperatives of the Mondragon group.

=== Workload ===
Overworking due to the need for competitiveness applies to cooperatives as well. Some authors argue that the limitation of working hours in a cooperative should only apply for non-members workers of the coop (hired workers), whereas member workers should be allowed to work as much as they want, allowing the cooperative to collectively take those kind of decisions if they only apply to member workers.

=== Internal democracy ===
According to Pam a Pam, having internal democracy is not limited to having communal spaces of debate and decision making, but also ensuring that the participation in those spaces is not limited by issues of positionality, privilege, or rank.

For example, one of the basic issues with internal democracy is to make sure that every worker has access to all the information of the cooperative, and that is aware of every debate that is happening within the cooperative. It is important to make sure that all important decisions are taken in formal spaces, and avoid using informal spaces in which not everyone might be present to take those decisions.

This issue of having access and voice in the formal spaces for decision making of the cooperative becomes more important the bigger the cooperative gets. Research shows that,  in larger cooperatives, member participation is lower than in smaller cooperatives, and there is a deterioration of internal democracy and working conditions for cooperative members and employees.

Mark Kaswan describes William Thompson&#x27;s theory concerning cooperatives as: &quot;[T]he cooperative structure alters the socio-economic relations of their members, aligning their interests with one another on the basis of a strong principle of equality. It is this alignment of interests on the basis of equality that gives cooperatives their strongly democratic character.&quot; According to Kaswan himself, internal democracy is mostly defined by the type and the size of the cooperative.

Mark Kaswan argues that the type of activity developed by a cooperative is one of the main factors that determines how democratic it is. For example, in worker cooperatives, the workers spend a lot of time in contact with each other, having a high level of both interaction and interdependency. In consumer&#x27;s cooperatives, both the frequency and the intensity of the encounters is lower, thus reducing their democratic participation.

The size of the cooperative is considered to be one of the most important factors for internal democracy. For example, Robert Dahl argues that, as paraphrased by Kaswan, &quot;assembly-style direct democracy can only effectively function in fairly small organisations&quot;. Kaswan states: &quot;Increasing size also increases the complexity of management. [...] This can lead to the problem of &#x27;managerialism&#x27;, or the development of powerful officials whose concerns and interests may be different from those of common members.&quot; If the manager is already a worker-member of the cooperative, the problem might be resolved; but if the manager is hired specifically for managerial purposes, some hierarchies can arise. The contradiction with the issue of size comes with the social impact of the cooperative: greater size usually means greater social impact, but also has a toll on internal democracy.

==== Suggestions to improve internal democracy within a cooperative ====

* Facilitation of all meetings/assemblies is rotated among all members of the coop; training and coaching in facilitation will be provided.
* Permanent and external facilitation (from a specialized process work paradigm external coop) on emotions, conflicts of power, informal hierarchies.
* Any decision made by a coop member can be recalled if 50% of coop members request it.
* Create a space where members can propose improvements and a committee reviews and prioritizes them.
* Revise periodically how the flow of information goes, and see if there are individuals or segments of the coop excluded from this flow, for whatever reason (lack of proper access, unclear messages, technical jargon, excessive workload, etc.), and define collective measures to define what is relevant information (and what is not) and guarantee a full access to it.

=== Legal status of cooperative workers: employees or employed? ===
There is a legal debate on whether to consider being a member of a cooperative as a formal worker or not. For instance, it has been claimed that &quot;the relationship of the worker-member with their cooperative should be considered as distinct from that of conventional wage-based dependent work and self-employed work&quot;. Some authors argue that cooperatives should have their own legal status differentiated from the legal status of a conventional firm, in order for them to get recognition and adapt the law to its unique features.

In Argentina, lawyers have debated whether the relationship between members in the worker cooperative also constitute an employment relationship to which the rules governing pais dependent work are applicable. Some say yes, mainly based on the argument that participation in the management and direction is not incompatible with the condition of subordination and that the individual is subordinated to the majority vote. However, other interpretations say that the link between members and the worker cooperatives is not a labor relation. In many law cases it has been widely adopted that the size of the cooperative is decisive for this question since the personal contribution of members is more important in small cooperatives.

In the US, the Internal Revenue Service determines whether a worker is an independent contractor by considering the degree that the worker:
* Receives less extensive instructions on the work to be done, but not how it should be done;
* Receives training from the business about required procedures and methods;
* Has significant investment in the work;
* Is not reimbursed for some business expenses;
* Has the opportunity to realize a profit or incur a loss;
* Receives benefits from the business;
* Has a written contract that shows the relationship the worker and business intend.

The following factors are generally considered when determining whether an employment relationship exists under the FLSA:
* Is the worker performing work that is an integral part of the business?
* Do the worker&#x27;s managerial skills affect the worker&#x27;s opportunity for both profit and loss?
* What kinds of investment does the worker make in facilities and equipment compared to the employer?
* Does the worker exercise independent business judgement and initiative?
* Is the relationship with the employer indefinite, which suggests an ongoing employee relationship?
* What kind of control does the employer have about how the work is performed, pay amounts, hours worked, and whether the worker is free to also work for others and hire helpers?

=== The problem of labour fraud ===
However, the recognition of cooperatives as different entities than conventional firms sometimes creates a legal void that has been used regularly for labour fraud. For example, in Spain, cooperatives are not subjected to the sectoral collective agreements of each sector. In some cases, businesses take the form of a cooperative to avoid being subjected to collective agreements gained through trade unionism and syndicalism, thus being able to pay lower or have worse labor conditions than the ones stipulated in the collective agreement, while at the same time retaining the same power and salary pyramids.

Many cooperatives are accused of being instruments to be used to lay off workers, to out-source and to exploit workers and small producers. The &quot;cooperativatisation&quot; of both public and private sector activities in some countries has been accompanied by a deterioration of working conditions. This is due both to the perversion of the cooperative form and to weak labour regulations applied to these kinds of work forms.

Usually, the law establishes that a cooperative is required to have a minimum percentage of workers-owners (usually 33%). Cooperatives can hire workers that are not part of the cooperative, but the law usually establishes a maximum amount of time that they can work in the cooperative without being members of it; after that, cooperatives are legally obliged to make those workers part of the cooperative. Some cooperatives commit labour fraud because they either have a smaller percentage of cooperativised workers than mandated by law, or they have people working without becoming members for more time than legally allowed.

In Spain, since the law does not subject cooperatives to the collective agreements or to the social security regulations, the following scheme has been used: if a business wants to pay less than what the sector agreement of its economic sector establishes, the business can create a cooperative, which is not subjected to it, hire all the workers using that cooperative, and then outsource the activity to this cooperative. In this way, instead of having to hire all the workers directly (thus having to pay the Social Security fees and the minimum wage established by the collective agreement), the company only has to use the cooperative as a shell company, and in this way it does not have to pay according to the agreement, and since the workers are hired by the cooperative and not by the company, they are not subject to the either the sector agreement or social security. This is the case, for example, of Spain&#x27;s Servicarne Coop, hired by meat industries such as Coren and Sada, which according to the Audiencia Nacional &quot;does not carry out a cooperative activity&quot; and &quot;has not been established with the purpose of fulfilling the objectives set forth in the Cooperatives Law [...] but only with the aim of obtaining certain benefits that are linked to it, creating a merely formal appearance of a cooperative&quot;, for example, to avoid paying the Social Security fees.

Potential solutions to this fraudulent usage of workers&#x27; cooperatives have been suggested, such as covering the legal void that allows this to happen, creating cooperative federations that ensure the cooperative identity and its regular functioning, etc.

=== Suggestions to improve workers&#x27; conditions within a cooperative ===

* Flexible scheduling.
* Remote work for all staff, with the possibility to do the full working week that way, but also putting some mandatory in-person moments for everyone (conflict resolution, first meetings with new employees, farewell for leaving employees, conflict resolution, strategically and/or politically relevant and/or difficult meetings, celebrations in the coop).
* All time on worker cooperative business is paid.
* Equal pay for all positions (assuming a balanced share of responsibility and job complexity).
* 40 days of vacation (at least).
* Safe and regenerative working place. Applications based on biomimicry and biophilia to promote natural, healthy and diverse environments (different places for calmness, meditation, creativity, stimuli, team bond generation, individual reflection, exercise, connection with nature, water, plants, art, etc.).

== Economic performance ==

=== Job productivity ===
In general terms, research shows that productivity in worker&#x27;s cooperatives is higher than in conventional firms. For example, Fakhfakh et al. (2012) show that in several industries, conventional firms would produce more with their current levels of employment and capital when they adopted the employee-owned firms&#x27; way of organising.

One explanation is that commitment to the cause causes more productivity. The fact that employees can participate in decision-making motivates them to be more involved with the objectives of the cooperative.

Another explanation is that the collective work environment enhances job satisfaction, thus augmenting productivity. Research has shown that collectivists working in simulated collectivist cultures do in fact produce more cooperative behavior than do individualists (i.e., those low in collectivism) in these cultures. Furthermore, it has been argued that collectivists&#x27; ideological commitment to the group members yields higher levels of motivation. Consequently, in addition to making turnover less likely, high collectivism in the WC environment should translate to high performance.

=== Economic stability ===
&quot;Capital and the Debt Trap&quot; reports that &quot;cooperatives tend to have a longer life than other types of enterprise, and thus a higher level of entrepreneurial sustainability&quot;. This has been attributed to how cooperatives share risks and rewards between members, how they harness the ideas of many and how members have a tangible ownership stake in the business. Additionally, &quot;cooperative banks build up counter-cyclical buffers that function well in case of a crisis,&quot; and are less likely to lead members and clients towards a debt trap (p. 216). This is explained by their more democratic governance that reduces perverse incentives and subsequent contributions to economic bubbles.

==== In Europe ====
A 2012 report published by CICOPA (Europe) showed that in France and Spain, worker cooperatives and social cooperatives &quot;have been more resilient than conventional enterprises during the economic crisis&quot;.

A 2013 report by ILO concluded that cooperative banks outperformed their competitors during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7 percent of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2011. Cooperative banks were also over-represented in lending to small and medium-sized businesses in all of the 10 countries included in the report.

A 2017 report published by the Office for National Statistics found that, in the UK, the rate of survival of cooperatives after 5 years was 80 percent compared with only 41 percent for other enterprises. A further study found that after 10 years, 44 percent of cooperatives were still in operation, compared with only 20 percent for other enterprises.

==== In North America ====

===== In the United States of America =====
In a 2007 study by the World Council of Credit Unions, the five-year survival rate of cooperatives in the United States was found to be 90% in comparison to 3–5% for traditional businesses. Credit unions, a type of cooperative bank, had five times lower failure rate than other banks during the financial crisis and more than doubled lending to small businesses between 2008 and 2016, from $30 billion to $60 billion, while lending to small businesses overall during the same period declined by around $100 billion. Public trust in credit unions stands at 60%, compared to 30% for big banks and small businesses are five times less likely to be dissatisfied with a credit union than with a big bank.

===== In Canada =====
A 2010 report by the Ministry of Economic Development, Innovation and Export in Québec found the five-year survival rate and ten-year survival rate of cooperatives in Québec to be 62% and 44% respectively compared to 35% and 20% for conventional firms. Another report by the BC-Alberta Social economy Research Alliance found that the three-year survival rate of cooperatives in Alberta to be 81.5% in comparison to 48% for traditional firms. Another report by the aforementioned Research Alliance found that in British Columbia, the five-year survival rates for cooperatives between 2000 and 2010 to be 66.6% in comparison to conventional businesses that had 43% and 39% in the years 1984 and 1993 respectively.

== Cooperative financing ==
The issue of finance in cooperativism is one of the most importance. Since the failure rates of cooperatives are lower than for conventional firms, the financing schemes used by them are at least as successful as for conventional firms.

One of the success factors lies in the fact that cooperatives use a different arrange of financing schemes

=== Self financing (social base) ===
According to Gianluca Salvatore and Riccardo Bodini, self-financing schemes include the act and the practice of using one&#x27;s own capital to provide funding for an enterprise. The main advantage of self-financing is that it sets the cooperative free from outside influence and debt, but the capacity to expand the coop might be constrained by the lack of capital.

==== Capital by members ====
This is the main form of financing in cooperatives. Usually, workers cooperatives do not only socialize the labor force, but also a part of the economical wealth of each member, that is put in a pool together with the rest of contributions, and that constitutes the capital of the cooperative. Usually, future members have to socialize a certain amount of money to the cooperative before they can become formal members.

The most common way to do it all at once before joining the cooperative, but other financing schemes have been proposed. For example, some cooperatives do not ask for an initial investment, but rather require workers to work for a certain period of time, while retaining a percentage of the wage, until the worker has paid all the requirements and can become a formal member of the cooperative.

Usually, when the worker decides to leave the cooperative, all the money invested will be returned to the worker.

The amount required will vary depending on a lot of factors, such as for example:
* The type of cooperative: if it is a big industrial cooperative, the amount required will probably be higher than for a small services cooperative.
* The current budget of the cooperative: if a cooperative is already economically well established, probably the requirements will be lower. However, if the cooperative is still young and still requires a lot of investments, the initial requirement will be higher.

==== Social loans ====
Occasionally. if the situation requires it, workers of the cooperative can decide to put some more money as an investment, which can later be returned.

=== Cooperative resources ===

==== Gross profits ====
If the cooperative is based on selling products or services, a part of the finance comes from the profits that they get from their activities.

==== Proceeds from assets ====
A cooperative can have different assets from which it can get money without having to sell those assets. For example, if the cooperative has money in the bank, and the bank gives interests, it can generate some more money. Or for example, if the cooperative owns a place and rents it, it can get some more money out of it.

==== Balance sheet assets ====
Assets can also be converted to money. For example, if the cooperative owns shares of another company, they can sell them and turn them into liquidity. Or if the cooperative owns a building, it can sell it. Different types of assets can be converted to liquidity with different levels of ease: for example, selling shares is easier and less time-consuming than selling land, which might take months. Thus, shares are much more easily converted to liquidity than land.

=== Financial grants ===
Financial grants, that are awards typically given by foundations or governments, can also be a source of financiation for cooperatives. They differ from loans in the fact that they under most conditions they do not have to be paid back. Some grants have waiting periods before the grantee can take full ownership of them.

==== Donations ====
They are usually in the form of cash, but can also be in the form of other assets. Donations are specially recommendable if the cooperative has a strong aim for social impact and mutual aid, in which case individual or collective donors might be interested in donating.

==== Crowdfunding ====
Crowdfunding is a way of sourcing money for a project by asking a large number of contributors to individually donate a small amount to it. In return, the backers may receive token rewards that increase in prestige as the size of the donation increases.

A successful example of how to finance a workers cooperative with a crowdfunding is the case of the cooperative of the Collettivo di Fabbrica GKN – Insorgiamo!, who, after occupying and taking back the control of a GKN factory in Florence, they began a crowdfunding campaign to get the initial money needed to create a cooperative that included all the workers that previously worked there. They used that money to make the initial investments to reconvert the factory to manufacture bicycle parts, with a sustainability goal.

==== Foundations and Governments financing ====
Especially for SSE cooperatives, one way to get finance is getting grants from governments or private organizations. The latter are usually related to philanthropy. The difference with other types of grants is that they do not require any previous conditions of challenges that need to be achieved.

==== Challenge grants ====
Challenge grants are funds disbursed by governments, foundations and trusts on completion of challenge requirements. The challenge refers to the actions or results that must be achieved before money is released. The challenge could require a new solution to an existing problem that had been ignored. Additional requirements could be specified, from programme certification to member participation. An example of a challenge grant would be money that is given by a bank if the cooperative increases membership by a certain amount.

=== Lending ===
Lending or debt instruments provide borrowers with funding in exchange for repayment of this funding along with interest, based on predetermined timeframes and interest rate terms. The provision of funding might require guarantees.

==== Concessional/Flexible Loans ====
Concessional and flexible loans include special features such as no or low interest rates, extended repayment schedules, and interest rate modifications during the life of the loan.

==== Crowdlending ====
Crowd lending, also known as peer-to-peer lending, is the practice of lending money through online services that directly match lenders with borrowers. Lenders can earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks, while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates.

==== Social bonds ====
For example, when the bank provides sums of money as donations or financing at competitive conditions in support of initiatives that favour social innovation.

=== Equity investments ===
An equity investment is money that is invested in a company by purchasing shares of that company. Some cooperatives use that as a source of money. In cooperatives equity investments are usually not used, since it is something that is generally believed to go against the principles of cooperativism (the Rochdale Principles themselves limit the equity investments).

==== Direct equity investment ====
Direct capital contribution to a project without the guarantee of repayment; the return on a direct equity investment will depend on the performance of a project/company over the investment period.

==== Financing members ====
Especially at the start of a cooperative, this is used in some cases. It involves a person or a legal entity that, with a financial contribution, favours the establishment of a company and the carrying out of the social activity. Typically, they make part of the initial investment, and once the company is established, they resell all or part of the subscribed shares.

==== Other forms of equity investments ====
Other forms of equity investments used by cooperatives are: equity funds/mutual fund, quasi-equity, equity crowdfunding, social venture capital/impact investing, patient capital, etc.

=== Redistribution of profit ===
Through all these financial means, a cooperative can create a financial profit. The next set of critical financial decisions becomes how to distribute that profit. There are different forms of redistributing the benefit.

==== Capital reinvestment ====
Usually, growing the business is not the main goal of a cooperative (the main goal is to redistribute profit among its members), but sometimes it is necessary to reinvest a part of the profits in the form of new capital, which will allow the cooperative to expand its operations and increase profit in the future. This is especially true during the initial steps of the cooperative, in which its operations have to grow to the point in which they have regained the initial capital investment. The capital reinvestments are decided collectively through the democratic mechanisms that a cooperative has.

==== Patronage refund ====
Patronage refunds are the distribution of profits to the members of the cooperative, who have previously invested money in the form of capital by members and social loans.

==== Dividends ====
The Rochdale principles state that cooperatives should have limited return on equity investments, so its usual for most of the cooperatives to not use equity investments, and, if they do, pay few dividends to the shareholders. The main reason for which they do that is that distributing profits as dividends reduces the potential amount of patronage refunds.

==== Unallocated Retained Earnings, or &quot;cushion fund&quot; ====
Part of the benefits of a cooperative must be saved as a safe fund, which will allow the cooperative to face unexpected situations and crises if they appear.

=== Redistribution of losses ===
In case that a cooperative experiences a loss, there are alternatives to handle them in the most efficient way possible.

==== Make use of the &quot;cushion funds&quot; ====
If a cooperative has had profits at some point, it should have some savings, which it can use in times of economic losses. In this way, they can absorb the losses simply with the money they already had, not having to affect neither wages, employment, or stocks.

==== Allocate the losses to the members ====
This is one of the most common ways to allocate the losses. Making this decision involves the workers deliberating through the stablished democratic mechanisms on how are the losses going to be distributed among membership.

We have already seen that, in times of economical hardships, cooperatives are more willing to reduce their wages rather than reduce employment, whereas conventional firms would rather fire some people and keep the same wages for the rest of them.

== Job satisfaction ==
Castel &quot;et al&quot;. (2011) performed research on job satisfaction in workers cooperatives, and said that job satisfaction is high in workers cooperatives and that social economy values are a source of job satisfaction. Within those types of organizations there are several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that perform in a very characteristic manner, and which are key for job satisfaction.

The intrinsic factors are characteristics of the work itself, and Castel et al. proposes that cooperatives create job satisfaction because they usually involve:
* Reducing the gap between the conception and execution of tasks
* Increasing task significance (making work meaningful)
* Developing workers&#x27; skills
* Seeking to benefit the global environment and society while involving everyone

The extrinsic factors that make work in coops satisfying are:
* A higher level of shared business culture
* Increased confidence in elected management
* Greater attention to working and employment conditions following the increased social responsibility of the company
* Collective decision-making.

However, Castel &quot;et al&quot;. also points out that not all of the characteristics of workers cooperatives increase job satisfaction. In fact, they point out that some characteristics are perjudicial for mental health, such as the perceived increase in work pressure (some workers feel that since they are the owners of their means of production, they are pressured into working more by other colleagues), or the ambiguity of the relationship between other workers (everyone being in the same decision-making position can create conflicts among workers).

Hanson and Prushinkaya (2021) conducted a survey that found similar results: they found that, in general, cooperativists state high job satisfaction, autonomy and voice, and professional development. They also found that the majority of individual respondents described their job security, job satisfaction, work effort, and the economic stability of the company as somewhat or much better than what they experienced in their last job. Also, a majority reported the quality of supervision, feedback, and training was superior in their co-op job. Their research also showed that within co-ops, training and skill-building matters for democratic governance: workers who received cooperative-specific training participated more in workplace decision making.

Another research also shows that worker cooperatives are still beneficial for job satisfaction even if their activity is in no sense related to the social and solidarity economy or has no social purpose at all. According to Hyungsik Eum this is because &quot;in worker cooperatives, worker-members have a sense of ownership of their own jobs and workplaces&quot;.

== Women in cooperatives ==

Since cooperatives are based on values like self-help, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity, they can play a particularly strong role in empowering women, especially in developing countries. Cooperatives allow women who might have been isolated and working individually to band together and create economies of scale as well as increase their own bargaining power in the market. In statements in advance of International Women&#x27;s Day in early 2013, President of the International Cooperative Alliance, Dame Pauline Green, said, &quot;Cooperative businesses have done so much to help women onto the ladder of economic activity. With that comes community respect, political legitimacy and influence.&quot;

However, despite the intended democratic structure of cooperatives and the values and benefits shared by members, due to traditional gender norms on the role of women, and other instilled cultural practices that sidestep attempted legal protections, women and other disadvantaged groups suffer a disproportionately low representation in cooperative membership around the world. Representation of women through &quot;active&quot; membership (showing up to meetings and voting), as well as in leadership and managerial positions is even lower.

Some of the patriarchal behaviors that can be found in cooperatives involve the formal structures and hierarchy that conform} the cooperative:
* Non-open and non-democratic decision-making: democratic spaces are often co-opted by white men, who occupy most of the space, and tend to monopolize the leadership of those democratic spaces. This can result in women having less voice in the cooperative decision making, thus having their needs underrepresented.
* Exclusionary leadership: in some occasions, the management of cooperatives involves electing leaders for specific purposes. The under-representation of women in the democratic spaces can result in them having a smaller chance of being elected as representatives or leaders. Statistics show that women are still underrepresented in responsibility jobs in co-ops.
* Interpersonal relationships: patriarchal behavior can also be found in male colleagues, who often, for example, act in patronizing ways, or have distrust in women&#x27;s capacity to perform certain jobs.
* Lesser wages for non-binary people: non-binary people tend to earn less money than cisgender, even in co-ops.

The strongest manifestations of machismo in cooperatives are: 
* Manifestations of machismo that belittle, offend and detract from security and autonomy. They involve a higher level of degradation.
* Sexual violence: unfortunately, within workers cooperatives sexual violence happens sometimes. It is often hidden by the false supposition that in cooperatives everything is shared and done collectively, which might create an environment that might hide sexual violence. For example, under such a climate of trust and confidence, inappropriate pick-up lines, or sexist joke, could inadvertently pass as normal. In the most extreme cases, sexual aggressions or even rape is wrongly justified under the excuse of having trust and confidence in each other.

== Cooperatives in popular culture ==
, the number of memberships in cooperatives reached one billion, and so the organizational structure and movement has seeped into popular culture.

However, in comparison with the number of co-operatives, they are rarely the subject of literature. Among these, Ken Follett mentions their role in working-class life during World War I in &quot;Fall of Giants&quot; (2010), the first volume of his &quot;Century Trilogy&quot;:
:&quot;Where&#x27;s our mam?&quot;
:&quot;Gone down the Co-op for a tin of jam.&quot;

The local grocery was a co-operative store, sharing profits among its customers. Such shops were popular in South Wales, although no one knew how to pronounce Co-op, variations ranging from &quot;cop&quot; to &quot;quorp&quot;.

Less seriously, in &quot;Murder in the Collective&quot;, Barbara Wilson sets a murder mystery among radical printing collectives in Seattle, while Frances Madeson&#x27;s 2007 comic novel &quot;Cooperative Village&quot; is set in the eponymous housing co-operative in New York.

In the HBO drama television series &quot;The Wire&quot;, several drug dealers create a democratic alliance called the New Day Co-Op with the interests of cutting back on violence and increasing business.

&quot;Co-opoly: The Game of Cooperatives&quot; is a popular board game by TESA Collective played around the world that challenges players to work together to start and run a cooperative and overcome major hurdles.

Cooperatives feature prominently in the Martian economy in Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy and in a speculative future Earth economy in his novel &quot;The Ministry for the Future&quot;.

<doc id="89319" wikidata="Q200401" url="?curid=89319" title="Antigonus I Monophthalmus">
<text>Antigonus I Monophthalmus ( , &quot;Antigonus the One-Eyed&quot;; 382 – 301 BC) was a Macedonian Greek general and successor of Alexander the Great. A prominent military leader in Alexander&#x27;s army, he went on to control large parts of Alexander&#x27;s former empire. He assumed the title of &quot;basileus&quot; (king) in 306 BC and reigned until his death. He was the founder of the Antigonid dynasty, which ruled over Macedonia until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 168 BC.

Antigonus likely served under Philip II of Macedon. He took part in Alexander&#x27;s invasion of Achaemenid Persia and was named satrap of Phrygia. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, he also received Pamphylia and Lycia in accordance with the Partition of Babylon. However, he later incurred the enmity of Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander&#x27;s empire, and was driven from Phrygia. He fled to Greece and formed an alliance with Antipater, later joined by Ptolemy, against Perdiccas. Perdiccas was murdered by his own officers in 320 BC, and Antipater was elected the new regent. During a series of wars between Alexander&#x27;s successors, Antigonus briefly emerged as the most powerful of the Diadochi, ruling over Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia and northern Mesopotamia. Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy and Lysimachus formed a coalition against him, which culminated in his decisive defeat and death at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. His kingdom was divided up by Lysimachus and Seleucus, but his son Demetrius survived and went on to seize control of Macedonia in 294 BC.

==Early career==
Antigonus was born in Macedonia around 382 BC to a nobleman named Philip and his wife, whose name is unknown. While some sources claim that Antigonus &quot;came from peasant or yeoman stock, [and] others that his family was linked to the Macedonian royal house [...] both seem unlikely. [...] [I]n all probability the family was socially prominent and from the Macedonian nobility.&quot; Not much is known about Antigonus&#x27;s early career. He must have been an important figure in the Macedonian Army, as by the time he emerges in historical sources he is noted as being in command of a large part of Alexander&#x27;s army, with responsibility over approximately 7,000 allied Greek infantry. There is an anecdote recorded by Plutarch about an Antigonus who lost an eye at the Siege of Perinthus in 340 BC after &quot;a catapult bolt struck him in the eye&quot;. According to historian Richard Billows, this story &quot;fits Antigonos better than we &quot;know&quot; it to fit anyone else.&quot; Since Antigonus was of the same age as Philip, and a nobleman, he almost certainly served in Philip&#x27;s campaigns, possibly under Philip&#x27;s brothers, (Alexander II and Perdiccas III). His importance at Philip&#x27;s court is shown by the friendships he established with Antipater and Eumenes, two of Philip&#x27;s chief lieutenants.

==Satrap of Phrygia==
In 334 BC, Antigonus served as the commander of the allied Greek infantry, a division of Alexander&#x27;s invasion army of the Persian Empire. Alexander did not trust his Greek infantry and had left them behind when he marched to confront the Western Satraps; therefore Antigonus did not participate in the Battle of the Granicus. When Alexander marched east, he appointed Antigonus as satrap of Phrygia. As Satrap of Phrygia, Antigonus besieged a garrison of mercenaries (1,000 Carians and 100 Greeks) the Persians had left behind and after their surrender he enrolled them in his service allowing him to send his own Greek troops (1,500 mercenaries) to reinforce Alexander for the major battle that was about to be fought at Issus. After the Battle of Issus, he succeeded the Achaemenid satrap of Greater Phrygia, Atizyes, who had died during the battle. Antigonus successfully performed his primary responsibility: to defend Alexander&#x27;s lines of supply and communication during the latter&#x27;s extended campaign against the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Following Alexander&#x27;s victory at Issus, part of the Persian army regrouped in Cappadocia and attempted to sever Alexander&#x27;s lines of supply and communication running through the centre of Asia Minor; however, Antigonus defeated the Persian forces in three separate battles. After defeating the Persian counter-attack, Antigonus focused on conquering the rest of Phrygia and maintaining Alexander&#x27;s lines of communication and supply.

==Alexander&#x27;s death==
At the division of the provinces (the so-called Partition of Babylon) after Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, Antigonus held authority over Phrygia, Lycaonia, Pamphylia, Lycia and western Pisidia confirmed by Perdiccas, the regent of the empire. However, he incurred the enmity of Perdiccas by refusing to assist Eumenes to obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him: Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. Leonnatus had left with his army for Greece, leaving Antigonus alone to deal with Cappadocia, a task he apparently could not or would not complete without additional aid. Perdiccas seems to have viewed this as a direct affront to his authority, and led the royal army to conquer the area. From there, Perdiccas turned west towards Phrygia as a provocation toward Antigonus, who escaped with his son Demetrius to Greece, where he obtained the favor of Antipater, the viceroy of Macedonia (321 BC), and Craterus, one of Alexander&#x27;s top generals. During the First War of the Diadochi, he formed a coalition with Antipater, Craterus and Ptolemy. In 320 BC, Antigonus sailed to and secured Cyprus. The war ended in 320 BC, when Perdiccas was murdered by discontented officers (Seleucus and Antigenes) while unsuccessfully trying to invade Ptolemy&#x27;s satrapy of Egypt.

==Death of Perdiccas==
With the death of Perdiccas in 321 BC, a new attempt at dividing the empire took place at Triparadisus. Antipater was made the new regent of the empire and Antigonus became Strategos of Asia. Antigonus was entrusted with the command of the war against the former members of the Perdiccan faction who had been condemned at Triparadisus.

Antigonus took charge of a part of the Royal Army, and after being reinforced with more reliable troops from Antipater&#x27;s European army, he marched against the ex-Perdiccans Eumenes, Alketas, Domikos, Attalos and Polemon in Asia Minor. Antigonus decided to first deal with Eumenes, who was in Cappadocia. Despite being outnumbered, Antigonus adopted a bold aggressive strategy. He eventually out-generaled and defeated Eumenes at the Battle of Orkynia, forcing him to retire to the fortress of Nora (). Leaving Eumenes under siege, Antigonus now marched on the combined forces of Alcetas, Dokimos, Attalos and Polemon near Cretopolis in Pisidia. Antigonus surprised and defeated his opponents at the Battle of Cretopolis. Antigonus, in two brilliant campaigns in the course of one campaigning season, had annihilated the remnants of the Perdiccan faction with the exception of Eumenes, who was bottled up in Nora.

==Antipater&#x27;s death and the Second Diadochi War==
When Antipater died in 319 BC, he left the regentship to Polyperchon, excluding Cassander, his son. Antigonus and the other dynasts refused to recognize Polyperchon, since it would have undermined their own ambitions. Antigonus entered into negotiations with Eumenes, but Eumenes had already been swayed by Polyperchon, who gave him authority over all other generals within the empire. Affecting his escape from Nora through trickery, Eumenes raised a small army and fled south into Cilicia. Antigonus did not move against Eumenes directly because he was tied up in northwestern Asia Minor campaigning against Cleitus the White who had a large fleet at the Hellespont.

Cleitus was able to defeat Antigonus&#x27;s admiral Nicanor in a sea battle but he was caught off guard the next morning when Antigonus and Nicanor launched a double assault by land and sea on his camp, Cleitus was taken completely by surprise and his entire force was captured or killed (see: Battle of Byzantium). Meanwhile, Eumenes had taken control of Cilicia, Syria and Phoenicia, formed an alliance with Antigenes and Teutamos, the commanders of the Silver Shields and the Hypaspists, and begun to raise a naval force on behalf of Polyperchon. When it was ready he sent the fleet west to reinforce Polyperchon, but off the coast of Cilicia it was met by Antigonus&#x27;s fleet and changed sides. Antigonus had settled his affairs in Asia Minor and marched east into Cilicia, intent on doing battle with Eumenes in Syria. Eumenes somehow had advance knowledge of this and marched out of Phoenicia, through Syria into Mesopotamia, with the idea of gathering support in the upper satrapies.

Eumenes gained the support of Amphimachos, the satrap of Mesopotamia, then marched his army into Northern Babylonia, where he put them into winter quarters. During the winter he negotiated with Seleucus, the satrap of Babylonia, and Peithon, the satrap of Media, seeking their help against Antigonus. Antigonus, finding out Eumenes had left his provinces, took some time securing Cilicia and northern Syria before he marched into Mesopotamia. Unable to sway Seleucus and Pheiton, Eumenes had left his winter quarters early and marched on Susa, a major royal treasury, in Susiana. In Susa, Eumenes sent letters to all the satraps to the north and east of Susiana, ordering them in the kings&#x27; names to join him with all their forces. When the satraps joined Eumenes he had a considerable force, with which he could look forward with some confidence to doing battle against Antigonus. Eumenes then marched southeastwards into Persia, where he picked up additional reinforcements Antigonus, meanwhile, had reached Susa and left Seleucus there to besiege the place, while he himself marched after Eumenes. At the river Kopratas, Eumenes surprised Antigonus during the crossing of the river and killed or captured 4,000 of his men. Antigonus, faced with disaster, decided to abandon the crossing and turned back northward, marching up into Media, threatening the upper satrapies. Eumenes wanted to march westward, and cut Antigonus&#x27;s lines of supply, but the satraps refused to abandon their satrapies and forced Eumenes to stay in the east. In the late summer of 316 BC, Antigonus moved southward again in the hope of bringing Eumenes to battle and ending the war quickly. Eventually the two armies in southern Media and fought in the indecisive Battle of Paraitakene. Antigonus, whose casualties were more numerous, force marched his army to safety the next night. During the winter of 316–315 BC, Antigonus tried to surprise Eumenes in Persia by marching his army across a desert and catching his enemy off guard, unfortunately, he was observed by some locals who reported it to his opponents. A few days later both armies drew up for battle. The Battle of Gabiene was as indecisive as the previous battle at Parataikene. According to Plutarch and Diodorus, Eumenes had won the battle but lost control of his army&#x27;s baggage camp thanks to his ally Peucestas&#x27; duplicity or incompetence. This loss was especially severe for the Silver Shields; the camp contained loot they had accumulated over 30 years of successful warfare, as well as the soldiers&#x27; women and children. Approached by Teutamus, one of their commanders, Antigonus offered to return the baggage train in exchange for custody of Eumenes. The Silver Shields complied, arresting Eumenes and his officers and handing them over. The war was thus at an end. Eumenes was placed under guard while Antigonus held a council to decide his fate. Antigonus, backed up by his son Demetrius, was inclined to spare the prisoner, but the council overruled them and Eumenes was executed.

As a result, Antigonus now was in possession of the empire&#x27;s Asian territories, his authority stretching from the eastern satrapies to Syria and Asia Minor in the west. He seized the treasuries at Susa and entered Babylon. The governor of Babylon, Seleucus, fled to Ptolemy and entered into a league with him, Lysimachus and Cassander.

==The Third Diadochi War==
In 314 BC, Antigonus received envoys from the allied dynasts Ptolemy, Cassander and Lysimachus who demanded he cede Cappadocia and Lycia to Cassander, Hellespontine Phrygia to Lysimachus, Phoenicia and Syria to Ptolemy, and Babylonia to Seleucus, and that he should share the treasure he had accumulated. His only answer was to advise the dynasts to be ready for war. Antigonus sent Aristodemus with a 1,000 talents to the Peloponnesus to raise an army there and also to make an alliance with his old enemy Polyperchon, he and Polyperchon were then to make war on Cassander, he sent an army under his nephew Polemaeus through Cappadocia to the Hellespont to keep Cassander and Lysimachus from invading Asia Minor, he himself invaded Phoenicia which was under Ptolemy&#x27;s control, and besieged Tyre. The siege of Tyre took a year, and after securing Phoenicia he marched his main army into Asia Minor intent on taking out Asander (satrap of Lydia and Caria, and ally to Ptolemy and Cassander), leaving the defence of Syria and Phoenicia to his oldest son Demetrius.

In 312 BC, Antigonus captured Lydia and all of Caria, and drove off Asander, he then sent his nephews Telesphorus and Polemaeus against Cassander in Greece. While Antigonus was engaged in the west, Ptolemy took advantage of the situation and invaded from the south. He met Demetrius&#x27;s forces at the battle of Gaza where Ptolemy won a stunning victory. After the battle, Seleucus, who was fighting for Ptolemy, made his way back to Babylonia, and soon established control over his old satrapy and went on to secure the eastern provinces against Antigonus. Seleucus&#x27;s conquest led to the Babylonian War, during which Seleucus defeated both Demetrius and Antigonus, and secured control over the eastern provinces. After the Babylonian War, which lasted from 311 BC to 309 BC, a peace was concluded between Antigonus and Seleucus leaving them both to consolidate their power in their respective realms (Antigonus in the West and Seleucus in the East).

In the West, Antigonus had worn down his enemies and forced a peace upon them. By this peace he had attained the zenith of his power. Antigonus&#x27;s empire and alliance system now comprised Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia and northern Mesopotamia.

==The Fourth Diadochi War==

The peace agreement was soon violated by Ptolemy and Cassander based on the pretext that Antigonus had placed garrisons in some of the free Greek cities. Ptolemy and Cassander renewed hostilities against Antigonus. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander.

In 306 BC, Philip, Antigonus&#x27;s youngest son, died a premature death, aged about 26–28. This was a severe blow to Antigonus, who not only lost a son, but also a general who might have been of the greatest value to him in the campaigns to come.

After defeating Ptolemy at the naval Battle of Salamis in 306 BC, Demetrius conquered Cyprus. Following that victory Antigonus assumed the title of king and bestowed the same royal rank upon his son. This was effectively a declaration by Antigonus that he now was independent from the empire. The other dynasts, Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus and Seleucus, soon followed Antigonus&#x27;s lead and declared themselves kings.

Antigonus now prepared a large army and a formidable fleet, the command of which he gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure as he was unable to penetrate Ptolemy&#x27;s defences and was obliged to retire, although he inflicted heavy losses on Ptolemy.

In 305 BC, Demetrius attempted the reduction of Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt. The siege of Rhodes lasted a year and ended in 304 BC when Demetrius, meeting with obstinate resistance, was obliged to make a peace treaty upon the terms that the Rhodians would build ships for Antigonus and aid him against any enemy except for Ptolemy. The Rhodians dubbed Ptolemy (&quot;savior&quot;) for his aid during the lengthy siege.

The most powerful dynasts of the empire, now kings in their own right: Cassander, Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus, responded to Antigonus&#x27;s successes by allying with each other, often through marriage. Antigonus soon found himself at war with all four, largely because his territory shared borders with each of them. In 304–303, Demetrius had Cassander in a difficult position, having gained the support of the Greeks and defeating Cassander repeatedly. Antigonus demanded from Cassander the unconditional submission of Macedonia. Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Ptolemy responded by joining forces and attacking him. Lysimachus and Cassander&#x27;s general Prepelaos invaded Asia Minor from Thrace, crossing the Hellespont. Lysimachus had soon secured most of the Ionian cities. Meanwhile, Seleucus was marching through Mesopotamia and Cappadocia. Antigonus was obliged to recall Demetrius from Greece, where his son had recently had an indecisive encounter with Cassander in Thessaly. Now Antigonus and Demetrius moved against Lysimachus and Prepelaos.

However, the united forces of Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Prepelaos defeated the army of Antigonus and Demetrius at the decisive Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Antigonus died during the battle in his eighty-first year after being struck by a javelin. Prior to Ipsus, he had never lost a battle. With his death, any plans for reuniting Alexander&#x27;s empire came to an end. Antigonus&#x27;s kingdom was divided up, with most of his territories ending up in the hands of the new kingdoms ruled by Lysimachus and Seleucus. The victors largely followed Antigonus&#x27;s precedent and had themselves named as kings, but they did not claim power over the erstwhile empire of Alexander nor over each other. Instead, these kings established a troubled (and in the end failed) &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with each other, and accepted their kingdoms as separate realms.

Antigonus&#x27;s surviving son Demetrius took control of Macedonia in 294 BC. Antigonus&#x27;s descendants held this possession, off and on, until it was conquered by the Roman Republic after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC.

==Family==
Antigonus&#x27;s father was a nobleman named Philip. His mother&#x27;s name is unknown. Antigonus had an older brother named Demetrius, a younger brother named Polemaeus, father of Polemaeus. His nephew Telesphorus may have been the son of a third brother. He also had a younger half-brother, Marsyas, from his mother&#x27;s second marriage to Periander of Pella.

Antigonus married to Stratonice, his older brother&#x27;s widow and had two sons: Demetrius I Poliorcetes and Philip.

==Physical appearance==

Antigonus was an exceptionally large man. His son Demetrius is described as being of &quot;heroic stature&quot;, meaning no doubt he was a large man, but Antigonus was even taller. Besides this huge physique, he was made even more formidable in appearance because he was missing an eye, having lost it in battle (possibly at the Siege of Perinthus).

==Monophthalmus in historical fiction==
Mary Renault, in her novel &quot;Funeral Games&quot;, translates Antigonus&#x27;s sobriquet into English as &quot;One Eye&quot;.

In the 2004 film &quot;Alexander,&quot; directed by Oliver Stone, Antigonus is played by Ian Beattie.

Antigonus appears (under the Greek form of his name, Antigonos) in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s historical novels &quot;An Elephant for Aristotle&quot; and &quot;The Bronze God of Rhodes&quot;, set approximately twenty years apart.

Antigonus figures as the main antagonist in Christian Cameron&#x27;s historical novel &quot;A Force of Kings&quot;.
Antigonus appears in the earlier chapters of Alfred Duggan&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Elephants and Castles&quot; (U.S. title: &quot;Besieger of Cities&quot;), based on the life of his son Demetrius.

Antigonous is a supporting antagonist in the Eric Flint alternate history novel &quot;The Alexander Inheritance,&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Macedonian Hazard.&quot;

<doc id="89320" wikidata="Q1968981" url="?curid=89320" title="Rug making">
<text>A rug is a piece of cloth, similar to a carpet, but it does not span the width of a room and is not attached to the floor. It is generally used as a floor covering, or as a decorative feature.

==Braided==
Braided rugs are made by using three or more strips of fabric, usually wool, folding the raw edges to the middle and braiding them together. For an oval rug the centre braid should be one inch longer than the width-length in feet. example 2&#x27; x 4&#x27; rug centre strip would be 2&#x27;2&quot; long. The centre braid is laced together and new strips are sewn on to make the braid longer as lacing continues.

==Hooking==

Traditional rug hooking is a craft in which rugs are made by pulling loops of yarn or fabric through a stiff woven base such as burlap, linen, rug warp or monks cloth. The loops are pulled through the backing material by using a latch hook mounted in a handle (usually wood) for leverage.

==Rag rugs==
Rag rugs were commonly made in households up to the middle of the 20th century by using odd scraps of fabric on a background of old sacking. Rag rugs became widespread during the Industrial Revolution to the nineteenth century, but by the 1920s the craft was dying out except in areas of poverty or where tradition had a stronger hold. The necessity for thrift during World War II brought a brief revival, but it did not last long.

===Prodded===
Proddy rugs are made, as the name implies, by prodding or poking strips of fabric through hessian or linen from the back side. Rag rugs made this way have many names, such as clippies, stobbies, clippers and peggies. In Northumberland they are called proggy mats, and in Scotland they are called mats. They were often made for more utilitarian use such as by the back door, their pile hiding dirt well.

The Museum of English Rural Life has a collection of rug-making tools and thrift rugs.

==Woven==

These are both handmade and machine-made (see carpet). Woven rugs include both flat rugs (for example kilims) and pile rugs. The more tightly a rug is woven or knotted, the more detailed a design can be. &quot;It is generally believed that the density of knots, the age, the material, and the rarity of the design or knots determines the value of a carpet. ...&quot;

<text>Perseus (; – 166 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon from 179 until 168BC. He is widely regarded as the last king of Macedonia and the last ruler from the Antigonid Dynasty, as his defeat by Rome at the Battle of Pydna during the Third Macedonian War effectively ended Macedonia as an independent political entity.

==Early life==
Perseus was the son of king Philip V of Macedon and a concubine, probably Polycratia of Argos. His father spent most of his reign attempting to maintain Macedonian hegemony over Greece against heavy Greek resistance and, in his later reign, against an expansionist Roman Republic. Philip V failed in this endeavor: following defeat in the Second Macedonian War he was compelled to accept Roman power in Greece, and later helped Rome in the War against Nabis (195 BC) and the Aetolian War (191–189 BC). Perseus is recorded as having commanded Macedonian troops in both the Second Macedonian War and the Aetolian War. Being a son of a concubine, Perseus feared that the throne might pass on to his legitimate younger brother Demetrius, who had been sent as a hostage to Rome following the Second Macedonian War and now led a pro-Roman faction within the Macedonian court. In 180 BC Perseus forged a letter supposedly from the Roman general Titus Quinctius Flamininus, which suggested that Demetrius was planning to overthrow Philip V. This successfully convinced Philip V to execute Demetrius. Philip died the next year and was succeeded by Perseus on 22 June 168 BC.

==Reign==

In 172 BC, Eumenes II of Pergamon, fearing the expansion of Macedonian power in the Eastern Mediterranean, gave a speech to the Roman Senate in which he accused Perseus of threatening the stability of the Greek world. Soon Rome and Perseus went to war in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Although Perseus had some initial success, the war ended with the King&#x27;s surrender to the Roman general Lucius Aemilius Paullus after his decisive defeat at the Battle of Pydna, and his eventual imprisonment in Rome with his half-brother Philippus and son Alexander. Blaise Pascal mentions in his Pensées (Lafuma 15) that Perseus was blamed for not committing suicide, supposedly after his defeat at Pydna. The Antigonid kingdom was dissolved, and replaced with four republics. Perseus was led as a captive in the triumph of Paullus, then thrown in prison, where – according to Plutarch – after two years, the Romans decided to kill him, and had him kept from sleeping to the point that he died from exhaustion in 166 BC. Livy, however, writes that he was shown clemency, and kept in good conditions at Alba Fucens for the rest of his life.

In 178 BC, he had married Laodice V, the daughter of Seleucus IV from Syria. One son of Perseus and Laodice, Alexander, was still a child when Perseus was defeated by the Romans, and after the triumph of Aemilius Paullus in 167 BC, was kept in custody at Alba Fucens, together with his father. He became a skillful metalworker, learned the Latin language, and became a public notary.

== Legacy ==
In 149 BC, Andriscus, claiming to be Perseus&#x27; son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans. Over the course of about a year, he made an effort to challenge Roman rule, but was defeated by the Romans in 148 BC, thereby ending the reign of the last Macedonian king. In 146 BC, the four republics were dissolved, and Macedon officially became the Roman province of Macedonia.

<doc id="89326" wikidata="Q51491" url="?curid=89326" title="Michael Curtiz">
<text>Michael Curtiz (; born Manó Kaminer; from 1905 Mihály Kertész; ; December 24, 1886 April 10, 1962) was a Hungarian-American film director, recognized as one of the most prolific directors in history. He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during
Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent.

Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz&#x27;s direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times, and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; and once as Best Director for &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

Curtiz was among those who introduced to Hollywood a visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile, and could handle any film genre: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, horror, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the &quot;human and fundamental problems of real people&quot; were the basis of all good drama.

The death of 25 horses in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; under Curtiz&#x27;s direction resulted in a near-violent confrontation between Curtiz and star Errol Flynn, which led in turn to the U.S. Congress and the ASPCA enacting legislation and policy to prevent cruelty to animals on the sets of movies.

Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler, with films such as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). He directed many other dramas which are considered classics: &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945). He directed leading musicals, including &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943), and &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), and he made comedies, with &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947) and &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1955).

== Early life ==
Curtiz was born Manó Kaminer to a Jewish family in Budapest in 1886, where his father was a carpenter and his mother an opera singer. In 1905, he Magyarised his name to Mihály Kertész. Curtiz had a lower middle class upbringing. He recalled during an interview that his family&#x27;s home was a cramped apartment, where he had to share a small room with his two brothers and a sister. &quot;Many times, we are hungry,&quot; he added.

After graduating from high school, he studied at Markoszy University, followed by the Royal Academy of Theater and Art, in Budapest, before beginning his career.

== Career in Europe ==
=== Actor ===
Curtiz became attracted to the theater when he was a child in Hungary. He built a little theatre in the cellar of his family home when he was 8 years old, where he and five of his friends re-enacted plays. They set up the stage, with scenery and props, and Curtiz directed them.

After he graduated from college at age 19, he took a job as an actor with a travelling theatre company, where he began working as one their travelling players. From that job, he became a pantomimist with a circus for a while, but then returned to join another group of travelling players for a few more years. They played Ibsen and Shakespeare in various languages, depending on what country they were in. They performed throughout Europe, including France, Hungary, Italy, and Germany, and he eventually learned five languages. He had various responsibilities:
=== Director ===
He worked as Mihály Kertész at the National Hungarian Theater in 1912. and was a member of the Hungarian fencing team at the Olympic Games in Stockholm. Kertész directed Hungary&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot; (&quot;Ma és holnap&quot;, 1912), in which he also had a leading role. He followed that with another film, &quot; The Last Bohemian&quot; (&quot;Az utolsó bohém&quot;, also 1912).

Curtiz began living in various cities in Europe to work on silent films in 1913. He first went to study at Nordisk studio in Denmark, which led to work as an actor and assistant director to August Blom on Denmark&#x27;s first multireel feature film, &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1913).
After World War I began in 1914, he returned to Hungary, where he served in the army for a year, before he was wounded fighting on the Russian front. Curtiz wrote of that period:
He was assigned to make fund-raising documentaries for the Red Cross in Hungary. In 1917, he was made director of production at Phoenix Films, the leading studio in Budapest, where he remained until he left Hungary. However, none of the films he directed there survive intact, and most are completely lost.

By 1918, he had become one of Hungary&#x27;s most important directors, having by then directed about 45 films. However, following the end of the war, in 1919, the new communist government nationalized the film industry, so he decided to return to Vienna to direct films there.

Curtiz briefly worked at UFA GmbH, a German film company, where he learned to direct large groups of costumed extras, along with using complicated plots, rapid pacing, and romantic themes. His career truly started due to his work for Count Alexander Kolowrat (known as Sascha), with whom he made at least 21 films for the count&#x27;s film studio, Sascha Films. Curtiz later wrote that at Sascha, he &quot;learned the basic laws of film art, which, in those days, had progressed further in Vienna than anywhere else.&quot;

Among the films he directed were Biblical epics such as &quot;Sodom und Gomorrha&quot; (1922) and &quot;Die Sklavenkönigin&quot; (1924) (titled &quot;Moon of Israel&quot; in the U.S.). He also made &quot;Red Heels&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Golden Butterfly&quot; (1926), and once directed 14-year-old Greta Garbo in Sweden. During this period, he tended to specialize in directing two kinds of films, either sophisticated light comedies or historical spectaculars. He launched the career of Lucy Doraine, who went on to become an international star, along with that of Lili Damita, who later married Errol Flynn.

&quot;The Moon of Israel&quot; (1924) was a spectacle of the enslavement of the children of Israel and their miraculous deliverance by way of the Red Sea. Shot in Vienna with a cast of 5,000, it had for its theme the love story of an Israelite maiden and an Egyptian prince. Paramount Pictures in the U.S. bought the rights to the film to compete with Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. However, &quot;The Moon of Israel&quot; caught the attention of Jack and Harry Warner, and Harry went to Europe in 1926 just to meet Curtiz and watch him work as director.

The Warners were impressed that Curtiz had developed a unique visual style which was strongly influenced by German Expressionism, with high crane shots and unusual camera angles. The film also showed that Curtiz was fond of including romantic melodrama &quot;against events of vast historical importance, for driving his characters to crises and forcing them to make moral decisions,&quot; according to Rosenzweig. He offered Curtiz a contract to be a director at his new film studio in Hollywood, Warner Bros., where he would direct a similar epic that had been planned, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1928). By the time Curtiz accepted Warner&#x27;s offer, he was already a prolific director, having made 64 films in countries including Hungary, Austria, and Denmark.

== Career in the US ==
=== 1920s ===
Curtiz arrived in the United States in the summer of 1926, and began directing at Warner Bros. under the anglicised name Michael Curtiz. During what became a 28-year period at Warner Bros., he directed 86 films, including his best work.

Although he was an experienced filmmaker, now aged 38, Warners assigned him to direct a number of average-quality films to break him in, the first being &quot;The Third Degree&quot; (1926). Curtiz&#x27;s unique camerawork technique was used throughout, visible in dramatic camera angles, in a style which one critic assumed other directors would likely envy.
Learning English quickly was an immediate hurdle, however, since he had no free time. When Jack Warner gave him the film to direct, Curtiz recalls, &quot;I could not speak one word of English.&quot; It was a romantic story about jail life and gangsters in Chicago, a place he had never been, about American underworld figures he had never met.

To gain some direct experience about the subject, Curtiz persuaded the Los Angeles sheriff to let him spend a week in jail. &quot;When I came out, I knew what I needed for the picture.&quot;

Curtiz firmly believed that investigating the background of every story should be done first and done thoroughly before starting a film. He said that whenever someone asked him how he, a foreigner, could make American films, he told them, &quot;human beings are the same all over the world. Human emotions are international.&quot; He treated his first films in the U.S. as learning experiences:


Although the language barrier made communicating with the casts and crews a hardship, he continued to invest time in preparation. Before he directed his first Western, for example, he spent three weeks reading about the histories of Texas and the lives of its important men. He found it necessary to continue such intensive studying of American culture and habits in preparation for most other film genres. But he was quite satisfied being in Hollywood:

&quot;The Third Degree&quot; (1926), available at the Library of Congress, made good use of Curtiz&#x27;s experience in using moving cameras to create expressionistic scenes, such as a sequence shot from the perspective of a bullet in motion. The film was the first of eight Curtiz films to have Dolores Costello as its star.
Warner Bros. had Curtiz direct three other mediocre stories to be sure he could take on larger projects, during which time he was able to familiarize himself with their methods and work with the technicians, including cameramen, whom he would use in subsequent productions. As biographer James C. Robertson explains, &quot;In each case, Curtiz strove valiantly, but unsuccessfully to revitalize unconvincing scripts through spectacular camera work and strong central performances, the most noteworthy features of all those films.&quot;
On a visit to Hollywood in 1927, Ilya Tolstoy, Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s son, who had been a friend of Curtiz in Europe, wanted him to direct several films based on his father&#x27;s novels. He chose Curtiz because he already knew the locale and its people. During this period, Warner Bros. began experimenting with talking films. They assigned two part-talking pictures for Curtiz to direct: &quot;Tenderloin&quot; (1928) and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1928), both of which also starred Costello.

&quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; included two parallel stories, one recounting the biblical flood, and the other a World War I-era romance. It was the first epic film attempted by Warner Bros., and in handing production over to Curtiz, they were hoping to assure its success. The climactic flood sequence was considered &quot;spectacular&quot; at the time, observed historian Richard Schickel, while biographer James C. Robertson said it was &quot;one of the most spectacular incidents in film history.&quot; Its cast was made up of over 10,000 extras. However, the reissue of the film in 1957 cut an hour off the original time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. The story was an adaptation written by Bess Meredyth, who married Curtiz a few years later.

The critical success of these films by Curtiz contributed to Warner Bros&#x27; becoming the fastest-growing studio in Hollywood.

=== 1930s ===
In 1930, Curtiz directed &quot;Mammy&quot; (1930), Al Jolson&#x27;s fourth film after being in Hollywood&#x27;s first true talking picture, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). During the 1930s, Curtiz directed at least four films each year.

Although unusual projects for Warner Bros., Curtiz directed two horror films for the studio, &quot;Doctor X&quot; (1932) and &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; (1933), both in early Technicolor, with numerous atmospheric scenes filmed on the studio&#x27;s back lot.

Another breakthrough film was &quot;20,000 Years in Sing Sing&quot; (1932), starring then little-known actors Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis in one of their earliest films. MGM head Louis B. Mayer saw the film and was impressed enough by Tracy&#x27;s acting that he hired him on to MGM&#x27;s roster of stars.

Curtiz&#x27;s American career did not really take off until 1935. In the early 1930s, Warner Bros. was struggling to compete with the larger MGM, which was releasing costume dramas such as &quot;Queen Christina&quot; (1933) with Greta Garbo, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934) with Wallace Beery, and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1934). Warner Bros. decided to take a chance and produce their own costume drama.

Until then, it was a genre in which Warners&#x27; had assumed they could never succeed, owing to its higher production budgets during the years of the Great Depression. However, in March 1935, Warners announced it would produce &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), a swashbuckler action drama based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini, and directed by Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known Olivia de Havilland.
The film was a major success with positive critical reviews. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and though not nominated, Curtiz received the second-highest number of votes for Best Director, solely from write-in votes. It also made stars of both Flynn and de Havilland, and it elevated Curtiz to being the studio&#x27;s leading director.

Curtiz continued the successful genre of adventure films starring Flynn (often with de Havilland) that included &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), a depiction of the British Light Brigade during the Crimean War. The film, another Oscar winner, was a greater success at the box-office than &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. It was followed by &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938, co-directed with William Keighley whom Curtiz replaced), the most profitable film that year, also winning three Academy Awards and being nominated for Best Picture. It is in Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; list of Top 100 Movies.

That being their third Curtiz film together, Flynn and de Havilland continued to star in other hugely successful films under his direction, including &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939), also co-starring Bette Davis. Davis starred in a Curtiz film in most years during the 1930s.
Curtiz elicited some of the finest work from Edward G. Robinson in &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; (1937), where Robinson played a tough and sardonic, but ultimately soft-hearted, boxing manager. The picture co-starred Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart.

Because of Curtiz&#x27;s high film productivity, Warner Bros. created a special unit for his pictures, which then allowed him to manage two film crews. One worked with him during actual filming, while the other prepared everything for the next picture.

John Garfield was among Curtiz&#x27;s discoveries.
Curtiz discovered Garfield, a stage actor, by accident, when he came across a discarded screen test he gave, and thought he was very good. Garfield had assumed he failed the screen test and was already heading back to New York in disgust. Curtiz then went to Kansas City to intercept the train, where he pulled Garfield off and brought him back to Hollywood. Garfield made his debut in &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938), followed by a co-starring role in its sequel, &quot;Four Wives&quot; (1939). Garfield also later co-starred in Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941).

In &quot;Four Daughters&quot;, Garfield co-starred with Claude Rains, who would star in 10 Curtiz movies over his career, with six of those during the 1930s. Garfield and Rains &quot;were brilliant together in this unjustly neglected Curtiz classic,&quot; says biographer Patrick J. McGrath. Garfield considered it his &quot;obscure masterpiece.&quot; Reviews praised his role: &quot;Perhaps the greatest single occurrence having to do with &quot;Four Daughters&quot; on reading the critics appears to be the debut of John Garfield, a brilliant young actor recruited from the Broadway stage.&quot; Similar approval came from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called Garfield&#x27;s acting &quot;bitterly brilliant ... one of the best pictures of anybody&#x27;s career.&quot; Garfield and Rains co-starred the following year in Curtiz&#x27; &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot; (1939).

When James Cagney starred in Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), he was nominated for an Oscar for the first time. The New York Film Critics Circle voted him as best actor for his portrayal in the film, where he played the part of a hoodlum who redeems himself. Curtiz was also again nominated, solidifying further his status as the studio&#x27;s most important director. Curtiz was nominated for the 1938 Oscar for Best Director for both &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; and &quot;Four Daughters&quot; losing to Frank Capra for &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;. Curtiz, however, had split his votes between two films and had actually the greater number of aggregate Academy votes.

The following year, Curtiz directed a short subject, &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; (1939), starring Claude Rains, in a biopic which dramatizes the Jewish contribution to America&#x27;s independence. Curtiz won an Academy Award in the category of Best Short Subject (Two-reel), for this film.

Three Westerns directed by Curtiz also starring Flynn were &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940) co-starring future US president Ronald Reagan, and &quot;Virginia City&quot; (1940).

=== 1940s ===
During the 1940s Curtiz continued to release more critically acclaimed films, including &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1940), &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941), &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), and &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947).

One of the biggest hits of 1940 was &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;, starring Errol Flynn in the role of an adventurer in the mold of Sir Francis Drake. Flora Robson played Queen Elizabeth I, and Claude Rains acted as the Spanish ambassador, whose job it was to mislead the Queen, who rightly suspected the Spanish Armada was about to attempt to invade England. Some critics felt the story was equivalent to actual events then taking place in Europe, describing it as a &quot;thinly veiled diatribe against American isolationism on World War II&#x27;s brink.&quot; Film columnist Boyd Martin noticed the similarities:


&quot;Dive Bomber&quot; (1941) was released a few months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Curtiz shot every foot of &quot;Dive Bomber&quot; with Navy assistance and under strict Navy scrutiny. Filming at the active naval base in San Diego required great care, especially for aerial sequences. To create realistic shots, he mounted cameras on the Navy&#x27;s planes to achieve &quot;amazing point-of-view shots,&quot; taking viewers inside the cockpit during flight. He also mounted cameras underneath the wings of planes to dramatize take-offs from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, an aircraft carrier launched a few years earlier.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a good review:
The film was well received by the public, becoming the sixth-most popular film that year. No other pre-Pearl Harbor picture matched the quality of its flying scenes. Film columnist Louella Parsons wrote, &quot;&quot;Dive Bomber&quot; again makes us glad we are Americans protected by a Navy as competent as ours.&quot;

Edward G. Robinson starred in &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941), his second film directed by Curtiz. He portrayed the rampaging, dictatorial captain of a ship in an adaptation of one of Jack London&#x27;s best known novels. Robinson said the character he portrayed &quot;was a Nazi in everything but name,&quot; which, Robinson observed, was relevant to the state of the world at that time. John Garfield and Ida Lupino were cast as the young lovers who attempt to escape his tyranny. Some reviews described the film as one of Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;hidden gems ... one of Curtiz&#x27;s most complex works.&quot; Robinson was impressed by Garfield&#x27;s intense personality, which he felt may have contributed to Garfield&#x27;s death at age 39:


Curtiz directed another Air Force film, &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot; (1942), about the Royal Canadian Air Force. It starred James Cagney and Brenda Marshall. According to Hal B. Wallis, its producer, it became Warner Bros.&#x27; most extensive and difficult production, and everything had to be relocated to Canada. Like &quot;Dive Bomber&quot;, the vivid aerial scenes filmed in Technicolor were another feature that garnered critical attention, and the film was nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Color Cinematography.

Shortly after &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot; was completed, but released after his next picture, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Curtiz directed the musical biopic, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), a film about singer, dancer, and composer George M. Cohan. It starred James Cagney in a role totally opposite from the one he had played four years earlier in Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;. Where the earlier film became a career high point for Cagney&#x27;s portrayals of a gangster, a role he played in many earlier films, in this film, an overtly patriotic musical, Cagney demonstrates his considerable dancing and singing talents. It was Cagney&#x27;s favorite career role.

Cagney&#x27;s bravura performance earned him his only Academy Award as Best Actor. For Warner Bros., it became their biggest box-office success in the company&#x27;s history up to that time, nominated for nine Academy Awards and winning four. The success of the film also became a high point in Curtiz&#x27;s career, with his nomination as Best Director. The film has been added to annals of Hollywood as a cinematic classic, preserved in the United States National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Curtiz directed &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), a World War II-era romantic drama described by Roger Ebert in 1996 as one of the most popular films ever made. Its stars were Humphrey Bogart, playing an expatriate living in Morocco, and Ingrid Bergman as a woman who was trying to escape the Nazis. The supporting cast features Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. The picture received eight Academy Award nominations and won three, including one for Curtiz as Best Director. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2012 described &quot;Casablanca&quot; as &quot;the best movie ever made&quot;.

Another patriotic Curtiz film was &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943), a musical adapted from the stage play with a score by Irving Berlin. As America was engaged in World War II, the film boosted the morale of soldiers and the public. Kate Smith&#x27;s rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; was one of the highlights of the film&#x27;s nineteen songs.
 As a result of the film&#x27;s numerous popular and generic elements, such as ground and aerial combat, recruitment, training, and marching as well as comedy, romance, song, and dance, it was the most financially successful war-themed film of any kind made during World War II.

During this period, Curtiz also directed the World War II propaganda film &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943), a film which was commissioned at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in support of the U.S. and British ally, the Soviet Union, at that time holding down 80% of all German forces as they repelled the Nazi invasion of Russia. The film was mostly well received by critics and was a success at the box office, but the film soon proved to be controversial after it stirred up strong anti-Communist attacks. Curtiz took the criticism personally and vowed never again to direct an overtly political film, a promise which he kept.
&quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) was based on the novel by James M. Cain. Its star, Joan Crawford, gave one of the strongest performances in her career, playing a mother and successful businesswoman who sacrifices everything for her spoiled daughter, played by Ann Blyth.

At the time Crawford accepted the part from Warner Bros., her 18-year career at MGM had been in decline. She had been one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prominent and highest-paid stars but her films began losing money, and by the end of the 1930s, she was labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;. Rather than remain at MGM and see newer, younger talent draw most of the studio&#x27;s attention with better roles, she left MGM and signed a contract with Warner Bros. at a reduced salary.

Curtiz originally wanted Barbara Stanwyck for the role. However, Crawford, who by then had not been in a film for two years, did her best to get the part. Rare for a major star, she was even willing to audition for Curtiz. She was already aware that &quot;Mr. Mike Curtiz hated me ... I don&#x27;t want those big broad shoulders,&quot; he said. During her reading of an emotional scene as he watched, she saw him become so overwhelmed by her delivery that he cried, and he then said, &quot;I love you, baby.&quot;

To help Crawford prepare for certain court scenes, Curtiz took her downtown, where they spent time visiting jails and watching criminal trials. In photographing her, he used careful film noir camera techniques, a style he learned in Europe, to bring out the features of Crawford&#x27;s face, using rich black-and-white highlights. He was aware that Crawford guarded her screen image very carefully, and that she truly cared about quality. Crawford learned to appreciate Curtiz&#x27;s genius with the camera. Eve Arden, who was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for the film, said &quot;Curtiz was one of the few directors who knew what he wanted and was able to express himself exactly, even in his amusing Hungarian accent.&quot;

&quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Only Crawford won, for Best Actress, her first and only Oscar. The novel&#x27;s author, James M. Cain, gave her a leather-bound copy of &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, which he inscribed: &quot;To Joan Crawford, who brought Mildred to life as I had always hoped she would be, and who has my lifelong gratitude.&quot; The film returned Crawford to the ranks of leading stars.

After the success of the film, Jack Warner gave Curtiz two new and exceptional contracts in appreciation, boosting his salary and reducing the number of films he had to direct each year to two.

Curtiz directed William Powell and Irene Dunne in &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947), a family comedy. It was a big hit in the United States, and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Powell. During Powell&#x27;s career, he acted in 97 films; his third and last nomination was for this film. One review stated, &quot;He is magnificent in the role, imbuing it with every attribute of pomp, dignity, unconscious conceit, and complete loveableness! His is one of the really great screen performances of the year ... that crowns a long screen life.&quot;

In the late 1940s, Curtiz made a new agreement with Warner Bros. under which the studio and his own production company were to share the costs and profits of his subsequent films with his films to be released through Warner Bros. &quot;I&#x27;m going to try to build my own stock company and make stars of unknowns. It is getting impossible to sign up the big stars, because they are tied up for the next two years,&quot; he said. He also said that he was less concerned with looks than personality when using an actor. &quot;If they are good-looking, that&#x27;s something extra. But I look for personality.&quot;

He soon learned that good stories were even harder to come by: &quot;Studios will pay anything for good stories ... they will buy it up before anyone else can get it,&quot; he complained. The story for &quot;Life With Father&quot; was said to have cost the studio $300,000, and the full budget for making the film was about $3 million.
The subsequent films did poorly, however, whether as part of the changes in the film industry in this period or because Curtiz &quot;had no skills in shaping the entirety of a picture&quot;. Either way, as Curtiz himself said, &quot;You are only appreciated so far as you carry the dough into the box office. They throw you into gutter next day&quot;.

=== 1950s ===

Curtiz&#x27;s films continued to cover a wide range of genres, including biopics, comedies, and musicals. Some of the box office successes and well-received films during the 1950s included &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950), &quot;Jim Thorpe – All-American&quot; (1951), &quot;The Story of Will Rogers&quot; (1952), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1955), and &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958).

&quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950) starred Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, and Doris Day, with Douglas portraying the rise and fall of a driven jazz musician, based on real-life cornet player Bix Beiderbecke. Curtiz directed an actual biopic, &quot;Jim Thorpe – All-American&quot; (1951), this time starring Burt Lancaster, based on the true story of a Native American athlete who won more gold medals than any other athlete at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The film received plaudits as one of the most compelling of all sports movies.

Curtiz followed with &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot; (1952), with Doris Day and Danny Thomas. The film is a musical biography of lyricist Gus Kahn. It was Day&#x27;s fourth film directed by Curtiz, who first auditioned her and gave her a starring role in her debut film, &quot;Romance on the High Seas&quot; (1948). She was shocked at being offered a lead in her first film, and admitted to Curtiz that she was a singer without acting experience. What Curtiz liked about her after the audition was that &quot;she was honest,&quot; he said, not afraid to tell him she was not an actress. That, and the observation &quot;her freckles made her look like the All-American Girl,&quot; he said. Day would be the discovery he boasted about most later in his career.

&quot;The Story of Will Rogers&quot; (1952), also a biography, told the story of the humorist and movie star Will Rogers, played by Will Rogers Jr., his son.

The long partnership between Curtiz and Warner Bros., eventually descended into a bitter court battle in the early 1950s. After his relationship with Warner Bros. broke down, Curtiz continued to direct on a freelance basis from 1954 onwards. &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954, based on Mika Waltari&#x27;s novel) for Fox starred Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, and Gene Tierney. He directed many films for Paramount, including &quot;White Christmas&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot;, and &quot;King Creole&quot;. &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), Curtiz&#x27;s second adaptation of an Irving Berlin musical, was a major box-office success, the highest-grossing film of 1954. It starred Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen.

Curtiz directed &quot;The Scarlet Hour&quot; (1956), which starred newcomers Carol Ohmart and Tom Tryon. It was reported that Curtiz was temperamental and disliked the script. The film was a commercial failure.
Another musical, &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958), starred Elvis Presley and Carolyn Jones. When asked to direct Presley, who was then the &quot;king of rock and roll&quot;, Curtiz could only laugh, assuming Presley would be unable to act. After a few conversations with him, however, his opinion changed: &quot;I began to sit up and take notice,&quot; Curtiz said, adding, &quot;I guarantee that he&#x27;ll amaze everyone. He shows formidable talent. What&#x27;s more, he&#x27;ll get the respect he so dearly desires.&quot; During filming, Presley was always the first one on the set. When he was told what to do, regardless of how unusual or difficult, he said simply, &quot;You&#x27;re the boss, Mr. Curtiz.&quot;
The script, the music, and the acting all came together to produce a remarkable picture, the likes of which Presley never again matched in his career. It received good reviews: &quot;Variety magazine&quot; declared that the film &quot;Shows the young star [Presley] as a better than fair actor&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave it a favorable review: &quot;As for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it&#x27;s a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin&#x27; and wigglin&#x27;. Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us, over a picket fence.&quot; Presley later thanked Curtiz for giving him the opportunity to show his potential as an actor; of his 33 films, Elvis considered it his favorite.

The final film that Curtiz directed was &quot;The Comancheros&quot;, released six months before his death from cancer on April 10, 1962. Curtiz was ill during the shoot, but star John Wayne took over directing on the days Curtiz was too ill to work. Wayne did not want to take a co-director credit.

== Directing style ==
=== Preparation ===
Curtiz always invested the time necessary to prepare all aspects of a film before shooting. &quot;As far as I am concerned,&quot; he said, &quot;the chief work in directing a film is in preparing a story for the screen ... Nothing is as important ... A director can be likened to the field general of an army. He should know more clearly than anyone else what is coming, what to expect ... I believe this as a sound working plan.&quot;

By putting time into preparation, he cut down on delays after production started, which gave him the ability to put out about six films a year until the 1940s. He turned out &quot;Front Page Woman&quot; (1935) in only three weeks, despite its rapid-fire newspaper dialogue with Bette Davis, then turned around and made &quot;Captain Blood&quot; almost entirely on the sound stage without having to leave the studio. (Errol Flynn&#x27;s duel with Basil Rathbone was shot at Three Arch Bay in Laguna Beach.)

=== Cinematography ===

Sidney Rosenzweig argues that Curtiz had his own personal style, which was in place by the time of his move to America: &quot;high crane shots to establish a story&#x27;s environment; unusual camera angles and complex compositions in which characters are often framed by physical objects; much camera movement; subjective shots, in which the camera becomes the character&#x27;s eye; and high contrast lighting with pools of shadows&quot;. Aljean Harmetz states that, &quot;Curtiz&#x27;s vision of any movie... was almost totally a visual one&quot;.

A few months after arriving in Hollywood as Warner Bros.&#x27; new director, Curtiz explained that he wanted to make viewers feel as though they were actually witnessing a story on screen:
In preparing scenes, Curtiz liked to compare himself to an artist, painting with characters, light, motion, and background on a canvas. However, during his career, this &quot;individualism,&quot; says Robertson, &quot;was hidden from public view&quot; and undervalued because, unlike many other directors, Curtiz&#x27;s films covered such a wide spectrum of different genres. He was therefore seen by many as a versatile master technician who worked under Warner Bros.&#x27; direction, rather than as an auteur with a unique and recognizable style.

Hal B. Wallis, the producer of many of Curtiz&#x27;s films, including &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, was always watchful over budgets. He wrote to Jack Warner during the shooting of that film, &quot;In his enthusiasm to make great shots and composition and utilize the great production values in this picture, he is, of course, more likely to go overboard than anyone else ... I did not try to stop Mike yesterday when he was on the crane and making establishing shots.&quot;

Curtiz himself rarely expressed his philosophy or filmmaking style in writing since he was always too busy making films, so no autobiography and only a few media interviews exist. His brother observed that Curtiz was &quot;shy, almost humble,&quot; in his private life, as opposed to his &quot;take-charge&quot; attitude at work. His brother added that &quot;he did not want anybody to write a book about him. He refused to even talk about the idea.&quot; When Curtiz was once asked to sum up his philosophy of making movies, he said, &quot;I put all the art into my pictures that I think the audience can stand.&quot;

=== Types of stories ===
Before coming to Hollywood, Curtiz always considered the story before he began working on a film. The human-interest side of a story was key, along with having the plot develop as the film progressed. He explains:

His attitude did not change when he joined a large studio, despite being given large spectacles to direct. As late as the 1940s, he still preferred &quot;homey pictures.&quot; He said it was &quot;because I want to deal with human and fundamental problems of real people. That is the basis of all good drama. It is true even in a spectacle, where you must never forget the underlying humanity and identity of your characters no matter how splendid the setting or situations are.&quot; However, he also felt that even with the same story, any five different directors would produce five distinctive versions. &quot;No two would be alike,&quot; he said, as each director&#x27;s &quot;work is reflection of himself.&quot;

Film historian Peter Wollen says that throughout Curtiz&#x27;s career, his films portrayed characters who had to &quot;deal with injustice, oppression, entrapment, displacement, and exile.&quot; He cites examples of Curtiz films to support that: &quot;20,000 Years in Sing Sing&quot; (1932) dealt with the theme of social alienation, while &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, and &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; all concerned a tyrant monarch who was threatening the freedom of ordinary Englishmen. Wollen states:

=== Personal habits ===

Curtiz was always extremely active: he worked very long days, took part in several sports in his spare time, and was often found to sleep under a cold shower. He skipped lunches since they interfered with his work and he felt they often made him tired. He was therefore dismissive of actors who ate lunch, believing that &quot;lunch bums&quot; had no energy for work in the afternoons.

Wallis said he was &quot;a demon for work.&quot; He arose each morning at 5 am and typically remained at the studio until 8 or 9 pm. He hated to go home at the end of the day, said Wallis. With his high energy level, he also attended to every minute detail on the set.

To broaden his life experiences in the U.S., since he seldom traveled outside of Hollywood, when he did go on location shoots 
he tended to be restless and curious about everything in the area. Producer Wallis, who was often with him, observed that he explored everything:
He earned the nickname &quot;Iron Mike&quot; from his friends, since he tried to keep physically fit by playing polo when he had time, and owned a stable of horses for his recreation at home. He attributed his fitness and level of energy solely to sober living. Even with his vast success and wealth over the years, he did not allow himself &quot;to be fondled in the lap of luxury.&quot;

=== Working with colleagues ===
The down side of his dedication was an often callous demeanor, which many attributed to his Hungarian roots. Fay Wray, who worked with Curtiz on &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot;, said, &quot;I felt that he was not flesh and bones, that he was part of the steel of the camera&quot;. Curtiz was not popular with most of his colleagues, many of whom thought him arrogant. Nor did he deny that, explaining, &quot;When I see a lazy man or a don&#x27;t care girl, it makes me tough. I am very critical of actors, but if I find a real actor, I am first to appreciate them.&quot;

Nevertheless, Bette Davis, who was little known in 1932, made five more films with him, although they argued consistently when filming &quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot; (1932), one of her earliest roles. He had a low opinion of actors in general, saying that acting &quot;is fifty percent a big bag of tricks. The other fifty percent should be talent and ability, although it seldom is.&quot; Overall, he got along well enough with his stars, as shown by his ability to attract and keep some of the best actors in Hollywood. He got along very well with Claude Rains, whom he directed in ten films.
Curtiz struggled with English as he was too busy filming to learn the language. He sometimes used pantomimes to show what he wanted an actor to do, which led to many amusing anecdotes about his choice of words when directing. David Niven never forgot Curtiz&#x27;s saying to &quot;bring on the empty horses&quot; when he wanted to &quot;bring out the horses without riders,&quot; so much so that he used it for the title of his memoir. Similar stories abound: For the final scene in &quot;Casablanca&quot; Curtiz asked the set designer for a &quot;poodle&quot; on the ground so the wet steps of the actors could be seen on camera. The next day the set designer brought a little dog not realizing Curtiz meant &quot;puddle&quot; not &quot;poodle&quot;. But not all actors who worked under Curtiz were as amused by his malapropisms. Edward G. Robinson, whom Curtiz directed in &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot;, had a different opinion about language handicaps by foreigners to Hollywood:
== Personal life ==
When he left for the United States, Curtiz left behind an illegitimate son and an illegitimate daughter. Around 1918, he married actress Lucy Doraine, and they divorced in 1923. He had a lengthy affair with Lili Damita starting in 1925 and is sometimes reported to have married her, but film scholar Alan K. Rode states in his 2017 biography of Curtiz that this is a modern legend, and there is no contemporary evidence to support it. Their obituaries make no mention of such a marriage.

Curtiz had left Europe before the rise of Nazism: other members of his family were less fortunate. He once asked Jack Warner, who was going to Budapest in 1938, to contact his family and help them get exit visas. Warner succeeded in getting Curtiz&#x27;s mother to the U.S., where she spent the rest of her life living with her son. He could not rescue Curtiz&#x27;s only sister, her husband, or their three children, who were sent to Auschwitz, where her husband and two of the children were murdered.

Curtiz paid part of his own salary into the European Film Fund, a benevolent association which helped European refugees in the film business establish themselves in the U.S.

In 1933, Curtiz became a naturalized U.S. citizen. By the early 1940s, he had become fairly wealthy, earning $3,600 per week and owning a substantial estate, complete with polo pitch. One of his regular polo partners was Hal B. Wallis, who had met Curtiz on his arrival in the country and had established a close friendship with him. Wallis&#x27; wife, the actress Louise Fazenda and Curtiz&#x27;s third wife, Bess Meredyth, an actress and screenwriter, had been close since before Curtiz&#x27;s marriage to Meredyth in 1929. Curtiz had numerous affairs; Meredyth once left him for a short time but they remained married until 1961, when they separated. They remained married until his death. She was Curtiz&#x27;s helper whenever his need to deal with scripts or other elements went beyond his grasp of English and he often phoned her for advice when presented with a problem while filming.

Curtiz was the stepfather of movie and television director John Meredyth Lucas, who talks about him in his autobiography &quot;Eighty Odd Years in Hollywood&quot;.

== Death ==
Curtiz died from cancer on April 10, 1962, aged 75. At the time of his death, he was living alone in a small apartment in Sherman Oaks, California. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Legacy ==
Curtiz directed some of the best known films of the 20th century, achieving numerous award-winning performances from actors. Before moving to Hollywood from his native Hungary when he was 38 years of age, he had already directed 64 films in Europe. He soon helped Warner Bros. become the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing studio, directing 102 films during his career in Hollywood, more than any other director. Jack Warner, who first discovered Curtiz after seeing one of his epics in Europe, called him &quot;Warner Brothers&#x27; greatest director.&quot;

He directed 10 actors to Oscar nominations: Paul Muni, John Garfield, James Cagney, Walter Huston, Humphrey Bogart, Claude Rains, Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, Eve Arden, and William Powell. Cagney and Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz&#x27;s direction, with Cagney on TV later attributing part of his success to &quot;the unforgettable Michael Curtiz.&quot; Curtiz himself was nominated five times and won as Best Director for &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

He earned a reputation as a harsh taskmaster to his actors, as he micromanaged every detail on the set. With his background as director since 1912, his experience and dedication to the art made him a perfectionist. He had an astounding mastery of technical details. Hal B. Wallis, who produced a number of his major films, including &quot;Casablanca&quot;, said Curtiz had always been his favorite director:
Some, such as screenwriter Robert Rossen, ask whether Curtiz has &quot;been misjudged by cinema history,&quot; since he is not included among those often considered to be great directors, such as John Ford, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock: &quot;He was obviously a talent highly alert to the creative movements of his time such as German expressionism, the genius of the Hollywood studio system, genres such as film noir, and the possibilities offered by talented stars.&quot;

Film historian Catherine Portuges has described Curtiz as one of the &quot;most enigmatic of film directors, and often underrated.&quot; Film theorist Peter Wollen wanted &quot;to resurrect&quot; Curtiz&#x27;s critical reputation, observing that with his enormous experience and drive, he &quot;could wring unexpected meanings from a script through his direction of actors and cinematographers.&quot;

The American Film Institute ranked &quot;Casablanca&quot; #3 and &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; #98 on its list of the greatest American movies. &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; were nominated for the list.

== Academy Award nominations ==
Six of Curtiz&#x27;s films were nominated for Best Picture: &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938), &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1943), and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945). Of these, only &quot;Casablanca&quot; won Best Picture.

<text>A banner can be a flag or another piece of cloth bearing a symbol, logo, slogan or another message. A flag whose design is the same as the shield in a coat of arms (but usually in a square or rectangular shape) is called a banner of arms. Also, a bar-shaped piece of non-cloth advertising material sporting a name, slogan, or other marketing message is also a banner.

Banner-making is an ancient craft. Church banners commonly portray the saint to whom the church is dedicated.

The word derives from Old French &quot;baniere&quot; (modern ), from Late Latin &quot;bandum&quot;, which was borrowed from a Germanic source (compare ). Cognates include Italian &quot;bandiera&quot;, Portuguese &quot;bandeira&quot;, and Spanish &quot;bandera&quot;.

== Vexillum ==

The vexillum was a flag-like object used as a military standard by units in the Ancient Roman army.

The word &quot;vexillum&quot; itself is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;velum&quot;, meaning a sail, which confirms the historical evidence (from coins and sculpture) that vexilla were literally &quot;little sails&quot; i.e. flag-like standards. In the vexillum the cloth was draped from a horizontal crossbar suspended from the staff; this is unlike most modern flags in which the &#x27;hoist&#x27; of the cloth is attached directly to the vertical staff.

==Heraldic banners==
A heraldic banner, also called a banner of arms, displays the basic coat of arms only: i.e. it shows the design usually displayed on the shield and omits the crest, helmet or coronet, mantling, supporters, motto or any other elements associated with the full armorial achievement (for further details of these elements, see heraldry). A heraldic banner is usually square or rectangular.

A distinction exists between the heraldic banner and the heraldic standard. The distinction, however, is often misunderstood or ignored. For example, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is in fact a banner of the royal arms.

== Banners in Christianity==

In the Old Testament, the prophet Isaiah was commanded to raise a banner and exalt his voice (). Habakkuk received a similar order to write a vision upon tables that could be read by one who runs past it ().

Banners in churches have, in the past, been used mainly for processions, both inside and outside of the church building. However, the emphasis has, in recent years, shifted markedly towards the permanent or transient display of banners on walls or pillars of churches and other places of worship. A famous example of large banners on display is Liverpool R.C. Cathedral, where the banners are designed by a resident artist.

Banners are also used to communicate the testimony of Jesus Christ by evangelists and public ministers engaged in Open Air Preaching.

==Trade union banners==

The iconography of these banners included mines, mills, and factories, but also visions of the future, showing a land where children and adults were well-fed and living in tidy brick-built houses, where the old and sick were cared for, where the burden of work was lessened by new technology, and where leisure time was increasing. The same kind of banners are also used in many other countries. Many, but not all of them, have red as a dominant colour.

In Australia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, trade union banners were unfurled with pride in annual Eight Hour Day marches which advocated &#x27;Eight Hours Labour, Eight Hours Recreation and Eight Hours Rest&#x27;. These marches were one of the most prominent annual celebrations staged in Australia by any group. In Sydney alone, by the early twentieth century, thousands of unionists representing up to seventy different unions would take part in such parades, marching behind the banner emblematic of their trade. Most of these banners have not survived; the Labour Council of NSW has the largest surviving collection at Sydney Trades Hall in Sussex Street, Sydney.

The State Library of NSW in Sydney has a small collection of trade union banners that were donated to the Library in the early 1970s such as a Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron &amp; Steel Shipbuilders of Australia banner thought to have been made c. 1913–1919. The Federated Society of Boilermakers, Iron &amp; Steel Shipbuilders of Australia was formed in 1873 and joined the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union in 1972.

The banner features a kneeling figure in the centre surrounded by scroll work and is decorated with Australian native flowers and images representative of the work of the Union&#x27;s members such as a New South Wales Government Railways 34 class steam locomotive, the Hawkesbury River rail bridge built in 1889, and a furnace. The reverse of the banner shows the warship &quot;Australia&quot; at sea. The banner is canvas and was painted by Sydney firm Althouse &amp; Geiger, master painters and decorators. Founded in 1875, the company is still in operation. The banner is a powerful interpretive tool in communicating the experience and the history of the Australian labour movement.

==Sports banners==
Sports fans often buy or make banners to display in the grandstands. Team banners typically contain the logo, name or nickname, motto and the team colors. Banners on individual competitors can contain a picture or drawing of the player. Sports banners may also honor notable players or hall-of-fame athletes and commemorate past championships won. These types of sports banners are typically hung from rafters in stadiums and arenas. In North American indoor professional sports, the previous season&#x27;s champion traditionally does not install their awarded championship banner until moments prior to their first home game of the season that follows, in a ceremony that is chiefly referred to as &quot;raising the banner&quot;.

Uruguay&#x27;s Club Nacional de Football supporters made a 600 x 50 metre banner that weighs over 2 tonnes; they claim it is the largest in the world. It was unveiled in April 2013 in a Copa Libertadores football match at the Estadio Centenario.

Rally towels serve some bannerlike cultural functions.

==Advertising banners==
Often fabricated commercially on a plastic background, the banner industry has developed from the traditional cut-vinyl banners to banners printed within large, ultra-wide format inkjet printers on various vinyl and fabric materials using solvent inks and ultraviolet-curable inks.

Banners are used in many business ventures, marketing to their potential audience. A number of British towns and cities have whole series of banners decorating their city centers, effectively advertising the town or its special features and attractions. Pre-printed banners, albeit commonly used, are simple and accessible. Banners can be printed in enormous formats, with a full range of rich colors. They can also be used in many different physical situations whether it be hanging from an existing fixture, fixed to a wall or even free standing. When an advertising banner is hung or suspended between posts, grommets or another method of attachment are necessary to prevent the banner from tearing or flying away. Aluminum grommets can be punched into the banner and used as secure entry points to tie the banner down. This installation method allows for more durable advertisements. Some vendors offer pre-installed grommets. Another common form of free standing banners are retractable displays.

Banners can be found plastered behind a window screen, as billboards, atop skyscrapers, or towed by airplanes or blimps. As with variable of size and quantity, the number of sides and quality of ink are as much of a crucial factor. In an instance of retail stores which purchase pre-printed clearance banners, or a variety of sale banner. A banner facing underneath or against glass is absorbing exposure from the sun. A banner printed on UV outdoor ink will last several years to a decade where cheaper ink fades, requiring frequent replacement. Being behind glass, a two-sided banner can be displayed from the inside and out, often building recognition between shoppers and caretakers. Three-sided banners are often appealing as there is dimension and can be embellished differently. The more sides that exist, the more angles the banner covers, which is a possibility where a two-sided banner doesn&#x27;t face the viewer from center of the room or streets.

Another manifestation of advertising banners, unique to the 21st century, are &quot;banner ads&quot;, which are advertisements on websites. The banner ads contain hyperlinks to other websites. Also, on free music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora, audio advertisements will play in between songs. One of the common tag lines is &quot;Click the banner to learn more.&quot;

==Big letter banners (China)==
In China, it is common to find large red coloured banners, especially in schools, factories, government institutions and construction sites. Also called da zi bao (), these tend to be big and long, usually with red backgrounds and large Chinese characters. They tend to have motivational messages or industrial milestones on them. Historically, these big-character posters were used to convey messages during the cultural revolution, but their use changed after the country&#x27;s liberalization since 1979.

<text>Elsa Beskow ( Maartman; 11February 187430June 1953) was a famous Swedish author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Among her better known books are &quot;Tale of the Little Little Old Woman&quot; and &quot;Aunt Green, Aunt Brown and Aunt Lavender&quot;.

== Background ==
Born in Stockholm her parents were businessman Bernt Maartman (1841–1889), whose family came from Bergen, Norway, and Augusta Fahlstedt (1850–1915). Beskow studied Art Education at Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, then called &quot;Tekniska skolan&quot;, or the Technical school, in Stockholm.

She married former minister and social worker, doctor of theology Natanael Beskow in 1897. Elsa Beskow met her future husband at Djursholms samskola while serving as a teacher where he served as head master. From 1900 they lived in Villa Ekeliden in Djursholm which had initially been built for the author Viktor Rydberg. They had six sons, including the artist Bo Beskow (1906–1989) and geologist Gunnar Beskow (1901–1991).

== Career ==
In 1894 Beskow started to contribute to the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Jultomten&quot;. She ultimately began publishing her own books, doing both illustration and text. Overall, she would publish some forty books with her own text and images. 

Beskow frequently combined reality with elements from the fairy tale world. Children meet elves or goblins, and farm animals talk with people. Central themes were the relationships between children and adults and children&#x27;s independent initiative. Her work &quot;depicted a happy home atmosphere in the Swedish countryside of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&quot;

Beskow became one of the most well known of all Swedish children&#x27;s book artists. Many of her books became classics and are continually reprinted. Beskow also illustrated ABC books and songbooks for Swedish schools. Her book pages are often framed by decorative framework of the Art Nouveau style.

Beskow received &quot;international recognition for simple, cheerful stories and outstanding illustrations.&quot;

<text>Carl Oscar (or Oskar) Borg (March 3, 1879 – May 8, 1947) was a Swedish-born painter who settled in the United States and became known for views of California and the SouthWest.

==Biography==

Carl Oscar Borg was born into a poor family in Grinstad parish, Dalsland province, Sweden. Oscar Borg moved to London at age 15 to assist portrait and marine artist George Johansen. In 1901, he sailed for the United States. Borg taught art at the California Art Institute in Los Angeles and at the Santa Barbara School of the Arts. He became a protégé of American philanthropist and art patron Phoebe Hearst. She gave him the opportunity to return to Europe to study art.

Borg was influenced by the nature of the southwestern United States, especially the states of Arizona and New Mexico. He worked in various mediums including oil, watercolor, etchings, and woodblock. He was commissioned to paint posters for the railway company, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. His posters were put up on the company&#x27;s sales offices and attracted attention. He was known for his dramatic paintings of the Grand Canyon.

Borg was a founding member of the Painter&#x27;s Club of Los Angeles and the California Art Club. He was one of the first art directors for a major movie studio in Hollywood. He worked with the production of silent films in the years 1925–1928. Examples of his art are on display at Brigham Young University, Harvard University, Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. A substantial collection of his paintings and prints, as well as large parts of his personal collection were given to the Världskulturmuseet in Gothenburg and Etnografiska museet in Stockholm, both branches of the Statens museer för världskultur (National Museums of World Culture) in Sweden as gifts during his lifetime and by his widow.

His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
Borg was married to Lily Borg Elmberg. He was a member of the National Academy of Design, the National Academy of Arts, Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salmagundi Club.

<text>Percy Nils Barnevik HonFREng (born 13 February 1941) is a Swedish business executive, best known as CEO and later Chairman of ABB 1988–2002, and for being the centre of a giant pension dispute that shook Sweden in 2003. He is the co-founder of the non-profit organization Hand in Hand.

==Background==
Born in Simrishamn in southern Sweden, the youngest of three children, he grew up in Uddevalla, north of Gothenburg, where his parents operated a small printing company. Barnevik was educated at the University of Gothenburg&#x27;s School of Business, Economics and Law and at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He has received seven honorary doctorates in Sweden, Finland and the U.S., including from Linköping University (1989) and the University of Gothenburg (1991). In 1993, Barnevik received the IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award.

==Career==
Barnevik started his professional career in the Swedish company Datema, but soon moved to Sandvik. In Sandviken, where between the years 1969 and 1970 he hired over 150 people, his employees said &quot;he has some kind of magic in him—you just can&#x27;t refuse his offer.&quot; He developed unique relationships with many of his colleagues which helped him to improve the communication. In 1975, he was promoted to CEO of Sandvik&#x27;s American operations, Sandvik Steel. Within the next four years he tripled the revenues, grossing $250 million, and turned the company profitable. During his work in the United States, Sandvik started competing against the industry leaders, such as General Electric and U.S. Steel.

In 1979 he joined ASEA, a leading Swedish heavy industrial company based in Västerås. In 1987 he decided to merge with its Swiss competitor – Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. It was the largest merger at that time. He held the position of CEO of ASEA 1980–87, was CEO of ABB from 1988 to 1996. He was Chairman of Sandvik 1983–2002, Chairman of Skanska 1992–1997, Chairman of Investor AB 1997–2002, Chairman of AstraZeneca 1999–2004, Chairman of ABB 1996–2002, Member of the Board of DuPont, USA 1991–1998 and Member of the Board of General Motors, USA 1996–2009. He was also a regular Bilderberg Group attendee 1992–2001 and belonged to the group&#x27;s Steering Committee.

During his eight years as CEO of ASEA followed by the nine years as CEO of ABB, the company achieved an increase of stock value of 87 times or 30% average per year over the 17 years. Net profit increased 60 times and sales 30 times. Based upon these extraordinary results Barnevik received a one-off payment of 148 million Swiss francs when he retired as CEO in 1996. 2002, six years later under a second succeeding CEO, ABB stock market value plummeted from 54.50 francs in 2000 to just under 15 francs. When ABB&#x27;s board made the pension payment public, a huge scandal ensued and Barnevik was forced to resign as chairman of Investor, the Swedish investment company controlled by the powerful Wallenberg family, and to hand back a large chunk of his pension to ABB.

==Philanthropy==
In 2003, Barnevik co-founded charity Hand in Hand with Dr Kalpana Sankar in Tamil Nadu, India. The charity, which fights poverty through job and business creation, has since grown to include programs in 10 countries: Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, India, Afghanistan and, more recently, Cambodia and Myanmar. Hand in Hand&#x27;s mission is to work for economic and social empowerment of the poorest and most marginalized people by supporting the development of businesses and jobs. Since 2003, the Hand in Hand network has helped start and sustain 1.3 million businesses and has generated 1.9 million jobs.

==Personal life==
Barnevik lived in London. In an interview he once stated that he took a test which stated he was unsuitable for a managerial position.

==Current affiliations==

*Member of the Advisory Council of Centre for European Reform, UK

<text>Carl Michael Bellman (; 4 February 1740 – 11 February 1795) was a Swedish songwriter, composer, musician, poet, and entertainer. He is a central figure in the Swedish song tradition and remains a powerful influence in Swedish music, as well as in Scandinavian literature, to this day. He has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth, but his gift, using elegantly rococo classical references in comic contrast to sordid drinking and prostitution—at once regretted and celebrated in song—is unique.

Bellman is best known for two collections of poems set to music, &quot;Fredman&#x27;s epistles&quot; (&quot;Fredmans epistlar&quot;) and &quot;Fredman&#x27;s songs&quot; (&quot;Fredmans sånger&quot;). Each consists of about 70 songs. The general theme is drinking, but the songs &quot;most ingeniously&quot; combine words and music to express feelings and moods ranging from humorous to elegiac, romantic to satirical.

Bellman&#x27;s patrons included King Gustav III of Sweden, who called him a master improviser. Bellman&#x27;s songs continue to be performed and recorded by musicians from Scandinavia and in other languages, including English, French, German, Italian, and Russian. Several of his songs including &quot;Gubben Noak&quot; and &quot;Fjäriln vingad&quot; are known by heart by many Swedes. His legacy further includes a museum in Stockholm and a society that fosters interest in him and his work.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Carl Michael Bellman was born on 4 February 1740 in the Stora Daurerska house, which was one of the finest in the Södermalm district of Stockholm. The house was the property of his maternal grandmother, Catharina von Santen, who had brought up his father, orphaned as a small child. Carl Michael&#x27;s parents were Johan Arndt Bellman, a civil servant, and Catharina Hermonia, daughter of the priest of the local Maria parish. Her family was wholly Swedish, whereas Johan&#x27;s family had German origins: they had come from Bremen in about 1660. When Carl Michael was four the family moved to a smaller, single storey dwelling called the Lilla Daurerska house. He briefly went to a local school, but was educated mainly by private tutors. He was the eldest of 15 children who lived long enough for their births to be registered. His parents had intended him to become a priest, but he fell ill with a fever, and on recovering found he could express any thought in rhyming verse. His parents appointed a tutor called Ennes who Bellman called &quot;a genius&quot;. Bellman was taught French, German, Italian, English, and Latin. He read Horace and Boileau; Ennes taught him to write poetry and to translate French and German hymns. He was familiar with stories from the Bible including the Apocrypha, many of which found their way into the songs he composed in later life. However, expenses including the Swedish tradition of hospitality left the family with no money to start him off in life with a journey to the south of Europe, such as to Spain to visit his uncle, Jacob Martin Bellman, who was the Swedish Consul in Cádiz. Carl Michael translated a French book by Du Four and dedicated it to his uncle, but the hint was ignored. Deep in debt, at the end of 1757 the family sent Carl Michael to Sweden&#x27;s central bank Riksbanken as an unpaid trainee. He had no aptitude for numbers, instead discovering the taverns and brothels which were to figure so largely in his songs.
As the banking career was not working out – and as trainees were (after a period with a relaxed regime) again required to sit an exam, for which Bellman was ill-equipped – he took a break in 1758, going to Uppsala University, where Linnaeus was professor of botany. The idea of attending lectures was no more congenial than banking, and he stayed only one term; one of his songs (FS 28) records that &quot;He contemplated Uppsala—the beer stung his mouth—love distracted his wits...&quot; However, he met young men (such as Carl Bonde) from wealthy and noble families, went drinking with them, and started to entertain them with his songs. Bellman returned to the bank job, and seems quickly to have fallen into financial difficulty: &quot;a jungle of debts, sureties and bondsmen began to proliferate around him.&quot; The character of bailiff Blomberg appears in his songs (e.g. FS 14), constantly trying to track down debtors and seize all their property. The law allowed the bankrupt only one way to escape from debtors&#x27; prison: to leave Sweden. In 1763, Bellman ran away to Norway. From the safety of Halden (then called Fredrikshald) he writes to the Council applying first for a passport, and then for a safe-conduct, both of which were granted. Meanwhile, his father had first mortgaged the Lilla Daurerska house, and then sold it: the family&#x27;s finances were no better than his own. Even worse, by April 1764 the Bank had become tired of the riotous behaviour of its young men: its investigations showed that Bellman had been the ringleader, leading them (the Bank wrote) into &quot;gambling, masquerades, picnics and suchlike&quot;. Bellman resigned, his safe banking career at an end.

=== Poetry and song ===

In 1765, Bellman&#x27;s parents died; deeply moved, he wrote a religious poem. Then his fortunes improved: someone found him a job, first in the Office of Manufactures, then in the Customs, and he was able once again to live happily in Stockholm, observing the people of the city, with at least a modest salary. In 1768, his life&#x27;s work as we now know it got under way:

Bellman mostly played the cittern, becoming the most famous player of this instrument in Sweden. His portrait by Per Krafft shows him playing an oval instrument with twelve strings, arranged as six pairs. His first songs were &quot;parody songs&quot;, a common form of entertainment at the time.

Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, as well as many poems. He attempted to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain the permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776, the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him for the rest of his life.

On 19 December 1777, at the age of 37, he married the 22-year-old Lovisa Grönlund in Klara Church. They had four children, Gustav, Elis, Karl, and Adolf; Elis died young.
Throughout his life, but especially during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out &quot;The Temple of Bacchus&quot; (&quot;Bacchi Tempel&quot;), perhaps hoping to establish his reputation as a poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people&#x27;s minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.

Bellman&#x27;s main works are the 82 &quot;Fredman&#x27;s epistles&quot; (&quot;Fredmans epistlar&quot;, 1790) and the 65 &quot;Fredman&#x27;s songs&quot; (&quot;Fredmans sånger&quot;, 1791). Their themes include the pleasures of drunkenness and sex. Against this backdrop, Bellman deals with themes of love, death, and the transitoriness of life. The settings of his songs reflect life in 18th-century Stockholm, but often refer to Greek and Roman mythological characters such as the goddess of love, Venus (or her Swedish equivalent, Fröja), Neptune and his retinue of water-nymphs, the love-god Cupid, the ferryman Charon and Bacchus, the god of wine and pleasure. Many of &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; are peopled by a cast which includes the clockmaker Jean Fredman, the prostitute or &quot;nymph&quot; Ulla Winblad, the alcoholic ex-soldier Movitz, and Father Berg, a virtuoso on several instruments. Some of these were based on living models, others probably not. Ulla Winblad was widely believed to have been closely based on Maria Kristina Kiellström, though the real woman, a silk worker once arrested for alleged prostitution, was not the ideal romantic figure of Bellman&#x27;s songs. &quot;Fredman&#x27;s songs&quot; also include Old Testament figures such as Noah and Judith.

Bellman achieved his effects of rococo elegance and humour through precisely organised incongruity. For example, Epistle 25, &quot;Blåsen nu alla!&quot; (All blow now!), begins with Venus crossing the water, as in François Boucher&#x27;s&quot;Triumph of Venus&quot;, but when she disembarks, Bellman transforms her into a lustful &quot;Ulla Winblad&quot;. Similarly, the ornate and civilized minuet melody of &quot;Ack du min Moder&quot; (Alas, thou my mother) contrasts with the text: Fredman is lying with a hangover in the gutter outside a tavern, complaining bitterly about life. Ulla Winblad (&quot;vineleaf&quot;) recurs through the Epistles; Britten Austin comments that

The songs are &quot;most ingeniously&quot; set to music, the melodies accentuated by the bold construction of music, word pictures and choice of words, while the music brings out a hidden dimension not seen if the words are simply read as verse. The poems themselves, far from being the brilliant improvisations that they appear, are striking in their &quot;formal virtuosity&quot;. They may be drinking songs in name, but in structure they are tightly woven into a precise metre, situating the &quot;frenzied bacchanalia within a strict and decorous rococo frame.&quot; The musicologist James Massengale writes that the technique of reusing tunes in musical parody had already been overused and had fallen into disrepute by Bellman&#x27;s time, just as his subject matter was initially looked down on. Despite this, Massengale argues

Massengale observes that Bellman was &quot;fully aware of the complexity of the musical-poetic problem; his poems were not simply talented improvisations.&quot; and points out that Bellman was &quot;also interested in concealing this complexity&quot;, with the discrepancies between the music and the poetry &quot;&quot;apparently&quot; resolved&quot;.

Bellman was a gifted entertainer and mimic. He was able to

In 1790, the Swedish Academy awarded Bellman its annual Lundblad prize of 50 Riksdaler for the most interesting piece of literature of the year. Although &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; was neither exactly literature as understood by the academy, nor meeting the standards of elegant taste, the poet and critic Johan Henric Kellgren and the King ensured that Bellman won the prize.

=== Later life ===
After the assassination of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.

As well as being ill, he was imprisoned—after struggling with debts and haunted by the threat of ruin and imprisonment all his life—&quot;for a wretched[ly small] debt of 150 Rdr&quot;. The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G. Nobelius, had had his advances to Louise Bellman rejected, and in revenge had sued Bellman for the debt, knowing he was penniless: he owed a total of almost 4,000 Riksdaler. On 11 February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.

== Reception ==
King Gustav III called Bellman &quot;Il signor improvisatore&quot; (The master improviser).

Bellman has been compared with poets and musicians as diverse as Shakespeare and Beethoven. Åse Kleveland notes that he has been called &quot;Swedish poetry&#x27;s Mozart, and Hogarth&quot;, observing that

Paul Britten Austin says instead simply that:

== Legacy ==

=== Performance and recordings ===

Bellman&#x27;s informal &quot;Bacchi Orden&quot; (Order of Bacchus) was replaced in the 1770s by the more structured Bacchanalian society &quot;Par Bricole&quot;, which still exists in the 21st century. It enabled Bellman to publish his book &quot;Bacchi Tempel&quot; in 1783. When the tradition of solo performance of his songs died out, &quot;Par Bricole&quot; continued to perform his songs as choral pieces.

Bellman&#x27;s poetry continued to be read and sung throughout the 19th century, contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period. His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities, but also in aristocratic circles and ordinary people in the countryside. The &quot;Orphei Drängar&quot; Vocal Society, named after a phrase in Epistle 14, was founded in Uppsala in 1853; the song became their trademark. The &quot;Epistles&quot; and &quot;Songs&quot; were published in chapbooks, sung at festivals and performed in a variety of concerts and entertainments. Figures such as Fredman, Ulla Winblad and Movitz, as well as Bellman himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates, beer tankards and hipflasks. Curiously, Bellman was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles, though with bowdlerized versions of the songs.

Major interpreters of Bellman&#x27;s songs include Sven-Bertil Taube, who helped to start the 1960s Bellman renaissance; Fred Åkerström, who brought a fresh earthiness to Bellman interpretation; and the Dutch-born Cornelis Vreeswijk, who fitted Bellman to the style of American blues. Other recordings have been made by Evert Taube, and as rock music by Joakim Thåström, Candlemass or Marduk. They are also performed as choral music and as drinking songs. Martin Bagge has recreated Bellman&#x27;s dramatic style complete with period costume. In 2020, Uppsala stadsteater and Västmanlands Teater created &quot;Bellman 2.0&quot;, a costumed theatre concert, directed by Nikolaj Cederholm with &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; and &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Songs&quot; arranged by Kåre Bjerkø for guitar, electric guitar, double bass, cello, tuba, clarinet, drumkit and percussion, keyboards, accordion, and five voices.

=== Translations ===

Bellman has been translated into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and German, including by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman&#x27;s songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen was one of the first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman&#x27;s songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including &quot;Gubben Noak&quot; and &quot;Fjäriln vingad&quot; are known by heart by many Swedes.

Books in English with translations of Bellman&#x27;s work have been written by Charles Wharton Stork in 1917, Hendrik Willem van Loon in 1939, Paul Britten Austin, and the historian Michael Roberts. In English, the most thorough treatment of Bellman&#x27;s life is also by Britten Austin. Van Loon&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Troubadours: The Life and Music of Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795)&quot; was inspired by a visit to Sweden, and tried to introduce the unknown Bellman to an American audience, but critics felt his version of twenty of the songs was &quot;stiff and often ungraceful&quot;, not doing justice to their composer.

=== Memorials ===

Bellman was the subject of an 1844 ballet choreographed by August Bournonville. Bellman features as a character, along with Ulla Winblad and King Gustav III, in the first episode of the Swedish television series &quot;Nisse Hults historiska snedsteg&quot; (Nisse Hult&#x27;s historical slips) by SVT Drama. Bellman appears with his cittern and various objects from &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot; and &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Songs&quot; on a 100 Swedish kronor postage stamp issued in 2014 and designed by Beata Boucht; he was shown on earlier Swedish stamps in 1940 and 1990, commemorating the 200th and 250th anniversaries of his birth, and again in 2006. Bellmansgatan in Stockholm&#x27;s Södermalm district is named for Bellman; Stieg Larsson places the apartment of his &quot;Millennium&quot; trilogy hero Mikael Blomkvist in Bellmansgatan, which Dan Burstein and Arne de Keijzer suggest is meant to provide Bellman associations.

=== Bellman jokes ===

Swedish schoolchildren tell Bellman jokes about a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster with little or no connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th-century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman&#x27;s life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the &#x27;Bellman&#x27; character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.

=== Bellman museum ===

Stora Henriksvik, also called the Bellman museum (&quot;Bellmanmuseet&quot;) for its small permanent Bellman exhibition, celebrates his life and work with paintings, replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th-century Stockholm house. The place, beside the beach at Långholm, was in Bellman&#x27;s time called &quot;Lilla Sjötullen&quot; (The Small Lake-Customs House) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay a toll on the goods they were taking to market in Stockholm&#x27;s &quot;Gamla stan&quot;. The place is mentioned in Epistle No. 48, &quot;Solen glimmar blank och trind&quot;.

=== Bellman society ===

The Bellman Society (&quot;Bellmansällskapet&quot;), founded in Stockholm on the anniversary of Bellman&#x27;s birth in 1919, fosters interest in Bellman and supports research into the man and his work. To these ends it organises concerts, lectures, and excursions. It produces the series of &quot;Bellmanstudier&quot;, starting in 1924, so far running to 24 volumes, as well as facsimile prints of Bellman documents, essay collections, and Yngve Berg&#x27;s Bellman porcelain. It has published recordings including &quot;Alla Fredmans Epistlar&quot; (All Fredman&#x27;s Epistles) and &quot;Alla Fredmans Sånger&quot; (All Fredman&#x27;s Songs). The Society&#x27;s newsletter is called &quot;Hwad behagas?&quot;. Sister societies in other countries include the Danish &quot;Selskabet Bellman i Danmark&quot;, and the German &quot;Deutsche Bellman-Gesellschaft&quot;.

<text>Gösta Ingvar Carlsson (born 9 November 1934) is a Swedish politician who twice served as Prime Minister of Sweden, first from 1986 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1996. He was leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1986 to 1996. He led Sweden into the European Union.

Carlsson was a member of the Riksdag from 1965 to 1996 representing the constituency of Stockholm County (until 1970 in the lower house). He served as Minister of Education from 1969 to 1973, as Minister of Housing in 1973 and again from 1974 to 1976, and as Minister of Environmental affairs from 1985 to 1986. He served as deputy prime minister from 1982 to 1986, and assumed office as Prime Minister of Sweden upon the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986.

== Early life ==
Carlsson was born in Borås, Västra Götaland County (then Älvsborg County), Sweden and is the third son of the warehouse worker Olof Karlsson and Ida, née Johansson. At the age of 12, Carlsson found his father dead on the floor of the coffee roastery where he worked.

Carlsson has a diploma in business economics and a degree in political science from Lund University. In Lund he met with Tage Erlander, the Swedish prime minister, and his aide Olof Palme, later to become Erlander&#x27;s successor. He graduated in 1952. He would receive an honorary doctorate from Lund University in 1989.

== Early political career ==

After finishing studies Carlsson got a job in Erlander&#x27;s staff, along with other young aides such as Palme and Bengt K. Å. Johansson. Erlander called this group &quot;the boys&quot;. In 1965, Carlsson attended Northwestern University in Illinois in the United States as a Fulbright scholar studying economics. After returning home, he was elected member of the Swedish Parliament. In the same year, he also became leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League. He had the following ministerial posts: Minister of Education 1969-1973, Minister of Housing 1973-1976, deputy prime minister 1982-1986.

He was deputy prime minister to Prime Minister Olof Palme when Palme was assassinated.

== Prime minister ==
===First premiership (1986-1991)===

Following the assassination of Olof Palme in 1986, Ingvar Carlsson became the new prime minister or &quot;Statsminister&quot; and party leader. Together with Minister for Finance Kjell-Olof Feldt, the government turned a budget deficit of 90 billion SEK to a surplus of a few hundred billion SEK, which initially led to large investments and record low unemployment. 1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.

However, Sweden&#x27;s economy began to deteriorate in the early 1990s. In 1990 the Carlsson cabinet resigned after failing to gain a majority for its economic policy agenda, but was reinstated immediately with a slightly changed agenda.

In 1987, he visited United States President Ronald Reagan at the White House, becoming the first Swedish prime minister to visit a U.S. president since Erlander met John F. Kennedy in 1961.

===Second premiership (1994-1996)===

The Social Democrats lost the elections in 1991, but Carlsson returned to power after the elections in 1994. When the Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, they responded to the fiscal crisis by stabilizing the currency—and by reducing the welfare state and privatizing public services and goods, as governments did in many countries influenced by Milton Friedman, the Chicago Schools of political and economic thought, and the neoliberal movement.
As Prime Minister, he also carried out a comprehensive reform of the tax system.

After three years in opposition and an election victory in the 1994 elections, Carlsson formed a new government. This government realigned its focus on cleaning up Swedish Government finances, and the task was assigned to the newly appointed Minister of Finance Göran Persson. The ensuing governing period was difficult and it was strongly criticized by trade unions and party members for government service cuts and tax increases that were instituted. On 19 December 1994, Carlsson announced the decision not to recover the wreck of the MS Estonia, or even the bodies of the victims of the disaster.

Carlsson pushed for Sweden to join the European Union, seeing it as necessary for Sweden to strengthen its economy, although other members of his party were sceptical of the idea. After four years of negotiations and a large campaign credited with increasing EU support, a national referendum was held on 13 October 1994, with 83% voter turnout (the highest for a Swedish referendum up to that point), and 52.3% voting to join. Sweden joined in January 1995 alongside Austria and Finland.

In August 1995, Ingvar Carlsson announced that he would resign as party leader and Swedish Prime Minister. His successor was long considered to be the then Minister of Equality and Deputy Prime Minister Mona Sahlin. However, due to the so-called Toblerone Affair, she took back her candidacy and also later resigned from the government. On 5 December 1995, the nominating committee proposed the Minister for Finance, Göran Persson, as the new party leader candidate. He was elected on 15 March 1996 at the Social Democratic Party Congress as party leader and on 22 March 1996 he was elected Prime Minister.

== Later life ==

Ingvar Carlsson was Chairman of the inquiry after the Gothenburg Riots of 2001 to investigate the events. Their report was submitted to the Government on 14 January 2003.

Ingvar Carlsson was the Chairman of the Independent Inquiry into United Nations actions during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. He is also chairman of the Bergman Foundation Center on Fårö.

With Shridath Ramphal, he was in 1995 one of the co-chairs of the Commission on Global Governance, which reported on issues of international development, international security, globalization and global governance.

In 2024, he was made the first honorary member of Lund University.

His career has been shaped by the heritage of Olof Palme, with whom he worked closely, but his policies are more seen as being a continuation of the legacy established by Tage Erlander.

==Personal life==
On 10 July 1957 Carlsson married librarian Ingrid Melander (born 9 April 1934), daughter of the wholesaler Sven H. Melander and Gerda Melander (née Eriksson). They have two daughters and three grandchildren. Twelve years prior to 2024, Ingrid was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and by 2024 Carlsson had her placed in a nursing home in Tyresö, which he visits three times a week. As of 2023, he lives in an apartment in the same municipality.

Ingvar Carlsson is a big supporter of football teams IF Elfsborg and Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
