<text>A seismic wave is a mechanical wave of acoustic energy that travels through the Earth or another planetary body. It can result from an earthquake (or generally, a quake), volcanic eruption, magma movement, a large landslide and a large man-made explosion that produces low-frequency acoustic energy. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists, who record the waves using seismometers, hydrophones (in water), or accelerometers. Seismic waves are distinguished from seismic noise (ambient vibration), which is persistent low-amplitude vibration arising from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources.
The propagation velocity of a seismic wave depends on density and elasticity of the medium as well as the type of wave. Velocity tends to increase with depth through Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle, but drops sharply going from the mantle to Earth&#x27;s outer core.

Earthquakes create distinct types of waves with different velocities. When recorded by a seismic observatory, their different travel times help scientists locate the quake&#x27;s hypocenter. In geophysics, the refraction or reflection of seismic waves is used for research into Earth&#x27;s internal structure. Scientists sometimes generate and measure vibrations to investigate shallow, subsurface structure.

== Types ==
Among the many types of seismic waves, one can make a broad distinction between &quot;body waves&quot;, which travel through the Earth, and &quot;surface waves&quot;, which travel at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Other modes of wave propagation exist than those described in this article; though of comparatively minor importance for earth-borne waves, they are important in the case of asteroseismology.

* Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth.
* Surface waves travel across the surface. Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves which travel in three dimensions.
* Particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.

=== Body waves ===
Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth along paths controlled by the material properties in terms of density and modulus (stiffness). The density and modulus, in turn, vary according to temperature, composition, and material phase. This effect resembles the refraction of light waves. Two types of particle motion result in two types of body waves: Primary and Secondary waves. This distinction was recognized in 1830 by the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson.
==== Primary waves ====

Primary waves (P waves) are compressional waves that are longitudinal in nature. P waves are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through the earth to arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name &quot;Primary&quot;. These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel nearly 1.7 times faster than the S waves. In air, they take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound. Typical speeds are 330 m/s in air, 1450 m/s in water and about 5000 m/s in granite.

==== Secondary waves ====

Secondary waves (S waves) are shear waves that are transverse in nature. Following an earthquake event, S waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving P waves and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, in the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. S waves are slower than P waves, and speeds are typically around 60% of that of P waves in any given material. Shear waves can not travel through any liquid medium, so the absence of S waves in earth&#x27;s outer core suggests a liquid state.

=== Surface waves ===
Seismic surface waves travel along the Earth&#x27;s surface. They can be classified as a form of mechanical surface wave. Surface waves diminish in amplitude as they get farther from the surface and propagate more slowly than seismic body waves (P and S). Surface waves from very large earthquakes can have globally observable amplitude of several centimeters.

==== Rayleigh waves ====
Rayleigh waves, also called ground roll, are surface waves that propagate with motions that are similar to those of waves on the surface of water (note, however, that the associated seismic particle motion at shallow depths is typically retrograde, and that the restoring force in Rayleigh and in other seismic waves is elastic, not gravitational as for water waves). The existence of these waves was predicted by John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, in 1885. They are slower than body waves, e.g., at roughly 90% of the velocity of S waves for typical homogeneous elastic media. In a layered medium (e.g., the crust and upper mantle) the velocity of the Rayleigh waves depends on their frequency and wavelength. See also Lamb waves.

==== Love waves ====

Love waves are horizontally polarized shear waves (SH waves), existing only in the presence of a layered medium. They are named after Augustus Edward Hough Love, a British mathematician who created a mathematical model of the waves in 1911. They usually travel slightly faster than Rayleigh waves, about 90% of the S wave velocity.

==== Stoneley waves ====

A Stoneley wave is a type of boundary wave (or interface wave) that propagates along a solid-fluid boundary or, under specific conditions, also along a solid-solid boundary. Amplitudes of Stoneley waves have their maximum values at the boundary between the two contacting media and decay exponentially away from the contact. These waves can also be generated along the walls of a fluid-filled borehole, being an important source of coherent noise in vertical seismic profiles (VSP) and making up the low frequency component of the source in sonic logging.
The equation for Stoneley waves was first given by Dr. Robert Stoneley (1894–1976), emeritus professor of seismology, Cambridge.

==== Normal modes ====
Free oscillations of the Earth are standing waves, the result of interference between two surface waves traveling in opposite directions. Interference of Rayleigh waves results in &quot;spheroidal oscillation S&quot; while interference of Love waves gives &quot;toroidal oscillation T&quot;. The modes of oscillations are specified by three numbers, e.g., nSlm, where &quot;l&quot; is the angular order number (or &quot;spherical harmonic degree&quot;, see Spherical harmonics for more details). The number &quot;m&quot; is the azimuthal order number. It may take on 2&quot;l&quot;+1 values from −&quot;l&quot; to +&quot;l&quot;. The number &quot;n&quot; is the &quot;radial order number&quot;. It means the wave with &quot;n&quot; zero crossings in radius. For spherically symmetric Earth the period for given &quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot; does not depend on &quot;m&quot;.

Some examples of spheroidal oscillations are the &quot;breathing&quot; mode 0S0, which involves an expansion and contraction of the whole Earth, and has a period of about 20 minutes; and the &quot;rugby&quot; mode 0S2, which involves expansions along two alternating directions, and has a period of about 54 minutes. The mode 0S1 does not exist because it would require a change in the center of gravity, which would require an external force.

Of the fundamental toroidal modes, 0T1 represents changes in Earth&#x27;s rotation rate; although this occurs, it is much too slow to be useful in seismology. The mode 0T2 describes a twisting of the northern and southern hemispheres relative to each other; it has a period of about 44 minutes.

The first observations of free oscillations of the Earth were done during the great 1960 earthquake in Chile. Presently the periods of thousands of modes have been observed. These data are used for constraining large scale structures of the Earth&#x27;s interior.

=== P and S waves in Earth&#x27;s mantle and core ===
When an earthquake occurs, seismographs near the epicenter are able to record both P and S waves, but those at a greater distance no longer detect the high frequencies of the first S wave. Since shear waves cannot pass through liquids, this phenomenon was original evidence for the now well-established observation that the Earth has a liquid outer core, as demonstrated by Richard Dixon Oldham. This kind of observation has also been used to argue, by seismic testing, that the Moon has a solid core, although recent geodetic studies suggest the core is still molten.

== Notation ==

The naming of seismic waves is usually based on the wave type and its path; due to the theoretically infinite possibilities of travel paths and the different areas of application, a wide variety of nomenclatures have emerged historically, the standardization of which – for example in the &quot;IASPEI Standard Seismic Phase List&quot; – is still an ongoing process. The path that a wave takes between the focus and the observation point is often drawn as a ray diagram. Each path is denoted by a set of letters that describe the trajectory and phase through the Earth. In general, an upper case denotes a transmitted wave and a lower case denotes a reflected wave. The two exceptions to this seem to be &quot;g&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.
For example:
* ScP is a wave that begins traveling towards the center of the Earth as an S wave. Upon reaching the outer core the wave reflects as a P wave.
* sPKIKP is a wave path that begins traveling towards the surface as an S wave. At the surface, it reflects as a P wave. The P wave then travels through the outer core, the inner core, the outer core, and the mantle.

== Usefulness of P and S waves in locating an event ==

In the case of local or nearby earthquakes, the difference in the arrival times of the P and S waves can be used to determine the distance to the event. In the case of earthquakes that have occurred at global distances, three or more geographically diverse observing stations (using a common clock) recording P wave arrivals permits the computation of a unique time and location on the planet for the event. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of P wave arrivals are used to calculate hypocenters. The misfit generated by a hypocenter calculation is known as &quot;the residual&quot;. Residuals of 0.5 second or less are typical for distant events, residuals of 0.1–0.2 s typical for local events, meaning most reported P arrivals fit the computed hypocenter that well. Typically a location program will start by assuming the event occurred at a depth of about 33 km; then it minimizes the residual by adjusting depth. Most events occur at depths shallower than about 40 km, but some occur as deep as 700 km.

A quick way to determine the distance from a location to the origin of a seismic wave less than 200 km away is to take the difference in arrival time of the P wave and the S wave in seconds and multiply by 8 kilometers per second. Modern seismic arrays use more complicated earthquake location techniques.

At teleseismic distances, the first arriving P waves have necessarily travelled deep into the mantle, and perhaps have even refracted into the outer core of the planet, before travelling back up to the Earth&#x27;s surface where the seismographic stations are located. The waves travel more quickly than if they had traveled in a straight line from the earthquake. This is due to the appreciably increased velocities within the planet, and is termed Huygens&#x27; Principle. Density in the planet increases with depth, which would slow the waves, but the modulus of the rock increases much more, so deeper means faster. Therefore, a longer route can take a shorter time.

The travel time must be calculated very accurately in order to compute a precise hypocenter. Since P waves move at many kilometers per second, being off on travel-time calculation by even a half second can mean an error of many kilometers in terms of distance. In practice, P arrivals from many stations are used and the errors cancel out, so the computed epicenter is likely to be quite accurate, on the order of 10–50 km or so around the world. Dense arrays of nearby sensors such as those that exist in California can provide accuracy of roughly a kilometer, and much greater accuracy is possible when timing is measured directly by cross-correlation of seismogram waveforms.

<doc id="89834" wikidata="Q66940" url="?curid=89834" title="Karl Koch (hacker)">
<text>Karl Werner Lothar Koch (July 22, 1965 – c. May 23, 1989) was a German hacker in the 1980s, who called himself &quot;hagbard&quot;, after Hagbard Celine. He was involved in a Cold War computer espionage incident.

==Biography==
Koch was born in Hanover. His mother died of cancer in 1976; his father had alcohol problems and in August 1984 also died of cancer. 

Koch was interested in astronomy as a teenager and was also involved in the state student&#x27;s council. In 1979 Karl&#x27;s father gave him the 1975 book, &quot;Illuminatus! – The Golden Apple&quot; by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, which had a strong influence to him. From his income as a member of the state students&#x27; council, he bought his first computer in 1982 and named it &quot;FUCKUP&quot; (&quot;First Universal Cybernetic-Kinetic Ultra-Micro Programmer&quot;) after The Illuminatus! Trilogy. In 1985 Koch and some other hackers founded the &quot;Computer-Stammtisch&quot; in a pub of the &quot;Hanover-Oststadt&quot;, which developed later into the Chaos Computer Club Hanover. During this time Koch began to use hard drugs. In February 1987 Koch broke off a vacation in Spain, because of this, and had himself admitted to a psychiatric clinic in Aachen for rehab treatments, where he stayed for three months.

==Hacking==
He worked with the hackers known as DOB (Dirk-Otto Brezinski), Pengo (Hans Heinrich Hübner), and Urmel (Markus Hess), and was involved in selling hacked information from United States military computers to the KGB. Clifford Stoll&#x27;s book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot; gives a first-person account of the hunt and eventual identification and arrest of Hess in March 1989. Pengo and Koch subsequently came forward and confessed to the authorities under the espionage amnesty, which protected them from being prosecuted.

==Death==
In May 1989 Koch left his workplace in his car to go for lunch; when he had not returned by late afternoon, his employer reported him as a missing person.

German police were alerted to a long abandoned car in a forest near Celle on June 1, 1989. The remains of Koch—at this point just bones—were discovered close by with a patch of scorched and burnt ground surrounding them and with his shoes missing. The scorched earth itself was controlled in a small circle around the corpse even though it had not rained in some time and the grass was perfectly dry. 

Despite his death being officially ruled a suicide, His death fueled conspiracy theories, with speculation ranging from suicide due to psychological struggles and drug addiction to retaliation by intelligence agencies. His death remains controversial, symbolizing both the dangers of hacking and the psychological toll of his lifestyle. Koch&#x27;s story inspired books, films, and enduring myths about hackers and conspiracies.
 With no suicide note having ever been found.

==Karl Koch in media==

===Books===

===Movies===
A German movie about his life, entitled &quot;23&quot;, was released in 1998. While the film was critically acclaimed, it has been harshly criticized as exploitative by real-life witnesses. A corrective to the film&#x27;s take is the documentation written by his friends.

In 1990, a documentary was released titled &quot;The KGB, The Computer and Me&quot;.

===Music===
*Koch was memorialized by Clock DVA at the opening of their music video for &quot;The Hacker&quot; and in the liner notes for &quot;The Hacker&quot; on the album &quot;Buried Dreams&quot; (1989).

<text>Janis Ian (born Janis Eddy Fink; April 7, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter who was most commercially successful in the 1960s and 1970s. Her signature songs are the 1966/67 hit &quot;Society&#x27;s Child (Baby I&#x27;ve Been Thinking)&quot; and the 1975 Top Ten single &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, from her seventh studio album &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, which in September 1975 reached No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Born in Farmingdale, New Jersey, Ian entered the American folk music scene while still a teenager in the mid-1960s. Most active musically in that decade and the 1970s, she has continued recording into the 21st century. She has won two Grammy Awards, the first in 1975 for &quot;At Seventeen&quot; and the second in 2013 for Best Spoken Word Album, for her autobiography, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;, with a total of ten nominations in eight different categories.

Ian is a columnist and science fiction author.

==Early life==
Born in Farmingdale, New Jersey, Ian was raised on a farm and attended East Orange High School in East Orange, New Jersey and the New York City High School of Music &amp; Art in Manhattan. Both sets of grandparents (from Poland, Ukraine, and Tashkent, Uzbekistan) lived in the New York-New Jersey area, having emigrated via England around 1918. Her parents, Victor, a music teacher, and Pearl, a college fundraiser, were Jewish-born liberal atheists who ran several summer camps in upstate New York.

As a child, Ian admired the work of folk musicians including Joan Baez and Odetta. Starting with piano lessons at the age of two (at her own insistence), Ian, by the time she entered her teens, was playing the organ, harmonica, French horn, and guitar. At the age of 12, she wrote her first song, &quot;Hair of Spun Gold&quot;, which was subsequently published in the folk publication &quot;Broadside&quot; and was later recorded for her eponymous debut album. In 1964, she legally changed her name to Janis Ian, taking her brother Eric&#x27;s middle name as her new surname.

==Music career==

At the age of 14, Ian wrote and recorded her first hit single, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child (Baby I&#x27;ve Been Thinking)&quot;, about an interracial romance forbidden by a girl&#x27;s mother and frowned upon by her peers and teachers. Produced by George &quot;Shadow&quot; Morton and released three times from 1965 to 1967, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; became a national hit upon its third release after Leonard Bernstein featured it in a late-April 1967 CBS TV special titled &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot;.

The song&#x27;s theme of interracial relationships was considered taboo by some radio stations, who withdrew or banned it from their playlists accordingly. In her 2008 autobiography &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;, Ian recalls receiving hate mail and death threats as a response to the song and mentions that a radio station in Atlanta that played it was burned down. In July 1967, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; reached No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single sold 600,000 copies and the album sold 350,000 copies.

At the age of 16, Ian met comedian Bill Cosby backstage at a Smothers Brothers show where she was promoting &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;. Since she was underage, she was accompanied by a chaperone while touring. After her set, Ian had been sleeping with her head on the lap of her chaperone (an older female family friend). According to Ian in a 2015 interview, she was told by her then manager that Cosby had interpreted their interaction as &quot;lesbian&quot; and as a result &quot;had made it his business&quot; to warn other television shows that Ian wasn&#x27;t &quot;suitable family entertainment&quot; and &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be on television&quot; because of her sexuality, thus attempting to blacklist her. Although Ian would later come out, she states that at the time of the encounter with Cosby she had only been kissed once, by a boy she had a crush on, in broad daylight at summer camp.

On her website Ian relates that although &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; was originally intended for Atlantic Records and the label paid for her recording session, Atlantic subsequently returned the master to her and quietly refused to release it. Ian relates that years later, Atlantic&#x27;s president at the time, Jerry Wexler, publicly apologized to her for this. The single and Ian&#x27;s 1967 debut album (which reached no. 29 on the charts) were finally released on Verve Forecast. In 2001, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which honors recordings considered timeless and important to music history. Her first four albums were released on a double CD entitled &quot;Society&#x27;s Child: The Verve Recordings&quot; in 1995.

&quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; stigmatized Ian as a one-hit wonder until her most successful US single, &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, was released in 1975. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; is a bittersweet commentary on adolescent cruelty, the illusion of popularity and teenage angst, from the perspective of a narrator looking back on her earlier experience. The song was a major hit as it charted at no. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, hit number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female, beating out Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, Judy Collins and Helen Reddy. Ian appeared as the second musical guest on the series premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 11, 1975, performing &quot;At Seventeen&quot; and &quot;In the Winter&quot;. The album &quot;Between the Lines&quot; was also a smash and reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s album chart. The album would be certified platinum for sales of over one million copies sold in the US. Another measure of her success is anecdotal: on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1977, Ian received 461 valentine cards, having indicated in the lyrics to &quot;At Seventeen&quot; that she never received one as a teenager.

&quot;Fly Too High&quot; (1979), produced by disco producer Giorgio Moroder, was Ian&#x27;s contribution to the soundtrack of the Jodie Foster film &quot;Foxes&quot; and was also featured on Ian&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Night Rains&quot;. It also became another international hit, reaching number one in many countries, including South Africa, Belgium, Australia, Israel and the Netherlands, and going gold or platinum in those countries and others. Another country where Ian has achieved a high level of popularity is Japan: Ian had two Top 10 singles on the Japanese Oricon charts, &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; in 1976 and &quot;You Are Love&quot; in 1980. Ian&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Aftertones&quot; also topped Oricon&#x27;s album chart in October 1976. &quot;You Are Love (Toujours Gai Mon Cher)&quot; is the theme song of Kinji Fukasaku&#x27;s 1980 movie &quot;Virus&quot;. Ian cut several other singles specifically for the Japanese market, including 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Last Great Place&quot;. In the US, Ian did not chart in the Top 40 on the pop charts after &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, though she had several songs reach the Adult Contemporary singles chart through 1980 (all failing to make the Top 20).

Ian started Rude Girl Records, Inc., and its publishing arm, Rude Girl Publishing, on January 2, 1992. Since then, RGR has steadily grown, with its ownership of more than twenty-five Janis Ian albums and DVDs overseas, as well as hundreds of unreleased recordings and videos, including unreleased songs, concerts, demos, and rehearsal tapes. The Rude Girl label oversees the production of Ian&#x27;s newer work, and in the case of older work, its re-mastering and the re-creation of the original artwork.

From 1982–92, Ian continued to write songs, often in collaboration with then songwriting partner Kye Fleming, some of which have been covered by Amy Grant, Bette Midler, Marti Jones and other artists. She released &quot;Breaking Silence&quot; in 1993 and came out as a lesbian. Other artists have recorded Ian&#x27;s compositions, including Roberta Flack, who had a hit in 1973 with Ian&#x27;s song &quot;Jesse&quot;, which peaked at #30 on the Hot 100 on October 27, 1973. Ian&#x27;s own version is included on her 1974 album &quot;Stars&quot; (the title song of which has also been oft-covered, including versions by Joan Baez, Shirley Bassey, Cher, Nina Simone and Barbara Cook). &quot;At Seventeen&quot; is Ian&#x27;s most covered composition with 50 versions by artists including Celine Dion, Miki Howard and Julia Fordham. Ian&#x27;s song &quot;In The Winter&quot; has also been covered many times by singers including Dusty Springfield and Sheena Easton. Richard Barone recorded Ian&#x27;s song &quot;Sweet Misery&quot; on his album &quot;Sorrows &amp; Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s&quot; in 2016. She continues to tour worldwide, though she stated that her 2022 North-American tour, which was cancelled when a laryngitis diagnosis became severe, would be her &quot;last full tour&quot;. In August 2018 Ian performed at the UK&#x27;s Cambridge Folk Festival.

==Criticism of the RIAA==
Ian is an outspoken critic of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which she sees as acting against the interests of musicians and consumers. Thus, she has released several of her songs for free download from her website. &quot;I&#x27;ve been surprised at how few people are willing to get annoyed with me over it,&quot; she laughs. &quot;There was a little backlash here and there. I was scheduled to appear on a panel somewhere and somebody from a record company said if I was there they would boycott it. But that&#x27;s been pretty much it. In general, the entire reaction has been favorable. I hear from a lot of people in my industry who don&#x27;t want to be quoted, but say &#x27;yeah, we&#x27;re aware of this and we&#x27;d like to see a change too.&#x27;&quot; Along with science fiction authors Eric Flint and Cory Doctorow, she has argued that their experience provides conclusive evidence that free downloads dramatically increased hard-copy sales, contrary to the claims of RIAA and NARAS.

==Writing and acting==
Ian writes science fiction. A long-time reader of the genre, she became involved in science fiction fandom in 2001 by attending the Millennium Philcon in Philadelphia. Her short stories have been published in anthologies and with Mike Resnick, she co-edited &quot;Stars: Original Stories Based on the Songs of Janis Ian&quot;, an anthology published in 2003 (). She continues to occasionally go to science fiction conventions. Ian performed at the 2009 Nebula Award Conference in Los Angeles, where she sang &quot;Welcome Home,&quot; a version of her song &quot;At Seventeen&quot; with the lyrics changed to talk about the acceptance she found by reading science fiction.

Ian was a regular columnist for the LGBT news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; and contributed to &quot;Performing Songwriter&quot; magazine from 1993 to 2006. On July 24, 2008, Ian released autobiography &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot; (published by Penguin Tarcher), which was positively received.. An accompanying double CD, &quot;The Autobiography Collection&quot;, has been released with many of Ian&#x27;s best loved songs.

Ian took acting lessons and script interpretation classes from Stella Adler in the early 1980s to help her feel more comfortable on stage, and she and Adler remained close friends until Adler&#x27;s death in 1992. In December 2015, Ian appeared in the series finale of HBO comedy series &quot;Getting On&quot; playing a patient who refused to stop singing.

==Personal life==
Ian&#x27;s mother, Pearl Yadoff Fink, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975. Because of this, Ian and her brother persuaded their mother to pursue her lifelong dream of going to college. Fink eventually enrolled in Goddard College&#x27;s adult education program and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree. After Fink&#x27;s death in 1997, Ian decided to auction off memorabilia to raise money to endow a scholarship at Goddard specifically for older continuing education students, which became the Pearl Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. At the end of each year, 90% or more of funds raised from sale of merchandise, donations from fans and contributions from Ian herself are disbursed to various educational institutions to fund scholarships. By 2020, it had endowed more than $1,250,000 in scholarship funds at four schools.

Ian married Portuguese filmmaker Tino Sargo in 1978 and the two divorced in 1983. Accusations of Sargo&#x27;s physical and emotional abuse were discussed in Ian&#x27;s autobiography. After moving to Nashville, she met Patricia Snyder in 1989. Ian came out as a lesbian in 1993 with the worldwide release of her album &quot;Breaking Silence&quot;. Snyder and Ian married in Toronto on August 27, 2003. Ian has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren with Snyder.

<text>École nationale des ponts et chaussées (; ; abbr. ENPC), also nicknamed Ponts (), formerly known as École des Ponts ParisTech (), is a grande école in the field of science, engineering and technology, of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris, a public research university. Founded in 1747 by Daniel-Charles Trudaine, it is one of the oldest and one of the most prestigious French &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;.

Historically, its primary mission has been to train engineering officials and civil engineers but the school now offers a wide-ranging education including computer science, applied mathematics, civil engineering, mechanics, finance, economics, innovation, urban studies, environment and transport engineering. École des Ponts is today largely international: 43% of its students obtain a double degree abroad, and 30% of an &quot;ingénieur&quot; cohort is foreign.

It is headquartered in Marne-la-Vallée (suburb of Paris), France, and is a founding member of ParisTech (Paris Institute of Technology) and of the Paris School of Economics. The school is under the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France. Since 15 July 2024, the school has been a constituent member of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris.

== History ==
=== 1747–1794: Origins ===
Following the creation of the Corps of Bridges and Roads in 1716, the King&#x27;s Council decided in 1747 to found a specific training course for the state&#x27;s engineers, as École royale des ponts et chaussées. In 1775, the school took its current name as École nationale des ponts et chaussées, by Daniel-Charles Trudaine, in a moment when the state decided to set up a progressive and efficient control of the building of roads, bridges and canals, and in the training of civil engineers.

The school&#x27;s first director, from 1747 until 1794, was Jean-Rodolphe Perronet, engineer, civil service administrator and a contributor to the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. Without lecturer, fifty students (among whom Lebon, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Pierre-Simon Girard, Riche de Prony, Méchain and Brémontier), initially taught themselves geometry, algebra, mechanics and hydraulics. Visits of building sites, cooperations with scientists and engineers and participation to the drawing of the map of the kingdom used to complete their training, which was usually four to twelve years long.

=== 1794–1848: Growth and industrialisation ===
During the First French Empire run by Napoleon I from 1804 to 1814, a number of members of the Corps of Bridges and Roads (including Barré de Saint-Venant, Belgrand, Biot, Cauchy, Coriolis, Dupuit, Fresnel, Gay-Lussac, Navier, Vicat) took part in the reconstruction of the French road network that had not been maintained during the Revolution, and in large infrastructural developments, notably hydraulic projects. Under the orders of the emperor, French scientist Gaspard Riche de Prony, second director of the school from 1798 to 1839, adapts the education provided by the school in order to improve the training of future civil engineers, whose purpose is to rebuild the major infrastructures of the country: roads, bridges, but also administrative buildings, barracks and fortifications. Prony is now considered as a historical and influential figure of the school.
During the twenty years that followed the First Empire, the experience of the faculty and the alumni involved in the reconstruction strongly influenced its training methods and internal organisation. In 1831, the school opens its first laboratory, which aims at concentrating the talents and experiences of the country&#x27;s best civil engineers. The school also gradually becomes a place of reflection and debates for urban planning.

=== 1848–1945: The big works ===
As a new step in the evolution of the school, the decree of 1851 insists on the organisation of the courses, the writing of an annual schedule, the quality of the faculty, and the control of the students’ works. For the first time in its history, the school opens its doors to a larger public. At this time, in France, the remarkable development of transports, roads, bridges and canals is strongly influenced by engineers from the school (Becquerel, Bienvenüe, Caquot, Carnot, Colson, Coyne, Freyssinet, Résal, Séjourné), who deeply modernised the country by creating the large traffic networks, admired in several European countries.

=== 1945–1997: Modernisation ===
After the Second World War, the school focused on developing the link between economics and engineering. As civil engineering was requiring increasingly higher financial investments, the state needed engineers to be able to understand the economic situation of post-war Europe. From then on, the program of the school had three different aspects: scientific and technic, social, and economic.
Gradually, the number of admitted students increased in order to provide both the Corps of Bridges and Roads and the private sector highly trained young engineers. At the time, technical progress and considerable development of sciences and techniques used in building, urbanism and the protection of the environment imposed a change of strategy in the training programme. More specialisations were progressively created and the overall programme was adapted to national issues.

== Academics ==

École des Ponts is a &quot;Grande école&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although they are more expensive than public universities in France, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Many of the top ranked institutes and business schools in Europe are members of the &quot;(CGE)&quot;, as is École des Ponts; out of the 250 business schools in France, only 39 are &quot;CGE&quot; members.

École des Ponts offers high-level programmes in an extensive range of fields, with traditional competences in mathematics, computer science, civil engineering, mechanics, economics, finance, environment, transport, town &amp; regional planning, logistics and innovation. It is among the schools called &quot;généralistes&quot;, which means that students receive a broad, management-oriented and non-specialised education. The school also offers specialized/research masters and PhDs, and a design school, with programmes in innovation and startup creation. Degrees from École des Ponts are accredited by the and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (). Its Business School is further accredited by the elite international business school accrediting organizations and it holds double accreditation: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and Association of MBAs (AMBA)

Times Higher Education ranked these &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; in the top 10 worldwide (small universities: fewer than 5,000 students):


=== The &quot;Ingénieur&quot; programme ===

==== Curriculum ====

This undergraduate-graduate engineering programme is the original and main programme offered by the school. It is quite different from typical university or college studies and specific to the French system of &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. The &quot;Ingénieur&quot; degree of École des Ponts – the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur&quot; – is equivalent to a Master of Science (including a Bachelor of Science).

==== Admissions ====

Admissions for engineering students is mostly done after &quot;scientific preparatory classes&quot; (MP, PSI, PC) through the highly selective &quot;Mines-Ponts&quot; competitive entrance exams. Some places are open each year to French and foreign university students as well as BCPST (biology) scientific preparatory classes

École des Ponts recruits among the top 4% of the students in &quot;preparatory classes&quot;.

The laboratories of the school host many PhD students (and classical CIFRE theses) wishing to engage in research, the financing of which is done mainly through corporate chairs. There were 40 PhDs awarded in 2021 to students working in the laboratories of the School and the Ecole des Ponts was welcoming, in 2021–2022, about 183 PhD students in its laboratories.
The &quot;Ingénieur&quot; programme students have the opportunity to complete their training with a PhD in the school&#x27;s laboratories, or to prepare for it by pursuing a research Masters in these laboratories during their third year.

=== École des Ponts Business School ===

École des Ponts Business School is the business school of École des Ponts. It offers five types of programmes: Undergraduate Programs in International Management, The fully accredited Solvay-Ponts full-time MBA, the Executive MBA, the recently launched Executive DBA and the Custom &amp; Corporate Programme.

Students from École des Ponts benefit from the proximity with the business school in two ways: they can, in parallel to their engineering studies, take the business school&#x27;s undergraduate &quot;course in International Management (cIM)&quot; and have the opportunity to pursue its MBA in their last year of study.
In coopération with the &quot;École nationale de l&#x27;aviation civile&quot;, the school offers an Executive MBA in aviation in Morocco and China.

The focus of the newly launched Executive-DBA is practical, rather than theoretical. The profile of applicants is therefore different than most PhD programs.

=== Paris at École des Ponts ===

As part of the Ministry of Education and Research IDEFI (Excellence Initiatives for Innovative Training) programme, the school has created the first French design school.

 Paris at École des Ponts offers courses, notably through the ME310 programme in partnership with Stanford University, with a strong entrepreneurial dimension.

=== Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests ===

The Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests is a technical &quot;Grand Corps&quot; of the French State (see Grands corps de l&#x27;Etat). People entering the Corps become officials and serve the French state.

=== Departments ===
Education for the &quot;Ingénieur&quot; programme is organised in the six following departments:
* Civil and Structural Engineering
* City, Environment, Transportation
* Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science
* Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
* Economics, Management, Finance
* Industrial Engineering

It is also possible to pursue exchange semesters within the framework of bilateral agreements (Berkeley, Georgia Tech, Imperial College or Erasmus exchanges), or research internships in the laboratories of the school&#x27;s academic partners.
In particular, the school has very close ties with Brazil, China and Spain. In the second year of the &quot;Ingénieur&quot; programme, a third of the cohort comes from partner institutions.

Every year, many students get a double-degree in an establishment approved by the school, including leading universities in the United-States (Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Princeton, Columbia), the United-Kingdom (London School of Economics, Imperial College, Oxford, Cambridge) and Asia (Tokyo University, NUS, HKU).

=== One-way double-degree agreements ===
Apart from exchange agreements with world high-level universities, École des Ponts offers every year to selected students from some universities of France&#x27;s partner countries to pursue their studies and earn the École des Ponts degree besides their original university&#x27;s degree. Universities with this form of partnership include the National Engineering School of Tunis from Tunisia, the École Hassania des travaux publics from Morocco and the Université Saint-Joseph de Beyrouth from Lebanon.

<text>The Latin Quarter of Paris (, ) is an urban university campus in the 5th and the 6th arrondissements of Paris. It is situated on the left bank of the Seine, around the Sorbonne.

Known for its student life, lively atmosphere, and bistros, the Latin Quarter is one of the oldest parts of the universities of Paris. It continues to be the heart of the universities and &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; that succeeded the University of Paris, such as:

* the Sorbonne University, with the Sorbonne, and the Jussieu campus;
* the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, with the Panthéon Centre and its Law School, and which also has teaching programs within the Sorbonne;
* the Paris Cité University, with the &quot;École de Médecine&quot; building and the Cordeliers campus;
* the PSL University, with the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;, the &quot;Collège de France&quot;, the &quot;École des Mines&quot;, the &quot;École Nationale Supérieure de Chimie&quot;, or the ENSAD.
* and the Panthéon-Assas University, with its Assas Law School within the Panthéon Centre.

But also of:

*the lycée Henri-IV, the lycée Louis-le-Grand and the lycée Saint-Louis, known as &quot;les trois lycées de la montagne&quot;;
*Sciences Po;
*and the Schola Cantorum.

Other &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; such as the have relocated in recent times to more spacious settings, notably in Paris-Saclay.

The area gets its name from the Latin language, which was widely spoken in and around the University during the Middle Ages, after the twelfth century philosopher Pierre Abélard and his students took up residence there.

Additionally, the Latin Quarter has the honor of being the setting of Puccini&#x27;s tragic opera, La Bohème.

== Buildings and university &quot;centres&quot; ==
The Latin Quarter is home to many academic institutions, including Sorbonne University and the Panthéon-Sorbonne University in the Sorbonne historical building. It is also home to the largest university libraries in Paris, such as the Sainte-Geneviève Library, the Sorbonne Library, the Sainte-Barbe Library, the Assas Law Library and the Cujas Law Library. University administrative buildings are also located there, such as the presidency of Sorbonne University in the Cordeliers Convent or the headquarters of Paris Cité University in the former &quot;École de Médecine&quot;.

<text>The 5th arrondissement of Paris (&quot;Ve arrondissement&quot;) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as &quot;le cinquième&quot;.

The arrondissement, also known as Panthéon, is situated on the Rive Gauche of the River Seine. It is one of the capital&#x27;s central arrondissements. The arrondissement is notable for being the location of the Latin Quarter, a district dominated by universities, colleges, and prestigious high schools since the 12th century when the University of Paris was created. It is also home to the National Museum of Natural History and Jardin des plantes in its eastern part.

The 5th arrondissement is also one of the oldest districts of the city, dating back to ancient times. Traces of the area&#x27;s past survive in such sites as the Arènes de Lutèce, a Roman amphitheatre, as well as the Thermes de Cluny, a Roman &quot;thermae&quot;.

==Geography==
The 5th arrondissement covers some 2.541 km2 (0.981 sq. miles, or 628 acres) in central Paris.

==Demography==
The population of the arrondissement peaked in 1911 when the population density reached almost 50,000 inhabitants per km2. In 2009, the population was 61,531, while 48,909 worked in the arrondissement.

===Historical population===
===Immigration===
==History==

The Ve arrondissement is the oldest arrondissement in Paris, and was first built by the Romans.

The construction of the Roman town &quot;Lutetia&quot; dates back to the 1st century BC, which was built after the conquest of the Gaulish site, situated on the île de la Cité by the Romans.

Saint-Hilaire is a ruined 12th-century church in Paris, active until the French Revolution.

==Government and business offices==
The Ministry of Higher Education and Research has its head office in the arrondissement.

 (ソニーコンピュータサイエンス研究所) Paris is located in the arrondissement, and the Bureau d&#x27;Enquêtes sur les Événements de Mer (BEAmer) at one time had its head office there.

<text>Sociolinguistics is the descriptive study of the interaction between society, including cultural norms, expectations, and context and language and the ways it is used. It can overlap with the sociology of language, which focuses on the effect of language on society. Sociolinguistics influences, and is influenced by pragmatics, and is closely related to linguistic anthropology.

Sociolinguistics&#x27; historical interrelation with anthropology can be observed in studies of how language varieties differ between groups separated by social variables (e.g., ethnicity, religion, status, gender, level of education, age, etc.) and/or geographical barriers (a mountain range, a desert, a river, etc.). Such studies also examine how such differences in usage and differences in beliefs about usage produce and reflect social or socioeconomic classes. As the usage of a language varies from place to place, language usage also varies among social classes, and some sociolinguists study these &quot;sociolects.&quot;

Studies in the field of sociolinguistics use a variety of research methods including ethnography/participant observation, analysis of audio or video recordings of real life encounters or interviews with members of a population of interest. Some sociolinguists assess the realization of social and linguistic variables in the resulting speech corpus. Other research methods in sociolinguistics include matched-guise tests (in which listeners share their evaluations of linguistic features they hear), dialect surveys, and analysis of preexisting corpora.

== Sociolinguistics in history ==
=== Beginnings ===
The social aspects of language were in the modern sense first studied by Indian and Japanese linguists in the 1930s, and also by Louis Gauchat in Switzerland in the early 1900s, but none received much attention in the West until much later. The study of the social motivation of language change, on the other hand, has its foundation in the wave model of the late 19th century. The first attested use of the term &quot;sociolinguistics&quot; was by Thomas Callan Hodson in the title of his 1939 article &quot;Sociolinguistics in India&quot; published in &quot;Man in India&quot;.

Dialectology is an old field, and in the early 20th century, dialectologists such as Hans Kurath and Raven I. McDavid Jr. initiated large scale surveys of dialect regions in the U.S.

=== Western contributions ===
The study of sociolinguistics in the West was pioneered by linguists such as Charles A. Ferguson or William Labov in the US and Basil Bernstein in the UK. In the 1960s, William Stewart and Heinz Kloss introduced the basic concepts for the sociolinguistic theory of pluricentric languages, which describes how standard language varieties differ between nations, e.g. regional varieties of English versus pluricentric &quot;English&quot;; regional standards of German versus pluricentric &quot;German&quot;; Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian versus pluricentric &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot;. Dell Hymes, one of the founders of linguistic anthropology, is credited with developing an ethnography-based sociolinguistics and is the founder of the journal &quot;Language in Society&quot;. His focus on ethnography and communicative competence contributed to his development of the SPEAKING method: an acronym for setting, participants, ends, act sequence, keys, instrumentalities, norms, and genres that is widely recognized as a tool to analyze speech events in their cultural context.

==Applications==
Sociolinguistics can be divided into subfields, which make use of different research methods, and have different goals. Dialectologists survey people through interviews, and compile maps. Ethnographers such as Dell Hymes and his students often live amongst the people they are studying. Conversation analysts such as Harvey Sacks and interactional sociolinguists such as John J. Gumperz record audio or video of natural encounters, and then analyze the tapes in detail. Sociolinguists tend to be aware of how the act of interviewing might affect the answers given.

Some sociolinguists study language on a national level among large populations to find out how language is used as a social institution. William Labov, a Harvard and Columbia University graduate, is often regarded as the founder of variationist sociolinguistics which focuses on the quantitative analysis of variation and change within languages, making sociolinguistics a scientific discipline.

For example, a sociolinguistics-based translation framework states that a linguistically appropriate translation cannot be wholly sufficient to achieve the communicative effect of the source language; the translation must also incorporate the social practices and cultural norms of the target language. To reveal social practices and cultural norms beyond lexical and syntactic levels, the framework includes empirical testing of the translation using methods such as cognitive interviewing with a sample population.

A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. Dialectology studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

== Sociolinguistic interview == 
The sociolinguistic interview is the foundational method of collecting data for sociolinguistic studies, allowing the researcher to collect large amounts of speech from speakers of the language or dialect being studied. The interview takes the form of a long, loosely-structured conversation between the researcher and the interview subject; the researcher&#x27;s primary goal is to elicit the vernacular style of speech: the register associated with everyday casual conversation. This goal is complicated by the observer&#x27;s paradox: the researcher is trying to elicit the style of speech that would be used if the interviewer were not present.

To that end, a variety of techniques may be used to reduce the subject&#x27;s attention to the formality and artificiality of the interview setting. For example, the researcher may attempt to elicit narratives of memorable events from the subject&#x27;s life, such as fights or near-death experiences; the subject&#x27;s emotional involvement in telling the story is thought to distract their attention from the formality of the context. Some researchers interview multiple subjects together to allow them to converse more casually with one other than they would with the interviewer alone. The researcher may then study the effects of style-shifting on language by comparing a subject&#x27;s speech style in more vernacular contexts, such as narratives of personal experience or conversation between subjects, with the more careful style produced when the subject is more attentive to the formal interview setting. The correlations of demographic features such as age, gender, and ethnicity with speech behavior may be studied by comparing the speech of different interview subjects.

== Fundamental concepts ==
While the study of sociolinguistics is very broad, there are a few fundamental concepts on which many sociolinguistic inquiries depend.

=== Speech community ===

Speech community is a concept in sociolinguistics that describes a distinct group of people who use language in a unique and mutually accepted way among themselves. This is sometimes referred to as a Sprechbund.

To be considered part of a speech community, one must have a communicative competence. That is, the speaker has the ability to use language in a way that is appropriate in the given situation. It is possible for a speaker to be communicatively competent in more than one language.

Demographic characteristics such as areas or locations have helped to create speech community boundaries in speech community concept. Those characteristics can assist exact descriptions of specific groups&#x27; communication patterns.

Speech communities can be members of a profession with a specialized jargon, distinct social groups like high school students or hip hop fans, or even tight-knit groups like families and friends. Members of speech communities will often develop slang or specialized jargon to serve the group&#x27;s special purposes and priorities. This is evident in the use of lingo within sports teams.

Community of Practice allows for sociolinguistics to examine the relationship between socialization, competence, and identity. Since identity is a very complex structure, studying language socialization is a means to examine the micro-interactional level of practical activity (everyday activities). The learning of a language is greatly influenced by family, but it is supported by the larger local surroundings, such as school, sports teams, or religion. Speech communities may exist within a larger community of practice.

=== High-prestige and low-prestige varieties ===
Crucial to sociolinguistic analysis is the concept of prestige; certain speech habits are assigned a positive or a negative value, which is then applied to the speaker. This can operate on many levels. It can be realized on the level of the individual sound/phoneme, as Labov discovered in investigating pronunciation of the post-vocalic /r/ in the Northeastern United States, or on the macro scale of language choice, as is realized in the various diglossia that exist throughout the world, with the one between Swiss German and High German being perhaps most well known. An important implication of the sociolinguistic theory is that speakers &#x27;choose&#x27; a variety when making a speech act, whether consciously or subconsciously.

The terms acrolectal (high) and basilectal (low) are also used to distinguish between a more standard dialect and a dialect of less prestige.

It is generally assumed that non-standard language is low-prestige language. However, in certain groups, such as traditional working-class neighborhoods, standard language may be considered undesirable in many contexts because the working-class dialect is generally considered a powerful in-group marker. Historically, humans tend to favor those who look and sound like them, and the use of nonstandard varieties (even exaggeratedly so) expresses neighborhood pride and group and class solidarity. The desirable social value associated with the use of non-standard language is known as covert prestige. There will thus be a considerable difference in use of non-standard varieties when going to the pub or having a neighborhood barbecue compared to going to the bank. One is a relaxed setting, likely with familiar people, and the other has a business aspect to it in which one feels the need to be more professional.

=== Social network ===
Understanding language in society means that one also has to understand the social networks in which language is embedded. A social network is another way of describing a particular speech community in terms of relations between individual members in a community. A network could be &quot;loose&quot; or &quot;tight&quot; depending on how members interact with each other. For instance, an office or factory may be considered a tight community because all members interact with each other. A large course with 100+ students would be a looser community because students may only interact with the instructor and maybe 1–2 other students. A &quot;multiplex&quot; community is one in which members have multiple relationships with each other. For instance, in some neighborhoods, members may live on the same street, work for the same employer and even intermarry.

The looseness or tightness of a social network may affect speech patterns adopted by a speaker. For instance, Sylvie Dubois and Barbara Horvath found that speakers in one Cajun Louisiana community were more likely to pronounce English &quot;th&quot; [θ] as [t] (or [ð] as [d]) if they participated in a relatively dense social network (i.e. had strong local ties and interacted with many other speakers in the community), and less likely if their networks were looser (i.e. fewer local ties).

A social network may apply to the macro level of a country or a city, but also to the interpersonal level of neighborhoods or a single family. Recently, social networks have been formed by the Internet through online chat rooms, Facebook groups, organizations, and online dating services.

==Differences according to class==
Sociolinguistics as a field distinct from dialectology was pioneered through the study of language variation in urban areas. Whereas dialectology studies the geographic distribution of language variation, sociolinguistics focuses on other sources of variation, among them class. Class and occupation are among the most important linguistic markers found in society. One of the fundamental findings of sociolinguistics, which has been hard to disprove, is that class and language variety are related. Members of the working class tend to speak less of what is deemed standard language, while the lower, middle, and upper middle class will, in turn, speak closer to the standard. However, the upper class, even members of the upper middle class, may often speak &#x27;less&#x27; standard than the middle class. This is because not only class but class aspirations, are important. One may speak differently or cover up an undesirable accent to appear to have a different social status and fit in better with either those around them, or how they wish to be perceived.

===Class aspiration===
Studies, such as those by William Labov in the 1960s, have shown that social aspirations influence speech patterns. This is also true of class aspirations. In the process of wishing to be associated with a certain class (usually the upper class and upper middle class) people who are moving in that direction socio-economically may adjust their speech patterns to sound like them. However, not being native upper-class speakers, they often hypercorrect, which involves overcorrecting their speech to the point of introducing new errors. The same is true for individuals moving down in socio-economic status.

In any contact situation, there is a power dynamic, be it a teacher-student or employee-customer situation. This power dynamic results in a hierarchical differentiation between languages.

===Social language codes===
Basil Bernstein, a well-known British sociolinguist, devised in his book, &quot;Elaborated and restricted codes: their social origins and some consequences&quot;, a method for categorizing language codes according to variable emphases on verbal and extraverbal communication. He claimed that factors like family orientation, social control, verbal feedback, and possibly social class contributed to the development of the two codes: elaborated and restricted.

====Restricted code====
According to Basil Bernstein, the restricted code exemplified the predominance of extraverbal communication, with an emphasis on interpersonal connection over individual expression. His theory places the code within environments that operate according to established social structures that predetermine the roles of their members in which the commonality of interests and intents from a shared local identity creates a predictability of discrete intent and therefore a simplification of verbal utterances. Such environments may include military, religious, and legal atmospheres; criminal and prison subcultures; long-term married relationships; and friendships between children.

The strong bonds between speakers often renders explicit verbal communication unnecessary and individual expression irrelevant. However, simplification is not a sign of a lack of intelligence or complexity within the code; rather, communication is performed more through extraverbal means (facial expression, touch, etc.) in order to affirm the speakers&#x27; bond. Bernstein notes the example of a young man asking a stranger to dance since there is an established manner of asking, yet communication is performed through physical graces and the exchange of glances.

As such, implied meaning plays a greater role in this code than in the elaborated code. Restricted code also operates to unify speakers and foster solidarity.

====Elaborated code====
Basil Bernstein defined &#x27;elaborated code&#x27; according to its emphasis on verbal communication over extraverbal. This code is typical in environments where a variety of social roles are available to the individual, to be chosen based upon disposition and temperament. Most of the time, speakers of elaborated code use a broader lexicon and demonstrate less syntactic predictability than speakers of restricted code. The lack of predetermined structure and solidarity requires explicit verbal communication of discrete intent by the individual to achieve educational and career success.

Bernstein notes with caution the association of the code with upper classes (while restricted code is associated with lower classes) since the abundance of available resources allows persons to choose their social roles. He warns, however, that studies associating the codes with separate social classes used small samples and were subject to significant variation.

He also asserts that elaborated code originates from differences in social context, rather than intellectual advantages. As such, elaborated code differs from restricted code according to the context-based emphasis on individual advancement over assertion of social/community ties.

====The codes and child development====
Bernstein explains language development according to the two codes in light of their fundamentally different values. For instance, a child exposed solely to restricted code learns extraverbal communication over verbal, and therefore may have a less extensive vocabulary than a child raised with exposure to both codes. While there is no inherent lack of value to restricted code, a child without exposure to elaborated code may encounter difficulties upon entering formal education, in which standard, clear verbal communication and comprehension is necessary for learning and effective interaction both with instructors and other students from differing backgrounds. As such, it may be beneficial for children who have been exposed solely to restricted code to enter pre-school training in elaborated code in order to acquire a manner of speaking that is considered appropriate and widely comprehensible within the education environment.

Additionally, Bernstein notes several studies in language development according to social class. In 1963, the Committee for Higher Education conducted a study on verbal IQ that showed a deterioration in individuals from lower working classes ages 8–11 and 11–15 years in comparison to those from middle classes (having been exposed to both restricted and elaborated codes). Additionally, studies by Bernstein, Venables, and Ravenette, as well as a 1958 Education Council report, show a relative lack of success on verbal tasks in comparison to extraverbal in children from lower working classes (having been exposed solely to restricted code).

===== Contradictions =====
The idea of these social language codes from Bernstein contrast with famous linguist Noam Chomsky&#x27;s ideas. Chomsky, deemed the &quot;father of modern linguistics&quot;, argues that there is a universal grammar, meaning that humans are born with an innate capacity for linguistic skills like sentence-building. This theory has been criticized by several scholars of linguistic backgrounds because of the lack of proven evolutionary feasibility and the fact that different languages do not have universal characteristics.

== Sociolinguistic variation ==
The study of language variation is concerned with social constraints determining language in its contextual environment. The variations will determine some of the aspects of language like the sound, grammar, and tone in which people speak, and even non-verbal cues. Code-switching is the term given to the use of different varieties of language depending on the social situation. This is commonly used among the African-American population in the United States. There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population as well such as age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress. The use of slang can be a variation based on age. Younger people are more likely to recognize and use today&#x27;s slang while older generations may not recognize new slang, but might use slang from when they were younger.

Variation may also be associated with gender. Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men). Other variations in speech patterns of men and women include differences in pitch, tone, speech fillers, interruptions, use of euphemisms, etc.

Variation in language can also come from ethnicity, economic status, level of education, etc.

<text>Louise Arbour, (born February 10, 1947) is a Canadian lawyer, prosecutor and jurist.

Arbour was the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal for Ontario and a former Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. From 2009 until 2014, she served as President and CEO of the International Crisis Group. She made history with the indictment of a sitting head of state, Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević, as well as the first prosecution of sexual assault as a crime against humanity. From March 2017 to December 2018 she was the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration. She is currently in private practice in Montreal.

==Early life and education==
Louise Arbour was born in Montreal, Quebec to Bernard and Rose (née Ravary) Arbour, the owners of a hotel chain. She attended convent school, during which time her parents divorced. As editor of the school magazine, she earned a reputation for irreverence.

In 1967, she graduated from Collège Regina Assumpta, and proceeded to the Université de Montréal where she completed an LL.B. with distinction in 1970. She was a law clerk for Justice Louis-Philippe Pigeon of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1971–1972 while completing graduate studies at the Faculty of Law (Civil Section) of the University of Ottawa. This is where she met her long time common-law partner Larry Taman, with whom she lived for 27 years. In a 2014 interview, Arbour named the move from Quebec to Ontario as the &quot;biggest hurdle [she] had to overcome to succeed in [her] career,&quot; as her entire education had been in French.

She was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1971 and the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1977.

==Personal life==
She has three adult children: Emilie, Patrick and Catherine. Her daughter Emilie Taman was an NDP candidate in the 2015 Canadian election in the electoral district of Ottawa—Vanier. Emilie also was a candidate for the NDP in the 2017 by-election and 2019 general election. She also has three grandchildren.

Arbour is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy and of the International Commission Against the Death Penalty.

==Legal career==
===Canada===
From 1972–73, Arbour was research officer for the Law Reform Commission of Canada. She then taught at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, first as a Lecturer (1974), then as Assistant Professor (1975), Associate Professor (1977–1987), and finally as Associate Professor and Associate Dean (1987). She was vice-president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association until her appointment to the Supreme Court of Ontario (High Court of Justice) in 1987 and to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1990. In 1995, Arbour was appointed as President of a Commission of Inquiry, under the Inquiries Act, for the purpose of investigating and reporting on events at the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario, following allegations by prisoners of abuse. The inquiry resulted in the publication of the Arbour Report.

===The Hague===
In 1996, at Richard Goldstone&#x27;s recommendation, Arbour was appointed as his replacement as Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, and of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. She indicted then-Serbian President Slobodan Milošević for war crimes, the first time a serving head of State was called to account before an international court.

===Supreme Court of Canada===
In 1999, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed Arbour to the Supreme Court of Canada on May 26, just one day before the publication of the indictment of Milosevic by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).

In 2004, Arbour retired from the Supreme Court of Canada, having served for just under five years.

== Career after law ==

=== United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights ===
After leaving the Supreme Court of Canada, Arbour became the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights. She criticized a number of countries for their human rights records. In 2008, she stepped down after serving one four year term.

===Works and awards===
She has published works in the areas of criminal procedure and criminal law, in both French and English. At various times, she has served as an editor for the &quot;Criminal Reports&quot;, the &quot;Canadian Rights Reporter&quot;, and the &quot;Osgoode Hall Law Journal&quot;.

In 2005, Arbour was awarded the Thomas J. Dodd Prize in International Justice and Human Rights, along with Justice Richard Goldstone, in recognition of her work on the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. She was the subject of a 2005 fact-based Canadian-German made-for-television movie, &quot;&quot;, which follows her quest to indict Bosnian Serb war criminals. Arbour was played by Canadian actress Wendy Crewson. In 2016, she was awarded the prestigious Tang Prize Award in rule of law for her enduring contributions to international criminal justice and the protection of human rights, and to promoting peace, justice and security at home and abroad, and to working within the law to expand the frontiers of freedom for all.

She was made a Companion to the Order of Canada in 2007 &quot;for her contributions to the Canadian justice system and for her dedication to the advancement of human rights throughout the world&quot;. She was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2009.

She was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour in 2011. She has been awarded numerous honorary degrees, including Doctor of Civil Laws from the University of Western Ontario in June 2000, Doctor of Humane Letters from Mount Saint Vincent University in May 2001, and Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of British Columbia in November 2001, the University of Waterloo in October 2006, in June 2009 from the University of Alberta and University of Guelph, and from Simon Fraser University in October 2009.

On March 9, 2017, Arbour was appointed by the U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, to be his Special Representative for International Migration. Her chief of staff was Jonathan Prentice.

In April 2021, Arbour was appointed to lead an independent review of the military’s handling of sexual assault, harassment and other misconduct, by Canadian Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan. In May 2022, she delivered her report to Canadian Minister of National Defence Anita Anand.

She is currently a member of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute&#x27;s International Council.

In January 2023, Arbour was awarded the 2023 Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor Justice Prize from Arizona State University, a lifetime achievement award for human rights work as well as upholding the rule of law and judicial independence.

<text>The iPod is a discontinued series of portable media players and multi-purpose mobile devices that were designed and marketed by Apple Inc. from 2001 to 2022. The first version was released on November 10, 2001, about months after the Macintosh version of iTunes was released. Apple sold an estimated 450 million iPod products as of 2022. Apple discontinued the iPod product line on May 10, 2022. At over 20 years, the iPod brand is the longest-running to be discontinued by Apple.

Some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage devices, like other digital music players. Prior to macOS 10.15, Apple&#x27;s iTunes software (and other alternative software) could be used to transfer music, photos, videos, games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and calendars to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad, which was separated into apps named &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Videos&quot; on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate Music and Videos apps are standardized across all iOS-powered products. While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as separate products. During the middle of 2010, iPhone sales overtook those of the iPod.

== History ==
Portable MP3 players had existed since the mid-1990s; however, Apple found existing digital music players &quot;big and clunky or small and useless&quot; with user interfaces that were &quot;unbelievably awful&quot;. They also identified weaknesses in existing models&#x27; attempt to negotiate the trade-off between capacity and portability: flash memory-based players held too few songs, while the hard drive based models were too big and heavy. To address these deficits, the company decided to develop its own MP3 player.

At Apple CEO Steve Jobs’ direction, hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein recruited Tony Fadell, a former employee of General Magic and Philips, who had a business idea to invent a better MP3 player and build a complementary music sales store. Fadell had previously developed the Philips Velo and Nino PDA before starting a company called Fuse Systems to build the new MP3 player, but RealNetworks, Sony and Philips had already passed on the project. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba hard disk drive while meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, ultimately purchasing the rights to it for Apple. Rubinstein had also already made substantial progress on development of other key hardware elements, including the device&#x27;s screen and battery.

Fadell found support for his project with Apple Computer and was hired by Apple in 2001 as an independent contractor to work on the iPod project, then code-named project P-68. Because most of Apple&#x27;s engineering manpower and resources were already dedicated to the iMac line, Fadell hired engineers from his startup company, Fuse, and veteran engineers from General Magic and Philips to build the core iPod development team.

Time constraints forced Fadell to develop various components of the iPod outside Apple. Fadell partnered with a company called PortalPlayer to design software for the device; this work eventually took shape as the iPod OS. Within eight months, Tony Fadell&#x27;s team and PortalPlayer had completed a prototype. The power supply was then designed by Michael Dhuey, while the display was designed in-house by Apple design engineer Jonathan Ive. The original iPod&#x27;s physical appearance was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel-based user interface drew on Bang &amp; Olufsen&#x27;s BeoCom 6000 telephone. Apple CEO Steve Jobs set an exacting standard for the device&#x27;s physical design; one anecdote relates an occasion on which Jobs dropped a prototype into an aquarium in front of engineers to demonstrate from bubbles leaving its housing that the current design contained unused internal space.

Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface (as well as Unicode, memory management, and event processing) under Jobs&#x27; direct supervision.

The name &quot;iPod&quot; was proposed by Vinnie Chieco, a freelance copywriter, who (with others) was contracted by Apple to determine how to introduce the new player to the public. After Chieco saw a prototype, he was reminded of the phrase &quot;Open the pod bay doors, Hal&quot; from the classic sci-fi film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, referring to the white EVA Pods of the Discovery One spaceship. Chieco&#x27;s proposal drew an analogy between the relationship of the spaceship to the smaller independent pods and that of a personal computer to its companion music player.

The product (which &quot;Fortune&quot; called &quot;Apple&#x27;s 21st-Century Walkman&quot;) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put &quot;1,000 songs in your pocket.&quot;

Apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use. Joseph N. Grasso of New Jersey had originally listed an &quot;iPod&quot; trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in July 2000 for Internet kiosks. The first iPod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in New Jersey in March 1998, and commercial use began in January 2000, but the venture had apparently been discontinued by 2001. The trademark was registered by the USPTO in November 2003, and Grasso assigned it to Apple Computer, Inc. in 2005. Separately, the earliest recorded use in commerce of an &quot;iPod&quot; trademark was in 1991 by Chrysalis Corp. of Sturgis, Michigan, styled &quot;&quot;i&quot;POD&quot;, for office furniture.

As development of the iPod progressed, Apple continued to refine the software&#x27;s look and feel, rewriting much of the code. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple&#x27;s corporate font, Myriad. Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock.

On January 8, 2004, Hewlett-Packard (HP) announced that they would sell HP-branded iPods under a license agreement from Apple. Several new retail channels were used—including Walmart—and these iPods eventually made up 5% of all iPod sales. In July 2005, HP stopped selling iPods due to unfavorable terms and conditions imposed by Apple.

In 2006, Apple partnered with Irish rock band U2 to present a special edition of the 5th-generation iPod. Like its predecessor, this iPod has the signatures of the four members of the band engraved on its back, but this one was the first time the company changed the color of the stainless steel back from a silver chrome to black. This iPod was only available with 30 GB of storage capacity. The special edition entitled purchasers to an exclusive video with 33 minutes of interviews and performance by U2, downloadable from the iTunes Store.

In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half, displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right.

In mid-2015, several new color schemes for all of the current iPod models were spotted in the iTunes 12.2 update. Belgian website Belgium iPhone originally found the images after plugging in an iPod for the first time, and subsequent photos were discovered by Pierre Dandumont before being leaked.

On July 27, 2017, Apple removed the iPod Nano and Shuffle from its stores, marking the end of Apple&#x27;s production of standalone music players. On May 10, 2022, Apple discontinued the iPod Touch, the last remaining product in the iPod line. iOS 15 was the last iOS release the 7th generation iPod touch received, as future versions from iOS 16 onward no longer support the device.

== Hardware ==
=== Audio ===
Audio tests showed that the third-generation iPod has a weak bass response. The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as when using an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.

For all iPods released in 2006 and earlier, some equalizer (EQ) sound settings can easily distort the bass sound, even on undemanding tracks. This occurs when using EQ settings such as R&amp;B, Rock, Acoustic, and Bass Booster, because the equalizer amplifies the digital audio level beyond the software&#x27;s limit, causing distortion (clipping) on bass instruments.

From the fifth-generation iPod on, Apple introduced a user-configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss. Users report that in the sixth-generation iPod, the maximum volume output level is limited to 100 dB in EU markets. Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in France for exceeding this legal limit. However, users who bought new sixth-generation iPods in late 2013 reported a new option that allowed them to disable the EU volume limit. Some have attributed this change to a software update that shipped with these devices. Older sixth-generation iPods, however, are unable to update to this software version.

=== Connectivity ===
Originally, a FireWire connection to the host computer was used to update songs or recharge the battery. The battery could also be charged with a power adapter that was included with the first four generations.

The third generation began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually, Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and charging port for the dock/cable.

The dock connector also allowed the iPod to connect to accessories, which often supplement the iPod&#x27;s music, video, and photo playback. Apple sold a few accessories, such as the now-discontinued iPod Hi-Fi, but most are manufactured by third parties such as Belkin and Griffin. Some peripherals use their own interface, while others use the iPod&#x27;s own screen. Because the dock connector is a proprietary interface, the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to Apple.

Apple introduced a new 8-pin dock connector, named Lightning, on September 12, 2012 with their announcement of the iPhone 5, the fifth-generation iPod Touch, and the seventh-generation iPod Nano, which all feature it. The new connector replaces the older 30-pin dock connector used by older iPods, iPhones, and iPads. Apple Lightning cables have pins on both sides of the plug so it can be inserted with either side facing up.

Bluetooth connectivity was added to the last model of the iPod Nano, and Wi-Fi to the iPod Touch.

=== Accessories ===
Many accessories have been made for the iPod line. A large number have been made by third-party companies, although many, such as the iPod Hi-Fi and iPod Socks, have been made by Apple. Some accessories added extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and composite video cables for TV connections. Other accessories offered unique features like the Nike+iPod pedometer and the iPod Camera Connector. Other notable accessories included external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones. Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.

BMW released the first iPod automobile interface, allowing drivers of newer BMW vehicles to control an iPod using either the built-in steering wheel controls or the radio head-unit buttons. Apple announced in 2005 that similar systems would be available for other vehicle brands, including Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Nissan, Toyota, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Acura, Audi, Honda, Renault, Infiniti and Volkswagen. Scion offered standard iPod connectivity on all their cars.

Some independent stereo manufacturers including JVC, Pioneer, Kenwood, Alpine, Sony, and Harman Kardon also had iPod-specific integration solutions. Alternative connection methods included adapter kits (that use the cassette deck or the CD changer port), audio input jacks, and FM transmitters such as the iTrip—although personal FM transmitters are illegal in some countries. Many car manufacturers have added audio input jacks as standard.

Beginning in mid-2007, four major airlines, United, Continental, Delta, and Emirates, reached agreements to install iPod seat connections. The free service allowed passengers to power and charge an iPod, and view video and music libraries on individual seat-back displays. Originally KLM and Air France were reported to be part of the deal with Apple, but they later released statements explaining that they were only contemplating the possibility of incorporating such systems.

== Software ==
The iPod line can play several audio file formats including MP3, AAC/M4A, Protected AAC, AIFF, WAV, Audible audiobook, and Apple Lossless. The iPod Photo introduced the ability to display JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and PNG image file formats. Fifth- and sixth-generation iPod Classic models, as well as third-generation iPod Nano models, can also play MPEG-4 (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC) and QuickTime video formats, with restrictions on video dimensions, encoding techniques and data rates. Originally, iPod software only worked with Classic Mac OS and macOS; iPod software for Microsoft Windows was launched with the second-generation model. Unlike most other media players, Apple does not support Microsoft&#x27;s WMA audio format—but a converter for WMA files without digital rights management (DRM) is provided with the Windows version of iTunes. MIDI files also cannot be played, but can be converted to audio files using the &quot;Advanced&quot; menu in iTunes. Alternative open-source audio formats, such as Ogg Vorbis and FLAC, are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an iPod (e.g., Rockbox).

During installation, an iPod is associated with one host computer. Each time an iPod connects to its host computer, iTunes can synchronize entire music libraries or music playlists either automatically or manually. Song ratings can be set on an iPod and synchronized later to the iTunes library, and vice versa. A user can access, play, and add music on a second computer if an iPod is set to manual and not automatic sync, but anything added or edited will be reversed upon connecting and syncing with the main computer and its library. If a user wishes to automatically sync music with another computer, an iPod&#x27;s library will be entirely wiped and replaced with the other computer&#x27;s library.

=== Interface ===

iPods with color displays use anti-aliased graphics and text, with sliding animations. All iPods (except the 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle, the 6th &amp; 7th generation iPod Nano, and iPod Touch) have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons integrated into the click wheel – an innovation that gives an uncluttered, minimalist interface. The buttons perform basic functions such as menu, play, pause, next track, and previous track. Other operations, such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume, are performed by using the click wheel in a rotational manner. The 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle does not have any controls on the actual player; instead, it has a small control on the earphone cable, with volume-up and -down buttons and a single button for play and pause, next track, etc. The iPod Touch has no click-wheel; instead, it uses a touch screen along with a home button, sleep/wake button, and (on the second and third generations of the iPod Touch) volume-up and -down buttons. The user interface for the iPod Touch is identical to that of the iPhone. Differences include the lack of a phone application and the lack of a SIM card to connect to cellular data. Both devices use iOS. 
=== iTunes Store ===

The iTunes Store (introduced April 28, 2003) is an online media store run by Apple and accessed through iTunes. The store became the market leader soon after its launch and Apple announced the sale of videos through the store on October 12, 2005. Full-length movies became available on September 12, 2006.

At the time the store was introduced, purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption, based on the FairPlay DRM system. Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files. Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then re-importing would create music files without the DRM. The DRM could also be removed using third-party software. However, in a deal with Apple, EMI began selling DRM-free, higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores, in a category called &quot;iTunes Plus.&quot; While individual songs were made available at a cost of , 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song, entire albums were available for the same price, , as DRM encoded albums. On October 17, 2007, Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to per song, the same as DRM encoded tracks. On January 6, 2009, Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80% of the music catalog and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009.

iPods cannot play music files from competing music stores that use rival-DRM technologies like Microsoft&#x27;s protected WMA or RealNetworks&#x27; Helix DRM. Example stores include Napster and MSN Music. RealNetworks claims that Apple is creating problems for itself by using FairPlay to lock users into using the iTunes Store. Steve Jobs stated that Apple makes little profit from song sales, although Apple uses the store to promote iPod sales. However, iPods can also play music files from online stores that do not use DRM, such as eMusic or Amie Street.

Universal Music Group decided not to renew their contract with the iTunes Store on July 3, 2007. Universal will now supply iTunes in an &#x27;at will&#x27; capacity.

Apple debuted the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store on September 5, 2007, in its Media Event entitled &quot;The Beat Goes On...&quot;. This service allows users to access the Music Store from either an iPhone or an iPod Touch and download songs directly to the device that can be synced to the user&#x27;s iTunes Library over a WiFi connection, or, in the case of an iPhone, the cellular network.

=== Games ===
Video games are playable on various versions of iPods. The original iPod had the game &quot;Brick&quot; (originally invented by Apple&#x27;s co-founder Steve Wozniak) included as an easter egg hidden feature; later firmware versions added it as a menu option. Later revisions of the iPod added three more games: &quot;Parachute&quot;, &quot;Solitaire&quot;, and &quot;Music Quiz&quot;.

In September 2006, the iTunes Store began to offer additional games for purchase with the launch of iTunes 7, compatible with the fifth generation iPod with iPod software 1.2 or later. Those games were: &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, &quot;Cubis 2&quot;, &quot;Mahjong&quot;, &quot;Mini Golf&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;Em&quot;, &quot;Vortex&quot;, &quot;Asphalt 4: Elite Racing&quot; and &quot;Zuma&quot;. Additional games have since been added. These games work on the 6th and 5th generation iPod Classic and the 5th and 4th generation iPod Nano.

With third parties like Namco, Square Enix, Electronic Arts, Sega, and Hudson Soft all making games for the iPod, Apple&#x27;s MP3 player has taken steps towards entering the video game handheld console market. Even video game magazines like GamePro and EGM have reviewed and rated most of their games as of late.

The games are in the form of .ipg files, which are actually .zip archives in disguise. When unzipped, they reveal executable files along with common audio and image files, leading to the possibility of third party games. Apple has not publicly released a software development kit (SDK) for iPod-specific development. Apps produced with the iPhone SDK are compatible only with the iOS on the iPod Touch and iPhone, which cannot run click wheel-based games.
=== File storage and transfer ===
All iPods except for the iPod Touch can function in &quot;disk mode&quot; as mass storage devices to store data files but this has to be manually activated. If an iPod is formatted on a Mac OS computer, it uses the HFS+ file system format, which allows it to serve as a boot disk for a Mac computer. If it is formatted on Windows, the FAT32 format is used. With the release of the Windows-compatible iPod, the default file system used on the iPod line switched from HFS+ to FAT32, although it can be reformatted to either file system (excluding the iPod Shuffle which is strictly FAT32). Generally, if a new iPod (excluding the iPod Shuffle) is initially plugged into a computer running Windows, it will be formatted with FAT32, and if initially plugged into a Mac running Mac OS it will be formatted with HFS+.

Unlike many other MP3 players, simply copying audio or video files to the drive with a typical file management application will not allow an iPod to properly access them. The user must use software that has been specifically designed to transfer media files to iPods so that the files are playable and viewable. Usually &quot;iTunes&quot; is used to transfer media to an iPod, though several alternative third-party applications are available on a number of different platforms.

&quot;iTunes&quot; 7 and above can transfer purchased media of the iTunes Store from an iPod to a computer, provided that computer containing the DRM protected media is authorized to play it.

Media files are stored on an iPod in a hidden folder, along with a proprietary database file. The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling hidden files to be shown. The media files can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod. Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of media files from an iPod.

== Models and features ==
While the suffix &quot;Classic&quot; was not introduced until the sixth generation, it has been applied here retroactively to all non-suffixed iPods for clarity.
== Patent disputes ==
In 2005, Apple faced two lawsuits claiming patent infringement by the iPod line and its associated technologies: Advanced Audio Devices claimed the iPod line breached its patent on a &quot;music jukebox&quot;, while a Hong Kong-based IP portfolio company called Pat-rights filed a suit claiming that Apple&#x27;s FairPlay technology breached a patent issued to inventor Ho Keung Tse. The latter case also includes the online music stores of Sony, RealNetworks, Napster, and Musicmatch as defendants.

Apple&#x27;s application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent on &quot;rotational user inputs&quot;, as used on the iPod interface, received a third &quot;non-final rejection&quot; (NFR) in August 2005. Also in August 2005, Creative Technology, one of Apple&#x27;s main rivals in the MP3 player market, announced that it held a patent on part of the music selection interface used by the iPod line, which Creative Technology dubbed the &quot;Zen Patent&quot;, granted on August 9, 2005. On May 15, 2006, Creative filed another suit against Apple with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Creative also asked the United States International Trade Commission to investigate whether Apple was breaching U.S. trade laws by importing iPods into the United States.

On August 24, 2006, Apple and Creative announced a broad settlement to end their legal disputes. Apple will pay Creative US$100 million for a paid-up license, to use Creative&#x27;s awarded patent in all Apple products. As part of the agreement, Apple will recoup part of its payment, if Creative is successful in licensing the patent. Creative then announced its intention to produce iPod accessories by joining the &quot;Made for iPod&quot; program.

== Sales ==
Sales of iPods peaked in 2008, following rapid growth in the period of 2005 to 2007.

In January 2007, Apple reported record quarterly revenue of US$7.1 billion, of which 48% was made from iPod sales. On April 9, 2007, it was announced that Apple had sold its one-hundred millionth iPod, making it the best-selling digital music player of all time. Its second-quarter revenue of US$5.2 billion, of which 32% was made from iPod sales. Apple and several industry analysts suggest that iPod users are likely to purchase other Apple products such as Mac computers. 42% of Apple&#x27;s revenue for the First fiscal quarter of 2008 came from iPod sales (followed by 21% from notebook sales and 16% from desktop sales).

On October 21, 2008, Apple reported that only 14.21% of total revenue for fiscal quarter 4 of the year 2008 came from iPods. At the September 9, 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event, Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million. The continual decline of iPod sales since 2009 has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation, as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June 2009: &quot;We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.&quot; Since 2009, the company&#x27;s iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in 2013 a new model was not introduced onto the market.

, Apple reported that total number of iPods sold worldwide was 350 million.

=== Market share ===
Since October 2004, the iPod line has dominated digital music player sales in the United States, with over 90% of the market for hard drive-based players and over 70% of the market for all types of players. During the year from January 2004 to January 2005, the high rate of sales caused its U.S. market share to increase from 31% to 65%, and in July 2005, this market share was measured at 74%. In January 2007, according to Bloomberg Online, the iPod market share reached 72.7%. In the Japanese market, iPod market share was 36% in 2005; nonetheless, it was still a market leader in the country. In Europe, Apple also led the market (especially the UK); however, local brands such as Archos managed to outsell Apple in certain categories.

One of the reasons for the iPod&#x27;s early success, having been released three years after the very first digital audio player (namely the MPMan), was its seamless integration with the company&#x27;s iTunes software, and the ecosystem built around it such as the iTunes Music Store, as well as a competitive price. As a result, Apple achieved a dominance in the MP3 player market as Sony&#x27;s Walkman did with personal cassette players two decades earlier. The software similarity between computer and player made it easy to transfer music over and synchronize it, tasks that were considered difficult on pre-iPod MP3 players such as those from Rio and Creative.
Some of the iPod&#x27;s chief competitors during its pinnacle include Creative&#x27;s Zen, SanDisk&#x27;s Sansa, Sony&#x27;s Walkman, iriver, and Samsung&#x27;s Yepp. The iPod&#x27;s dominance was challenged numerous times: in 2004 Sony&#x27;s first hard disk Walkman was designed to take on the iPod, accompanied by its own music store Sony Connect; Microsoft initially attempted to compete using a software platform called Portable Media Center, and in later years designed the Zune line; the most vocal rival was Creative, whose CEO in November 2004 &quot;declared war&quot; on the iPod. Samsung declared that they would take the top spot from Apple by 2007, while SanDisk ran a specific anti-iPod marketing campaign called iDon&#x27;t. These competitors failed to make major dents, and Apple remained dominant in the fast-growing digital audio player market during the decade. Mobile phone manufacturers Nokia and Sony Ericsson also made &quot;music phones&quot; to rival iPod. 

A suggested factor of iPod&#x27;s popularity has been cited to be Apple&#x27;s popular iTunes Store catalog, playing a part in keeping Apple firmly market leader, while also helped by the mismanagement of others, such as Sony&#x27;s unpopular SonicStage software.

One notable exception where iPod was not faring well was in South Korea. As of 2005, Apple held a market share of less than 2%, compared to market leaders iriver, Samsung and Cowon.

As of 2011, iPod held a 70% market share in global MP3 players. Its closest competitor was noted to be the Sansa line from SanDisk.

== Industry impact ==
iPods often receive favorable reviews; scoring on looks, clean design, and ease of use. &quot;PC World&quot; wrote that iPod line has &quot;altered the landscape for portable audio players&quot;. 

The iPod has also been credited with accelerating shifts within the music industry. The iPod&#x27;s popularization of digital music storage allows users to abandon listening to entire albums and instead be able to choose specific singles which hastened the end of the album era in popular music.

== Criticism ==
=== Battery problems ===
The advertised battery life on most models is different from the real-world achievable life. For example, the fifth-generation iPod Classic was advertised as having up to 14 hours of music playback. However, an MP3.com report stated that this was virtually unachievable under real-life usage conditions, with a writer for the site getting, on average, less than 8 hours from an iPod. In 2003, class action lawsuits were brought against Apple complaining that the battery charges lasted for shorter lengths of time than stated and that the battery degraded over time. The lawsuits were settled by offering individuals with first- or second-generation iPods either store credit or a free battery replacement, and offering individuals with third-generation iPods an extended warranty that would allow them to get a replacement iPod if they experienced battery problems.

As an instance of planned obsolescence, iPod batteries are not designed to be removed or replaced by the user, although some users have been able to open the case themselves, usually following instructions from third-party vendors of iPod replacement batteries. Compounding the problem, Apple initially would not replace worn-out batteries. The official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement iPod, at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one. All lithium-ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use (guidelines are available for prolonging life-span) and this situation led to a market for third-party battery replacement kits.

Apple announced a battery replacement program on November 14, 2003, a week before a high publicity stunt and website by the Neistat Brothers. The initial cost was , and it was lowered to in 2005. One week later, Apple offered an extended iPod warranty for . For the iPod Nano, soldering tools are needed because the battery is soldered onto the main board. Fifth generation iPods have their battery attached to the backplate with adhesive.

The first generation iPod Nano may overheat and pose a health and safety risk. Affected iPod Nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006. This is due to a flawed battery used by Apple from a single battery manufacturer. Apple recommended that owners of affected iPod Nanos stop using them. Under an Apple product replacement program, affected Nanos were replaced with current generation Nanos free of charge.

=== Reliability and durability ===
iPods have been criticized for alleged short lifespan and fragile hard drives. A 2005 survey conducted on the MacInTouch website found that the iPod line had an average failure rate of 13.7% (although they note that comments from respondents indicate that &quot;the true iPod failure rate may be lower than it appears&quot;). It concluded that some models were more durable than others. In particular, failure rates for iPods employing hard drives were usually above 20% while those with flash memory had a failure rate below 10%. In late 2005, many users complained that the surface of the first-generation iPod Nano can become scratched easily, rendering the screen unusable. A class-action lawsuit was also filed. Apple initially considered the issue a minor defect, but later began shipping these iPods with protective sleeves.

=== Labor disputes ===
On June 11, 2006, the British tabloid &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; reported that iPods are mainly manufactured by workers who earn no more than US$50 per month and work 15-hour shifts. Apple investigated the case with independent auditors and found that, while some of the plant&#x27;s labor practices met Apple&#x27;s Code of Conduct, others did not: employees worked over 60 hours a week for 35% of the time and worked more than six consecutive days for 25% of the time.

Foxconn, Apple&#x27;s manufacturer, initially denied the abuses, but when an auditing team from Apple found that workers had been working longer hours than were allowed under Chinese law, they promised to prevent workers working more hours than the code allowed. Apple hired a workplace standards auditing company, Verité, and joined the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct Implementation Group to oversee the measures. On December 31, 2006, workers at the Foxconn factory in Longhua, Shenzhen formed a union affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese government-approved union umbrella organization.

In 2010, a number of workers committed suicide at a Foxconn operations in China. Apple, HP, and others stated that they were investigating the situation. Foxconn guards have been videotaped beating employees. Another employee killed himself in 2009 when an Apple prototype went missing, and claimed in messages to friends, that he had been beaten and interrogated.

As of 2006, the iPod was produced by about 14,000 workers in the U.S. and 27,000 overseas. Further, the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower-skilled U.S. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. One interpretation of this result is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically.

<text>Alcalá de Henares () is a Spanish city in the Community of Madrid. Straddling the Henares River, it is located to the northeast of the center of Madrid. , it has a population of 193,751, making it the region&#x27;s third-most populated municipality.

Predated by earlier settlements (&quot;oppida&quot;) on the left bank of the Henares, the city has its origins in the Complutum settlement founded in Roman times on the right bank (north) of the river, that became a bishopric seat in the 5th century. One of the several Muslim citadels in the Middle Mark of al-Andalus (hence the name &quot;Alcalá&quot;, a derivative of the Arabic term for citadel) was established on the left bank, while, after the Christian conquest culminated , the bulk of the urban nucleus returned to the right bank. For much of the late middle-ages and the early modern period before becoming part of the province of Madrid, Alcalá de Henares was a seigneurial estate of the archbishops of Toledo.

Its historical centre is one of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

The city has a long university tradition. Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros founded the Complutense University in Alcalá de Henares in the late 15th century. The city currently hosts the (refounded) University of Alcalá. It is the native city of Miguel de Cervantes.

Locally, it is generally known simply as , but (‘of the river Henares’) is appended when needed to differentiate it from a dozen Spanish cities sharing the name Alcalá (from the Arabic word , for fortification or citadel, typically a castle).

Its Latin name, , means &quot;confluence&quot;, where rivers&#x27; water (or rain water) flow into one place (i.e., a ).

==History==

The city boundaries have been inhabited since the Chalcolithic phase of the Bronze Age. Romans conquered the area in the 1st century BC, and built the town of &quot;Complutum&quot; near a previous Carpetanian settlement, Iplacea. With 10,000 inhabitants, it reached the status of &quot;municipium&quot; and had its own governing institutions. It played an important role, located on the Roman road connecting Emerita Augusta and Caesaraugusta.

After the downfall of the Roman Empire, under the Visigoths, it declined, although it also became a pilgrimage destination in remembrance of the Saints Justo and Pastor.

When the Moors invaded in 711, they conquered the Visigothic city and founded another site, building an , which means &quot;citadel&quot; in Arabic, on a nearby hill, today known as (Old Alcalá). On 3 May 1118, it was reconquered by the Archbishop of Toledo Bernard de Sedirac at behest of Castile.

Soon after, on 10 February 1129, Alfonso VII gave Alcalá to Raymond de Sauvetât, also Archbishop of Toledo, becoming an archiepiscopal property for centuries to come. Raymond granted the town an old &quot;fuero&quot; (charter) in 1135.

The Christians preferred the &quot;Burgo de Santiuste&quot; (&quot;Saint Just&#x27;s borough&quot;) on the original Roman site, and the Muslim one was abandoned.

Under Christian rule until the end of the Reconquista, the town had both a Jewish and a Moorish quarter and a renowned marketplace. Its central position allowed it to be a frequent residence of the Kings of Castile, when travelling south.

At some time in the 1480s, Christopher Columbus first met there the &quot;Reyes Católicos&quot;, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife Queen Isabella I of Castile, who financed the travel for the &quot;Discovery of America&quot;.

Cardinal Cisneros granted the town a new &quot;fuero&quot; in 1509.
Despite being largely ruined, the town acquired the status of city in 1687 after long negotiations.

In decadence since the mid-18th century, Alcalá de Henares experienced a relative demographic and economic upturn in the second half of the 19th century, based on its newly acquired condition of military outpost, to which an embryonic industrial nucleus was also added.

The population steadily increased from 1868 to 1939. The population was still agrarian to a large extent, with high levels of illiteracy and poverty. Seeking social change, Republican and later Socialist movements grew in force in the city. The leading figure in the latter movement was , who became the first municipal councillor from the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in the province of Madrid in 1903. Emerging in reaction to Socialist advances, Social catholicism also took hold in the city from 1905, founding a number of organizations such as &quot;Centro Católico de Acción Social Popular&quot; and the &quot;Mutual Obrera Complutense&quot;.

Following the 1936 coup d&#x27;etat that sparked the Spanish Civil War, putschist elements seized key posts around the city. However, following the botched coup in Madrid, Rebel forces in Alcalá eventually surrendered to Republican Colonel Ildefonso Puigdendolas and his troops on 21 July. Alcalá, that reportedly became a Soviet power base during the conflict—a &quot;republic within the republic&quot; where the Republican national government held a tenuous grip—was the place were POUM leader Andrés Nin was transferred to and tortured and killed in June 1937 by NKVD agents.

The city suffered severe damage during the Spanish Civil War.

Thousands of prisoners were held in different camps in the city after the end of the war. From March 1939 to February 1948, at least 264 individuals were executed in Alcalá by the Francoist authorities.

===Ecclesiastical history===

The town of historic importance was one of the first bishoprics founded in Spain.

The polyglot Bible known as the Complutensian Polyglot Bible, the first of the many similar Bibles produced during the revival of Biblical studies that took place in the 16th century, was printed at Alcalá under the care of Cardinal Cisneros.

A papal bull of 7 March 1885, united Alcalá with (effectively merging it into) the diocese of Madrid, which includes the civil province of Madrid, suffragan of the archbishopric of Toledo. The bishop&#x27;s residence has since been used for preserving historical archives. It was designed by Alonso Berruguete and has a famous staircase.

===Jewish history===
During Muslim rule, the Jewish community of the city was granted equal rights as the Christians living in it: special restrictions were not placed on Jews regarding criminal compensation, residency, and other municipal aspects. In the Middle Ages, the Jewish congregation of the city paid taxes to the Archbishop of Toledo. The Jews of Alcalá were mentioned in the 14th-century Satire by Marrano Pero Ferrús. During the 15th century, the Jewish congregation of the city was one of the largest in Castile, having about 200 Jewish families. Hebrew studies at the University of Alcalá were encouraged by Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros during the 16th century, bringing some Jews and Marrano Hebraists to work in the city. The location of the Jewish quarter of the city is well known – between Mayor, Santiago, Imagen and Cervantes streets. One synagogue stood in Carmen Calzado street, no. 10. The other was on Santiago street. After the 1492 Alhambra Decree Jews were required to become Christians to continue living in Castile and Aragon; those who refused had to leave these kingdoms and most of them found residence in the North of Africa, Amsterdam and the Ottoman Empire.

The origins of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; family are supposed (there is no total certainty) to be Jewish. Because his father worked on the former Jewish neighbourhood, the birthplace was close to the workplace, and also because the surname Cervantes makes reference to a different site in the Northwest of Spain, and geographical surnames were common among the Jewish population.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

Alcalá de Henares is located in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula, in the southern half of the Inner Plateau. It lies on the valley of the Henares, a left-bank tributary of the Jarama, which is in turn a right-bank tributary of the Tagus. The right (north) bank of the river (on which the current urban nucleus was built) displays a very flat relief with a series of quaternary fluvial terraces, while the left (southern) bank features a very steep slope of clays from the miocene, rapidly rising up to the moors of La Alcarria.

Standing at an average altitude of 654 m, and occupying some 88 km2; the city was for a long time contained in between the Henares to the South and the Madrid-Barcelona railway to the North. However, the increasing population brought on the sprawl of the urbanised area to the area located in between the railway and the A-2 motorway and beyond.

===Climate===
The climate in this city of central Spain is semi-arid, with cold, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The average year-round temperature is . The average year-round rainfall is about , mainly in spring and autumn. Temperatures vary from some degrees below in December and January to some over in July and August. Dry season coincides with maximum heat in summer.

==University==
The major landmark and one of the great prides of the city, its university, uses sites throughout the city, but has two main campuses. The first is on the north side of Alcalá. This campus includes most science departments and student housing (as well as its own, separate Renfe station). The second, central campus, houses most of the humanities and social-science departments, including a law school.

The architectural influence of the university can be found in other present-day academic institutions. The University of San Diego is largely based on the Spanish university; its campus and address take the name &quot;Alcalá Park&quot;. In addition, some buildings at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas were modeled after the architecture of Universidad de Alcalá de Henares.
In 1293 in Alcalá de Henares King Sancho IV of Castile founded the &quot;Universidad Complutense&quot;, one of the oldest universities in the world, as a Studium Generale. With the patronage of Cardinal Cisneros, it was recognized in a 1499 papal bull, and quickly gained international fame as a main centre of learning of the Renaissance thanks to the production of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible in 1517, which is the basis for most of the current translations. By royal decree, the university moved to Madrid in 1836 (initially as the Universidad de Madrid, later as the Universidad Central, which in the 1970s would finally be renamed &quot;Universidad Complutense de Madrid&quot;). A new university was founded in the old buildings as the &quot;Universidad de Alcalá&quot; in 1977. Parts of the new university occupy the buildings of the old Universidad Complutense in the city centre, including the modern Colegio de San Ildefonso, the Colegio de Málaga and other &quot;Colegios&quot;, and the structures have served as a model for other universities across the Spanish territories in the Americas and other dependencies.
The university chapel dedicated to Saint Ildefonso has a monument to the university&#x27;s founder, Cardinal Cisneros, by Fancelli, an Italian sculptor.

Although the present university is named &quot;Universidad de Alcalá&quot;, the ancient institution founded by Cisneros is the one now called &quot;Universidad Complutense&quot;, translocated in the capital city of Madrid (&quot;Complutensis&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;native of Alcalá&quot;). The modern university is related to the original institution in name only, although it occupies the former buildings of the Complutense.

==Cathedral==
Aside from the buildings associated with the university, one of the city&#x27;s most important and historic building is the Cathedral-Magistral of Saints Justus and Pastor, known formally in Spanish as the or more familiarly as the . Constructed between 1497 and 1514, the cathedral houses the remains of Saints Justus and Pastor, two Christian schoolboys martyred near the city during the persecutions of the Roman Emperor Diocletian at the beginning of the 4th century.
In 414 a chapel was erected at the site of Justus and Pastor&#x27;s martyrdom, and was converted into a cathedral during the period of Visigoth control of Hispania; bishops from Alcalá were present at the Councils of Toledo beginning in the 7th century. In 1053 the old city of Alcalá (&quot;Alcalá la Vieja&quot;) was conquered by Ferdinand the Great, only to be recaptured the following year by the Moorish armies then warring for control of the Iberian Peninsula, who destroyed the cathedral as an act of retaliation. At that time the relics of Saints Justus and Pastor were taken to Huesca for safekeeping until after the reconquest of Alcalá in 1118. Although a church was rebuilt on the site in 1122, Pope Urban II, under the influence of his friend Raymond de Sauvetât, the Archbishop of Toledo, decided not to restore the Diocese of Alcalá at that time. Instead, de Sauvetât was able to secure the incorporation of Alcalá into his own archiepiscopal territories through a donation from King Alfonso VII in 1129.

The church was rebuilt again some three hundred years later by a subsequent archbishop of Toledo, Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, who elevated it to the status of a collegiate church. It was finally reconstructed in its present Isabelline Gothic style under Cardinal Cisneros (1495–1517), the founder of the university. A tower was added between 1528 and 1582, achieving its modern appearance in 1618. The processional cloister and the Chapel of Saint Peter were incorporated into the building in the 17th century.

The building was declared a national monument in 1904. Nevertheless, it was burned during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and practically all of its contents were destroyed with the exception of a few minor relics and choir seats.

It was not until 1991 that the Diocese of Alcalá was finally restored, being separated from the Archdiocese of Madrid, at which time the building was granted its present status of cathedral-magistral (although the title &quot;magistral&quot; was originally granted by Cardinal Cisneros, the building was still technically only a collegiate church, and not yet a cathedral within the ecclesiastical meaning of the term).

The Cathedral of Alcalá is notable as one of only two churches in the world to be granted the special title &quot;magistral&quot; (along with St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Leuven, Belgium). The title reflects its former status as a collegiate church, and derives from the requirement that all of the canons of the cathedral must possess the academic distinction of Doctor of Theology in order to serve there.

In addition to that of Saints Justus and Pastor, the cathedral also houses the tomb of renowned 17th-century Spanish sculptor Gregorio Fernández.

==Other buildings==
The city is also home to the Archbishops Palace. This site is where Christopher Columbus and King Ferdinand planned the excursion to the West as well as the birthplace of Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, who would be the first wife of King Henry VIII of England and therefore queen consort of England.

Alcalá&#x27;s Corral of Comedies, which hosts a full program of theatre and is open for tours, is the oldest documented corral in the history of Spain.

==The city today==
The center of the city remains essentially medieval, with many winding cobbled streets, and many historic buildings. The city centre surrounds the &quot;Plaza de Cervantes&quot; and is traversed by a long pedestrian main street, the &quot;Calle Mayor&quot;. The city includes the Moorish quarter, the Jewish quarter, and the Christian quarter. These distinct neighborhoods have given Alcalá the reputation of &quot;the city of three cultures&quot;.

The old city centre has been largely preserved, unlike the suburbs. There has been no clear planning by the city councillors regarding expansion, and the sprawling suburban areas are irregularly constructed, with the addition of 1970s-style high rise blocks in many places.

One of the most important streets in the city is the &quot;Calle del Cardenal Cisneros&quot; which takes tourists from the Madrid Gate at the entrance of the city, to the old city center and the cathedral in Santos Niños Square. The main park of Alcalá, Parque Municipal O&#x27;Donnell is a major recreational center for city residents and lies along a main road of Alcalá, Vía Complutense.

Recent archaeological excavations have opened up the city&#x27;s Roman forum where a large complex comprising a basilica, public baths, a cryptoporticus, a market and a large monumental façade stands out. Alongside the forum is the Domus with an extraordinary collection of Roman domestic mural paintings. On the outskirts is the House of Hippolytus, an old school. In turn, the Regional Archaeology Museum (MAR) holds highly valuable mosaics.

The city hosts a large population of international students due to the presence of the university, and in particular its Spanish language and literature programs for foreign students. Alcalingua, a branch of University of Alcalá, is one of the major foreign language learning centers for students from abroad.

===The storks===
Alcalá is well known for its population of white storks. Their large nests can be observed atop many of the churches and historic buildings in the city, and are themselves a significant tourist attraction. Situated in the lowlands of the Henares river, the city is an attractive home for the migratory storks due to the wide availability of food and nesting material in the area.

For over twenty years, Alcalá&#x27;s storks have been counted and studied, and the active protection and maintenance of their nests is by official policy. Although once in danger of disappearing, with only eleven pairs counted between 1986 and 1987, the population has grown to around 90 resident pairs today, many of which have shortened the distance and duration of their typical migrations to remain in the city nearly all year.
==Immigration==
Some 18% of the population are of foreign origin, according to the official data, a large part of the newcomers (30%) are immigrants from Eastern Europe. Many Chinese businesses have also been established in the city. Alcalá has the largest community (18%) of Romanian immigrants in Spain, with over 35,000 people. In 2007, for the first time, the immigrants from Romania created a political party for the elections to come.

== Politics ==
The current mayor of the municipality is Judith Piquet Flores, of the PP. In the most recent 2023 elections, the PP benefitted from the fall of Ciudadanos, as happened nationally.
==Transport==

Alcalá&#x27;s excellent transport links with Madrid have led to its becoming a commuter town, with many of its inhabitants travelling to work in the capital. By Cercanias (railway) is the lines C2 and C7 that links Alcalá de Henares with Madrid in 35 minutes, or Guadalajara in 25 minutes, also exists in the peak hours trains called CIVIS, direct train, that makes the journey in 20 minutes. Also it is linked by bus to Madrid, Guadalajara and several towns and villages in nearby. By car, Alcalá de Henares is well linked with the state roads network with the nearby A-2, the highway which starts in Madrid and continues on to Barcelona and to France.

Alcalá also has an intensive bus system called &quot;Alcalá-Bus&quot; which runs to all the major neighborhoods and costs 1,30 euro per ride. 

== Culture ==
;Cervantine city
The city celebrates the birthday of native son Miguel de Cervantes on 9 October every year and organizes an annual Cervantes festival, the (&quot;Cervantine Week&quot;).

Every year on 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes&#x27; death, the city of Alcalá hosts the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the Spanish-speaking world&#x27;s most prestigious award for lifetime achievement in literature. The award is presented by the king of Spain at the University of Alcalá&#x27;s historic . Speeches about the importance of the Spanish language are customarily given by the king, the minister of culture and the laureate. The ceremony attracts a wide range of dignitaries to the city including members of the royal family, the prime minister, and others. During this ceremony the citizens of Alcalá can be heard singing the city&#x27;s song, entitled &quot;Alcalá de Henares&quot;.

Alcalá de Henares is a member (and promoter) of the Red de Ciudades Cervantinas (Network of Cervantine Cities).
;Festivals
Alcalá hosts an annual &quot;Noche en Blanco&quot;. During this festival the streets are filled with music, art, theatre, and dance as the city residents celebrate Alcalá&#x27;s rich cultural heritage. The festival goes well into the night and centers around the Plaza de Cervantes where stages are set up to host the performances.

<text>The Carlton Football Club, nicknamed the Blues, is a professional Australian rules football club based at Princes Park in Carlton North, an inner suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The club competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s premier competition.

Founded in the 1860s, the club began playing out of parklands historically part of Carlton not far from its current base. It quickly became one of the major football clubs in the city. It was a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), winning the inaugural premiership in 1877. In 1896, Carlton joined the breakaway Victorian Football League (since renamed the AFL), and alongside rivals , , and . It is regarded as one of the league&#x27;s historical &quot;Big Four&quot; clubs, having won sixteen VFL/AFL premierships, equal with Collingwood and Essendon as the most of any AFL club. The club&#x27;s AFL Women&#x27;s team has competed since the league&#x27;s inaugural 2017 AFLW season.

It currently plays its home matches at Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Princes Park is its traditional home ground of the club and is home to its women&#x27;s team. Carlton also has reserves sides in the Victorian Football League and VFL Women&#x27;s.

==Club history==
===Early history===

During a meeting on 17 May 1865 at the University Hotel in Grattan Street Carlton the Carlton Football Club nominated secretary Ben James and president James Linacre respectively. The club formally adopted the Melbourne Football Club rules. This is the earliest record of incorporation however the club believes it was formed earlier based on numerous indirect accounts and officially celebrates anniversaries based on a foundation date of 1864. It also continues to investigate evidence of an earlier foundation, including the proposed formation of a Carlton Football Club on 21 May 1861 connected to a Carlton Cricket Club.

The earliest records of the club playing were from 1865 out of Princes Park in Carlton.

In the early days, Carlton became particularly strong competitively and grew a large supporter base. It became a fierce rival to the Melbourne Football Club in early competitions, including the South Yarra Challenge Cup, and the club is recognised as senior Victorian premiers in 1871, 1873, 1874 and 1875.

===Victorian Football Association and Victorian Football League===
In 1877, Carlton was one of the foundation clubs of the Victorian Football Association, and was a comfortable winner of the premiership in the competition&#x27;s inaugural season.

Carlton was one of the first clubs to have a player worthy of the superstar tag: champion player George Coulthard, who played for Carlton between 1876 and 1882, and was noted by &quot;The Australasian&quot; as &#x27;The grandest player of the day&#x27;. He died of tuberculosis in 1883, aged 27.
The club won one more VFA premiership, in 1887, but after that, particularly during the 1890s, the club went from one of the strongest clubs in the Association to one of the weaker, both on-field and off-field. In spite of this, the club was invited to join the breakaway Victorian Football League competition in 1897. The club continued to struggle in early seasons of the new competition, and finished seventh out of eight teams in each of its first five seasons.

===Jack Worrall to World War I===
Carlton&#x27;s fortunes improved significantly in 1902. The Board elected the highly respected former Fitzroy footballer and Australian test cricketer Jack Worrall, then the secretary of the Carlton Cricket Club, to the same position at the football club. As secretary, Worrall slowly took over the managing of the players, in what is now recognised as the first official coaching role in the VFL. Under Worrall&#x27;s guidance in the latter part of the 1902 season, Carlton&#x27;s on-field performances improved, and in 1903 he led Carlton to the finals for the first time.
Carlton built a strong reputation and financial position, and was able to convince many great players to shift to the club from other clubs, or even (in the case of Mick Grace) out of retirement. Worrall led the club to its first three VFL premierships, won consecutively, in 1906, 1907 and 1908. Carlton became the first club in the VFL to win three premierships in a row, and its win–loss record of 19–1 in the 1908 season (including finals) was a record which stood for more than ninety years.

Following these premierships, Carlton went through a tumultuous period off-field. Some players had become frustrated by low payments and hard training standards, and responded by refusing to train or even play matches. The club removed Worrall from the coaching role (he retained the role of secretary), and after significant changes at board level after the 1909 season, Worrall left the club altogether. Many players who had supported Worrall left the club at the end of the season. Then, in 1910, several players were suspected of having taken bribes to fix matches, with two players (Alex Lang and Doug Fraser) both found guilty and suspended for 99 matches. Despite this backdrop, Carlton continued its strong on-field form, reaching the 1909 and 1910 Grand Finals, but losing both.
Carlton fell out of the finals in 1913, but returned in 1914 under coach Norm Clark, and with many inexperienced players, to win back-to-back premierships in 1914 and 1915 VFL seasons. Most football around the country was suspended during the height of World War I, but Carlton continued to compete in a VFL which featured, at its fewest, only four clubs. Altogether, between Jack Worrall&#x27;s first Grand Final in 1904 and the peak of World War I in 1916, Carlton won five premierships and contested nine Grand Finals for one of the most successful times in the club&#x27;s history. The only success which eluded the club was the Championship of Australia; Carlton contested the championship three times (1907, 1908 and 1914), with its South Australian opponents victorious on all three occasions.

===Between the wars===
Through the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s, Carlton maintained a strong on-field presence. The club was a frequent finalist, contesting fourteen finals series between the wars. However, premiership success did not follow, and the club contested only three Grand Finals for just one premiership during this period, and endured the second longest premiership drought (23 years) in the club&#x27;s history. The drought was broken with the club&#x27;s sixth VFL premiership in 1938, when former Subiaco and South Melbourne champion Brighton Diggins was recruited by the club to serve as captain-coach.

On-field, Carlton&#x27;s inter-war period was highlighted by two of its greatest goalkickers: in the 1920s, Horrie Clover (396 goals in 147 games), and in the 1930s, Harry &quot;Soapy&quot; Vallence (722 goals in 204 games), both of which were Carlton career records at the time.

===1941–64===

The VFL continued to operate through World War II. With the retirement of Diggins, Carlton secured the services of former coach Percy Bentley, who coached the club for fifteen seasons. Carlton continued to finish in or near the finals without premiership success through the war, before winning the premiership in 1945, one month after peace. In a remarkable season, Carlton languished with a record of 3–6 after nine weeks, but won ten of the remaining eleven home-and-away matches to finish fourth; Carlton then comfortably beat in the first semi-final, overcame a 28-point deficit in the final quarter to beat Collingwood in the preliminary final, then beat South Melbourne in the notoriously brutal and violent Bloodbath Grand Final.

Carlton contested two more Grand Finals in the 1940s, both against , winning the 1947 Grand Final by a single point, and being comfortably beaten in 1949. Thereafter followed what was then Carlton&#x27;s weakest on-field period since Worrall&#x27;s appointment in 1902, with the club reaching the finals only four times between 1950 and 1964. Finishing tenth out of twelve and winning only five matches, 1964 was Carlton&#x27;s worst VFL season to that point in its history.

===Ron Barassi to 1973===
A change of president at the end of 1964 heralded the most successful period in the Carlton Football Club&#x27;s history. Between 1967 and 1988, Carlton missed the finals only three times, contested ten Grand Finals, and won seven premierships.

The period of success began when George Harris replaced Lew Holmes as president of the club, after the 1964 season. Harris then signed legend Ron Barassi serve as coach from 1965. Barassi was a six-time premiership player and two-time premiership captain at Melbourne during its most successful era, and at the age of 28 was still one of the biggest names in the game. His shift to Carlton remains one of the biggest player transfers in the game&#x27;s history. Also contributing to Carlton&#x27;s success was the strength of the Bendigo Football League, to which Carlton gained recruitment access through the VFL&#x27;s country zoning arrangements.

Under Barassi, Carlton reached three consecutive Grand Finals between 1968 and 1970, resulting in two premierships: 1968 against Essendon and 1970 against traditional rivals Collingwood. The 1970 Grand Final remains one of the most famous matches in football history. Played in front of an enduring record crowd of 121,696, Collingwood dominated early to lead by 44 points at half time, but Carlton kicked seven goals in fifteen minutes after half time to narrow the margin to only three points; after a close final quarter, Carlton won its tenth VFL premiership with a ten-point victory. Carlton won its first and second Championship of Australia titles in 1968 and 1970, beating the SANFL&#x27;s Sturt Football Club in both seasons.

Carlton missed the finals in 1971, and Barassi left the club at the end of the season, but Carlton returned to prominence the following year, and contested back-to-back Grand Finals. Both matches were against , with Carlton recording a high-scoring victory in 1972, and losing a rough, physical encounter in 1973.

Of the legendary players from the Barassi era, none was more important than John Nicholls, who captained all three premierships and took over as captain-coach upon Barassi&#x27;s departure. Nicholls, a ruckman and forward, had played at Carlton since 1957, and he and Graham Farmer (who played with and in the WAFL during the same era) are regarded as the greatest ruckmen in the league&#x27;s history. Midfielders Sergio Silvagni and Adrian Gallagher, half-forward Robert Walls, and ruckman Percy Jones were also prominent throughout the Barassi era, and in 1970, Alex Jesaulenko became the first (and to date, only) Carlton forward to kick 100 goals in a season.

===1975–82===
Carlton continued to play finals through the 1970s without premiership success, and went through several coaches in a short period of time: Nicholls (until 1975), Ian Thorogood (1976–77), Ian Stewart (for only three matches in 1978), and Alex Jesaulenko as playing coach after Stewart&#x27;s departure. It was not until 1979 that Carlton again reached the Grand Final, defeating by five points in a close match best remembered for the late goal kicked by Ken Sheldon, after Wayne Harmes tapped the ball into the goalsquare from the boundary line.

After the 1979 season, there was off-field instability at the board level. Ian Rice replaced George Harris as president, and many of Harris&#x27; supporters left the club, including Jesaulenko, who went to . Percy Jones replaced Jesaulenko as coach in 1980, before coach David Parkin was recruited in 1981, Carlton&#x27;s sixth coach in eight seasons.

Despite the off-field troubles, Carlton continued to thrive on-field, and Parkin led the team to back-to-back premierships in 1981 and 1982, with victories in the Grand Finals against Collingwood and respectively. With its fourteenth premiership in 1982, Carlton overtook Collingwood to become the most successful club in the league&#x27;s history, based on premierships won – a position it has held either outright or jointly with since.

Starring on-field during this period for Carlton was Bruce Doull, regarded as one of the best half-back flankers in the history of the league. Wayne Johnston was a prominent centreman/forward, and Carlton had great success recruiting high-profile Western Australian footballers to the club, including Mike Fitzpatrick, Ken Hunter and Peter Bosustow.

===1983–2001===
In 1983, John Elliott took over the presidency from Ian Rice. On-field, the club endured three consecutive unsuccessful finals campaigns under Parkin before he was replaced by Robert Walls in 1986. Also in 1986, Carlton lured three of South Australia&#x27;s top young players to the club: Stephen Kernahan, Craig Bradley and Peter Motley. The club reached the next two Grand Finals, losing in 1986 and winning in 1987, both times against . Kernahan went on to become the club&#x27;s longest serving captain and leading career goalkicker (738 goals), and Bradley became the club games record holder (375 games); Motley&#x27;s career was unfortunately cut short by a non-fatal car accident in 1987. Carlton had also recruited Stephen Silvagni (son of Sergio) in 1985, who is now recognised as one of the greatest fullbacks of all-time, and secured the league&#x27;s star player Greg Williams in a trade in 1992.

David Parkin returned to coach the club from 1991 until 2000, and Carlton was a mainstay of the finals throughout most of this time. In 1995, Carlton became the first team to win twenty matches in a home-and-away season (finishing with a record of 20–2), and won the Grand Final against to claim its sixteenth premiership. Carlton reached two other Grand Finals during the 1990s, losing to Essendon in 1993 and to the Kangaroos in 1999; in 1999, Carlton had come from sixth on the home-and-away ladder to qualify for the Grand Final, famously beating its rival Essendon (the minor premiers) by one point in the preliminary final.

===Period of struggle (2002–2021)===

In 2002, Carlton swiftly fell from being one of the most successful clubs, both on-field and off-field, to one of the least successful. The club had been much slower than others to embrace the AFL Draft as a means for recruitment, so when its champion players from the 1990s began to retire in the early 2000s, on-field performances fell away quickly, and in 2002, the club won the wooden spoon for the first time in its VFL/AFL history; it was the last of the twelve Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon. At the same time, the club was starting to struggle financially, due to unwise investments under John Elliott – most significantly, building a new grandstand at Princes Park during the 1990s, at a time when other clubs were finding it more profitable to play at the higher-capacity central venues. Then, at the end of 2002, it was revealed that Carlton had been systematically cheating the league salary cap during the early 2000s. The scandal resulted in the loss of draft picks and a fine of $930,000, which exacerbated the club&#x27;s poor on-field and off-field positions.

In the immediate fall-out from 2002, president John Elliott was voted out by the members, and was replaced with Docklands Stadium CEO Ian Collins. Under Collins, the club shifted its home stadium from Princes Park to Docklands, with the final match played at Princes Park in 2005. Additionally, coach Wayne Brittain was sacked, and replaced with Kangaroos coach Denis Pagan. On-field performances did not improve under Pagan, and overall the club won three wooden spoons and finished in the bottom two five times between 2002 and 2007.

Carlton&#x27;s overall position began to improve in 2007, when businessman Richard Pratt, Steven Icke and Collingwood&#x27;s Greg Swann came to the club as president, general manager of football operations, and CEO respectively; although Pratt&#x27;s presidency lasted only sixteen months, after which he was replaced by Stephen Kernahan, the new personnel stabilised the club&#x27;s off-field position. Pagan was sacked as coach mid-season after a string of heavy defeats, and was replaced by former club captain and assistant coach Brett Ratten. Then, prior to the 2008 season, Carlton was able to secure a trade for &#x27;s Chris Judd, one of the league&#x27;s best midfielders, to join the club as captain. The time spent at the bottom of the ladder also allowed Carlton to secure three No. 1 draft picks – Marc Murphy, Bryce Gibbs and Matthew Kreuzer – who helped the club&#x27;s on-field position. Brett Ratten led Carlton to the finals from 2009 until 2011, but was sacked with a year remaining on his contract after the club missed the finals in 2012, and was replaced by former and premiership coach Mick Malthouse. Under Malthouse, the club returned to the finals in 2013, but fell to thirteenth in 2014.

Kernahan stepped aside in mid-2014, and was replaced by Mark LoGiudice, who presided over a period of mediocre onfield results. The relationship between Malthouse and the club&#x27;s quickly and publicly deteriorated; and in early 2015, after giving a radio interview critical of the board, Malthouse was sacked the club going on to finish last. Former Hawthorn assistant coach Brendon Bolton took over as coach from the 2016 season, leading only into his fourth season before he too was sacked after overseeing the team&#x27;s decline to another wooden spoon in 2018 with a 2–20 record, the worst win–loss record in its VFL/AFL history, followed by an equally weak 1–10 start to the 2019 season. Bolton&#x27;s replacement, David Teague, helped the club avoid the 2019 wooden spoon, but lasted only two years into a three-year contract without a finals appearance.

===Voss era (2022–present)===
LoGiudice handed over the presidency to Luke Sayers in August 2021, and Sayers conducted an extensive independent review of the football department during the second half of that season; Teague was sacked, and Michael Voss was appointed senior coach.

Voss led the club to finals in his second and third seasons, ending what had become a club-record nine year VFL/AFL finals drought, with a best result of a preliminary final defeat in 2023. During this time, Carlton achieved two of its greatest individual successes, with captain Patrick Cripps becoming the club&#x27;s first dual Brownlow Medallist and full forward Charlie Curnow becoming the club&#x27;s first back-to-back Coleman Medallist.

==Club symbols==
===Guernsey===
The current Carlton guernsey is navy blue, emblazoned with a white CFC monogram (which stands for &quot;Carlton Football Club&quot;) on the front, and white numbers on the back. This guernsey design is specified in the club&#x27;s constitution. Other than changes to the font of the monogram, this has been Carlton&#x27;s guernsey continually since 1909. The club has worn navy blue in its uniform since 1871, when colour of the team&#x27;s caps was changed from orange/yellow. The club&#x27;s on-and-off field apparel was manufactured by Nike from 1998 until 2019, and by Puma from 2020 until at least 2029.

The team wears navy blue shorts in home games, and white shorts in away games. Since the introduction of clash guernseys in 2007, Carlton has had several clash designs which have been mostly white, with navy blue monogram, numbers, trimmings and minor panels in a variety of combinations. Designs in predominantly sky blue (2011–2012) and silver (2018) have also been used.

===Nickname===
Carlton&#x27;s official nickname is the &#x27;Blues&#x27;. Since the addition of navy blue to the playing uniform in 1871, the club has been known almost universally in print media as the Blues, Dark Blues or Navy Blues. Other colloquial nicknames include Bluebaggers or &#x27;Baggers. Prior to 1871, when the uniform was predominantly chamois, the club was known informally as the Butchers.

For a time after World War II, the club briefly considered changing its nickname to the Cockatoos, but this never formally eventuated; even so, the association with the nickname was strong enough that newspaper cartoons depicting a Carlton cockatoo were common. The cockatoo connection derived from the talking cockatoo brought to home matches by club member Bob St. Marr for more than 30 years; intelligent enough to squawk its support for Carlton and loud enough to be heard over the crowd, &#x27;Cocky Marr&#x27; had become an unofficial live mascot for the club until the bird&#x27;s death in 1939.

===Club song===
Carlton&#x27;s club song is &quot;We Are the Navy Blues&quot;. The lyrics are believed to have been written in around 1930 by cousins Irene McEldrew and Agnes Wright, who ran a boarding house for several club players and the latter of whom was the niece of then-coach Dan Minogue. It is sung to the tune of &quot;Lily of Laguna&quot;.

===Home grounds, headquarters, training and administrative base===

The club&#x27;s traditional home ground is Princes Park (currently known as Ikon Park), located in North Carlton. After struggling to find a permanent home venue during its time in the VFA, Carlton established Princes Park as its home venue when it joined the VFL in 1897. The club played most of its home matches at Princes Park every year between 1897 and 2004 (except for 2002, when it played only four home games there), and a single farewell game was staged at the venue in 2005. It was the last of the suburban home grounds to be used in AFL competition. The venue remains Carlton&#x27;s training and administrative base, and the club&#x27;s current 40-year lease on the venue with the City of Melbourne runs until 2035.

Since 2005, Carlton has split its home games between Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with six matches at the former and five at latter in most years. The matches expected to draw the highest crowds are usually scheduled for the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

==Rivalries==
===Collingwood===

Carlton possesses a long and bitter rivalry with , with the rivalry considered to be one of the most historic and significant in Australian sport, dating back to their spiteful 1910 Grand Final.

They have met six times in Grand Finals, with Carlton successful in all bar the first. Carlton home matches between the club contest the Richard Pratt Cup, and Collingwood home matches are designated as the Peter Mac Cup. They also share the same amount of premierships, at 16.

===Essendon===

Carlton also has rivalry with Essendon. With 16 premierships apiece, the two teams, along with Collingwood, are the joint most successful teams in the VFL/AFL history.

===Richmond===
Carlton has a rivalry with Richmond, with this rivalry based on geographical proximity and large supporter bases. The two teams contested four grand finals between 1969 and 1982, and since 2008 have met annually on a Thursday night in round 1 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, usually as the opening game of the season.

==Club honours==

===Carlton Team of the Century===

Four emergencies were also named: (1) Laurie Kerr, (2) Bob Chitty, (3) Horrie Clover and (4) Rod McGregor. The five players with an asterisk(*) are also members of the AFL Team of the Century – the largest number of any AFL club.

==Hall of Fame==
The Carlton Football Club established its Hall of Fame in 1987, with nine inaugural inductees. Each year between 1988 and 2001 an additional three to five people were inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. After a five-year break, an additional ten people were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2006. As of May 2016, there have been 77 inductees.

A year after the AFL added a Legends category to the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Carlton added a Legends category to its hall of fame in 1997. As of 2023, there are 16 Legends in the Hall of Fame: Craig Bradley, Bert Deacon, Bruce Doull, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Johnston, Stephen Kernahan, John Nicholls, Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence (all elevated in 1997); Ken Hands (2006); Robert Walls (2011); Geoff Southby (2013); Sergio Silvagni (2016); David McKay (2021); and Horrie Clover and Ian Collins (2023).

==Reserves team==
Carlton&#x27;s seconds/reserves team was established in 1919; it operated semi-independently of the senior club until 1936, when the senior club&#x27;s committee fully took over its operations. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition, and from 1992 to 1999 a &quot;de facto&quot; AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League. The Carlton Football Club fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Carlton in the lower grade. During that time, the Carlton reserves team won eight premierships (1926, 1927, 1928, 1951, 1953, 1986, 1987, 1990). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the Carlton reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League for three seasons from 2000 until 2002.

The reserves team was dissolved at the end of 2002, and Carlton entered a reserves affiliation with existing VFL club, the Northern Bullants. Under the affiliation, reserves players for Carlton played VFL football with the Northern Bullants. The partnership between the two clubs was strengthened in 2012, when the Northern Bullants were renamed the Northern Blues and they adopted Carlton&#x27;s navy blue colours, and the club split its home games between the VFL club&#x27;s traditional home, the Preston City Oval; and Carlton&#x27;s traditional home, Ikon Park.

Carlton terminated the affiliation with the Northern Blues in early 2020, as a cost saving measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, and re-established a dedicated reserves team in the VFL for the 2021 season.

===Development systems===
Under the AFL&#x27;s 2016 plan to establish club-branded Next Generation Academies across Australia to give all AFL clubs a more active role in junior development, Carlton was allocated the northern metropolitan zone of Melbourne. The academy is linked to the Preston-based Northern Knights in the statewide under-18s system.

Since 2019, the club has operated the Carlton College of Sports, a higher education institution in partnership with La Trobe University, which offers sports education diplomas and is operated out of the redeveloped grandstands at Ikon Park.

==Women&#x27;s teams==

The Carlton Football Club operates two senior women&#x27;s teams: one team in the national AFL Women&#x27;s competition, which it has fielded since the 2017 AFLW season; and one team in the state VFL Women&#x27;s competition, which has been fielded since the 2018 VFLW season.

===History===
Carlton was a key cog in the establishment of Women&#x27;s football in the state of Victoria. In August 1933 the club hosted the first ever VFL sanctioned match between women&#x27;s teams, with sides representing Carlton and Richmond. Though Richmond&#x27;s side was not associated directly with the VFL club of the same name, the Carlton side was picked and trained by the club with VFL players Mickey Crisp and Ray Brew as coaches. The match, played at Carlton&#x27;s home Princes Park drew an estimated crowd of 10,000 and raised funds as part of a VFL bye-week carnival for The Royal Melbourne Hospital.

The club next fielded a women&#x27;s team more than a decade later when it competed in a 1947 charity exhibition series raising funds in support of food shortages in post-war Commonwealth countries. The club&#x27;s team played multiple matches in multiple series that season including a match against Footscray in July and a subsequent series against , South Melbourne, and Footscray in August 1947.

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===

In June 2016, Carlton was granted a licence to establish and field a team in the eight team AFL Women&#x27;s league, which is set to stage its inaugural season in February–March 2017. The team is run and fully integrated within the Carlton Football Club, with football operation overseen by existing Head of Football Andrew McKay. Damien Keeping served as the team&#x27;s inaugural head coach, and the club&#x27;s existing Female Football Ambassador, Lauren Arnell, served as the inaugural captain; she, along with Marquee players and Darcy Vescio and Brianna Davey were the club&#x27;s inaugural marquee signings.

In 2018, the Western Bulldogs and Carlton women&#x27;s teams held the first Pride game in the AFLW, to celebrate gender diversity, promote inclusion for LGBTIQA+ players, and to help stamp out homophobia. After being joined by other clubs, in 2020, the first full AFLW Pride Round was held in 2021, supported by all 18 clubs in the league.

In its short history, the team has played in one Grand Final, which it lost against Adelaide in 2019.

;Current squad
===VFL Women&#x27;s team===

Prior the 2018 season, Carlton was granted a licence to field a team in the VFL Women&#x27;s competition. The VFLW team originally operated under a separate program to the club&#x27;s AFLW team, however in 2021 the VFLW was formally aligned with the AFLW competition, similar to the men&#x27;s AFL/VFL system.

<text>Are You Being Served? is a British television sitcom that was broadcast from 1972 to 1985. It was created and written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. Croft also served as executive producer and director. Michael Knowles and John Chapman also wrote certain episodes. Produced by the BBC, the series starred Mollie Sugden, Trevor Bannister, Frank Thornton, John Inman, Wendy Richard, Arthur Brough, Nicholas Smith, Larry Martyn, Harold Bennett and Arthur English.

Set in London, the show follows the misadventures and mishaps of the staff and their regular rotating series of customers at the retail ladies&#x27; and gentlemen&#x27;s clothing departments in the flagship department store of a fictional chain called Grace Brothers.

The series was broadcast on the BBC for ten series, totalling 69 episodes between 8 September 1972 and 1 April 1985 – including five Christmas specials. The sitcom proved a ratings hit with UK audiences, and gained international recognition when broadcast across several English-speaking countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the Republic of Ireland, and the United States; the latter gaining it a loyal following when PBS television stations began airing reruns in the mid-1980s, along with other British sitcoms.

&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; was one of several series predominant at the period that was adapted into a feature film release. It was adapted into the 1977 film of the same name and was also followed by the spin-off series &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; with the same main cast in 1991–1992. In 2004, it was ranked 20th in a television countdown of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. A one-off episode with a new cast was created in 2016. Both the sitcom – including its pilot and Christmas specials – the spin-off and the film have since been released on DVD.

==Premise==
&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; focuses on the lives of the staff of the fictional department store Grace Brothers, who work within the clothing departments for men and women respectively, alongside their senior staff, maintenance workers and the store&#x27;s owner. The sitcom focused on the staff dealing with various issues such as frictions between each other, ideas to improve sales, and the effects of local events that impacted the store&#x27;s running. A key humorous base of the series was a parody of the British class system, which permeated a range of relationships and interactions between the show&#x27;s characters, such as conversations between the maintenance men and sales personnel or management. The episodes rarely featured locations outside the store, mostly being focused on the shop floor used by the two departments, and the staff-only areas. Characters also rarely addressed each other by their first names, even after work, instead using their surnames in the manner of &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, or &quot;Mrs&quot;.

The sitcom featured humour based on sexual innuendo, misunderstanding, mistaken identity, farce, and occasional slapstick. In addition, there were sight gags generated by outrageous costumes which the characters were sometimes required to wear for store promotions, and gaudy store displays sometimes featuring malfunctioning robotic mannequins. The show is remembered for its prolific use of double entendres. Alongside the comedy, some episodes also conducted specialised dance routines which were choreographed either to be natural or sometimes comedic in effect.

==Production==
===Programme conception===
The idea for the show came from Lloyd&#x27;s brief period in the early 1950s working at Simpsons of Piccadilly, a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until its closing in 1999. The inspiration for the store has also been credited to the former Clements of Watford where the concept of the floor walker character Captain Peacock was devised.

===Airing===

The pilot episode was created as part of the &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; series, although the BBC had originally chosen not to broadcast the programme. The pilot was used as a filler during the 1972 Summer Olympics when the coverage of the games was interrupted by the Munich massacre on 8 September 1972, leading to a full series being produced. The pilot episode was repeated before the first series began, on 14 March 1973. Although the first series was aired in the same timeslot as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on ITV, consequently receiving relatively little attention, the repeats shown later in the year were much more successful.

The show became a ratings hit and, after a successful 13-year run, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; came to an end on 1 April 1985.

Of the original cast, only Frank Thornton, Mollie Sugden, John Inman, Wendy Richard and Nicholas Smith appeared in all 69 episodes. The same five later featured in the sequel sitcom, &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; (also known as &quot;Are You Being Served? Again!&quot;). The cast performed in character for a stage sketch on the BBC1 programme &quot;Variety&quot; on 19 June 1976.

===Restoration of the 1972 pilot===
Although the pilot was produced in colour, the videotape was wiped in the 1970s, leaving only a 16mm black-and-white film telerecording, which was made for international syndication to countries where colour television broadcasts had not been adopted. In 2009, the pilot episode was restored to colour using the colour recovery technique previously used for the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot;. The restored colour version was first shown on BBC2 on 1 January 2010 as part of a special &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; night. As of 2024, the colour version has yet to be released on DVD or Blu-ray.

===Theme tune===
The theme tune, written by the show&#x27;s co-writer David Croft and composer Ronnie Hazlehurst, consists of an imaginary lift girl, voiced by Stephanie Gathercole, also Mr Rumbold&#x27;s first secretary, (r.n. Reeve), (1944–2011), announcing each floor over the &quot;musique concrète&quot; sounds of a cash register and a simple musical accompaniment.

The 1977 &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; film has a different version of the theme tune which is longer, in a different key and without the floor announcements. A remix of the theme was released in 1996 by a dance act calling itself &quot;Grace Brothers&quot;, and featured vocal samples of John Inman and Frank Thornton.

There is an homage to the theme tune in the Ladytron song &quot;Paco!&quot; from the album &quot;604&quot;, and New Zealand band Minuit&#x27;s &quot;I hate guns&quot;. A lugubrious version of the theme tune is featured on the album &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot; by the experimental music group Coil. The theme tune has also been covered by Australian band Regurgitator on their 1999 album &quot;...art&quot;. Pop singer Jamelia&#x27;s song &quot;Window Shopping&quot; (from her 2006 album &quot;Walk with Me&quot;) begins with a sample of the familiar cash register sound effect as well as Mrs Slocombe&#x27;s voice inquiring, &quot;Good morning, Mr Grainger; are you free?&quot;

The song was also used in a 2016 Audi advertisement for their Quattro range.

==Cast==
* John Inman as Mr Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries: a camp-acting sales assistant (later the senior) in gents&#x27; clothing. Inman often portrayed the character as being implied to have a gay lifestyle, with Humphries often frequently using double entendres in episodes. During the first series, a senior BBC executive ordered David Croft to drop Inman&#x27;s character from the sitcom after disliking the character&#x27;s personality, prompting Croft to threaten to leave the BBC if he was forced to do so.
* Mollie Sugden as Mrs Betty Slocombe: a senior sales assistant and head of the ladies&#x27; department, often portrayed with a different hair colour in each episode. The sitcom frequently saw Sugden&#x27;s character telling double entendre stories about her pet cat, often referring to it as &quot;my pussy&quot;.
* Wendy Richard as Miss Shirley Brahms: a young, attractive, working-class, cockney-speaking junior sales assistant to Mrs Slocombe, who sometimes referred to her as &quot;dead common&quot;.
* Frank Thornton as Captain Stephen Peacock: a haughty floorwalker who purportedly fought in the North Africa Campaign of World War II, although in one episode a wartime acquaintance reveals him to have been a NAAFI corporal. Croft designed the character to command respect and often act as leader during difficult times, with little backstory exploration.
* Arthur Brough as Mr Ernest Grainger (series 1–5): a 40-year veteran of Grace Brothers, a senior sales assistant and head of the gents&#x27; department. Croft devised the character as being somewhat dislikeful and displaying his age such as sleeping during opening hours. Brough made his final appearance as Grainger in the 1977 film, dying before taping began on the sixth series.
* Trevor Bannister as Mr James/Dick Lucas (series 1–7): a young, penniless, womanising junior salesman in the gents&#x27; department, often cheeky and mocking to the female staff in the ladies&#x27; department. Bannister maintained his role in the show until the end of the seventh series, before leaving to focus on his other commitments. In an interview held after the sitcom&#x27;s conclusion, Wendy Richard claimed the sitcom was originally devised to be a platform for Bannister to secure his career on other television programmes.
* Nicholas Smith as Mr Cuthbert Rumbold: an autocratic, obsequious person, but an altogether bumbling and incompetent floor manager. He seemed to never understand explanations, but used his own confused interpretations to create comedy effect.
* Harold Bennett as &quot;Young&quot; Mr Grace (series 1–8): the elderly but stingy owner of Grace Bros, often portrayed with attractive young women and a running joke of him being respected despite being slightly too old for his position. Bennett died following the eighth series, prior to the broadcast of the 1981 Christmas special; his character was referenced in the first episode of the spinoff series &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;.
* Larry Martyn as Mr Mash (series 1–3): a working class stock and maintenance man at Grace Bros, often mistreated by Peacock due to rules regarding the presence of maintenance staff during opening hours. The character was designed to help portray some of the specially designed comedic display units that would feature in episodes. Martyn left the sitcom after the 1975 Christmas special, with his character written out of the programme.
* Doremy Vernon as Diana Yardswick (series 3–4, 6–10): manageress of the department store&#x27;s staff canteen, often ill-tempered and sarcastic, and favours enforcement of strict social order for staff. The character was initially minor in appearance, but by the later series in the sitcom, was given more prominence in episodes.
* Arthur English as Mr Beverley Harman (series 4–10): a working class stock and maintenance man at Grace Bros, who garners more friendly relations with the floor staff than Mr Mash. English&#x27;s character was created after Martyn&#x27;s character was written out of the series, with Harman becoming a staple in the sitcom through much of its broadcast.
* James Hayter as Mr Percival Tebbs (series 6) – A prominent salesman assigned to the men&#x27;s department in order to replace Mr Grainger. The character was created following the death of Brough, but lasted only one series. Hayter left the series after the sixth series, when he was paid generously to do so by a snack manufacturer who wanted him to exclusively voice their television adverts. 
* Alfie Bass as Mr Harry Goldberg (series 7) – A senior salesman, originally a junior, brought in to replace Mr Tebbs after retiring. Bass was brought in to replace Hayter after his departure, but dropped out of the programme following the conclusion of the seventh series.
* Mike Berry as Mr Bert Spooner (series 8–10): A junior sales assistant, mimicking similar traits to Mr Lucas. Berry was brought in to replace Bannister following his departure from the programme.
* Kenneth Waller as &quot;Old&quot; Mr Grace (series 8): &quot;Young&quot; Mr Grace&#x27;s even-older brother, who took over the running of Grace Bros while his younger brother took a sabbatical to write his memoirs. Like &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;″s Clive Dunn, Waller was much younger than his character&#x27;s age and so underwent makeup similar to Dunn to &quot;age up&quot;. The actor was brought in to replace Bennett, who left the series after the first episode of Series 8 due to declining health. &quot;Old&quot; Mr. Grace wasn&#x27;t received well by fans, so he was dropped in favour of bringing back &quot;Young&quot; Mr. Grace as an invisible character.
* Milo Sperber as Mr Grossman (series 8): An expert shoe salesman assigned to the shop floor between men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27;. The character was brought in as a replacement for Mr. Goldberg, but Mr. Sperber dropped out after four episodes to take a lucrative movie role.
* Benny Lee as Mr Abraham Klein (series 8): A sales assistant assigned to the gents&#x27; department to help out with upcoming sales in the store. Like Sperber, Lee lasted only four episodes before writers dropped his character from the sitcom.
* Candy Davis as Miss Belfridge (series 9–10); Mr Rumbold&#x27;s last and longest-running secretary, admired by the male staff on the shop floor.

==Episodes==
&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; was initially broadcast from 1973 to 1985. Each series had between five and nine episodes. Counting the pilot episode, all episodes and specials from the series, and the film, the show ran for sixty-nine episodes and ten series. Each episode was self-contained, with no continuing story or theme throughout the series.

===Film===

In 1977, as for many other sitcoms of the time, a feature film was released. The film version of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; followed the staff of Grace Brothers taking a package holiday together while the store is closed for redecoration, a loose adaptation of the play version from the year before. Set in the fictional resort of Costa Plonka, in Spain, the entire cast of the television series reprised their roles in the film. Reviews of the film were generally mixed, with the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; reviewer John Pym declaring, &quot;The humour consists mainly of withering selection of patent British puns; an inflatable brassiere, some let&#x27;s-insult-the-Germans jokes and a rickey thunder-box which bolts from the outside are thrown in for good measure.&quot;

===&quot;The Best of Are You Being Served?&quot; (1992)===
Buoyed by the huge success of the series in the United States, BBC America commissioned a special straight-to-VHS compilation in 1992. Running at 78 minutes, &quot;The Best of Are You Being Served&quot; featured newly shot scenes of Mr Humphries reminiscing with his elderly mother, Annie, about his time working at Grace Brothers. Both roles were played by John Inman. The additional sequences were filmed in America, when John Inman was in Phoenix, AZ to promote the show on the local PBS channel, and directed by Don Hopfer.

===2016 revival===
In 2016, a one-off revival episode was announced and filmed at dock10 studios. It was broadcast as part of BBC&#x27;s Landmark Sitcom Season, a celebration of 60 years of television sitcoms. It was set in 1988 with the original characters, played by a new cast.

Former &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; actor John Challis portrayed Captain Peacock; former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actors Sherrie Hewson and Roy Barraclough were cast as Mrs Slocombe and Mr Grainger respectively, and comedian Arthur Smith as Mr Harman. Mr Humphries was portrayed by Jason Watkins, Miss Brahms by Niky Wardley, and Mr Rumbold by Justin Edwards. New characters introduced in the show included Young Mr Grace&#x27;s grandson, also called Young Mr Grace, played by Mathew Horne; Miss Croft, named as a tribute to series co-creator David Croft, played by Jorgie Porter; and newcomer Mr Conway, played by Kayode Ewumi. The episode was written by Derren Litten. The BBC issued a press release saying: &quot;It&#x27;s 1988 and Young Mr Grace is determined to drag Grace Brothers into, well 1988, but he has a problem on his hands. Mr Humphries, Captain Peacock, Mr Rumbold and Mrs Slocombe all seem to be stuck in another era. A new member of staff, Mr Conway, joins the team but will he help shake things up or will he just put a pussy amongst the pigeons?&quot;

The episode was aired in August 2016 to universally poor reviews for both the writing and the acting. No further episodes were commissioned.

==Other adaptations==
===Spin-off===

Almost immediately after the cancellation of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in 1985, the cast began suggesting a spin-off to Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft. Though all felt the department store format was exhausted, it was suggested the characters could be moved to a new location. In 1992, most of the original cast reunited for &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; (known as &quot;Are You Being Served Again!&quot; in the United States and Canada). The new series followed the characters after Young Mr Grace&#x27;s death, when they are forced to run a hotel in a dilapidated manor house that was purchased using their pension fund. &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; ran for two series.

===Play===
In the summer of 1976, a stage adaptation of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; ran at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool. Directed by Robert Redfarn. John Inman, Mollie Sugden, Frank Thornton, Wendy Richard, and Nicholas Smith reprised their characters from the television show while the characters of Mr Lucas, Mr Grainger, and Mr Mash were recast. The play had basically the same plot as the film version which would debut the next year, though Young Mr Grace&#x27;s role was omitted entirely and Mr Mash had less to do than Mr Harman in the film. Reviews for the play were mixed; a writer for the Blackpool &quot;Diarist of the Stage&quot; declared it the funniest show he had seen in thirty years, while Michael Leapman from &quot;The Times&quot; declared the play to be worthless except for the final line, though he admitted he had never seen the television show. The play has occasionally been run at other theatres since.

===American adaptation===
In 1979, Garry Marshall, in the midst of success producing and directing &quot;Happy Days&quot; and its spin-offs, produced a pilot for an American version of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Beane&#x27;s of Boston&quot;, remaking the episode, &quot;German Week&quot; for the television pilot.

At the time, Americanised versions of British series, including &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; were doing well in the ratings, and Marshall hoped to capitalise on this with his script for the production.

Most of the characters were substantially similar to those of the UK version, with slight name changes in some instances. The one significant difference was that the Rumbold character was replaced by &quot;Franklin Beane&quot; (George O&#x27;Hanlon, Jr.), the young nephew of the proprietor who has recently been put in charge of the department.

Jeremy Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In&quot; partner, Alan Sues, was cast as Mr Humphries, a decision Lloyd regretted, saying Sues had been miscast.

Other cast included future &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; star John Hillerman as Mr Peacock, Charlotte Rae as Mrs Slocombe, Lorna Patterson as Miss Brahms, Tom Poston as Mr. Beane (the Mr. Grace equivalent), Larry Bishop as Mr. Lucas, Morgan Farley as Mr. Grainger, and Don Bexley as Mr. Johnson (the Mash/Harman role).

Ultimately, CBS passed on &quot;Beane&#x27;s of Boston&quot; and a full series was not produced.

===Australian adaptation===

An Australian adaptation, also called &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, ran for two series and sixteen episodes from 1980 to 1981 on Network Ten. It starred John Inman as Mr Humphries, who travels to Australia on loan from Grace Brothers to work for the Grace brothers&#x27; cousin, Mr Bone at his department store, Bone Brothers. The name Grace Brothers being the name of an actual department store chain founded in Sydney in 1885. Renamed versions of characters from the original series rounded out the cast including June Bronhill as Mrs Crawford, a copy of Mrs Slocombe, and Reg Gillam as Captain Wagstaff, a copy of Captain Peacock. Jeremy Lloyd adapted episodes for the show from his own scripts from the British &quot;Are You Being Served&quot;, drawing from the then-new episodes of the seventh series for series one of the Australian version, and a selection of older episodes for series two. Lloyd would later say he hated the process of adapting the episodes, which were mostly left intact with the exception of some topical jokes, which were changed or deleted.

===Dutch specials===
The TROS, the Dutch broadcaster that showed &quot;AYBS?&quot; in the Netherlands, invited over the key faces of the original cast twice to reprise their characters on Dutch television (albeit not for a full, half-hour episode). First in 1976, Dutch comedian André van Duin entered a shop and ran into Mr Humphries, Miss Brahms and Mrs Slocombe. A different special was made 1994, on the occasion of the 30 years jubilee of the TROS. This time, the search was for a replacement for Mrs Slocombe, with Mollie Sugden, John Inman, Frank Thornton, Wendy Richard, and Trevor Bannister all reprising their roles. In 1985 John Inman also assisted in character as co-presenter for a quiz.

==Reception==
The series gained much of its popularity with TV viewers by &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; through its deliberate-yet-subtle use of risqué visual gags, innuendo-infused dialogue and cleverly-disguised sophomoric humour. These comical devices also attracted some mild criticism, in part for relying on sexual stereotypes and double entendres – e.g., Mrs Slocombe discussing her cat (always referred to as her pussy): &quot;Animals are very psychic; the least sign of danger and my pussy&#x27;s hair stands on end.&quot;

John Inman&#x27;s portrayal of Humphries&#x27; over-the-top antics and sharp-tongued, witty responses, along with his trademark catch-phrase &quot;I&#x27;m free!&quot;, were enthusiastically embraced by many audience members, and the character evolved into a gay icon in popular culture. Despite this, Inman pointed out that Mr Humphries&#x27; true sexual orientation was never explicitly stated in the series, and David Croft said in an interview that the character was not homosexual, but &quot;just a mother&#x27;s boy&quot;. In an episode of the spin-off &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;, the character is further described as neither a &quot;woman&#x27;s man&quot; nor a &quot;man&#x27;s man&quot; and as being &quot;in limbo&quot;.

===International broadcasts===
The series was shown in the United States on PBS stations and on BBC America, as well as in many Commonwealth nations around the world. PBS first began airing it (on 24 stations) in 1987, and viewership steadily climbed as more stations carried it. By the early 1990s, it had gained such a loyal following that American viewers of the show formed fan clubs and were in large attendance wherever cast members made guest appearances.

&quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; aired in Canada in prime time on Global Television Network in the mid-1980s and late night on YTV. The show aired on Saturday evening prime time from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. It was also available to Canadian viewers from most border PBS stations in the United States.

The series was successfully screened in Australia. It began on ABC Television in 1974 and was repeated by ABC in Australia several times. By 1978, the rights to early episodes had been acquired by the commercial Seven Network who gained a larger audience than it had received on the ABC. &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; was ranked as the top-rated show on Australian television for 1978, being watched by 2,255,000 people in five cities. New episodes were aired on ABC until 1984. After that, the last series was broadcast on the Seven Network.

The entire series was screened in New Zealand on TVNZ.

==Merchandise==
Seven early episodes were novelised for a book, written by Jeremy Lloyd, called &quot;Are You Being Served? – Camping in and other Fiascos&quot;. This was written in 1976, and republished in 1997 by &quot;KQED Books&quot;. The seven episodes featured are &quot;Camping In&quot;, &quot;Up Captain Peacock&quot;, &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;, &quot;His and Hers&quot;, &quot;Coffee Morning&quot;, &quot;The Hand of Fate&quot; and &quot;The Clock&quot;.

In 1995, KQED Books published &quot;Are You Being Served – The Inside Story&quot; by Adrian Rigelsford, Anthony Brown, and Geoff Tibbals, with a foreword by Jeremy Lloyd, and sub-titled: &quot;The Inside Story of Britain&#x27;s Funniest – and Public Television&#x27;s Favorite – Comedy Series&quot;. In 212 pages, the book&#x27;s six chapters cover: The Cast of Characters, Behind the Scenes, The Episodes, The Spin-offs, Trivia Quiz, and Glossary. .

In 1998, Are You Being Served? 25 Years, a guide to the series was published by Orion Media. It was written by Richard Webber with David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. The book contains an introduction by the actress Joanna Lumley. The book is 176 pages.
In 1999, &quot;I&#x27;m Free! The Complete Are You Being Served?&quot;, a guide to the series, was published by Orion Books. It was written by Richard Webber, with contributions from David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. This book as stated on Amazon is 176 pages. It also contains the introduction by Joanna Lumley, so it is probably a reprint of the 25th year anniversary book. 

A board game was also produced in the 1970s. Players moved round a board resembling the shop floor to purchase one item from each of the four counters and leave the store, before their opponents and without going over budget.

===DVD releases===
All episodes exist in the BBC Archives. All ten series, as well as both series of &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; are now available on DVD in the UK (Region 2). The &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; film was released in 2002. A colour-restored version of the original pilot episode has yet to be released commercially but is available in the US to stream on BritBox.

All ten series, as well as both series of &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; (in packaging titled &quot;Are You Being Served? Again!&quot;) and the film are available on DVD in Region 1 (North America).

All ten series, as well as both series of &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; and the film have been released in Australia (Region 4).

A DVD titled &quot;Are You Being Served? – Best of The Early Years&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served? Christmas Specials&quot; have also been released.

<text>Aratus (; ; c. 315/310 240 BC) was a Greek didactic poet. His major extant work is his hexameter poem &quot;Phenomena&quot; (, &quot;Phainómena&quot;, &quot;Appearances&quot;; ), the first half of which is a verse setting of a lost work of the same name by Eudoxus of Cnidus. It describes the constellations and other celestial phenomena. The second half is called the &quot;Diosemeia&quot; (Διοσημεῖα &quot;Forecasts&quot;), and is chiefly about weather lore. Although Aratus was somewhat ignorant of Greek astronomy, his poem was very popular in the Greek and Roman world, as is proven by the large number of commentaries and Latin translations, some of which survive.

==Life==
There are several accounts of Aratus&#x27;s life by anonymous Greek writers, and the Suda and Eudocia also mention him. From these it appears that he was a native of Soli in Cilicia, (although one authority says Tarsus). He is known to have studied with Menecrates in Ephesus and Philitas in Cos. As a disciple of the Peripatetic philosopher Praxiphanes, in Athens, he met the Stoic philosopher Zeno, as well as Callimachus of Cyrene and Menedemus, the founder of the Eretrian school. He was the son of Athenodoros, and also had a brother with this name.

About 276 BC Aratus was invited to the court of the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas, whose victory over the Gauls in 277 Aratus set to verse. Here he wrote his most famous poem, &quot;Phenomena&quot;. He then spent some time at the court of Antiochus I Soter of Syria, but subsequently returned to Pella in Macedon, where he died sometime before 240/239. His chief pursuits were medicine (which is also said to have been his profession), grammar, and philosophy.

Several poetical works on various subjects, as well as a number of prose epistles, are attributed to Aratus, but none of them have come down to us, except his two astronomical poems in hexameter.
These have generally been joined as parts of the same work; but they seem to be distinct poems, the first, called &quot;Phenomena&quot; (&quot;Appearances&quot;), consists of 732 verses; the second, &quot;Diosemeia&quot; (&quot;On Weather Signs&quot;), of 422 verses.

===&quot;Phenomena&quot;===

The &quot;Phenomena&quot; appears to be based on two prose works—&quot;Phenomena&quot; and &quot;Enoptron&quot; (Ἔνοπτρον, &quot;Mirror&quot;, presumably a descriptive image of the heavens)—by Eudoxus of Cnidus, written about a century earlier. We are told by the biographers of Aratus that it was the desire of Antigonus to have them turned into verse, which gave rise to the &quot;Phenomena&quot; of Aratus; and it appears from the fragments of them preserved by Hipparchus, that Aratus has in fact versified, or closely imitated parts of them both, but especially of the first.

The purpose of the &quot;Phenomena&quot; is to give an introduction to the constellations, with the rules for their risings and settings; and of the circles of the sphere, amongst which the Milky Way is reckoned. The positions of the constellations, north of the ecliptic, are described by reference to the principal groups surrounding the north pole (Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, and Cepheus), whilst Orion serves as a point of departure for those to the south. The immobility of the Earth, and the revolution of the sky about a fixed axis are maintained; the path of the Sun in the zodiac is described; but the planets are introduced merely as bodies having a motion of their own, without any attempt to define their periods; nor is anything said about the Moon&#x27;s orbit. The opening of the poem asserts the dependence of all things upon Zeus. 

From the lack of precision in the descriptions, it would seem that Aratus was neither a mathematician nor observer or, at any rate, that in this work he did not aim at scientific accuracy. He not only represents the configurations of particular groups incorrectly, but describes some phenomena which are inconsistent with any one supposed latitude of the spectator, and others which could not coexist at any one epoch. These errors are partly to be attributed to Eudoxus himself, and partly to the way in which Aratus has used the materials supplied by him. Hipparchus (about a century later), who was a scientific astronomer and observer, has left a commentary upon the &quot;Phenomenas&quot; of Eudoxus and Aratus, accompanied by the discrepancies which he had noticed between his own observations and their descriptions.

==== Published editions ====

===&quot;Diosemeia&quot;===
The &quot;Diosemeia&quot; consists of forecasts of the weather from astronomical phenomena, with an account of its effects upon animals. It appears to be an imitation of Hesiod, and to have been imitated by Virgil in some parts of the &quot;Georgics&quot;.
The materials are said to be taken almost wholly from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorologica&quot;, from the work of Theophrastus, &quot;On Weather Signs&quot;, and from Hesiod. Nothing is said in either poem about Hellenistic astrology.

==Later influence==
The two poems were very popular both in the Greek and Roman world, as is proved by the number of commentaries and Latin translations. He enjoyed immense prestige among Hellenistic poets, including Theocritus, Callimachus and Leonidas of Tarentum. This assessment was picked up by Latin poets, including Ovid and Virgil. Latin versions were made by none other than Cicero (mostly extant), Ovid (only two short fragments remain), the member of the imperial Julio-Claudian dynasty Germanicus (extant, with scholia), and the less-famous Avienius (extant).
Quintilian was less enthusiastic.
Aratus was also cited by the author of Acts (believed to be Luke the Evangelist), in Acts 17:28, where he relates Saint Paul&#x27;s address on the Areopagus.
Paul, speaking of God, quotes the fifth line of Aratus&#x27;s &quot;Phenomena&quot; (Epimenides seems to be the source of the first part of Acts 17:28, although this is less clear):
Authors of twenty-seven commentaries are known; ones by Theon of Alexandria, Achilles Tatius and Hipparchus of Nicaea survive. An Arabic translation was commissioned in the ninth century by the Caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun. He is cited by Vitruvius, Stephanus of Byzantium and Stobaeus. Several accounts of his life are extant, by anonymous Greek writers.

The crater Aratus on the Moon and the minor planet 12152 Aratus are named in his honour.

<text>Yvelines ( ) is a department in the western part of the Île-de-France region in Northern France. In 2019, it had a population of 1,448,207. Its prefecture is Versailles, home to the Palace of Versailles, the principal residence of the King of France from 1682 until 1789, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. Yvelines&#x27; subprefectures are Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Mantes-la-Jolie and Rambouillet.

==History==
Yvelines was created from the western part of the former department of Seine-et-Oise on 1 January 1968 in accordance with a law passed on 10 January 1964 and a &quot;décret d&#x27;application&quot; (a decree specifying how a law should be enforced) from 26 February 1965. It inherited Seine-et-Oise&#x27;s official number of 78 since it took up the largest portion of its territory. In addition to this, it inherited Seine-et-Oise&#x27;s prefecture, Versailles.

Yvelines derives its name from the Forest of Yveline, next to Rambouillet.

It gained the communes of Châteaufort and Toussus-le-Noble from the adjacent department of Essonne in 1969.

The departmental capital, Versailles, which grew up around Louis XIV&#x27;s château, was also the French capital for more than a century under the Ancien Régime and again between 1871 and 1879 during the early years of the Third Republic. Since then the château has continued to welcome the French Parliament when it is called upon to sit in a congressional sitting (with both houses sitting together) in order to enact constitutional changes or to listen to a formal declaration by the President.

==Geography==
===Situation===
Yvelines is bordered by the departments of Val-d&#x27;Oise on the north, Hauts-de-Seine on the east, Essonne on the southeast, Eure-et-Loir on the southwest and Eure on the west.

The eastern part of the department, as well as its northern part along the Seine, is part of the Paris metropolitan area, but the rest of the department is rural, much of it covered by the Forest of Rambouillet (also known as the Forest of Yveline, from which the name of the department is derived).

Two regional parks can be found in Yvelines: Haute Vallée de Chevreuse Regional Natural Park and part of Vexin Français Park. Yvelines is home to one of France&#x27;s best known golf courses, La Tuilerie-Bignon, in the village of Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche.

===Principal towns===

Besides Versailles (the prefecture and most populous commune) and the subprefectures of Mantes-la-Jolie, Rambouillet, and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, important cities include Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Poissy, Les Mureaux, Houilles, Plaisir, Sartrouville, Chatou, Le Chesnay, and the new agglomeration community of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. As of 2019, there are 21 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants. The 10 most populous communes are:

==Demographics==
In French, a man from the Yvelines is called &quot;Yvelinois&quot; (plural &quot;Yvelinois&quot;); a woman is &quot;Yvelinoise&quot; (plural &quot;Yvelinoises).

<text>The Corinthian is a fictional character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;. He first appeared in &quot;The Sandman&quot; #10 (October 1989), which is part of the second story arc, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. The Corinthian is an anthropomorphized living nightmare created by Dream, who destroys him in the same collection for going rogue and failing to fulfill his original design. Dream later recreates him with &quot;some changes&quot;, though the exact nature of these changes is not explicit. His most notable physical feature is his lack of eyes: in their place, two rows of small, jagged teeth line each eye socket, which he often covers with sunglasses. He can speak, eat, see, and even breathe through these mouths.

Boyd Holbrook portrayed the Corinthian in the first season of the Netflix television series &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

==Abilities==
The first Corinthian claims excellent eyesight, and is shown driving a car even while wearing sunglasses at night. In the same volume, he is shown consuming the eyes of humans through his own socket/mouths, allowing him to view their memories and even see the future. The Corinthian is also able to embody himself in human beings, whereof the eyes are consumed and replaced by teeth and the hair of the victim turns white. During the process, the eye sockets bleed profusely; afterwards, he resembles his victim in most features and can impersonate it.

The second Corinthian resembles the first, but is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and seems fearless. He possess the ability to detect shapeshifters, shown when deducing Loki&#x27;s disguise quickly thanks to the memories of his predecessor of living among shifters within the dreaming. During his search for Daniel Hall, the Corinthian kills a supernatural wolf with his bare hands and later defeats Loki in single combat. He is also a skilled tracker able locate targets across cities and realms with relative ease. 

In 1999, Neil Gaiman stated that the Corinthian is homosexual in &quot;The Sandman Companion&quot;, wherein the first Corinthian consumed eyes only of boys. In 2022, he identified the Corinthian as pansexual in the Netflix TV series. &lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/neil-gaiman/693164015053127680/sir-as-i-could-see-youre-fond-of-giving-the&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The second Corinthian is featured with a boyfriend as written by Caitlin R. Kiernan in the Dreaming.

In &quot;The Sandman&quot; television series, the audience does not explicitly witness many of the Corinthian&#x27;s abilities. The Corinthian does consume eyes onscreen and receives a glimpse of the victim&#x27;s memories.

==Occurrences==
===&quot;The Sandman&quot;===
The Corinthian is AWOL from the dreamscape following Morpheus&#x27;s escape from capture, and masquerades as a serial killer who removes his victims&#x27; eyes; but Dream finds him shortly after saving Rose Walker. Here, Morpheus states that the Corinthian was &quot;… created to be the darkness, and the fear of darkness in every human heart. A black mirror, made to reflect everything about itself that humanity will not confront&quot;; but is deemed a failure for having done nothing other than gruesome murders, far short of Dream&#x27;s intent.

Corinthian is later drawn out by some serial killers to speak at their gathering disguised as a &quot;Cereal Convention&quot;. He did help to disposed of an imposter posing as the later serial killer &quot;The Boogeyman&quot;. During Corinthian&#x27;s speech, it is crashed by Dream. As punishment, Dream &quot;uncreates&quot; him, leaving a skull and some sand, and promises to improve upon him. Then he proceeds to remove the delusions from the serial killers present.

Dream recreates the Corinthian with some improvements in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, wherein the Corinthian helps rescue and protect Daniel. Though he doesn&#x27;t act like the previous version, Corinthian has the memories as the predecessor. In the process, he defeats Loki and eats his eyes, after Loki along with Puck was holding the child hostage.

===&quot;The Sandman Presents: The Corinthian&quot;===
A three-issue miniseries called &quot;The Corinthian: Death In Venice&quot; tells how the first Corinthian entered the waking world and learned to murder human beings. In the series, the Corinthian displays his talent for possessing the bodies of the living, a process which causes the possessed body&#x27;s hair to turn white and the eye sockets to bleed as the eyes are replaced (possibly eaten) by the Corinthian&#x27;s teeth. The story takes place in Venice, in the year 1920, and includes such tangential plot elements as police corruption and anti-communist paranoia. The story also features Charles Constantine (a member of the same infamous family as John Constantine), a World War I veteran who has repeatedly struggled with his inability to kill. During the war, Charles refuses to bayonet a helpless young German soldier named Stefan Wasserman. In retribution, Charles&#x27;s own commanding officer shoots Charles in the groin, castrating him, and shoots the young soldier in the head. Wasserman&#x27;s body, however, had been inhabited by the dormant spirit of the Corinthian, who has haunted and pursued Charles, both in dreams and in reality, ever since Wasserman, a victim of a severe shell shock resulting from Dream&#x27;s imprisonment, had committed suicide two years earlier.

The Corinthian wants someone to teach him &quot;how to kill&quot; and finds himself frustrated with Charles&#x27;s inability to do violence even in self-defense. He eventually develops a rapport with Charles&#x27;s traveling companion, a wealthy, traveling heiress who is degenerate and possibly insane. The woman claims that she cannot die, that she is the living incarnation of Pestilence, and refers to herself (and asks others to refer to her) by a new name each day, changing identities as she travels about. After she fatally shoots the Corinthian, and he survives by possessing the body of her young Italian lover, Amedeo, the woman recognizes the Corinthian as something other than human who can &quot;become someone else.&quot; The two form a pact in which the woman agrees to teach the Corinthian how to murder, and the Corinthian agrees to teach her how to &quot;stop being you.&quot;

The pivotal moment in the story comes while the characters are all attending the Venetian Carnival in costume. The woman, now calling herself Columbine, and the Corinthian Arlecchino murder another celebrant, but the Corinthian finds himself unable to take part, cursing himself. However, he eventually finds a way to fulfill both her promise to him and his promise to help the woman &quot;stop being [herself]&quot; by slitting her throat. Charles Constantine, happening upon them while dressed in his own carnival costume, finally steels himself and kills the Corinthian, who offers no resistance, with his own knife. The tale draws to a close with Charles leaving the country and the Corinthian beginning his murder spree, starting with Amedeo&#x27;s young lover and the policeman guarding her in jail.

===&quot;The Dreaming&quot;===
The new Corinthian is back again in &quot;The Dreaming&quot; spinoff, returning to earth for the three-part &quot;Souvenirs&quot; storyline. Later in the series he hunts down a transgender woman named Echo, who was previously a murderer who cut out the eyes of her victims, following the instructions of her boyfriend Gabriel who was one of the only surviving victims of the first Corinthian. A result of this is the accidental death of Matthew the Raven. As punishment, the Corinthian is turned into a mortal and Echo (made a cisgender female in the Dreaming) is given his position. As a mortal, he develops compassion for humans and comes to understand fear, especially after the death of his lover Sila. He is eventually deemed fit to come back and serve as the Corinthian, with Daniel Hall finding another place for Echo.

===&quot; Nightmare Country&quot;===
The second Corinthian continues his duties as humanity&#x27;s black mirror and has developed several methods to keep his more volatile impulses in check including keeping a record of the memories of his predecessor. During one of his haunts in a dream he encounters and is drawn into the mystery of the &quot;Smiling Man&quot; a rogue dream like entity outside of Dream&#x27;s control, who has a connection to several unexplained deaths. Discovering how widespread the Smiling Man has become he petitions Dream to allow him to re-enter the waking world and track the entity down with the aid of Maddison Flynn; a young woman who has had her connection to the Dreaming tampered with by unseen forces but has the power to see the Smiling Man in the waking world.

The pair follow a lead to a demonic night club where Azazel is working to harvest souls of unwary mortals in return for granting their hearts desires. One such victim being a young man named Max who is also seeing the Smiling Man. Azazel tempts the Corinthian to abandon Maddison by offering him a fragment of the original Corinthian that the demon had stolen from the Dreaming during his imprisonment after the events of Season of Mists. The demon claiming the fragment could break the restriction to kill that Morpheus had placed on him. While the Corinthian does go with the demon he seemingly remains concerned about Maddison&#x27;s well being.

At the nightclub the demon continues to tempt the Corinthian to kill and embrace his original self but, the nightmare refuses. When Azazel has to take care of some business he slips away and comes across the reanimated form of Maddison&#x27;s friend who is condemned to work at the club; tortured and mutilated at the hands of the depraved guests. He helps her treat some of her more severe injuries and the pair attempt an escape only to be caught by Max&#x27;s boss Mr Teaugue and his Angel companion. A creature the Corinthian quickly recognises as something other than an angel.

Their battle is interrupted by Dream who intercedes and removes the source of the nightclub&#x27;s power; a fragment of the original Dream that Azazael bit off in the events of Season of Mists. After taking back the power the group returns to the Dreaming where Dream ends Maddison and Corinthian&#x27;s investigation. Having concluded on his own that the Smiling Man is some ploy of Desire and Despair&#x27;s he removes the Corinthian&#x27;s memories of the ordeal and returns him to the Shores of Night to continues his duties. Unfortunately this leaves Maddison without protection and she is abducted by the Smiling Man who has somehow managed to enter the Dreaming.

===Other occurrences===
*An exact double of the Corinthian&#x27;s skull can be seen in the treasure chest of Daniel Hall during his brief &quot;Justice League of America&quot; occurrence. Dream placed the original Corinthian&#x27;s skull in his personal chest, then crafted a new skull before infusing it into the new Corinthian, and this is likely the source.
*The Corinthian makes a few brief but critical occurrences in &quot;Sandman Mystery Theater&quot;, where he is implied to be responsible for the mental derangement of some of the killers Wesley fights.

==Name==
The origin of the Corinthian&#x27;s name is unclear. In a later story arc of &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Puck politely refuses to ask whether his name is taken from &quot;the letters, the pillars, the leather, the place, or the mode of behavior.&quot; 
*&quot;The letters&quot; is a reference to the First (and second) Epistle to the Corinthians, which uses a phrase similar to &quot;dark mirror,&quot; as used by Dream to describe him.
*&quot;The pillars&quot; is a reference to Corinthian columns.
*&quot;The leather&quot; is referring to Corinthian leather.
*&quot;The place&quot; refers to Corinth, Greece.
*&quot;The mode of behavior&quot; (Corinthian behavior) is indulging in luxury and licentiousness.

In the &quot;Death In Venice&quot; miniseries, a beggar (who is not entirely reliable) claims that he exchanged one of his eyes for one offered to him by the Corinthian, and that he called him by the first thing he saw when he opened his new eye–a Corinthian pillar. Later in &quot;Death in Venice,&quot; the Corinthian refers to himself as &quot;the dream rot.&quot;

According to an interview with Gaiman in &quot;The Sandman Companion&quot;, the Corinthian takes his name from the mode of behavior; specifically, &quot;a Corinthian&quot; was another term for a rake: a devil-may-care, ne&#x27;er-do-well.

In the television series, the Corinthian is asked if the name refers to the Biblical Corinthians, the Greek Corinth, or the leather, to which he replies, &quot;Y&#x27;know, all of the above.&quot;

<text>Interstate 90 (I-90) is an east–west transcontinental freeway and the longest Interstate Highway in the United States at . It begins in Seattle, Washington, and travels through the Pacific Northwest, Mountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and the Northeast, ending in Boston, Massachusetts. The highway serves 13 states and has 15 auxiliary routes, primarily in major cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Rochester.

I-90 begins at Washington State Route 519 in Seattle and crosses the Cascade Range in Washington and the Rocky Mountains in Montana. It then traverses the northern Great Plains and travels southeast through Wisconsin and the Chicago area by following the southern shore of Lake Michigan. The freeway continues across Indiana and follows the shore of Lake Erie through Ohio and Pennsylvania to Buffalo. I-90 travels across New York by roughly following the historic Erie Canal and traverses Massachusetts, reaching its eastern terminus at Massachusetts Route 1A near Logan International Airport in Boston.

The freeway was established by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, replacing a series of existing U.S. highways that had been preceded by local roads and auto trails established in the early 20th century. I-90 was numbered in 1957, reflecting its status as the northernmost transcontinental route of the system, and construction was underway on several sections with funding from the Federal-Aid Highway Act.

The route also incorporates several toll roads that predate the Interstate Highway System, including the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Indiana Toll Road, Ohio Turnpike, New York State Thruway, and the Massachusetts Turnpike. These toll roads opened in the 1950s and were followed by toll-free sections in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that were finished in the 1960s. The Midwestern sections of I-90 were fully completed in 1978, and most of the route between Seattle and South Dakota opened by 1987. The final section, near the western terminus in Seattle, opened in September 1993; an eastern extension in Boston was completed in 2003 as part of the Big Dig project.

I-90 is the longest Interstate Highway in the United States, spanning across the northern portion of the coterminous part of the country. The transcontinental freeway passes through 13 states in the Pacific Northwest, Mountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and the Northeast regions of the United States. From the Wisconsin–Illinois state line to Massachusetts, approximately of I-90 uses turnpikes and other tolled highways with the exception of segments in Chicago, northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Albany, New York. The toll road sections comprise 25 percent of the freeway&#x27;s total length.

According to 2011 data from the Federal Highway Administration, the busiest section of I-90 is in the Chicago area, where a daily average of 306,574 vehicles use the freeway. The lowest daily traffic counts on I-90 were recorded in Wyoming, where an average of 9,820 vehicles used rural sections of the freeway.

===Washington===

The western terminus of I-90 is at an intersection with Washington State Route 519 and 4th Avenue South in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The junction is south of Downtown Seattle, adjacent to the Port of Seattle and two major sports stadiums, Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park. The freeway travels east through an interchange with I-5 and around Beacon Hill before it enters the Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel alongside the future 2 Line of the Link light rail system, set to open in 2025. I-90 emerges from the tunnel on a pair of floating bridges, among the longest of their kind: the eastbound-only Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, which carries westbound traffic and the future light rail line.

The floating bridges cross Lake Washington to Mercer Island, where I-90 travels through a series of tunnels under of parkland, including Aubrey Davis Park. The freeway continues from the island and enters Bellevue, the largest city of the Eastside region, and intersects I-405 near Factoria. I-90 then travels along Lake Sammamish and through Issaquah as it leaves the Seattle metropolitan area and ascends into the Cascade Range on the Mountains to Sound Greenway, a designated National Heritage Area and National Scenic Byway. The freeway crosses Snoqualmie Pass, elevation , at the crest of the mountain range near a ski resort.

From Snoqualmie Pass, I-90 follows the Yakima River into the Kittitas Valley and intersects I-82 in Ellensburg after a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 97 (US 97). The highway crosses the Columbia River on the Vantage Bridge and turns northeast to climb the cliffs of the Columbia Plateau near George. After traveling east across Moses Lake and the surrounding agricultural region, I-90 begins a long concurrency with US 395 at Ritzville as the highways turn northeast towards Spokane. I-90/US 395 is joined by US 2 through western Spokane, where it intersects US 195. The freeway crosses downtown Spokane on an elevated viaduct and splits from US 2 and US 395 to continue east across Spokane Valley towards the Idaho state line.

===Idaho===

I-90 traverses the Idaho Panhandle region at the north end of the state, where it connects Coeur d&#x27;Alene to communities in the Silver Valley. From the Washington state line, the freeway follows the Spokane River through Post Falls and Huetter to the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, where it intersects US 95, the state&#x27;s main north–south highway. I-90 then turns southeast to bypass Coeur d&#x27;Alene and travel along a series of ridges that face Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, crossing an arm of the lake on the Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge.

The freeway continues east across Fourth of July Summit and descends into the Silver Valley, where it follows the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River through several small towns along the historic Mullan Road. I-90 serves the cities of Kellogg and Wallace before it ascends into the Bitterroot Range and crosses Lookout Pass, which also marks the Montana state line.

===Montana===

Montana has the longest section of I-90, at almost , despite the highway only serving a portion of the state&#x27;s east–west width. It descends from Lookout Pass along the St. Regis and Clark Fork rivers between the foothills of the Bitteroot Range and Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains. The freeway travels east through the Alberton Gorge and crosses the Clark Fork River several times before it reaches the head of the Missoula Valley. After a short concurrency with US 93, I-90 runs along the north side of Missoula and joins US 12 to continue southeast along the foothills of the Garnet Range and Sapphire Mountains.

After it splits from US 12 in Garrison, the freeway turns south to traverse the Deer Lodge Valley. It then turns east to serve Butte, where it overlaps with I-15 for and intersects I-115. I-90 then continues southeast and crosses the Rocky Mountains and Continental Divide at Homestake Pass, which is the highest point on the entire Interstate at . The freeway travels east across the Jefferson Valley and passes the headwaters of the Missouri River near Three Forks. It then enters the Gallatin Valley.

I-90 travels around Bozeman, where it is joined by US 191, and crosses Bozeman Pass between the Bridger and Gallatin mountains. At the east end of the mountains, the freeway begins to follow the Yellowstone River and is briefly concurrent with US 89, which serves Yellowstone National Park, and splits from US 191 at Big Timber. I-90 continues along the Yellowstone River through Billings, overlapping with US 87 and US 212, until it reaches Lockwood, the western terminus of I-94. The freeways split and I-90 continues east across the Bighorn Basin before it turns south near Hardin to follow the Little Bighorn River into the Crow Indian Reservation. The highway passes the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn near Crow Agency and continues south along the river and the Wolf Mountains into Wyoming.

From 1995 to 1999, there was no numbered daytime speed limit on rural highways in Montana, including I-90. The speed limit was simply defined as &quot;reasonable and proper&quot; as determined on a case-by-case basis by the Montana Highway Patrol until the Montana Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional. The maximum daytime speed limit in Montana was initially set at in 1999 and was later raised to in 2015.

===Wyoming===

I-90 serves a portion of northeastern Wyoming that is primarily rural. The freeway, briefly concurrent to US 14, travels southeast along a series of creeks to Sheridan in the northeastern foothills of the Bighorn Mountains. I-90 and US 87 split in Sheridan and travel parallel to each other to Fort Phil Kearny, where they rejoin and continue south past Lake Desmet to Buffalo. The highways split again near Buffalo at a junction with I-25, which overlaps with US 87 to Casper.

From Buffalo, the highway turns east to cross the Powder River Basin, a region with several large coal mines. I-90 then reaches Gillette, where it begins a concurrency with US 14 and US 16 to a three-way split in Moorcroft. The freeway continues into the Bear Lodge Mountains (part of the Black Hills) and is rejoined in Sundance by US 14, which looped north to serve the Devils Tower. I-90/US 14 then continues northeast to Beulah, where it enters South Dakota.

===South Dakota===

I-90/US 14 enters South Dakota near Spearfish and travels east through prairie land, where it is briefly concurrent with US 85. Beyond Sturgis, the freeway turns south and follows the edge of the Black Hills to Rapid City, the gateway to Mount Rushmore. It then skirts the northern edge of Rapid City, which is served by spur route I-190, and passes Ellsworth Air Force Base while it continues east across the plains. I-90 splits from US 14 near Wall, home to the Wall Drug roadside attraction and located northeast of Badlands National Park.

The freeway travels southeast into the Buffalo Gap National Grassland and also passes a pair of decommissioned missile silos that form the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. I-90 continues east along the top of a plateau that faces the White River and passes near Kadoka and Murdo. US 83 briefly joins the highway from Murdo to Vivian, where it splits off to serve the state capital of Pierre. It then crosses the Missouri River on the Lewis and Clark Memorial Bridge near Chamberlain and passes a rest area which overlooks the river and includes the &quot;Dignity&quot; statue. From Chamberlain, I-90 continues east across the plains and past several small towns near the city of Mitchell. It then reaches the Sioux Falls area, where it bypasses the city to the north and intersects I-29 and I-229. I-90 leaves Sioux Falls and crosses into Minnesota near Brandon.

===Minnesota===

I-90 crosses the southern portion of Minnesota and carries unsigned Legislative Route 391 across the state. From the South Dakota border near Beaver Creek to Albert Lea, the freeway travels east across farmland and towns in the plains and rolling hills of the Buffalo Ridge. It also intersects several north–south highways, including US 75 in Luverne, US 59 in Worthington, US 71 in Jackson, and US 169 in Blue Earth. I-90 travels around the northern outskirts of Albert Lea and intersects I-35 northeast of the city. It then reaches Austin and a brief concurrency with US 218.

From Austin, the freeway turns northeast to head towards Rochester, which it bypasses to the south and intersects US 63 and US 52. I-90 continues east into the hilly Driftless Area and descends from the bluffs that overlook Lake Onalaska on the Mississippi River. It turns southeast at Dakota and is joined by US 14 until the highways split near La Crescent. I-90 turns east before it reaches La Crescent, where it crosses the Mississippi River on the Dresbach Bridge into Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===

I-90 enters Wisconsin near La Crosse and bisects French Island before it reaches Onalaska. This section is briefly concurrent to US 53 between La Crosse and Onalaska. The freeway travels east, generally along the La Crosse River, through several towns and Fort McCoy before it reaches a junction with I-94 in Tomah. The two Interstates join at Tomah and travel southeast along the edge of the hills of the Western Upland, following the Lemonweir and Wisconsin rivers. It passes Wisconsin Dells, situated on the gorge of the same name and home to several water parks and theme parks.

The freeway travels east from Wisconsin Dells to the Portage area, where I-39 begins its concurrency with I-90/I-94. The highway then crosses the Wisconsin River and travels south towards Madison, where it forms an eastern bypass of the city. East of Madison, I-94 separates from I-39/I-90, which continues southeast through Edgerton and Janesville. The highway turns south and enters Beloit, where it intersects I-43 and crosses into Illinois.

===Illinois===

I-90 uses several sections of the Illinois Tollway system as it traverses the northeastern corner of the state, primarily in the Chicago metropolitan area. It enters the state from Beloit, Wisconsin, and remains concurrent to I-39 and US 51 on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway through the eastern outskirts of Rockford, where the highways split off. I-90 continues on the tollway as it follows US 20 southeast through Belvidere and Elgin in the Fox Valley.

The tollway cuts through the northwestern suburbs of Chicago, where it intersects I-290 in Schaumburg and passes the north side of O&#x27;Hare International Airport. On the east side of the airport in Rosemont, I-90 intersects I-294 and I-190, the latter of which serves the airport&#x27;s passenger terminals and marks the end of the tollway. The freeway, now named the Kennedy Expressway, travels through northwestern Chicago, where the Blue Line of the &quot;L&quot; rapid transit system runs in the median and serves several stops. I-90 turns southeast and is rejoined by I-94 in Irving Park, where it gains a set of reversible express lanes that travel for toward the Near West Side.

The Kennedy Expressway travels south through the Near West Side, opposite the Chicago River from the Chicago Loop (the city&#x27;s central business district), and intersects I-290 again at the Jane Byrne Interchange. The freeway continues onto the Dan Ryan Expressway and crosses the Chicago River near Chinatown and an interchange with I-55. The Dan Ryan is the widest section of I-90, at 12 through lanes, and is split between local and express lanes. I-90/I-94 is joined by the &quot;L&quot; Red Line in the median of the expressway through the city&#x27;s South Side, where it passes Rate Field, the Illinois Institute of Technology campus, and Washington Park. I-90 splits from the Dan Ryan Expressway in Englewood and turns southeast onto the tolled Chicago Skyway. The tolled Skyway travels towards the Indiana state line, which the freeway crosses near the Calumet River in the East Side.

===Indiana===

The entirety of I-90 within Indiana is concurrent with the Indiana Toll Road, which crosses the state&#x27;s northern fringe and is mostly shared with I-80. From the Illinois state line, the tollway travels south through Hammond and turns east to follow the Grand Calumet River through northern Gary, where it intersects US 41 and US 12. I-90 then crosses I-65 in eastern Gary and I-94 in Lake Station, where it begins a concurrency with I-80.

I-94 travels northeast near the Lake Michigan shoreline from Lake Station to Michigan City, while the Indiana Toll Road (I-80/I-90) follows it to the south. The tollway then moves closer to the Michigan–Indiana state line and turns east, passing through the northern outskirts of South Bend and Elkhart. In South Bend, it intersects US 31 and passes near the University of Notre Dame. I-80/I-90 travels parallel to the state line until it reaches an interchange with I-69 near Fremont, where it turns southeast. The tollway then turns east and crosses the Ohio state line near Angola.

===Ohio===


At the state line near Montpelier, I-80/I-90 transitions from the Indiana Toll Road to the Ohio Turnpike, which crosses northern Ohio. The highway continues east around several rural towns as it approaches the Toledo area. The turnpike crosses under I-475 in Maumee without an interchange; access to I-475 is instead provided through a nearby junction with US 20. I-80/I-90 then continues southeast across the Maumee River to Rossford on the southern outskirts of Toledo, where it intersects I-75.

The turnpike travels southeast through a rural area near the southwest shore of Lake Erie, where it passes the cities of Fremont and Sandusky. Near Norwalk, the highway turns northeast to follow State Route 2 (SR 2) and heads to Elyria, where I-90 splits from I-80 (which remains on the turnpike). The freeway then merges with SR 2 and continues northeast through the lakeshore suburbs west of Cleveland, including Rocky River and Lakewood. I-90 and SR 2 separate after crossing the Rocky River and travel parallel to each other as they enter Cleveland. I-90 continues through the southwestern residential neighborhoods of Cleveland and reaches a junction with I-71 and I-490 in Tremont, where it turns north.

From Tremont, I-90 turns north onto the Innerbelt Freeway and crosses the Cuyahoga River into Downtown Cleveland on the George V. Voinovich Bridges. The Innerbelt skirts the south side of Downtown Cleveland, where it intersects I-77 near Progressive Field and turns north to bisect the Goodrich–Kirtland Park neighborhood. Near Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport, the freeway makes a sharp, 90-degree turn (nicknamed &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; for its frequent crashes) and rejoins SR 2 on the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway until they split again in Euclid. I-90 briefly turns southeast but resumes its northeastern route after a junction with I-271 in Willoughby Hills. The freeway travels parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline through farmland and exurban towns and crosses into Pennsylvania near Conneaut.

===Pennsylvania===
Within Pennsylvania, I-90 is non-tolled and generally travels northeast around several communities on the Lake Erie shoreline and remains entirely in Erie County. It enters the state in Springfield Township and passes through rural areas along the lake shore, parallel to US 20 and the Lake Road. The freeway then travels through the southern outskirts of Erie, where it intersects I-79 and US 19. I-90 returns to the rural areas of northeastern Erie County and intersects I-86 before it reaches the New York state line near the borough of North East. At , the Pennsylvania section is I-90&#x27;s shortest within a single state.

===New York===


I-90 enters New York in Chautauqua County and runs concurrently with the mainline of the tolled New York State Thruway. It travels northeast along the Lake Erie shoreline between Lake Road to the north and US 20 to the south through Dunkirk and Fredonia. The highways enter the Buffalo area, where the toll road runs north–south through Cheektowaga and forms an eastern bypass, using auxiliary routes I-190 and I-290 to serve the city. At a junction with I-290 near Buffalo Niagara International Airport, I-90 turns east to follow the historic Water Level Route of the New York Central Railroad, itself parallel to the 19th-century Erie Canal.

The Thruway passes south of Rochester, which it serves via a loop on I-490 and the direct north–south spur I-390. I-90 travels through the Finger Lakes region and moves closer to the Erie Canal as it approaches the Syracuse area. It travels through the city&#x27;s northern outskirts, where it intersects I-690, I-81, and I-481 from west to east. It then continues to Utica, where the Thruway runs along the north side of the Mohawk River (part of the Erie Canal). The section through Utica, connected to the city&#x27;s downtown via I-790, was built between the lines of SR 49, which does not merge with the Thruway.

I-90 then closely follows the Mohawk River southeast through several towns and villages between the foothills of the Catskill and Adirondack mountains. The Thruway then reaches Schenectady, which it bypasses to the southwest and intersects I-88 and I-890, the latter of which serves the city&#x27;s downtown. The highway continues southeast into Albany to a junction with I-87, where I-90 splits from the Thruway, which turns south to serve New York City. I-90 travels east as a toll-free freeway through the northern neighborhoods of Albany and intersects I-787 before it crosses the Hudson River. The freeway travels south around Rensselaer and rejoins the Thruway via the Berkshire Connector, which continues east into the Taconic Mountains toward the Massachusetts state line.

The mileposts and sequential exit numbers on the New York State Thruway mainline originate from New York City, increasing northward on I-87 and westward on I-90; as a result, the mileposts and exit numbers on I-90 through most of New York run backwards compared to the federal preference for mile-based numbers increasing from west to east. The Berkshire Connector uses west-to-east mileposts and exit numbers with a &quot;B&quot; prefix; the toll-free section of I-90 through Albany and Rensselaer uses conventional west-to-east mileposts and exit numbers despite being geographically north–south. I-90 is currently the only Interstate that has a complete set of nine spur routes within one state, all numbers being used. In addition, I-990, a short spur route near Buffalo that is not directly connected to I-90, is the highest number given to an Interstate.

===Massachusetts===

I-90 in Massachusetts is concurrent with the entirety of the Massachusetts Turnpike (also known as &quot;the Pike&quot; or &quot;MassPike&quot;). The turnpike begins at the New York state line in West Stockbridge and travels southeast through the Berkshires to the Pioneer Valley. The highway travels through the northern suburbs of Springfield, where it intersects I-91 and crosses the Connecticut River into Chicopee. I-90 then crosses over I-391 without an interchange and serves as the northern terminus of I-291 on the eastern outskirts of the city. The turnpike continues east through the hills of Central Massachusetts and serves as the eastern terminus of I-84 in the town of Sturbridge.

From Sturbridge, the turnpike travels northeast towards Worcester and passes through the city&#x27;s southern outskirts. It serves as the respective northern and western terminus of I-395 and I-290 in Auburn, located southwest of Worcester, and continues to an interchange with I-495 near Westborough at the edge of Greater Boston. I-90 travels through the western suburbs of Boston and travels through Framingham before it intersects I-95/Route 128, the main beltway around Boston, on the border of Weston and Newton. The turnpike continues along the Charles River into Boston, where it descends into a tunnel that passes Boston University, Fenway Park, and under the Prudential Tower complex in the Back Bay neighborhood.

I-90 intersects I-93 on the south side of Downtown Boston and travels under the Fort Point Channel to serve the Seaport District. The turnpike then enters the Ted Williams Tunnel, which travels northeast under Boston Harbor to the passenger terminals at Logan International Airport. After it passes the northwest side of the airport, I-90 terminates at an interchange with Route 1A in East Boston. The section between I-93 and the airport was opened in the early 2000s as part of the Big Dig megaproject, which rebuilt several Boston freeways and extended I-90 by .

==History==

===Predecessors and establishment===

An east–west controlled access highway to serve the Northern United States was proposed in the early 20th century in several federal government documents, including reports from the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1930s and 1940s. The Interstate Highway System was created by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which was approved by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on June 26, 1956. I-90 was assigned to the northernmost transcontinental route in the system by the American Association of State Highway Officials in 1957.

The freeway would travel along existing parts of the United States Numbered Highway System, which was established at the suggestion of the federal government in 1926 to replace the named auto trails. Among these auto trails, which were generally designated by private motorist organizations, were the transcontinental Yellowstone Trail and National Parks Highway, created in the 1910s along the future route of I-90 between Seattle and Boston. The national numbered highways along the corridor included US 10 from Seattle to Billings, Montana; US 87 from Billings to Buffalo, Wyoming; US 16 from Buffalo to Portage, Wisconsin; US 51 from Portage to Rockford, Illinois and US 20 from Rockford to Boston.

===Tollways and urban construction===
Major portions of I-90 in the Midwest and Northeastern states used existing toll roads built by state governments in the 1950s and 1960s. The Northwest Tollway, Chicago Skyway, Indiana Toll Road, Ohio Turnpike, New York State Thruway, and Massachusetts Turnpike all predate I-90 and were incorporated into the route. This also meant that portions of the route did not adhere to Interstate Highway standards, but they were either deemed adequate or rebuilt to conform by the 1980s. The Pennsylvania section was planned in the early 1950s as the &quot;Erie Extension&quot; of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but was instead completed as a toll-free road in October 1960 with federal funds. The completion of the section also allowed for full use of the New York State Thruway, which had been finished three years earlier but ended abruptly at the state line.

I-90 would use several expressways and tollways in the Chicago area, the earliest of which was the Tri-State Expressway (now the Kingery Expressway), completed in 1950 and extended into Indiana the following year. It was followed by the Congress Expressway in the western suburbs, first opened in 1955, and the Northwest Tollway in 1958. The last section to be completed in Illinois was the toll-free Dan Ryan Expressway, which opened on December 15, 1962, and was described as the &quot;world&#x27;s widest freeway&quot; at the time. In 1965, the designation for I-90 was switched with I-94 south of Chicago, which moved it to the tolled Chicago Skyway (completed in 1958); the change was requested by the Illinois and Indiana state governments to avoid confusion and provide a continuous toll connection to the Indiana Toll Road, which had been fully opened in 1956. I-90 was moved onto the Kennedy Expressway in 1977 and its western route was replaced with I-290 from Schaumburg to the Circle Interchange in Chicago.

The other tolled sections of I-90 were completed in the 1950s by their respective state governments. The Ohio Turnpike opened to traffic on October 1, 1955, three years after construction began. The first segment of the New York Thruway opened in June 1954 and was followed by extensions to Buffalo and the Albany area by the end of the year. It was extended to the Pennsylvania state line in 1957 and to the Massachusetts Turnpike via the Berkshire Connector in 1959. The Berkshire section linked with the Massachusetts Turnpike, which had opened in 1957 from the state line to Newton, a distance of . The turnpike was extended into Boston in two stages: first by from Newton to Allston in September 1964; and finally with an extension to I-93 near South Station in Downtown Boston that opened on February 18, 1965.

===Non-tolled construction===
The freeway also incorporated other non-tolled expressway bypasses planned by state governments in the early 1950s and modified to meet Interstate standards. A bypass of Spokane Valley, Washington, opened in November 1956 as the first section in Washington and was extended into neighboring Spokane two years later. Wisconsin opened their first section in November 1959, connecting the terminus of the Illinois Tollway with Janesville, and extended the freeway through the Madison area to Wisconsin Dells in 1962. The Cleveland Innerbelt opened in stages from 1959 to 1962 and was originally planned to connect with the Parma Freeway, which would have carried I-90 around the northwest side of Downtown Cleveland. It was later cancelled in the 1960s amid public opposition. The first Minnesota section, built to bypass Austin, began construction in 1957 and opened in 1961.

Wisconsin was among the first states to complete its rural Interstate system and opened its final section of I-90, from La Crosse to Tomah, in November 1969. The section around Albany, New York, built as a toll-free alternative to the New York Thruway, was completed in 1976 with a connection to the Berkshire Connector, which had been originally intended to carry the I-90 designation across the Hudson River. South Dakota completed its final section in November 1976, which created an unbroken stretch of four-lane highway from the Wyoming state line to Boston but some intersections remained. The Minnesota segment of I-90 was declared complete in September 1978 with a dedication at Blue Earth, where a golden line was painted to emulate the golden spike of the first transcontinental railroad. Two months later, Ohio finished its last section west of Cleveland.

The western states were the last to complete their segments of I-90. Wyoming opened its final section, from the Montana state line to Sheridan, in July 1985 and dedicated it three months later following the completion of Montana&#x27;s cross-border section. The last two-lane section in Montana, near Springdale, was widened to four lanes in May 1987. One of the last rural sections of I-90 to be built was through Wallace, Idaho, which placed its downtown on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 to prevent its demolition for the freeway. The elevated freeway bypassed Wallace to the north and cost $42 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) to construct. It opened on September 5, 1991, and the city ceremonially retired the last stoplight on I-90 a week later. The Idaho section was declared fully complete in July 1992 after the Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge opened near Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

===Completion and later projects===
Washington was the last state to complete its section of I-90, primarily due to disputes and litigation over the Seattle–Bellevue section. The Snoqualmie Pass section was completed in 1981 with a viaduct for westbound traffic that stands over Denny Creek. The viaduct replaced an earlier plan for a ground-level freeway at the behest of environmentalists; the Mountains to Sound Greenway was established in 1990 along the corridor between Seattle and Thorp to preserve wilderness and recreational areas and was designated as a National Scenic Byway in 1998, a first for an Interstate Highway. The extension into Seattle was completed in stages between 1989 and 1993 and cost $1.56 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct. The project involved construction of a new floating bridge, expansion of the Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel, addition of lids with parks, and extensive mitigation for environmental and social impacts. The project was originally planned to be completed in 1992, but was delayed a year due to the sinking of the original floating bridge during renovations in November 1990; the bridge was rebuilt and opened for eastbound traffic on September 12, 1993.

Extensions at both termini of I-90 were completed in the early 2000s as part of separate projects. The west end at Washington State Route 519 in Seattle was rebuilt as a series of ramps near Safeco Field (now T-Mobile Park) to replace an existing intersection. A component of the Big Dig megaproject in Boston that extended I-90 east by under Fort Point Channel and Boston Harbor to Logan International Airport opened on January 18, 2003, at a cost of $6.5 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars). The Fort Point Channel tunnel later closed in July 2006 due to a ceiling panel collapse that killed one person. It reopened in January 2007 after repairs and retrofit work.

Other sections of I-90 have been rebuilt or replaced to accommodate modern needs and meet updated safety standards. The Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago was reconstructed over a two-year period from 2006 to 2007 at a cost of $975 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), adding auxiliary lanes and improved bridges. The section carried over 300,000 daily vehicles prior to the project. Cleveland&#x27;s Innerbelt Bridge, which carried I-90 over the Cuyahoga River, was replaced with the George V. Voinovich Bridges, which opened in November 2013 for westbound traffic and September 2016 for eastbound traffic. The old bridge was imploded with explosives on July 12, 2014, and dismantled by the end of the year. The states of Minnesota and Wisconsin replaced the Dresbach Bridge over the Mississippi River in 2016; the project was spearheaded by Minnesota following the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapse in 2007.

==Names and designations==
I-90 carries several commemorative names designated by state governments, some of which are shared between multiple states. Washington and Minnesota designated their sections as the &quot;American Veterans Memorial Highway&quot;. In the states of Idaho, Montana, and South Dakota, I-90 is part of the Purple Heart Trail, which honors Purple Heart recipients. In Wisconsin, I-90 and I-94 were designated as the Wisconsin Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987. From Lorain, Ohio, through Pennsylvania and New York, I-90 is officially designated as the &quot;AMVETS Memorial Highway&quot;.

<doc id="89869" wikidata="Q1141837" url="?curid=89869" title="Circular saw">
<text>A circular saw or a buzz saw, is a power-saw using a toothed or abrasive disc or blade to cut different materials using a rotary motion spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a circular saw. &quot;Circular saws&quot; may also be loosely used for the blade itself. Circular saws were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States by the middle of the 19th century.

A circular saw is a tool for cutting many materials such as wood, masonry, plastic, or metal and may be hand-held or mounted to a machine. In woodworking the term &quot;circular saw&quot; refers specifically to the hand-held type and the table saw and chop saw are other common forms of circular saws. &quot;Skilsaw&quot; and &quot;Skil saw&quot; have become generic trademarks for conventional hand-held circular saws in the United States of America. Circular saw blades are specially designed for each particular material they are intended to cut and in cutting wood are specifically designed for making rip-cuts, cross-cuts, or a combination of both. Circular saws are commonly powered by electricity, but may be powered by a gasoline engine or a hydraulic motor which allows it to be fastened to heavy equipment, eliminating the need for a separate energy source.

==History==
There is evidence for the prehistorical use of circular saws by people of Indus Valley Civilization during the Bronze Age. The same was excavated from the archeological site of Lothal, Gujarat.

The modern-day circular saw was invented around the end of the 18th century as a rip-saw to convert logs into lumber in sawmills and various claims have been made as to who invented it. Before the design was invented, logs were sawn by hand using a pit saw or using powered saws in a sawmill using an &quot;up-and-down&quot; saw with a reciprocating motion. The rotary nature of the circular saw requires more power to operate but cuts faster because the teeth are in constant motion. The sound of the circular saw is different from the sound of an up-and-down saw and earned it the nickname &quot;buzz-saw&quot;.

Sawmills first used smaller diameter circular saws to resaw dimension lumber such as lath and wall studs and for edging boards. As the technology advanced large diameter saw blades began to be used for the head saws and to cut clapboards.

Claims to the invention of the circular saw include:
* A common claim is for a little-known sailmaker named Samuel Miller of Southampton, England who obtained a patent in 1777 for a saw windmill. However, the specification for this only mentions the form of the saw incidentally, indicating that it was probably not his invention.
* Gervinus of Germany is often credited with inventing the circular saw in 1780.
* Walter Taylor of Southampton had the blockmaking contract for Portsmouth Dockyard. In about 1762, he built a saw mill where he roughed out the blocks. This was replaced by another mill in 1781. Descriptions of his machinery there in the 1790s show that he had circular saws. Taylor patented two other improvements to blockmaking but not the circular saw. This suggests either that he did not invent it or that he published his invention without patenting it (which would mean it was no longer patentable).
* Another claim is that it originated in the Netherlands in the sixteenth or seventeenth century.
* The use of a large circular saw in a saw mill is said to have been invented in 1813 by Tabitha Babbitt, a Shaker inventor, after she noted the inefficiency of the traditional saw pits used by the sawyers in her community and sought an improvement. This claim is now mostly discredited.
* The Barringer, Manners and Wallis factory in Rock Valley, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire also claims to be the site of the invention.

==Process==
Typically, the material to be cut is securely clamped or held in a vise, and the saw is advanced slowly across it. In variants such as the table saw, the saw is fixed and the material to be cut is slowly moved into the saw blade. As each tooth in the blade strikes the material, it makes a small chip. The teeth guide the chip out of the workpiece, preventing it from binding the blade.

===Characteristics===
* Cutting is by teeth on the edge of a metal blade or by an abrasive wheel
* The cut has narrow kerf and relatively smooth surface finish
* Cuts are straight and relatively accurate
* The saw usually leaves burrs on the cut edge of metal and plastic (which should then be addressed with sand paper)
* Saw setting should be done geometrically

==Types of circular saws==
In addition to hand-held circular saws (see below), different saws that use circular saw blades include:
* Abrasive saw
* Biscuit joiner
* Brushcutter
* Carbide saws
* Cold saw

==Sawmill blades==
Originally, circular saws in mills had smaller blades and were used to resaw lumber after it passed through an &quot;up and down&quot; (muley or sash) saw leaving both vertical and circular saw marks on different sides of the same piece. These saws made it more efficient to cut small pieces such as lath.
After 1813 or 1822 saw mills use large circular saws, up to in diameter. Large saws demand more power than up-and-down saws and did not become practical for sawing timbers until they were powered by steam engines. They are either left or right-handed, depending on which side of the blade the plank falls away from. Benching determines which hand the saw is. Saws of this size typically have a shear pin hole, off axis, that breaks if the saw is overloaded and allows the saw to spin free. The most common version is the ITCO (insert tooth cut-off) which has replaceable teeth. Sawmill blades are also used as an alternative to a radial arm saw.

==Cordwood saws==

Cordwood saws, also called buzz saws in some locales, use blade of a similar size to sawmills. Where a sawmill rips (cuts with the grain) a cordwood saw crosscuts (cuts across the grain). Cordwood saws can have a blade from to more than diameter depending on the power source and intended purpose. Cordwood saws are used to cut logs and slabs (sawmill waste) into firewood. The cubic meter and Cord (unit) are common measurements of standing timber (by estimation) or rough logs. &quot;Cordwood&quot; means unsplit logs long. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, farmers would supply householders in town with cordwood, which would then be re-sawn and split to a length and circumference suitable for woodburning heaters and ranges. Almost all these devices were designed to accept sticks, conveniently a piece of cordwood cut into three equal lengths. Once a piece of cordwood had been re-sawn to three 16-inch pieces, it could easily be split to stovewood size with an ax.

Most cordwood saws consist of a frame, blade, mandrel, cradle, and power source. The cradle is a tilting or sliding guide that holds logs during the cutting process. Certain cordwood saws are run from a belt from a farm tractor power takeoff pulley. Others, mounted on a tractor&#x27;s three-point hitch, connect to the rear power takeoff shaft. Self-powered models are equipped with small gasoline engines or even large electric motors as power sources. The mandrel is a shaft and set of bearings that support and transfer power to the blade. The frame is a structure that supports the cradle and blade at a convenient working height.

Cordwood saws were once very popular in rural America. They were used to cut smaller wood into firewood in an era when hand powered saws were the only other option. Logs too large for a cordwood saw were still cut by hand. Chainsaws have largely replaced cordwood saws for firewood preparation today. Still, some commercial firewood processors and others use cordwood saws to save wear and tear on their chainsaws. Most people consider cordwood saws unsafe and outdated technology.

==Hand-held circular saws for wood==

In woodworking the term circular saw is most commonly used to refer to a hand-held, electric circular saw designed for cutting wood, but may be used for cutting other materials with different blades. Circular saws can be either left or right-handed, depending on the side of the blade where the motor sits. A left-handed saw is typically easier to use if held in the right hand, and contrariwise for the right-handed saw, because the user does not need to lean across the saw to see the cutting line.

Blades for cutting wood are almost universally tungsten carbide tipped (TCT), but high-speed steel (HSS) blades are also available. The saw base can be adjusted for depth of cut and can tilt up to 45° and sometimes 50° in relation to the blade. Adjusting the depth of cut helps minimize kickback. Different diameter blades are matched to each saw and are available ranging from .

Saws can have two different types of linkages between the motor and the blade. In the type known colloquially as a &quot;sidewinder&quot;, the blade is mounted directly on the motor&#x27;s driveshaft. In a &quot;worm-drive&quot; saw, the blade is driven by a perpendicularly mounted motor using worm gears, which give higher torque.

The worm-drive portable circular saw was invented in 1923 by Edmond Michel. In 1924 Michel formed a partnership with Joseph Sullivan, and together they started the Michel Electric Handsaw Company, with the sole purpose of manufacturing and marketing the saw invented by Michel. The company later renamed itself Skilsaw Inc. Portable circular saws are often still called Skilsaws or Skil saws. Its successor is still sold by Skil as the model 77. To get around the Skil patents, Art Emmons of Porter-Cable invented the direct-drive sidewinder saw in 1928. Recently smaller cordless circular saws with rechargeable batteries have become popular.

==Cold saw for metal==

Cold saw machines are circular saws that are used in many metal cutting operations. The saw blades used are quite large in diameter and operate at low rotational speeds, and linear feeds. There are three common types of blades used in circular saws; solid-tooth, segmental tooth, and the carbide inserted-tooth. The circular saw is typically fed into the workpiece horizontally, and as the saw advances into the material, it severs the material by producing narrow slots. The material is usually held in place during the cutting operation by means of a vise. The chips produced by cutting are carried away from the material by both the teeth of the blade as well as the coolant or other cutting fluid used.

==Abrasive saws==

The rotary motion of a circular saw lends itself to cutting hard materials like concrete, asphalt, metal, tile, brick, and stone with an abrasive saw such as a tile saw. Diamond blades and cut off wheels are commonly used in these applications.

<doc id="89871" wikidata="Q12563" url="?curid=89871" title="Landes (department)">
<text>Landes (; ; ) is a department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, Southwestern France, with a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It also borders Gers to the east, Pyrénées-Atlantiques to the south, Lot-et-Garonne to the north-east, and Gironde to the north. Located on the Atlantic coast, it had a population of 413,690 as of 2019. Its prefecture is Mont-de-Marsan.

The department is the second-largest department in France and it covers the Forest of Landes. The southwestern part of the department is part of the wider conurbation of Biarritz and Bayonne across the Pyrénées-Atlantique border.

==History==
Landes is one of the original 83 departments that were created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the provinces of Guyenne and Gascony.

During the first part of the 19th century, large parts of the department were covered with poorly drained heathland (); this is the origin of the department&#x27;s name. The vegetation covered rich soil and was periodically burned off, leaving excellent pasturage for sheep, which around 1850 are thought to have numbered between 900,000 and 1,000,000 in this area. The sheep were managed by shepherds who moved around on stilts and became proficient at covering long distances thus supported. Most of the sheep departed during the second half of the nineteenth century when systematic development of large pine plantations transformed the landscape and the local economy.

One of the most famous citizens of the Landes was the 19th-century French economist Frédéric Bastiat.

The Nobel Prize–winning novelist François Mauriac set his novels in the Landes.

==Geography==
The Landes is part of the current region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. With an area stretching over more than 9000 km2, Landes is, after Gironde, the second largest department of the metropolitan French territory.

It is well known for the Côte d&#x27;Argent beach. Côte d&#x27;Argent is Europe&#x27;s longest beach, and attracts many surfers to Mimizan and Soorts-Hossegor each year. It is also home to a château called Château de Gaujacq that was built in 1686.

==Demographics==
Population development since 1801:
===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Mont-de-Marsan, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Landes===
The president of the Departmental Council has been Xavier Fortinon of the Socialist Party since 2017. He succeeded former president of the National Assembly Henri Emmanuelli upon his death.

===National representation===
In the 2024 legislative election, Landes elected the following members of the National Assembly:

In the Senate, Landes is represented by two members: Éric Kerrouche and Monique Lubin. Both have served since the 2017 Senate election.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
Landes is known for its large pine forest which is the raw material for a timber and resin industries in the region. The forest was planted in the early nineteenth century to prevent erosion of the region&#x27;s sandy soil by the sea.

===Tourism===
Landes is famous for its seaside resorts and natural spots, such as:

<text>The Phalanx CIWS () is an automated gun-based close-in weapon system to defend military watercraft automatically against incoming threats such as aircraft, missiles, and small boats. It was designed and manufactured by the General Dynamics Corporation, Pomona Division, later a part of Raytheon. Consisting of a radar-guided Vulcan cannon mounted on a swiveling base, the Phalanx has been used by the United States Navy and the naval forces of 15 other countries. The U.S. Navy deploys it on every class of surface combat ship, except the and . Other users include the British Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, and the U.S. Coast Guard.
A land variant, the LPWS (Land Phalanx Weapon System), part of the Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, was developed. It was deployed to counter rocket, artillery and mortar attacks during the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The U.S. Navy also fields the SeaRAM system, which pairs the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile with sensors based on the Phalanx.

==History==
The Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) was developed as the last line of automated weapons defense (terminal defense or point defense) against all incoming threats, including antiship missiles (AShMs or ASMs), aircraft including high-g and maneuvering sea-skimmers, and small boats.

The first prototype system was offered to the U.S. Navy for evaluation on the destroyer leader in 1973 and it was determined that further work was required to improve performance and reliability. Subsequently, the Phalanx Operational Suitability Model successfully completed its Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) on board the destroyer in 1977. The model exceeded operational maintenance, reliability, and availability specifications. Another evaluation successfully followed, and the weapon system was approved for production in 1978. Phalanx production started with orders for 23 USN and 14 foreign military systems. The first ship fully fitted out was the aircraft carrier in 1980. The Navy began placing CIWS systems on non-combatant vessels in 1984.

==Design==

The basis of the system is the 20 mm M61 Vulcan rotary cannon, used by the United States military on various tactical aircraft since 1959, linked to a Ku band fire control radar system for acquiring and tracking targets. This proven system was combined with a purpose-made mounting, capable of fast elevation and traverse speeds, to track incoming targets. An entirely self-contained unit, the mounting houses the gun, an automated fire-control system and all other major components, enabling it to automatically search for, detect, track, engage, and confirm kills using its computer-controlled radar system. Owing to this self-contained nature, Phalanx is ideal for support ships, which lack integrated targeting systems and generally have limited sensors. The entire unit has a mass between .

Because of their distinctive barrel-shaped radome and their automated operation, Phalanx CIWS units are sometimes nicknamed &quot;R2-D2&quot; after the droid from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

===Upgrades===
The Phalanx system has been developed through several configurations. The basic (original) is the Block 0, equipped with first-generation, solid-state electronics and with marginal capability against surface targets. The Block 1 (1988) upgrade improved radar, ammunition, computing power, rate of fire, and an increase in maximum engagement elevation to +70 degrees. These improvements were intended to increase the system&#x27;s capability against emerging Russian supersonic anti-ship missiles. Block 1A introduced a new computer system to counter more maneuverable targets. The Block 1B PSuM (Phalanx Surface Mode, 1999) adds a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor to make the weapon effective against surface targets. This addition was developed to provide ship defense against small vessel threats and other &quot;floaters&quot; in littoral waters and to improve the weapon&#x27;s performance against slower low-flying aircraft. The FLIR&#x27;s capability is also of use against low-observability missiles and can be linked with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) system to increase RAM engagement range and accuracy. The Block 1B also allows for an operator to visually identify and target threats.

Since the end of FY 2015, the US Navy has upgraded all Phalanx systems to the Block 1B variant. In addition to the FLIR sensor, the Block 1B incorporates an automatic acquisition video tracker, optimized gun barrels (OGB), and Enhanced Lethality Cartridges (ELC) for additional capabilities against asymmetric threats such as small maneuvering surface craft, slow-flying fixed and rotary-winged aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The FLIR sensor improves performance against anti-ship cruise missiles, while the OGB and ELC provide tighter dispersion and increased &quot;first-hit&quot; range; the Mk 244 ELC is specifically designed to penetrate anti-ship missiles with a 48 percent heavier tungsten penetrator round and an aluminum nose piece. Another system upgrade is the Phalanx 1B Baseline 2 radar to improve detection performance, increase reliability, and reduce maintenance. It also has a surface mode to track, detect, and destroy threats closer to the water&#x27;s surface, increasing the ability to defend against fast-attack boats and low-flying missiles. As of 2019, the Baseline 2 radar upgrade has been installed on all U.S. Navy Phalanx system-equipped vessels. The Block 1B is also used by other navies, such as Canada, Portugal, Japan, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UK.
In April 2017, Raytheon tested a new electric gun for the Phalanx allowing the system to fire at varying rates to conserve ammunition. The new design replaces the pneumatic motor, compressor, and storage tanks, reducing system weight by while increasing reliability and reducing operating costs.

==Operation==
The CIWS is designed to be the last line of defense against anti-ship missiles. Due to its design criteria, its effective range is very short relative to the range of modern ASMs, from . The gun mount moves at a very high speed and with great precision. The system takes minimal inputs from the ship, making it capable of functioning despite potential damage to the ship.

The only inputs required for operation are 440V AC three-phase electric power at 60Hz and water (for electronics cooling). For full operation, including some nonessential functions, it also has inputs for ship&#x27;s true compass heading and 115V AC for the WinPASS subsystem. WinPASS (Windows-based Parameter Analysis and Storage Subsystem) is a secondary computer built into the local control station that allows technicians to perform various tests on system hardware and software for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes. It also stores data from any engagements the system conducts so that it can later be analyzed.

===Radar subsystems===
The CIWS has two antennas that work together to engage targets. The first antenna, for searching, is located inside the radome on the weapon control group (top of the white-painted portion). The search subsystem provides bearing, range, velocity, heading, and altitude information of potential targets to the CIWS computer. This information is analyzed to determine whether the detected object should be engaged by the CIWS system. Once the computer identifies a valid target (see details below), the mount moves to face the target and then hands the target over to the tracking antenna at around . The track antenna is extremely precise, but views a much smaller area. The tracking subsystem observes the target until the computer determines that the probability of a successful hit is maximized and then, depending on the operator conditions, the system either fires automatically at around or recommends fire to the operator. While firing 75 rounds per second, the system tracks outgoing rounds and &#x27;walks&#x27; them onto the target.

===Gun and ammunition handling system===
The Block 0 CIWS mounts (hydraulic driven) fired at a rate of 3,000 rounds per minute and held 989 rounds in the magazine drum. The Block 1 CIWS mounts (hydraulic) also fired at 3,000 rounds per minute with an extended magazine drum holding 1,550 rounds. The Block 1A and newer (pneumatic driven) CIWS mounts fire at a rate of 4,500 rounds per minute with a 1,550-round magazine. The velocity of the rounds fired is about . The rounds are armor-piercing tungsten penetrator rounds or depleted uranium with discardable plastic sabots. The Phalanx CIWS 20 mm rounds are designed to destroy a missile&#x27;s airframe and make it non-aerodynamic, thus keeping shrapnel from the exploding projectile to a minimum, effectively keeping secondary damage to a minimum. The ammunition handling system has two conveyor belt systems. The first takes the rounds out of the magazine drum to the gun; the second takes empty shells or unfired rounds to the opposite end of the drum.

The 20 mm APDS rounds consist of a penetrator encased in a plastic sabot and a lightweight metal pusher. Rounds fired by the Phalanx cost around $30 each and the gun typically fires 100 or more when engaging a target.

===CIWS contact target identification===
The CIWS does not recognize identification friend or foe, also known as IFF. The CIWS has only the data it collects in real time from the radars to decide if the target is a threat and to engage it. A contact must meet multiple criteria for the CIWS to consider it a target. These criteria include:

# Is the range of the target increasing or decreasing in relation to the ship? The CIWS search radar sees contacts that are out-bound and discards them. The CIWS engages a target only if it is approaching the ship.
# Is the contact capable of maneuvering to hit the ship? If a contact is not heading directly at the ship, the CIWS looks at its heading in relation to the ship and its velocity. It then decides if the contact can still perform a maneuver to hit the ship.
# Is the contact traveling between the minimum and maximum velocities? The CIWS has the ability to engage targets that travel in a wide range of speeds; however, it is not an infinitely wide range. The system has a target maximum-velocity limit. If a target exceeds this velocity, the CIWS does not engage it. It also has a target minimum-velocity limit, and does not engage any contact below that velocity. The operator can adjust the minimum and maximum limits within the limits of the system.

There are many other subsystems that together ensure proper operation, such as environmental control, transmitter, mount movement control, power control and distribution, and so on. It takes six to eight months to train a technician to maintain, operate, and repair the CIWS.

==Incidents==

===Drone exercise accidents===
On 10 February 1983, was conducting a live-fire exercise off the East Coast of the United States using the Phalanx against a target drone. Although the drone was successfully engaged at close range, the debris of the destroyed target bounced off the sea surface and struck the ship, causing significant damage and fire from the drone&#x27;s residual fuel and killing a civilian instructor aboard the ship.

On 13 October 1989, was conducting a live-fire exercise off the East Coast of the United States using the Phalanx against a target drone. The drone was successfully engaged, but as the drone fell to the sea, the CIWS re-engaged it as a continued threat to &quot;El Paso&quot;. Rounds from the Phalanx struck the bridge of , killing one officer and injuring a petty officer.

===Iran–Iraq War===
On 17 May 1987, during the Iran–Iraq War, which the US was observing as a non-combatant, an Iraqi Dassault Mirage F1 fighter fired two Exocet missiles at what was deemed to be a suitable target, but was the American frigate .

The Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode and the Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed, as no attack had been expected. Both missiles struck the port side of the ship near the bridge. 37 United States Navy personnel were killed and 21 wounded. Iraq apologized and paid compensation for this unintentional attack.

=== Iraqi missile attack in 1991 Gulf War ===
On 25 February 1991, during the first Gulf War, the Phalanx-equipped frigate was a few miles from the U.S. Navy battleship and the Royal Navy destroyer . An Iraqi missile battery fired two Silkworm anti-ship missiles (often referred to as the &quot;Seersucker&quot;); &quot;Missouri&quot; responded by firing its SRBOC chaff countermeasures. The Phalanx system on &quot;Jarrett&quot;, operating in automatic target-acquisition mode, fixed on &quot;Missouri&quot;″s chaff and fired a burst of rounds, of which four hit &quot;Missouri&quot;, from &quot;Jarrett&quot; at the time. There were no injuries on &quot;Missouri&quot;, and the Iraqi missiles were destroyed by Sea Dart missiles fired by &quot;Gloucester&quot;.

===Pearl Harbor accidental discharge===
On May 5, 1994, the port side Phalanx on board the USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; accidentally fired two depleted uranium rounds while the ship was at its berth at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Sailors were conducting a firing circuit test as part of routine maintenance on the CIWS system at the time. A Judge Advocate General investigation concluded that required CIWS pre and post-firing inspections had not been properly conducted and the rounds had gone undetected in the ammunition drive. It is believed by the Navy that the rounds fell in an undeveloped mountainous area near Aiea, HI. There were no reports of any injuries or property damage as a result of the accidental discharge.

===Accidental shoot-down of US aircraft by Japanese ship===
On 4 June 1996, a Phalanx operated by the JMSDF accidentally shot down a US A-6 Intruder from the aircraft carrier that was towing a radar target during gunnery exercises about west of the main Hawaiian island of Oahu. The locked onto the Intruder instead of the target, or tracked up the tow cable after acquiring the towed target. The aircraft&#x27;s two-man crew ejected safely. A post-accident investigation concluded that &quot;Yūgiri&quot;″s gunnery officer gave the order to fire before the A-6 was out of the CIWS engagement envelope.

=== Red Sea crisis ===

On 30 January 2024, Houthis fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward the Red Sea. The missile came within a mile of the USS &quot;Gravely&quot;. The Phalanx CIWS aboard &quot;Gravely&quot; was used to shoot down the missile. This was the first time the Phalanx CIWS was used to down a Houthi-fired missile. No damage or injuries were reported.

==Centurion C-RAM==

Seeking a solution to continual rocket and mortar attacks on bases in Iraq, the U.S. Army requested a quick-to-field antiprojectile system in May 2004, as part of its Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar initiative. The result of this program was the &quot;Centurion&quot;. For all intents and purposes a terrestrial version of the Navy&#x27;s CIWS, the Centurion was rapidly developed, with a proof-of-concept test in November that same year. Deployment to Iraq began in 2005, where it was set up to protect forward operating bases and other high-value sites in and around the capital, Baghdad. Israel purchased a single system for testing purposes, and was reported to have considered buying the system to counter rocket attacks and defend point military installations. However, the swift and effective development and performance of Israel&#x27;s indigenous Iron dome system has ruled out any purchase or deployment of Centurion.
Each system consists of a modified Phalanx 1B CIWS, powered by an attached generator and mounted on a trailer for mobility. Including the same 20 mm M61A1 Gatling gun, the unit is likewise capable of firing 4,500 20 mm rounds per minute. In 2008, there were more than 20 C-RAM systems protecting bases in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. A Raytheon spokesman told the &quot;Navy Times&quot; that 105 attacks were defeated by the systems, most of them involving mortars. Based on the success of Centurion, 23 additional systems were ordered in September 2008.

Like the naval (1B) version, Centurion uses Ku-band radar and FLIR to detect and track incoming projectiles, and is also capable of engaging surface targets, with the system able to reach a minus-25-degree elevation. The Centurion is reportedly capable of defending a area. One major difference between the land- and sea-based variants is the choice of ammunition. Whereas naval Phalanx systems fire tungsten armor-piercing rounds, the C-RAM uses the 20 mm HEIT-SD (High-Explosive Incendiary Tracer, Self-Destruct) ammunition, originally developed for the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System. These rounds explode if they impact a target, but if they miss they self-destruct on tracer burnout, greatly reducing the risk of collateral damage from misses.

<text>Douai (; ; ; ; ; formerly spelled Douay or Doway in English) is a city in the Nord département in northern France. It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Located on the river Scarpe some from Lille and from Arras, Douai is home to one of the region&#x27;s most impressive belfries.

==History==
Its site probably corresponds to that of a 4th-century Roman fortress known as Duacum. From the 10th century, the town was a romance fiefdom of the counts of Flanders. The town became a flourishing textile market centre during the Middle Ages, historically known as Douay or Doway in English. In 1384, the county of Flanders passed into the domains of the Dukes of Burgundy and thence in 1477 into Habsburg possessions.

In 1667, Douai was taken by the troops of Louis XIV of France, and by the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the town was ceded to France. During successive sieges from 1710 to 1712, Douai was almost completely destroyed by the British Army. By 1713, the town was fully integrated into France. Douai became the seat of the Parliament of Flanders (fr).

The local airfield at La Brayelle was very significant in the history of French aviation. It operated from 1907 to the mid-1950s. In 1909 it was the site of the world&#x27;s first aeronautical meeting,

Douai was again caught up in hostilities in World War I. when for much of the war it was occupied by the Germans. La Brayelle airfield was a base of Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. Later in 1918, the town was partly burned, and was liberated by the British Army after the Battle of Courtrai.

The Douaihy family of Lebanon claims descent from inhabitants of the city who settled in Lebanon during the Crusades.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Douai has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Douai is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Douai was on 25 July 2019; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 8 January 1985.

==Main sites==
Douai&#x27;s ornate Gothic-style belfry was begun in 1380, on the site of an earlier tower. The 80 m high structure includes an impressive carillon, consisting of 62 bells spanning 5 octaves. The originals, some dating from 1391, were removed in 1917 during World War I by the occupying German forces, who intended to melt them down for the metal. They were reinstalled after repairs in 1924, but 47 of them were replaced in 1954 to obtain a better sound. An additional larger bell in the summit, a La called &quot;Joyeuse&quot;, dates from 1471 and weighs 5.5 tonnes. The chimes are rung by a mechanism every quarter-hour, but are also played via a keyboard on Saturday mornings and at certain other times. In 2005 the belfry was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a part of the Belfries of Belgium and France site, in recognition of its architecture and importance in the history of municipal power in France. The belfry forms part of the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) complex.

The substantial &quot;Porte de Valenciennes&quot; town gate, a reminder of the town&#x27;s past military importance, was built in 1453. One face is built in Gothic style, while the other is of Classical design.

==Economy==
Douai&#x27;s main industries are in the chemical and metal engineering sectors.

Since 1970, Renault has a large automobile assembly line nearby, called Usine Georges Besse after assassinated CEO Georges Besse. It produced vehicles such as the R14, R11, R19, Mégane and Scénic. Following industry changes, it now makes electric cars.

The Gare de Douai railway station is served by regional trains to Lille, Arras, Lens, Amiens, Saint-Quentin and Valenciennes. It connects to the TGV network, with high speed trains to Paris, Lyon, Nantes and other places.

== University==
The University of Douai was founded under the patronage of Phillip II when Douai belonged to the Spanish Netherlands.

It was prominent, from the 1560s until the French Revolution, as a centre for the education of English Catholics escaping persecution in England. Connected with the University were not only the English College, Douai, founded by William Allen, but also the Irish and Scots Colleges and the Benedictine, Franciscan and Jesuit houses. Throughout Europe, there were around 800 such seminaries. They prepared Jesuits for missionary work in England, with 60 migrating in the 1570s, and around 500 by 1603. The first Jesuits were Edmund Campion and Robert Parsons.

The Benedictine priory of St Gregory the Great was founded by Saint John Roberts at Douai in 1605, with a handful of exiled English Benedictines who had entered various monasteries in Spain, as the first house after the Reformation to begin conventual life. The community was established within the English Benedictine Congregation and started a college for English Catholic boys unable to find a Catholic education at home, and pursued studies at the University of Douai. The community was expelled at the time of the French Revolution in 1793 and, after some years of wandering, finally settled at Downside Abbey, Somerset, in 1814.

Another English Benedictine community, the Priory of St. Edmund, which had been formed in Paris in 1615 by Dom Gabriel Gifford, later Archbishop of Rheims and primate of France, was expelled from Paris during the Revolution, and eventually took over the vacant buildings of the community of St Gregory&#x27;s in 1818. Later, following Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s Law of Associations (1901), this community also returned to England in 1903, where it was established at Douai Abbey, near Reading. Douai School continued as an educational establishment for boys until 1999.

In 1609 the English College published a translation of the Old Testament, which, together with the New Testament published at Rheims 27 years earlier, was the Douay–Rheims Bible used by Anglophone Roman Catholics almost exclusively for more than 300 years.

For a time there was a Carthusian monastery (charterhouse) in Douai, which is now the Musée de la Chartreuse de Douai.

<text>Interstate 94 (I-94) is an east–west Interstate Highway connecting the Great Lakes and northern Great Plains regions of the United States. Its western terminus is just east of Billings, Montana, at a junction with I-90; its eastern terminus is in Port Huron, Michigan, where it meets with I-69 and crosses the Blue Water Bridge into Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, where the route becomes Ontario Highway 402. It thus lies along the primary overland route from Seattle (via I-90) to Toronto (via Ontario Highway 401) and is the only east–west Interstate Highway to have a direct connection to Canada. It is the longest Interstate whose route number is not divisible by 5.

I-94 intersects with I-90 several times: at its western terminus; Tomah to Madison in Wisconsin; in Chicago, Illinois; and in Lake Station, Indiana. Major cities that I-94 connects to are Billings, Bismarck, Fargo, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Madison, Milwaukee, Chicago, and Detroit.

=== Montana ===

I-94 begins at Billings and travels northeastward toward Glendive before exiting the state to the east. I-94 links seven counties, which are Yellowstone, Treasure, Rosebud, Custer, Prairie, Dawson, and Wibaux counties and passes near or through Miles City and Glendive while connecting with I-90 in Billings. The highway is notable for following the Yellowstone River from Billings through Glendive. Beyond the western terminus of I-94, I-90 connects westbound I-94 travelers to points west such as Butte; Missoula; Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho; Spokane, Washington; and Seattle, Washington.

=== North Dakota ===

The route enters at Beach and passes through the Badlands near Medora (near the Theodore Roosevelt National Park South Unit). Further east, I-94 provides access to the North Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, then passes through the cities of Dickinson, Mandan, Bismarck, Jamestown, and Valley City on the way to West Fargo and Fargo, where it leaves the state and crosses into Minnesota. Throughout the state, the route generally travels relatively straight east and west following both the railroad route and the former route of US Route 10 (US 10, called &quot;The Old Red Trail&quot;) where its western terminus is at exit 343 in West Fargo.

The highway intersects with the Enchanted Highway east of Dickinson at exit 72. At New Salem, it passes Salem Sue, a sculpture of a Holstein cow and is clearly visible from I-94 on the south side of the road. A drive up the road to Sue will take visitors to a vantage point where they can see a panoramic landscape for many miles. Between Mandan and Bismarck, I-94 crosses the Missouri River with a view of the Northern Pacific/BNSF Railway Bridge on the south side of the road. At Steele, it passes the world&#x27;s largest sculpture of a sandhill crane (named Sandy), which is tall and visible from I-94 on the south side of the road, just to the east of exit 200. At Jamestown, it passes the world&#x27;s largest sculpture of the buffalo (actually bison) named &quot;Dakota Thunder&quot;, which is tall and is visible from I-94 on the north side of the road. US 52 is concurrent with I-94 from Jamestown to the Minnesota state line. approximately milemarker 275 on the westbound lanes between Jamestown and Valley City, there is a small green sign marking the Laurentian Divide, which marks a continental divide where rivers south of the divide drain into the Gulf of Mexico, while the rivers north flow into the Arctic Ocean. The highway reaches Fargo, before the Red River.

=== Minnesota ===

Leaving Fargo and entering Moorhead, Minnesota, I-94/US 52 crosses the Red River. East of Moorhead Municipal Airport, the Interstate travels in a northwest–southeast trajectory past Fergus Falls, Alexandria, and St. Cloud on the way to the Twin Cities and eastward out of the state.

The road crosses the Mississippi River in Minneapolis between the Prospect Park and Seward neighborhoods. As it crosses over the only true gorge along the Mississippi&#x27;s entire length, where steep bluffs extend to the waterline. The highway joins Minneapolis and Saint Paul together where it meets Minnesota State Highway 280 (MN 280). US 52 leaves I-94 after running concurrently with I-94 from the North Dakota state line and heads southbound toward Rochester. In the Twin Cities, the routing of the highway is politically charged, primarily through many historic working-class and Black neighborhoods. In Saint Paul, the routing of I-94 is set through and displaces the historic Rondo neighborhood, which prior to the highway construction was the largest Black community in Saint Paul.

East of Saint Paul, I-94 leaves Minnesota between Lakeland, Minnesota, and Hudson, Wisconsin, while crossing the St. Croix River.

=== Wisconsin ===

I-94 enters Wisconsin east of the Twin Cities at Hudson. It traverses the hilly terrain of northwest Wisconsin, crossing the Red Cedar River near Menomonie. East of Menomonie, I-94 junctions with WIS 29, a major East–West expressway connecting I-94 with Wausau, and Green Bay. It then passes Eau Claire before turning southeastward and joining with I-90 in Tomah. Southeast of Tomah, the highway passes the major tourist area of Wisconsin Dells. Here, vacationers can find a multitude of water parks, camping, amusement parks, zoos, river excursions, as well as lodging and shopping. Further southeast, I-94 joins up with I-39 in Portage at the base of Cascade Mountain, a popular ski area. Just south of Cascade Mountain, I-94 crosses over the Wisconsin River. I-94 leaves I-90 and I-39 east of the state capitol of Madison and resumes its easterly path toward Milwaukee. I-94 weaves its way into Downtown Milwaukee before turning south and heading to Chicago, entering Illinois at Pleasant Prairie.

=== Illinois ===
In the state of Illinois, I-94 runs south from Wisconsin to Indiana via downtown Chicago. It is tolled on the Tri-State Tollway to the I-94/I-294 split; it then runs east to the Edens Expressway, where it soon joins again with I-90 on the Kennedy Expressway and turns south through the city of Chicago. I-90 leaves south of downtown Chicago to the Chicago Skyway. At I-80, I-94 runs east to Indiana on the Kingery Expressway.

=== Indiana ===
In the state of Indiana, I-94 runs east from Illinois concurrently with I-80. It crosses I-90 (Indiana Toll Road), where I-80 joins I-90 east toward Ohio. I-94 continues northeasterly, paralleling the Lake Michigan shoreline into Michigan. The speed limit used to continue east of exit 26; now it ends east of I-80/I-90, where the speed limit goes up to on eastbound I-94. Between milemarkers 0.0 and 15.5, the highway is also posted along with I-80. Between milemarkers 15.6 and 19.0, I-94 is posted alone.

=== Michigan ===

I-94 runs north along Lake Michigan to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor where it meets US 31 and I-196 before heading east toward Detroit. It turns northeast to Port Huron where it meets I-69 and ends at the Blue Water Bridge, where it becomes Ontario Highway 402 in Point Edward, Ontario.

== History ==
The first section of I-94 completed with Interstate funds (under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956) was a section between Jamestown and Valley City, North Dakota, in 1958.

North of Chicago, I-94 has been widened from six to eight lanes from Illinois Route 22 (IL 22, Half Day Road) to just south of the Wisconsin state line at IL 173 and 95th Street to 159th Street. Construction began in 2009 to completely rebuild I-94, including expansion to eight lanes, from the Wisconsin–Illinois border through the Mitchell Interchange in Milwaukee. This construction is expected to be completed in 2021.

In 2005, the I-94 bridge over the Crow River near St. Michael, Minnesota, about northwest of Minneapolis, was rebuilt. In 2006, a project to widen I-94 east of Downtown Saint Paul between MN 120 and McKnight Road from four to six lanes was completed. The interchange at 95th Avenue North in Maple Grove, Minnesota, was rebuilt with a new, wider bridge that replaced the two-lane bridge there, which was demolished in July 2006.

The expanded Marquette Interchange in Downtown Milwaukee was completed in August 2008 at a cost of $810 million (equivalent to $ in ).

In Detroit, I-94 was routed over the existing Edsel Ford Freeway and remained signed as such until the late 1980s when Michigan deemphasized proper names on Interstate guide signs. Its interchange with the Lodge Freeway, built in 1953, is significant as the first full-speed freeway-to-freeway interchange built in the US.

From September 2007 to October 2008, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) added a temporary extra lane to I-94 between northbound I-35W and Minnesota State Highway 280 in the Twin Cities to help relieve traffic congestion caused by the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge. As a result, this portion of I-94 was not up to Interstate Highway standards during this time period.

<text>Brian Lumley (2 December 1937 – 2 January 2024) was an English author of horror fiction. He came to prominence in the 1970s writing in the Cthulhu Mythos created by American writer H. P. Lovecraft but featuring the new character Titus Crow, and went on to greater fame in the 1980s with the best-selling &quot;Necroscope&quot; series, initially centered on character Harry Keogh, who can communicate with the spirits of the dead.

==Biography==
Born in County Durham, he joined the British Army&#x27;s Royal Military Police and wrote stories in his spare time before retiring with the rank of Warrant Officer Class 1 in 1980 and becoming a professional writer.

In the 1970s he added to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos cycle of stories, including several tales and a novel featuring the character Titus Crow. Several of his early books were published by Arkham House. Other stories pastiched Lovecraft&#x27;s Dream Cycle but featured Lumley&#x27;s original characters David Hero and Eldin the Wanderer. Lumley once explained the difference between his Cthulhu Mythos characters and Lovecraft&#x27;s: &quot;My guys fight back. Also, they like to have a laugh along the way.&quot;

Later works included the &quot;Necroscope&quot; series of novels, which produced spin-off series such as the &quot;Vampire World Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Lost Years&quot; parts 1 and 2, and the &quot;E-Branch&quot; trilogy. The central protagonist of the earlier &quot;Necroscope&quot; novels appears in the anthology &quot;Harry Keogh and Other Weird Heroes&quot;. The last entry in the &quot;Necroscope&quot; saga is &quot;The Mobius Murders&quot;.

Lumley served as president of the Horror Writers Association from 1996 to 1997. On 28 March 2010 Lumley was awarded Lifetime Achievement Award of the Horror Writers Association. He also received a World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2010.

Lumley died on 2 January 2024, at the age of 86.

==Inspiration==
Lumley&#x27;s list of his favourite horror stories – &quot;not complete by any means and by no means in order of preference&quot; – included M. R. James&#x27; &quot;Count Magnus&quot;, Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Black Stone&quot;, Robert W. Chambers&#x27; &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; from &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;The Voice in the Night&quot;, and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;.

==Bibliography==
This is a list of Lumley&#x27;s more notable novels and short story collections. This list of novels and short stories is not exhaustive. Lumley had many pieces published in periodicals and other publications, sometimes as works in progress or partial works, under his own name and jointly with other writers.

<text>The Green Lantern Corps is a fictional intergalactic law enforcement agency and superhero team appearing in comics published by DC Comics. They patrol the farthest reaches of the DC Universe at the behest of the Guardians, a race of immortals residing on the planet Oa. According to DC continuity, the Green Lantern Corps have been in existence for three billion years. Currently operating amongst the 3600 &quot;sectors&quot; of the universe, there are 7204 members (known commonly as Green Lanterns). Each Green Lantern is given a power ring, a weapon granting the use of incredible abilities that are directed by the wearer&#x27;s own willpower.

==Publication history==
In 1959, during a revival of the popularity of superhero comics in America, DC Comics&#x27; editor Julius Schwartz decided to reinvent the 1940s superhero character Green Lantern as a science fiction hero. Schwartz&#x27;s new conception of Green Lantern had a different name (Hal Jordan), costume, and origin story, and no connection to the original Green Lantern. Whereas the Green Lantern of the 1940s was a lone vigilante who only had adventures on Earth, the new Green Lantern was but one of a group of interstellar lawmen who all called themselves Green Lanterns. The group is first mentioned in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (1960) when a dying Green Lantern passes on his ring to Hal Jordan. Over the years, writers have introduced a large cast of Green Lanterns in both supporting and starring roles.

==In other media==
===Television===

* The Green Lantern Corps made an appearance in the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; episode &quot;The Green Loontern&quot;. Besides Hal Jordan, the featured Green Lantern Corps members are Amanita, Arisia, Boodikka, Breeon, Brokk, Ch&#x27;p, Chaselon, Galius Zed, Green Lambkin, Guy Gardner, G&#x27;nort, Hannu, John Stewart, Katma Tui, Kilowog, K&#x27;ryssma, Larvox, M&#x27;Dahna, Medphyll, NautKeLoi, Penelops, Salakk, Stel, Tomar-Re, and Xax. After Duck Dodgers accidentally takes Hal Jordan&#x27;s uniform from the dry cleaners due to a mix-up, he is teleported to the Corps location by the power ring, where they are in a fight with Sinestro&#x27;s robots. During the fight, Sinestro kidnaps the entire Green Lantern Corps to act as a power source for a doomsday device. Duck Dodgers manages to save them (more through accident than skill) before giving the uniform back to Hal Jordan and being stranded in Sinestro&#x27;s hideout as Hal Jordan and the rest of the Corps take their leave.

* The Green Lantern Corps appear in series set in the DC animated universe:

** The Green Lantern Corps appear in the &quot;Justice League&quot; episodes &quot;In Blackest Night&quot; and &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;.
** The Green Lantern Corps appear in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;The Return&quot;.

When they confront Amazo after Lex Luthor and Atom reasoned with them, Amazo stated that he actually moved Oa to another dimension as he returns Oa back to its original position.
* The Green Lantern Corps appear in &quot;&quot;. In the teaser of &quot;Day of the Dark Knight!&quot;, the Corps is having lunch in the cafeteria, and force Guy Gardner to clean up his mess. In &quot;The Eyes of Despero!&quot;, they fight against Despero, and Hal Jordan hides them in his ring for protection.
* The Green Lantern Corps is the primary focus of &quot;Green Lantern: The Animated Series&quot;, with Hal Jordan and Kilowog as the main cast. Also in the show are &quot;frontier space&quot; members of the corps.
* Within the Arrowverse, during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover event, footage from the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; film was used to establish the existence of the Green Lantern Corps within the universe of Earth-12.
** The series finale of &quot;Arrow&quot;, titled &quot;Fadeout&quot;, ends with main character John Diggle / Spartan approaching what appears to be a Green Lantern ring that has fallen from the sky, suggesting that he will become a Green Lantern. In the eighth season of &quot;The Flash&quot;, Diggle makes the choice to relinquish the Green Lantern ring to be with his family.

===Film===
* The Green Lantern Corps feature prominently in the Warner Brothers animated film &quot;Green Lantern: First Flight&quot;. The film follows the origins of Hal Jordan and Sinestro.
* The Green Lantern Corps is the focus of a following film, &quot;Green Lantern: Emerald Knights&quot;, which features several stories about various non-Terran Green Lanterns.
* The Green Lantern Corps appear in the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; live-action film. The leader of the Corps is Sinestro, with Abin Sur, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re being central characters.
* In &quot;Justice League vs. the Fatal Five&quot;, Jessica Cruz, Kilowog, and Salaak appear as representatives of the Corps. Holographic depictions of most of the Lantern Corps&#x27; human members – Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, and Cruz – also appear as part of a Justice League exhibit in the Legion of Super-Heroes Museum.
* The Green Lantern Corps appear in the films set in the DC Extended Universe:
** A character named Carrie Farris appears in the live-action films &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, played by Christina Wren. She is a United States Air Force officer attached to the operations of United States Northern Command and the assistant to General Swanwick. Carrie Farris is a nod and allusion to Carol Ferris.
** Green Lantern Yalan Gur appears in a flashback in the &quot;Justice League&quot; film. He is seen fighting against Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons but is overpowered and killed by Steppenwolf as his power ring flies off. Early in production, a deleted scene which was filmed as another post-credits scene depicting Kilowog and Tomar-Re visiting Bruce Wayne / Batman would have further teased &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot;; but the scene was scrapped.
*** In the Snyder cut of the film, Yalan Gur took part in the battle against Darkseid&#x27;s forces. Darkseid behands Yalan Gur before killing him as his power ring flies off.

Jordan is among the heroes decimated by Paradooms (hybrids of the Parademons and Doomsday), while other Lanterns and the Guardians are slaughtered by Darkseid himself on Oa.
* The Green Lantern Corps appear in &quot;Green Lantern: Beware My Power&quot;. Before the film&#x27;s main events, the Green Lantern Corps are revealed to have been slaughtered by Sinestro and a Parallax-possessed Hal Jordan (the latter had also taken the fallen Lanterns&#x27; rings to achieve his full potential). After the Sinestro Corps are defeated, Jordan&#x27;s successor John Stewart eventually takes Jordan&#x27;s rings and sends them to their new owners to rebuild the Corps.

Additionally, Sonya Blade&#x27;s in-game ending depicts her becoming the Green Lantern of the Mortal Kombat universe after gaining the ring of a recently deceased Corps member.
* In &quot;&quot;, Kilowog and Atrocitus make cameo appearances. The Corps also appear in Green Lantern&#x27;s victory pose. At the end of the game, the main universe&#x27;s Hal Jordan brings the parallel universe&#x27;s version of himself, who had joined the Sinestro Corps during Year Two, and Sinestro to the remaining Guardians of the Universe at Oa for trial with a Green Lantern at the center of the court.

<doc id="89889" wikidata="Q212850" url="?curid=89889" title="Saint Vitus">
<text>Vitus (), whose name is sometimes rendered Guy or Guido, was a Christian martyr from Sicily. His surviving hagiography is pure legend. The dates of his actual life are unknown. He has for long been tied to the Sicilian martyrs Modestus and Crescentia but in the earliest sources it is clear that these were originally different traditions that later became combined. The figures of Modestus and Crescentia are probably fictitious.

According to his hagiography, he died during the Diocletianic Persecution in AD 303. In the Middle Ages, he was counted as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. In Germany, his feast was celebrated with dancing before his statue. This dancing became popular and the name &quot;Saint Vitus Dance&quot; was given to the neurological disorder Sydenham&#x27;s chorea. It also led to Vitus being considered the patron saint of dancers and of entertainers in general. He is also said to protect against lightning strikes, animal attacks and oversleeping. His feast day is celebrated on 15 June. In places where the Julian calendar is used, this date coincides, in the 20th and 21st centuries, with 28 June on the Gregorian calendar.

==Martyrdom==
According to the hagiography, Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia were martyrs under Diocletian. The earliest testimony for their veneration is offered by the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; (ed. G. B. de Rossi-Louis Duchesne, 78: &quot;In Sicilia, Viti, Modesti et Crescentiae&quot;). The fact that the note is in the three most important manuscripts indicates that it was also in the common exemplar of these, which appeared in the fifth century. The same &quot;Martyrologium&quot; has under the same day another mention of a Vitus at the head of a list of nine martyrs, with the statement of the place, in Eboli, &quot;In Lucania&quot;, that is, in the Roman province of that name in southern Italy between the Tuscan Sea and the Gulf of Taranto. It is easily possible that it is the same martyr Vitus in both cases.

According to J. P. Kirsch, the testimony to the public veneration of the three saints in the fifth century proves that they are historical martyrs. There are, nevertheless, no historical accounts of them, nor of the time or the details of their martyrdom.

During the sixth and seventh centuries a purely legendary narrative of their martyrdom appeared which appears to be based upon other legends, especially on the legend of Potitus, and ornamented with accounts of fantastic miracles. According to this legend, Vitus was a 7-year-old son of a senator of Lucania (some versions make him 12 years old). He resisted his father&#x27;s attempts, which included various forms of torture, to make him turn away from his faith. He fled with his tutor Modestus and Modestus&#x27;s wife Crescentia, who was Vitus&#x27;s nanny, to Lucania. He was taken from there to Rome to drive out a demon which had taken possession of a son of the Emperor Diocletian. He successfully performed the exorcism, but, because he stayed faithful to Christianity, he and his tutors were tortured. By a miracle an angel brought back the three to Lucania, where they died from the tortures they had endured. Three days later, Vitus appeared to a distinguished matron named Florentia, who then found the bodies and buried them where they lay.

==Veneration==
The veneration of the martyrs spread rapidly in Southern Italy and Sicily, as is shown by the note in the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot;. Pope Gregory the Great mentions a monastery dedicated to Vitus in Sicily (&quot;Epist.&quot;, I, xlviii, P.L., LXXXVII, 511).

The veneration of Vitus, the chief saint of the group, also appeared very early at Rome. Pope Gelasius I (492–496) mentions a shrine dedicated to him (Jaffé, &quot;Reg. Rom. Pont.&quot;, 2nd ed., I, 6 79), and at Rome in the seventh century the chapel of a deaconry was dedicated to him (&quot;Liber Pont.&quot;, ed. Duchesne, I, 470 sq.).

In AD 756, Abbot Fulrad is said to have brought the relics of St. Vitus to the monastery of St-Denis. They were later presented to Abbot Warin of Corvey in Germany, who solemnly transferred some of them to this abbey in AD 836. From Corvey the veneration of St Vitus spread throughout Westphalia and in the districts of eastern and northern Germany. His popularity grew in Prague, Bohemia when, in AD 925, king Henry I of Germany presented as a gift the bones of one hand of St. Vitus to Wenceslaus, Duke of Bohemia. Since then, this relic has been a sacred treasure in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. Other relics of Saint Vitus were taken in Pavia (they were kept in the church of San Marino) by the emperor Charles IV in 1355 and were brought to Prague.

The veneration of St. Vitus became very popular in Slavic lands, where his name (Sveti Vid) may have replaced more ancient worship of the god of light Svetovid.

In Serbia his feast day, known as Vidovdan, is of particular historical importance. The day is part of the Kosovo Myth — the Battle of Kosovo occurred on that day; several events have symbolically occurred on that day, such as the 1914 assassination of the Austrian royal couple; Vitus was the patron saint of the Kingdom of Serbia. In Hungary he has been venerated as &quot;Szent Vid&quot; since the early Middle Ages. In Bulgaria, it is called Vidovden (Видовден) or Vidov Den (Видов ден) and is particularly well known among the Shopi, in the western part of the country. In Croatia, 123 churches are dedicated to St. Vitus.

In the Netherlands, Vitus is the patron saint of Winschoten, as well as of the region of the Gooi, where in each of the three largest towns (Hilversum, Bussum and Naarden), the main Catholic Church is dedicated to St Vitus.

Vitus is one of the Fourteen Martyrs who give aid in times of trouble. He is specifically invoked against chorea, which is called &quot;St. Vitus Dance&quot;.

He is represented as a young man with a palm-leaf, in a cauldron, sometimes with a raven and a lion, his iconographic attribute because according to the legend he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling tar and molten lead, but miraculously escaped unscathed.

The names of Saints Modestus and Crescentia were added in the 11th century to the Roman Calendar, so that from then on all three names were celebrated together until 1969, when their feast was removed from the General Roman Calendar. Vitus is still recognized as a saint of the Catholic Church, being included in the Roman Martyrology under 15 June, and Mass may be celebrated in his honor on that day wherever the Roman Rite is celebrated, while Modestus and Crescentia, who are associated with Vitus in legend, have been omitted, because they appear to be merely fictitious personages.

Vitus is the patron saint of the city of Rijeka in Croatia; the towns of Ciminna and Vita in Sicily; Forio on the island of Ischia, the town of Sapri in Campania; the &quot;contrada&quot; of San Vito, in Torella dei Lombardi, in Avellino; the town of Rapone, Italy; the Gooi region in the Netherlands; the Italian colony of San Vito in Costa Rica; and the town of St. Vith in Belgium. Various places in Austria and Bavaria are named Sankt Veit in his honour.

The saint&#x27;s feast day is also the subject of a popular weather rhyme: &quot;If St. Vitus&#x27; Day be rainy weather, it shall rain for thirty days together&quot;. This rhyme often appears in such publications as almanacs; its origin is uncertain.

Michael J. Towsend writes that &quot;the phrase &#x27;The patron saint of Methodism is St Vitus&#x27; summed up with reasonable accuracy many people&#x27;s impressions of the Methodist Church. Methodists, surely, are supremely busy people, always rushing around organizing things and setting up committees to do good works. They can generally be relied upon to play their part in running Christian Aid Week, the sponsored walk for the local hospice or the group protesting about homelessness, and they are known, even now, to be activists in trades unions and political parties.&quot;

<text>The Irish Traveller Movement (ITM) is a national organisation for members of the Travelling community and Traveller organisations in Ireland.

== History ==
The Irish Traveller Movement (ITM) was founded in 1990 and incorporated in 1998, with Catherine Joyce as the founding chairperson. The organisation represents 40 local and national Traveller groups from the island of Ireland.

== Core Activities ==
The ITM collects and publishes data and reports relating to living conditions, educational prospects, and other aspects of the lives of Irish Travellers. It advocates for equality for Travellers in all aspects of life, promotes pride in the culture and identity of the Travelling community and promotes and produces evidence based solutions for all issues affecting the Travelling community.

The organisation has partnered with organisations such as St Stephen&#x27;s Green Trust on programmes such as the Travellers in Prison Initiative. It has held initiatives such as Traveller Focus Week from 2004. ITM was one of the groups which submitted recommendations to a Seanad Committee on the inclusion of Travellers in Irish public life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ITM highlighted the difficulty the Travelling communities have relating to access to clean water, toilets, and the cramped sites on which many families live.

===Free legal aid===
ITM is one of a number of not-for-profit organisations in Ireland which provide free legal advice to travellers, alongside Mercy Law Resource Centre, Ballymun Community Law Centre, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Irish Refugee Council, the Free Legal Advice Centres, and Northside Community Law Centre.

===Roma community===
The organisation has also been one of the groups, alongside Pavee Point, who have partnered with organisations and individuals advocating for the Roma community.

=== Traveller Pride Week ===
The ITM is the coordinator of the Traveller Pride Week, which hosts the Traveller Pride Awards. It established the awards in 2009. Awards are given out across 7 fields: community, enterprise and employment, sport, education, intersectionality, youth, arts and culture, and music. Past winners have included Laura Angela Collins and Oein DeBhairduin.

<text>Irish Travellers (, meaning &quot;the walking people&quot;), also known as Mincéirs (Shelta: Mincéirí) or Pavees, are a traditionally peripatetic indigenous ethno-cultural group originating in Ireland.

They are predominantly English-speaking, though many also speak Shelta, a language of mixed English and Irish origin. The majority of Irish Travellers are Roman Catholic, the predominant religion in the Republic of Ireland. They are one of several groups identified as &quot;Travellers&quot; in the UK and Ireland. Irish Travellers have distinctive artistic traditions, some of which have influenced the broader cultural tapestry of Ireland. Irish Traveller music, known for its lively and virtuosic melodies, is a significant and influential part of Ireland’s musical landscape. Irish Travellers have certain clothing traditions which are distinct from those of the wider Irish population. Beady pockets for example are a feature of traditional Irish Traveller­ attire—flat, pocket-sized pouches characterised by intricate embroidery and beadwork.

Despite sometimes being incorrectly referred to as &quot;Gypsies&quot;, Irish Travellers are not genetically related to the Roma people, who are of Indo-Aryan origin. Genetic analysis has shown Irish Travellers to be of Irish extraction, and that they likely diverged from the settled Irish population in the 1600s, probably during the time of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Centuries of cultural isolation have led Travellers to become genetically distinct from the settled Irish. Traveller rights groups have long advocated for ethnic status from the Irish government, succeeding in 2017.

Irish Traveller communities are located in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. As of 2016, there were 32,302 Travellers within Ireland. They represent 0.7% of the total population of the Republic of Ireland. There are different estimates about the size of the total population of people with Traveller ancestry, because many people of Traveller descent do not declare themselves Travellers. The United Kingdom alone is believed to be home to up to 300,000 Roma and Traveller people (including Romanichal). The British Government considers Travellers resident in the UK to form part of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) community.

==Nomenclature==
Travellers refer to themselves in Shelta as &quot;Mincéirí&quot; or in Irish as (&quot;the walking people&quot;).

==Origins==
There are numerous theories and oral histories surrounding the origins of Irish Travellers as a distinct group. Research has been complicated by the fact that the group appears to have no written records of its own, with oral tradition through storytelling being the primary method through which the Traveller community disseminates its own history and culture.

Deeper documentation of Shelta and the Travellers dates to the 1830s, but knowledge of Irish Travellers has been seen from the 1100s, as well as the 1500s–1800s. Many decrees against begging in England were directed at Travellers, passed by King Edward VI around 1551; for example the &quot;Acte for tynckers and pedlers&quot;. The culture of Irish Travellers resembles the culture of other itinerant communities with regard to self-employment, family networks, birth, marriage, and burial rituals, taboos, and folklore. They worked with metal and travelled throughout Ireland working at making items such as ornaments, jewellery, and horse harnesses to earn a living. As a result, they (along with other itinerant groups) were referred to as &quot;tinkers&quot; or &quot;tinklers&quot; (meaning &quot;tin smiths&quot;), terms regarded in later years as derogatory.

===Origin theories===
Many different theories have been put forward to explain the origins of Ireland&#x27;s itinerant population. It has been suggested Travellers are related to Romani due to a similarly itinerant lifestyle, but genetic testing has shown no evidence for a recent ancestral component between Irish Travellers and Romani Travellers. There is also a theory that an indigenous, itinerant community of craftsmen are the ancestors of Travellers, who never settled down. Other speculations on their origin are that they were descended from those Irish who were made homeless during the Cromwellian conquest in the 1650s, or made homeless in either the 1741 or the 1840s famine, or due to eviction.

According to Helleiner (2003), current scholarship is investigating the background of Gaelic Ireland before the English Tudor conquest. The mobile nature and traditions of a Gaelic society based on pastoralism rather than land tenure before this event implies that Travellers represent descendants of the Gaelic social order marginalised during the change-over to an English landholding society. An early example of this mobile element in the population, and how displacement of clans can lead to increased nomadism within aristocratic warrior societies, is the displacement of the Clan Murtough O&#x27;Connors after the Norman invasion.

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic evidence reported in 2000 regarding Irish Travellers supported Irish ancestry; several distinct subpopulations; and the distinctiveness of the midland counties due to Viking influence. In 2011, researchers at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and the University of Edinburgh analysed DNA samples from 40 Travellers. The study provided evidence that Irish Travellers are a genetically separate Irish ethnic minority which has been distinct from the settled Irish community for at least 1,000 years: The report claimed that Travellers are as distinct from the settled community as Icelanders are from Norwegians.

In 2017 a further genetic study using profiles of 50 Irish Travellers, 143 European Roma, 2,232 settled Irish, 2,039 British and 6,255 European or worldwide individuals, confirmed ancestral origins from within the general population of Ireland. An estimated time of divergence between the settled population and Travellers was set at a minimum of 8 generations ago, with generations at 30 years, hence 240 years and a maximum of 14 generations or 420 years ago. The best fit was estimated at 360 years ago, giving an approximate date in the 1650s.

Irish Travellers are not an entirely homogeneous group, instead reflecting some of the variation also seen in the settled population. Four distinct genetic clusters were identified in the 2017 study, and these match social groupings within the community.

Irish Travellers, particularly those that experienced a life of nomadism prior to the 2002 Irish legislation that altered living conditions, exhibit distinct gut microbiota compared to other Irish citizens, which is comparable to gut microbiomes observed in non-industrialized societies.

====Genetic disease studies====
Genetic studies by Miriam Murphy, David Croke, and other researchers identified certain genetic diseases such as galactosemia that are more common in the Irish Traveller population, involving identifiable allelic mutations that are rarer among the rest of the community.

Two main hypotheses have arisen, speculating whether:
* the prevalence resulted from marriages made largely within and among the Traveller community,
or
* suggesting shared descent from an original Irish carrier long ago with ancestors unrelated to the rest of the Irish population.
In their conclusion Murphy, McHugh, &quot;et al&quot; write that:
:The fact that Q188R is the sole mutant allele among the Travellers as compared to the non-Traveller group may be the result of a founder effect in the isolation of a small group of the Irish population from their peers as founders of the Traveller sub-population. This would favour the second, endogenous, hypothesis of Traveller origins.&quot;

More specifically, they found that Q188R was found in 100% of Traveller samples, and in 89% of other Irish samples, indicating that the Traveller group was typical of the larger Irish population.

==Language==
Irish Travellers speak English and sometimes one of two dialects of Shelta — Gammon (or Gamin) and Irish Traveller Cant. Shelta has been dated back to the 18th century but may be older. Cant, which derives from Irish, is a combination of English and Shelta.

 writes that the Irish Traveller Gammon vocabulary is derived from pre-13th-century Gaelic idioms with ten per cent Indian origin Romani language vocabulary. Since Shelta is a mixture of English and Irish grammar, the etymology is not straightforward. The language is made up mostly of Irish lexicon, being classified as a grammar-lexicon language with the grammar being English-based. Gaelic language expert Kuno Meyer and Romani language linguist John Sampson both asserted that Shelta existed as far back as the 13th century, 300 years before the first Romani populations arrived in Ireland or Britain.

Shelta is a cryptolect (secret language). Irish Travellers do not like to share the language with outsiders, named &quot;Buffers&quot;, or non-Travellers. When speaking Shelta in front of Buffers, Travellers will disguise the structure so as to make it seem like they are not speaking Shelta at all. There is fear that if outsiders know the entirety of the language, it will be used to bring further discrimination to the Traveller community.

==The Irish state and Irish Travellers==

There was no specific state focus on Travellers prior to the creation of an independent Irish state in 1922. Issues with traditional travelling groups came under loosely defined vagrancy laws, from when Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. In 1959 the 1959–1963 government of Ireland established a &quot;Commission on Itinerancy&quot; in response to calls to deal with the &quot;itinerant problem&quot;. This was made up of senior representatives of the Irish state, judges, Gardaí (Irish police), religious organisations and numerous farming lobby groups such as Macra na Feirme. The commission had no Traveller representatives, and while attempts were made to consult Travellers, these were &quot;bizarre&quot; unannounced visits which resulted in little input into the report.

The commission had the following terms of reference:

The commission&#x27;s 1963 report defined &quot;itinerant&quot; as &quot;a person who had no fixed place of abode and habitually wandered from place to place, but excluding travelling show-people and travelling entertainers&quot;. It recommended assimilation of Travellers by settling them in fixed dwellings with the ultimate aim being that of essentially ending Traveller identity, viewing the Netherlands&#x27; approach to its travelling minority as a model. This assimilation was to be achieved by the effective criminalisation of nomadism, and the report paved the way for an increasing state emphasis on criminal laws and penalties for trespass.

At the time, about 60% of Irish Travellers lived in barrel-roofed horse-drawn wagons, with almost 40% still using tents in summer (fewer in winter).

The Travelling People Review Body (1981–1983) advocated integration rather than assimilation, with provision for serviced halting sites. The Body&#x27;s membership included Travellers.
The Task Force on the Travelling Community (1993–1995) moved to an intercultural paradigm.

On 30 May 2019 the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) established a joint committee &quot;on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community&quot;.

In May 2021, the Ombudsman for Children, Niall Muldoon, published a report that was highly critical of the standards of accommodation provided for Travellers, describing some accommodation issues as &quot;deplorable&quot;.

==Population==

Irish Travellers have a higher fertility rate than the general Irish population; the Central Statistics Office of Ireland recorded in 2016 that 44.5% of Traveller women aged 40–49 had five or more children, compared to 4.2% of women overall in this age group. This gap has dramatically reduced over time; in 1987 the Irish Traveller birth rate was at 5.3 children per woman compared to the general Irish population&#x27;s 2.3, while in 2008 the Irish Traveller birth rate was at 2.9 children per woman compared to the general Irish population&#x27;s 2.1.

=== Ireland ===
The 2016 census in the Republic of Ireland reported the number of Irish Travellers as 30,987, up from 29,495 in 2011. In 2006 the number was 22,369. A further 1,700 to 2,000 were estimated to live in Northern Ireland.

From the 2006 Irish census, it was determined that 20,975 dwell in urban areas and 1,460 were living in rural areas. With an overall population of just 0.5% some areas were found to have a higher proportion, with high Traveller concentrations in Clare, Dublin, Galway and Limerick. There were found to be 9,301 Travellers in the 0–14 age range, comprising 41.5% of the Traveller population, and a further 3,406 of them were in the 15–24 age range, comprising 15.2%. Children of the age range 0–17 comprised 48.7% of the Traveller population.

Following the findings of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study (estimates for 2008), the figure for Northern Ireland was revised to 3,905 and that for the Republic to 36,224.

The rural community of Rathkeale, County Limerick, has one of the largest populations of any towns percentage-wise, with around half of its residents having Irish Traveller ancestry. Traveller clans, gangs, and associations or events linked to the Traveller community and culture may often have the name Rathkeale linked with it, such as the Rathkeale Rovers. It is sometimes considered a rural mecca of Travellers in this regard. There are other communities, including in Dublin as well. Tuam (c. 5% Traveller) and Longford both have abundant Traveller communities in rural areas as well. While not as high proportion-wise, due to its high population in general, Dublin and its suburbs have over 5,000 Travellers, whom make up a scant 0.4% of Dublin&#x27;s population proper and 0.2-0.3% of the Greater Dublin population. Ballyfermot, Dublin has a large Traveller community, mostly located in the Labre Park area.

County Longford has the highest Traveller percentage rate for the 0-24 age group, of any Irish county, at 5%, followed by County Galway at 3%.

=== Diaspora ===
==== United Kingdom ====
In 2011, for the first time, the census category &quot;Irish Traveller&quot; was introduced as part of the broader Gypsy/Traveller section. While Irish Travellers and Romani Gypsy people are genetically distant from each other, with Travellers having Irish roots, and Roma Gypsies having alleged South Asian heritage, they are conflated in the UK Census, so the number of Travellers may be lower than what is reported in this category.

The self reported figure for collective Gypsy/Traveller populations were 63,193 but estimates of Irish Travellers living in Great Britain range are about 15,000 as part of a total estimation of over 300,000 Romani and other Traveller groups in the UK. In the 2021 Census of England and Wales, the Gypsy/Irish Traveller community numbered 67,757, or 0.1% of the population.

The London Boroughs of Harrow and Brent contain significant Irish Traveller populations. In addition to those on various official sites, there are a number who are settled in local authority housing. These are mostly women who wish their children to have a chance at formal education. They and the children may or may not travel in the summer but remain in close contact with the wider Irish Traveller community.

There are also a number of Irish Traveller communities in the Home counties.

==== United States ====
An estimated 10,000 people in the United States are descendants of Travellers who left Ireland, mostly between 1845 and 1860 during the Great Famine. However, there are no official population figures regarding Irish Travellers in the United States as the US census does not recognise them as an ethnic group. While some sources estimate their population in the U.S. to be 10,000, others suggest their population is 40,000. According to research published in 1992, Irish Travellers in the U.S. divide themselves up into groups that are based on historical residence: Ohio Travellers, Georgia Travellers, Texas Travellers, and Mississippi Travellers. The Georgia Travellers&#x27; camp is made up of about eight hundred families, the Mississippi Travellers, about three hundred families, and the Texas Travellers, under fifty families.&quot;

The largest and most affluent population of about 2,500 lives in Murphy Village, outside of the town of North Augusta, South Carolina. Other communities exist in Memphis, Tennessee; Hernando, Mississippi; and near White Settlement, Texas; where the families stay in their homes during the winter, and leave during the summer, while smaller enclaves can be found across Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.

Irish Travellers in the U.S. are said to speak English and Shelta, a form of Cant. The Cant spoken in the U.S. is similar to the Cant spoken in Ireland, but differs in some respects in that the language has transformed into a type of pidgin English over the generations. They typically do construction work, such as asphalting, spray-painting, and laying linoleum, or as itinerant workers.

==Religion==
Travellers have a distinctive approach to religion; the vast majority of them are practising Roman Catholics, and they also pay particular attention to issues of healing. Many have been known to follow a strict code of behaviour that dictates some of their moral beliefs and influences their actions. Irish Travellers are known to practice their Catholic faith at holy wells and shrines across Ireland. Travellers were excluded in the past from everyday parish activities in Ireland. Richard O&#x27;Brien of the Kerry diocese is a member of the Traveller community who started a groundbreaking initiative to reach out to the Irish Traveller community and help them to be more involved in parish life. The Irish Bishops Conference released a statement to every parish, asking them to welcome Irish Travellers to their towns and villages throughout Ireland.

== Education ==
In 2004, it was reported that Traveller children often grow up outside educational systems. Traveller children were reported in 2017 to leave education at a younger age than children in the settled community, with 28% leaving the education system by age 13.
One of the causes identified is the historical marginalisation of the community within the educational system. The segregation of Traveller children from their settled peers led to worse outcomes in regard to undertaking state examinations, and levels of numeracy and literacy. The Irish Traveller Movement, a community advocacy group, promotes equal access to education for Traveller children. In the Census of Ireland 2016, 167 Travellers are enumerated as having a third level educational qualification, a rise from 89 in 2011.

In December 2010, the Irish Equality Tribunal ruled in favour of a Traveller child in an anti-discrimination suit which covered the admission practices of CBS High School Clonmel in County Tipperary. In July 2011, the secondary school in Clonmel successfully appealed the decision of the Equality Tribunal that its admission criteria were indirectly discriminatory against children from the Traveller community.

== Notable people ==

===Sports===
Irish Travellers have a long history of bare-knuckle boxing. Toughness and the ability to fight are viewed as particularly important among Traveller men, and their involvement in boxing has extended to traditional amateur and professional boxing. Irish Traveller Francie Barrett represented Ireland at the 1996 Olympics, while Andy Lee fought for Ireland at the 2004 Olympics and later became the first Traveller to win a professional boxing world championship when he won the WBO middleweight title in 2014. Tyson Fury is of Irish Traveller heritage and defeated long-reigning Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to become the unified heavyweight world champion.

In the Traveller community, bare-knuckle boxing is seen as a way to resolve disputes and uphold family honour, as shown in the 2011 documentary &quot;Knuckle&quot;. This can lead to injuries, notably &quot;fight bite&quot; where, when punching an opponent, a tooth may cut the hand and bacteria in the opponent&#x27;s mouth may infect the wound. Such infections can lead to permanent disability if left untreated.

Apart from boxing, Irish Travellers, including women, are involved in sports such as football (soccer) and Gaelic handball.

==Health==

The health of Irish Travellers is significantly poorer than that of the general population in Ireland. This is evidenced in a 2007 report published in Ireland, which states that over half of Travellers do not live past the age of 39 years. (By comparison, median life expectancy in Ireland is 81.5 years.) Another government report of 1987 found:

From birth to old age, they have high mortality rates, particularly from accidents, metabolic and congenital problems, but also from other major causes of death. Female Travellers have especially high mortality compared to settled women.

In 2007, the Department of Health and Children in the Republic of Ireland, in conjunction with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, commissioned the University College Dublin&#x27;s School of Public Health and Population Science to conduct a major cross-border study of Travellers&#x27; welfare. The study, including a detailed census of Traveller population and an examination of their health status, was expected to take up to three years to complete. The main results of the study were published in 2010.

The birth rate of Irish Travellers has decreased since the 1990s, but they still have one of the highest birth rates in Europe. The birth rate for the Traveller community for the year 2005 was 33.32 per 1,000, possibly the highest birth rate recorded for any community in Europe.

On average there are ten times more driving fatalities within the Traveller community. At 22%, this represents the most common cause of death among Traveller males. Some 10% of Traveller children die before their second birthday, compared to just 1% of the general population. In Ireland, 2.6% of all deaths in the total population were for people aged under 25, versus 32% for Travellers. In addition, 80% of Travellers die before the age of 65.

According to the National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project, Traveller men are over six times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.

==Marriage==
Marriage among Travellers in their late teens is common. As of the Census of Ireland 2016 58.1% of Irish Travellers were under the age of 25, with 31.9% of this age group married. As of 2016, 201 enumerated Irish Travellers aged 15 to 19 identified themselves as married, down from 250 in 2011. Irish Travellers generally marry other Irish Travellers. Consanguineous marriage is common among Irish Travellers. According to Judith Okely&#x27;s work on Travellers in Britain in the 1970s, &quot;there is no large time span between puberty and marriage&quot;, and the typical marriage age was 16–17 for females and 18–19 for males.

Irish Travellers lived as cohabiters who &quot;married at one time without religious or civil ceremony.&quot; Into the early 20th century about one-third of Irish Travellers were &quot;married according to the law.&quot;

According to Christopher Griffin, sociology and anthropology lecturer at Edith Cowan University, arranged Irish Traveller marriages in the early 21st century &quot;safeguard the girl&#x27;s by securing a man who won&#x27;t mistreat her.&quot; According to Julie Bindel, in &quot;Standpoint&quot;, some Irish Traveller females in the UK are forced into marriages, but Bindel points out that data is difficult to obtain because &quot;the line between an arranged marriage and a forced one is not always clear.&quot;

==Social conflict==
===Discrimination and prejudice===
Travellers are often reported as the subject of explicit political and cultural discrimination, with politicians being elected on promises to block Traveller housing in local communities and individuals frequently refusing service in pubs, shops and hotels.

A 2011 survey by the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland concluded that there is widespread ostracism of Travellers in Ireland, and the report concluded that it could hurt the long-term prospects for Travellers, who &quot;need the intercultural solidarity of their neighbours in the settled community. ... They are too small a minority, i.e., 0.5 per cent, to survive in a meaningful manner without ongoing and supportive personal contact with their fellow citizens in the settled community.&quot; The general prejudice against Travellers hinders efforts by the central government to integrate Travellers into Irish society. Because Travellers are a minority group within Ireland and the United Kingdom, they have always faced discrimination on the basis of their ethnicity as Travellers. They experience discrimination in not having equal access to education, being denied service in pubs, shops, and hotels, and being subject to derogatory language.

In 2016, the USA&#x27;s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for the United Kingdom stated that Irish Travellers reported receiving discrimination on &quot;racial or ethnic grounds&quot; in the country, and stated that the High Court had ruled that the government had illegally discriminated against Travellers by unlawfully subjecting planning applications to special scrutiny.

===Work and income===
According to the 2016 Irish census, 4,524 of 9,055 Travellers over the age of 15 (50%) were &quot;Unemployed having lost or given up previous job&quot;. While 10,653 Travellers were in the labour force, the vast majority, 8,541 (80.2%), were unemployed. Almost 1 in 8 Travellers (11.3%) stated that they were unable to work due to a disability, which was almost three times the rate of the general population (4.3%).

Many Travellers are breeders of dogs such as lurchers and have a long-standing interest in horse trading. The main fairs associated with them are held annually at Ballinasloe (County Galway), Puck Fair (County Kerry), Ballabuidhe Horse Fair (County Cork), the twice-yearly Smithfield Horse Fair (Dublin inner city) and Appleby (England). They are often involved in dealing scrap metals, e.g., 60% of the raw material for Irish steel is sourced from scrap metal, approximately 50% (75,000 metric tonnes) segregated by the community at a value of more than £1.5 million. Such percentages for more valuable non-ferrous metals may be significantly greater.

Since the majority of Irish Travellers&#x27; employment is either self-employment or wage labour, income and financial status varies greatly from family to family. Many families choose not to reveal the specifics of their finances, but when explained it is very difficult to detect any sort of pattern or regular trend of monthly or weekly income. To detect their financial status many look to the state of their possessions: their trailer, motor vehicle, domestic utensils, and any other valuables.

===Social identity===

Irish Travellers are recognised in British and Irish law as an ethnic group. An ethnic group is defined as one whose members identify with each other, usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry. Ethnic identity is also marked by the recognition from others of a group&#x27;s distinctiveness and by common cultural, linguistic, religious, behavioural or biological traits.

The European Parliament Committee of Enquiry on Racism and Xenophobia found them to be among the most discriminated-against ethnic groups in Ireland and yet their status remains insecure in the absence of widespread legal endorsement. Travellers are often viewed by settled people in a negative light, perceived as insular, anti-social, &#x27;drop-outs&#x27; and &#x27;misfits&#x27;, or believed to be involved in criminal and mendicant behaviour, or settling illegally on land owned by others.

===Violence and crime===
In 1960 a government body was set up to conduct research into the Travelling Community in the Republic of Ireland. The Commission on Itinerancy operated under the auspices of the Department of Justice, the persons were appointed by the Junior Minister Charles Haughey. One finding was: that &quot;public brawling fuelled by excessive drinking further added to settled people&#x27;s fear of Travellers&quot;. Furthermore &quot;feuding was felt to be the result of a dearth of pastimes and [of] illiteracy, historically comparable to features of rural Irish life before the Famine&quot;.

A 2011 report, conducted by the Irish Chaplaincy in Britain, &quot;Voices Unheard: A Study of Irish Travellers in Prison&quot; (Mac Gabhann, 2011) found that social, economic and educational exclusion were contributing factors to the &quot;increasingly high levels of imprisonment&quot; of Irish Travellers.

===Travellers&#x27; sites in the United Kingdom===

The passing of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 safeguarded Travellers&#x27; right to a site, but the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 repealed part II of the 1968 act, removing the duty on local authorities in the UK to provide sites for Travellers and giving them the power to close down existing sites. In Northern Ireland, opposition to Travellers&#x27; sites has been led by the Democratic Unionist Party.

However, Travellers make frequent use of other, non-authorised sites. These include public common land and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned lands. A famous example was the occupation of Dale Farm in Essex in 2010. The Travellers claim that there is an under-provision of authorised sites. The Gypsy Council estimates under-provision amounts to insufficient sites for 3,500 people.

==List of Travellers&#x27; organisations==
The following are some of the Travellers&#x27; representative organisations formed since the 1960s:
* Cork Traveller Visibility Group Ltd. (founded early 1990s)
* Exchange House Ireland (1980)
* Friends, Families and Travellers
* Irish Traveller Community (1960s)
* Irish Traveller Movement (founded in 1990)

* The Traveller Movement
* Travellers&#x27; Rights Committee (1981–83)
* Travellers&#x27; Education and Development Group (founded in 1984)
* Pavee Point (founded 1985)

==Depictions and documentaries==

Irish Travellers have been depicted, usually negatively but sometimes with some care and sympathy, in film, radio, print, and television. Shows like &quot;The Riches&quot; (2007–2008), the American television series featuring Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver, take a deeper look into the Traveller lifestyle. The documentary series &quot;Big Fat Gypsy Weddings&quot; (2010, 2011, and 2012) has been commercially successful in the United Kingdom, offering glimpses of Traveller life as viewed at real-life weddings. A 1997 American film, &quot;Traveller&quot;, starring Bill Paxton and Mark Wahlberg, also explored the Travellers in America. In his 1993 documentary &quot;Rules of the Road&quot; German filmmaker Oliver Herbrich portrayed the Travellers in Ireland and the UK as a nomadic ethnic group forced to adapt to a settled lifestyle. Some of the main characters in the Irish sitcom &quot;Derry Girls&quot; encounter a group of Travellers in an episode that aired on 19 March 2019. Brad Pitt played a bare-knuckle Traveller boxer in the movie &quot;Snatch&quot;. The 2005 Irish horror film &quot;Isolation&quot; has Traveller characters in its plot.

<text>Gloucester County ( ) is a county in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 38,711. Its county seat is Gloucester Courthouse. The county was founded in 1651 in the Virginia Colony and is named for Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester (third son of King Charles I of England).

Gloucester County is included in the Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC Metropolitan Statistical Area. Located at the east end of the lower part of the Middle Peninsula, it is bordered on the south by the York River and the lower Chesapeake Bay on the east. The waterways shaped its development. Gloucester County is about east of Virginia&#x27;s capital, Richmond.

Werowocomoco, capital of the large and powerful Powhatan Confederacy (a union of 30 indigenous tribes under a paramount chief), was located on this part of the peninsula. In 2003 archeologists established that dense village had been located at this site from AD 1200 to the early 17th century.

The county was developed by colonists primarily for tobacco plantations, based on the labor of enslaved Africans imported in the slave trade. Tobacco was one of the first commodity crops but fishing also developed as an important industry. The county was home to numerous planters who were among the First Families of Virginia and leaders before the American Revolutionary War. Thomas Jefferson wrote early works for Virginia and colonial independence while staying at Rosewell Plantation, home of John Page (his close friend and fellow student at the College of William and Mary).

Gloucester County is rich in farmland. Its fishing industry is important to the state as well. It has a retail center located around the main street area of the county seat. Gloucester County and adjacent York County are linked by the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge, a toll facility across the York River carrying U.S. Route 17 to the Virginia Peninsula area. Gloucester County is self-nicknamed the &quot;Daffodil Capital of the World&quot;; it hosts an annual daffodil festival, parade and flower show.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric ===
This area was inhabited for thousands of years by successive cultures of hunter-gatherer Indian peoples; artifacts have been dated to at least the late Woodland Period (c. AD 1000).

An important village site known as Werowocomoco was occupied by c. AD 1200 by the Algonquian-speaking peoples of the numerous emerging tribes in the area. Before the late 16th century, the Powhatan Confederacy had been formed. It was made up of an estimated 30 tribes in the coastal region, who spoke distinct but related languages, and was led by a paramount chief, known as the Powhatan. The Powhatan Confederacy was estimated to total 12,000 to 15,000 people across the coastal region of present-day Virginia. Werowocomoco was the stronghold and capital of this confederacy, located on the north side of the York River in what is now Gloucester.

This complex, stratified society had developed in part due to the cultivation and processing by women of varieties of maize, beans and squash. With these crops, the women produced a surplus that, together with the game and fish collected by the men, supported a dense population in a number of settlements. The people also gathered nuts, berries and other foods of the region.

=== European colonists ===
Around 1570, Spanish Jesuits attempted to establish what was known as the Ajacan Mission on the south shore of the York River across from Gloucester. They were killed by natives led by a Christian convert named Don Luis, who was affiliated with a village known as Chiskiack (Naval Weapons Station Yorktown much later was developed at this site in present-day York County; the historic village site has been preserved.)

When English settlers founded Jamestown in 1607 on the James River to the north, they soon came into conflict with local Indians. The newcomers competed for land, game and other resources in the Powhatan territory, and the two cultures did not understand each other&#x27;s concepts of property, particularly in land use.

In late 1607, John Smith was captured and taken to Chief Powhatan at Werowocomoco, his eastern capital. According to legend, Powhatan&#x27;s daughter Pocahontas saved John Smith from being executed by the natives; however, some historians question the accuracy of much of Smith&#x27;s account of that incident. Smith was accompanied by other Englishmen when he returned in a later visit to the Powhatan at Werowocomoco.

=== Lost site of Werowocomoco ===
After the Powhatan moved their capital to a safer, inland location and abandoned the village around 1609, knowledge of this site was lost. Researchers later tried to identify it by Smith&#x27;s historic writings. The current site of West Point seemed to offer a clue to its location; from there, Smith had noted the distance downstream to Werowocomoco. Based upon his description, at one time scholars thought the former capital was located near Wicomico (site of Powhatan&#x27;s Chimney), about southeast of present-day West Point. Smith also noted that Jamestown was from Werowocomoco &quot;as the crow flies.&quot; Using that measure, the site near Wicomico is about 12 miles from Jamestown.

In 1977, archeologist Daniel Mouer of Virginia Commonwealth University identified a site on Purtan Bay as the possible location of Werowocomoco; it was also about 12 miles from Jamestown. He was able to collect artifacts from the surface of plowed fields and along the beach, but the landowner did not want any excavation. Mouer found fragments of Indian ceramics dating to the Late Woodland Period and determined that the area was the possible site of Werowocomoco.

More than 20 years later, a different landowner authorized archaeological excavation on the property. Between March 2002 and April 2003, the Werowocomoco Research Group conducted excavations and analysis at the Werowocomoco site. The research group is a collaborative effort of the College of William and Mary, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and Virginia tribes descended from the Powhatan Confederacy. Initial testing included digging 603 test holes deep and apart. They found thousands of artifacts, including a blue bead which may have been made in Europe for trading. Combined with the historical descriptions by English colonists of Werowocomoco, researchers believe these discoveries have established the site of the ancient capital. &quot;We believe we have sufficient evidence to confirm that the property is indeed the village of Werowocomoco,&quot; said Randolph Turner, director of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources&#x27; Portsmouth Regional Office in 2003.

Two Gloucester-based archaeologists, Thane Harpole and David Brown, have worked at the site since 2002 and continue to participate in the excavations. Archeologists have discovered a dispersed village community occupying the site from AD 1200 through the early 17th century. They recovered artifacts (including native pottery and stone tools), as well as floral and faunal food remains from the large residential community. The research group has also recovered English trade goods produced from glass, copper, and other metals originating in Jamestown. The colonists&#x27; accounts of interaction at Werowocomoco during the early days of Jamestown emphasized Powhatan&#x27;s interests in acquiring English objects (particularly copper, which the Indians used to create their own &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;.

The project is noted for the researchers&#x27; consultation and collaboration with members of the local Indian tribes – the Mattaponi and Pamunkey, descendants of the Powhatan Confederacy. Such archeological sites often contain burials and associated sacred artifacts important to these tribes:

Gloucester County has celebrated Werowocomoco and other Powhatan-heritage sites as part of the county&#x27;s history. Both the newly identified site on Purtan Bay and Powhatan&#x27;s Chimney at Wicomico are within the territory which Indians have considered as part of Werowocomoco. In the Algonquian language, the &quot;village&quot; of the chief was not defined as a small place, but the term referred to &quot;the lands&quot; where he lived. The custom of the Powhatan tribes was to relocate their villages within a general area to allow lands to recover from cultivation or move to better sources of water and game.

=== English developments ===
In 1619, the Virginia Company divided its developed areas into four incorporations, called &quot;citties&quot; . At that time, most of the area which became Gloucester County would have been considered part of &quot;James Cittie&quot; (although it was not yet settled). In 1634, by order of King Charles I the colony was divided into the eight shires of Virginia. First named Charles River Shire by the English, York County was renamed in 1642 during the English Civil War. The Pamunkey called the river of their territory &quot;Pamunkey&quot;; residents retained that name for the portion upstream from West Point. The English first named the major river the Charles River; during the English Civil War, it was renamed as the York River).

The colonial government granted early land patents in the area in 1639, but it was not until after 1644 that Gloucester was considered safe for settlement. By that time, Algonquian peoples had been pushed out of the area by colonists after many died in epidemics of infectious diseases. They had no immunity to the new diseases carried by the Europeans. George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather received a Gloucester County land patent in 1650.

=== Gloucester County formation and divisions ===
Gloucester County was formed from York County in 1651. No legislative enactment has been found for its formation. Gloucester County consisted of four parishes: Abingdon, Kingston, Petsworth and Ware. It was named for Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester, third son of Charles I. Gloucester County figured prominently in the history of the colony and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kingston parish was renamed as Mathews County in 1791, after the American Revolutionary War and independence of the United States. The remaining three parishes were retained in Gloucester; the county was split on what is now the eastern county line.

=== Plantations and historic sites ===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, Gloucester was developed as a major tobacco-producing area; this was the chief commodity crop and the basis of the wealth of major planters. Many of the old plantation houses and private estates have been preserved in good condition. These establishments are periodically open to public visitation during Historic Garden Week. Examples of colonial architecture are the Episcopal churches of Ware (1690) and Abingdon (1755), where Presidents Washington and Jefferson worshiped. Some early colonial buildings at the county seat on Courthouse Green continue to be used for public purposes.
During the 17th century, the tip of land protruding into the York River was named Tyndall&#x27;s Point by Robert Tyndall, mapmaker for Captain John Smith. In 1667, colonists built fortifications there, at what was then called Gloucester Point. These defenses were rebuilt and strengthened many times from the colonial period through the American Civil War. This site is also known for the &quot;Second Surrender&quot; by General Lord Charles Cornwallis to General George Washington at Yorktown.

===Guinea===
One area of Gloucester County is known as Guinea; it includes the unincorporated communities of Achilles, Maryus, Perrin, Severn, and Big Island. Located near Gloucester Point, the area has been the center of the county&#x27;s seafood industry. (The Atwell,Shackelford, Rowe, West, Jenkins, Green, Kellum, King and Belvin families are chief among those who have worked in the fishing industry here). Although the industry has declined, it remains a cultural core of the community. The fishermen are known locally as &quot;Guineamen&quot;. They speak a distinct form of non-rhotic, Southern English.

The name &quot;Guinea&quot; is of uncertain origin. Residents in this area have been referred to as &quot;Guineamen&quot; at least since 1730. As noted by George Dow in 1969, London physician George Pinckard referred to the master of a ship containing slaves from the Guinea coast as a &quot;Guinea Man&quot; in letters dating 1795. It is likely this area was called Guinea after being used as a landing site for importation of slaves from that area. Another story, passed among the &quot;Guineamen&quot; is that people on the Guinea Neck were continuing to use golden Guineas to pay for things up from about 1781–1860, the start of the American Civil War.

At one time, the name was thought to have derived from the period of the American Revolutionary War. Loyalists quartered Hessian mercenaries here who were attached to Cornwallis&#x27; army; they were paid one guinea per day. The Hessians were thought to have occupied lower Gloucester during the closing days of the Revolutionary War, or to have settled here after deserting the British. Cornwallis sent British troops and cavalry to occupy Gloucester in October 1781; Hessians may have been a part of that contingent due to Gloucester&#x27;s strategic importance at the mouth of the York River.

===Daffodils===

The history of the daffodil in Gloucester County is nearly as old as the county. When Gloucester was formed in 1651 from part of York County, early settlers brought daffodils from England. Settlers soon discovered the soil and weather conditions were good for them. The bulbs were passed from neighbor to neighbor, naturalizing by the beginning of the 20th century. The daffodil industry (which earned the county the title &quot;Daffodil Capital of America&quot;) developed during the 1930s and 1940s. Today, the county&#x27;s daffodils are celebrated every year with the annual &quot;Daffodil Festival&quot;. The whole county comes out during the first weekend in April to celebrate the county&#x27;s history. \.

===Modern day===
Gloucester is a growing and increasingly changing county that is an integral part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. Growth in the Peninsula area has encouraged development in the Gloucester Point and the Courthouse regions of Gloucester. Gloucester&#x27;s Main Street and U.S. Route 17 have served as vital corridors of commercial and community growth in the county. Between 1970 and 2000, the county&#x27;s population grew by over 60% and this additional influx of new residents encouraged mass commercial and residential development, and subsequently has become an important commercial center for the Middle Peninsula, upper Hampton Roads, and the Northern Neck areas.

Canon Virginia has a recycling facility in the White Marsh area of the county, which processes old printer cartridges and recycle their parts for new cartridges. Peace Frogs, based near Gloucester Courthouse is an apparel brand that makes a full line of apparel and accessories sporting frog designs.

The Virginia Institute of Marine Science is based in Gloucester Point. VIMS is the College of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s Marine Science post-graduate school.

Despite an influx in development, Gloucester still maintains a large amount of rural and farmland (especially in the northern end of the county) which contributes to the county&#x27;s rich agricultural tradition.

Gloucester County&#x27;s Comprehensive Plan cites both Gloucester Point and Gloucester Courthouse as development districts.

<doc id="89908" wikidata="Q128393" url="?curid=89908" title="Nomad">
<text>Nomads are communities without fixed habitation who regularly move to and from areas. Such groups include hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads (owning livestock), tinkers and trader nomads. In the twentieth century, the population of nomadic pastoral tribes slowly decreased, reaching an estimated 30–40 million nomads in the world .

Nomadic hunting and gathering—following seasonally available wild plants and game—is by far the oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds of domesticated livestock, driving or accompanying them in patterns that normally avoid depleting pastures beyond their ability to recover. Nomadism is also a lifestyle adapted to infertile regions such as steppe, tundra, or ice and sand, where mobility is the most efficient strategy for exploiting scarce resources. For example, many groups living in the tundra are reindeer herders and are semi-nomadic, following forage for their animals.

Sometimes also described as &quot;nomadic&quot; are various itinerant populations who move among densely populated areas to offer specialized services (crafts or trades) to their residents—external consultants, for example. These groups are known as &quot;peripatetic nomads&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;nomad&quot; comes from the Middle French , from Latin (&quot;wandering shepherd&quot;), from Ancient Greek (, “roaming, wandering, esp. to find pasture”), which is derived from the Ancient Greek (, “pasture”).

==Common characteristics==

Nomads are communities who move from place to place as a way of obtaining food, finding pasture for livestock, or otherwise making a living. Most nomadic groups follow a fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic people traditionally travel by animal, canoe or on foot. Animals include camels, horses and alpaca. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Some nomads may live in homes or homeless shelters, though this would necessarily be on a temporary or itinerant basis.

Nomads keep moving for different reasons. Nomadic foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, Negritos of Southeast Asia, and San of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads, on the other hand, make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep, or yaks; these nomads usually travel in search of pastures for their flocks. The Fulani and their cattle travel through the grasslands of Niger in western Africa. Some nomadic peoples, especially herders, may also move to raid settled communities or to avoid enemies. Nomadic craftworkers and merchants travel to find and serve customers. They include the Gadia Lohar blacksmiths of India, the Roma traders, Scottish travellers and Irish travellers.

Many nomadic and pastorally nomadic peoples are associated with semi-arid and desert climates; examples include the Mongolic and Turkic peoples of Central Asia, the Plains Indians of the Great Plains, and the Amazigh and other peoples of the Sahara Desert. Pastoral nomads who are residents of arid climates include the Fulani of the Sahel, the Khoikhoi of South Africa and Namibia, groups of Northeast Africa such as Somalis and Oromo, and the Bedouin of the Middle East.

Most nomads travel in groups of families, bands, or tribes. These groups are based on kinship and marriage ties or on formal agreements of cooperation. A council of adult males makes most of the decisions, though some tribes have chiefs.

In the case of Mongolian nomads, a family moves twice a year. These two movements generally occur during the summer and winter. The winter destination is usually located near the mountains in a valley and most families already have fixed winter locations. Their winter locations have shelter for animals and are not used by other families while they are out. In the summer they move to a more open area in which the animals can graze. Most nomads usually move within the same region and do not travel very far. Since they usually circle around a large area, communities form and families generally know where the other ones are. Often, families do not have the resources to move from one province to another unless they are moving out of the area permanently. A family can move on its own or with others; if it moves alone, they are usually no more than a couple of kilometres from each other. The geographical closeness of families is usually for mutual support. Pastoral nomad societies usually do not have large populations.

One nomadic society, the Mongols, gave rise to the largest land empire in history. The Mongols originally consisted of loosely organized nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia. In the late 12th century, Genghis Khan united them and other nomadic tribes to found the Mongol Empire, which eventually stretched the length of Asia.

The nomadic way of life has become increasingly rare. Many countries have converted pastures into cropland and forced nomadic peoples into permanent settlements.

Modern forms of nomadic peoples are variously referred to as &quot;shiftless&quot;, &quot;gypsies&quot;, &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot;, hunter-gatherers, refugees and urban homeless or street-people, depending on their individual circumstances. These terms may be used in a derogatory sense.

According to Gérard Chaliand, terrorism originated in nomad-warrior cultures. He points to Machiavelli&#x27;s classification of war into two types, which Chaliand interprets as describing a difference between warfare in sedentary and nomadic societies:

There are two different kinds of war. The one springs from the ambition of princes or republics that seek to extend their empire; such were the wars of Alexander the Great, and those of the Romans, and those which two hostile powers carry on against each other. These wars are dangerous but never go so far as to drive all its inhabitants out of a province, because the conqueror is satisfied with the submission of the people... The other kind of war is when an entire people, constrained by famine or war, leave their country with their families for the purpose of seeking a new home in a new country, not for the purpose of subjecting it to their dominion as in the first case, but with the intention of taking absolute possession of it themselves and driving out or killing its original inhabitants.

Primary historical sources for nomadic steppe-style warfare are found in many languages: Chinese, Persian, Polish, Russian, Classical Greek, Armenian, Latin and Arabic. These sources concern both the true steppe nomads (Mongols, Huns, Magyars and Scythians) and also the semi-settled people like Turks, Crimean Tatars and Russians, who retained or, in some cases, adopted the nomadic form of warfare.

==Hunter-gatherers==
Hunter-gatherers (also known as foragers) move from campsite to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables. Hunting and gathering describes early peoples&#x27; subsistence living style. Following the development of agriculture, most hunter-gatherers were eventually either displaced or converted to farming or pastoralist groups. Only a few contemporary societies, such as the Pygmies, the Hadza people, and some uncontacted tribes in the Amazon rainforest, are classified as hunter-gatherers; some of these societies supplement, sometimes extensively, their foraging activity with farming or animal husbandry.

==Pastoralism==



Pastoral nomads are nomads moving between pastures. Nomadic pastoralism is thought to have developed in three stages that accompanied population growth and an increase in the complexity of social organization. Karim Sadr has proposed the following stages:
* Pastoralism: This is a mixed economy with a symbiosis within the family.
* Agropastoralism: This is when symbiosis is between segments or clans within an ethnic group.
* True Nomadism: This is when symbiosis is at the regional level, generally between specialised nomadic and agricultural populations.

The pastoralists are sedentary to a certain area, as they move between the permanent spring, summer, autumn and winter (or dry and wet season) pastures for their livestock. The nomads moved depending on the availability of resources.

===History===

====Origins====
Nomadic pastoralism seems to have developed first as a part of the secondary-products revolution proposed by Andrew Sherratt, in which early pre-pottery Neolithic cultures that had used animals as live meat (&quot;on the hoof&quot;) also began using animals for their secondary products, for example: milk and its associated dairy products, wool and other animal hair, hides (and consequently leather), manure (for fuel and fertilizer), and traction.

The first nomadic pastoral society developed in the period from 8,500 to 6,500 BCE in the area of the southern Levant. There, during a period of increasing aridity, Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) cultures in the Sinai were replaced by a nomadic, pastoral pottery-using culture, which seems to have been a cultural fusion between them and a newly-arrived Mesolithic people from Egypt (the Harifian culture), adopting their nomadic hunting lifestyle to the raising of stock.

This lifestyle quickly developed into what Jaris Yurins has called the circum-Arabian nomadic pastoral techno-complex and is possibly associated with the appearance of Semitic languages in the region of the Ancient Near East. The rapid spread of such nomadic pastoralism was typical of such later developments as of the Yamnaya culture of the horse and cattle nomads of the Eurasian steppe ( 3300–2600 BCE), and of the Mongol spread in the later Middle Ages.

Yamnaya steppe pastoralists from the Pontic–Caspian steppe, who were among the first to master horseback riding, played a key role in Indo-European migrations and in the spread of Indo-European languages across Eurasia.

Trekboers in southern Africa adopted nomadism from the 17th century.
Some elements of gaucho culture in colonial South America also re-invented nomadic lifestyles.

====Increase in post-Soviet Central Asia====
One of the results of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent political independence and economic collapse of its Central Asian republics has been the resurgence of pastoral nomadism. Taking the Kyrgyz people as a representative example, nomadism was the centre of their economy before Russian colonization at the turn of the 20th century, when they were settled into agricultural villages. The population became increasingly urbanized after World War II, but some people still take their herds of horses and cows to high pastures (&quot;jailoo&quot;) every summer, continuing a pattern of transhumance.

Since the 1990s, as the cash economy shrank, unemployed relatives were reabsorbed into family farms, and the importance of this form of nomadism has increased. The symbols of nomadism, specifically the crown of the grey felt tent known as the yurt, appears on the national flag, emphasizing the central importance of nomadism in the genesis of the modern nation of Kyrgyzstan.

====Sedentarization====

From 1920 to 2008, the population of nomadic pastoral tribes slowly decreased from over a quarter of Iran&#x27;s population. Tribal pastures were nationalized during the 1960s. The National Commission of UNESCO registered the population of Iran at 21 million in 1963, of whom two million (9.5%) were nomads. Although the nomadic population of Iran has dramatically decreased in the 20th century, Iran still has one of the largest nomadic populations in the world, an estimated 1.5 million in a country of about 70 million.

In Kazakhstan where the major agricultural activity was nomadic herding, forced collectivization under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule met with massive resistance and major losses and confiscation of livestock. Livestock in Kazakhstan fell from 7 million cattle to 1.6 million and from 22 million sheep to 1.7 million. The resulting famine of 1931–1934 caused some 1.5 million deaths: this represents more than 40% of the total Kazakh population at that time.

In the 1950s as well as the 1960s, large numbers of Bedouin throughout the Middle East started to leave the traditional, nomadic life to settle in the cities of the Middle East, especially as home ranges have shrunk and population levels have grown. Government policies in Egypt and Israel, oil production in Libya and the Persian Gulf, as well as a desire for improved standards of living, effectively led most Bedouin to become settled citizens of various nations, rather than stateless nomadic herders. A century ago, nomadic Bedouin still made up some 10% of the total Arab population. Today, they account for some 1% of the total.

At independence in 1960, Mauritania was essentially a nomadic society. The great Sahel droughts of the early 1970s caused massive problems in a country where 85% of its inhabitants were nomadic herders. Today only 15% remain nomads.

As many as 2 million nomadic Kuchis wandered over Afghanistan in the years before the Soviet invasion, and most experts agreed that by 2000 the number had fallen dramatically, perhaps by half. A severe drought had destroyed 80% of the livestock in some areas.

Niger experienced a serious food crisis in 2005 following erratic rainfall and desert locust invasions. Nomads such as the Tuareg and Fulani, who make up about 20% of Niger&#x27;s 12.9 million population, had been so badly hit by the Niger food crisis that their already fragile way of life is at risk. Nomads in Mali were also affected. The Fulani of West Africa are the world&#x27;s largest nomadic group.

=== Lifestyle ===

Pala nomads living in Western Tibet have a diet that is unusual in that they consume very few vegetables and no fruit. The main staple of their diet is &quot;tsampa&quot; and they drink Tibetan style butter tea. Pala will eat heartier foods in the winter months to help keep warm. Some of the customary restrictions they explain as cultural saying only that &quot;drokha&quot; do not eat certain foods, even some that may be naturally abundant. Though they live near sources of fish and fowl these do not play a significant role in their diet, and they do not eat carnivorous animals, rabbits or the wild asses that are abundant in the environs, classifying the latter as horse due to their cloven hooves. Some families do not eat until after the morning milking, while others may have a light meal with butter tea and &quot;tsampa&quot;. In the afternoon, after the morning milking, the families gather and share a communal meal of tea, &quot;tsampa&quot; and sometimes yogurt. During winter months the meal is more substantial and includes meat. Herders will eat before leaving the camp and most do not eat again until they return to camp for the evening meal. The typical evening meal may include thin stew with &quot;tsampa&quot;, animal fat and dried radish. Winter stew would include a lot of meat with either &quot;tsampa&quot; or boiled flour dumplings.

Nomadic diets in Kazakhstan have not changed much over centuries. The Kazakh nomad cuisine is simple and includes meat, salads, marinated vegetables and fried and baked breads. Tea is served in bowls, possibly with sugar or milk. Milk and other dairy products, like cheese and yogurt, are especially important. &quot;Kumys&quot; is a drink of fermented milk. Wrestling is a popular sport, but the nomadic people do not have much time for leisure. Horse riding is a valued skill in their culture.
=== Perception ===
Ann Marie Kroll Lerner states that the pastoral nomads were viewed as &quot;invading, destructive, and altogether antithetical to civilizing, sedentary societies&quot; during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Lerner, they are rarely accredited as &quot;a civilizing force&quot;.

Allan Hill and Sara Randall observe that western authors have looked for &quot;romance and mystery, as well as the repository of laudable characteristics believed lost in the West, such as independence, stoicism in the face of physical adversity, and a strong sense of loyalty to family and to tribe&quot; in nomadic pastoralist societies. Hill and Randall observe that nomadic pastoralists are stereotypically seen by the settled populace in Africa and Middle East as &quot;aimless wanderers, immoral, promiscuous and disease-ridden&quot; peoples. According to Hill and Randall, both of these perceptions &quot;misrepresent the reality&quot;.

== Contemporary peripatetic minorities in Eurasia ==

Peripatetic minorities are mobile populations moving among settled populations offering a craft or trade.

Each existing community is primarily endogamous, and subsists traditionally on a variety of commercial or service activities. Formerly, all or a majority of their members were itinerant, and this largely holds true today. Migration generally takes place within the political boundaries of a single state these days.

Each of the peripatetic communities is multilingual, it speaks one or more of the languages spoken by the local sedentary populations, and, additionally, within each group, a separate dialect or language is spoken. They are speaking languages of Indic origin and many are structured somewhat like an argot or secret language, with vocabularies drawn from various languages. There are indications that in northern Iran at least one community speaks Romani language, and some groups in Turkey also speak Romani.

==== India ====


==== Dom people ====

In Afghanistan, the Nausar worked as tinkers and animal dealers. Ghorbat men mainly made sieves, drums, and bird cages, and the women peddled these as well as other items of household and personal use; they also worked as moneylenders to rural women. Peddling and the sale of various goods was also practiced by men and women of various groups, such as the Jalali, the Pikraj, the Shadibaz, the Noristani, and the Vangawala. The latter and the Pikraj also worked as animal dealers. Some men among the Shadibaz and the Vangawala entertained as monkey or bear handlers and snake charmers; men and women among the Baluch were musicians and dancers. The Baluch men were warriors that were feared by neighboring tribes and often were used as mercenaries. Jogi men and women had diverse subsistence activities, such as dealing in horses, harvesting, fortune-telling, bloodletting, and begging.

In Iran, the Asheq of Azerbaijan, the Challi of Baluchistan, the Luti of Kurdistan, Kermānshāh, Īlām, and Lorestān, the Mehtar in the Mamasani district, the Sazandeh of Band-i Amir and Marv-dasht, and the Toshmal among the Bakhtyari pastoral groups worked as professional musicians. The men among the Kowli worked as tinkers, smiths, musicians, and monkey and bear handlers; they also made baskets, sieves, and brooms and dealt in donkeys. Their women made a living from peddling, begging, and fortune-telling.

The Ghorbat among the Basseri were smiths and tinkers, traded in pack animals, and made sieves, reed mats, and small wooden implements. In the Fārs region, the Qarbalband, the Kuli, and Luli were reported to work as smiths and to make baskets and sieves; they also dealt in pack animals, and their women peddled various goods among pastoral nomads. In the same region, the Changi and Luti were musicians and balladeers, and their children learned these professions from the age of 7 or 8 years.

The nomadic groups in Turkey make and sell cradles, deal in animals, and play music. The men of the sedentary groups work in towns as scavengers and hangmen; elsewhere they are fishermen, smiths, basket makers, and singers; their women dance at feasts and tell fortunes. Abdal men played music and made sieves, brooms, and wooden spoons for a living. The Tahtacı traditionally worked as lumberers; with increased sedentarization, however, they have taken to agriculture and horticulture.

Little is known for certain about the past of these communities; the history of each is almost entirely contained in their oral traditions. Although some groups—such as the Vangawala—are of Indian origin, some—like the Noristani—are most probably of local origin; still others probably migrated from adjoining areas. The Ghorbat and the Shadibaz claim to have originally come from Iran and Multan, respectively, and Tahtacı traditional accounts mention either Baghdad or Khorāsān as their original home. The Baluch say they were attached as a service community to the Jamshedi, after they fled Baluchistan because of feuds.

==== Kochi people ====
==== Yörüks ====

Still some groups such as Sarıkeçililer continues nomadic lifestyle between coastal towns Mediterranean and Taurus Mountains even though most of them were settled by both late Ottoman and Turkish republic.

==== Bukat People of Borneo ====
The Bukat people of Borneo in Malaysia live within the region of the river Mendalam, which the natives call Buköt. Bukat is an ethnonym that encapsulates all the tribes in the region. These natives are historically self-sufficient but were also known to trade various goods. This is especially true for the clans who lived on the periphery of the territory. The products of their trade were varied and fascinating, including: &quot;...resins (damar, &quot;Agathis dammara; jelutong bukit, Dyera costulata,&quot; gutta-percha, &quot;Palaquium&quot; spp.); wild honey and beeswax (important in trade but often unreported); aromatic resin from insence wood (&quot;gaharu, Aquilaria microcarpa);&quot; camphor (found in the fissures of &quot;Dryobalanops aromaticus);&quot; several types of rotan of cane (&quot;Calamus rotan&quot; and other species); poison for blowpipe darts (one source is &quot;ipoh&quot; or &quot;ipu&quot;: see Nieuwenhuis 1900a:137); the antlers of deer (the sambar, &quot;Cervus unicolor);&quot; rhinoceros horn (see Tillema 1939:142); pharmacologically valuable bezoar stones (concretions formed in the intestines and gallbladder of the gibbon, &quot;Seminopithecus,&quot; and in the wounds of porcupines, &quot;Hestrix crassispinus);&quot; birds&#x27; nests, the edible nests of swifts (&quot;Collocalia&quot; spp.); the heads and feathers of two species of hornbills (&quot;Buceros rhinoceros, Rhinoplax vigil)&quot;; and various hides (clouded leopards, bears, and other animals).&quot; These nomadic tribes also commonly hunted boar with poison blow darts for their own needs.

<doc id="89914" wikidata="Q246090" url="?curid=89914" title="Cystoscopy">
<text>Cystoscopy is endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra. It is carried out with a cystoscope.

The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
The cystoscope has lenses like a telescope or microscope. These lenses let the physician focus on the inner surfaces of the urinary tract. Some cystoscopes use optical fibres (flexible glass fibres) that carry an image from the tip of the instrument to a viewing piece at the other end. Cystoscopes range from pediatric to adult and from the thickness of a pencil up to approximately 9 mm and have a light at the tip. Many cystoscopes have extra tubes to guide other instruments for surgical procedures to treat urinary problems.

There are two main types of cystoscopy—flexible and rigid—differing in the flexibility of the cystoscope. Flexible cystoscopy is carried out with local anaesthesia on both sexes. Typically, a topical anesthetic, most often xylocaine gel (common brand names are Anestacon and Instillagel) is employed. The medication is instilled into the urethra via the urinary meatus five to ten minutes prior to the beginning of the procedure. Rigid cystoscopy can be performed under the same conditions, but is generally carried out under general anesthesia, particularly in male subjects, due to the pain caused by the probe. The sizes of the sheath of the rigid cystoscope are 17 French gauge (5.7 mm diameter), 19 Fr gauge (6.3 mm diameter), and 22 Fr gauge (7.3 mm diameter).

== Medical uses ==
Cystoscopy may be recommended for any of the following conditions:
* urinary tract infections;
* blood in the urine (hematuria);
* loss of bladder control (incontinence) or overactive bladder; (Although, the American Urogynecologic Society does not recommend that cystoscopy, urodynamics, or diagnostic renal and bladder ultrasound are part of initial diagnosis for uncomplicated overactive bladder.)
* unusual cells found in urine sample;
* need for a bladder catheter;
* painful urination, chronic pelvic pain, or interstitial cystitis;
* urinary blockage such as from prostate enlargement, stricture, or narrowing of the urinary tract;
* stone in the urinary tract; and
* unusual growth, polyp, tumor, or cancer.

== Male and female urinary tracts ==
If a patient has a stone lodged higher in the urinary tract, the physician may use a much finer calibre scope called a ureteroscope through the bladder and up into the ureter. (The ureter is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder.) The physician can then see the stone and remove it with a small basket at the end of a wire that is inserted through an extra tube in the ureteroscope. For larger stones, the physician may also use the extra tube in the ureteroscope to extend a flexible fiber that carries a laser beam to break the stone into smaller pieces that can then pass out of the body in the urine.

== Test procedures ==

Physicians may have special instructions, but in most cases, patients are able to eat normally and return to normal activities after the test. Patients are sometimes asked to give a urine sample before the test to check for infection. These patients should ensure that they do not urinate for a sufficient period of time, such that they are able to urinate prior to this part of the test.

Patients will have to remove their clothing covering the lower part of the body, although some physicians may prefer if the patient wears a hospital gown for the examination and covers the lower part of the body with a sterile drape. In most cases, patients lie on their backs with their knees slightly parted. Occasionally, a patient may also need to have his or her knees raised. This is particularly true when undergoing a Rigid Cystoscopy examination. For flexible cystoscopy procedures the patient is almost always alert and a local anesthetic is applied to reduce discomfort. In cases requiring a rigid cystoscopy it is not unusual for the patient to be given a general anesthetic, as these can be more uncomfortable, particularly for men. A physician, nurse, or technician will clean the area around the urethral opening and apply a local anesthetic. The local anesthetic is applied direct from a tube or needleless syringe into the urinary tract. Often, skin preparation is performed with chlorhexidine.

Patients receiving a ureteroscopy may receive a spinal or general anaesthetic.

The physician will gently insert the tip of the cystoscope into the urethra and slowly glide it up into the bladder. The procedure is more painful for men than for women due to the length and narrow diameter of the male urethra, and results of a 2019 systematic review of the literature found that intraurethral lidocaine greatly reduces this painful procedure in men. Relaxing the pelvic muscles helps make this part of the test easier. A sterile liquid (water, saline, or glycine solution) will flow through the cystoscope to slowly fill the bladder and stretch it so that the physician has a better view of the bladder wall.

As the bladder reaches capacity, patients typically feel some mild discomfort and the urge to urinate.

The time from insertion of the cystoscope to removal may be only a few minutes, or it may be longer if the physician finds a stone and decides to remove it, or in cases where a biopsy is required. Taking a biopsy (a small tissue sample for examination under a microscope) will also make the procedure last longer. In most cases, the entire examination, including preparation, will take about 15 to 20 minutes.

=== Blue light ===

In blue light cystoscopy hexyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride is instilling a photosensitizing agent, into the bladder. The blue light cystoscopy contains a light source and light is transmitted through a fluid light cable connected to an endoscope to light up the area to be observed. The photosensitizing agent preferentially accumulates porphyrins in malignant cells as opposed to nonmalignant cells of urothelial origin. Under subsequent blue light illumination, neoplastic lesions fluoresce red, enabling visualization of tumors. The blue light cystoscopy is used to detect non-muscle invasive papillary cancer of the bladder.

== Indications before and after the procedure ==

=== Before the procedure ===
Prior to the early 1990s, it was common practice for the physician performing the procedure to prescribe an antibiotic to take for a few days to prevent an infection. Since that time, many urologists will order a &quot;urine C &amp; S&quot; (urinalysis with bacterial/fungal cultures and testing for sensitivities to anti-infective medications) prior to the performance of the cystoscopy, and as part of the pre-operative workup. Depending on the results of the testing and other circumstances, he or she may elect to prescribe a 10- to 14-day course of antibiotic or other anti-infective treatment, commencing 3 days before the cystoscopy is to be performed, as this may alleviate some inflammation of the urethra prior to the procedure.

This practice may provide an additional benefit by preventing an accidental infection from occurring during the procedure. When antibiotics are given for UTI prevention in adults undergoing a cystoscopy, they may reduce the risk of infections that go into the bloodstream and infections limited to the bladder. However, antibiotics may have little to no effect on only the risk of serious infections that go in the bloodstream. From review data, antibiotics do not appear to cause serious unwanted side effects or affect the occurrence of minor side effects, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. The full-course of antibiotic treatment also lessens the possibility of the bacteria becoming resistant to the antibiotic/anti-infective agent prescribed.

Physicians may also prescribe an oral urinary analgesic, phenazopyridine, or a combination (urinary) analgesic/anti-infective/anti-spasmodic medication containing methylene blue, methanamine, hyoscyamine sulfate and phenyl salicylate for irritation and/or dysuria patients may experience after the procedure. At two weeks post-procedure, the practitioner may order a follow-up evaluation including a repeat of the urinalysis with cultures and sensitivities, and a uroflowmetric study (which evaluates the volume of urine released from the body, the speed with which it is released, and how long the release takes)

=== After the procedure ===
Patients often experience a burning sensation during urination and often see small amounts of blood in their urine. Procedures using rigid instrumentation more frequently result in short-term urinary incontinence and leakage due to urethral damage. Occasionally, patients may feel some lower abdominal pains, reflecting bladder muscle spasms, but these are not common.

Common (non-invasive) prescriptions to relieve discomfort after the test may include:
* drinking 32 fluid ounces (1 L) of water over 2 hours;
* taking a warm bath to relieve the burning feeling; and
* holding a warm, damp washcloth over the urethral opening.

== Other animals ==

Cystoscopy has similar indications in animals, including visualisation and biopsy of mucosa, retrieval or destruction of urinary bladder stones and diagnosis of ectopic ureters.

In turtle and tortoises, cystoscopy has additional value as it permits the visualisation of internal organs due to the thin urinary bladder wall. In young individuals in which sex determination would not be feasible by visualisation of external morphologic features, this technique permits noninvasive visualisation of gonads, and therefore sex determination.

<doc id="89918" wikidata="Q3924050" url="?curid=89918" title="Field-emission electric propulsion">
<text>Field-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) is an advanced electrostatic space propulsion concept, a form of ion thruster, that uses a liquid metal as a propellant – usually either caesium, indium, or mercury.

A FEEP device consists of an emitter and an accelerator electrode. A potential difference of the order of 10 kV is applied between the two, which generates a strong electric field at the tip of the metal surface. The interplay of electric force and the liquid metal&#x27;s surface tension generates surface instabilities, which give rise to Taylor cones on the liquid surface. At sufficiently high values of the applied field, ions are extracted from the cone tip by field evaporation or similar mechanisms, which then are electrically accelerated to high velocities – typically 100 km/s or more. Although the ion exhaust velocity is high, their mass is very low, resulting in very weak acceleration forces. Their benefit comes from sustained acceleration forces over long time periods.

Due to its very low thrust (in the micronewton (μN) to millinewton (mN) range), FEEP thrusters are primarily used for microradian, micronewton attitude control on spacecraft, such as in the ESA/NASA LISA Pathfinder scientific spacecraft. 
The FEEP thruster was also slated for installation on Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer spacecraft, but the Gridded ion thruster was used instead.
The first FEEP thruster operated in space was the IFM Nano Thruster, successfully commissioned in Low Earth Orbit in 2018.

==Basic concept==
Field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) is an electrostatic propulsion method based on field ionization of a liquid metal, and subsequent acceleration of the ions by a strong electric field. Sharp features such as needles are used to enhance and concentrate the strength of this electric field. The needle is coated in the liquid metal, maximising the acceleration of the ions.

FEEP is currently the object of interest in the scientific community, due to its unique features: sub-μN to mN thrust range, near instantaneous switch on/switch off capability, and high-resolution throttleability (better than one part in 104), which enables accurate thrust modulation in both continuous and pulsed modes. Presently baseline for scientific missions onboard drag-free satellites, this propulsion system has also been proposed for attitude control and orbit maintenance on commercial small satellites and constellations.

A separate electron source is required to keep the spacecraft electrically neutral.

==Liquid-metal propellants==
This type of thruster can accelerate a large number of different liquid metals or alloys. The best performance (in terms of thrust efficiency and power-to-thrust ratio) can be obtained using high atomic weight alkali metals, such as cesium (Cs, 133 amu) and rubidium (Rb, 85.5 amu). These propellants have a low ionization potential (3.87 eV for Cs and 4.16 eV for Rb), low melting point (28.7 °C for Cs and 38.9 °C for Rb) and very good wetting capabilities.

These features lead to low power losses due to ionization and heating and the capability to use capillary forces for feeding purposes, i.e., neither pressurised tanks nor valves are required. Moreover, alkali metals have the lowest attitude to form ionized droplets or multiply-charged ions, thus leading to the best attainable mass efficiency. The actual thrust is produced by exhausting a beam consisting mainly of singly-ionized cesium or rubidium atoms, produced by field evaporation at the tip of the emitter.

An accelerating electrode (accelerator) is placed directly in front of the emitter. This electrode consists of a metal (usually stainless steel) plate where two sharp blades are machined. When thrust is required, a strong electric field is generated by the application of a high voltage difference between the emitter and the accelerator. Under this condition, the free surface of the liquid metal enters a regime of local instability, due to the combined effects of the electrostatic force and the surface tension. A series of protruding cusps, or &quot;Taylor cones&quot; are thus created. When the electric field reaches a value in the order of 109 V/m, the atoms at the tip of the cusps spontaneously ionize and an ion jet is extracted by the electric field, while the electrons are rejected in the bulk of the liquid. An external source of electrons (neutralizer) provides negative charges to maintain global electrical neutrality of the thruster assembly.

==Slit emitter==
Liquid metal ion sources (LMIS) based on field ionization or field evaporation were introduced in the late &#x27;60s and quickly became widespread as simple, cheap ion sources for a number of applications, and in 1972 the European Space Agency started development on an electric propulsion system based on the field emission principle using liquid metal ion sources. The use of LMIS operated on gallium, indium, alkali metals or alloys has also been standard practice in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) since the 1970s.

While there exist different field emitter configurations, such as the needle, the capillary and slit emitter types, the principle of operation is the same in all cases. In the slit emitter, for example, a liquid metal propellant is fed by capillary forces through a narrow channel. The emitter consists of two identical halves made from stainless steel, and clamped or screwed together. A nickel layer, sputter deposited onto one of the emitter halves, outlines the desired channel contour and determines channel height (a.k.a. slit height, typically 1–2 μm) and channel width (a.k.a. &quot;slit length&quot;, which ranges from 1 mm up to about 7 cm). The channel ends at the emitter tip, formed by sharp edges that are located opposite a negative, or accelerator, electrode, and separated by a small gap (about 0.6 mm) from the emitter tip. An extraction voltage is applied between the two electrodes. The emitter carries a positive potential while the accelerator is at negative potential. The electric field being generated between the emitter and accelerator now acts on the liquid metal propellant.

The narrow slit width not only enables the capillary feed, but, when combined with the sharp channel edges directly opposite the accelerator, also ensures that a high electric field strength is obtained near the slit exit. The liquid metal column, when subjected to this electric field, begins to deform, forming cusps (Taylor cones), which protrude from the surface of the liquid. As the liquid cusps form ever sharper cones due to the action of the electric field, the local electric field strength near these cusps intensifies. Once a local electric field strength of about 109 V/m is reached, electrons are ripped off the metal atoms. These electrons are collected through the liquid metal column by the channel walls, and the positive ions are accelerated away from the liquid through a gap in the negative accelerator electrode by the same electric field that created them.

Slit emitters had been developed to increase the emitting area of the thruster in order to yield higher thrust levels and to avoid the irregular behaviour observed for single emitters. The substantial advantage of slit emitters over stacked needles is in the self-adjusting mechanism governing the formation and redistribution of emission sites on the liquid metal surface according to the operating parameters; in a stacked-needle array, on the contrary, the Taylor cones can only exist on the fixed tips, which pre-configure a geometrical arrangement that can only be consistent with one particular operating condition.

==Other designs==
Slit emitters with a wide variety of slit widths have been fabricated; currently, devices with slit widths between 2 mm and 7 cm are available. These devices, spanning a thrust range from 0.1 μN to 2 mN, are operated with cesium or rubidium.

The miniaturized FEEP module design with a crown-shape emitter to fit into the standard CubeSat chassis was reported in 2017.

The single-emitter FEEP design of 0.5 mN is commercially available, and its arrayed version development is nearing completion as in 2018.

<text>Dunkirk ( , , ; Picard: Dunkèke; ; or ) is a major port city in the department of Nord in northern France. It lies from the Belgian border. It has the third-largest French harbour. The population of the commune in 2019 was 86,279.

==Etymology and language use==
The name of Dunkirk derives from West Flemish &#x27;dune&#x27; or &#x27;dun&#x27; and &#x27;church&#x27;, thus &#x27;church in the dunes&#x27;. A smaller town 25 km (15 miles) farther up the Flemish coast originally shared the same name, but was later renamed Oostduinkerke(n) in order to avoid confusion.

Until the middle of the 20th century, French Flemish (the local variety of Dutch) was commonly spoken.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
A fishing village arose late in the tenth century, in the originally flooded coastal area of the English Channel south of the Western Scheldt, when the area was held by the Counts of Flanders, vassals of the French Crown. About AD 960, Count Baldwin III had a town wall erected in order to protect the settlement against Viking raids. The surrounding wetlands were drained and cultivated by the monks of nearby Bergues Abbey. The name &quot;Dunkirka&quot; was first mentioned in a tithe privilege of 27 May 1067, issued by Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Count Philip I (1157–1191) brought further large tracts of marshland under cultivation, laid out the first plans to build a Canal from Dunkirk to Bergues and vested the Dunkirkers with market rights.

In the late 13th century, when the Dampierre count Guy of Flanders entered into the Franco-Flemish War against his suzerain King Philippe IV of France, the citizens of Dunkirk sided with the French against their count, who at first was defeated at the 1297 Battle of Furnes, but reached &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy upon the victorious Battle of the Golden Spurs five years later and exacted vengeance. Guy&#x27;s son, Count Robert III (1305–1322), nevertheless granted further city rights to Dunkirk; his successor Count Louis I (1322–1346) had to face the Peasant revolt of 1323–1328, which was crushed by King Philippe VI of France at the 1328 Battle of Cassel, whereafter the Dunkirkers again were affected by the repressive measures of the French king.

Count Louis remained a loyal vassal of the French king upon the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War with England in 1337, and prohibited the maritime trade, which led to another revolt by the Dunkirk citizens. After the count had been killed in the 1346 Battle of Crécy, his son and successor Count Louis II of Flanders (1346–1384) signed a truce with the English; the trade again flourished and the port was significantly enlarged. However, in the course of the Western Schism from 1378, English supporters of Pope Urban VI (the Roman claimant) disembarked at Dunkirk, captured the city and flooded the surrounding estates. They were ejected by King Charles VI of France, but left great devastations in and around the town.

Upon the extinction of the Counts of Flanders with the death of Louis II in 1384, Flanders was acquired by the Burgundian, Duke Philip the Bold. The fortifications were again enlarged, including the construction of a belfry daymark (a navigational aid similar to a non-illuminated lighthouse). As a strategic point, Dunkirk has always been exposed to political greed, by Duke Robert I of Bar in 1395, by Louis de Luxembourg in 1435 and finally by the Austrian archduke Maximilian I of Habsburg, who in 1477 married Mary of Burgundy, sole heiress of late Duke Charles the Bold. As Maximilian was the son of Emperor Frederick III, all Flanders was immediately seized by King Louis XI of France. However, the archduke defeated the French troops in 1479 at the Battle of Guinegate. When Mary died in 1482, Maximilian retained Flanders according to the terms of the 1482 Treaty of Arras. Dunkirk, along with the rest of Flanders, was incorporated into the Habsburg Netherlands and upon the 1581 secession of the Seven United Netherlands, remained part of the Southern Netherlands, which were held by Habsburg Spain (Spanish Netherlands) as Imperial fiefs.

===Corsair base===


The area remained much disputed between Spain, the Netherlands, England and France. At the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Dunkirk was briefly in the hands of the Dutch rebels, from 1577. Spanish forces under Duke Alexander Farnese of Parma re-established Spanish rule in 1583 and it became a base for the notorious &quot;Dunkirkers&quot;. The Dunkirkers briefly lost their home port when the city was conquered by the French in 1646 but Spanish forces recaptured the city in 1652. In 1658, as a result of the long war between France and Spain, it was captured after a siege by Franco-English forces following the battle of the Dunes. The city along with Fort-Mardyck was awarded to England in the peace the following year as agreed in the Franco-English alliance against Spain. The English governors were Sir William Lockhart (1658–60), Sir Edward Harley (1660–61) and Lord Rutherford (1661–62).

On 17 October 1662, Dunkirk was sold to France by Charles II of England for £320,000. The French government developed the town as a fortified port. The town&#x27;s existing defences were adapted to create ten bastions. The port was expanded in the 1670s by the construction of a basin that could hold up to thirty warships with a double lock system to maintain water levels at low tide. The basin was linked to the sea by a channel dug through coastal sandbanks secured by two jetties. This work was completed by 1678. The jetties were defended a few years later by the construction of five forts, Château d&#x27;Espérance, Château Vert, Grand Risban, Château Gaillard, and Fort de Revers. An additional fort was built in 1701 called Fort Blanc.

During the reign of Louis XIV, a large number of commerce raiders and pirates once again made their base at Dunkirk, the most famous of whom was Jean Bart. The main character (and possible real prisoner) in the famous novel Man in the Iron Mask by Alexandre Dumas was arrested at Dunkirk. The eighteenth-century Swedish privateers and pirates Lars Gathenhielm and his wife Ingela Hammar are known to have sold their gains in Dunkirk.

As France and Great Britain became commercial and military rivals, the British grew concerned about Dunkirk being used as an invasion base to cross the English Channel. The jetties, their forts, and the port facilities were demolished in 1713 under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht. The Treaty of Paris of 1763, which concluded the Seven Years&#x27; War, included a clause restricting French rights to fortify Dunkirk. This clause was overturned in the subsequent Treaty of Versailles of 1783.

===Dunkirk in World War I===
Dunkirk&#x27;s port was used extensively during the war by British forces who brought in dock workers from, among other places, Egypt and China.

From 1915, the city experienced severe bombardment, including from the largest gun in the world in 1917, the German &#x27;Lange Max&#x27;. On a regular basis, heavy shells weighing approximately 750 kg (1700 lb) were fired from Koekelare, about 45–50 km (30 miles) away. The bombardment killed nearly 600 people and wounded another 1,100, both civilian and military, while 400 buildings were destroyed and 2,400 damaged. The city&#x27;s population, which had been 39,000 in 1914, reduced to fewer than 15,000 in July 1916 and 7,000 in the autumn of 1917.

In January 1916, a spy scare took place in Dunkirk. The writer Robert W. Service, then a war correspondent for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, was mistakenly arrested as a spy and narrowly avoided being executed out of hand. On 1 January 1918, the United States Navy established a naval air station to operate seaplanes. The base closed shortly after the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

In October 1917, to mark the gallant behaviour of its inhabitants during the war, the City of Dunkirk was awarded the and, in 1919, the Legion of Honour and the British Distinguished Service Cross. These decorations now appear in the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Dunkirk in World War II===

====Evacuation====

During the Second World War 1940 Battle of France, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), while aiding the French and Belgian armies, were forced to retreat in the face of overpowering German Panzer attacks. Fighting in Belgium and France, the BEF and a portion of the French Army became outflanked by the Germans and retreated to the area around the port of Dunkirk. More than 400,000 soldiers were trapped in the pocket as the German Army closed in for the kill. Unexpectedly, the German Panzer attack halted for several days at a critical juncture. For years, it was assumed that Adolf Hitler ordered the German Army to suspend the attack, favouring bombardment by the Luftwaffe. However, according to the Official War Diary of Army Group A, its commander, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Gerd von Rundstedt, ordered the halt to allow maintenance on his tanks, half of which were out of service, and to protect his flanks which were exposed and, he thought, vulnerable. Hitler merely validated the order several hours later. This lull gave the British and French a few days to fortify their defences. The Allied position was complicated by Belgian King Leopold III&#x27;s surrender on 27 May, which was postponed until 28 May. The gap left by the Belgian Army stretched from Ypres to Dixmude. Nevertheless, a collapse was prevented, making it possible to launch an evacuation by sea, across the English Channel, codenamed Operation Dynamo. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered any ship or boat available, large or small, to collect the stranded soldiers. 338,226 men (including 123,000 French soldiers) were evacuated – the &quot;miracle of Dunkirk&quot;, as Churchill called it. It took over 900 vessels to evacuate the BEF, with two-thirds of those rescued embarking via the harbour, and over 100,000 taken off the beaches. More than 40,000 vehicles as well as massive amounts of other military equipment and supplies were left behind. Forty thousand Allied soldiers (some who carried on fighting after the official evacuation) were captured or forced to make their own way home through a variety of routes including via neutral Spain. Many wounded who were unable to walk were abandoned.

====Liberation====

Dunkirk was again contested in 1944, with the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attempting to liberate the city in September, as Allied forces surged northeast after their victory in the Battle of Normandy. However, German forces refused to relinquish their control of the city, which had been converted into a fortress. To seize the now strategically insignificant town would consume too many Allied resources which were needed elsewhere. The town was by-passed masking the German garrison with Allied troops, notably the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade. During the German occupation, Dunkirk was largely destroyed by Allied bombing. The artillery siege of Dunkirk was directed on the final day of the war by pilots from No. 652 Squadron RAF, and No. 665 Squadron RCAF. The fortress, under the command of German Admiral Friedrich Frisius, eventually unconditionally surrendered to the commander of the Czechoslovak forces, Brigade General Alois Liška, on 9 May 1945.

===Postwar Dunkirk===
On 14 December 2002, the Norwegian car carrier collided with the Bahamian-registered &quot;Kariba&quot; and sank off Dunkirk Harbour, causing a hazard to navigation in the English Channel.

==Population==

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Dunkirk proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Dunkirk absorbed the former commune of Malo-les-Bains in 1969, Rosendaël and Petite-Synthe in 1971, Mardyck in 1979 and Fort-Mardyck and Saint-Pol-sur-Mer in 2010.

==Politics==
Dunkirk is part of Nord&#x27;s 13th constituency, The current Member of Parliament is Christine Decodts of the miscellaneous centre.

=== Presidential elections second round ===

==Heraldry==
==Administration==
The commune has grown substantially by absorbing several neighbouring communes:

* 1970: Merger with Malo-les-Bains (which had been created by being detached from Dunkirk in 1881)
* 1972: Fusion with Petite-Synthe and Rosendaël (the latter had been created by being detached from Téteghem in 1856)
* 1980: Fusion-association with Mardyck (which became an associated commune, with a population of 372 in 1999)
* 1980: A large part of Petite-Synthe is detached from Dunkirk and included into Grande-Synthe
* 2010: After a failed fusion-association attempt with Saint-Pol-sur-Mer and Fort-Mardyck in 2003, both successfully become associated communes with Dunkirk in December 2010.

==Economy==
Dunkirk has the third-largest harbour in France, after those of Le Havre and Marseille. As an industrial city, it depends heavily on the steel, food processing, oil-refining, ship-building and chemical industries.

==Cuisine==
The cuisine of Dunkirk closely resembles Flemish cuisine; perhaps one of the best known dishes is &quot;coq à la bière&quot; – chicken in a creamy beer sauce.

==Prototype metre==

In June 1792 the French astronomers Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre and Pierre François André Méchain set out to measure the meridian arc distance from Dunkirk to Barcelona, two cities lying on approximately the same longitude as each other and also the longitude through Paris. The belfry was chosen as the reference point in Dunkirk.

Using this measurement and the latitudes of the two cities they could calculate the distance between the North Pole and the Equator in classical French units of length and hence produce the first prototype metre which was defined as being one ten millionth of that distance. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799.

Dunkirk was the most easterly cross-channel measuring point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which used triangulation to calculate the precise distance between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Sightings were made of signal lights at Dover Castle from the Dunkirk Belfry, and vice versa.

==Tourist attractions==
Two belfries in Dunkirk (the belfry near the Church of Saint-Éloi and the one at the Hôtel de Ville) are part of a group of belfries of Belgium and France, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005 in recognition of their civic architecture and importance in the rise of municipal power in Europe.

The 63-meter-high Dunkirk Lighthouse, also known as the Risban Light, was built between 1838 and 1843 as part of early efforts to place lights around the coast of France. At the time of its construction it was one of only two first order lighthouses (the other being Calais) to be set up in a port. Automated since 1985, the light can be seen 28 nautical miles (48 km) away. In 2010 it was listed as an historical monument.

Two museums in Dunkirk include:
* The &quot;Musée Portuaire&quot;, which displays exhibits of images about the history and presence of the port.
* The &quot;Musée des Beaux-Arts&quot;, which has a large collection of Flemish, Italian and French paintings and sculptures.

==Transport==
Dunkirk has a ferry route to Dover that is run by DFDS, which serves as an alternative to the route to the service to nearby Calais. The Dover-Dunkirk ferry route takes two hours compared to Dover-Calais&#x27; 1 hour 30 minutes, is run by three vessels and runs every two hours from Dunkirk. Another DFDS route connects Dunkirk to Rosslare Europort in the Republic of Ireland and carries truck freight as well as a limited number of private car passengers. The Dunkirk-Rosslare route take 24 hours and is run by the MF &quot;Regina Seaways&quot;.

The Gare de Dunkerque railway station offers connections to Gare de Calais-Ville, Gare de Lille Flandres, Arras and Paris, and several regional destinations in France. The railway line from Dunkirk to De Panne and Adinkerke, Belgium, is closed and has been dismantled in places.

In September 2018, Dunkirk&#x27;s public transit service introduced free public transport, thereby becoming the largest city in Europe to do so. Several weeks after the scheme had been introduced, the city&#x27;s mayor, Patrice Vergriete, reported that there had been 50% increase in passenger numbers on some routes, and up to 85% on others. As part of the transition towards offering free bus services, the city&#x27;s fleet was expanded from 100 to 140 buses, including new vehicles which run on natural gas. The Dunkirk free public transport initiative, initially lauded for its bold ambition, saw a significant decline in ridership after the initial surge. While the first three months post-launch demonstrated a dramatic increase in usage, with some lines experiencing up to 120% higher demand on weekends, the system faced substantial challenges. By the end of the first three months, ridership plummeted by 73% from its peak, eventually stabilizing at only 12% more than pre-pandemic levels (2019-2020). This decline was primarily due to the inability of the public transport infrastructure to handle the overwhelming demand, leading to overcrowding, delays, and reduced service quality. Despite these issues, Dunkirk’s free transport program remains operational, albeit limited to weekends, a marked reduction from its original full-time service. This scaling back underscores the difficulties in maintaining such an ambitious project, with financial constraints and logistical inefficiencies contributing to its partial rollback. While the program succeeded in increasing mobility for low-income residents and reducing car usage initially, its long-term sustainability has been questioned, casting doubt on its viability as a model for other cities. (https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/after-becoming-largest-european-city-to-offer-free-public-transit-theyre-enjoying-a-revolution-from-their-buses/), https://theconversation.com/in-the-french-city-of-dunkirk-free-public-transport-has-led-to-more-walking-and-cycling-127411, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-14/free-public-transit-can-it-work-in-every-city)
 As of August 2019, approximately 5% of 2000 people surveyed had used the free bus service to completely replace their cars.

<text>Babina is a cantonment town in Jhansi district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Shree Rajeev Singh Parichha is MLA of Babina constituency.

==Etymology==
It is said that Babina is an anacronym originating from &quot;British Army Base in North Asia&quot;. While this has been endorsed by the Cantonment Board of Babina, it appears to be a backronym that has been endorsed without due verification. Contrary to what the alleged anacronym suggests, the cantonment at Babina had no association with the British Raj and was opened in 1959, 12 years after the British left India. Furthermore, India is considered to be a part of South Asia, not North Asia as the acronym suggests. This suggests that the popular anacronym is very likely a modern invention.

==Indian Army==
Jhansi district is the headquarters of the 31st Indian Armoured Division, stationed at Jhansi-Babina. It is an armored division which has equipment like M3 Lee [Historian] and M4 Sherman tanks [Historian]. There was a joint exercise in 2012 with the Singaporean Army at Jhansi witnessed by the President of India, Pratibha Patil. In 2019 the Indian army held a joint exercise with the Russian army at Babina Battlefield, involving T-90, &#x27;Arjun&#x27;, and T-72 tanks.

<text>The Road to Mars is a 1999 science fiction comedic novel by Eric Idle.

==Plot summary==
Told from the point of view of Professor Bill Reynolds, a scholar in the then-fictitious discipline of micropaleontology, this novel is set in the 24th and 25th centuries, when the Solar System has been colonised. Reynolds is writing a thesis on fame and in his research discovers a dissertation on comedy submitted by Carlton, a robotic secretary for two stand-up comedians on an interplanetary comedy circuit. Most of the action in the novel follows this trio&#x27;s adventures during the time when Reynolds believes Carlton was developing his theories. During this time, Carlton and his owners, Alex Muscroft and Lewis Ashby get caught up in a series of disasters including loss of work, parental responsibility and close scrapes with terrorists, the law, other entertainers, and a refugee crisis.

Carlton seeks to understand the nature of comedy and human laughter, and attempts to describe humor as a mathematical formula.

==Characters==
Professor Bill Reynolds: The story&#x27;s narrator, who is writing a thesis on fame.

Carlton: A &quot;Bowie&quot; robotic secretary owned by a comedy duo. He is of a now-obsolete series based on David Bowie, with one green and one blue eye, with Carlton&#x27;s particular model, the 4.5, being based on Bowie circa 1983. He is studying his owners as part of his research on comedy.

Alex Muscroft: The comedian who bought Carlton, and sees him like a person much more than most of the human cast, having a concern and affection for him not commonly shown towards robots. Short with short red hair, a ruddy complexion in appearance, loud and personable in temperament. Carlton describes him in his thesis as having the boisterous troublemaking slapstick qualities of his &quot;Red Nose&quot; comic archetype.

Lewis Ashby: Alex&#x27;s comedy partner, he is tall, skinny, has thinning black hair and is gruff and introverted. Carlton describes him in his thesis as having the grave deadpan and somewhat cruel qualities of the &quot;White Face&quot; comic archetype.

Katy Wallace: A mysterious woman who befriends Alex.

Tay: Lewis&#x27;s daughter

Keppler: Owner of the space liner the &quot;Princess Di&quot;

Brenda Wooley: An aging pop-star who is still popular in the outer Solar System, and Keppler&#x27;s wife.

The Amazing Keith: A comedy-magician whose act utilizes explosives.

Boo: Another comedian, he appears to be somewhat mad, providing a contrast to the story&#x27;s other somewhat more professionally minded comedians.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Road to Mars&quot; received positive reviews, being described as &quot;a joy to read&quot; by Devon Thomas in &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

<doc id="89967" wikidata="Q2890963" url="?curid=89967" title="Shithead (card game)">
<text>Shithead (also called Karma, Palace or Shed) is a card game, the object of which is to lose all of one&#x27;s playing cards. There are many regional variations to the game&#x27;s original rules.

== History and name ==
The game became popular among backpackers in the late 20th century.

== Cards ==
A standard 52-card pack with French suit symbols is used. All other cards rank in their natural order. Aces are high, and suits are disregarded.

== Deal ==
From a shuffled deck of cards, the dealer gives each player nine cards: three downcards in a row, three upcards on top of the downcards, and three hand cards. The upcards can only be played once the hand cards have been exhausted, and the downcards can only be played once the upcards have been played

== Rearranging ==
After the deal and before play begins, players may switch their hand cards with those face up on the table in order to produce a strong set of upcards (ideally high cards, 2s or 10s) for later in the game.

== Play ==
Eldest hand is the first player dealt a 3 as an upcard. If no player has 3 face up, then the first player to declare a 3 in hand starts. If no-one has a 3, then the game is started by the person dealt a 4, etc. Eldest leads off by playing a card or set of cards face up in the middle of the table to start a common wastepile. In turn and in clockwise order, players play a card or set that is equal to or higher in rank than the top card of the wastepile. If unable or unwilling to do so, they must pick up the wastepile and add it to their hand cards.

Each player must have at least three cards in hand at all times; a player who has fewer than three after playing to the wastepile draws cards from the stock, if possible, to make the hand up to three again.

=== Special cards and quartets ===
Deuces (2s), tens and four-of-a-kind quartets have special roles:

* &quot;Deuces&quot;. A deuce may be played on any card and any card may follow a deuce.
* &quot;Tens&quot;. A ten may be played on any turn, regardless of the top card on the wastepile or even if there is no wastepile card. When a ten is played, the wastepile is removed from play and set aside for the remainder of the game. The same player then plays any card or set to begin a new wastepile.
* &quot;Quartets&quot;. A quartet is a set of four cards of equal rank e.g. or . If a player is able to play a quartet, the wastepile is set aside as if a ten had been played. In addition, the last player to complete a quartet on the top of the wastepile by playing its fourth card also removes the wastepile. Either way, the same player may then play another card or set.

== Endgame ==

A player who has no more cards in hand when the stock is empty must play from their upcards. If unable or unwilling to play an upcard, the player must pick up the wastepile. Once all of the upcards have been played, a player must then play downcards. These are played unseen one at a time and if the chosen card is lower than the previous card played, the wastepile must be picked up and, on subsequent turns, the player must play their hand cards before playing any more downcards.

A player who has no cards left drops out. The last player left with cards is the loser and deals in the next game, but players may agree other forfeits, such as getting the next round of drinks.

== Variations ==
The following variations are recorded:
* &quot;Jokers&quot;. Two Jokers are added as special cards that reverse the direction of play. They also allow six people to play.
* &quot;Additional special cards&quot;. Other card values can be given special attributes, such as reversing the order of play, skipping a player&#x27;s turn, or requiring the next card to be lower than the played card. A common one is to have one rank e.g. 8s considered &quot;transparent&quot;, &quot;invisible&quot; or &quot;glass&quot;, the next card played having to beat the one below the transparent card.
* &quot;Stacking&quot;. When rearranging cards before play begins, players may stack cards of the same rank on top of each other on the upcard piles and replenish the hand from stock; this may be done more than once if more cards can be stacked.
* &quot;Tens restricted&quot;. Tens may not be played on face cards; a player who plays a 10 may take another turn immediately.
* &quot;Lower than&quot;. When a 7 is played, the next play must be lower than 7, except that a 10 may still be played.
* &quot;Transparency&quot;. In some variants 8s (or 7s) are &quot;transparent&quot; and players instead play based on the card below them.

<text>Appliqué is ornamental needlework in which pieces or patches of fabric in different shapes and patterns are sewn or stuck onto a larger piece to form a picture or pattern. It is commonly used as decoration, especially on garments. The technique is accomplished either by hand stitching or machine. Appliqué is commonly practised with textiles, but the term may be applied to similar techniques used on different materials. In the context of ceramics, for example, an appliqué is a separate piece of clay added to the primary work, generally for the purpose of decoration.

The term originates from the Latin &quot;applicō&quot; &quot;I apply&quot; and subsequently from the French &quot;appliquer&quot; &quot;attach&quot;.
==History==

The term appliqué is derived from French and Latin verbs &quot;appliquer&quot; and &quot;applicare&quot;, respectively, which both mean to join or attach. Like embroidery, it has a humble beginning. The technique was used as a way to strengthen worn areas of items or to patch holes that had formed. Early appliqué was used to lengthen the life of clothing and moved into artful techniques that can be seen in blankets and quilts from numerous cultures from all over the world.

Archaeologists have discovered ancient examples of appliquéd leather in Egypt (980 BCE), and leather and felt appliqés have been found on carpets, wall hangings and saddle covers in 4th century BCE tombs in Siberia and Mongolia.
Appliquéd cloth is an important art form in Benin, West Africa, particularly in the area around Abomey, where it has been a tradition since the 18th century and the kingdom of Danhomè.
There are folk traditions to embellish garments with leather appliqué in Scandinavia, Russia and Eastern Europe, and leather appliqué is also found in Gujarat, India, Pakistan and Morocco where men&#x27;s clothing and leather slippers are decorated with embroidery and leather appliqué. Felt appliqué is used to add embellishments to women&#x27;s aprons in Eastern Europe and decorative uses of felt appliqué are also seen among the nomadic tribes of Central Asia to decorate yurts, floor covering and bags.
Reverse applique is used on the Mola textiles of South America.

==Types==
In the context of sewing, an appliqué refers to a needlework technique in which patterns or representational scenes are created by the attachment of smaller pieces of fabric to a larger piece of contrasting colour or texture. Good textiles for appliqué are durable and don&#x27;t easily fray, like felt and leather.

Applied pieces usually have their edges folded under, and are then attached by any of the following:
*Straight stitch, typically 20–30mm in from the edge.
*Satin stitch, all around, overlapping the edge. The patch may be glued or straight stitched on first to ensure positional stability and a neat edge.
*Reverse appliqué: the attached materials are sewn together, then cut away where another material covers it on top, before being sewn down onto the edges of the original material.

===Quilting===
Appliqué is used extensively in quilting. &quot;Dresden Plate&quot; and &quot;Sunbonnet Sue&quot; are two examples of traditional American quilt blocks that are constructed with both patchwork and appliqué. Baltimore album quilts, Broderie perse, Hawaiian quilts, Amish quilts, Egyptian Khayamiya and the ralli quilts of India and Pakistan also use appliqué.

===Banner making===
It is particularly suitable for work which is to be seen from a distance, such as in banner-making. A famous example of appliqué is the Hastings Embroidery.

===Seams on couture garments===
A lace-on-lace applique seam can be used to join edges of lace. Motifs in the design of the lace are overlapped and fastened down with a whipstitch. 

==Electronic sewing machines==
Modern consumer embroidery machines quickly stitch appliqué designs by following a program. The programs have a machine stops during stitching to allow the user to switch threads. First, the fabric that will be the background and the appliqué fabric are affixed into the machine&#x27;s embroidery hoop. The program is run and the machine makes a loose basting stitch over both layers of fabric. Next, the machine halts for a thread change, or other pre-programmed break. The user then cuts away the excess appliqué fabric from around the basting stitch. Following this, the machine continues on programme, automatically sewing the satin stitches and any decorative stitching over the appliqué for best results.

==See also==
* Collage, a technique of art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.
* Khatwa, the name given to appliqué works in Bihar, India.
* Godadi are the applique style embroidered blankets made by patching various pieces of cloth, in the Kutch district of Gujarat, India
* Appliqué armour, in military use, consists of extra protective plates mounted onto the hull or turret of an armoured fighting vehicle.

<doc id="89970" wikidata="Q970160" url="?curid=89970" title="Mars trilogy">
<text>The &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy is a series of science fiction novels by Kim Stanley Robinson that chronicles the settlement and terraforming of the planet Mars through the personal and detailed viewpoints of a wide variety of characters spanning 187 years, from 2026 to 2212. Ultimately more utopian than dystopian, the story focuses on egalitarian, sociological, and scientific advances made on Mars, while Earth suffers from overpopulation and ecological disaster.

The three novels are Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993), and Blue Mars (1996). The Martians (1999) is a collection of short stories set in the same fictional universe. &quot;Red Mars&quot; won the BSFA Award in 1992 and Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1993. &quot;Green Mars&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Novel and Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1994. &quot;Blue Mars&quot; also won the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1997.

&quot;Icehenge&quot; (1984), Robinson&#x27;s first novel about Mars, is not set in this universe but deals with similar themes and plot elements. The trilogy shares some similarities with Robinson&#x27;s more recent novel &quot;2312&quot; (2012); for instance, the terraforming of Mars and the extreme longevity of the characters in both novels.
==Plot==

=== &quot;Red Mars&quot; – Colonization ===

&quot;Red Mars&quot; starts in 2026 with the first colonial voyage to Mars aboard the &quot;Ares&quot;, the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever built and home to a crew who are to be the first hundred Martian colonists. The ship was built from clustered space shuttle external fuel tanks which, instead of reentering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, had been boosted into orbit until enough had been amassed to build the ship. The mission is a joint American–Russian undertaking, and seventy of the First Hundred are drawn from these countries (except, for example, Michel Duval, a French psychologist assigned to observe their behavior). The book details the trip out, construction of the first settlement on Mars (eventually called Underhill) by Russian engineer Nadia Cherneshevsky, as well as establishing colonies on Mars&#x27; hollowed out asteroid-moon Phobos, the ever-changing relationships between the colonists, debates among the colonists regarding both the terraforming of the planet and its future relationship to Earth. The two extreme views on terraforming are personified by Saxifrage &quot;Sax&quot; Russell, who believes their very presence on the planet means some level of terraforming has already begun and that it is humanity&#x27;s obligation to spread life as it is the most scarce thing in the known universe, and Ann Clayborne, who stakes out the position that humankind does not have the right to change entire planets at their will.

Russell&#x27;s view is initially purely scientific but in time comes to blend with the views of Hiroko Ai, the chief of the Agricultural Team who assembles a new belief system (the &quot;Areophany&quot;) devoted to the appreciation and furthering of life (&quot;viriditas&quot;); these views are collectively known as the &quot;Green&quot; position, while Clayborne&#x27;s naturalist stance comes to be known as &quot;Red.&quot; The actual decision is left to the United Nations Organization of Mars Affairs (UNOMA), which greenlights terraforming, and a series of actions get underway, including the drilling of &quot;moholes&quot; to release subsurface heat; thickening of the atmosphere according to a complicated bio-chemical formula that comes to be known as the &quot;Russell cocktail&quot; after Sax Russell; and the detonation of nuclear explosions deep in the sub-surface permafrost to release water. Additional steps are taken to connect Mars more closely with Earth, including the insertion of an areosynchronous asteroid &quot;Clarke&quot; to which a space elevator cable is tethered.

Against the backdrop of this development is another debate, one whose principal instigator is Arkady Bogdanov of the Russian contingent (possibly named in homage to the Russian polymath and science fiction writer Alexander Bogdanov - it is later revealed in Blue Mars that Alexander Bogdanov is an ancestor of Arkady&#x27;s.). Bogdanov argues that Mars need not and should not be subject to Earth traditions, limitations, or authority. He is to some extent joined in this position by John Boone, famous as the &quot;First Man on Mars&quot; from a preceding expedition and rival to Frank Chalmers, the technical leader of the American contingent. Their rivalry is further exacerbated by competing romantic interest in Maya Katarina Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent. (In the opening of the book, Chalmers instigates a sequence of events that leads to Boone being assassinated; much of what follows is a retrospective examination of what led to that point.)

Earth meanwhile increasingly falls under the control of transnational corporations (transnats) that come to dominate its governments, particularly smaller nations adopted as &quot;flags of convenience&quot; for extending their influence into Martian affairs. As UNOMA&#x27;s power erodes, the Mars treaty is renegotiated in a move led by Frank Chalmers; the outcome is impressive but proves short-lived as the transnats find ways around it through loop-holes. Things get worse as the nations of Earth start to clash over limited resources, expanding debt, and population growth as well as restrictions on access to a new longevity treatment developed by Martian scientists—one that holds the promise of lifespans into the hundreds of years. In 2061, with Boone dead and exploding immigration threatening the fabric of Martian society, Bogdanov launches a revolution against what many now view as occupying transnat troops operating only loosely under an UNOMA rubber-stamp approval. Initially successful, the revolution proves infeasible on the basis of both a greater-than-expected willingness of the Earth troops to use violence and the extreme vulnerability of life on a planet without a habitable atmosphere. A series of exchanges sees the cutting of the space elevator, bombardment of several Martian cities (including the city where Bogdanov is himself organizing the rebellion; he is killed), the destruction of Phobos and its military complex, and the unleashing of a great flood of torrential groundwater freed by nuclear detonations.

By the end, most of the First Hundred are dead, and virtually all who remain have fled to a hidden refuge established years earlier by Ai and her followers. (One exception is Phyllis Boyle, who has allied herself with the transnats; she is on Clarke when the space elevator cable is cut and sent flying out of orbit to a fate unknown by the conclusion of the book.) The revolution dies and life on Mars returns to a sense of stability under heavy transnat control. The clash over resources on Earth breaks out into a full-blown world war leaving hundreds of millions dead, but cease-fire arrangements are reached when the transnats flee to the safety of the developed nations, which use their huge militaries to restore order, forming police-states. But a new generation of humans born on Mars holds the promise of change. In the meantime, the remaining First Hundred —including Russell, Clayborne, Toitovna, and Cherneshevsky— settle into life in Hiroko Ai&#x27;s refuge called Zygote, hidden under the Martian south pole.

=== &quot;Green Mars&quot; – Terraforming ===

&quot;Green Mars&quot; takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed plants to grow. It picks up the story 50 years after the events of &quot;Red Mars&quot; in the dawn of the 22nd century, following the lives of the remaining First Hundred and their children and grandchildren. Melting ice causes the top of the dome of Hiroko Ai&#x27;s base under the south pole to collapse, forcing the survivors to escape into a (less literal) underground organization known as the Demimonde. Among the expanded group are the First Hundred&#x27;s children, the Nisei, a number of whom live in Hiroko&#x27;s second secret base, Gamete.

As unrest in the multinational control over Mars&#x27;s affairs grows, various groups start to form with different aims and methods. Watching these groups evolve from Earth, the CEO of the Praxis Corporation sends a representative, Arthur Randolph, to organize the resistance movements. This culminates into the Dorsa Brevia agreement, in which nearly all the underground factions take part. Preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s, from converting moholes to missiles silos or hidden bases, sabotaging orbital mirrors, to propelling Deimos out of Mars&#x27; gravity well and out into deep space so it could never be used as a weapons platform as Phobos was.

The book follows the characters across the Martian landscape, which is explained in detail. Russell&#x27;s character infiltrates the transnat terraforming project, with a carefully crafted fake identity as Stephen Lindholm. The newly evolving Martian biosphere is described at great length and with more profound changes mostly aimed at warming up the surface of Mars to the brink of making it habitable, from continent-sized orbital mirrors, another space elevator built (using another anchored asteroid that is dubbed &quot;New Clarke&quot;), to melting the northern polar ice cap, and digging moholes deep enough to form volcanoes. A mainstay of the novel is a detailed analysis of philosophical, political, personal, economic, and geological experiences of the characters. The story weaves back and forth from character to character, providing a picture of Mars as seen by them.

Sax, alias Stephen, eventually becomes romantically involved with Phyllis, who had survived the events of 2061 from the end of the first novel, but she discovers his true identity and has him arrested. Members of the underground launch a daring rescue from the prison facility where Sax suffers torture and interrogation that causes him to have a stroke; Maya kills Phyllis in the process of the rescue.

The book ends on a major event which is a sudden catastrophic rise in Earth&#x27;s global sea levels not caused primarily by any greenhouse effect but by the eruption of a chain of volcanoes underneath the ice of West Antarctica, disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean. The resultant flooding causes global chaos on Earth, creating the perfect moment for the Martian underground to seize control of Martian society from Earth. Following a series of largely bloodless coups, an extremist faction of Reds bombs a dam near Burroughs, the major city where the remaining United Nations forces have concentrated, in order to force the security forces to evacuate. The entire city is flooded and the population of the city has to walk a staggeringly long distance in the open Martian atmosphere (which just barely has the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and gas mixture to support human life) to Libya Station, in order to resettle in other locations. With this, control of Mars is finally wrested away from Earth with minimal loss of life, leaving the weary survivors hopeful about the prospects of their newfound political autonomy.

=== &quot;Blue Mars&quot; – Long-term results ===

&quot;Blue Mars&quot; takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed atmospheric pressure and temperature to increase so that liquid water can exist on the planet&#x27;s surface, forming rivers and seas. It follows closely in time from the end of &quot;Green Mars&quot; and has a much wider scope than the previous two books, covering an entire century after the second revolution. As Earth is heavily flooded by the sudden melting of the Antarctic ice cap, the once mighty metanats are brought to their knees; as the Praxis Corporation paves a new way of &quot;democratic businesses&quot;. Mars becomes the &quot;Head&quot; of the system, giving universal healthcare, free education, and an abundance of food. However, this sparks illegal immigration from Earth, so to ease the population strain on the Blue Planet, Martian scientists and engineers are soon put to the task of creating asteroid cities; where small planetoids of the Belt are hollowed out, given a spin to produce gravity, and a mini-sun is created to produce light and heat.

With a vast increase in sciences, technologies, and spacecraft manufacturing, this begins the &quot;Accelerando&quot;; where humankind spreads its civilization throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond. As Venus, the Jovian moons, the Saturnian moons, and eventually Triton are colonized and terraformed in some way, Jackie Boone (the granddaughter of John Boone, the first man to walk on Mars from the first book) takes an interstellar vessel (made out of an asteroid) to another star system twenty light-years away, where they will start to terraform the planets and moons found there.

The remaining First Hundred are generally regarded as living legends. Reports of Hiroko&#x27;s survival are numerous, and purported sightings occur all over the colonized solar system, but none are substantiated. Nadia and Art Randolph lead a constitutional congress in which a global system of government is established that leaves most cities and settlements generally autonomous, but subject to a central representative legislature and two systems of courts, one legal and the other environmental. The environmental court is packed with members of the Red faction as a concession (in exchange for their support in the congress, as much of their power was broken when they attempted and failed to violently expel remaining UN forces early on after the second revolution of Green Mars; yet they still retained enough power to stymie constitutional negotiations). Vlad, Marina, and Ursula, the original inventors of the longevity treatments, introduce a new economic system that is a hybrid of capitalism, socialism, and environmental conservationism. During a trip to Earth occurring alongside the congress, Nirgal (one of the original children to be born on Mars to the First Hundred, and something of a Mars-wide celebrity), Maya, and Sax negotiate an agreement that allows Earth to send a number of migrants equal to 10% of Mars&#x27; population to Mars every year. Following the adoption of the new constitution, Nadia is elected the first president of Mars and serves competently, although she does not enjoy politics. She and Art work together closely, and eventually fall in love and have a child.

Sax Russell devotes himself to various scientific projects, all the while continuing to recover from the effects of his stroke. Since the second revolution, he feels enormous guilt that his pro-terraforming position became the dominant one at the expense of the goals of Ann&#x27;s anti-terraforming stance, as Sax and Ann have come to be regarded as the original champions of their respective positions. Sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from Ann, while Ann, depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses, is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments. However, when Sax witnesses Ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world, he arranges for her to be resuscitated and to be treated with the longevity treatment, both against her will.

The longevity treatments themselves begin to show weaknesses once those receiving them reach the two-century mark in age. The treatments reduce most aging processes to a negligible rate, but are much less effective when it comes to brain function, and in particular memory. Maya in particular suffers extreme lapses in memory, although she remains high functioning most of the time. Further, as people age, they begin to show susceptibility to strange, fatal conditions which have no apparent explanation and are resistant to any treatment. Most common is the event that comes to be known as the &quot;quick decline&quot;, where a person of extremely advanced age and in apparently good health suffers a sudden fatal heart arrhythmia and dies abruptly. The exact mechanism is never explained. Michel dies of the quick decline, while attending the wake of another First Hundred member. Russell speculates that Michel&#x27;s quick decline was brought on by the shock of seeing Maya fail to remember Frank Chalmers (who was killed while escaping security forces in the first revolution) upon looking at a treasured photo of him on her refrigerator. As a result of this and Russell&#x27;s own problems with memory, he organizes a team of scientists to develop medicine that will restore memory. The remaining members of the First Hundred, of which there are only 12, congregate in Underhill, and take the medicine. It works so well that Russell remembers his own birth. He and Ann Clayborne finally recall that they had been in love prior to leaving Earth the very first time, but both had been too socially inept and nervous about their chances for selection for the Mars voyage to reveal this to each other. Their famous argument over terraforming had been a mere continuation of a running conversation they had been having since they still lived on Earth. Through the memory treatment it is also revealed that Phyllis had been lobbying to free Sax from his torturers when she was murdered by Maya. Maya herself declines the treatment. Sax also distinctly recalls Hiroko assisting him in finding his rover in a storm before he nearly froze to death before disappearing once again and is convinced she remains alive, although the question of whether she is actually alive is never resolved.

Eventually, the anti-immigration factions of the Martian government provoke massive illegal immigration from Earth, risking another war; however, under the leadership of Ann and Sax, who have fallen in love again following their reconciliation, along with Maya, the Martian population unites to reconstitute the government to accept more immigration from Earth, defusing the imminent conflict and ushering in a new golden age of harmony and security on Mars.

=== &quot;The Martians&quot; – Short stories ===

&quot;The Martians&quot; is a collection of short stories that takes place over the timespan of the original trilogy of novels, as well as some stories that take place in an alternate version of the novels where the First Hundred&#x27;s mission was one of exploration rather than colonization. Buried in the stories are several hints about the eventual fate of the Martian terraforming program.

== Story elements ==

=== Corporations ===
Trans-national Corporations, nicknamed &quot;transnats&quot;, are extremely powerful multinational corporations that first emerge in the mid-21st century. Robinson tracks the evolution of the transnats into what he terms &quot;metanats&quot; (metanational). These multinational corporations have grown so large as a result of globalization that they have sufficient economic power to take over or strongly manipulate national governments, initially only relatively small third-world governments, but later, larger developed governments too, effectively running whole countries. In Robinson&#x27;s future history, the metanational corporations become similar to nation-states in some respects, while continually attempting to take over competitors in order to become the sole controller of the market. As the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy draws to a close in the mid-23rd century, the metanational corporations are forced by a global catastrophe to concede more democratic powers to their workforces.

Although there are many transnational and metanational corporations mentioned, two play an active role in the development of the plotline: Praxis, a largely benevolent and relatively democratic firm, and Subarashī, which plays a large role in the maltreatment of the citizens of Mars.

=== Genetic engineering ===
Genetic engineering (GE) is first mentioned in &quot;Red Mars&quot;; it takes off when Sax creates an alga to withstand the harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In &quot;Green Mars&quot;, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By &quot;Blue Mars&quot;, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets.

=== Other themes ===
The books also speculate on the colonization of other planets and moons in the Solar System, and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on Callisto, Mercury, Titania, Miranda and Venus. Toward the end of the last novel, humans are taking sub-light colony ships to other stars, taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive the trip to their destinations.

A great portion of &quot;Blue Mars&quot; is concerned with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists, most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated longevity treatments. In particular, Robinson speculates on the psychological effects of ultra-longevity, including memory loss, personality change, mental instability, and existential boredom.

==Characters==
===The First Hundred===
The initial colonists from the &quot;Ares&quot; who established a permanent colony. Many of them later become leaders or exemplary figures in the transformation of Mars or its new society. The &quot;First Hundred&quot; actually consisted of 101, with Coyote being smuggled aboard the &quot;Ares&quot; by Hiroko.

====John Boone====
An American astronaut, who was the first human to walk on Mars in the year 2020. He returns a public hero and uses his considerable influence to lobby for a second mission, this time one of colonization. Boone received a large amount of radiation on his first trip to Mars, more than the recommended dosage according to medical regulations. However, his celebrity status allows him to skirt this. On the second voyage, Boone is one of the &quot;First Hundred&quot; colonists sent to permanently colonize Mars. His accomplishments and natural charm yield him an informal leadership role. In the first chapter of &quot;Red Mars&quot;, John Boone is assassinated in a plot instigated by Frank Chalmers. The narrative then steps back to the First Hundred&#x27;s voyage to Mars aboard the spaceship &quot;Ares&quot;. His ideas continue as a point of reference for the remainder of the trilogy. Boone&#x27;s character portrayal is complex; in one light, Boone is a stereotypically simple, heroic figure, an everyman hero: his first words on his first trip to Mars are &quot;Well, here we are.&quot; He is almost uniformly cheerful and good-natured, and approaches everything he undertakes with hale bonhomie. But later in &quot;Red Mars&quot;, Robinson switches to Boone&#x27;s point of view, and it is in this section that it is revealed that late in life, Boone is addicted to omegendorph, a fictional drug that is based on endorphins in the human brain. In addition, it reveals that at least some of his seeming simplicity might simply be an act designed to further his political goals. Overall, Boone is presented as larger-than-life.

====Frank Chalmers====
Head of the American contingent, he is in his use of power. However, his cynicism is later shown to be a form of self-defense; Chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side. Early in the voyage to Mars, he becomes sexually involved with Maya Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent of the mission. During the second half of the voyage, Toitovna becomes involved with Boone. Already bitter that Boone became the first to walk on Mars instead of him as they were both candidates for the mission and that he was allowed to join the colonization trip despite his manipulations, Chalmers further despises Boone because of Toitovna&#x27;s affection. His dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate Boone, which ultimately succeeds and allows him to take over handling major affairs on Mars. This ultimately becomes his undoing, as his ruthless governance and aggressive diplomatic work backfire on him during the revolution of 2061. In the final chapters of &quot;Red Mars&quot;, Chalmers flees with Toitovna and other members of the First Hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap but dies along the way when he is caught outside their vehicle during an aquifer flood in Valles Marineris.

====Maya Toitovna====
An emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers, she begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the Russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution, she flees with other members of the First Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from bipolar disorder and from memory-related psychological disorders with growing age, which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent. Throughout the novels, Maya takes an active political role, helping to keep the surviving First Hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later, despite her psychological problems.

====Nadezhda &quot;Nadia&quot; Chernyshevski====
A Russian engineer who started out building nuclear reactors in Siberia, during the voyage and initial exploration of Mars, she does her best to avoid the squabbles of the other members of the First Hundred. Instead, she busies herself by building the first permanent habitation of Mars, Underhill, using programmed automated robots. She also helps to construct a new and larger habitat, and research facility in a nearby canyon. In the later books, she becomes a reluctant politician. Chernyshevski is in love with Bogdanov and is devastated when he is killed in an attack by anti-revolutionary forces associated with UNOMA, the transnationals and Phyllis Boyle during the first Martian revolution. In retaliation for Bogdanov&#x27;s murder, she activates his hidden weapon system, built into Phobos, which causes the entire moon (a UNOMA/transnational military base) to decelerate in orbit and destructively aerobrake in Mars&#x27; atmosphere, utterly destroying it. In &quot;Blue Mars&quot;, she falls in love with Art Randolph, with whom she eventually starts a family. After Martian independence, she grudgingly becomes the first president of Mars.

====Arkady Bogdanov====
A mechanical engineer with anarchist leanings, possibly based on the Russian Machist, Alexander Bogdanov (the character&#x27;s ancestor) and Arkady Strugatsky, he is regarded by many other members of the First Hundred, particularly Boyle, as a troublemaker. He leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon Phobos, and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first novel. Like Boone (with whom he was good friends), his political ideas (later known as Bogdanovism) weigh heavily on characters later in the series. In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first Martian revolution in 2061.

====Saxifrage &quot;Sax&quot; Russell====
An American physicist, he is a brilliant and creative scientist, and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts. However, he is socially awkward and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people. Russell is a leader of the Green movement, the goal of which is to terraform Mars. During &quot;Green Mars&quot;, Sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces and fellow member of the First Hundred, Phyllis Boyle (although it is later revealed that she actually opposed Sax&#x27;s torture). He subsequently suffers from expressive aphasia and has to relearn how to speak and becomes less predictable in his actions. Originally apolitical, this event and a growing attachment to Mars itself leads Russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution. After memory issues become apparent in many of the remaining first hundred including Sax he begins work on an ambitious project to gather the remaining first hundred and have them try an experimental treatment he helped to develop. It is after this that Sax realizes his persistent attempts to please Ann are actually because he is also secretly in love with Ann Clayborne, who cannot stand him at first, but after decades on Mars, eventually reconciles. Saxifrage means &quot;stonebreaker&quot; and is the name for an Alpine plant that grows between stones.

====Ann Clayborne====
An American geologist, Clayborne is one of the first areologists and maintains a stalwart desire to see Mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive. Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original &quot;Red,&quot; while Russell&#x27;s hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views. Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases. Simon&#x27;s death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate &quot;green&quot; drive her to further isolation. Clayborne&#x27;s relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control. During the events of &quot;Blue Mars&quot;, Russell intervenes to save Clayborne&#x27;s life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change toward Blue Mars due to the emergence of something inside of her that she describes as anti-Ann and something else that she can&#x27;t quite describe.

====Hiroko Ai ()====
A Japanese expert on biology, agriculture, and ecological systems, it was Ai who smuggled Desmond &quot;Coyote&quot; Hawkins onto the &quot;Ares&quot; (the two were friends and lovers as students in London). She is the charismatic leader of the farm team, one of the important work groups and cliques among the First Hundred. She thus becomes the focus of many of the trilogy&#x27;s central themes. Most importantly, she teaches the importance of maintaining a respectful relation with one&#x27;s planet. On Mars, this is called the Areophany. In the secret colony Zygote, which Hiroko established, the first generation of children of the First Hundred, the ectogenes, are all the product of artificial insemination outside of any human body. Hiroko uses the ova of the female members of the First Hundred as the female genetic material and uses the sperm of the male members of the First Hundred to fertilize the ova. Although Hiroko is seldom at the center of the narrative, her influence is pervasive. She disappears for the final time in &quot;Green Mars&quot;. Her ultimate fate is left unresolved. &quot;Ai&quot; (愛) is the Japanese word for love.

====Michel Duval====
A French psychologist pivotally involved in the early psychological screening of the First Hundred candidates in Antarctica, which he describes as being a collection of double-bind requirements. Duval is assigned to accompany the Mars mission and is treated as an observer rather than as a member of the team during the early events of &quot;Red Mars&quot;. His aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others, but in time it becomes clear that Duval is struggling with his own psychological issues perhaps more than anyone else from the expedition. During the first disappearance of the farm team, he is invited by Hiroko to flee with the farm team and establish Zygote, the first hidden colony. Duval desperately wants to return to Provence as he remembers it, and after visiting as a part of the Martian diplomatic mission to Earth, he becomes even more homesick. Duval falls in love with Maya Toitovna and guides her through particularly challenging psychological episodes throughout most of the series, dying late in &quot;Blue Mars&quot; of heart arrhythmia when Maya displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss.

====Vladimir &quot;Vlad&quot; Taneev====
Nearly sixty when he arrives on Mars, a Russian biological scientist who is the oldest of the First Hundred. Taneev heads medical treatment and most research projects on Mars, becoming famous as the creator of the gerontological treatment used to regenerate human cellular systems and ushering in a new era of longevity. He lives in Acheron on the Great Escarpment in the north of Mars before fleeing to the hidden colony after the First Revolution but later returns to his research, falling victim to &quot;quick decline&quot; late in the events of &quot;Blue Mars&quot;. For much of his Mars-centric life, Taneev lives in a ménage à trois with Ursula and Marina, the exact nature of which is never resolved.
====Phyllis Boyle====
A Christian American geologist with a harsh personality that does not win her many friends among the First Hundred and gains particular enmity from Ann Clayborne. As the Mars situation develops, Boyle sides against most of the First Hundred in favor of the increasingly authoritarian United Nations Office of Mars Affairs (UNOMA) and its successor, the corporate/quasi-fascist United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTA). Her influence is strongest during the later events of &quot;Red Mars&quot;, where by the 2061 revolution she has been placed in charge of the asteroid Clarke that serves as the counterweight of the First Space Elevator. The events of the revolution send Clarke (and Boyle) spinning off into the outer Solar System at the end of &quot;Red Mars&quot;; &quot;Green Mars&quot; finds her back in the equation, but her influence is greatly reduced against the backdrop of a much-expanded UNTA presence. Boyle engages in a brief sexual relationship with Saxifrage Russell (who despises her) while the latter is living under an assumed identity and is singularly capable of discerning who he really is, turning him over the UNTA. She is later present at a session in Kasei Vallis where Russell is being tortured, and is killed by Maya Toitovna. Later, as his memory recovers, Russell reveals that Boyle had been opposed to his torture and was demanding that he be released at the time that Maya&#x27;s team freed him.

====Desmond &quot;Coyote&quot; Hawkins====
A Trinidadian stowaway, he is a friend and supporter of Hiroko, and a fervent anarchist communist. Present in &quot;Red Mars&quot; only as a stowaway who eventually blends effortlessly into the Martian background, he is not even identified as anything more than Coyote until the beginning of &quot;Green Mars&quot;. He becomes a leading figure in the underground and an unofficial coordinator of a developing gift economy.

===Their descendants===
Since the trilogy covers over 200 years of human history, later immigrants and the children and grandchildren of the First Hundred eventually become important characters in their own right.

The Martians use the same terminology for different generations as Japanese Americans. People who immigrated from Earth are called issei, the first generation born on Mars are nisei, and the second-generation Martians are sansei. Third-generation Martians are called yonsei.

====Kasei====
Kasei is the son of Hiroko and John Boone and the father of Jackie Boone. Kasei is the leader of the Kakaze, a radical Red faction. His name is Japanese for the planet Mars. He dies during the second revolution, after an unsuccessful attack on the second space elevator.

====Nirgal====
The son of Hiroko and Coyote, he is raised communally by Hiroko and her followers in Zygote. He is a good-natured wanderer who eventually becomes a political leader advocating ties with Earth. He is one of the founders of the Free Mars movement and is famous for his running technique that allows him to run all day for days on end. As Nadia&#x27;s assistants, he and Art are instrumental in getting the Martian constitutional declaration written. Later he is sent on a diplomatic mission to Earth but nearly dies from an infection. His name is ancient Babylonian for Mars (the planet and the war-god).

====Jackie Boone====
The granddaughter of Hiroko and John Boone (raised with Nirgal), she emerges as a leader of the Free Mars movement, but is seen to change her platform based on whatever keeps her in power (e.g. changing from banning Earth immigration to allowing almost unlimited immigrants). After her daughter Zo&#x27;s death, she retires in grief and joins a one-way expedition to an extrasolar planet near Aldebaran.

====Peter Clayborne====
Peter Clayborne is the son of Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier, being one of the first children born on Mars. Peter holds a position of older brother to all of the following first generation. Many revolutionary and later political decisions of the Mars First movement are influenced by his opinions and judgment. He works part-time as an engineer and a green politician.

====Zoya &quot;Zo&quot; Boone====
Jackie&#x27;s daughter; she has feline traits (purring) inserted into her genome via the gerontological longevity treatment. In &quot;Blue Mars&quot;, she travels the solar system running political errands for Jackie, although the two do not get along particularly well. Her character is portrayed as hedonistic and explicitly nihilistic, making sexual satisfaction a priority and seemingly having little regard for the feelings of others. On the other hand, she apparently has a conscience, risking her life to rescue a man on Mercury and later dying in an attempt to save a distressed flier.

====Nikki====
The daughter of Nadia and Art.

===Other characters===
====Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Randolph====
A representative of the Praxis corporation sent to contact the Martian underground movement on a quasi-diplomatic mission in an attempt to create a system of ecological capitalism based on democratic corporations. Like the other metanationals, it takes on intensive economic and political ties with governments, but Praxis aims for partnerships rather than exploitive relationships.

====Zeyk Tuqan () and his wife Nazik ()====
Bedouin nomads who originally emigrated from Egypt and respected figures in the Arab Martian community. Zeyk is a close friend of Chalmers. His eidetic memory becomes a minor plot point.

====William Fort====
The founder of Praxis, one of the huge multinational corporations. He embraces a fusion of Eastern and Western lifestyles.

==Development history==
In an interview at UCSD, Robinson said that he was looking at a satellite photo of Mars and thought that would be a great place to go backpacking. He said the Mars trilogy grew out of that urge.

==Awards==

==Adaptations and uses==

===Screen adaptations===
The series has had difficulty moving into film and TV for over two decades. The Mars trilogy screen production rights were held by James Cameron in the late 1990s, who conceived a five-hour miniseries to be directed by Martha Coolidge, but he subsequently passed on the option. Later, Gale Ann Hurd planned a similar mini-series for the Sci-Fi Channel, which also remained unproduced. Then, in October 2008, it was reported that AMC and Jonathan Hensleigh had teamed up and were planning to develop a television mini-series based on &quot;Red Mars&quot;.

In September 2014, SpikeTV announced it was working with producer Vince Gerardis to develop a TV series adaptation of &quot;Red Mars&quot; and in December 2015, formally greenlit a ten-episode first season of a TV series based on the novels, with J. Michael Straczynski serving as showrunner and writer. However, in March 2016, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Straczynski had left his position as showrunner with Peter Noah replacing him, but he too left due to creative differences with Spike. Spike then put the series on hold for further development.

===On Phoenix spacecraft===
The content of &quot;Green Mars&quot; and the cover artwork for &quot;Red Mars&quot; are included on the Phoenix DVD, carried on board &quot;Phoenix&quot;, a NASA lander that successfully touched down on Mars in May 2008. The First Interplanetary Library is intended to be a sort of time capsule for future Mars explorers and colonists.

==Translations in other languages==
The trilogy has been translated into Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Polish, Hebrew, Japanese, Italian, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Serbian, among others.
