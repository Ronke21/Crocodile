<text>Languedoc-Roussillon (; ; ) is a former administrative region of France. On 1 January 2016, it joined with the region of Midi-Pyrénées to become Occitania. It comprised five departments, and bordered the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées towards the north, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea towards the south. It was the southernmost region of mainland France.

==Toponymy==
The first part of the name of the province of Languedoc-Roussillon comes from the French (&quot;language of &quot;), and is also a historical region. In southern France, the word for &quot;yes&quot; was the Occitan language word . Prior to the 16th century, the central area of France was referred to as , there the word for &quot;yes&quot; was in Old French, later becoming . These old place names referred to the areas where Occitan and Old French were spoken. The Edict of Villers-Cotterets made French the official national language in 1539. Roussillon was the name of the medieval County of Roussillon.

== History ==
Towards the end of the 3rd century BC, a Celtic people, the , took up residence in the region between the Rhône and the Garonne, from the Cévennes to the Pyrenees. Their capitals were Toulouse and Nîmes.

They made a pact with the Romans from the 1st century BC. Narbonne was created to pacify the province in 118 BC and became the capital of the Narbonnaise.

At the beginning of the 5th century, the Vandals invaded the province and then the Visigoths settled there. The Narbonne region, like the Iberian Peninsula, remained Visigothic until its conquest by the Moors between 719 () and 725 (fall of Carcassonne and Nîmes). Narbonne then became the capital of one of the five provinces of led by a for nearly forty years.

The region was conquered by Pépin the Short (fall of Narbonne in 759), who made it the marquisate of Gothia, included in the kingdom of Aquitaine created in 778. This vast territory encompassed all of the south of the Rhône to the Atlantic and was bequeathed by Charlemagne to his son Louis the Pious in 781. The administration was entrusted to the counts of Toulouse.

During the feudal era, a great political fragmentation took place: the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya passed into the orbit of the Crown of Aragon, while Bas-Languedoc passed under the domination of the house of Trencavel and their rivals the counts of Toulouse.

Raymond IV (1042–1115) achieved through marriage the objective of reunification by enlarging his state to the county of Rouergue, Nîmes, Narbonne, Gévaudan, Agde, Béziers and Uzès.

The fight against Catharism and the Albigensian Crusade led to the extinction of the dynasty of the Counts of Toulouse. The province was united to the Kingdom of France in 1271, with the exception of Montpellier, which remained under the influence of the House of Barcelona and then of Majorca, and which was not attached to the Kingdom of France until 1349. From there was born the royal Languedoc which persisted until the French Revolution.

The Treaty of Corbeil in 1258 ratified the division with the southern territories of the region. The Corbières formed the border between the Kingdom of France and the Principality of Catalonia in the Crown of Aragon.

In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees led to the annexation of Roussillon and northern Cerdanya to the Kingdom of France.

== Population ==
The region is experiencing the strongest demographic growth in France, and could have around 3,300,000 inhabitants by 2030, an increase of 36% compared to 2000. This increase is mainly due to internal migration, natural increase being rather low.

Pyrénées-Orientales has the largest proportion of elderly people (12.10% over 75). Gard and Hérault are the &quot;youngest&quot; departments, but they are destined to &quot;age&quot; considerably in the coming years. By 2020, the number of people aged over 75 is expected to increase by 12% across the region.

=== Religion ===
Catholicism is the most represented religion in the region, particularly at the level of historical monuments and associations. The Ecclesiastical Province of Montpellier () corresponds to the administrative region. The region has 16 cathedrals (Agde, Alès, Alet, Béziers, Carcassonne, Elne, Lodève, Maguelone, Mende, Montpellier, Narbonne, Nîmes, Perpignan, Saint-Papoul, Saint-Pons-de-Thomières, Uzès).

Protestantism is well represented in the region, especially in the Huguenot stronghold of the Cévennes. The &quot;Cévennes-Languedoc-Roussillon region&quot; of the United Protestant Church includes Gard, Lozère, Hérault, Aude, Pyrénées-Orientales as well as the eastern part of Aveyron. It is an important region by its Protestant population (approximately 20,000 homes), but one of the least extensive of the United Protestant Church of France. In addition to this majority church, the region has since the 19th century a variety of Free, Reformed Evangelical, Baptist, Methodist and Pentecostal churches.

Judaism has been present since the Middle Ages with significant communities fleeing the Almohads, in Narbonne and Béziers. The Jews are thus cited in the will of William V of Montpellier. Islam is also present at the same time.

Catharism appeared in the region in the middle of the 12th century, in Aude.

== Geography ==

The region is made up of the following historical provinces:

* 68.7% of Languedoc-Roussillon was formerly part the province of Languedoc: the departments of Hérault, Gard, Aude, the extreme south and extreme east of Lozère, and the extreme north of Pyrénées-Orientales. The former province of Languedoc also extends over what is now the Midi-Pyrénées region, including the old capital of Languedoc Toulouse.
* 17.9% of Languedoc-Roussillon was formerly the province of Gévaudan, now the department of Lozère. A small part of the former Gévaudan lies inside the current Auvergne region. Gévaudan is often considered to be a sub-province inside the province of Languedoc, in which case Languedoc would account for 86.6% of Languedoc-Roussillon.
* 13.4% of Languedoc-Roussillon, located in the southernmost part of the region, is a collection of five historical Catalan , from east to west: Roussillon, Vallespir, Conflent, Capcir, and Cerdagne, all of which are now part of the department of Pyrénées-Orientales. These pays were part of the Ancien Régime province of Roussillon, owning its name to the largest and most populous of the five pays, Roussillon. &quot;Province of Roussillon and adjacent lands of Cerdagne&quot; was indeed the name that was officially used after the area became French in 1659, based on the historical division of the five pays between the county of Roussillon (Roussillon and Vallespir) and the county of Cerdagne (Cerdagne, Capcir, and Conflent).

Llívia is a town of Cerdanya, province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain, that forms a Spanish exclave surrounded by French territory (department of Pyrénées-Orientales).

==Politics==

At the regional elections in March 2004, the socialist mayor of Montpellier Georges Frêche, defeated its center-right president. Since then, Georges Frêche has embarked on a complete overhaul of the region and its institutions. The flag of the region, which displayed the cross of Languedoc as well as the Flag of Roussillon (the ), was changed for a new flag with no reference to the old provinces, except in terms of the colors (red and yellow), which are the colors of both Languedoc and all the territories from the former Crown of Aragon.

Georges Frêche also wanted to change the name of the region, wishing to erase its duality (Languedoc vs. Roussillon) and strengthen its unity. Thus, he wanted to rename the region Septimanie (Septimania). was the name created by the Romans at the end of the Roman Empire for the coastal area corresponding quite well to present day Languedoc-Roussillon (including Roussillon, but not including Gévaudan), and used in the early Middle Ages for the area. This name, however, has not been in use since the 9th century, and it sounded quite odd to French people. Strong opposition of the population led to Georges Frêche giving up on his idea. He declared that he still believed in it but could not go ahead without a mandate.

Catalan nationalists in Roussillon would like the Pyrénées-Orientales department to secede from Languedoc-Roussillon and become a region in its own right, under the proposed name of (Northern Catalonia), as part of the (Catalan Countries), a new country. This idea has minimal popular support.

On the other hand, there are some who would like to merge the Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyrénées regions, thus reunifying the old province of Languedoc, and creating a large region. It seems probable that Georges Frêche, with his idea of a &quot;Septimanie&quot; region, would not support such plans, although political leaders in Béziers, Narbonne, and especially Nîmes, would probably support such a merger, hostile as they are to Montpellier, which was chosen as the capital of Languedoc-Roussillon instead of their own city, and which they accuse of hegemony.

==Culture==
===Language===
Prior to the 20th century, Occitan was the language spoken in Languedoc, and Catalan was the language spoken in Roussillon. Both have been under pressure from French. In 2004, research conducted by the Government of Catalonia showed that 65% of adults over the age of 15 in Roussillon could understand Catalan whereas 37% stated they were able to speak it.

In recent years there have been attempts at reviving of both languages, including Catalan-medium schooling through the La Bressola schools.

===Literature===
Occitan literature – still sometimes called Provençal literature – is a body of texts written in Occitan in what is nowadays the South of France. It originated in the poetry of the eleventh- and twelfth-century troubadours, and inspired the rise of vernacular literature throughout medieval Europe.

===Music===
Aimeric de Peguilhan, Giraut de Bornelh and Bertran de Born were major influences in troubadour composition, in the High Middle Ages. The troubadour tradition is considered to have originated in the region.

The Romantic music composer Déodat de Séverac was born in the region, and, following his schooling in Paris, returned to the region to compose. He sought to incorporate the music indigenous to the area in his compositions.

===Wine===

The Languedoc-Roussillon region is dominated by of vineyards, three times the combined area of the vineyards in Bordeaux and the region has been an important winemaking centre for several centuries. Grapevines are said to have existed in the South of France since the Pliocene period - before the existence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The first vineyards of Gaul developed around two towns: Béziers and Narbonne. The Mediterranean climate and plentiful land with soil ranging from rocky sand to thick clay was very suitable for the production of wine, and it is estimated that one in ten bottles of the world&#x27;s wine was produced in this region during the 20th century (Robinson 1999:395). Despite this enormous quantity, the area&#x27;s significance was often overlooked by scholarly publications and commercial journals, largely because very little of the wine being produced was classified under an appellation contrôlée until the 1980s (Joseph 2005:190).

Several entrepreneurs such as Robert Skalli and James Herrick drastically changed the face of the region, planting more commercially viable grape varieties and pushing for new AOC classifications. While the AOC system has origins in the 15th century, the Languedoc-Roussillon has some appellations like the Cabardès which have existed by law only since 1999 (Joseph 2005:190).

The region is the largest contributor to the European Union&#x27;s glut (dominance of supply over demand) of wine known as the wine lake.

The Languedoc-Roussillon region has adopted a marque to help market its products, in particular, but not limited to, wine. The (&quot;Southern France&quot;) marque was adopted in 2006 to help customers abroad not familiar with the Appellation system to recognise those wines that originated in the L-R area, but the marque is also used for other products, including cheeses, olive oils and pies.

===Sport===
Languedoc-Roussillon has been a major center of Rugby league in France since the sport was introduced to the country in the 1930s. The region is also home to the rugby union teams AS Béziers Hérault, RC Narbonne and USA Perpignan. Since the following years of the retirement of this region, the popularity has gone down.

Montpellier is home to Montpellier HSC, which was founded in 1974 and plays in the Ligue 1, the French top division. It won the French Championship after the 2011/12 season. Home matches are played at the Stade La Mosson, named after the area where it is located, with a capacity of 31,250. It was built in 1998.

<doc id="86575" wikidata="Q1821380" url="?curid=86575" title="Lugus">
<text>Lugus (sometimes Lugos or Lug) is a Celtic god whose worship is attested in the epigraphic record. No depictions of the god are known. Lugus perhaps also appears in Roman sources and medieval Insular mythology.

Various dedications, concentrated in Iberia and dated to between the 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE, attest to the worship of the god Lugus. However, these predominately describe the god in the plural, as the Lugoves. The nature of these deities, and their relationship to Lugus, has been much debated. Only one, early inscription from Peñalba de Villastar, Spain is widely agreed to attest to Lugus as a singular entity. The god Lugus has also been cited in the etymologies of several Celtic personal and place-names incorporating the element &quot;Lug(u)-&quot; (for example, the Roman settlement Lugdunum).

Julius Caesar&#x27;s description in his &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; of an important pre-Roman Gaulish god (whom Caesar identified with the Roman god Mercury) has been interpreted as a reference to the god Lugus. Caesar&#x27;s description of Gaulish Mercury has been examined against Insular sources, as well as the prominence of &quot;Lug(u)-&quot; elements in Gaulish place-names. A prominent cult to Mercury in Roman Gaul may provide more evidence for this identification.

Lugus has also been connected with two figures from medieval Insular mythology. In Irish mythology, Lugh is an important and supernatural figure. His description as a skilled artisan and founder of a harvest festival has been compared with Gaulish Mercury. In Welsh mythology, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, a protagonist of the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, is a more minor figure, but is linked etymologically with Irish Lugh. He perhaps shares with the Lugoves an association with shoemaking.

The reconstruction of a pan-Celtic god Lugus from these details, first proposed in the 19th century by Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville, has proven controversial. Criticism of this theory by scholars such as Bernhard Maier has caused aspects (such as a pan-Celtic festival of Lugus on 1 August) to be abandoned, however scholars still defend the reconstruction.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Lugus&#x27;s name has been the subject of repeated conjecture, but no single etymology has gained wide acceptance.

The most commonly repeated etymology derives the name from proto-Indo-European * (&quot;to shine&quot;). This etymology is closely tied to proposals to identify Lugus as a solar god. However, Garrett Olmsted has pointed out that this derivation poses phonological difficulties. Proto-Celtic cannot develop from proto-Indo-European , according to the known sound changes between the two languages. has noted that this root would result in Irish , rather than the attested Irish .

 and Erich Hamp have proposed that the name derives from a proto-Celtic word meaning &quot;oath&quot; (either or ). John T. Koch has taken this hypothesis up, and proposed that the early Irish oath &quot;tongu do dia toinges mo thúath&quot; is a suppressed oath to Lugus. A. G. van Hamel and Maier proposed a derivation from proto-Celtic (&quot;lynx&quot;), perhaps used allusively to mean &quot;warrior&quot;, but an article by John Carey found the evidence for the existence of such a word in proto-Celtic lacking. Other etymologies derive &quot;Lugus&quot; from the name of the Norse god Loki, proto-Celtic (&quot;mouse&quot; or &quot;rat&quot;), and Gaulish (&quot;raven&quot;).

==Linguistic evidence==
===Epigraphy===
A number of dedications to Lugus, dating between the 1st century BCE and 3rd century CE, have been found in Continental Europe. This epigraphic data is concentrated in Iberia; only a small number of inscriptions are known from Gaul, and none are known from Britain or Ireland. A peculiarity of this data is that the singular of Lugus&#x27;s name is rarely recorded. There is consensus that a Celtiberian inscription from Peñalba de Villastar features the singular. A minority interpret the Gaulish-language Chamalières tablet as invoking singular Lugus. The singular is inscribed on a ceramic sherd from , but this is probably a theophoric name and not a reference to the god Lugus. Many Celtic gods are referenced both in the plural and the singular, but in dedications to Lugus the plural form (&quot;Lugoves&quot; or &quot;Lucoves&quot;) predominates.

The nature of the Lugoves, and their relationship to Lugus, has been much debated. The epigraphic record is equivocal as to the gender of these deities. The epithet (attested at San Martín de Liñarán) has masculine gender, whereas the epithets (attested on an altar from Lugo) and possibly indicate the feminine. Henri Gaidoz contended that plural deities were minor in the Celtic pantheon, and that therefore Lugus could not have been the chief god of the Celts. Arbois de Jubainville and Joseph Vendryes argued that the Celts invoked even major gods (such as Mars) in the plural. Some scholars have tried to explain the multiplicity of the Lugoves through traits of Irish Lugh or Welsh Lleu. Marie-Louise Sjoestedt, for example, pointed out that Lugh was one of triplets. Maier has argued that the obscurity of the nature of the Lugoves limits the value of the epigraphic record as evidence for pan-Celtic Lugus. Krista Ovist argues against this point.

===Proper names===
The element &quot;lug(u)-&quot; appears frequently in Celtic proper names. In many of these cases, an etymology involving the deity-name Lugus has been proposed. Celtic personal names with this element include Lug, Lugaunus, Lugugenicus, Lugotorix, Luguadicos, Luguselva, and Lougous. A number of cognate names are known from Irish Ogham inscriptions, for example, Luga, Lugudecca (perhaps, &quot;serving the god Lugus&quot;), Luguqritt (perhaps, &quot;poet like Lugus&quot;), and Luguvvecca. Some ethnic names have been connected with Lugus, for example the Lugi in Scotland and the in Asturias. Place-names connected with Lugus include Lugii, Lougoi, Lougionon, Lugisonis, and Lugnesses. Lucus Augusti (modern-day Lugo) is the site of a Roman sanctuary with dedications to the Lugoves; its name may be derived from the deity-name Lugus, though it could simply be Latin for &quot;grove of Augustus&quot;. The name of Luguvalium (modern-day Carlisle) is sometimes glossed as &quot;wall of Lugus&quot;, but may instead derive from a personal name.

Since Arbois de Jubainville argued for the connection, the place-name &quot;Lugdunum&quot; has frequently been connected etymologically with Lugus. The most famous known by this name is Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon) in the region of Gallia Lugdunensis, a Roman colony and among the most important cities of Roman Gaul. The etymology of this place-name has been the subject of much conjecture. Following Arbois de Jubainville, the most widely held hypothesis analyses the name as + (&quot;fort&quot;), that is, &quot;the fortress of Lugus&quot;. Many other etymologies have been given. An ancient etymology derives it from a Gaulish word for raven. Attempts have been made to analyse it as (&quot;luminous&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;) + (&quot;hill&quot;), bolstered by a medieval etymology which gives the gloss (&quot;shining mountain&quot;).

The place-name Lugdunum is attested, in its cognate forms, as the name of as many as twenty-seven locations. Apart from Lyon, there is Lugdunum Convenarum (modern-day Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges), Lugdunum Batavorum (near Leyden), Lugdunum Remorum (modern-day Laon), two Welsh places named Din Lleu (the order of the elements reversed), and two cities of unclear location in North East England and Germania Magna. The wide range and abundance of these place-names has been used to argue for the importance of Lugus. Whatever the etymology, not all of these place-names must owe themselves a Celtic root. Lugdunum/Lyon was a major city, and other locations may have borrowed the name. Some two-thirds of the cognate place-names are attested only from the 10th century on; we know that Lugdunum Remorum had an older, native name (Bibrax) which was displaced in the 6th century.

==Caesar and Gaulish Mercury==

&quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot; is Julius Caesar&#x27;s first-hand account of the Gallic Wars (58 to 50 BCE). In giving an account of the customs of the Gauls, Caesar wrote the following:
Caesar here employs the device of &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;, in which foreign gods are equated with those of the Roman pantheon. With very few exceptions, Roman writings about Celtic and Germanic religion employ &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;, but the equations they made varied from writer to writer. This makes identifying the native gods behind the Roman names very difficult. Indeed, if their information was confused or their intention was propagandistic, reconstruction of native religion is next to impossible.

Caesar contrasts Gaulish Mercury with the other gods of the Gauls, insofar as he is the god about whom they do not have &quot;much the same ideas&quot; as the Romans. The Romans associated Mercury with trading and travel, but they did not think of him as &quot;inventor of all arts&quot;. Another difference is suggested by the order in which the gods are presented: Mercury is given primacy, whereas the Romans considered Jupiter the most important deity. Moreover, Mercury&#x27;s role as guide of souls to the underworld (an important aspect of the god for the Romans) goes unmentioned in this passage. Caesar elsewhere ascribes to the Gauls a belief in metempsychosis, which may have precluded Gaulish Mercury from this function.

The first Celtic god to be identified as Caesar&#x27;s Gaulish Mercury was Teutates. This identification was widely accepted until the late 19th century, when Arbois de Jubainville proposed that Lugus lay behind Caesar&#x27;s description. Arbois de Jubainville pointed to the prominence of &quot;Lug(u)-&quot; elements in Gaulish place-names, and a possible festival of Lugus at Lugdunum/Lyon (discussed below). He also drew comparison between Irish Lugh&#x27;s epithet (&quot;master of all arts&quot;) and Caesar&#x27;s description of Gaulish Mercury as &quot;inventor of all arts&quot;. Maier has criticised this identification on the basis that &quot;inventor of all arts&quot;, though not a Greco-Roman belief about the god Mercury, is a common literary topos in Roman descriptions of foreign religions. He also casts doubt on the possibility that an epithet like this, not otherwise attested in the epigraphic record, could have survived into medieval Irish literature.

A confusing aspect of Caesar&#x27;s description of this cult is his reference to the &quot;many images&quot; of Gaulish Mercury; specifically he uses the word , a word which had the connotation of worshipped idols for Roman authors. Archaeological evidence of anthropomorphic cult images is scant before the Roman conquest of Gaul. The testimony of some Roman authors suggests the Gauls did not produce images of their gods, though Lucan describes the Gauls as having wooden idols. Salomon Reinach suggested that Caesar meant to draw a comparison between aniconic monuments to Gaulish Mercury and the herms (aniconic monuments to Hermes, Mercury&#x27;s Greek equivalent) he knew from Rome, but this is an unlikely use of the word .

Certainly, after Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul, depiction and worship of Mercury was widespread. More images of Mercury have been found in Roman Gaul than those of any other God, but these representations of Mercury are conventional, and show no discernible Celtic influence. Epigraphic material does reveal some bynames of Mercury peculiar to Gaul, thought to be suggestive of native gods. An inscription from Langres attests to a &quot;Mercur(io) Mocco&quot; (&quot;Mercury of the Swine&quot;), perhaps Lugus. Other epithets—connecting Mercury with heights, particular Gaulish tribes, and the emperor Augustus—have been thought to be suggestive of Lugus. The epigraphic record has not produced any epithets portraying Mercury as inventor or master of arts.

==Depictions==
No images of Lugus are known. However, a number of figures have been proposed to represent Lugus. A Gallo-Roman silver cup from Lyon is decorated with a number of figures, including a human counting money next to a raven. Pierre Wuilleumier identified the human figure as Mercury/Lugus, whereas identified the raven as Apollo/Lugus. Paula Powers Coe argued that the depiction of Mercury on could be Lugus, as a rat (Gaulish ) is depicted above Mercury, perhaps punning on Lugus&#x27;s native name. Arguing from an association between Irish Lugh and pigs, has proposed that the Euffigneix statue (of a Gaulish boar-god) is a representation of Lugus.

==Later mythology==
===Lugh in Irish mythology===
Lugh Lamfhota (literally, &quot;Long-armed Lugh&quot;) is an Irish mythological figure from the Mythological Cycle and the Ulster Cycle. He is portrayed as a leading member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, a supernatural race in medieval Irish literature often thought to represent euhemerized pre-Christian deities. Alongside Fionn mac Cumhaill and Cú Chulainn (Lugh&#x27;s supernatural son), he is one of the three great heroes of the Irish mythological tradition. The Irish celebrated Lughnasa, a harvest festival which fell on 1 August and which, according to Irish tradition, was established by Lugh in honour of his foster mother.

Arbois de Jubainville made the connection between Lugh and Lugus. He adduced two connections between Irish Lugh and Celtic Lugus. Firstly, he drew attention to the (above discussed) correspondence between Lugh&#x27;s epithet (&quot;master of all arts&quot;) and Caesar&#x27;s description of Gaulish Mercury. Secondly, he pointed out that an annual &quot;concillium&quot; of the Gauls in Lugdunum/Lyon, instituted in 12 BCE in honour of the emperor Augustus, fell on exactly the same day as Lughnasa. He suggested that both must ultimately derive from a Celtic festival in honour of Lugus. Recent scholarship has tended to dismiss this as a coincidence. Maier has pointed out that the Continental Celts used a lunar calendar, whereas the Irish used a solar calendar, so continuity of a seasonal festival would be unlikely.

===Lleu in Welsh mythology===
Lleu Llaw Gyffes (literally, &quot;Lleu of the Skillful Hand&quot; or &quot;Steady Hand&quot;) is one of the protagonists of the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, a set of Welsh stories compiled in the 12th-13th centuries. He is a prince whose story culminates in him becoming ruler of Gwynedd. Though not depicted as other than human, Lleu is depicted with extraordinary or magical skills, like many other characters in Welsh mythology. Lleu (or characters similar to him) appears in other works of medieval Welsh literature. Notable examples are Lluch Llavynnauc (Lluch &quot;of the Striking Hand&quot; or Lluch &quot;Equipped with a Blade&quot;) in &quot;Pa gur&quot;; Lluch Lleawc (Lluch &quot;the Death Dealing&quot;) in &quot;Preiddeu Annwn&quot;; and Llwch Llawwynnyawe (Lluch &quot;of the Striking Hand&quot;) in &quot;Culhwch&quot;.

John Rhys was the first to relate Lleu to Lugus, which he did in 1888. Rhys drew a comparison between an episode in the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, wherein Lleu and his foster father Gwydion produce gold-ornamented shoes, and the inscription from Uxama Argaela, where the Lugoves are invoked by a group of shoemakers. This parallel has received a mixed reception. Joseph Loth felt that the episode was minor and the conclusion extravagant. Jan de Vries agreed with Rhys, and further argued that the &quot;Lugoves&quot; in this inscription were Lleu and Gwydion.

===Lugus-Lugh-Lleu?===
Though the stories told of Lleu and Lugh do not show many similarities, comparisons have been drawn between epithets of Lleu and Lugh: Lleu is (&quot;of the Skillful Hand&quot;) and Lugh is (&quot;master of all arts&quot;); Lleu is (&quot;of the Striking Hand&quot;) and Lugh is (&quot;of the Fierce Blows&quot;). Ronald Hutton points out that medieval Welsh and Irish literature are known to have borrowed superficially from each other (for example, the similar in name but dissimilar in character Welsh Manawydan fab Llŷr and Irish Manannán mac Lir). This would suffice to explain the common epithets.

Welsh Lleu and Irish Lugh are both linguistically correct as reflexes of a Gaulish or Brittonic name Lugus. Hutton notes that a medieval borrowing cannot explain the linguistic relationship between Lugh and Lleu. For the names to be cognate, their common origin must be prior to the respective sound changes in Irish and in Welsh. Jessica Hemming argues that, insofar as Lugus is entirely absent from the epigraphic record in Britain and Ireland, the etymology is questionable.

==Reconstruction==

The god Lugus was first reconstructed by Arbois de Jubainville in his monumental (1884). Arbois de Jubainville linked together Irish Lugh, Caesar&#x27;s Gaulish Mercury, the toponym Lugdunum, and the epigraphic evidence of the Lugoves. By 1888, Sir John Rhys had linked Lugus with Welsh Lleu. Initial criticism of this theory (for example, from Henri Gaidoz) gave way to what Ovist has described as &quot;uncritical affirmation&quot; of the existence of a pan-Celtic god Lugus. Over the 20th century, the theory was further elaborated. The long inscription from Peñalba de Villastar was first published in 1942 and, by the 1950s, it had been identified as a unique dedication to Lugus in the singular. In a 1982 article, Antonio Tovar cited Lugus as an exemplar of the unity of ancient Celtic culture. Few other Celtic gods could be said to be attested in Gaulish, Insular, and Iberian sources.

Early doubts about Lugus were raised by Pierre Flobert (in the 1960s) and Stephanie Boucher (in the 1980s). However, scepticism about the god only entered the mainstream in the 1990s, coinciding with a wave of scepticism about the unity of the ancient Celts. The most important of these critiques was mounted by Bernhard Maier, in his 1996 article &quot;Is Lug to be Identified with Mercury?&quot;. As well as criticising the identification of Caesar&#x27;s Gaulish Mercury with Irish Lugh, Maier cast doubt on the value of the previously adduced epigraphic and toponymic data from Continental Europe. As Ovist put it, Maier &quot;in effect, question[ed] the very existence of Continental Lugus&quot;.

Scepticism about the existence of Lugus has not become consensus. Recent monographs on the god by Krista Ovist (2004) and Gaël Hily (2012) have reaffirmed and elaborated on Arbois de Jubainville&#x27;s reconstruction. The strength of the epigraphic and toponymic evidence has been marshalled in defense of the hypothesis by scholars such as Ovist and Zeidler.

<doc id="86577" wikidata="Q2565572" url="?curid=86577" title="Luxovius">
<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Luxovios, Latinized as Luxovius, was the god of the waters of Luxeuil, worshiped in Gaul. He was a consort of Bricta. The thermal spring sanctuary at Luxeuil provided evidence of the worship of other deities, including the sky-horseman who bears a solar wheel, and Sirona, another deity associated with healing springs.

==Inscriptions==
Luxovius is recorded in the following two inscriptions, both from Luxeuil-les-Bains :

:&quot;[Lus]soio / et Brictae / Divixti/us Cons/tans / v(otum) s(olvit) &lt;l=T&gt;(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
&quot;To Lusso(v)ios and Bricta, Divixtius Constans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot; (CIL 13, 05425)
: &quot;Luxovio / et Brixtae / G(aius) Iul(ius) Fir/manus / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
&quot;To Luxovios and Brixta, Gaius Julius Firmans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot; 
(AE 1951, 00231; CIL 13, 05426)

==Etymology==
The name Luxovios implies light symbolism, derived from a Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*leuk-&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;, &#x27;whiteness&#x27;. This may indicate that the god was a deity of both light and curative spring waters, two elements that were strongly linked in the Celtic world.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Bricta or Brixta was a Gaulish goddess who was a consort of Luxovius, god of the waters of Luxeuil-les-Bains (in antiquity, &quot;Luxovium&quot;). It is highly possible the name is related to Perchta, a later German fairy tale character, usually (though not always) described as an elderly witch queen, who has many regional names and variations amongst the Germanic Alpine peoples and seems to bear random traits associated with both the Celtic Beira/ Cailleach and the Norse/ Germanic Freyja. This would likely make Bricta the same deity as Beira.

==Inscriptions==
Bricta is recorded in the following inscriptions from Luxeuil-les-Bains :

:&quot;[Lus]soio / et Brictae / Divixti/us Cons/tans / v(otum) s(olvit) &lt;l=T&gt;(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
:&quot;To Lusso(v)ios and Bricta, Divixtius Constans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot; (CIL 13, 05425)
:&quot;Luxovio / et Brixtae / G(aius) Iul(ius) Fir/manus / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
:&quot;To Luxovios and Brixta, Gaius Julius Firmans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot; 
(AE 1951, 00231; CIL 13, 05426)

==Etymology==

This Gaulish is derived from the word &quot;brixtom&quot; or &quot;brixta&quot; meaning magic. The word also appears on the inscription of Chamalières. (Delamarre pp. 76–77 with references and comparative etymology)

<text>Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (; 5 April 1820 – 20 March 1910), known by the pseudonym Nadar () or Félix Nadar&quot;,&quot; was a French photographer, caricaturist, journalist, novelist, balloonist, and proponent of heavier-than-air flight. In 1858, he became the first person to take aerial photographs.

Photographic portraits by Nadar are held by many of the great national collections of photographs. His son, Paul Nadar, continued the studio after his death.

==Life==
Gaspard-Félix Tournachon (also known as Nadar) was born in early April 1820 in Paris, though some sources state he was born in Lyon. His father, Victor Tournachon, was a printer and bookseller. Nadar began to study medicine but quit for economic reasons after his father&#x27;s death.

Nadar started working as a caricaturist and novelist for various newspapers. He fell in with the Parisian bohemian group of Gérard de Nerval, Charles Baudelaire, and Théodore de Banville. His friends picked a nickname for him, perhaps by a playful habit of adding &quot;dar&quot; to the end of words, Tournadar, which later became Nadar. His work was published in &quot;Le Charivari&quot; for the first time in 1848. In 1849, he founded &quot;La Revue Comique à l&#x27;Usage des Gens Sérieux&quot;. He also edited &quot;Le Petit Journal pour Rire&quot;.

From work as a caricaturist, he moved on to photography. He took his first photographs in 1853, and in 1854 opened a photographic studio at 113 rue St. Lazare. In 1860 he moved to 35 Boulevard des Capucines. Nadar photographed a wide range of personalities: politicians (Guizot, Proudhon), stage actors (Sarah Bernhardt, Paulus), writers (Hugo, Baudelaire, Sand, Nerval, Gautier, Dumas), painters (Corot, Delacroix, Millet), and musicians (Liszt, Rossini, Offenbach, Verdi, Berlioz). Portrait photography was going through a period of native industrialization, and Nadar refused to use the traditional sumptuous decors; he preferred natural daylight and despised what he considered to be unnecessary accessories. In 1886, with his son Paul, he did what may be the first photo-report: an interview with the great scientist Michel Eugène Chevreul, who at the time was 100 years old. It was published in &quot;Le Journal Illustré&quot;.

In 1858, he became the first person to take aerial photographs. This was done using the wet plate collodion process, and since the plates had to be prepared and developed (a process that required a chemically neutral setting) while the basket was aloft, Nadar experienced imaging problems as gas escaped from his balloons. After Nadar invented a gas-proof cotton cover and draped it over his balloon baskets, he was able to capture stable images. He also pioneered the use of artificial lighting in photography, working in the catacombs of Paris. He was thus the first person to photograph from the air with his balloons, as well as the first to photograph underground, in the Catacombs of Paris. In 1867, he published the first magazine to focus on air travel: &quot;L&#x27;Aéronaute&quot;.

In 1863, Nadar commissioned the prominent balloonist Eugène Godard to construct an enormous balloon, high and with a capacity of , and named &quot;Le Géant&quot; (The Giant).
On his visit to Brussels with &quot;Le Géant&quot;, on 26 September 1864, Nadar erected mobile barriers to keep the crowd at a safe distance. Crowd control barriers are still known in Belgium as &quot;Nadar barriers&quot;.
&quot;Le Géant&quot; was badly damaged at the end of its second flight, but Nadar rebuilt the gondola and the envelope, and continued his flights. In 1867, he was able to take as many as a dozen passengers aloft at once, serving cold chicken and wine.

For publicity, he recreated balloon flights in his studio with his wife, Ernestine, using a rigged-up balloon gondola. He stayed a passionate aeronaut until he and Ernestine were injured in an accident in &quot;Le Géant&quot;. 

&quot;Le Géant&quot; (The Giant) inspired Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;. Nadar was the inspiration for the character of Michael Ardan in Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. In 1862, Verne and Nadar established a &quot;Société pour la recherche de la navigation aérienne&quot;, which later became &quot;La Société d&#x27;encouragement de la locomotion aérienne au moyen du plus lourd que l&#x27;air&quot; (The Society for the Encouragement of Aerial Locomotion by Means of Heavier than Air Machines). Nadar served as president and Verne as secretary.

During the Siege of Paris in 1870–71, Nadar was instrumental in organising balloon flights carrying mail to reconnect the besieged Parisians with the rest of the world, thus establishing the world&#x27;s first airmail service.

In April 1874, he lent his photo studio to a group of painters to present the first exhibition of the Impressionists. He photographed Victor Hugo on his death-bed in 1885. He is credited with having published (in 1886) the first &quot;photo-interview&quot; (of famous chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, then a centenarian). His photographs of women are notable for their natural poses and individual character. Nadar was recognized for breaking the conventions of photographic portrait, choosing to capture the subjects as active participants.

As of 1 April 1895, Nadar turned over the Paris Nadar Studio to his son Paul. He moved to Marseille, where he established another photography studio in 1897. On 3 January 1909 he returned to Paris.

Nadar died on 20 March 1910, aged 89. He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The studio continued under the direction of his son and long-term collaborator, Paul Nadar (1856–1939).

==Works==
Towards the end of his life, Nadar published &quot;Quand j&#x27;étais photographe&quot;, which was translated into English and published by MIT Press in 2015. The book is full of both anecdotes and samples of his photography, including many portraits of recognizable names.

The painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres sent some of his clients to Nadar to have their photographs taken as studies for his paintings.

<doc id="86581" wikidata="Q3020294" url="?curid=86581" title="The Sweet Hereafter (novel)">
<text>The Sweet Hereafter is a 1991 novel by American author Russell Banks. It is set in a small town in the aftermath of a deadly school bus accident that has killed most of the town&#x27;s children. The novel was adapted into an award-winning 1997 film of the same name by Canadian director Atom Egoyan.

The book was chosen in 1998 by Nancy Pearl, the then Director of the Washington Center for the Book at the Seattle Public Library, and Chris Higashi, the current Program Manager, to be the first selection for &quot;If All Seattle Read the Same Book&quot;. This program has continued in the Seattle community and at many other public libraries around the country.

==Plot==
&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; is a multiple first-person narrative depicting life in a small town in Upstate New York in the wake of a school bus accident in which many local children are killed. Their grieving parents are approached by a slick city lawyer who wants them to sue for damages. At first the parents are reluctant to do so, but eventually they are persuaded by the lawyer that filing a class action lawsuit would ease their minds and also be the right thing to do.

As most of the children are dead, the case now depends on the testimony in court of the few surviving witnesses. In particular, the deposition of 14-year-old Nichole Burnell, who was sitting at the front of the bus and is now paralyzed from the waist down by the accident, is considered all-important. However, she unexpectedly accuses the driver Dolores Driscoll of speeding and thus causing the accident. When she does so, any hope by survivors and grieving parents of receiving money are thwarted. All the people involved know that Nichole is lying but cannot do anything about it. Only her father knows why, but he is unable to publicly reveal his daughter&#x27;s motives.

The novel captures the atmosphere in a small town suddenly shaken by catastrophe. Only the reader knows that Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer, has just learned that he has effectively lost his own child—his estranged, drug-addicted daughter informs him that she has just tested HIV-positive.

==Basis of novel==
The novel was based on a 1989 bus crash in Alton, Texas and its aftermath. At 7:30 A.M. on September 21, 1989, a Coca-Cola truck hit a Mission school bus, knocking it into a gravel pit at the corner of Five-Mile Road and Bryan Road. Twenty-one children from the Alton area were drowned, and 49 were injured. This was the worst school bus accident to date in Texas history. The driver of the truck, Ruben Perez, was found to be at fault for the crash by the National Transportation Safety Board.

Some lawyers faced ethics charges in their rush to file suit after the accident. Dozens of lawyers hurried to Alton, reportedly approaching families even in the morgue and in hospitals. The soft-drink truck was owned by Valley Coca-Cola, a division of the soft drink company. The bus manufacturer was sued on the grounds that the standard rear emergency door should have been supplemented with an exit on the left side of the bus, which would have permitted most or all of the children to escape (this crash occurred only months after another bus disaster in Kentucky, in which the number of emergency exits played a role in fatalities). The community of Alton was sued by families because the pit was not thoroughly barricaded.

The State Bar of Texas sought to bring actions against lawyers whom it believed to be paying people to refer clients to them. Some families who settled soon after the accident sued again after discovering that other families had received larger settlements. The 350 lawsuits resulted in settlements totaling more than $150 million. In the end, Valley Coca-Cola paid some $144 million in claims, of which lawyers took an estimated $50 million. Families who lost children received about $4.5 million from Valley Coca-Cola for each boy or girl who died, while the 60 children who survived each received an estimated $500,000 to $900,000.

Few of the citizens of Alton attended the criminal trial for the truck driver. Many think that the money received from the lawsuits only brought the town trouble.

<text>The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), formerly the International Earth Rotation Service, is the body responsible for maintaining global time and reference frame standards, notably through its Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) and International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) groups.

==History==
The IERS was established in its present form in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, replacing the earlier International Polar Motion Service (IPMS) and the Earth rotation section of the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure (BIH). The service began operation on January 1, 1988. Since its inception, the IERS has established new bureaus including the GPS Coordinating Centre in 1990, the DORIS Coordinating Centre in 1994 and the Global Geophysical Fluids Centre in 1998. The organization was formerly known as International Earth Rotation Service until 2003 when it formally changed its name to its present form, in which the organization chose to retain the acronym IERS.

==Function==
The IERS has various components located in the United States, Europe and Australia. Among its other functions, the IERS is responsible for announcing leap seconds.

The Sub-bureau for Rapid Service and Predictions of Earth Orientation Parameters of the IERS, located at the United States Naval Observatory, monitors the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Part of its mission involves the determination of a time scale based on the current rate of the rotation of the Earth. Other services of IERS are at the Paris Observatory.

UT1 is the non-uniform time defined based on the Earth&#x27;s rotation.

It defined the IERS Reference Meridian, the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS), and subsequent International Terrestrial Reference Frames (ITRF). Related coordinate systems are used by satellite navigation systems like GPS and Galileo: WGS84 and GTRF. The definitions and relationships among ITRF, ICRF and EOP are established by IERS conventions standards. , the most recent convention is the IERS Conventions (2010).

==Earth orientation products==

A mission of the IERS is to provide earth orientation information to the greater geodesy community in the form of bulletins:

* Bulletin A provides a rapid turnaround service for providing current EOP and a prediction model for EOP up to a year in the future. It is released weekly.
* Bulletin B provides final measurements of EOP and is released monthly.
* Bulletin C provides announcements of leap seconds.
* Bulletin D provides DUT1 = (UT1 − UTC) to a 0.1 second precision.

<text>Wilhelm Maybach (; 9 February 1846 – 29 December 1929) was an early German engine designer and industrialist. During the 1890s he was hailed in France, then the world centre for car production, as the &quot;King of Designers&quot;.

From the late 19th century Wilhelm Maybach, together with Gottlieb Daimler, developed light, high-speed internal combustion engines suitable for land, water, and air use. These were fitted to the world&#x27;s first motorcycle, motorboat, and after Daimler&#x27;s death, a new automobile introduced in late 1902, the Mercedes model, built to the specifications of Emil Jellinek.

Maybach rose to become technical director of the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) but did not get along with its chairmen. As a result, Maybach left DMG in 1907 to found Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH together with his son Karl in 1909; they manufactured Zeppelin engines. After the signing of the Versailles Treaty in 1919 the company started producing large luxury vehicles, branded as &quot;Maybach&quot;. He died in 1929 and was succeeded by his son Karl Maybach. From around 1936 Maybach-Motorenbau designed and made almost all the engines fitted in German tanks and half-tracks used during World War 2, including those for the Panther, Tiger I and Tiger II heavy tanks.

Continuing after the war, Maybach Motorenbau remained a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, making diesel engines. During the 1960s Maybach came under the control of Daimler-Benz and was renamed MTU Friedrichshafen.

In 2002 the &quot;Maybach&quot; brand name was revived for a luxury make but it was not successful. On 25 November 2011 Daimler-Benz announced they would cease producing automobiles under the &quot;Maybach&quot; brand name in 2013.
In 2014, Daimler announced production of an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the new Mercedes-Maybach brand.

== Early life and career beginnings (1846 to 1869) ==

Wilhelm Maybach was born in Heilbronn, Baden-Württemberg, in 1846, the son of a carpenter and his wife Luise. He had four brothers. When he was eight years old the family moved from Löwenstein near Heilbronn to Stuttgart. His mother died in 1854 and his father in 1856.

After his relatives published an announcement in the &quot;Stuttgarter Anzeiger&quot; newspaper, a philanthropic institution at Reutlingen took in Maybach as a student. Its founder and director, Gustav Werner, discovered Maybach&#x27;s technical inclination and helped to stimulate his career by sending him to the school&#x27;s engineering workshop. At 15 years old (1861), Maybach was heading for a career in Industrial design and took extra classes in physics and mathematics at Reutlingen&#x27;s public high school.

By the time he was 19 years old, he was a qualified designer working on stationary engines. His workshop manager, Gottlieb Daimler, then 29, noticed his efforts and took him on as his main assistant, a post he held until Daimler&#x27;s death in 1900.

==Daimler and Otto&#x27;s four-stroke engine (1869 to 1880)==

In 1869, Maybach followed Daimler to Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe AG in Karlsruhe, a manufacturer of heavy locomotives. Daimler was on the Executive Committee and they spent long nights discussing new designs for engines, pumps, lumber machinery, and metalworking.

In 1872, Daimler moved to Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne, then the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of stationary gas engines. Nicolaus Otto, part owner of the company, focused on engine development with Daimler. Maybach joined them as Chief Designer.

In 1876, Nicolaus Otto patented the Otto cycle engine. It was a four-stroke cycle gas internal combustion engine with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. One of Otto&#x27;s more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned, allowing Daimler and Maybach to produce their high-speed engine.

Also in 1876, Maybach was sent to show Deutz&#x27;s engines at the Philadelphia World&#x27;s Fair (USA). On returning to Cologne in 1877, he concentrated on improving the four-stroke design to prepare it for its impending commercial launch.

In 1878, Maybach married Bertha Wilhelmine Habermaas, a friend of Daimler&#x27;s wife, Emma Kunz. Her family members were landowners who ran the post office in Maulbronn. On 6 July 1879 Karl Maybach was born, the first of their three children.

In 1880, Daimler and Otto had serious disagreements, resulting in Daimler&#x27;s leaving Deutz-AG. Daimler received 112,000 goldmarks in Deutz-AG shares as compensation for patents granted to him and Maybach. Maybach also left shortly afterwards, and followed his friend to found a new company in Cannstatt.

==Daimler Motors: fast and small engines (1882)==

In 1882, Maybach moved to Taubenheimstrasse in Cannstatt, Stuttgart, where Daimler had purchased a house with 75,000 goldmarks from his Deutz compensation. They added a brick extension to the glass-fronted summer house in the garden, which became their workshop.

Their activities alarmed the neighbours, who suspected they were engaged in counterfeiting. The police raided the property in their absence using the gardener&#x27;s key, but found only engines.

==The Daimler engine==
In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by Ligroin. This engine was patented on 16 December 1883. It achieved Daimler&#x27;s goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm (soon after up to 900). Daimler had three engines built in 1884. Maybach persuaded him to put one in a vehicle, the result being the &quot;Reitwagen&quot;.

In 1884, Maybach&#x27;s second son Adolf was born.

==The &quot;Grandfather Clock engine&quot; (1885)==
By the end of 1885, Maybach and Daimler developed the first of their engines, which is regarded as a precursor to all modern petrol engines. It featured:
* single vertical cylinder
* air cooling
* large cast-iron flywheel
* revolutionary hot tube ignition (Patent 28022)
* exhaust valve controlled by a camshaft allowing high speeds 
* a speed of 600 rpm, when at the time most engines could only achieve about 120 to 180 rpm.

In 1885, they created the first float-fed carburetor, which mixed evaporated gasoline with air to allow its efficient use as fuel. It was used that year on a larger but still compact version of the engine, now with a vertical cylinder, that featured:
* 1 Horsepower at 600 rpm output 
* 100 cc engine displacement 
* non cooled insulated cylinder with unregulated hot-tube ignition (patent DRP-28-022)
Daimler baptized it the &quot;Standuhr&quot; (lit. &quot;grandfather clock&quot;), because of its resemblance to a pendulum clock.

In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of the engine onto a wooden bicycle, creating the first motorcycle (patent 36-423 – Vehicle with gas or petroleum engine), and Maybach drove it three kilometers from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim, reaching . It became known as the &quot;Reitwagen&quot;.

On 8 March 1886, the inventors bought an American model coach built by Wilhelm Wimpff &amp; Sohn, telling the neighbors that it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler. Maybach supervised the installation of an enlarged 1.5 hp Grandfather Clock engine onto the coach, and installed a belt drive to the wheels. The vehicle reached when tested on the road to Untertürkheim.

Maybach and Daimler went on to prove the engine in many other ways, including:
* On water (1887). It was mounted in a 4.5-metre-long boat which achieved 6 knots (11 km/h). The boat was called the &quot;Neckar&quot; after the river it was tested on and was registered as patent number DRP 39-367. Motor boat engines would become their main product until the first decade of the 1900s.
* More road vehicles, including street cars
* In the air. They built the first motorized airship, a balloon based on designs by Dr. Friedrich Hermann Wölfert from Leipzig. They replaced his hand-operated drive system and flew over Seelberg successfully on 10 August 1888.

By 1887 they were licensing their first patents abroad, and Maybach represented the company at the great Paris Exposition Universelle (1889).

==First Daimler-Maybach automobile built (1889)==
Sales increased, mostly from the Neckar motorboat. In June 1887, Daimler bought land in the Seelberg Hills of Cannstatt. The workshop was some distance from the town on Ludwig Route 67, because Cannstatt&#x27;s mayor objected to the presence of the workshop in the town. It covered 2,903 square meters and cost 30,200 goldmarks. They initially employed 23 people. Daimler managed the commercial issues and Maybach the design department.

In 1889 they built their first automobile to be designed from scratch rather than as an adaptation of a stagecoach. It was publicly launched by both inventors in Paris in October 1889.

Daimler&#x27;s engine licenses began to be taken up throughout the world, starting the modern car industry in:
* France, 1890, Panhard &amp; Levassor and Peugeot
* United Kingdom, 1896, The Daimler Motor Company of Coventry
* United States of America, 1891, Steinway
* Austro-Daimler in Austria, starting in 1899

== Daimler&#x27;s &quot;pact with the devil&quot;, DMG, and the Phoenix engine (1890 to 1900) ==

Resources were scant to keep the business going, as neither the engine sales nor the worldwide proceeds from their patents were yielding enough money. Fresh capital was injected by bringing in the financiers Max von Duttenhofer and William Lorenz, former munitions makers, who were associated with Kilian von Steiner, the owner of a German investment bank. The company was taken public.

In 1890, Daimler and Maybach together founded the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, the Daimler Motor Corporation or DMG for short, which was dedicated to the construction of small high-speed internal combustion engines for land, water, or air transport. Maybach was Chief Designer. After spending long hours debating which fuel was best to use in Otto&#x27;s four-stroke engine, which had normally used methane gas as a fuel, they turned to petroleum which until then had been used mainly as a cleaner and sold in pharmacies.

The company&#x27;s re-foundation took place on 28 November 1890. This has been regarded as a &quot;pact with the devil&quot; by some German historians,
as the following decade was chaotic for Daimler and Maybach. DMG continued to expand, selling engines from Moscow to New York, and additional stationary engine-making capacity was added, but the belief continued that automobile production would not be profitable. The new chairmen planned to merge &quot;DMG&quot; and &quot;Deutz-AG&quot;, in spite of Daimler&#x27;s disagreement with Nicolaus Otto.

Gottlieb Daimler and Chief Engineer Maybach preferred to produce automobiles and reacted against Duttenhofer and Lorenz in particular. Maybach was rejected as a member of the Board of Management and left the company on 11 February 1891, and continued his design work from his own house, financed by Daimler. In late 1892, he set up a shop in the ballroom of the former Hermann Hotel and Winter Garden where he employed 17 workers, five of which were paid by Daimler.

In 1894 Maybach designed his third engine model, together with Daimler and his son Paul. Used in the Phoenix, it gained worldwide attention, pioneering the use of four cylinders in the automobile and featuring:
* single block casting of cylinders, arranged vertically and parallel to each other
* camshaft controlled exhaust valves
* spray-nozzle carburetor (patented by Maybach in 1893)
* improved belt drive

Maybach&#x27;s creations are considered among the finest motors of the late 19th century. His inventions became indispensable for any model by any automaker in the world. He became recognised as the backbone of France&#x27;s early automobile industry, where he was hailed as the &quot;King of Designers&quot;.

Daimler was forced out of his post as Technical Director at DMG and resigned in 1893, which damaged DMG&#x27;s prestige. However, in 1894, a British industrialist, Frederick Simms, purchased the rights to the Phoenix engine for 350,000 marks and stabilised the company&#x27;s finances. He also made it a condition that Daimler be re-employed. In 1895 DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, and Maybach also returned as Chief Engineer, obtaining 30,000 goldmarks worth of shares through his original contract with Gottlieb Daimler.

Maybach patented more automobile inventions, including:
* a revolutionary cooling system, tubular radiator with fan
* the honeycomb radiator

Around this time though Maybach suffered two setbacks. His teenage second son, Adolf, suffered a schizophrenia attack and spent the rest of his life in various mental institutions. (In 1940, his son was murdered by the Nazis as part of the Euthanasia Program.) In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler died of heart disease.

==Daimler-Mercedes engine of 1900==
Between April and October 1900, Maybach designed a completely new kind of car inspired by racing which would be called the Mercedes 35 hp when released in 1902. It featured:
* long wheelbase
* wide track
* low height 
* unheard-of power from its 35 hp engine allowing it to reach . 
Emil Jellinek, a successful Austrian dealer and racing driver on the French Riviera who greatly admired Maybach&#x27;s work, promised to buy a shipment of 36 automobiles for 550,000 goldmarks if Maybach could design a great race car for him following his specifications.

The prototype was finished in December 1900 and, in 1901 went on to have a string of racing successes. Its engine was baptized Daimler-Mercedes (Spanish for mercy) after Mercedes Jellinek, Emil&#x27;s 10-year–old daughter. European high society bought the car in large numbers making it the commercial success that convinced the company directors there was a future in automobiles. Production increased greatly and DMG rapidly increased in size and number of employees. DMG officially registered the Mercedes trademark in June 1902.

In 1902, a fire destroyed DMG&#x27;s Cannstatt facilities and the company moved to Stuttgart-Untertürkheim. Maybach continued with his innovations: 
* a 6-cylinder/70 hp engine (1903–04)
* a pioneer aircraft engine: a high speed racing engine of 120 hp, with overhead inlet and exhaust valves and double ignition (1906)

DMG demoted him to an &quot;Inventor&#x27;s Office&quot; causing him to leave the company again in 1907. DMG replaced him with Paul Daimler. That same year, the German Engineers Association (VDI) recognized Wilhelm Maybach as an honorary member.

==Zeppelin engines (1908)==
In 1900, Maybach had his first contact with Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who sought to improve the engines of the Zeppelin LZ1 airship. Maybach built some engines for him based on sketches of a 150 hp unit created by his son, Karl, while at DMG.

In 1908, Count Zeppelin attempted to sell his models &quot;LZ3&quot; and &quot;LZ4&quot; to the government. On 5 August, &quot;LZ4&quot; exploded against a row of trees after attempting an emergency landing when its engines failed. This was far from being the end for the airship project as 6.25 million goldmarks were raised in a donation campaign after the accident. Count Zeppelin founded the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, the company that built the Zeppelin airships.

Maybach had to hold off joining the new company for a while as he was still in litigation with DMG, so Karl took his place. On 23 March 1909, a deal was finally signed, creating an engine subsidiary to Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at Bissingen/Enz, in Württemberg. Wilhelm Maybach was Technical Assistant and Karl was Technical Manager. Their first designs reached 72 km/h (45 mph).

Wilhelm Maybach moved his company to Friedrichshafen and renamed it &quot;Luftfahrzeug-Motoren-GmbH&quot;. Karl and Wilhem held 20% of the shares with an arrangement for Karl to inherit. They kept supplying &quot;Zeppelin&quot;, but worked on other airship engines too. In 1912, the company adopted the name Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH (Maybach Engine Construction Company). In 1916, they developed a 160 hp aircraft engine which sold 2000 units before the end of World War I. In 1916, Wilhelm Maybach was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Technical University of Stuttgart.

==Maybach automobiles (1922–1945)==
After the First World War, the Versailles Treaty of 1919 prohibited airship production in Germany, so Maybach turned to making high-speed diesel engines for naval and railroad use, and petrol engines for automobiles, but not complete automobiles.

Many of the small automakers in Germany built their own engines for cost reasons and only the Dutch Spyker company was interested in taking Maybach engines. Wilhelm Maybach turned down the contract because he could not agree to its conditions. Instead, he opted to build complete automobiles and the factory began to produce Maybach limousines in 1921.

The first model, the Maybach W3, was shown at the 1921 Automobile Exposition in Berlin and featured
* 6-cylinder engine
* 4-wheel brakes
* new transmission system
* maximum speed of 
It was produced until 1928, selling 300 units, mostly with sedan bodies; the two-seat sport version was less successful. The Maybach W5 followed, with the top speed increased to ; 250 units sold in 1927 and 1929.

Next Maybach produced the V12 car:
* the first 12-cylinder German automobile
* lightweight aluminium engine based on his airship work
* light alloy pistons
* 7-litre capacity 
* high torque and power – at 2,800 rpm
Only a few dozen were sold due to the German postwar economic crisis. In 1930, its successor, the DS7-Zeppelin, also featured a 12-cylinder engine of 7 liters.

In August 1929, the Zeppelin LZ-127 used five Maybach-V12 petrol engines of each.

Neither Wilhelm nor Karl owned a Maybach automobile. Wilhelm never even owned a car. &quot;He, who created the basics for the modern automobilism, rarely utilized a car for his personal purposes. He walked or took the tram. Although he could have afforded one, he did not own a car.&quot;

Wilhelm Maybach died at the age of 83 in Stuttgart on 29 December 1929.

==Maybach Motorenbau GmbH==
His business, Maybach Motorenbau GmbH, continued in Friedrichshafen under his son Karl Maybach. From around 1935 Maybach made and designed almost all the engines for tanks and half-tracks used by the German armed forces during World War 2. After 1945 it manufactured a full range of diesel engines. In the early 1960s Maybach began to construct large Daimler-Benz engines in Friedrichshafen under a licence agreement and entered close collaboration with Daimler-Benz.

During the mid 1960s Maybach Motorenbau GmbH became Maybach Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau GmbH and 83 percent owned by Daimler-Benz.

In 1998 Mercedes-Benz announced what would prove to be a temporary revival of the Maybach brand for automobiles. Daimler AG currently produces an ultra luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach brand.

<text>Military science is the study of military processes, institutions, and behavior, along with the study of warfare, and the theory and application of organized coercive force. It is mainly focused on theory, method, and practice of producing military capability in a manner consistent with national defense policy. Military science serves to identify the strategic, political, economic, psychological, social, operational, technological, and tactical elements necessary to sustain relative advantage of military force; and to increase the likelihood and favorable outcomes of victory in peace or during a war. Military scientists include theorists, researchers, experimental scientists, applied scientists, designers, engineers, test technicians, and other military personnel.

Military personnel obtain weapons, equipment, and training to achieve specific strategic goals. Military science is also used to establish enemy capability as part of technical intelligence.

In military history, military science had been used during the period of Industrial Revolution as a general term to refer to all matters of military theory and technology application as a single academic discipline, including that of the deployment and employment of troops in peacetime or in battle.

In military education, military science is often the name of the department in the education institution that administers officer candidate education. However, this education usually focuses on the officer leadership training and basic information about employment of military theories, concepts, methods and systems, and graduates are not military scientists on completion of studies, but rather junior military officers.

==History==

Even until the Second World War, military science was written in English starting with capital letters, and was thought of as an academic discipline alongside physics, philosophy and the medical sciences. In part this was due to the general mystique that accompanied education in a world where, as late as the 1880s, 75% of the European population was illiterate. The ability by the officers to make complex calculations required for the equally complex &quot;evolutions&quot; of the troop movements in linear warfare that increasingly dominated the Renaissance and later history, and the introduction of the gunpowder weapons into the equation of warfare only added to the veritable arcana of building fortifications as it seemed to the average individual.

Until the early 19th century, one observer, a British veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, Major John Mitchell, thought that it seemed nothing much had changed from the application of force on a battlefield since the days of the Greeks. He suggested that this was primarily so because as Clausewitz suggested, &quot;unlike in any other science or art, in war the object reacts&quot;.

Until this time, and even after the Franco-Prussian War, military science continued to be divided between the formal thinking of officers brought up in the &quot;shadow&quot; of the Napoleonic Wars and younger officers like Ardant du Picq who tended to view fighting performance as rooted in the individual&#x27;s and group psychology and suggested detailed analysis of this. This set in motion the eventual fascination of the military organisations with application of quantitative and qualitative research to their theories of combat; the attempt to translate military thinking as philosophic concepts into concrete methods of combat.

Military implements, the supply of an army, its organization, tactics, and discipline, have constituted the elements of military science in all ages; but improvement in weapons and accoutrements appears to lead and control all the rest.

The breakthrough of sorts made by Clausewitz in suggesting eight principles on which such methods can be based, in Europe, for the first time presented an opportunity to largely remove the element of chance and error from command decision making process. At this time emphasis was made on the topography (including trigonometry), military art (military science), military history, organisation of the army in the field, artillery and the science of projectiles, field fortifications and permanent fortifications, military legislation, military administration and manoeuvres.

The military science on which the model of German combat operations was built for the First World War remained largely unaltered from the Napoleonic model, but took into the consideration the vast improvements in the firepower and the ability to conduct &quot;great battles of annihilation&quot; through rapid concentration of force, strategic mobility, and the maintenance of the strategic offensive better known as the Cult of the offensive. The key to this, and other modes of thinking about war, remained analysis of military history and attempts to derive tangible lessons that could be replicated again with equal success on another battlefield as a sort of bloody laboratory of military science. Few were bloodier than the fields of the Western Front between 1914 and 1918. The person who probably understood Clausewitz better than most, Marshal Foch, initially participated in events that nearly destroyed the French Army.

It is not, however, true to say that military theorists and commanders were suffering from some collective case of stupidity. Their analysis of military history convinced them that decisive and aggressive strategic offensive was the only doctrine of victory, and feared that overemphasis of firepower, and the resultant dependence on entrenchment would make this all but impossible, and leading to the battlefield stagnant in advantages of the defensive position, destroying troop morale and willingness to fight. Because only the offensive could bring victory, lack of it, and not the firepower, was blamed for the defeat of the Imperial Russian Army in the Russo-Japanese War. Foch thought that &quot;In strategy as well as in tactics one attacks&quot;.

In many ways military science was born as a result of the experiences of the Great War. &quot;Military implements&quot; had changed armies beyond recognition with cavalry to virtually disappear in the next 20 years. The &quot;supply of an army&quot; would become a science of logistics in the wake of massive armies, operations and troops that could fire ammunition faster than it could be produced, for the first time using vehicles that used the combustion engine, a watershed of change. Military &quot;organisation&quot; would no longer be that of the linear warfare, but assault teams, and battalions that were becoming multi-skilled with the introduction of machine guns and mortars and, for the first time, forcing military commanders to think not only in terms of rank and file, but force structure.

Tactics changed, too, with infantry for the first time segregated from the horse-mounted troops, and required to cooperate with tanks, aircraft and new artillery tactics. Perception of military discipline, too, had changed. Morale, despite strict disciplinarian attitudes, had cracked in all armies during the war, but the best-performing troops were found to be those where emphasis on discipline had been replaced with display of personal initiative and group cohesiveness such as that found in the Australian Corps during the Hundred Days Offensive. The military sciences&#x27; analysis of military history that had failed European commanders was about to give way to a new military science, less conspicuous in appearance, but more aligned to the processes of science of testing and experimentation, the scientific method, and forever &quot;wed&quot; to the idea of the superiority of technology on the battlefield.

Currently military science still means many things to different organisations. In the United Kingdom and much of the European Union the approach is to relate it closely to the civilian application and understanding. For example, in Belgium&#x27;s Royal Military Academy, military science remains an academic discipline, and is studied alongside social sciences, including such subjects as humanitarian law. The United States Department of Defense defines military science in terms of specific systems and operational requirements, and include among other areas civil defense and force structure.

==Employment of military skills==
In the first instance military science is concerned with who will participate in military operations, and what sets of skills and knowledge they will require to do so effectively and somewhat ingeniously.

===Military organization===

Develops optimal methods for the administration and organization of military units, as well as the military as a whole. In addition, this area studies other associated aspects as mobilization/demobilization, and military government for areas recently conquered (or liberated) from enemy control.

===Force structuring===
Force structuring is the method by which personnel and the weapons and equipment they use are organized and trained for military operations, including combat. Development of force structure in any country is based on strategic, operational, and tactical needs of the national defense policy, the identified threats to the country, and the technological capabilities of the threats and the armed forces.

Force structure development is guided by doctrinal considerations of strategic, operational and tactical deployment and employment of formations and units to territories, areas and zones where they are expected to perform their missions and tasks. Force structuring applies to all armed services, but not to their supporting organisations such as those used for defense science research activities.

In the United States force structure is guided by the table of organization and equipment (TOE or TO&amp;E). The TOE is a document published by the U.S. Department of Defense which prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of corps and armies.

Force structuring also provides information on the mission and capabilities of specific units, as well as the unit&#x27;s current status in terms of posture and readiness. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines which allows for more efficient financing, training, and employment of like units operationally.

===Military education and training===

Studies the methodology and practices involved in training soldiers, NCOs (non-commissioned officers, i.e. sergeants and corporals), and officers. It also extends this to training small and large units, both individually and in concert with one another for both the regular and reserve organizations. Military training, especially for officers, also concerns itself with general education and political indoctrination of the armed forces.

==Military concepts and methods==
Much of capability development depends on the concepts which guide use of the armed forces and their weapons and equipment, and the methods employed in any given theatre of war or combat environment.

===Military history===

Military activity has been a constant process over thousands of years, and the essential tactics, strategy, and goals of military operations have been unchanging throughout history. As an example, one notable maneuver is the double envelopment, considered to be the consummate military maneuver, notably executed by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE, and later by Khalid ibn al-Walid at the Battle of Walaja in 633 CE.

Via the study of history, the military seeks to avoid past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned. The main areas military history includes are the history of wars, battles, and combats, history of the military art, and history of each specific military service.

===Military strategy and doctrines===

Military strategy is in many ways the centerpiece of military science. It studies the specifics of planning for, and engaging in combat, and attempts to reduce the many factors to a set of principles that govern all interactions of the field of battle. In Europe these principles were first defined by Clausewitz in his Principles of War. As such, it directs the planning and execution of battles, operations, and wars as a whole. Two major systems prevail on the planet today. Broadly speaking, these may be described as the &quot;Western&quot; system, and the &quot;Russian&quot; system. Each system reflects and supports strengths and weakness in the underlying society.

Modern Western military art is composed primarily of an amalgam of French, German, British, and American systems. The Russian system borrows from these systems as well, either through study, or personal observation in the form of invasion (Napoleon&#x27;s War of 1812, and The Great Patriotic War), and form a unique product suited for the conditions practitioners of this system will encounter. The system that is produced by the analysis provided by military art is known as doctrine.

Western military doctrine relies heavily on technology, the use of a well-trained and empowered NCO cadre, and superior information processing and dissemination to provide a level of battlefield awareness that opponents cannot match. Its advantages are extreme flexibility, extreme lethality, and a focus on removing an opponent&#x27;s C3I (command, communications, control, and intelligence) to paralyze and incapacitate rather than destroying their combat power directly (hopefully saving lives in the process). Its drawbacks are high expense, a reliance on difficult-to-replace personnel, an enormous logistic train, and a difficulty in operating without high technology assets if depleted or destroyed.

Soviet military doctrine (and its descendants, in CIS countries) relies heavily on masses of machinery and troops, a highly educated (albeit very small) officer corps, and pre-planned missions. Its advantages are that it does not require well educated troops, does not require a large logistic train, is under tight central control, and does not rely on a sophisticated C3I system after the initiation of a course of action. Its disadvantages are inflexibility, a reliance on the shock effect of mass (with a resulting high cost in lives and material), and overall inability to exploit unexpected success or respond to unexpected loss.

Chinese military doctrine is currently in a state of flux as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army is evaluating military trends of relevance to China. Chinese military doctrine is influenced by a number of sources including an indigenous classical military tradition characterized by strategists such as Sun Tzu, Western and Soviet influences, as well as indigenous modern strategists such as Mao Zedong. One distinctive characteristic of Chinese military science is that it places emphasis on the relationship between the military and society as well as viewing military force as merely one part of an overarching grand strategy.

Each system trains its officer corps in its philosophy regarding military art. The differences in content and emphasis are illustrative. The United States Army principles of war are defined in the U.S. Army Field Manual FM 100–5. The Canadian Forces principles of war/military science are defined by Land Forces Doctrine and Training System (LFDTS) to focus on &quot;principles of command&quot;, &quot;principles of war&quot;, &quot;operational art and campaign planning&quot;, and &quot;scientific principles&quot;.

Russian Federation armed forces derive their principles of war predominantly from those developed during the existence of the Soviet Union. These, although based significantly on the Second World War experience in conventional war fighting, have been substantially modified since the introduction of the nuclear arms into strategic considerations. The Soviet–Afghan War and the First and Second Chechen Wars further modified the principles that Soviet theorists had divided into the operational art and tactics. The very scientific approach to military science thinking in the Soviet union had been perceived as overly rigid at the tactical level, and had affected the training in the Russian Federation&#x27;s much reduced forces to instil greater professionalism and initiative in the forces.

The military principles of war of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army were loosely based on those of the Soviet Union until the 1980s when a significant shift begun to be seen in a more regionally-aware, and geographically-specific strategic, operational and tactical thinking in all services. The PLA is currently influenced by three doctrinal schools which both conflict and complement each other: the People&#x27;s war, the Regional war, and the Revolution in military affairs that led to substantial increase in the defense spending and rate of technological modernisation of the forces.

The differences in the specifics of military art notwithstanding, military science strives to provide an integrated picture of the chaos of battle, and illuminate basic insights that apply to all combatants, not just those who agree with your formulation of the principles.

===Military geography===

Military geography encompasses much more than simple protestations to take the high ground. Military geography studies the obvious, the geography of theatres of war, but also the additional characteristics of politics, economics, and other natural features of locations of likely conflict (the political &quot;landscape&quot;, for example). As an example, the Soviet–Afghan War was predicated on the ability of the Soviet Union to not only successfully invade Afghanistan, but also to militarily and politically flank the Islamic Republic of Iran simultaneously.

==Military systems==
How effectively and efficiently militaries accomplish their operations, missions and tasks is closely related not only to the methods they use, but the equipment and weapons they use.

===Military intelligence===

Military intelligence supports the combat commanders&#x27; decision making process by providing intelligence analysis of available data from a wide range of sources. To provide that informed analysis the commanders information requirements are identified and input to a process of gathering, analysis, protection, and dissemination of information about the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces and the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and broader area of interest. Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during the war.

Most militaries maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services. Personnel selected for intelligence duties, whether specialist intelligence officers and enlisted soldiers or non-specialist assigned to intelligence may be selected for their analytical abilities and intelligence before receiving formal training.

Military intelligence serves to identify the threat, and provide information on understanding best methods and weapons to use in deterring or defeating it.

===Military logistics===

The art and science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces. In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with the design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of material; the movement, evacuation, and hospitalization of personnel; the acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation, and disposition of facilities; and the acquisition or furnishing of services.

===Military technology and equipment===
Military technology is not just the study of various technologies and applicable physical sciences used to increase military power. It may also extend to the study of production methods of military equipment, and ways to improve performance and reduce material and/or technological requirements for its production. An example is the effort expended by Nazi Germany to produce artificial rubbers and fuels to reduce or eliminate their dependence on imported POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) and rubber supplies.

Military technology is unique only in its application, not in its use of basic scientific and technological achievements. Because of the uniqueness of use, military technological studies strive to incorporate evolutionary, as well as the rare revolutionary technologies, into their proper place of military application.

==Military and society==
This speciality examines the ways that military and society interact and shape each other. The dynamic intersection where military and society meet is influenced by trends in society and the security environment. This field of study can be linked to works by Clausewitz (&quot;War is the continuation of politics by other means&quot;) and Sun Tzu (&quot;If not in the interest of the state, do not act&quot; ). The contemporary multi and interdisciplinary field traces its origin to World War II and works by sociologists and political scientists. This field of study includes &quot;all aspects of relations between armed forces, as a political, social and economic institution, and the society, state or political ethnic movement of which they are a part&quot;. Topics often included within the purview of military and society include: veterans, women in the military, military families, enlistment and retention, reserve forces, military and religion, military privatization, civil-military relations, civil-military cooperation, military and popular culture, military and the media, military and disaster assistance, military and the environment and the blurring of military and police functions.

===Recruitment and retention===
In an all-volunteer military, the armed forces relies on market forces and careful recruiting to fill its ranks. It is thus, very important to understand factors that motivate enlistment and reenlistment. Service members must have the mental and physical ability to meet the challenges of military service and adapt to the military&#x27;s values and culture. Studies show that enlistment motivation generally incorporates both self-interest (pay) and non-market values like adventure, patriotism, and comradeship.

===Veterans===
The study of veterans or members of the military who leave and return to the society is one of the most important subfields of the military and society field of study. Veterans and their issues represent a microcosm of the field. Military recruits represent inputs that flow from the community into the armed forces, veterans are outputs that leave the military and reenter society changed by their time as soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen. Both society and veteran face multiple layers of adaptation and adjustment upon their reentry.

The definition of veteran is surprisingly fluid across countries. In the US, veteran&#x27;s status is established after a service member has completed a minimum period of service. Australia requires deployment to a combat zone. In the UK &quot;Everyone who has performed military service for at least one day and drawn a day&#x27;s pay is termed a veteran.&quot; The study of veterans focuses much attention on their, sometimes, uneasy transition back to civilian society. &quot;Veterans must navigate a complex cultural transition when moving between environments,&quot; and they can expect positive and negative transition outcomes. Finding a good job and reestablishing a fulfilling family life is high on their resettlement agenda.

Military life is often violent and dangerous. The trauma of combat often results in post-traumatic stress disorder as well as painful physical health challenges which often lead to homelessness, suicide, substance, and excessive alcohol use, and family dysfunction. Society recognizes its responsibilities to veterans by offering programs and policies designed to redress these problems. Veterans also exert an influence on society often through the political process. For example, how do veterans vote and establish party affiliation? During the 2004 presidential election veterans were basically bipartisan. Veterans who fought in Croatia&#x27;s war of independence voted for the nationalist parties in greater numbers.

===Reserve forces===
Reserve forces are service members who serve the armed forces on a part-time basis. These men and women constitute a &quot;reserve&quot; force that countries rely on for their defense, disaster support, and some day-to-day operations etc. In the United States an active reservist spends a weekend a month and two weeks a year in training. The size of a county&#x27;s reserve force often depends on the type of recruitment method. Nations with a volunteer force tend to have a lower reserve percentage.

Recently the role of the reserves has changed. In many countries it has gone from a strategic force, largely static, to an operational force, largely dynamic. After WWII, relatively large standing forces took care of most operational needs. Reserves were held back strategically and deployed in times of emergency for example during the Cuban missile crisis. Subsequently, the strategic and budget situation changed and as a result the active duty military began to rely on reserve force, particularly for combat support and combat service support. Further large-scale military operation, routinely mobilize and deploy reservists 

Lomsky-Feder et al (2008p. 594) introduced the metaphor of reserve forces as &quot;transmigrants&quot; who live &quot;betwixt and between the civilian and military worlds&quot;. This metaphor captures &quot;their structural duality&quot; and suggests dynamic nature of reservist experience as they navigate commitments to their often conflicting civilian and military worlds. Given their greater likelihood of lengthy deployment, reservists face many of the same stresses as active duty but often with fewer support services.

==International military sciences or studies associations==
There are many international associations with the core purpose of bringing scholars in the field of Military Science together. Some are inter-disciplinary and have a broad scope, whilst others are confined and specialized focusing on more specific disciplines or subjects. Some are integrated in larger scientific communities like the International Sociological Association (ISA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) where others have grown out of military institutions or individuals who have had a particular interest in areas of military science and are military, defense or armed forces oriented. Some of these associations are:
* American Psychological Association; Division 19: Society for Military Psychology (APA-Div19)
* European Research Group on Military and Society (ERGOMAS)
* Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society (IUS)
* International Congress on Soldiers Physical Performance (ICSPP) 
* International Military Testing Association (IMTA)
* International Society of Military Sciences (ISMS)
* International Sociological Association; RC01 Armed Forces and Conflict Resolution

<text>Culhwch (, with the final consonant sounding like Scottish &quot;loch&quot;), in Welsh mythology, is the son of Cilydd son of Celyddon and Goleuddydd, a cousin of Arthur and the protagonist of the story &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (the earliest of the medieval Welsh tales appended to Lady Charlotte Guest&#x27;s edition of the Mabinogion). In this tale the etymology of &quot;Culhwch&quot; is explained as &quot;sow run&quot; (&quot;cul&quot; &quot;narrow, a narrow thing&quot;; &quot;hwch&quot; &quot;sow, pig&quot;), but this is likely to be folk etymology. According to the narrative, Culhwch is born to his maddened mother Goleuddydd after she is frightened by a herd of swine. The swineherd finds Culhwch in the pigs&#x27; run, and takes him back to his father Cilydd. Culhwch is described as being &quot;of gentle lineage&quot;.

==In &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;==
Culhwch&#x27;s father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&#x27;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance.

Arthur agrees to help, and sends six warriors to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. They travel onwards until they come across the &quot;fairest of the castles of the world&quot;, and meet Ysbaddaden&#x27;s shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered twenty-three of the shepherd&#x27;s children out of cruelty. The warrior Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu with his life. Custennin sets up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden&#x27;s castle. 

The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant&#x27;s hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (&quot;anoethau&quot;), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner Mabon ap Modron. Culhwch accepts the giant&#x27;s child and, with the help of Arthur and his knights, eventually completes the numerous tasks.

With the &quot;anoethau&quot; completed, Culhwch, Goreu and others who &quot;wished ill to Ysbaddaden Bencawr&quot; ride to his court. The giant&#x27;s beard, skin and flesh are shaved off by Caw of Pictland and, accepting his humiliation and defeat, he is dragged away by Goreu, who avenges his murdered brothers by beheading the giant. Ysbaddaden&#x27;s head is placed on the spike of the citadel, Goreu claims his uncle&#x27;s lands as his own, and Olwen is free to marry her love.

==Other appearances==
A brief reference to Culhwch is made in &quot;Marwnad Cynddylan&quot;, a probably seventh-century &quot;awdl&quot;-poem, in which the mythological hero is compared to the deceased Cynddylan, a seventh-century ruler of Pengwern.

<text>In Welsh mythology, Olwen (or Olwyn) is the daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden and cousin of Goreu. She is the heroine of the story &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; in the Mabinogion. Her father is fated to die if she ever marries, so when Culhwch (sometimes spelled as Kilhwch) comes to court her, he is given a series of immensely difficult tasks which he must complete before he can win her hand. With the help of his cousin King Arthur, Culhwch succeeds and the giant dies, allowing Olwen to marry her suitor.

==Description==
In the tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; in the Mabinogion, she is described as a vision of beauty: wearing a flaming-red dress with a red-gold torc and many golden rings, she has &quot;hair yellower than the broom&quot;, red (ruddy) cheeks, white skin and pale hands. She is also depicted as having the ability to spring white flowers from every step she takes.

==Other tales==
The name &quot;Olwen&quot; reappears in the non-Arthurian folktale &quot;Einion and Olwen&quot;, about a sheep herder who travels to the Otherworld to marry Olwen; they later have a son named Taliesin. The tale was collected at the turn of the 20th century but is related to &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.

English author and publisher of the Mabinogion, Lady Charlotte Guest noted that Olwen became the object of later poetry by Dafydd ap Gwilym and Sion Brwynog. The latter begins a poem with the verse &quot;Olwen gulael lan galon&quot; (&quot;Olwen of slender eyebrow, pure of heart&quot;).

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name Olwen is &quot;white footprint&quot; or &quot;white track&quot;. According to legend, she was so gentle and fragile that white trefoils would grow in her footprints. Some authorities consider her to have been originally a solar goddess, based on the etymology of her name and light-related attributes.

Professor John T. Koch states that &quot;recent Welsh generally employs &quot;olwyn&quot; rather than &quot;rhod&quot; for &#x27;wheel&#x27;.&quot;

==Notable persons with this name==
*Olwen Brogan, British archaeologist
*Lady Olwen Carey Evans, DBE, daughter of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George
*Olwen Fouéré, Breton-Irish actress on stage and in film
*Dame Olwen Hufton, British historian of early modern Europe, women&#x27;s history and social history
*Olwen Wymark, American playwright and author
* Olwen Davies, Headmistress of St Swithun&#x27;s School and St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, and sister of the conductor Meredith Davies
* British singer, actress Petula Clark born Petula Sally Olwen Clark.
*Olwen Burton, American physicist and scientist.

<text>; &quot;Ysbaddaden, Chief of Giants&quot; (from roots meaning &quot;hawthorn&quot; or &quot;infertile&quot; - or perhaps implying both meanings), is the primary antagonist of the Welsh romance &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. A vicious giant residing in a nigh unreachable castle, he is the father of Olwen and uncle of Goreu fab Custennin.

Culhwch&#x27;s father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When Cilydd remarries after brutally murdering his new wife’s former husband, King Doged, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&#x27;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance.

Arthur agrees to help, and sends six warriors to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. They travel onwards until they come across the &quot;fairest of the castles of the world&quot;, and meet Ysbaddaden&#x27;s shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd&#x27;s twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbaddaden&#x27;s castle. The warrior Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu, with his life.

The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant&#x27;s hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he complete a number of impossible tasks (&quot;anoethau&quot;), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner Mabon ap Modron. Culhwch accepts the giant&#x27;s challenge and, with the help of Arthur and his knights, eventually completes the numerous tasks.

With the &quot;anoethau&quot; completed, Culhwch, Goreu and others who &quot;wished ill to Ysbaddaden Bencawr&quot; ride to his court. The giant&#x27;s beard, skin and flesh are shaved off by Caw of Pictland and, accepting his humiliation and defeat, he is dragged away by Goreu, who avenges his murdered brothers by beheading the giant. Ysbaddaden&#x27;s head is placed on the spike of the citadel, Goreu claims his uncle&#x27;s lands as his own, and Olwen is free to marry her love.

Although medical interpretation by modern authors is frought, it is notable that Ysbaddaden’s name might imply the infertility and dermatitis (red and white scaly skin mimicking the red and white flowers of hawthorn) which accompanies gigantism caused by acromegaly. Additionally, wounds given the giant can be read as descriptions of arthritis and other features of acromegaly.

<text>In Irish mythology, &#x27; (modern spelling: &#x27;, meaning &#x27;delightful plain&#x27;) is one of the names for the Celtic Otherworld, a mythical realm achievable through death and/or glory. Unlike the underworld in some mythologies, was a pleasurable paradise, identified as either an island far to the west of Ireland or a kingdom beneath the ocean. However, was similar to the fields of Elysium in Greek mythology, and similarly was accessible only to a select few. Furthermore, , like the numerous other mystical islands said to be off the coast of Ireland, was never explicitly stated in any surviving mythological account to be an afterlife. Rather, it is usually portrayed as a paradise populated by deities, which is occasionally visited by some adventurous mortals. In its island guise, it was visited by various legendary Irish heroes and monks, forming the basis of the adventure myth or as defined by Myles Dillon in his book &quot;Early Irish Literature&quot;. This otherworld is a place where sickness and death do not exist, a place of eternal youth and beauty. Here, music, strength, life, and all pleasurable pursuits come together in a single place. Here, happiness lasts forever, and no one wants for food or drink. It is something of an Irish equivalent to the Valhalla of the Norse as well as the Elysium of the Greeks.

Legends say its ruler is the sea god Manannán mac Lir, or less often the Fomorian King Tethra. &#x27;s allure extended from the pagan era to Christian times. In later stories, the realm is less an otherworld destination than an earthly paradise which adventurers could reach by traveling west from Ireland, often blown off course by providential tempests while on an inspired mission. They typically explore many other fantastic islands before reaching their destination and returning home (or sailing on). Among these legendary voyagers are St. Brendan, , and .

<text>In Irish mythology, Tethra of the Fomorians ruled Mag Mell after dying in the Second Battle of Mag Tuiredh. After the battle, his sword, Orna, was taken by Ogma and it then recounted everything it had done.

==Etymology==
Tethra may be derived from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;*tet(e)ro-&quot; meaning &#x27;quacking sound&#x27;.
Tethra means both sea and scald-crow Badb or Roynston&#x27;s crow in Old Irish.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Tethra&quot; is the name of an armor set for the Highlander in &quot;For Honor&quot;.

==Music==
&quot;Tethra&quot; is the name of an Italian Melancholic Doom Death Metal band started in 2008, which is still active.

Ogives Big Band released a song called &#x27;Tethra&#x27; on their EP &#x27;HARM&#x27; in October 2019 with an accompanying music video.

<text>Mannans are polymers containing the sugar mannose as a principal component.
They are a type of polysaccharide found in hemicellulose, a major source of biomass found in higher plants such as softwoods. These polymers also typically contain two other sugars, galactose and glucose. They are often branched (unlike cellulose).

== Structural diversity ==
Plant mannans have β(1-4) linkages, occasionally with α(1-6) galactose branches, forming galactomannans. They are insoluble and a form of storage polysaccharide. Ivory nut is a source of mannans. An additional type is galactoglucomannan found in soft wood with a mixed mannose/glucose β(1-4) backbone. Many mannans are acetylated and some from marine sources, have sulfate esters side chains.

Yeast and some plants such as conjac and salep have a different type of mannans in their cell wall, with a α(1-6) linked backbone and α(1-2) and α(1-3) linked glucose branches, hence &quot;glucomannan&quot;. It is water soluble. It is serologically similar to structures found on mammalian glycoproteins. Detection of mannan leads to lysis in the mannan-binding lectin pathway.

==Synthesis and degradation==

GDP-mannose is a substrate for glycosyltransferase for enzymes called mannosyltransferases.

==Biosynthesis==
GDP-mannose is produced from GTP and mannose-6-phosphate by the enzyme mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase.

The degradation of mannans (and many related forms of hemicellulose) has been well studied. The hydrolysis of the main mannan backbone is catalyzed by various enzymes including β-mannosidase, β-glucosidase, and β-mannase. The side chains are degraded by esterases and α-galactosidase.

When a long chain of mannan is hydrolyzed into shorter chains, these smaller molecules are known as mannan oligosaccharide (MOS). MOS by definition can be produced from either insoluble galactomannan or soluble glucomannan, although the latter type is more widely marketed.

Glucomannan MOS is used as prebiotics in animal husbandry and nutritional supplements due to its bioactivity.

==Etymology==
From &#x27;manna&#x27;, produced by several species of tree and shrub e.g. &quot;Fraxinus ornus&quot; from whose secretions mannitol was originally isolated.

<doc id="86607" wikidata="Q203230" url="?curid=86607" title="Maponos">
<text>In ancient Celtic religion, Maponos or Maponus (&quot;Great Son&quot;) is a god of youth known mainly in northern Britain but also in Gaul. In Roman Britain, he was equated with Apollo.

The Welsh mythological figure Mabon ap Modron is apparently derived from Maponos, who by analogy we may suggest was the son of the mother-goddess Dea Matrona. The Irish god Aengus, also known as the &quot;Mac Óg&quot; (&quot;young son&quot;), is probably related to Maponos.

==Etymology==
In Gaulish, &quot;mapos&quot; means a young boy or a son. The suffix &quot;-onos&quot; is augmentative. Besides the theonym &quot;Maponos&quot;, the root &quot;mapos&quot; is found in personal names such as &quot;Mapodia&quot;, &quot;Mapillus&quot;, and &quot;Maponius&quot;; &quot;mapo&quot; is also found in the Carjac inscription (RIG L-86). The root is Proto-Indo-European &quot;*makʷos&quot;. (Delamarre 2003 pp. 216–217).

In Insular Celtic languages, the same root is found in Welsh, Cornish and Breton &quot;mab&quot; meaning &quot;son&quot; (Delamarre 2003 pp. 216–217), derived from Common Brythonic &quot;*mapos&quot; (identical to Gaulish). In Old Irish, &quot;macc&quot; also means &quot;son&quot;; it is found in Ogham inscriptions as the genitive &quot;maqui&quot;, &quot;maqqi&quot;, &quot;maqui&quot; (Sims-Williams 2003 pp. 430–431) with a geminative expressive doubling &quot;*makʷkʷos&quot;. (This is the source of Scottish and Irish names starting &quot;Mac&quot; or &quot;Mc&quot; as well as Welsh or Cornish names &quot;Ap,&quot; often shortened to just &#x27;P-).

He therefore personified youthfulness, which would explain the syncretism with the Graeco-Roman god Apollo.

==Evidence for Maponos==
===Epigraphy===
The evidence is mainly epigraphic. Maponos (“Great Son”) is mentioned in Gaul at Bourbonne-les-Bains (CIL 13, 05924) and at Chamalières (RIG L-100) but is attested chiefly in the north of Britain at Brampton, Corbridge (ancient Coria), Ribchester (In antiquity, Bremetenacum Veteranorum) and Chesterholm (in antiquity, Vindolanda). Some inscriptions are very simple such as &quot;Deo Mapono&quot; (&quot;to the god Maponos&quot;) from Chesterholm (AE 1975, 00568). At Corbridge are two dedications (RIB 1120 and RIB 1121) &quot;Apollini Mapono&quot; (&quot;to Apollo Maponos&quot;) and one (RIB 1122) &quot;[Deo] / [M]apo[no] / Apo[llini]&quot; (&quot;to the god Maponos Apollo&quot;). The inscription at Brampton (RIB 2063) by four Germans is to the god Maponos and the numen of the emperor:.

&quot;Deo / Mapono / et n(umini) Aug(usti) / Durio / et Ramio / et Trupo / et Lurio / Germa/ni v(otum) s(olverunt) l(ibentes) m(erito)&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;To the god Maponos and to the Numen of Augustus, the Germani Durio, Ramio, Trupo and Lurio have fulfilled their vow willingly, as is deserved.&quot;

This inscription (RIB 583) by a unit of Sarmatians based at Ribchester shows the association with Apollo and also can be precisely dated to the day (&quot;pridie Kalendas Septembres&quot;, or 29 August in the Roman calendar) and the year (241 CE, by mention of the two consuls).

:&quot;Deo san(cto) / [A]pollini Mapono / [pr]o salute d(omini) n(ostri) / [et] n(umeri) eq(uitum) Sar/[m(atarum)] Bremetenn(acensium) / [G]ordiani / [A]el(ius) Antoni/nus |(centurio) leg(ionis) VI / vic(tricis) domo / Melitenis / praep(ositus) et pr(aefectus) / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito) / [de]dic(atum) pr(idie) Kal(endas) Sep(tembres) / [Im]p(eratore) d(omino) n(ostro) Gord[i]/[ano A]ug(usto) II e[t] Pon[peia]no(!) co(n)s(ulibus)&quot;

The preceding inscriptions are all in Latin. The name is also found on the inscription from Chamalières, which is a relatively long magical text (12 lines) written in Gaulish on a rolled lead sheet. The second line calls for the help of Maponos (here in the accusative singular, Maponon: &quot;artiu maponon aruerriíatin&quot; (RIG L-100).

===Iconography===
There are at least three statues to Maponos. In one, he is depicted as a harper and stands opposite a Celtic Diana huntress figure. A sketch of this image appears in Ann Ross&#x27; &quot;Pagan Celtic Britain&quot;.

===Toponymy===
Two items of place-name evidence also attest to Maponos in Britain. Both are from the 7th-century Ravenna Cosmography. &quot;Locus Maponi&quot; (Richmond &amp; Crawford #228) or &quot;the place of Maponos&quot;, is thought to be between Lochmaben and Lockerbie (the name Lochmaben may be derived from Locus Maponi, with the &quot;p&quot; to &quot;b&quot; sound shift). &quot;Maporiton&quot; (Richmond &amp; Crawford #163) or &quot;the ford of Maponos&quot; is thought to be Ladyward, near Lockerbie. The Lochmaben Stone lies near Gretna on the farm named Old Graitney, the old name for Gretna. The name Clachmaben, meaning &#x27;stone of Maben or Maponos&#x27;, has become corrupted to Lochmaben. This stone was probably part of a stone circle and the area is thought to have been a centre for the worship of Maponus. An inscription from Birrens in Scotland (RIB-3, 3482 / AE 1968, 254) mentions a &quot;lo(cus) Mabomi&quot;, which is often regarded as a stone-cutter&#x27;s error for &quot;locus *Maponi&quot;.

===Coligny Calendar===
The fifteenth day of Riuros on the Coligny calendar is marked with the name Mapanos, which might be a reference to a festival for Maponos.

==Celtic epithets of Apollo==
In Britain, dedications to Apollo have been found with the following epithets: 
* &quot;Apollo Anextiomarus&quot;
* &quot;Apollo Anicetus Sol&quot;
* &quot;Apollo Grannus&quot;
* &quot;Apollo Maponus&quot; (shows a Latinising influence, &quot;-os&quot; becoming &quot;-us&quot;). 
It can thus be difficult to tell from a simple dedication to Apollo whether the classical deity is meant or whether a particular Celtic deity is being referred to under a classical name. The situation in Gaul is even more complicated, with at least twenty epithets being recorded. (Jufer &amp; Luginbühl pp. 94–96).

==Later tradition==

===Welsh mythology===
Maponos surfaces in the Middle Welsh narrative, the Mabinogion, as Mabon, son of Modron (a similar character in Welsh literature is Mabon son of Mellt, who may in fact be the same as Mabon son of Modron), who is herself the continuation of Gaulish Matrona (“Matronly Spirit”). The theme of Maponos son of Matrona (literally, &quot;child of mother&quot;) and the development of names in the Mabinogi from Common Brythonic and Gaulish theonyms has been examined by Hamp (1999), Lambert (1979), and Meid (1991). Mabon apparently features in the tale of a newborn child taken from his mother at the age of three nights, and is explicitly named in the story of &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;.

===Irish mythology===
His counterpart in Irish mythology would seem to be Mac(c) ind Ó‘c (Hamp 1999) (“Young Son”, “Young Lad”), an epithet of Angus or Oengus, the eternally youthful spirit to be found in Newgrange called Bruigh na Bóinne, a pre-Celtic Neolithic barrow or chambered tomb. Irish mythology portrays him as the son of the Dagda, a king of the Irish gods, and of Boann, a personification of the River Boyne. In Irish mythology, the Macc Óc frequently features as a trickster and a lover.

<text>The Matres (Latin for &quot;mothers&quot;) and Matronae (Latin for &quot;matrons&quot;) were female deities venerated in Northwestern Europe, of whom relics are found dating from the first to the fifth century AD. They are depicted on votive offerings and altars that bear images of goddesses, depicted almost entirely in groups of three, that feature inscriptions (about half of which feature Continental Celtic names and half of which feature Germanic names) and were venerated in regions of Germania, Eastern Gaul, and Northern Italy (with a small distribution elsewhere) that were occupied by the Roman army from the first to the fifth century.

Matres also appear on votive reliefs and inscriptions in other areas occupied by the Roman army, including southeast Gaul, as at Vertillum; in Spain and Portugal, where some twenty inscriptions are known, among them several ones that include local epithets such as a dedication to the &quot;Matribus Gallaicis&quot; &quot;to the Galician Mothers&quot;; and also in the Romano-Celtic culture of Pannonia in the form of similar reliefs and inscriptions to the &quot;Nutrices Augustae&quot;, &quot;the august Nurses&quot; found in Roman sites of Ptuj, Lower Styria.

== Motifs ==
Matres and Matronae appear depicted on both stones with inscriptions and without, both as altars and votives. All depictions are frontal; they appear almost exclusively in threes with at least one figure holding a basket of fruit in her lap and the women are either standing or sitting. In some depictions, the middle figure is depicted with loose hair and wearing a headband and the other two wear head dresses. In addition, snakes, children, and diapers appear. Other motifs include depictions of sacrifice—including burning incense, pigs, bowls filled with fruit—and decorations of fruits, plants, and trees. In most cases, the votive stones and altars are not found singularly, but rather in groups around temple buildings and cult centers.

== Function ==
The motif of triple goddesses was widespread in ancient Europe; compare the Fates (including Moirai, Parcae, and Norns), the Erinyes, the Charites, the Morrígan, the Horae, and other such figures, including the Tridevi of Hinduism.

Rudolf Simek suggests that the loose hair may point to maidenhood whereas the head dresses may refer to married women, the snakes may refer to an association with the souls of the dead or the underworld, and the children and diapers seem to suggest that the Matres and Matronae held a protective function over the family as well as a particular function as midwives.

=== Veneration ===
Information about the religious practices surrounding the Matres is limited to the stones on which their depictions and inscriptions are found, of which more than 1,100 exist.

Motifs include depictions of sacrifice—including burning incense, pigs, bowls filled with fruit—and decorations of fruits, plants, and trees. In most cases, the votive stones and altars are not found singularly, but rather in groups around temple buildings and cult centers.

<text>Quercus muehlenbergii, the chinquapin (or chinkapin) oak, is a deciduous species of tree in the white oak group (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Quercus&quot;). The species was often called &quot;Quercus acuminata&quot; in older literature. &quot;Quercus muehlenbergii&quot; (often misspelled as &quot;muhlenbergii&quot;) is native to eastern and central North America. It ranges from Vermont to Minnesota, south to the Florida panhandle, and west to New Mexico in the United States. In Canada it is only found in southern Ontario, and in Mexico it ranges from Coahuila south to Hidalgo.

==Description==
Chinquapin oak is monoecious in flowering habit; flowers emerge in April to late May or early June. The staminate flowers are borne in catkins that develop from the leaf axils of the previous year, and the pistillate flowers develop from the axils of the current year&#x27;s leaves. The fruit, an acorn or nut, is borne singly or in pairs, matures in one year, and ripens in September or October. About half of the acorn is enclosed in a thin cup and is chestnut brown to nearly black.

Chinquapin oak is closely related to the smaller but generally similar dwarf chinquapin oak (&quot;Quercus prinoides&quot;). Chinquapin oak is usually a tree, but occasionally shrubby, while dwarf chinquapin oak is a low-growing, clone-forming shrub. The two species generally occur in different habitats: chinquapin oak is typically found on calcareous soils and rocky slopes, while dwarf chinquapin oak is usually found on acidic substrates, primarily sand or sandy soils, and also dry shales.

Chinquapin oak is also sometimes confused with the related chestnut oak (&quot;Quercus montana&quot;), which it closely resembles. However, unlike the pointed teeth on the leaves of the chinquapin oak, chestnut oak leaves generally have rounded teeth. The two species have contrasting kinds of bark: chinquapin oak has a gray, flaky bark very similar to that of white oak (&quot;Q. alba&quot;) but with a more yellow-brown cast to it (hence the occasional name yellow oak for this species), while chestnut oak has dark, solid, deeply ridged bark. The chinquapin oak also has smaller acorns than the chestnut oak or another similar species, the swamp chestnut oak (&quot;Q. michauxii&quot;), which have some of the largest acorns of any oaks.

Key characteristics of &quot;Quercus muehlenbergii&quot; include:

*Leaf base is typically rounded
*Veins and sinuses are regular
*Acorns with no stalks or with short stalks less than 8 mm long. The acorns turn chestnut brown in the fall
*The leaves have sharp teeth but no bristles, as a member of the white oak subgenus of &quot;Quercus&quot;

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Q. muehlenbergii&quot; is generally regarded as a distinct species from the similar-appearing chestnut oak (&quot;Q. montana&quot;). The tree&#x27;s scientific name honors Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg (1753–1815), a Lutheran pastor and amateur botanist in Pennsylvania. In publishing the name &quot;Quercus mühlenbergii&quot;, German-American botanist George Engelmann mistakenly used an umlaut in spelling Muhlenberg&#x27;s name, even though Pennsylvania-born Muhlenberg himself did not use an umlaut in his name. Under the modern rules of botanical nomenclature, umlauts are transliterated, with &quot;ü&quot; becoming &quot;ue&quot;, hence Engelmann&#x27;s &quot;Quercus mühlenbergii&quot; is now presented as &quot;Quercus muehlenbergii&quot;. In lack of evidence that Engelmann&#x27;s use of the umlaut was an unintended error, and hence correctable, the &quot;muehlenbergii&quot; spelling is considered correct, although the more appropriate orthographic variant &quot;Quercus muhlenbergii&quot; is often seen.

The low-growing, cloning &quot;Q. prinoides&quot; (dwarf chinquapin oak) is similar to &quot;Q. muehlenbergii&quot; and has been confused with it in the past, but is now generally accepted as a distinct species. If the two are considered to be conspecific, the earlier-published name &quot;Quercus prinoides&quot; has priority over &quot;Q. muehlenbergii&quot;, and the larger chinquapin oak can then be classified as &quot;Quercus prinoides &quot;var.&quot; acuminata&quot;, with the dwarf chinquapin oak being &quot;Quercus prinoides &quot;var.&quot; prinoides&quot;. &quot;Q. prinoides&quot; was named and described by the German botanist Karl (Carl) Ludwig Willdenow in 1801, in a German journal article by Muhlenberg.

==Ecology==

===Soil and topography===
Chinquapin oak is generally found on well-drained upland soils derived from limestone or where limestone outcrops occur. Occasionally it is found on well-drained limestone soils along streams. Chinquapin oak is generally found on soils that are weakly acid (pH about 6.5) to alkaline (above pH 7.0). It grows on both northerly and southerly aspects but is more common on the warmer southerly aspects. It is absent or rare at high elevations in the Appalachians.

===Associated cover===
It is rarely a predominant tree, but it grows in association with many other species. It is a component of the forest cover type White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 52) and the Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40) (2).

It grows in association with white oak &quot;(Quercus alba),&quot; black oak (&quot;Q. velutina&quot;), northern red oak (&quot;Q. rubra&quot;), scarlet oak (&quot;Q. coccinea&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), red maple (&quot;A. rubrum&quot;), hickories (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.), black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), cucumbertree (&quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot;), white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;), American basswood (&quot;Tilia americana&quot;), black walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;), butternut (&quot;J. cinerea&quot;), and yellow-poplar (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;). American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;), pitch pine (&quot;P. rigida&quot;), Virginia pine (&quot;P. virginiana&quot;), Ozark chinquapin (&quot;Castanea ozarkensis&quot;), eastern red cedar (&quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot;), bluejack oak (&quot;Quercus incana&quot;), southern red oak (&quot;Q. falcata&quot;), blackgum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), and winged elm (&quot;Ulmus alata&quot;) also grow in association with chinquapin oak. In the Missouri Ozarks a redcedar-chinquapin oak association has been described.

The most common small tree and shrub species found in association with chinquapin oak include flowering dogwood &quot;(Cornus ),&quot; sassafras (&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;), sourwood (&quot;Oxydendrum arboreum&quot;), eastern hophornbeam (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;), &quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp., &quot;Viburnum&quot; spp., hawthorns &quot;(Crataegus&quot; spp.), and sumacs (&quot;Rhus&quot; spp.). The most common woody vines are wild grape (&quot;Vitis&quot; spp.) and greenbrier &quot;(Smilax&quot; spp.).

===Reaction to competition===
Chinquapin oak is classified as intolerant of shade. It withstands moderate shading when young but becomes more intolerant of shade with age. It is regarded as a climax species on dry, drought prone soils, especially those of limestone origin. On more moist sites it is subclimax to climax. It is often found as a component of the climax vegetation in stands on mesic sites with limestone soils. However, many oak-hickory stands on moist sites that contain chinquapin oak are succeeded by a climax forest including beech, maple, and ash.

=== Diseases and pests ===
Severe wildfire kills chinquapin oak saplings and small pole-size trees, but these often resprout. However, fire scars serve as entry points for decay-causing fungi, and the resulting decay can cause serious losses.

Oak wilt (&quot;Bretziella fagacearum&quot;), a vascular disease, attacks chinquapin oak and usually kills the tree within two to four years. Other diseases that attack chinquapin oak include the cankers &quot;Strumella coryneoidea&quot; and &quot;Nectria galligena&quot;, shoestring root rot (&quot;Armillarea mellea&quot;), anthracnose (&quot;Gnomonia veneta&quot;), and leaf blister (&quot;Taphrina&quot; spp.).

The most serious defoliating insects that attack chinquapin oak are the gypsy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;), the orangestriped oakworm (&quot;Anisota senatoria&quot;), and the variable oakleaf caterpillar (&quot;Heterocampa manteo&quot;). Insects that bore into the bole and seriously degrade the products cut from infested trees include the carpenterworm (&quot;Prionoyxstus robiniae&quot;), little carpenterworm (&quot;P. macmurtrei&quot;), white oak borer (&quot;Goes tigrinus&quot;), Columbian timber beetle (&quot;Corthylus columbianus&quot;), oak timberworm (&quot;Arrhenodes minutus&quot;), and twolined chestnut borer (&quot;Agrilus bilineatus&quot;). The acorn weevils (&quot;Curculio&quot; spp.), larvae of moths (&quot;Valentinia glandulella&quot; and &quot;Melissopus latiferreanus&quot;), and gall forming cynipids (&quot;Callirhytis&quot; spp.) feed on the acorns.

==Uses==

Like that of other white oak species, the wood of the chinquapin oak is a durable hardwood prized for many types of construction.

The chinquapin oak is especially known for its sweet and palatable acorns. The nuts contained inside of the thin shell are among the sweetest of any oak, with an excellent taste even when eaten raw, providing an excellent source of food for both wildlife and people. The acorns are eaten by squirrels, mice, voles, chipmunks, deer, turkey, and other birds.

<text>In Celtic mythology, Nantosuelta is the goddess of nature, the earth, fire, and fertility.

A 1948 article suggests that there is an uncanny resemblance between Nantosuelta and what we know of the Irish goddess The Morrígan, who was associated with death and war. The two are compared and the authors suggest that Nantosuelta was cognate to the Irish Morrígan. This theory is not widely held or found in more recent scholarship on the subject.

The Mediomatrici (Alsace, Lorraine) depicted her in art as holding a round house on a pole and with a crow. Other likely depictions show her with a pot or bee hive. Nantosuelta&#x27;s round house may have symbolized abundance. It was believed that Nantosuelta transformed into a crow on the battlefield, which was an appropriate transformation for the goddess or may have been a metaphor for her ability to powerfully navigate a battlefield.

Nantosuelta is often associated with water and depicted as being surrounded by water. The goddess&#x27;s name literally translates as &#x27;of winding stream&#x27; or &#x27;sun-drenched valley&#x27;. 
Nantosuelta is attested by statues and by inscriptions.

== Depictions ==

In this relief from Sarrebourg, near Metz, Nantosuelta, wearing a long gown is standing to the left. In her left hand she holds a small house-shaped object with two circular holes and a peaked roof. Her right hand holds a patera that she is tipping onto a cylindrical altar. 
To the right Sucellus stands, bearded, in a tunic with a cloak on his right shoulder. He holds his mallet in his right hand and an olla in his left. 
Above the figures is a dedicatory inscription and below them in very low relief is a raven. This sculpture was dated by Reinach, from the form of the letters, to the end of the first century or start of the second century.

An altar from Metz has a carving of a woman with similar dress to the Sarrebourg example, also holding a small house on a pole, thus presumed to be Nantosuelta. Sucellus is not shown on that example.

A stone representing Sucellus and Nantosuelta from a cemetery near ancient Margidunum near Nottinghamshire in addition to a votive relief of Sucellus from Margidunum, combined with an abbreviated &quot;M.&quot; at the end of the Sarrebourg inscription led scholars to conjecture that the abbreviated &quot;M.&quot; may suggest Margi as an epithet of Nantosuelta. The abbreviation has been suggested as an attempt by the artisan to avoid invoking the name of death directly.

Since she appears paired with deity Sucellos in epigraphy, they are interpreted as consorts.

== Inscriptions ==
The inscription on the Sarrebourg altar reads:
:&quot;Deo Svcello /&quot;
:&quot;Nantosvelte /&quot;
:&quot;Bellavsvs Mas /&quot;
:&quot;se filivs v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
:&quot;To the god Sucellus and to Nantosuelta, Bellausus, son of Massa, willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot;

The inscription on the Metz altar says:
:&quot;In h(onorem) {r} d(omus) d(ivinae) / &quot;
:&quot;M(arcus) Tignuarius / &quot;
:&quot;v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)&quot;
:&quot;In honour of the divine house, Marcus Tignuarius willingly and deservedly fulfilled his vow.&quot;

Here the dedication is to the Imperial house, and Nantosuelta is not explicitly mentioned. The visual depiction makes the identification secure.

== Etymology ==
According to Ranko Matasovic, the particle &quot;*nanto-&quot; means &#x27;stream, valley&#x27;.

A section of scholars translate the second part, &quot;-suelta&quot;, as related to the Sun. Roux in 1952, Olmstead in 1994, and Polomé in 1997 maintained that the proto-Indo-European root, &quot;*swel-&quot; &#x27;swelter&#x27;, found in Indo-European words denoting &#x27;sun&#x27;, was inherited into Gaulish. Thus, Xavier Delamarre asserts that the name means &#x27;sun-warmed valley&#x27;.

Academic Miranda Aldhouse-Green interprets her name as &#x27;winding river&#x27;.

<text>Deus Nemausus is often said to have been the Celtic patron god of Nemausus (Nîmes). The god does not seem to have been worshipped outside this locality. The city certainly derives its name from Nemausus, which was perhaps the sacred wood in which the Celtic tribe of the Volcae Arecomici (who of their own accord surrendered to the Romans in 121 BC) held their assemblies. Or perhaps it was the local Celtic spirit guardian of the spring that originally provided all water for the settlement, as many modern sources suggest. Or perhaps Stephanus of Byzantium was correct in stating in his geographical dictionary that Nemausos, the city of Gaul, took its name from the Heracleid (or son of Heracles) Nemausios.

An important healing-spring sanctuary existed in the town; it was established in some form at least as early as the early Iron Age but was expanded after the Romans colonised the region in the late 2nd century BC, when there was active Roman encouragement of the cult. Another set of local spirits worshiped at Nemausus (Nîmes) were the Nemausicae or Matres Nemausicae, who were fertility and healing goddesses belonging to the spring sanctuary.

<text>Nemetona, or &#x27;she of the sacred grove&#x27;, is a Celtic goddess with roots in northeastern Gaul. She is thought to have been the eponymous deity of the Germano-Celtic people known as the Nemetes; evidence of her veneration is found in their former territory along the Middle Rhine as well in the Altbachtal sanctuary in present-day Trier, Germany. She is also attested in Bath, England, where an altar to her was dedicated by a man of the Gallic Treveri people.

== Etymology ==
Nemetona&#x27;s name is derived from the Celtic root &quot;nemeto-&quot;, referring to consecrated religious spaces, particularly sacred groves. She has been considered a guardian goddess of open-air places of worship. The same root is found in the names of the Romano-British goddess Arnemetia and the Matres Nemetiales (known from an inscription in Grenoble).

== Inscriptions ==
Surviving inscriptions often associate Nemetona with Mars (sometimes given the Celtic name Loucetius). She is paired with &quot;Loucetius Mars&quot; in the inscription at Bath, and with &quot;Mars&quot; at Trier and Altrip. Separate inscriptions to Nemetona and to Loucetius have been recovered from the same site in Klein-Winternheim near Mainz. The Altrip site was further notable for yielding a terra cotta depiction of the goddess.

One inscription from Eisenberg appears to identify Nemetona with Victoria:
:&quot;[In h(onorem) d(omus)] d(ivinae) Marti Lou/[cetio et] Victoriae Neme/[tonae] M(arcus) A(urelius) Senillus Seve/[rus b(ene)f(iciarius) l]egati urnam cum / [sortib]us et phiala(m) ex / [vo]to posuit l(ibens) l(aetus) m(erito) / [Grat]o et Seleuco co(n)s(ulibus) / X Kal(endas) Maias&quot;
:&quot;In honour of the divine house, to Mars Loucetius and Victoria Nemetona, Marcus Aurelius Senillus Severus, a protégé of the general, set up an urn with its lots and serving-dish in free, cheerful, and well-deserved fulfilment of his vow on the tenth day before the Kalends of May in the consulship of Gratus and Seleucus (22 April 221).&quot;

Noémie Beck considers the identification of Nemetona with Nemain to be &quot;inaccurate and irrelevant&quot;.

<text>Niamh (, also known as Niamh Cinn-Óir (&quot;Golden-headed Niamh&quot; or &quot;Golden-haired Niamh&quot;) is the lover or spouse of Oisín, son of Fionn mac Cumhail, in the Fianna Cycle of Irish mythology.

In the story of Niamh, she was an otherworldly woman who fell in love with an Irish man named Oisín and carried him away to live with her in her domain of Tír na nÓg, the Land of Youth. She had two sons and a daughter with Oisín. After more than 300 years of living together, Niamh reluctantly allowed Oisín to visit Ireland, imposing on him a taboo not to touch the ground there, and once he did, he turned old and was unable to go back to see Niamh ever again.

In the medieval version, Niamh was a mortal princess of Munster who eloped with Oisín to Ulster but committed suicide when her father&#x27;s army arrived in pursuit.

==Summary==
The familiar story of Niamh of Tír na nÓg was described in a poem around 1750 attributed to Mícheál Coimín (1676–1760), and summarized as follows:

:Niamh came from beyond the sea westwards, riding a white steed, and found the Fianna on a deer hunt near Loch Léin (in County Kerry).

:She identified herself as Niamh the Golden-headed, daughter of the King of the Land of Youth, and declared her love for Oisín son of Finn. She intended to take him to the Land of Youth (Tír na nÓg), and described the promises it held.

:Oisín, already in love, consented to the proposition and the two rode off together on the white steed. When they witnessed the maiden of the Land of the Living (Tír na mBeo) being violently pursued by a giant (Fomhor Builleach of Dromloghach), they made a detour to the Land of Virtues, where Oisín championed the maiden and slew the giant.

:Niamh and Oisín reached the Land of Youth, met the king and queen, and were married. The couple had three children (two sons they named Oscar and Finn, and the girl Plor na mBan &quot;Flower of Women&quot;). When he had spent 300 years or more, Oisín developed homesickness and wished to see his father and the Fianna back in Ireland. (It is reckoned that the 300 years only seemed like 3 years to him, in some retold versions).

:Niamh reluctantly agreed to let Oisín visit his home, allowing him to ride Embarr, her white steed, but she cautioned him not to touch Irish soil, warning that if he did, he would be unable to return. She feared the worst outcome. She told him the trip would be for naught since the Fianna were long gone from Ireland, and Christians now inhabited the land. Oisín returned to Ireland, and searched for the Fianna in vain. At a place called Gleann-an-Smoil (glen of the thrushes), Oisín was asked to help lift a marble flagstone, as the men holding it up underneath were being overcome by the weight. Oisín moved the stone, but in the effort, the horse&#x27;s belt broke and he fell to ground, turning him into a feeble and blind old man. The horse fled.

This entire story of Niamh is told within the frame story of Oisín&#x27;s dialogue with Saint Patrick.

== Modern text ==
The only Irish text preserved from the past which contains the story of Oisín and Niamh in Tír na nÓg is the poem &quot;Laoi&quot;[&quot;ḋ&quot;] &quot;Oisín A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;]&quot;r Ṫír Na N-Óg&quot; &quot;The Lay of Oisin in the Land of the Youth&quot;, composed around 1750 and attributed to Mícheál Coimín (Michael Comyn, 1676–1760). The poem may have been based on lost traditional material, although the opposite may be true, and the poet may have largely invented the story working from very basic hints about Oisin and Caílte&#x27;s journeys to the fairy mounds (&quot;sídhe&quot;), as described in the &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;. It has even been suggested that the folktale the poet borrowed from may not necessarily be Irish, since foreign tales of the same theme are numerous and widespread.

The story of Oisín&#x27;s disappearance to Niamh&#x27;s fairyland is regarded as one of several tales told to explain why Oisín was not killed in the Battle of Gabhra in which the Fianna were annihilated, and how he lived to tell his tale many centuries later.

==Medieval version==
In the oldest text, Niamh, daughter of Aengus Tírech, king of Munster, eloped with Oisín to Ulster, spending six weeks there, until the king arrived in pursuit with a great host. She thereby killed herself by burying her face in the ground, alongside thirty women. The spot was named the Well of the Women (&quot;tipra an bhantrachta&quot;), and it was on the edge of the Lake of the Red Stag (&quot;loch and daimh dheirg&quot;). The account is given in the &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;.

<text>The Enbarr (Énbarr) or Aonbharr of Manannán () is a horse in the Irish Mythological Cycle which could traverse both land and sea, and was swifter than wind-speed.

The horse was the property of the sea-god Manannan mac Lir, but provided to Lugh Lamh-fada () to use at his disposal. In the story &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot; (&quot;The Fate of the Children of Tuireann&quot;), Lugh refused to lend it to the sons of Tuireann, but was then forced to lend the self-navigating boat &quot;Sguaba Tuinne&quot; (Wave-sweeper) instead.

==Forms==
Aenbharr or Aonbharr () occur in &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot;.

In P.W. Joyce&#x27;s retelling the horse is also called Enbarr of the Flowing Mane. The forms Énbarr, Enbhárr are given by James Mackillop&#x27;s dictionary.

==Etymology==
The meaning of this name has been variously defined. As a common noun &quot;enbarr&quot; is glossed as &quot;froth&quot; in the medieval Cormac&#x27;s glossary.

The modern Irish form Aonbharr is glossed as &quot;One Mane&quot; by O&#x27;Curry, &quot;the one or unrivalled mane&quot; by O&#x27;Curry and O&#x27;Duffy, and &quot;unique supremacy&quot; by James Mackillop&#x27;s dictionary.

Welsh scholar John Rhys thought the name meant &quot;she had a bird&#x27;s head&quot;, and evidently considered it a mare.

==In romance==
In the romance &quot;Oidheadh Chlainne Tuireann&quot; (OCT, The Fate of the Children of Tuireann), the Tuatha Dé Danann oppressed by tribute enforced by the Formorians gather an assembly on a hill, and Lugh arrives among an army of the &quot;Fairy Cavalcade from the Land of Promise&quot; (). Aonbharr of Manannán was the horse Lugh was riding. The horse was quicker than the &quot;naked cold wind of spring&quot;, and could travel over land or sea with equal ease. It also had the property that whoever was mounted on its back could not be killed. And Lugh was dressed in various armor from the sea-god adding to his invulnerability. Note that in P. W. Joyce&#x27;s retelling the fairy cavalcade appeared as &quot;warriors, all mounted on white steeds&quot;, which suggests as embellishment that Lugh&#x27;s horse was white also.

Lugh refused to loan the horse to the sons of Tuireann, claiming that would be the loan of a loan, but in making this refusal, was later trapped into lending the self-navigating &quot;currach&quot; (coracle boat) called the &quot;Besom of the Sea&quot; (), also called Sguaba Tuinne or Wave-sweeper.

== In popular culture ==
Enbarr appears in the 2013 video game, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;. Enbarr can be obtained through the extreme level on The Whorleater, as a random drop.

Enbarr appears as a minor character in the Nate Temple series by Shayne Silvers. He is the horse of Manannán mac Lir and is responsible for removing the main character, Quinn MacKenna, from the Otherworld and taking her to Fae.

Enbarr is the namesake of Enbarr Ltd, an Irish startup company that developed equine health management software, StablePro.

In the 2019 video game &quot;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&quot;, &quot;Enbarr&quot; is the name of the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire.

<text>*&quot;Nodens or*&quot;Nodons (reconstructed from the dative &quot;Nodenti&quot; or &quot;Nodonti&quot;) is a Celtic healing god worshipped in Ancient Britain. Although no physical depiction of him has survived, votive plaques found in a shrine at Lydney Park (Gloucestershire) indicate his connection with dogs, a beast associated with healing symbolism in antiquity. The deity is known in only one other location, in Cockersand Moss (Lancashire). He was equated on most inscriptions with the Roman god Mars (as a healer rather than as a warrior) and associated in a curse with Silvanus (a hunting-god). His name is cognate with that of later Celtic mythological figures, such as the Irish &quot;Nuada&quot; and the Welsh &quot;Nudd&quot;.

The philologist and author J. R. R. Tolkien was invited to investigate the Latin inscription, and scholars have noted several likely influences on his Middle-earth fantasy writings, including the Elvish smith, maker of Rings of Power, Celebrimbor, whose name, like that of Nuada&#x27;s epithet &quot;Airgetlám&quot;, means &#x27;Silver-hand&#x27;. Nodens appears, too, in the works of Arthur Machen, as well as H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos.

==Name and origin==
The theonym *&quot;Nodens&quot; or *&quot;Nodons&quot; is reconstructed from the attested dative singular &quot;Nodenti&quot; or &quot;Nodonti&quot;, which is derived from a Proto-Celtic stem &quot;*Nowdont-.&quot; It is a cognate (linguistic sibling from the same origin) of the Middle Irish &quot;Nuadu&quot; and the Middle Welsh &quot;Nudd&quot; (which turned into &quot;Lludd&quot;, apparently from an alliterative assimilation). The Irish genitives &quot;nodot&quot; and &quot;núada(i)t&quot; (perhaps &#x27;hand, wrist or arm&#x27;) also appear to be related. It suggests that &quot;Nōdonti&quot; was the original form, by showing the back vocalism of the Celtic suffix &quot;-ont&quot;-. The development from &quot;-ō-&quot; to &quot;-ū-&quot; in Brittonic languages dates back to the end of the 3rd century AD. An Old Breton name &quot;Nodent&quot; (modern &quot;Nuz&quot;) may also be added to the cognates, although the vocalism raises phonological difficulties.

The origin of the name remains obscure, scholar John Carey noting that &quot;it seems at any rate safe to say that no etymology so far proposed can be accepted with full confidence&quot;. The Welsh noun &quot;nudd&quot; means &#x27;mist, haze, fog&#x27;, and both &quot;Lludd&quot; and &quot;Nuadu&quot; are attached to the epithet &#x27;[of the] silver hand/arm&#x27;, which could lead to a conjectural Proto-Celtic stem *&quot;snowdo-&quot; (&#x27;mist, haze&#x27;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;snewdh&quot;- (&#x27;mist, cloud&#x27;; cf. Latin &quot;nūbēs&quot; &#x27;clouds&#x27;), perhaps also attested in the Irish &quot;snuad&quot; (&#x27;appearance, colour&#x27;). However, the sound shift &quot;sn&quot;- &gt; &quot;n&quot;- does not seem to be attested elsewhere in Gaulish (although -&quot;sn&quot;- &gt; -&quot;n&quot;- is known) and remains difficult to justify in Proto-Brittonic (the sound change should have occurred later than the inscriptions). Scholars have also linked the Celtic names with the stem *&quot;néud-&quot; (cf. Gothic &quot;niutan&quot; &#x27;to catch, attain, acquire&#x27; and &quot;nuta&quot; &#x27;catcher, fisherman&#x27;, Lithuanian &quot;naudà&quot; &#x27;property&#x27;), associating &quot;*Nowdont-&quot; with the fishing (and possibly hunting) motifs of the Lydney remains and with the silver arms of Nuadu and Lludd. However, this stem remains unattested elsewhere in Celtic, and possibly takes its origins from a pre-Indo-European language. A third alternative is the Proto-Indo-European stem *&quot;neh2u&quot;-&quot;t-&quot; (cf. Goth. &quot;nauþs&quot; &#x27;need, compulsion, distress&#x27;, Old Prussian &quot;nautin&quot; &#x27;need&#x27;), which could be found in Proto-Celtic *&quot;nāwito&quot;- (&#x27;need&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;neóit&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;neued&quot;), although linguist Ranko Matasović finds the relation &quot;formally quite difficult&quot; to explain.

Nudd&#x27;s son &quot;Gwyn&quot; (ruler of the Welsh Otherworld), his name meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, is an exact cognate of the Irish name &quot;Finn&quot;, who is described as the great-grandson of Nuadu mac Achi (Finn mac Umaill) or Nuadu Necht (Finn File). Although the origin of the association remains difficult to explain, Carey writes that Nodons may be seen &quot;a god of multi-faceted but consistent character: a shining royal warrior presiding over the chaotic in nature, society and the Otherworld (water, war, the devils of Annwn).&quot; In this view, the Middle Irish &quot;núada&quot;, &quot;núadu&quot; (&#x27;hero, champion, king [poetic]?&#x27;) may be interpreted as the euhemerized name of the Celtic deity, with a semantic shift comparable to that conjectured for Proto-Germanic &quot;*balþaz&quot; &gt; &quot;*Balðraz&quot; (&#x27;white, shining&#x27; &gt; &#x27;strong, brave, bold&#x27; &gt; &#x27;hero, prince&#x27;; cf. Old Norse &quot;Baldr&quot; &#x27;brave, defiant, lord, prince&#x27; and Old English &quot;Bældæg&quot; &#x27;shining day&#x27;).

According to Arthur Bernard Cook (1906) the toponym &quot;Lydney&quot; derives from the Old English *&quot;Lydan-eġ&quot;, &quot;Lludd&#x27;s Island&quot;, which could connect it with Nodens. However, alternative etymologies of Lydney are offered in other sources. A. D. Mills suggests &quot;island or river-meadow of the sailor, or of a man named *Lida&quot;, citing the forms &quot;Lideneg&quot; from c. 853 and &quot;Ledenei&quot; from the 1086 Domesday Book.

== Inscriptions ==

=== Lydney Park complex ===
The temple complex at Lydney Park, situated on a steep bluff overlooking the Severn Estuary, is rectangular, measuring with a central cella measuring and its north-western end is divided into three chambers 6.3 m deep. This imposing, Romano-Celtic temple building has been interpreted as an &quot;incubatio&quot; or dormitory for sick pilgrims to sleep and experience a vision of divine presence in their dreams. The site may have been chosen because it offered a clear view of the River Severn near the point at which the Severn Bore begins. Its position within an earlier Iron Age hill fort may also be relevant.

The temple complex was first excavated by Charles Bathurst in 1805, then reexcavated in 1928–1929 by Sir Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler, who produced an extensive report of the findings at the site. Although no anthropomorphic depiction of the deity has been discovered, a dozen figures of dogs were found at the site, presumably deposited at the shrine as offerings by pilgrims due to the healing symbolism associated with dogs. As one of these figurines has a human face, it is possible that the deity himself could have been perceived as taking the form of an animal. A bronze arm whose hand displays the spoon-shaped fingernails characteristic of someone suffering from iron deficiency gives further evidence of the healing attributes of Nodens. Findings at the site include bronze reliefs depicting a sea deity, fishermen and tritons, a bronze plaque of a woman, about 320 pins, nearly 300 bracelets, and over 8,000 coins. Also present were oculists&#x27; stamps used to mark sticks of eye ointment, like those at Gallo-Roman healing sanctuaries in antiquity. The deity was further associated with aquatic and solar imagery, similar to other curative shrines of Roman Gaul.

Several inscriptions to Nodens have been found, one on a lead curse tablet reading:

Other inscriptions identify Nodens, in various spellings, with the Roman god Mars:

=== Cockersand Moss ===
A silver statuette, discovered at Cockersand Moss (Lancashire) in 1718 and now lost, had an inscription on its base that reads:

Another reads:

== Mythological parallels ==
Nuada Airgetlám was the first king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who was disqualified from kingship after losing his hand (or arm) in battle, but restored after he was given a working silver one by the physician Dian Cecht and the wright Creidhne (gaining the epithet &quot;Airgetlám&quot;, &#x27;silver hand&#x27;), and later a flesh and blood one by Dian Cecht&#x27;s son Miach.

The legendary Welsh hero Nudd appears in the Triads as one of the three most generous men in Wales, along with his two cousins, Rhydderch Hael and Mordaf Hael. His two sons are known as Edern ap Nudd and Gwyn ap Nudd. Nudd may also be called &quot;Lludd&quot;, and seems to be linked to other figures of the same name, such as the son of Beli Mawr in &quot;Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== Tolkien ===


J. R. R. Tolkien, invited to investigate the Latin inscription at Lydney Park, traced Nodens to the Irish hero &quot;Nuada Airgetlám&quot;, &quot;Nuada of the Silver-Hand&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey thought this a &quot;pivotal&quot; influence on Tolkien&#x27;s invention of Middle-earth, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand. Mathew Lyons notes the &quot;Hobbit-like appearance of [Dwarf&#x27;s Hill]&#x27;s mine-shaft holes&quot;, and that Tolkien was, according to the Lydney curator Sylvia Jones, extremely interested in the hill&#x27;s folklore on his stay there. Helen Armstrong commented that the place may have inspired Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Celebrimbor and the fallen realms of Moria and Eregion&quot;. The name of the Elven-smith Celebrimbor of Eregion, who forged the Rings of Power in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, means &quot;Silver Hand&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented Elvish language of Sindarin. Dwarf&#x27;s Hill with its many mineshafts has been suggested as an influence on the Lonely Mountain in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the Mines of Moria in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== Lovecraft ===

Nodens appears as a deity in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. His appearance and action were based on a mixture of Celtic mythology, Roman mythology, and the deity&#x27;s appearance in Arthur Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Great God Pan&quot;. Nodens first appeared in Lovecraft&#x27;s 1926 novella &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;, where he is an &quot;archaic&quot; god served by the night-gaunts. He is depicted as somewhat benevolent and as opposing the frightening Nyarlathotep. Nodens appears again in Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Strange High House in the Mist&quot;, also written in 1926. When the protagonist, Thomas Olney, enters the eponymous house, he sees &quot;primal Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss&quot; riding in a large shell that is carried by dolphins.

=== Paolini ===

In Christopher Paolini&#x27;s &quot;Eragon&quot;, &#x27;Argetlam&#x27; (lit: silver hand) is another name for the &quot;gedwëy ignasia&quot; (lit: &quot;shining palm&quot; in the fictional &#x27;Ancient Language&#x27; made by Paolini for the series. It is adapted from the Irish word &quot;Airgetlam&quot;.

<text>MISTRAM (&quot;MISsile TRAjectory Measurement&quot;) was a high-resolution tracking system used by the United States Air Force (and later NASA) to provide highly detailed trajectory analysis of rocket launches.

A &quot;classic&quot; ranging system used since the 1960s uses radar to time a radio signal&#x27;s travel to a target (in this case, the rocket) and back. This technique is accurate to approximately 1%. The accuracy of this technique is limited by the need to create a sharp &quot;pulse&quot; of radio so that the start of the signal can be accurately defined. There are both practical and theoretical limits to the sharpness of the pulse. In addition, the timing of the signals often introduced inaccuracies of its own until the introduction of high precision clocks.

In MISTRAM, this was avoided by broadcasting a continuous signal. The basic system used a ground station located down range from the launch site (at Valkaria, Florida and Eleuthera Island, Bahamas) and a transponder on the vehicle. The tracking station transmitted an X-band carrier signal which the transponder responded to by re-broadcasting it on another (shifted) frequency. By slowly changing the frequency of the carrier broadcast from the station and comparing this with the phase of the signal being returned, ground control could measure the distance to the vehicle very accurately. Even with the analog circuitry used, MISTRAM was accurate to less than 1 km at the distance of the Moon.
To meet more stringent ballistic missile test requirements, several systems were designed, procured and added to the US Air Force Eastern Range&#x27;s instrumentation in the 1950s and 1960s. The AZUSA continuous wave tracking system was added to the Cape in the mid-1950s and Grand Bahama in the early 1960s. The AN/FPS-16 radar system was introduced at the Cape, Grand Bahama, San Salvador, Ascension and East Grand Bahama Island between 1958 and 1961. In the early 1960s, the MISTRAM (Missile Trajectory Measurement) system was installed at Valkaria, Florida and Eleuthera island in the Bahamas to support Minuteman missile flights.

==Principles of operation==

MISTRAM is a sophisticated interferometer system consisting of a group of five receiving stations arranged in an L shape. Baselines are . and . The central stations contains a simple tracking antenna. The distance from the central station to the furthest remote station is approximately . Antennas at the central station and the four remote stations follow the flight of a missile and receive signals from its radio beacon.

In the MISTRAM system, the ground station transmits a carrier to the spacecraft and the spacecraft returns this carrier on another frequency. The ground station sweeps the uplink carrier and the phase shift of the downlink carrier is measured (counted) while it is being swept. The round trip delay time can be shown to be T=(delta-phi)/(delta-f); where delta-f is the frequency shift (~4000 Hz for example) and delta-phi the measured phase shift in radians. Suppose T=2 sec (~lunar distance) then delta-phi=8000 radians, i.e. (8000*180)/Pi. Assume also that the phase can be measured with an accuracy of 1 deg, i.e. means that the range can be determined with a precision of (600000*1*Pi)/(2*8000*180)=0.33 km. An additional carrier quite near the one described above that remained fixed in frequency and used as a phase reference. That carrier and the two frequencies (that the sweep changed between) were generated as multiples of the same basic oscillator frequency. In this way, all signals would have a fixed phase relationship, as was done in MISTRAM. A similar technique was used in the Soviet Luna 20 spacecraft at 183.54 MHz to survey the Moon&#x27;s surface.

MISTRAM was a multistatic long baseline radar interferometer developed for precision measurements of missile trajectories at the US Air Force Eastern Test Range. Multistatic radar systems have a higher complexity with multiple transmitter and receiver subsystems employed in a coordinated manner at more than two sites. All of the geographically dispersed units contribute to the collective target acquisition, detection, position finding and resolution, with simultaneous reception at the receiver sites. In a simpler sense, multistatic radars are systems which have two or more receiving sites with a common spatial coverage area, and data from these coverage areas are combined and processed at a central location. These systems are considered to be multiple bistatic pairs. Multistatic radar systems have various uses, including prevention of jamming and anti-radar munitions.

Although this method of measurement is not new, either in theory or in practice, the unique manner in which the techniques were implemented in the MISTRAM system permit measurement of vehicle flight parameters with a degree of precision and accuracy not previously obtainable in other long baseline trajectory measurement systems. To a large extent, this was accomplished by a unique method of transferring intact the phase information in the signals from outlying stations to the central station. A two-way transmission path on each baseline was used to cancel out uncertainties due to variance in ground geometry and temperature.
The transmitter at the master or central station generates two CW X-band frequencies, nominally 8148 MHz and 7884 to 7892 MHz. The higher frequency (the range signal) is very stable, whereas the lower frequency (the calibrated signal) is swept periodically over the indicated range. The airborne transponder receives the signals, amplifies &amp; frequency shifts them by 68 MHz, and retransmits back to earth. The Doppler shift is used to determine velocity.

The Florida MISTRAM system had baselines (~18.9 mi.) with design performance as follows:


==MISTRAM transponder==

The Transponder receives the two phase-coherent X-band cw signals transmitted from the ground equipment. A klystron with a 68 MHz coherent frequency offset is phase locked to each of the received signals. These klystrons provide the phase coherent return transmission. There are two separate phase locked loops, continuous and calibrate.

==M-236 computer==

MISTRAM was used on a number of projects, including the ATLAS missile system, other large military radar projects in the 1960s, and Project Apollo, and the Air Force required a data-collection computer to be installed in a tracking station downrange from Cape Canaveral. The data would eventually be shared with the 36-bit IBM 7094 machine at the Cape, so the computer would likely have to be 36-bits as well (why they didn&#x27;t use an IBM 7094 is something of a mystery). General Electric built a machine called the M236 for the task.

According to Dr. Neelands, certain military people involved in the project were adamant about not relying on &quot;computers&quot;, therefore this &quot;information processor&quot; was developed. This high speed 36-bit minicomputer was developed by the GE Heavy Military Electronics Department (HMED) in Syracuse, New York. The M236 was designed for real-time processing in a radar-based missile flight measurement system and lacked some general purpose features, such as overlapped instruction processing, the floating point operations needed for Fortran, and operating system support features, such as base and bounds registers. The M-236 computer was developed for the US Air Force Cape Canaveral Missile Range, and installed at Eleuthera (Bahamas). The 36-bit computer word length was needed for radar tracking computations and for the required exchange of data with an IBM 7094 located at the Cape. The chief architect of the M236 was John Couleur.

The M236 being a component of a military project, rather than a general-purpose computer, conformed to the desires of Ralph J. Cordiner, Chairman &amp; CEO of General Electric from 1958 to 1963, not to go into competition with IBM by selling general-purpose computers. In addition, development expenditures would be paid for by the U.S. government. However, the GE-225, developed as a process control computer, had become a profitable general-purpose computer; GE&#x27;s 1950 business plan included development of more computer systems.

The debate in favor or against subsequent development of an M236-derived general purpose computer took more than one year and concluded finally with the victory of the M2360 project proponents in February 1963. The GE upper management was impressed by the opportunity to save the rental fees from IBM leased equipment used internally by GE (the cost of development of the new project was estimated to be offset by only one year of rentals). The other GE departments were not very impressed and were reluctant to jettison their IBM machines. The M2360 project became the GE-600 series, developed by a team led by John Couleur.

==Applications==
MISTRAM was used in the development and testing of inertial guidance system for the Minuteman ballistic missile, and subsequently was used for testing the Gemini spacecraft and the Saturn V launch system. With the decommissioning of the MISTRAM X-band interferometer at the Air Force Eastern Test Range in 1971, the flight-test community did not have a conventional ground-based range-instrumentation system better than, or comparable to, the inertial guidance systems whose performance was being assessed. This was true in the intervening years preceding GPS development and deployment.

==Minuteman Inertial Guidance System testing==
The first Minuteman missiles (MM I) were launched in the early 1960s from the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR) and were tracked with the AZUSA CW tracking system. The comparatively low quality of the AZUSA tracking data, combined with the rudimentary stage of evaluation techniques, allowed only estimation of the total error; no isolation of individual inertial measurement unit (IMU) error sources was possible.

Subsequent development of improved tracking systems, UDOP and MISTRAM, at AFETR yielded much higher quality velocity tracking profiles. During the Minuteman II flight test program, significant improvements were made in the post-flight evaluation of the IMU accuracy. The most important of these improvement was the introduction of maximum likelihood error estimation using the Kalman algorithm to filter the velocity error profile. Continued improvement of the UDOP and MISTRAM tracking systems and refinement of the evaluation techniques during the Minuteman III flight test program made it possible to gain considerable insight into NS-20A1 IMU error sources.

===Accuracy evaluation===
One of the major problems in trajectory and orbital estimation is to obtain a realistic estimate of the accuracy of the trajectory and other important parameters. In the orbital case, some of the parameters which may not be solved for are geopotential constants, survey, etc. These factors will affect the total uncertainty in the orbit and, of course, ephemeris predictions. A statistical technique was developed that performs a variance-covariance propagation to obtain accuracy estimates based on random and unmodeled errors. An example of the unmodeled error propagation in the MISTRAM system was given for the Geos B satellite.

Neelands has been called an engineers&#x27; engineer by the people who worked with him when he was with the General Electric Corporation Electronics Laboratory and Heavy Military Electronics Department (HMED) in the 1950s and early 60&#x27;s. His contributions to missile guidance and telemetry made him a key figure in the Altas Guidance and MISTRAM programs, two of HMED&#x27;s most challenging and successful efforts.

In retrospect, Neelands said he did not get his greatest satisfaction from his work on the Atlas guidance (about which he said,&quot;it was successful because of a bunch of other people who put it together and made it work&quot;). It is MISTRAM, missile tracking and measuring system, that he remembers with greater pride. &quot;Nothing could match it at the time for the complexity and precision it required,&quot; he recalls of the real-time measuring system for precisely tracking a missile&#x27;s flight. One of his colleagues remembers, &quot;In 1960 he solved the elusive problem of trajectory measurement -- of bringing together at one place for processing, the signals received from widely spaced receiving stations while overcoming inaccuracies due to the propagation anomalies in the medium connecting the stations. A related problem that Lew solved was how to do this using frequencies sufficiently high to develop the required angular measurement accuracy without measurement ambiguities and without requiring a large number of receiving stations to resolve these ambiguities.&quot; He conceived a system of unprecedented accuracy. The technical work on the Hermes A-3 rocket guidance was headed by Dr. Lewis J. Neelands and resulted in a successful system with the know-how later transferred to another ICBM guidance system known as the 8014 project and also to the highly accurate Mistram instrumentation equipment, all were based on use of a microwave interferometer. Dr. Neelands died at his home in Gainesville Florida on July 17, 2007, at the age of 91.

<text>Joseph Gilles Henri Villeneuve (; 18 January 1950 – 8 May 1982) was a Canadian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Villeneuve was runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and won six Grands Prix across six seasons.

A racing enthusiast from an early age, Villeneuve started his career in snowmobile racing across his native province of Quebec. He soon progressed to open-wheel racing, winning the regional Formula Ford championship in 1973 before graduating to Formula Atlantic, where he won two Canadian Championships in 1976 and 1977, and the American Championship in 1976. Villeneuve made his Formula One debut with McLaren at the 1977 British Grand Prix, impressing Enzo Ferrari, who signed him with Ferrari for . He made an early debut for the team at the after the departure of World Champion Niki Lauda, and was involved in a collision with Ronnie Peterson which killed two bystanders at the season-ending . Amidst struggles with Michelin&#x27;s radial tyres the following year, Villeneuve took his maiden podium in Austria before winning his home Grand Prix in Canada. He won several races in , ultimately finishing the championship runner-up to teammate Jody Scheckter by four points. Villeneuve earned widespread acclaim for his performances, including his duel with René Arnoux at the . After a winless season for Ferrari with the 312T5 in , Villeneuve took back-to-back wins at the Monaco and Spanish Grands Prix in , earning further acclaim for his defensive tactics at the latter.

During qualifying for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, Villeneuve died as the result of a collision with Jochen Mass. He achieved six wins, two pole positions, eight fastest laps and 13 podiums in Formula One. At the time of his death, Villeneuve was widely popular in the motorsport community, and has since become an iconic figure in the history of the sport. The Circuit Île Notre-Dame in Montreal was renamed the &quot;Circuit Gilles Villeneuve&quot; upon his death, home of the Canadian Grand Prix since his 1978 victory. His son, Jacques, won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in , becoming the first World Drivers&#x27; Champion from Canada. Alongside Jacques, Villeneuve is an inductee of the Canadian Motor Sports Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal and early life==
Villeneuve was born January 18, 1950, to piano-tuner Seville Villeneuve (1926–1987) and his wife Georgette (née Coupal; 1925–2008) at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu in the province of Quebec, Canada and grew up in Berthierville. In 1970 he married Joann Barthe, with whom he had two children, Jacques and Mélanie. During his early career Villeneuve took his family on the road with him in a motorhome during the racing season, a habit which he continued to some extent during his Formula One career. At the time of his death Gilles was reportedly considering divorce from Joann: he had long been having an extramarital affair with a Torontonian woman.

Villeneuve often claimed to have been born in 1952. By the time he made his debut in Formula One, he was already 27 years old and subtracted two years from his age to avoid being considered too old to find success at the highest level of motorsport. His younger brother Jacques also had a successful racing career in Formula Atlantic, Can-Am and CART. Gilles&#x27; son, also named Jacques, won the Indianapolis 500 and CART championships in 1995 and became Formula One World Champion in 1997.

==Early career==

Villeneuve started competitive driving in local drag-racing events, entering his road car, a modified 1967 Ford Mustang. He soon became bored by this and entered the Jim Russell Racing School at Circuit Mont-Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, running his own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, where he would compete for four seasons, running his own car again for one of those seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motorsport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison&#x27;s Ecurie Canada and factory March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning all but one of the races and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.

Money was an issue in Villeneuve&#x27;s early career. He was a professional racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In the first few years the bulk of his income in fact came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I&#x27;m talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility was &quot;terrible&quot;! Unless you were leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain.

==Formula One career==
After Villeneuve impressed James Hunt by beating him and several other Grand Prix stars in a non-championship Formula Atlantic race at Trois-Rivières in 1976, Hunt&#x27;s McLaren team offered Villeneuve a Formula One deal for up to five races in a third car during the 1977 season. Villeneuve made his debut at the 1977 British Grand Prix, where he qualified 9th in McLaren&#x27;s old M23, separating the regular drivers Hunt and Jochen Mass who were driving newer M26s. In the race he set fifth fastest lap and finished 11th after being delayed for two laps by a faulty temperature gauge. The British press coverage of Villeneuve&#x27;s performance was generally complimentary, including John Blunsden&#x27;s comment in &quot;The Times&quot; that &quot;Anyone seeking a future World Champion need look no further than this quietly assured young man.&quot;

Despite this, shortly after the British race McLaren&#x27;s experienced team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve &quot;was looking as though he might be a bit expensive&quot; and that Patrick Tambay, the team&#x27;s eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari&#x27;s team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of Tazio Nuvolari, the pre-war European champion. &quot;When they presented me with this &#x27;piccolo Canadese&#x27; (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let&#x27;s give him a try.&quot; Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve&#x27;s promise after a session at Ferrari&#x27;s Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of 1977, as well as the full 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: &quot;If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari...&quot;

Villeneuve&#x27;s arrival was prompted by Ferrari driver Niki Lauda quitting the team at the penultimate race of the 1977 season, the at Mosport Park near Toronto, having already clinched his second championship with the Italian team. Villeneuve retired from his home race after sliding off the track on another competitor&#x27;s oil. He also raced in the last race of that season, the at the Mount Fuji Speedway near Tokyo but retired on lap five when he tried to outbrake the Tyrrell P34 of Ronnie Peterson. The pair banged wheels causing Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari to become airborne. It landed on a group of spectators watching the race from a prohibited area, killing one spectator and a race marshal and injuring seven people. After an investigation into the incident no blame was apportioned and, although he was &quot;terribly sad&quot; at the deaths, Villeneuve did not feel responsible for them.
The 1978 season saw a succession of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin radial tyres. Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, but crashed out of the lead on lap 39. Despite calls in the Italian press for him to be replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve&#x27;s results improved. He finished second on the road at the , although he was penalised a minute for jumping the start, and ran second at the before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending , this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s Lotus stopped with engine trouble. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win the Canadian Grand Prix.
Villeneuve was joined by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the championship after winning back to back races in Long Beach and Kyalami. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve&#x27;s wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side by side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for the last half of the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, &quot;I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it&#x27;s very easy for one car to climb over another.&quot; At the a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve&#x27;s left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pit lane on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pit lane Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the , but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending , Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that &quot;I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles&#x27;s time and — I still don&#x27;t really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!&quot;

The 1980 season was sub-par for Ferrari. Villeneuve had been considered favourite for the Drivers&#x27; Championship by bookmakers in the United Kingdom, though he only scored six points in the whole campaign in the 312T5 which had only partial ground effects. Scheckter scored only two points and retired at the end of the season.

For the 1981 season, Ferrari introduced their first turbocharged engined F1 car, the 126C, which produced tremendous power but was let down by its poor handling. Villeneuve was partnered with Didier Pironi who noted that Villeneuve &quot;had a little family [at Ferrari] but he made me welcome and made me feel at home overnight ... [He] treated me as an equal in every way.&quot; Villeneuve won two races during the season. At the Villeneuve kept five quicker cars behind him for most of the race using the superior straight-line speed of his car. After an hour and 46 minutes of racing, Villeneuve led second-placed Jacques Laffite by only 0.22 seconds. Fifth-placed Elio de Angelis was only just over a second further back. Harvey Postlethwaite, who was hired by Ferrari to design the follow-on and much more successful 126C2 that won the Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1982, later commented on the 126C: &quot;That car...had literally one quarter of the downforce that, say Williams or Brabham had. It had a power advantage over the Cosworths for sure, but it also had massive throttle lag at that time. In terms of sheer ability I think Gilles was on a different plane to the other drivers. To win those races, the 1981 GPs at Monaco and Jarama — on tight circuits — was quite out of this world. I &quot;know&quot; how bad that car was.&quot; At the 1981 Canadian Grand Prix Villeneuve damaged the front wing of his Ferrari and drove for most of the race in heavy rain with the wing obscuring his view ahead. There was a risk of being disqualified but eventually the wing detached and Villeneuve drove on to finish third with the nose section of his car missing.

He was offered a deal by team owner Ron Dennis to rejoin McLaren in 1982, which he rejected because he was nervous over ending his contract with Ferrari but optimistic that the Italian team would be competitive. The first few races of the 1982 season saw Villeneuve leading in Brazil in the new 126C2, before spinning into retirement, and finishing third at the United States Grand Prix West before being disqualified for a technical infringement. The Ferraris were handed an unexpected advantage at the as an escalation of the FISA–FOCA war saw the FOCA teams boycott the race, effectively leaving Renault as Ferrari&#x27;s only serious opposition. With Renault driver Prost retiring from fourth place on lap 7 followed by his teammate Arnoux on the 44th lap, Ferrari seemed to have the win guaranteed. In order to conserve fuel and ensure the cars finished, the Ferrari team ordered both drivers to slow down. Villeneuve believed that the order also meant that the drivers were to maintain position but Pironi passed Villeneuve. A few laps later Villeneuve re-passed Pironi and slowed down again, believing that Pironi was simply trying to entertain the Italian crowd. On the last lap Pironi passed and aggressively chopped across the front of Gilles in Villeneuve corner and took the win. Villeneuve was irate as he believed that Pironi had disobeyed the order to hold position. Meanwhile, Pironi claimed that he had done nothing wrong as the team had only ordered the cars to slow down, not maintain position. Villeneuve stated after the race &quot;I think it is well known that if I want someone to stay behind me and I am faster, then he stays behind me.&quot; Feeling betrayed and angry Villeneuve vowed never to speak to Pironi again.

In 2007, John Hogan, the retired Vice President of Marketing at Ferrari sponsor Phillip Morris and later Jaguar Racing team principal who was at the sponsor during Villeneuve&#x27;s career, disputed the claim that Pironi had gone back on a prior arrangement with Villeneuve. He said: &quot;Neither of them would ever have agreed to what effectively was throwing a race. I think Gilles was stunned somebody had out-driven him and that it just caught him so much by surprise.&quot; A comparison of the lap times of the two drivers showed that Villeneuve lapped far slower when he was in the lead, suggesting that he had indeed been trying to save fuel.

==Death==
On May 8, 1982, Villeneuve died after an accident during the final qualifying session for the at Zolder. At the time of the crash, Pironi had set a time one-tenth of a second faster than Villeneuve for sixth place. Villeneuve was using his final set of qualifying tyres; some say he was attempting to improve his time on his final lap, while others suggest he was specifically aiming to beat Pironi. However, Villeneuve&#x27;s biographer Gerald Donaldson quotes Ferrari race engineer Mauro Forghieri as saying that the Canadian, although pressing on in his usual fashion, was returning to the pit lane when the accident occurred. If so, he would not have set a time on that lap.

With eight minutes of the session left, Villeneuve came over the rise after the first chicane and caught Jochen Mass travelling much more slowly through &quot;Butte&quot;, the left-handed bend before the &quot;Terlamenbocht&quot; double right-hand section. Mass saw Villeneuve approaching at high speed and moved to the right to let him through on the racing line. At the same instant Villeneuve also moved right to pass the slower car. The Ferrari hit the back of Mass&#x27; car and was launched into the air at a speed estimated to be . It was airborne for more than before nosediving into the ground and breaking apart as it somersaulted along the edge of the track. Villeneuve, still strapped to his seat, but now without his helmet, was thrown a further from the wreckage into the catch fencing on the outside edge of the &quot;Terlamenbocht&quot; corner.

Several drivers stopped and rushed to the scene. John Watson and Derek Warwick pulled Villeneuve, his face blue, from the catch fence. The first doctor arrived within 35 seconds to find that Villeneuve was not breathing, although with a pulse; he was intubated and ventilated before being transferred to the circuit medical centre and subsequently by helicopter to University St Raphael Hospital in Leuven where a fatal fracture of the neck was diagnosed. Villeneuve was kept alive on life support while his wife travelled to the hospital and the doctors consulted specialists worldwide. He died at 21:12 CEST (UTC+2). An inquiry into the accident was led by Derek Ongaro, the safety inspector for Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), which concluded that an error from Villeneuve caused him to strike Mass&#x27; car and exonerated the latter of any responsibility for the accident.

==Helmet==
Villeneuve&#x27;s helmet had a base colour of dark blue, with a stylised &#x27;V&#x27; in orange on either side—an effect he devised with his wife Joann. Gilles&#x27; son, Jacques, started racing equipped with his father&#x27;s old helmet and boots. British driver Perry McCarthy also used this design and colour scheme on his helmet, but with the design in reverse.

Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc wore a one-off tribute helmet to Villeneuve at the 2023 Canadian Grand Prix, using a similar design.

==Legacy==

In total, Villeneuve competed in 67 Grands Prix, winning six of them and achieving thirteen podium finishes. At his funeral in Berthierville, former teammate Jody Scheckter delivered the eulogy: &quot;For me, firstly, Gilles was the most genuine person I ever knew. Secondly, he was the fastest racing driver that history has ever known. He went doing something that he loved, but he hasn&#x27;t left us, because the world will remember what he has given to motor racing.&quot; In Villeneuve&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, Bob Ferguson and Michael Gee wrote that retrospective comments were complimentary of his driving, and said he was approachable and spoke informally to the media and fans. Niki Lauda said of him: &quot;He was the craziest devil I ever came across in Formula 1... The fact that, for all this, he was a sensitive and lovable character rather than an out-and-out hell-raiser made him such a unique human being&quot;.

Villeneuve is still remembered at Grand Prix races, especially those in Italy. At the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, the venue of the San Marino Grand Prix and Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a corner was named after him and a Canadian flag is painted on the third slot on the starting grid, from which he started his last race. A bronze bust of Villeneuve stands at the entrance to the Ferrari test track at Fiorano. At Zolder the corner where Villeneuve died has been turned into a chicane and named after him.
The racetrack on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, host to the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix, was named Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in his honour at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix and a sign reading “Salut Gilles” was painted at the start/finish line. His home country has continued to honour him: in Berthierville a museum was opened in 1992 and a lifelike statue stands in a nearby park which was also named in his honour. Villeneuve was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame at their inaugural induction ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel, Toronto, Ontario on August 19, 1993. He was also inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. In June 1997 Canada issued a postage stamp in his honour.

There is still a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books have been written about him. The number 27, the number of his Ferrari in 1981 and 1982, is still closely associated with him by fans. Villeneuve&#x27;s son, Jacques, drove the No. 27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used the number for occasional drives in NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing).

==In popular culture==
A film based on the biography by Gerald Donaldson was announced in 2005, to be produced by Capri Films Inc, and with Christian Duguay named as the director; the film has yet to materialise. A new film, to be directed by Daniel Roby, was announced as entering production in 2023.

The popular French comics series &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; by Jean Graton is set in the world of motor racing and, although largely fictional, often includes real-life figures including drivers, officials and journalists. Villeneuve appears in a number of stories, and in &quot;Steve Warson contre Michel Vaillant&quot; (&quot;fr:&quot; &quot;Steve Warson versus Michel Vaillant&quot;) becomes the 1980 World Champion (though in the 1981 season, covered in &quot;Rififi en F1&quot; (&quot;Trouble in F1&quot;), Graton acknowledges Alan Jones as the real Champion) and Quebec progressive rock and pop band The Box based their 1984 song &quot;Live on TV&quot; inspired by Villeneuve&#x27;s televised death. In 2017, Italian rock band, The Rock Alchemist wrote the song, &quot;27&quot; for their &quot;Elements&quot; album as a tribute to Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s #27 Ferrari F1 car.

<text>Herman Potočnik (pseudonym Hermann Noordung; 22 December 1892 – 27 August 1929) was an Austro-Hungarian Army officer, electrical engineer and astronautics theorist. He is regarded as an early theorist of modern space flight and is remembered mainly for his work concerning the long-term human habitation of space.

== Early life ==

Potočnik was born in Pola (now Pula), Istria, then part of the Austria-Hungarian monarchy (now in Croatia). His family was of Slovene ethnicity and originated from Lower Styria (now Slovenia).

Both of Potočnik&#x27;s parents were Slovenian. His father Jožef was born in 1841 in Zgornji Razbor and at the time of Herman&#x27;s birth he served as a doctor and a navy officer of the Austro-Hungarian Navy harbour of Pola. His mother Minka was born February 7, 1854; she was a descendant of Czech immigrants, manufacturers of crucibles for glass-making, and a daughter of a well known wine merchant and local councillor Jožef Kokošinek from Maribor (born in Vitanje). In 1866, Herman&#x27;s father Jožef participated with the second Battle of Vis, where the Austrian Navy commanded by Wilhelm von Tegetthoff defeated the Royal Italian Navy. Jožef was later a general in the Austro-Hungarian Army.

When Herman&#x27;s father died in 1894, his mother relocated the family to Maribor. Herman had two brothers, Adolf and Gustav (who were both navy officers), and a sister Frančiška (Franci). He spent most of his childhood years in Maribor and, according to oral sources, in Vitanje.

The meaning of his German-like pseudonym Noordung is still a mystery, but some suggest that he used it to indicate the problems of chaos (German: &quot;Ordnung&quot;, &quot;order&quot;; &quot;ordunga&quot; in Slovene colloquial language). Assuming that the initial &quot;N&quot; was intended as a negation, the name could mean &quot;no order&quot;.

== Education and military service ==

In Maribor, Potočnik attended primary school. Afterward he attended the military secondary schools in Fischau and Hranice in Moravia. His uncle Heinrich was a major-general in the army, and probably enabled his study at Austrian military schools. From 1910 to 1913 he studied at the Imperial and Royal Technical Military Academy in Mödling in Lower Austria (&quot;Niederösterreich&quot;) near Vienna and graduated as an engineer second lieutenant. His specialization was building of railways and bridges.

During World War I he served in Galicia, Serbia and Bosnia and in 1915 he was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant (&quot;Oberleutnant&quot;). He was assigned to the southwestern front of the Soča battlefield and there he experienced a breakthrough of the Austrian army to the river Piava and its retreat. In 1919 he was pensioned from the Austrian military with the rank of captain because of tuberculosis that he contracted during the war. He started to study electrical engineering in the mechanical engineering department of the University of Technology in Vienna, Austria, and was awarded a doctorate in engineering. From 1925 onward, he devoted himself entirely to the problems of rocket science and space technology. Owing to chronic illness, he did not find a job or marry, but lived with his brother Adolf in Vienna, Austria.

== &quot;The Problem of Space Travel&quot; ==

At the end of 1928, he published his sole book, &quot;Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums - der Raketen-Motor (The Problem of Space Travel - The Rocket Motor)&quot; in Berlin. The publisher, Richard Carl Schmidt, printed the year 1929 as a publishing date, probably from a purely business motive (to keep the book looking new throughout the coming year) and this date is often mistakenly given as the actual date of publication. In 188 pages and 100 handmade illustrations, Potočnik described a plan for establishment of a permanent human presence in outer space. He conceived a detailed design for a space station, regarded by Russian and American historians of spaceflight to be the first Space architecture. 
He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for detailed observation of the ground for peaceful and military purposes, and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. Potočnik expressed strong doubts of the potentially destructive military use of these fresh discoveries.

The book was translated into Russian during early 1935, Slovene in 1986 (by the Slovenska matica), English in 1995 (by NASA) and Croatian in 2004 (by Marino Fonović, published by Labin Art Press). A partial translation to English, containing most of the essential chapters, was made as early as 1929 for the American magazine &quot;Science Wonder Stories&quot; and was issued in three parts (July, August and September 1929) and credited to &quot;Captain Hermann Noordung, A.D., M.E., Berlin.&quot; The article was also published in Science Wonder Stories&#x27; affiliated publication Air Wonder Stories at the same time.

With his many ideas he became one of the founders of astronautics. His concepts were first considered seriously only by amateur rocketeers in Germany, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR - &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;), the most notable of whom was Hermann Oberth. In its Russian edition, the book may also have influenced Sergey Korolev and his acquaintances.
More locally, Viennese engineers dismissed his work as fantasy.
Potočnik&#x27;s book described geostationary satellites (first proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but did not suggest the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays (developed by Arthur C. Clarke in his article &quot;Wireless World&quot; of 1945). The wheel-shaped space station served as an inspiration for further development by Wernher von Braun (another former VfR member) in 1952. Von Braun considered orbiting space stations as intermediate to travel to other planets. In 1955 and 1968, George Pal&#x27;s and Byron Haskin&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of Space&quot; (based on Wernher von Braun&#x27;s published concepts: first, several articles in Collier&#x27;s magazine 1952– 54, co-written with Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell, and later developed into books from Viking Press. ) and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, respectively, depicted such a role for &quot;Space Station V&quot;.

== Death ==

Potočnik died of pneumonia at the age of 36 while in great poverty in Vienna, Austria, and was buried there. An obituary notice about his death was printed in one Maribor daily newspaper, mentioning his ranks (engineers and captain), his illness, but nothing about his work regarding space.

== Legacy ==

* Streets in Graz and Ljubljana now bear his name.
* A proposal was made during the late 1990s to name the International Space Station after him, but was not adopted.
* In 1999 a two-day international memorial symposium about his life and work was held at the University of Maribor, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the first printing of his famous book.
* Asteroid 19612 Noordung, found in 1999 at Črni Vrh Observatory, is named after him.
* In 2006, the Herman Potočnik Noordung Memorial Centre (HPNMC) was built in Vitanje, Slovenia.
* There is activity to construct a statue of Herman Potočnik in his birthplace of Pula.
* In 2012, the Cultural Centre of European Space Technologies (KSEVT), inspired by his work, was built in Vitanje, Slovenia.

Its women&#x27;s teams include volleyball, basketball, cross country, swimming and diving, soccer, track and field, gymnastics, golf, softball and tennis. Most of these teams compete in the Mountain West Conference (MWC).

Boise State College joined the NCAA in 1970 in the university division (Division I), except for football, which was in the college division (later Division II) for the first eight seasons. Big Sky Conference football moved up to the new Division I-AA (now FCS) in 1978, and the Broncos won the national championship two years later. BSU moved up to Division I-A (now FBS) in 1996 in the Big West Conference, joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2001, and the Mountain West in 2011.

=== Albertsons Stadium ===

Albertsons Stadium is home to the Boise State football program. It hosted the NCAA Division I Track and Field Championships in 1994 and 1999, and has been the home to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl since 1997.
Boise State Football has a long history of success starting with the junior college days and the national championship team of 1958, coached by the father of Bronco football, Lyle Smith. Now named Lyle Smith Field in Albertsons Stadium, the synthetic turf field was standard green before 1986. &quot;The Blue&quot; was the idea of athletic director Gene Bleymaier and was the first non-green football field in the country. This field is also nicknamed &quot;The Smurf Turf&quot; due to its color. Through 2019, Boise State&#x27;s home record was in 34 seasons on The Blue, with fifteen conference championships.

Ground was broken after the 1969 season, and it opened in September 1970 with a capacity of 14,500. Subsequent expansions were completed in 1975 and 1997, and current capacity sits at around 37,000.

==== ExtraMile Arena ====
Known as the &quot;Boise State University Pavilion&quot; until June 2004, and &quot;Taco Bell Arena&quot; between 2004 and 2019, ExtraMile Arena is home to BSU basketball, wrestling, women&#x27;s gymnastics, community events, and several concerts each year. Opened in May 1982, the arena seats 12,380 on three levels. It has hosted rounds one and two of the NCAA basketball tournament on eight occasions from 1983 to 2009, and the third and fourth rounds of the NCAA women&#x27;s tournament in 2002.

The construction of the pavilion began in February 1980 on the site of the tennis courts and a portion of the BSU baseball field. The Bronco baseball team played their home games in 1980 at Borah Field (now Bill Wigle Field) at Borah High School, and the program was discontinued that May. The tennis courts were rebuilt immediately west of the arena, on the former baseball field (infield &amp; right field).

==Student life==

Boise State&#x27;s enrollment for the 2023-24 year was 26,727 students, with approximately 69 percent Idaho residents. Boise State University has the largest graduate enrollment in Idaho. More than 90 percent of Boise State&#x27;s first-year students come directly from high school.

=== Housing ===
At Boise State &quot;18% of the students live in college-owned, -operated or -affiliated housing and 82% of students live off campus.&quot;

===Social fraternities and sororities===
Boise State has seen an increase in its Greek community; as of fall of 2023, there are 8 Panhellenic sororities and 11 fraternities active on campus. In 2023, the fraternity Alpha Kappa Lambda was suspended for a period of four years due to hazing rituals and incidents of alcohol abuse.

<doc id="86646" wikidata="Q6647001" url="?curid=86646" title="National myth">
<text>A national myth is an inspiring narrative or anecdote about a nation&#x27;s past. Such myths often serve as important national symbols and affirm a set of national values. A myth is a mixture of reality and fiction, and operates in a specific social and historical setting. Social myths structure national imaginaries. A national myth may take the form of a national epic, or it may be incorporated into a civil religion. A group of related myths about a nation may be referred to as the national mythos, from μῦθος, .

A national myth is a narrative which has been elevated to a serious symbolic and esteemed level so as to be true to the nation. The national folklore of many nations includes a founding myth, which may involve a struggle against colonialism or a war of independence or unification. In many cases, the meaning of the national myth is disputed among different parts of the population. In some places, the national myth may be spiritual and refer to stories of the nation&#x27;s founding by a God, several gods, leaders favored by gods, or other supernatural beings.National myths often exist only for the purpose of state-sponsored propaganda. In totalitarian dictatorships, the leader might be given, for example, a mythical supernatural life history in order to make them seem god-like and supra-powerful (see also cult of personality). In liberal regimes they can inspire civic virtue and self-sacrifice or consolidate the power of dominant groups and legitimate their rule.

== National identity ==

The concept of national identity is inescapably connected with myths. A complex of myths is at the core of nationalistic ethnic identity. Some scholars believe that national identities, supported by invented histories, were constructed only after national movements and national ideologies emerged.

All modern national identities were preceded by nationalist movements. Although the term &quot;nation&quot; was used in the Middle Ages, it had usually an ethnic meaning and seldom referred to a state. In the age of nationalism, it was linked to efforts aimed at creating nation-states.

National myths foster national identities. They are important tools of nation-building, which can be done by emphasizing differences between people of different nations. They can cause conflict as they exaggerate threats posed by other nations and minimize the costs of war.

The nationalist myth of a stable homeland community is explained psychoanalytically as the result of the complexity of relations within the modern external world and the incoherence of one&#x27;s inner psychological world. Nationalist identity facilitates imagined stability.

== Dissemination ==
National myths are created and propagated by national intellectuals, and they can be used as instruments of political mobilization on demographic bases such as ethnicity.

They might over-dramatize true incidents, omit important historical details, or add details for which there is no evidence; or a national myth might simply be a fictional story that no one takes to be true literally.

=== Mythopoeic methods ===
Traditional myth-making often depended on literary story-tellers — especially epic poets. Ancient Hellenic culture adopted Homer&#x27;s Ionian &quot;Iliad&quot; as a justification of its theoretical unity, and Virgil (70–19 BCE) composed the &quot;Aeneid&quot; in support of the political renewal and reunification of the Roman world after lengthy civil wars. Generations of medieval writers (in poetry and prose) contributed to the Arthurian Matter of Britain, developing what became a focus for English nationalism by adopting British Celtic material. Camões (–1580) composed in Macao the &quot;Lusiads&quot; as a national poetic epic for Portugal. Voltaire attempted a similar work for French mythologised history in the &quot;Henriade&quot; (1723). Wagnerian opera came to foster German national enthusiasm.

=== Other methods ===
Modern purveyors of national mythologies have tended to appeal to the people more directly through the media. French pamphleteers spread the ideas of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity in the 1790s, and American journalists, politicians, and scholars popularized mythic tropes like &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, &quot;the Frontier&quot;, or the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot;. Socialists advocating ideas like the dictatorship of the proletariat have promoted catchy nation-promoting slogans such as &quot;Socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; and &quot;Kim Il Sung thought&quot;.

==National myths==
The ideology of nationalism is related to two myths: the myth of the eternal nation, referring to the permanence of a community, and the myth of common ancestry. These are represented in the particular national myths of various countries and groups.

===Brazil===
The national myth of Brazil as a racial democracy was first advanced by Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freyre in his 1933 work &quot;Casa-Grande &amp; Senzala&quot;, which argues that Brazilians do not view each other through the lens of race, and that Brazilian society eliminated racism and racial discrimination. Freyre&#x27;s theory became a source of national pride for Brazil, which contrasted itself favorably vis-a-vis the contemporaneous racial divisions and violence in the United States.

===Finland===
The &quot;Kalevala&quot; is a 19th-century work of epic poetry compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology. The &quot;Kalevala&quot; is regarded as the national epic of Karelia and Finland 
It narrates an epic story about the Creation of the Earth, describing the controversies and retaliatory voyages between the peoples of the land of Kalevala called Väinölä and the land of Pohjola and their various protagonists and antagonists as well as the construction and robbery of the epic mythical wealth-making machine Sampo. The &quot;Kalevala&quot; was instrumental in the development of the Finnish national identity and the intensification of Finland&#x27;s language strife that ultimately led to Finland&#x27;s independence from Russia in 1917.

===Great Britain===
King Arthur was a legendary noble king that united Britain, laid the foundation to medieval notions of chivalry in western Europe, and was later important for building a common British identity.

===Greece===
According to Greek mythology, the Hellenes descend from Hellen. He is the child of Deucalion (or Zeus) and Pyrrha, and the father of three sons, Dorus, Xuthus, and Aeolus, by whom he is the ancestor of the Greek peoples.

===Iceland===
The sagas of Icelanders, also known as family sagas, are one sub-genre or text groups of Icelandic sagas. They are prose narratives mostly based on historical events that mostly took place in Iceland in the ninth, tenth, and early eleventh centuries, during the so-called Saga Age. They were written in Old Icelandic, a western dialect of Old Norse. They are the best-known specimens of Icelandic literature. They are focused on history, especially genealogical and family history. They reflect the struggle and conflict that arose within the societies of the early generations of Icelandic settlers. The Icelandic sagas are valuable and unique historical sources about medieval Scandinavian societies and kingdoms, in particular regarding pre-Christian religion and culture and heroic age.

===Italy===
The Kingdom of Fanes is the national epic of the Ladin people in the Dolomites and the most important part of the Ladin literature. Originally an orally transmitted epic cycle, today it is known through the work of Karl Felix Wolff in 1932, gathered in &quot;Dolomitensagen&quot;. This legend is part of the larger corpus of the South Tyrolean sagas, whose protagonists are the Fanes themselves.

===Iran===
The Shahnameh is a long epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between and 1010 CE and is the national epic of Persia. Consisting of some 50,000 distichs or couplets (two-line verses), the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s longest epic poems, and the longest epic poem created by a single author. It tells mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Muslim conquest in the seventh century.

===Israel===
The Promised Land is Middle Eastern land that Abrahamic religions (which include Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and others) claim their God promised and subsequently gave to Abraham (the legendary patriarch in Abrahamic religions) and several more times to his descendants.The concept of the Promised Land originates from a religious narrative written in the Hebrew religious text, the Torah.

===Japan===
In Japanese mythology, Emperor Jimmu is the legendary first emperor of Japan. He is described in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and &quot;Kojiki&quot;. His ascension is traditionally dated as 660 BC. He is said to be a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, through her grandson Ninigi, as well as a descendant of the storm god Susanoo. He launched a military expedition from Hyūga near the Seto Inland Sea, captured Yamato, and established this as his center of power. In modern Japan, Emperor Jimmu&#x27;s legendary accession is marked as National Foundation Day on February 11. There is no evidence to suggest that Jimmu existed. However, there is a high probability that there was a powerful dynasty in the vicinity of Miyazaki Prefecture during the Kofun period.

===Korea===
The first Korean kingdom is said to have been founded by Dangun, the legendary founder and god-king of Gojoseon, in 2333 BCE. Dangun is said to be the &quot;grandson of heaven&quot; and &quot;son of a bear&quot;. The earliest recorded version of the Dangun legend appears in the 13th-century &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, which cites China&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wei&quot; and Korea&#x27;s lost historical record &quot;Gogi&quot;; it has been confirmed that there is no relevant record in China&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wei&quot;. There are around seventeen religious groups involving the worship of Dangun.

===Nazi Germany===
The Master race is a Nazi ideology propaganda of pseudoscientific racial theories purporting that ethnic Germans belonged to a superior Aryan or Nordic race, which combined with other antisemitic myths (including stab-in-the-back), which resulted in Nazi Germany and its justification for conquering Europe (for &quot;living space&quot;) and for The Holocaust, its genocide of those it mythologized were threats and lesser races, primarily Jews.

===New Zealand===
The Treaty of Waitangi is a document of central importance to the history of New Zealand, its constitution, and its national mythos. It has played a major role in the treatment of the Māori people in New Zealand by successive governments and the wider population, something that has been especially prominent since the late 20th century. The treaty document is an agreement, not a treaty as recognised in international law, and has no independent legal status. It was first signed on 6 February 1840 by Captain William Hobson as consul for the British Crown and by Māori chiefs () from the North Island of New Zealand.

Kupe was a legendary Polynesian explorer who was the first person to discover New Zealand, according to Māori oral history. It is likely that Kupe existed historically, but this is difficult to confirm. His voyage to New Zealand ensured that the land was known to the Polynesians, and he would therefore be responsible for the genesis of the Māori people.

===Serbia===
The Kosovo Myth is a Serbian national myth based on legends about events related to the Battle of Kosovo (1389). It has been a subject in Serbian folklore and literary tradition and has been cultivated oral epic poetry and guslar poems. The final form of the legend was not created immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. In its modern form it emerged in 19th-century Serbia and served as an important constitutive element of the national identity of modern Serbia and its politics.

===United States of America===
The American frontier (also known as the Old West or Wild West) is a theme in American mythology that defines the American national identity as brave pioneers who discovered, conquered, and settled the vast wilderness. It affirms individualism, informality, and pragmatism as American values. Richard Slotkin describes this myth as depicting &quot;America as a wide-open land of unlimited opportunity for the strong, ambitious, self-reliant individual to thrust his way to the top.&quot; Cowboys, gunfighters, and farmers are commonly appearing archetypes in this myth. The American frontier produced various mythologized figures such as Wild Bill Hickok, Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, Annie Oakley, Doc Holliday, Butch Cassidy, and Davy Crockett. The mythology surrounding the American frontier is immortalized in the Western genre of fiction, particularly Western films and literature.

<text>Walter Percy Chrysler (April 2, 1875 – August 18, 1940) was an American industrial pioneer in the automotive industry, American automotive industry executive and the founder and namesake of American Chrysler Corporation.

==Early life==
Chrysler was born in Wamego, Kansas, the son of Anna Maria Chrysler (née Breymann) and Henry Chrysler. He grew up in Ellis, Kansas, where today his boyhood home is a museum. His father was born in Chatham, Ontario, in 1850 and immigrated to the United States after 1858. A Freemason, Chrysler began his career as a machinist and railroad mechanic in Ellis. He took correspondence courses from International Correspondence Schools in Scranton, Pennsylvania, earning a mechanical degree from the correspondence program.

==Ancestry==
Walter Chrysler&#x27;s father, Henry (Hank) Chrysler, was a Canadian, of German, English and Dutch ancestry. He was an American Civil War veteran who was a locomotive engineer for the Kansas Pacific Railway and its successor, the Union Pacific Railroad. Walter&#x27;s mother was born in Rocheport, Missouri, and was also of German ancestry. Walter Chrysler was not especially interested in his remote ancestors; his collaborative author Boyden Sparkes says that one genealogical researcher reported &quot;that he had a sea-going Dutchman among his forebears; one Captain Jan Gerritsen Van Dalsen&quot;, but that &quot;as to that, Walter Chrysler made it plain to me he was in accord with Jimmy Durante: &#x27;Ancestors? I got millions of &#x27;em!&#x27;.&quot; However, he thought enough of genealogy to include in his autobiography that his father, Hank Chrysler, &quot;Canadian born, had been brought from Chatham, Ontario, to Kansas City when he was only five or six. His forebears had founded Chatham; the family stock was German; eight generations back of me there had come to America one who spelled his name Greisler, a German Palatine. He was one of a group of Protestants who had left their German homeland in the Rhine Valley, gone to the Netherlands, thence to England and embarked, finally, from Plymouth for New York.&quot;

Other researchers have since traced his ancestors in more detail. Karin Holl&#x27;s monograph on the subject traces the family tree to a Johann Philipp Kreißler, born in 1672, who left Germany for Canada in 1709. Chrysler&#x27;s ancestors came from the Rhineland-Palatinate town of Guntersblum. His family belongs to Old Stock Americans.

==Railroad career==
Chrysler apprenticed in the railroad shops at Ellis as a machinist and railroad mechanic. He then spent a period of years roaming the west, working for various railroads as a roundhouse mechanic with a reputation of being good at valve-setting jobs. Chrysler moved frequently, first to Wellington, Kansas, in 1897, then to Denver, Colorado for two weeks, and finally Cheyenne, Wyoming. Some of his moves were due to restlessness and a quick temper, but his roaming was also a way to become more well-rounded in his railroad knowledge. He worked his way up through positions such as foreman in Trinidad, Colorado, superintendent, division master mechanic, and general master mechanic.

During 1905 and 1906, Chrysler worked for the Fort Worth and Denver Railway in Childress in West Texas. He later lived and worked in Oelwein, Iowa, at the main shops of the Chicago Great Western, where there is a small park dedicated to him.

The pinnacle of his railroading career came at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he became works manager of the Allegheny locomotive erecting shops of the American Locomotive Company (Alco). While working in Pittsburgh, Chrysler lived in the town of Bellevue, the first town outside of Pittsburgh on the north side of the Ohio River.

==Automotive career==
Chrysler&#x27;s automotive career began in 1911 when he received a summons to meet with James J. Storrow, a banker who was a director of Alco. Storrow asked him if he had given any thought to automobile manufacture. Chrysler had been an auto enthusiast for over five years by then, and was very interested. Storrow arranged a meeting with Charles W. Nash, then president of the Buick Motor Company, who was looking for a smart production chief. Chrysler, who had resigned from many railroading jobs over the years, made his final resignation from railroading to become works manager (in charge of production) at Buick in Flint, Michigan. He found many ways to reduce the costs of production, such as putting an end to finishing automobile undercarriages with the same luxurious quality of finish that the body warranted.

In 1916, William C. Durant, who founded General Motors in 1908, had retaken GM from bankers who had taken over the company. Chrysler, who was closely tied to the bankers, submitted his resignation to Durant, then based in New York City.

Durant took the first train to Flint to make an attempt to keep Chrysler at the helm of Buick. Durant made the then-unheard of salary offer of $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) a month for three years, with a $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) bonus at the end of each year, or $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in stock. Additionally, Chrysler would report directly to Durant, and would have full run of Buick without interference from anyone. Apparently in shock, Chrysler asked Durant to repeat the offer, which he did. Chrysler immediately accepted.

Chrysler ran Buick successfully for three more years. Not long after his three-year contract was up, he resigned from his job as president of Buick in 1919. He did not agree with Durant&#x27;s vision for the future of General Motors. Durant paid Chrysler $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) for his GM stock. Chrysler had started at Buick in 1911 for $6,000 a year (equivalent to $ in ), and left one of the richest men in the United States. GM replaced Chrysler with Harry H. Bassett a protege who had risen through the ranks at the Weston-Mott axle manufacturing company, by then a subsidiary of Buick.

Chrysler was then hired to attempt a turnaround by bankers who foresaw the loss of their investment in Willys-Overland Motor Company in Toledo, Ohio. He demanded and received a salary of $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) a year for two years, an astonishing amount at that time. When Chrysler left Willys in 1921 after an unsuccessful attempt to wrestle control from John Willys, he acquired a controlling interest in the ailing Maxwell Motor Company. Chrysler phased out Maxwell and absorbed it into his new firm, the Chrysler Corporation, in Detroit, Michigan, in 1925. In addition to his namesake car company, Plymouth and DeSoto marques were created, and in 1928 Chrysler purchased Dodge Brothers and renamed it Dodge. The same year he financed the construction of the Chrysler Building in New York City, which was completed in 1930. Chrysler was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year for 1928.

He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1967.

==Later years==
In 1923, Chrysler purchased from Henri Willis Bendel a waterfront estate at Kings Point on Long Island, New York, and renamed it Forker House. In December 1941, the property was sold to the U.S. government&#x27;s War Shipping Department and became known as Wiley Hall as part of the United States Merchant Marine Academy.

Chrysler also built a country estate in Warrenton, Virginia, in what is referred to as the Virginia horse country and home to the Warrenton Hunt. In 1934, he purchased and undertook a major restoration of the Fauquier White Sulphur Springs Company resort and spa in Warrenton. Sold in 1953, the property was developed as a country club.

Chrysler turned 61 in the spring of 1936 and stepped down from an active role in the day-to-day business of the company. Two years later, his wife died at the age of 58 and Chrysler, devastated by the loss of his childhood sweetheart, suffered a stroke. His previously robust health never recovered from this, and he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in August 1940 at Forker House in Kings Point, New York. He was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

<text>Harold James Ruthven Murray (24 June 1868 – 16 May 1955) was a British educationalist, inspector of schools, and prominent chess historian. His book, &quot;A History of Chess&quot;, is widely regarded as the most authoritative and comprehensive history of the game.

==Early life and education==
Murray, the eldest of eleven children, was born near Peckham Rye in Peckham, London. The son of Sir James Murray, the first editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, he attended school at Mill Hill and, in his spare time, helped his father produce the first edition of the OED. By the time Harold had finished school and was preparing to leave for university, he had produced over 27,000 quotations that later appeared in the OED.

He won a place at Balliol College, Oxford where in 1890 he graduated with a first class degree in mathematics. He became an assistant master at Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton where he learned to play chess. Later he was assistant master at Carlisle Grammar School, and in 1896 became headmaster of Ormskirk Grammar School in Lancashire. On 4 January 1897, he married Kate Maitland Crosthwaite. In 1901, he was appointed a school inspector, and in 1928 he became a member of the Board of Education.

Murray was a champion of the left-handed, defending children against the attempts of schools to make them conform by using their right hands.

==&quot;History of Chess&quot;==
In 1897, Murray was encouraged by Baron von der Lasa (who had just completed his book on the history of European chess) to research the history of chess. Murray gained access to the largest chess library in the world, that of John G. White of Cleveland, Ohio, and also used the collection of J. W. Rimington Wilson in England. The White collection contained some Arabic manuscripts, so Murray learned Arabic, and German. The research took him 13 years, during which time he contributed articles on aspects of chess history to the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Deutsches Wochenschach&quot;. In 1913 he published &quot;A History of Chess&quot;, proposing the theory that chess originated in India. This remains the most widely accepted theory. (See Origins of chess.)

Although &quot;A History of Chess&quot; was recognised as the standard reference on the subject, its scholarly approach and great length (900 pages) made it inaccessible to most chess players. Murray began a shorter work on chess history written in a more popular style; it remained unfinished at his death and was completed by B. Goulding Brown and Harry Golombek and published in 1963 as &quot;A Short History of Chess&quot;.

Murray was the father of educationalist and biographer K. M. Elisabeth Murray and the archaeologist Kenneth Murray.

==Other areas of research==
In 1952 Murray published &quot;A History of Board Games other than Chess&quot;. His work there on other games has received some criticism. Notably, he was skeptical of the consensus history of the game Go; he wrote that &quot;weiqi&quot; (the Chinese term for Go) dated to 1000 AD at the earliest, and wrote that Chinese historians had exaggerated the antiquity of the game as well as their inventions in general. Historians of Go have not agreed with Murray&#x27;s eccentric position; archaeological evidence (some of it post-dating Murray&#x27;s work, in fairness) exists of &quot;weiqi&quot; boards from 200 AD as well as pictures of a Go player dated to around 750 AD, as does background evidence of recorded stories, anecdotes, manuals, and so on that all date long before 1000 AD.

&quot;A History of Board Games Other Than Chess&quot; has been nonetheless praised as the first attempt to develop a &quot;scheme for the classification of board games&quot;.

<text>Brunswick Cathedral (, lit. in ) is a large Lutheran church in the City of Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.

The church is termed &quot;Dom&quot;, in German a synecdoche - pars pro toto - used for cathedrals and collegiate churches alike, and much like the Italian &quot;duomo&quot;. It is currently owned and used by a congregation of the Lutheran Church in Brunswick.

==History==
Henry the Lion established the original foundation as a collegiate church, built between 1173 and 1195. Among the most important pieces on display in the church are a wooden crucifix by Master Imervard dating from the second half of the 12th century and one of very few huge bronze candlesticks with seven arms, dating from around the 1170s.

The construction of the church was disrupted several times during the various exiles of Henry the Lion, so that he and his consort Matilda, Duchess of Saxony, were both buried in an unfinished church. The limestone statues of them on their tomb in the nave are an idealised representation made a generation after their death, between 1230 and 1240. The cathedral was consecrated on 29 December 1226, dedicated to Saints Blaise, John the Baptist and Thomas Becket. In 1543, at the time of the Protestant Reformation, the City of Brunswick, in opposition to Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, joined the Schmalkaldic League, and the church came into Lutheran use. Its college was dissolved.

Until 1671, the cathedral held a medieval collection of ecclesiastical relics that later became known as the Welfenschatz. In 2015, Germany declared 42 pieces of the Welfenschatz a national treasure, designating them as the Guelph Treasure. These relics are maintained by a foundation known as the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (SPK), and displayed at the Bode-Museum in Berlin. The cathedral lost possession of the collection in 1671 when the relics were removed by John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Calenberg. Until 1803, a portion was housed at the court chapel at Hanover. In 1929, 82 relics were sold by Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick to a consortium of German-Jewish art dealers. They in turn sold 40 pieces to mostly private collectors, except for nine that went to the Cleveland Museum of Art. The remaining 42 pieces were sold as a group in 1935. After the collection&#x27;s designation as a national treasure in 2015, heirs of the art dealers brought common lawsuit(s) against Germany in U.S. courts in an attempt to recover perceived losses resulting from the 1935 sale. Germany&#x27;s motion to dismiss on the basis of jurisdiction and conflicts with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was denied once, then again in an appeal. Germany sought intervention by the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court heard the case (FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ET AL. v. PHILIPP ET AL) in October 2020 and issued on 3 February 2021, an order that vacated and remanded the case back to US District Court.

The cathedral is the burial place of Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1175/76-1218) and Caroline of Brunswick, Queen Consort of George IV of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="86651" wikidata="Q723547" url="?curid=86651" title="William Chester Minor">
<text>William Chester Minor (also known as W. C. Minor; 22 June 1834 – 26 March 1920) was an American army surgeon, psychiatric hospital patient, and lexicographical researcher.

After serving in the Union Army during the American Civil War, Minor moved to England. Affected by delusions, he shot a man who he believed had broken into his room, and was consequently committed from 1872 to 1910 to a secure British psychiatric hospital.

While incarcerated, Minor became an important contributor to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. He was one of the project&#x27;s most effective volunteers, reading through his large personal library of antiquarian books and compiling quotations that illustrated how particular words were used.

In 1910, responding to protests about Minor&#x27;s treatment, Winston Churchill, then British home secretary, ordered Minor deported to the United States. Minor was hospitalized in Connecticut, where he died in 1920.

==Early life==
Minor was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the son of Eastman Strong Minor and his first wife, Lucy Bailey. His parents were Congregational church missionaries from New England. He had numerous half-siblings, among them Thomas T. Minor, mayor of Seattle, Washington. At age 14, he was sent to the United States, where he lived with relatives in New Haven while attending Hopkins Grammar School. He subsequently enrolled at the Yale School of Medicine, supporting himself during his years as a medical student with part-time employment as an instructor at the Russell Academy and as an assistant on the 1864 revision of Webster&#x27;s Dictionary, then in preparation at Yale under the supervision of Noah Porter. Minor graduated in 1863 with a medical degree and a specialization in comparative anatomy. After a brief stint at Knight General Hospital in New Haven he joined the Union Army.

==Military career==
He was accepted by the Union Army as a surgeon and may have served at the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, which was notable for the terrible casualties suffered by both sides. There is an unverified story of Minor also being given the task of punishing an Irish soldier in the Union Army by branding him on the face with a &quot;D&quot; for &quot;deserter&quot; and that this incident later played a role in Minor&#x27;s delusions. Historians disagree as to whether the Union Army used branding as a punishment for desertion, which means that the story may be fabricated. Moreover, it is unlikely Minor was present at the Battle of the Wilderness, which took place May 5–7, 1864, since his military records place him at Knight USA Hospital in New Haven at that time and do not show him arriving at 2 Division Hospital USA at Alexandria, Virginia, until May 17.

After the end of the Civil War, Minor saw duty in New York City. He was strongly attracted to the red-light district of the city and devoted much of his off-duty time to consorting with prostitutes. By 1867, his behavior had come to the attention of the army and he was transferred to a remote post in the Florida Panhandle. By 1868, his condition had progressed to the point that he was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a lunatic asylum (as mental health hospitals were then called) in Washington, D.C. After 18 months he showed no improvement.

==Move to England and the killing of Merrett==

In 1871, Minor went to London for a change of pace to help his mental condition. In 1872, he was living in Tenison Street, Lambeth, where once again he took up a dissolute life. On February 17, 1872, haunted by his paranoia, he fatally shot George Merrett, whom Minor wrongly believed to have broken into his room. Merrett had been on his way to work to support his family: six children and his pregnant wife, Eliza.

After a pre-trial period spent in London&#x27;s Horsemonger Lane Gaol, Minor was found not guilty by reason of insanity and incarcerated at the asylum in Broadmoor in the village of Crowthorne, Berkshire. As he had his US Army pension and was judged not dangerous, he was given rather comfortable quarters and was able to buy and read books.

==Contributor to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;==

It was probably through his correspondence with the London booksellers that he heard of the call for volunteers for what was to become the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED). He devoted most of the remainder of his life to that work. He became one of the project&#x27;s most effective volunteers, reading through his large personal library of antiquarian books and compiling quotations that illustrated the way particular words were used. He was often visited by the widow of the man he had killed, and she provided him with further books. The compilers of the dictionary published lists of words for which they wanted examples of usage. Minor provided these with increasing ease as the lists grew. It was many years before the &quot;OED&quot;″s editor, James Murray, learned of Minor&#x27;s history and visited him in January 1891 (as well as many times thereafter). In 1899, Murray paid compliment to Minor&#x27;s enormous contributions to the dictionary, stating, &quot;we could easily illustrate the last four centuries from his quotations alone&quot;.

==Mutilation, decline, and death==
Minor&#x27;s condition deteriorated. In 1902, he was suffering delusions that he was being abducted nightly from his rooms and conveyed to such distant places as Istanbul, where he was forced to commit sexual assaults on children. He cut off his own penis (autopenectomy) to prevent such actions. He used a knife he otherwise used in his work on the dictionary. His health continued to worsen and, after Murray campaigned on his behalf, Minor was released in 1910 on the orders of the then Home Secretary, 35 year-old Winston Churchill.

Minor was deported back to the United States and resided at St. Elizabeths Hospital. There, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1919 he was moved to the Retreat for the Elderly Insane in Hartford, Connecticut, where he died in 1920.

==In popular culture==
In July 1915, the Washington D.C. Sunday Star published a &quot;sensationalized&quot; story beginning with the line &quot;American Murderer Helped Write Oxford Dictionary&quot;. The book &quot;The Surgeon of Crowthorne&quot; (published in America as &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;), by Simon Winchester, was published in 1998 and chronicles both Minor&#x27;s later life and his contributions to the creation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. A movie based on the book, called &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot;, starring Mel Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor, was released in May 2019.

Minor&#x27;s life was also detailed in an episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot;. He was portrayed by Bob Odenkirk.

<text>Hamilton (, ) is an inland city in the North Island of New Zealand. Located on the banks of the Waikato River, it is the seat and most populous city of the Waikato region. With a territorial population of , it is the country&#x27;s fourth most-populous city. Encompassing a land area of about , Hamilton is part of the wider Hamilton Urban Area, which also encompasses the nearby towns of Ngāruawāhia, Te Awamutu and Cambridge. In 2020, Hamilton was awarded the title of most beautiful large city in New Zealand. Hamilton is now considered the fastest growing city in the country.

The area now covered by the city began as the site of several Māori villages, including Kirikiriroa, from which the city takes its Māori name. By the time English settlers arrived, most of these villages, which sat beside the Waikato River, were abandoned as a result of the Invasion of Waikato and land confiscation () by the Crown.

The settlers developed the city as an agricultural service centre, but it now has a diverse economy. Hamilton Gardens is the region&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction. Education and research and development play an important part in Hamilton&#x27;s economy, as the city is home to approximately 40,000 tertiary students and 1,000 PhD-qualified scientists.

==Name==

The settlement was named by Colonel William Moule after Captain John Fane Charles Hamilton, the commander of HMS &quot;Esk&quot;, who was killed in the battle of Gate Pā, Tauranga. On 10 March 2013 a statue of Captain Hamilton was given to the city by the Gallagher Group; a gesture that has since been viewed as controversial by some. On 12 June 2020, the Hamilton City Council removed the statue at the request of local Māori iwi Waikato Tainui. The statue&#x27;s removal has been linked to calls for the removal of statues of figures associated with colonialism and racism in New Zealand and the world, which were precipitated by the protests related to the murder of George Floyd. A local Māori elder Taitimu Maipi, who had vandalised the statue in 2018, has also called for the city to be renamed Kirikiriroa, its original Māori name.

==History==
===Pre-European settlement===
The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several Māori villages (kāinga), including Te Parapara, Pukete, Miropiko and Kirikiriroa (&quot;long stretch of gravel&#x27;), from which the city takes its Māori name. Local Māori were the target of raids by Ngāpuhi during the Musket Wars, and several pā sites from this period can still be found beside the Waikato River. In December 2011 several rua or food storage pits were found near the Waikato River bank, close to the Waikato museum.

In 1822, Kirikiriroa Pa was briefly abandoned to escape the Musket Wars. However, by the 1830s Ngati Wairere’s principal pa was Kirikiriroa, where the missionaries, who arrived at that time, estimated 200 people lived permanently. A chapel and house were built at Kirikiriroa for visiting clergy, presumably after Benjamin Ashwell established his mission near Taupiri.

Between 1845 and 1855, crops such as wheat, fruit and potatoes were exported to Auckland, with up to 50 canoes serving Kirikiriroa. Imports included blankets, clothing, axes, sugar, rum, and tobacco. Millstones were acquired and a water wheel constructed, though possibly the flour mill wasn&#x27;t completed. However, one article said Kirikiriroa flour was well known.

Magistrate Gorst, estimated that Kirikiriroa had a population of about 78 before the Invasion of Waikato via the Waikato Wars of 1863–64. The government estimated the Waikato area had a Māori population of 3,400 at the same time. After the war in the Waikato, large areas of land (1.2 Million Acres), including the area of the present city of Hamilton were confiscated by the Crown under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863. Over the next year, most of these villages were abandoned as a result of the land confiscation, also known as &quot;Raupatu&quot;. 
===Pakeha settlement===
After the Invasion of the Waikato and confiscation of the invaded land, militia-settlers were recruited in Melbourne and Sydney. On 10 August 1864 the government advertised for tenders to build 10 huts and a hospital at Kirikiriroa. Hamilton was settled by the 4th Waikato Regiment Militia, led by Captain William Steele. The 1st Regiment was at Tauranga, the 2nd at Pirongia, the 3rd at Cambridge and the 4th at Kirikiriroa. The first military settlers arrived on the &quot;Rangiriri&quot; on 24 August 1864. Members of Ngāti Wairere assembled on the banks of the river as the &quot;Rangiriri&quot; arrived and threw peaches at her. One of the passengers, Teresa Vowless, passed her baby to another passenger and leapt overboard in order to be the first settler ashore. 

Many of the soldier/settlers who intended to farm after the 1863 war, walked off their land in 1868 due to its poor quality. Much of the land was swampy or under water. In 1868 Hamilton&#x27;s population, which was about 1,000 in 1864, dropped to 300 as farmers left. On 22 December 1875 the first brickworks opened in Hamilton.

===19th century development===

The road from Auckland reached Hamilton in 1867 and the railway in December 1877. That same month, the towns of Hamilton West and Hamilton East merged under a single borough council. The first traffic bridge between Hamilton West and Hamilton East, known as the Union Bridge, opened in 1879. It was replaced by the Victoria Bridge in 1910.

The first railway bridge, the Claudelands Bridge, was opened in 1884. It was converted to a road traffic bridge in 1965. Hamilton reached 1,000 people in 1900, and the town of Frankton merged with the Hamilton Borough in 1917. Between 1912 and 1936, Hamilton expanded with new land in Claudelands (1912), Maeroa (1925), and Richmond – modern day Waikato Hospital and northern Melville (1936). Hamilton was proclaimed a city in 1945.

In the latter 19th century, the areas of Te Rapa and Pukete were important sites for the kauri gum trade of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, being some of the southern-most locations where gum could be found.
Beale Cottage is an 1872 listed building in Hamilton East.
===Contemporary history===
From 1985 &quot;MV Waipa Delta&quot; provided excursions along the river through the town centre. In 2009 &quot;Waipa Delta&quot; was moved to provide trips on Waitematā Harbour in Auckland, but replaced by a smaller boat. That too ceased operation and the pontoon at Parana Park was removed in 2013. The &quot;Delta&quot; moved to Taupō in 2012. The former Golden Bay vessel, &quot;Cynthia Dew,&quot; ran 4 days a week on the river from 2012, but was in liquidation in December 2022.
As of 2016, the city continues to grow rapidly. Development is focused on the northern end of the city although in 2012 the council made a decision to balance the city&#x27;s growth by approving an urban development to the south. Traffic congestion is increasing due to population growth, though the council has undertaken many road development projects to try to keep up with the rapid growth. State Highway 1 runs through the western and southern suburbs and has a major junction with State Highway 3 south of the city centre, which contributes to congestion. The Hamilton City Council is building a 2/4-lane arterial road, Wairere Drive, through the northern and eastern suburbs to form a 25 km suburban ring road with State Highway 1, which is due for completion in early 2015, while the New Zealand Transport Agency plans to complete the Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway by 2019, easing congestion taking State Highway 1 out of the city and bypassing it to the east.

The rapid growth of Hamilton has brought with it the side effects of urban sprawl especially to the north east of the city in the Rototuna area. Further development is planned in the Rototuna and Peacocke suburbs. There has been significant development of lifestyle blocks adjacent to the Hamilton Urban Area, in particular Tamahere, and Matangi.

==Geography==

Hamilton&#x27;s geography is largely the result of successive volcanic ash falls, plus debris, which swept down the Waikato River in at least two massive floods, created by ash blocking the outlet of Lake Taupō. In its present form the landscape originated around 20,000 years ago (20 kya), after the Oruanui eruption of the Taupō Volcano. The dates given for the eruption vary. A 2007 study said it was between 22.5 and 14 kya. Another in 2004 put it 26.5 kya. After the eruption Lake Taupō rose to about above the present lake. Around 20 kya. the ash dam eroded and the lake rapidly fell some , creating massive floods. The ash they carried formed the main Hinuera Surface into an alluvial fan of volcanic ash, which extends north of Hamilton and drops about from Karapiro. The Waikato changed its course from flowing into the sea at Thames at about that time, possibly just because sediment built up. The peat lakes and bogs also formed about that time; carbon dating gives maximum ages of 22.5 to 17 kya. Due to an ice age, vegetation was slow to restabilise the ash, so dunes formed up to above the local Hinuera surface. The current Waikato valley had cut into the debris by about 12 kya. and was further modified by the 181 CE Hatepe eruption, when again Lake Taupō level fell , generating a flood, equivalent to 5 years&#x27; normal flow in just a few weeks. About 800 years ago, aggradation began raising the river bed by about .

With the exceptions of the many low hills such as those around the University of Waikato, Hamilton Lake, Beerescourt, Sylvester Road, Pukete, and to the west of the city, and an extensive network of gullies, the terrain of the city is relatively flat. In some areas such as Te Rapa, one old path of an ancient river can be traced. The relatively soft and unconsolidated soil material is still being actively eroded by rain and runoff.
In its natural state, Hamilton and environs was very swampy in winter with 30 small lakes connected to surrounding peatlands. Hamilton was surrounded by 7 large peat bogs such as Komakorau to the North and Rukuhia and Moanatuatua to the South, as well as many smaller ones all of which have now been drained with only small remnants remaining. The total area of peat bog was about 655 km2. Early photos of Hamilton East show carts buried up to their axles in thick mud. Up until the 1880s it was possible to row and drag a dinghy from the city to many outlying farms to the North East. This swampy, damp environment was at the time thought to be an ideal breeding ground for the TB bacillus, which was a major health hazard in the pioneering days. The first Hamilton hospital was constructed on a hill to avoid this problem. One of the reasons why population growth was so slow in Hamilton until the 1920s was the great difficulty in bridging the many arms of the deep swampy gullies that cross the city. Hamilton has 6 major dendritic gully complexes with the 15 km long, 12 branch, Kirikiriroa system being in the north of the city and the southern Mystery creek-Kaipaki gully complex being the largest. Others are Mangakotukutuku, Mangaonua and Waitawhiriwhiri.

In the 1930s, Garden Place Hill, one of the many small hills sometimes referred to as the Hamilton Hills, was removed by unemployed workers working with picks and shovels and model T Ford trucks. The Western remains of the hill are retained by a large concrete wall. The original hill ran from the present Wintec site eastwards to the old post office (now casino). The earth was taken 4 km north to partly fill the Maeroa gully adjacent to the Central Baptist Church on Ulster Street, the main road heading north.

Lake Rotoroa (Hamilton Lake) began forming about 20,000 years ago (20 kya). Originally it was part of an ancient river system that was cut off by deposition material and became two small lakes divided by a narrow peninsula. With higher rainfall and drainage from the extensive peat land to the west, the water level rose so the narrow peninsula was drowned so forming one larger lake. To the north the lake is 8 m deep and in the southern (hospital) end 6 m deep. The old dividing peninsula, the start of which is still visible above water on the eastern side, is only 2 m below the surface. Lake Rotoroa offers a diverse range of recreational activities, including walking trails, picnic areas, and water sports, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists. The well-maintained paths around the lake are ideal for jogging, walking, and cycling. These trails offer stunning views of the lake and surrounding landscapes, providing a tranquil setting for exercise enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.

===Climate===
Hamilton&#x27;s climate is oceanic (Köppen: Cfb ), with highly moderated temperatures due to New Zealand&#x27;s location surrounded by ocean. As the largest inland city in the country, winters are cool and mornings can feature the lowest temperatures of the North Island&#x27;s main centres, dropping as low as several times per year, experiencing on average 17.1 nights that drop below freezing. Nighttime temperatures are even cooler outside of the city. Likewise, summers can be some of the warmest in the country with on average 51.6 days with temperatures exceeding . Hamilton also features very high humidity (similar to tropical climates such as Singapore) which can make temperatures feel much higher or lower than they are.
Ground frosts are common and snow is possible but rare. The only recorded snowfall in modern times was light snowflakes in mid-August 2011 during a prolonged cold period that saw snowfall as far north as Dargaville.

Hamilton receives considerable precipitation amounting to around 1,100 mm over 125 days per year. This coupled with annual sunshine hours of around 2,000 makes Hamilton and the surrounding Waikato an extremely fertile region.

Typically summers are dry and winters are wet. Fog is common during winter mornings, especially close to the Waikato River which runs through the city centre. Hamilton is one of the foggiest cities on earth, however, fog usually burns off by noon to produce sunny and calm winter days.

Hamilton also has the lowest average wind speed of New Zealand&#x27;s main centres as a result of its inland location, in a depression surrounded by high hills and mountains.

==Demographics==
Hamilton had a population of 174,741 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 13,830 people (8.6%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 33,129 people (23.4%) since the 2013 census. There were 85,437 males, 88,497 females and 807 people of other genders in 60,897 dwellings. 3.9% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 33.2 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally).

The median income was $42,200, compared with $41,500 nationally. 13,599 people (9.8%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 72,741 (52.6%) people were employed full-time, 16,971 (12.3%) were part-time, and 5,346 (3.9%) were unemployed.

The main area of population growth is in the Flagstaff-Rototuna area. With its large tertiary student population at Wintec and Waikato University, approximately 40,000 tertiary students, Hamilton has a significant transient population. Hamilton is the second fastest growing population centre after Auckland.

==Government and politics==

===Local government===
Hamilton is located in the administrative area of the Hamilton City Council. The current mayor of Hamilton is Paula Southgate, who was first elected to the position in 2019 and re-elected in 2022. The current deputy mayor is Angela O&#x27;Leary.

Hamilton City is itself part of the Waikato region, controlled administratively by the Waikato Regional Council.

====Coat of arms====
The city&#x27;s coat of arms has received some criticism, being accused of not reflecting the history and diversity of the city, with suggestions that it should be changed.

===Central government===
Hamilton has three electorate MPs in the New Zealand Parliament. Both Hamilton East and Hamilton West electorates are considered bellwether seats.

The electorates are currently represented by:

&quot;General electorates:&quot;
* Hamilton East: Ryan Hamilton (National)
* Hamilton West: Tama Potaka (National)

&quot;Māori electorate:&quot;
* Hauraki-Waikato: Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke (Maori Party).

==Economy==

Education and research are important to the city—Hamilton is home to two institutes of higher education, the University of Waikato and the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec). Research at the Ruakura research centres have been responsible for much of New Zealand&#x27;s innovation in agriculture. Hamilton&#x27;s main revenue source is the dairy industry, due to its location in the centre of New Zealand&#x27;s largest dairying area.

Hamilton annually hosts the National Agricultural Fieldays at Mystery Creek, the southern hemisphere&#x27;s biggest agricultural trade exhibition. Mystery Creek is the country&#x27;s largest event centre and hosts other events of national importance, such as Parachute Christian Music Festival, the National Car Show and the National Boat Show.

Manufacturing and retail are also important to the local economy, as is the provision of health services through the Waikato Hospital. The city is home to New Zealand&#x27;s largest aircraft manufacturer, Pacific Aerospace, which manufactured its 1,000th aircraft in August 2009, and previously Micro Aviation NZ which manufactured and exported high-quality microlight aircraft. It also has its largest concentration of trailer-boat manufacturers such as Buccaneer. Hamilton is also the home of Gallagher Group Ltd, a manufacturer and exporter of electric fencing and security systems. Employing 600 people Gallagher has been doing business in Hamilton since 1938. Hamilton is also home to Vickers Aircraft Company, a startup aircraft manufacturer making a carbon fibre amphibious aircraft called the Wave.

Recent years have seen the firm establishment of the New Zealand base of the British flight training organisation L3. L3 trains over 350 airline pilots a year at its crew training centre at Hamilton Airport.

Tainui Group Holdings Ltd, the commercial arm of the Waikato tribe, is one of Hamilton&#x27;s largest property developers. The Waikato tribe is one of the city&#x27;s largest landowners. Tainui owns land at The Base, Centre Place, The Warehouse Central, University of Waikato, Wintec, the Courthouse, Fairfield College, and the Ruakura AgResearch centre. The Waikato tribe is a major shareholder of the Novotel Tainui and the Hotel Ibis.

It has developed the large retail centre The Base in the old Te Rapa airforce base site which was returned to Tainui, following confiscation in the 1860s, as part of a 1995 Treaty of Waitangi settlement. In mid-2010, The Base was further expanded with Te Awa Mall complex stage 1. Many large retailers such as Farmers and other nationwide speciality chains have located at Te Awa. In 2011 a further stage was opened, with cinemas, restaurants, shops and an underground carpark.

The city&#x27;s three major covered shopping malls are &quot;Centre Place&quot; (formerly &quot;Downtown Plaza&quot;) in the CBD, &quot;Chartwell Shopping Centre&quot; and most recently &quot;Te Awa&quot; at &quot;The Base&quot;. After Farmers Hamilton moves from its existing site on corner of Alexandra and Collingwood streets into the redeveloped Centre Place in late 2013, each major mall will have the department store as an anchor tenant.

The western suburb of Frankton is home to a smaller shopping centre and long-standing local furniture and home department store &quot;Forlongs&quot;. There are many other small suburban shopping centres or plazas, often centred on a New World or Countdown supermarket, such as in Rototuna, Hillcrest and Glenview.

==Culture==

In 2004, Hamilton City Council honoured former resident Richard O&#x27;Brien with a life-size bronze statue of him as character Riff Raff, of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, in his space suit. The statue was designed by Wētā Workshop, props makers for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films. It stands on the former site of the Embassy Cinema, where O&#x27;Brien watched science fiction-double features.

Several Māori Pa have been part restored at Pukete, Hikuwai and Miropiko along the banks of the Waikato River.

The city is host to a large number of small galleries and the Waikato Museum. The latter includes Te Winika, one of the best-preserved waka taua (Māori war canoe) from the pre-colonisation era. It is also home to one of the country&#x27;s premier experimental black box theatres, The Meteor Theatre.

===Music===
Hamilton is host to several large scale music festivals including the Soundscape music festival, which is one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest street parties.

Seddon Park (formerly Westpac Park) is Hamilton&#x27;s main cricket venue and hosts Test matches, One Day Internationals and T20 Internationals. It is the home ground of the Northern Districts Cricket Association.

Hamilton is fast becoming a motorsport venue as well. A round of the WRC was held in 2006 and the annual V8 Supercars race on a street circuit started in 2008 and ended in 2012.

Rugby league is also played in Hamilton with the two local teams, Hamilton City Tigers and Hamilton Hornets/College Old Boys, playing in the Premier Division of the Waikato Rugby League.

Sailing takes place on Hamilton lake for 9 months of the year. The Hamilton Yacht Club has its clubrooms, slipway and ramp on the western side of Lake Rotoroa. Motor boats are not allowed on the lake, with an exception of the Yacht Club rescue boats.

Each year in April, Hamilton supports the &#x27;5 Bridges&#x27; swimming challenge. The course starts in Hamilton Gardens, and continues for 6 kilometres finishing at Ann St Beach. The swim is assisted by the current, with the full distance typically covered in under an hour. The event celebrated its 71st year on 11 April 2010.

==Media==
The major daily newspaper is the &quot;Waikato Times&quot;. Weekly community newspapers include the &quot;Hamilton Press&quot;, &quot;Hamilton News&quot; and Waikato University student magazine &quot;Nexus&quot;.

Local radio stations include The Breeze, Free FM, More FM, Contact FM. The Edge and The Rock, two of New Zealand&#x27;s most popular radio stations, were originally based in Hamilton.

==City facilities and attractions==
Hamilton Gardens is the region&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction and hosts the Hamilton Gardens Summer Festival each year. The Base is New Zealand&#x27;s second largest shopping centre, with over 7.5 million visitors per year to the 190 stores. Te Awa, an enclosed speciality retail mall at The Base, was awarded a silver medal by the International Council of Shopping Centres for the second-best expansion in the Asia Pacific region.

Other local attractions include Hamilton Zoo, the Waikato Museum, the Hamilton Astronomical Society Observatory, the Arts Post art gallery, and the SkyCity casino. Just 20 minutes&#x27; drive away is Ngāruawāhia, the location of Turangawaewae Marae and the home of Māori Queen Nga Wai Hono i te Po.

Hamilton has six public libraries located throughout the city with the Central Library housing the main reference and heritage collection. Hamilton City Theaters provides professional venue and event management at two of the three theatrical venues in the city: Founders Theatre (closed since 2016), and Clarence St Theater. The Meteor theatre was bought by the One Victoria Trust in 2013 after the Hamilton City Council proposed the sale of the theatre and is now privately operated.

St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, built in 1916, is the Anglican cathedral in Hamilton, on Cathedral Hill at the southern end of Victoria Street. There is also St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic cathedral on the opposite side of the river.

The Hamilton New Zealand Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is located in Temple View, Hamilton. It was opened along with the Church College of New Zealand, a large high school owned by the church, in the late 1950s. Both the college and the temple were built by labour missionaries. The school was closed in December 2009. Every year, the temple hosts a large Christmas lighting show which attracts large crowds from all over the country.

==Hospitals==

Hamilton&#x27;s public hospital is Waikato Hospital with 600 beds, 22 operating theatres and about 5,000 worked there in 2014 It is the fourth largest public hospital in New Zealand in number of beds. There are two other major private hospitals in Hamilton City; Braemar Hospital, located in the same area that Waikato Hospital is located, and Southern Cross Hospital, located in Hamilton East. Hamilton also has a two private primary maternity hospitals, which are fully funded by the Waikato District Health Board, Waterford Birth Centre and River Ridge East Birth Centre.

==Transport==
The New Zealand Household Travel Survey 2015 – 2018 said that 86% of Hamilton trip legs were made by car (60% as driver, 26% as passenger), 10% were walking, 2% cycling and 1% by bus.

===Air===
Hamilton Airport serves as a domestic airport. It is jointly owned by Hamilton City and neighbouring district councils. The airport is located just outside Hamilton&#x27;s boundary, within the Waipa District. There are direct flights with Air New Zealand to Christchurch and Wellington and Origin Air to Napier, Nelson and Palmerston North. Sunair served Hamilton for 30 years until it withdrew due to insufficient demand. also there are charter flights to other destinations throughout the North Island. The airport also served as a major base for now defunct low-cost airlines Freedom Air and Kiwi Air. Virgin Australia offered three international flights a week, to and from Brisbane Airport, Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport and Gold Coast Airport. However, all international flights have now been discontinued, primarily due to a small market.

The airport is the base for pilot training schools and the aircraft manufacturer, Pacific Aerospace, is located at the northern end of the runway.

===Cycling===
Hamilton has of on-road, of off-road and of riverside cycleways, which link the city centre with the outlying suburbs. These cycleways consist of a mixture of dedicated cycle lanes, which are 1-metre-wide strips either coloured green or with a painted outline of a cycle and mixed use cycle/walk ways which are mainly located alongside the Waikato River. The city&#x27;s design guide says the preferred width for cycleways is . A cycleway was built beside Greenwood Street and Kahikatea Drive in 2015 and beside Ohaupo Road and Normandy Avenue in 2016. A $6.7m, Western Rail Trail opened in 2017 linking Glenview, Melville, and Deanwell, Hamilton Girls’ High School, Wintec and the city centre.

===Road===
One of New Zealand&#x27;s main road artery State Highway 1C runs through several of Hamilton&#x27;s suburbs and connects with State Highway 3 at a major intersection within the city boundaries. The Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway, which was completed in 2022 shifted State Highway 1 to the east of Hamilton City, effectively bypassing the city and easing congestion between commuting city traffic and through traffic. It will also, as expressed in a City Council report, &quot;undermine the attractiveness of public transport as a mode of choice for many years to come.&quot;

Safer Speed Areas 40 km/h limits were first introduced in Hamilton in 2011 and by 2014 there were 36 of them, many in suburbs near the river.

From 1864 Hamilton was on the Great South Road, created to connect Auckland to Te Awamutu and facilitate the invasion of the Waikato.

==== Ring Road ====
As well as being bypassed by the Expressway, Hamilton will also have the Ring Road and, prior to those, the city centre was bypassed by Anglesea Street in 1964 and the main road diverted from the north end of Victoria Street onto Ulster Street, which was extended to absorb Gurnell Avenue and form a 4-lane main road, by putting Waitewhiriwhiri Stream in a culvert and filling the valley.

The Hamilton Ring Road project was initiated to free some of the city&#x27;s streets from peak-traffic congestion and improve connectivity around the city. It consists of five segments, opening between 1963 and 2024. It was linked to the Te Rapa Section of the Waikato Expressway in 2012.

===== Cobham Drive =====
The first part of the ring road, Cobham Drive, from Tristram St to Cambridge Road, was named in 1963 after the Governor-General, Viscount Cobham. It was originally named Southern Outlet. It linked to SH3 along Normandy Drive. Prior to that the junction with SH3 had been at Victoria Street / Bridge Street and SH1 had used Grey Street and Cambridge Road.

===== Greenwood Street and Kahikatea Drive =====
To the west and south, Greenwood Street, which had existed since 1907, was extended south to Kahikatea Drive, which was named in 1971 and opened about 1974.

===== Avalon Drive =====
The next part of the ring road, on the western side, opened when SH1 was diverted from the city centre to run east of the city, through Nawton from 1 July 1992. Norton Road Extension was renamed Avalon Drive. The road was originally built about 1919. Currently this road is quite congested in morning and evening peak-hour however space has been allocated to upgrade the road from its current two lanes to four lanes in the near future.

===== Wairere Drive =====
Wairere Drive forms the north east part of the ring road. Initially it ran from Avalon Drive to River Road at Flagstaff, via Pukete Bridge. The land for it was gazetted in 1995 and the road was on the 1998 map. It had a 70 km/h speed limit. The extension to Hukanui Rd was on the 2009 map. It was then extended from Hukanui Rd to Crosby Rd in 2010, to Ruakura Rd in 2013 and to Cambridge Rd in 2014, when the Pukete Rd to Resolution Dr section was widened from 2 to 4 lanes, and roundabouts replaced with traffic lights, at a cost of $84m. The extension from Hukanui Road to Tramway Road cost $1.5m in 2005/06, plus $3.3m in 2007/08. In 2008, on the budget had been over $14m. The road includes a wide cycleway. Completion is planned for 2022.

Traffic at Pukete Bridge in 2006 was 25,200 vehicles a day. In 2018 it was 38,400. Many sections of Wairere Drive are congested during morning and evening peak-hour traffic. Hamilton City Council removed funding from its 2024-2034 Long Term Plan to widen many sections of the road, which included the construction of new bus priority and transit lanes.

In 2017, it was noted that a drop in passenger numbers on the Orbiter bus correlated with opening of the extension to Cambridge Rd in 2014.

===== Southern Links =====
The final part of the ring road will be the Southern Links, through Peacocke. Construction of the $150m bridge over the Waikato is planned between 2020 and 2023. The plan for the area says, &quot;it is intended that the arterial routes also make provision for alternative modes of transport such as light rail by maintaining corridors.&quot; The sixth National government has promised to build the Southern Links as part of the Roads of National Significance project.

====Bridges====

The six road bridges that cross the river are often the focus of morning and evening traffic delays. The six road bridges within the city are (from north to south):
* Pukete Bridge
* Fairfield Bridge
* Whitiora Bridge
* Claudelands Bridge
* Victoria Bridge
* Cobham Bridge
* Te Ara Pekapeka Bridge

In addition to the road bridges within the city, the Horotiu bridge is located approximately 10 km north of the city centre and the Narrows Bridge approximately 10 km to the south. The Narrows bridge was closed for reconstruction of its piles in September 2010. In Jan 2011 widening of the 1 km approach road Wairere Drive to Pukete bridge began. The bridge was expanded to 4 lanes in early 2013.

The river is also crossed by a rail bridge and a pedestrian bridge:
* Claudelands Rail Bridge
* Pukete – Flagstaff Pedestrian / Sewer Bridge (see Sewage section below)
Funding for a walking and cycling bridge over the Waikato River that would connect Memorial Park to the CBD was re-allocated in Hamilton City Council&#x27;s 2024-2034 Long Term Plan.

==== Buses ====
Hamilton has buses linking the CBD to most of its suburbs. It also has three high-frequency bus services named Orbiter, Comet and the newly created Meteor service. The Orbiter service loops Hamilton City in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions connecting Rotokauri Transport Hub, Rototuna, Chartwell, University, CBD South, Hospital, Dinsdale and Wintec Rotokauri Campus. The Comet service runs north to south and vice-versa connecting the southern suburbs to the Hospital, CBD, Transport Centre, Te Rapa and The Base shopping centre. The Meteor service runs east to west and vice-versa connecting the south-eastern suburbs to the University, Hamilton East, CBD, Transport Centre, western suburbs, Wintec Rotokauri and the Rotokauri Transport Hub. The high frequency buses run every 15 minutes during peak times.

===Rail===

==== Stations ====

Hamilton City has two railway stations, both servicing the Auckland to Waikato train service, Te Huia. The Rotokauri station (also known as the Rotokauri Transport Hub) is located in Rotokauri behind The Base shopping centre in Hamilton North. The main Hamilton station is located in Frankton at the junction of the East Coast Main Trunk line (ECMT) and the North Island Main Trunk line (NIMT). A disused platform on the ECMT lies beneath the CBD.

In 2006, a study was done into a possible re-introduction of daily commuter train services to Auckland and the benefits that might flow from it. The new service, dubbed Te Huia, commenced on 6 April 2021.

==== Freight ====
Hamilton&#x27;s rail network serves as a major hub for the distribution of dairy products to the ports of Auckland and Tauranga. This hub is located on Crawford St, on land that was formerly part of the Te Rapa Marshalling Yard, just north of the locomotive depot. Te Rapa is at the northern end of the 25 kV AC 50 Hz electrification between Hamilton and Palmerston North.

==== Preserved stock ====
Hamilton also has two locomotives on display:
* NZR F class 230 was donated by Ellis &amp; Burnand, the central North Island sawmillers, in 1956 for static display. Formerly used as the yard engine at their Mangapehi sawmill, it was placed on display at Lake Rotoroa and its boiler filled with concrete. This engine has become a 0-4-2ST in later years following the loss of her rear coupling rod.
* NZR DSA 230 (TMS DSA359), a 0-6-0DM diesel shunting locomotive built by English Electric for the Drewry Car Company, was withdrawn in 1986 and placed on display at Frankton minus its Gardner 8L3 diesel engine and transmission. It was moved in the early 2000s with its shelter to Minogue Park, where it was united with an open seating wagon built on the underframe of wagon W 960, built in 1946 and converted to Way &amp; Works wagon E 7784 in April 1966.

====The railway settlement====
From the arrival of the railway in Hamilton, Frankton was a railway town. In 1923, the suburb became even more railway-orientated when the Frankton Junction Railway House Factory opened, producing the famous George Troup designed railway houses sent to many North Island railway settlements, which are now sought-after pieces of real estate. Its 60 workers produced almost 1400 pre-fabricated railway houses at a peak rate of 400 a year, using rimu and matai from the railway&#x27;s central North Island forests. When, in 1926, government cuts reduced the need for railway houses, the factory also started to supply houses for local councils. Those supplied to Lower Hutt were claimed to be £500 cheaper than comparable houses. The sawmill also produced everything else such as signal masts and boxes, bridges, sleepers, and even furniture for railway stations. It was too efficient for private builders, who got the housing factory closed in 1929. When it finally closed in the 1990s it was very dilapidated, but NZHPT supported restoration of the Category 1 historic place, retaining original windows, big sliding doors and the saw-tooth roof. It is now home to a range of businesses.

Frankton also was home to the Way and Works depot, still in operation as the KiwiRail Network depot. This was connected to the main line by a short siding that ran past the factory; this line was last used in 1997 when a shunting locomotive retrieved two flat wagons from the Way and Works depot. 

The railway workers&#x27; community was centred largely around the W&amp;W depot and sawmill, containing some 200 houses and a Railways Social Hall. Many of the houses are still in place, the majority being the classic 90sq2 three-bedroom design used as standard across New Zealand for railway staff.

==Education==

Hamilton is home to more than 40,000 tertiary students, mostly enrolled in one of the city&#x27;s three main tertiary institutes; the University of Waikato, Waikato Institute of Technology and Te Wananga o Aotearoa. The city is also home to 53 schools both private and state-owned.

As well as state and private primary, intermediate and high schools, it also notably includes a number of Kura Kaupapa Māori primary schools offering education in the Māori language.

The city has seven state secondary schools, in a clockwise direction from north: Rototuna High School in Rototuna, Fairfield College in Fairfield, Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School in Hamilton East, Hillcrest High School in Silverdale, Melville High School in Melville, Hamilton Girls&#x27; High School in the central city, and Fraser High School in Nawton. Both Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; High offer boarding facilities. A new state secondary school is opened for the Rototuna area to serve the booming north-eastern corner of the city. The project had been delayed several years as the previous secondary school serving the area, Fairfield College, was below capacity. The new secondary school opened in 2016.

Additionally, Hamilton is home to a number of state-integrated and private schools. There are numerous state-integrated Catholic primary schools throughout the city. Sacred Heart Girls College and St John&#x27;s College are the integrated Catholic high schools, for girls and boys respectively. Southwell School is a private co-educational Anglican primary school. Waikato Diocesan School for Girls is an integrated Anglican high school.&#x27; St Paul&#x27;s Collegiate School is a private high school for boys, also accepting girls from Year 11. All three Anglican schools are boarding and day schools. Hamilton Christian School is a private coeducational nondenominational Christian school for Years 1–13, founded in 1982.

== Utilities ==
Although telegraph came to Hamilton with the 1864 invasion which established the town, it was quite late in developing its gas (1895), water (1903), sewage (1907) and electricity supplies (1913), probably because its population remained low; in 1911 Hamilton&#x27;s population was 3,542 and Frankton&#x27;s 1,113. Optical cables and microwave towers now provide telecommunications links, gas is supplied by pipeline from Taranaki, water from the Waikato River by the Water Treatment Station at Waiora Terrace, sewage flows for treatment at Pukete and electricity is supplied from the national grid. Restrictions are still placed on garden sprinklers in summer and the Pukete sewage works was still not always meeting discharge Resource consent conditions in 2013.

===Telephone===
A telegraph line from Auckland came shortly after the invasion, reaching Whatawhata, Te Awamutu and Cambridge by October 1864. Telephones came to Hamilton from 1882. Hamilton got a telephone exchange in 1904 with 39 subscribers. Hamilton telephones were put on an automatic exchange between 1915 and 1920. From the 1950s Hamilton was linked into the network of microwave towers via the towers at Te Aroha and Te Uku.

===Gas===
Auckland Gas Company had been set up in 1862, but it wasn&#x27;t until the Hamilton Gasworks Act 1895 that Henry Atkinson (son of the manager of Auckland gasworks) was allowed to set up a gasworks in Clarence St on allotment 322 (see photo of the ) and put gas pipes under the streets. Work started on laying about 50 tons of pipes in July 1895. It also allowed the city to purchase after 12 years at a price determined by arbitration. A 1907 referendum authorised the city council to take over the gasworks. In 1911 the Privy Council set the purchase price at £34,402/14/3d ($5.7m at 2017 prices), half of which was for goodwill.

A gasholder was authorised in 1911. In 1913 the works was expanded and mains laid over the railway bridge into Hamilton East and along Ohaupo Rd.

As well as gas, coke, tar and tar paint were produced. Additions were made to the works as late as 1961. Waikato coal was mixed with coal shipped via Greymouth and Raglan from 1964 until 25 March 1970, when Hamilton switched to natural gas and the gasworks closed. The site was cleaned up after demolition in the 1990s, but is still monitored by Regional Council for contamination.

Hamilton was one of the original nine towns and cities in the North Island to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field enters production in 1970. Gas from the Kapuni field in south Taranaki was transported north via a 373 km long, 200 mm diameter pipeline to Papakura in south Auckland, with Hamilton supplied via an offtake at Temple View.

===Water===
By 1890 complaints were being made of a shortage of water in the wells and tanks. In 1902, a poll of ratepayers approved borrowing £5,000 to set up a water supply. In 1903 of pipes supplied water to 80 properties in Victoria, Anglesea, Collingwood, Clarence and Selkirk streets and the borough turncock reported average use at a day (average consumption is now a day). By 1908 nearly all of Hamilton West had piped water, extended to Frankton and Claudelands in 1912. A contract to pump the water into a tower was let in 1912. By 1916 a water tower on Lake Rd had been built to give extra pressure, mainly for the Fire Brigade whose station opened in 1917. Use was reported as in the month of August 1918. In 1931 the system was upgraded, with larger pipes and an tower on Ruakiwi Rd, holding . Until 1939 on Sundays visitors could climb the tower for 6d. The old tower remained until 1966. A treatment works was built in 1923, using candy filters and supplying water at 75psi.

The 1930 Hillsborough Terrace Water Treatment Station had a maximum continuous capacity slightly over 30 megalitres per day (ML/d). By 1970 peak demands exceeded 45 ML/d with the average annual daily demand being around 25 ML/d, but the site was too small to expand. So Waiora Terrace Station, Glenview (opposite Hamilton Gardens), was commissioned in mid 1971. It was designed for a maximum capacity of 65 ML/d, expandable to 190 ML/d, was increased to approximately 85ML/d with the addition of polymer dosing in the 1980s and by 2010 had a capacity of 106 ML/d. It was built to a Patterson Candy design with coagulation, rapid sand gravity filtration and chlorine gas disinfection.

Chlorine is added at 0.3 ppm and fluoride has been added since 1966, though with a brief withdrawal in 2013/14 and referendums supporting it in 2006 and 2013. The river water has 0.2 to 0.4 ppm fluoride which is increased to around 0.75ppm through the station. Arsenic in the Waikato River is also monitored. It can be about 3 times above the WHO limit, but treatment effects a 5-fold reduction to a level which meets the standards.

From river level the water is pumped up to 8 reservoirs, which uses 410 kWh of power for each million litres of water pumped. To cope with river levels below the intake pipes, a floating pumping platform was installed in 2016. It can pump up to 70 million litres a day. Average use in 2010 was 224 litres per day per person. The 2006 population was 129,249, so total annual consumption was a bit over 10,000 million litres, using over 4 million kWh. A Hamilton City map shows the location of water, stormwater and sewage infrastructure and a description of the water distribution system is in this 2001 HCC Strategic Planning document.

==== Reservoirs ====
A 24 million litre reservoir opened at Kay Road in north Rototuna in 2017, providing Hamilton&#x27;s ninth reservoir, the others being at Dinsdale (2), Fairfield, Hillcrest, Maeroa, Pukete and, as above, at Ruakiwi. A 12 million litre reservoir will be added at Ruakura in 2020.

===Sewage===
Sewage long lagged behind other utilities. Initially sections were large enough for septic tanks to work as well as they could in peatlands, but it wasn&#x27;t long before the 1882 drainage scheme was used for sewage connections. By 1904 complaints were being made about the blocked insanitary drain between Victoria and Anglesea Streets, resulting in a faltering start on a night soil service. The 1907 referendum, which approved purchase of the gasworks also agreed to raise a loan for sewage pipes (though rejected a plan for a steam tram). In 1917 Mayor Ellis rejected the Health Minister&#x27;s suggestion, saying it was impossible to afford a sewage farm. By 1919 only about a third of the city had sewers, but between 1923 and 1925 &quot;considerable progress&quot; was made and sewage reticulation was further extended in 1933. However, there was a sewage related epidemic in Melville in 1940 and Melville, Fairfield and Hillcrest were added to the sewer network from 1949. Although by 1956 80% of Hamilton had sewage pipes, it was only piped to 14 septic tanks (17 when replaced in 1976), which were emptied several times a year, either into the Waitawhirwhiri Stream, or directly into the Waikato. In 1956 the Pollution Advisory Council said, &quot;the daily flow of sewage effluent and trade wastes from Hamilton City is three million gallons… in effect, partly digested sludge and raw sewage is being disposed of into the Waikato River&quot;. Downstream from Hamilton contaminants increased 10 times between the 1950s and the early 1970s. The 1953 Water Pollution Act set up a Pollution Advisory Council, but it had no control powers until 1963.

In 1964, the Department of Health ordered adequate treatment for the sewage. Steven and Fitzmaurice, Consulting Engineers, presented a plan to Council early in 1966. There was some work on piping new areas in 1966, but work on the major trunks and interceptors didn&#x27;t start until 1969 and building at Pukete sewage works started in January 1972. The first sewage was treated in July 1975 and was fully connected early in 1977.

The trunk lines needed a bridge, about above the Waikato, another prestressed concrete box girder bridge over Kirikiriroa Stream at Tauhara Gully and 2 steel pipe bridges over other gullies. The River bridge was designed by Murray-North Partners and the others by council engineers.

The Pukete sewage works cost $12.5m ($160m at 2015 prices). It now cleans /day, which is aerated for about 2 hours in a sedimentation tank, disinfected with chlorine, dechlorinated with sulphur dioxide and discharged into the Waikato through a diffuser outfall on the river bed.

CH2M Beca, successor to the previous engineers, upgraded the plant from 1998 to 2002 to improve nitrogen, BOD and suspended solids levels, with a change from chlorination to UV treatment and biogas and natural gas cogeneration units, able to power the treatment processes and export surplus to the grid.

A further 5 year upgrade started about 2009 expanding and improving the plant, including phosphorus removal.

Despite the improvements there have been on-going problems. In 2012 the council was prosecuted for a sewage sludge spill and consent conditions were breached in 2013 due to a bacterial problem. In 2014 up to of untreated sewage got into the river.

There are also problems with pumping stations. Out of over 130, up to 20 fail each month.

===Electricity===
Hamilton was also late in getting electricity. Reefton had electricity from 1888. Some Hamiltonians had their own dynamos from about 1912, the year the first licence was given for building lines and a generating plant in the Frankton Town Board area. It cost over £8,000 (about $1.3m in 2017 prices) for the initial network, powered by two DC Brush generators in Kent St, driven by two 4-cylinder suction gas engines (suction gas engines used low pressure gas from coal), which started on 23 April 1913 (officially opened by Prime Minister Massey on 4 June). Lighting was provided for streets, houses and the Empire Hotel in Frankton, initially only from 7.30am to 5pm, using a labourer, a meter reader and two linesmen. Electricity was sold at 10d (2015 equivalent $15) per kWh. The first Chief Electrical Engineer was Mr A Beale, followed by Lloyd Mandeno, (1913–1916) and Israel (Jack) Webster, who stayed for nearly 40 years. From May 1916, Hamilton was connected and, in 1917, the supply area was widened to a 5-mile radius and an and then two more sets were added at Kent St. Despite this, by 1920, Frankton was unable to cope with demand. The mayor, P H Watts, proposed buying a second-hand steam plant for £17,000, but it was rejected at a poll on 23 April 1920. The mayor, 6 councillors and the electricity staff all resigned.

The problem was resolved by a link to Horahora Power Station completed, like Frankton, in 1913. In 1919 it was bought by the government and, by 1921, an 11 kV AC line linked it to Hamilton., allowing the &quot;noisy, smoky&quot;, Kent St power station to close in July 1922, by which time it was rated at 170 kW.

There were over 1,500 connections in Hamilton by 1923. Undergrounding began in 1926, when the 11 kV cable was extended from Peachgrove Rd to Seddon Rd sub-station. By 1928 the council had 3,381 consumers and charges were down to 6d per kWh for lighting and 2d per kWh for power and heating. By 1935 4,458 were connected, with of line and lighting was down another penny. By 1950, the 11 kV rings in Hamilton East and Claudelands were finished. Soon afterwards mercury vapor street lighting was installed in London Street and Norton Rd. 33kV gas- and oil-filled cables were laid from 1960 and switched on in April 1974. By 1987 there were 12,247 connections, of line and charges down to 6.577c/kWh (about 13c in 2015 prices). In 2015 prices varied from 11.31 to 22.92 cents per kWh.

Legislation in 1988 amalgamated the Central Waikato Electric Power Board with Hamilton&#x27;s Electricity Division from April 1989 as Waikato Electricity Limited, now known as WEL Networks, one of the distribution companies.

Hamilton now has a 220kV link to the National Grid and Transpower provides for a peak load of 187MW, expected to rise to 216MW by 2030.

<doc id="86655" wikidata="Q170842" url="?curid=86655" title="Sergei Korolev">
<text>Sergei Pavlovich Korolev (14 January 1966) was the lead Soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft designer during the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s. He invented the R-7 Rocket, Sputnik 1, and was involved in the launching of Laika, Sputnik 3, the first human-made object to make contact with another celestial body, Belka and Strelka, the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into space, Voskhod 1, and the first person, Alexei Leonov, to conduct a spacewalk.

Although Korolev trained as an aircraft designer, his greatest strengths proved to be in design integration, organization and strategic planning. Arrested on a false official charge as a &quot;member of an anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary organization&quot; (which would later be reduced to &quot;saboteur of military technology&quot;), he was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six years, including a few months in a Kolyma labour camp. Following his release he became a recognized rocket designer and the key figure in the development of the Soviet Intercontinental ballistic missile program. He later directed the Soviet space program and was made a Member of Soviet Academy of Sciences, overseeing the early successes of the Sputnik and Vostok projects including the first human Earth orbit mission by Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. Korolev&#x27;s unexpected death in 1966 interrupted implementation of his plans for a Soviet crewed Moon landing before the United States 1969 mission.

Before his death he was officially identified only as &quot;glavny konstruktor&quot; (), or the &quot;Chief Designer&quot;, to protect him from possible Cold War assassination attempts by the United States. Even some of the cosmonauts who worked with him were unaware of his last name; he only went by &quot;Chief Designer.&quot; Only following his death in 1966 was his identity revealed, and he received the appropriate public recognition as the driving force behind Soviet accomplishments in space exploration during and following the International Geophysical Year.

==Early life==
Korolev was born in the city of Zhytomyr, the capital of Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). His father, Pavel Yakovlevich Korolev, was born in Mogilev to a Russian soldier and a Belarusian mother.

His mother, Maria Nikolaevna Koroleva (Moskalenko/Bulanina), was a daughter of a wealthy merchant from the city of Nizhyn, with Ukrainian, Greek and Polish heritage.

His father moved to Zhytomyr to be a teacher of the Russian language. Three years after Sergei&#x27;s birth the couple separated due to financial difficulties. Although Pavel later wrote to Maria requesting a meeting with his son, Sergei was told by his mother that his father had allegedly died. Sergei never saw his father after the family break-up, and Pavel died in 1929 before his son learned the truth.

Korolev grew up in Nizhyn, under the care of his maternal grandparents Nikolay Yakovlevich Moskalenko who was a trader of the Second Guild and Maria Matveevna Moskalenko (née Fursa), a daughter of a local cossack. Korolev&#x27;s mother also had a sister Anna and two brothers Yuri and Vasily. Maria Koroleva was frequently away attending Women&#x27;s higher education courses in Kiev, so Sergei was often by himself and grew up a lonely child with few friends. In 1914 World War 1 commenced with social unrest in the Kiev area. No one had time for the seven year old Korolev during this period and he was noted as being stubborn, persistent, and argumentative. Korolev began reading at an early age from his grandfather&#x27;s newspapers, and his pre-school teacher noted he had an excellent memory with abilities in mathematics, reading and writing. His mother divorced Pavel in 1915 and in 1916 married Grigory Mikhailovich Balanin, an electrical engineer who had been educated in Germany but who had to attend the Kiev Polytechnic University because German engineering diplomas were not recognized in Russia. Grigory was an excellent step-father, positively influencing Korolev&#x27;s manners and study habits. After getting a job with the regional railway, Grigory moved the family to Odessa in 1917, where they endured hardships with many other families through the tumultuous years following the Russian Revolution and continuing internecine struggles until the Bolsheviks assumed unchallenged power in 1920. Local schools were closed and young Korolev had to continue his studies at home, where he suffered from a bout of typhus during the severe food shortages of 1919.

==Education==

Korolev received vocational training in carpentry and academics at the Odessa Building Trades School (Stroyprofshkola No. 1). Enjoyment of a 1913 air show inspired interest in aeronautical engineering. He made an independent study of flight theory, and worked at the local glider club. A detachment of military seaplanes had been stationed in Odessa, and Korolev took a keen interest in their operations.
In 1923 he joined the Society of Aviation and Aerial Navigation of Ukraine and the Crimea (OAVUK). He had his first flying lesson after joining the Odessa hydroplane squadron and had many opportunities to fly as a passenger. In 1924 he designed an OAVUK construction project glider called the K-5 when he was 17 years old. He briefly trained in gymnastics until his academic work suffered. Korolev hoped to attend the Zhukovsky Academy in Moscow, but he did not meet the academy&#x27;s standards. He attended the Kiev Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s aviation branch in 1924 while living with his uncle Yuri, and earned money for his courses by doing odd jobs. His curriculum included engineering, physics and mathematics classes. He met and became attracted to a classmate, Xenia Vincentini, who would later become his first wife. In 1925 he was accepted into a limited class on glider construction, and suffered two broken ribs flying the training glider they built. He continued courses at Kiev until he was accepted into the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MVTU, BMSTU) in July 1926, having the famous aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev as his mentor, who was a professor there.

Korolev studied specialized aviation topics until 1929, while living with his family in the typically crowded conditions of Moscow. Korolev enjoyed opportunities to fly gliders and powered aircraft during this part of his education. He designed a glider in 1928, and flew it in a competition the next year. The Communist Party accelerated the education of engineers in 1929 to meet the country&#x27;s urgent need for their skills. Korolev obtained a diploma by producing a practical aircraft design by the end of the year.

==Early career==

After graduation, Korolev worked with some of the best Soviet designers at the 4th Experimental Section aircraft design bureau OPO-4 headed by who emigrated to the USSR from France in the 1920s. He did not stand out in this group, but while so employed he also worked independently to design a glider capable of performing aerobatics. In 1930 he became interested in the possibilities of liquid-fueled rocket engines to propel airplanes, while working at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) as a lead engineer on the Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. Korolev earned his pilot&#x27;s license in 1930 and explored the operational limits of the aircraft he piloted, wondering what was beyond his plane&#x27;s altitude limit and how he could get there. Many believe this was the start of his interest in space.

Korolev married Xenia Vincentini on 6 August 1931. He had first proposed marriage to her in 1924, but she then declined so she might continue her higher education. In 1931, Korolev and space travel enthusiast Friedrich Zander participated in the creation of the Group for the Study of Reactive Motion (GIRD), one of the earliest state-sponsored centers for rocket development in the USSR. While there, he met Mikhail Tikhonravov, a glider pilot and aerospace engineer who would later work under Korolev&#x27;s Sputnik group. In May 1932 Korolev was appointed chief of the group; and military interest encouraged funding of group projects. On August 18, 1933, GIRD launched the first hybrid propellant rocket, the GIRD-09, and on November 25, 1933, the Soviet&#x27;s first liquid-fueled rocket GIRD-X.

Growing military interest in this new technology caused GIRD to be merged with the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) at Leningrad in 1933 to create the Reactive Scientific Research Institute (RNII), which brought together the best of the Soviet rocket talent, including Korolev, Georgy Langemak, and former GDL engine designer Valentin Glushko. Korolev was appointed deputy head under Ivan Kleymyonov, however in 1934, following a disagreement over the direction of RNII, Korolev was demoted to section chief of winged missiles and was replaced by Georgy Langemak. Korolev supervised development of cruise missiles and a crewed rocket-powered glider. &quot;Rocket Flight in Stratosphere&quot; was published by Korolev in 1934. On 10 April 1935, Korolev&#x27;s wife gave birth to their daughter, Natalya; and they moved out of Sergei&#x27;s parents&#x27; home and into their own apartment in 1936. Both Korolev and his wife had careers, and Sergei always spent long hours at his design office.

==Imprisonment==
Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge severely damaged RNII, with Director Kleymyonov and Chief Engineer Langemak arrested in November 1937, tortured, made to sign false confessions and executed in January 1938. Glushko was arrested in March 1938 and with many other leading engineers was imprisoned in the Gulag. Korolev was arrested by the NKVD on 27 June 1938 after being accused of a variety of charges, including false charges extracted from Kleymyonov, Langemak and Glushko. He was tortured in the Lubyanka prison to extract a confession. Glushko and Korolev had reportedly been denounced by Andrei Kostikov who became the head of RNII after its leadership was arrested.

Korolev was sent to prison, where he wrote many appeals to the authorities, including Stalin himself. Following the fall of NKVD head Nikolai Yezhov, the new chief Lavrenti Beria chose to retry Korolev on reduced charges in 1939; but by that time Korolev was on his way from prison to a Gulag forced labour camp in Kolyma in the far east of Siberia, where he spent several months in a gold mine before word reached him of his retrial. Work camp conditions of inadequate food, shelter, and clothing killed thousands of prisoners each month. Korolev sustained injuries, including possibly a heart attack and lost most of his teeth from scurvy before being returned to Moscow in late 1939. When he reached Moscow, Korolev&#x27;s sentence was reduced to eight years. However, due to the intervention by his old mentor, Andrei Tupolev, he was relocated to a prison for scientists and engineers in September 1940. These were labor camps where scientists and engineers worked on projects assigned by the Communist party leadership. The &quot;Central Design Bureau 29&quot; (CKB-29, ЦКБ-29) of the NKVD, served as Tupolev&#x27;s engineering facility, and Korolev was brought here to work. During World War II, this &quot;sharashka&quot; designed both the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber and the Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bomber. The group was moved several times during the war, the first time to avoid capture by advancing German forces. Korolev was moved in 1942 to the &quot;sharashka&quot; of Kazan OKB-16 under Glushko. Korolev and Glushko designed the RD-1 KhZ auxiliary rocket motor tested in an unsuccessful fast-climb Lavochkin La-7R. Korolev was isolated from his family until 27 June 1944 when healong with Tupolev, Glushko and otherswas finally discharged by special government decree, although the charges against him were not dropped until 1957.

Korolev rarely talked about his experience in the Gulag, and lived under constant fear of being executed for the military secrets he possessed. He was deeply affected by his time in the camp, becoming reserved and cautious as a result. He later learned that Glushko was one of his accusers, and this was likely the cause of the lifelong animosity between the two men. The design bureau was handed over from NKVD control to the government&#x27;s aviation industry commission. Korolev continued working with the bureau for another year, serving as deputy designer under Glushko and studying various rocket designs.

Korolev was commissioned into the Red Army with the rank of colonel in 1945; his first military decoration was the Badge of Honor, awarded in 1945 for his work on the development of rocket motors for military aircraft. On 8 September 1945, Korolev was brought to Germany along with many other experts to recover the technology of the German V-2 rocket. The Soviets worked with German specialists to understand and replicate the rocket technology, placing a priority on recreating the entire German V-2 rocket. In February 1946 the Institute Nordhausen was formed, with Korolev as Chief Engineer, Glushko as head of Engine assembly and propulsion systems and German Helmut Gröttrup, who previously worked with Wernher von Braun, as General Director. The work continued in East Germany until late 1946, when 2,000+ German scientists and engineers were sent to the USSR through Operation Osoaviakhim. Most of the German experts, Gröttrup being an exception, had not worked directly with Wernher von Braun. Many of the leading German rocket scientists, including Dr. von Braun himself, surrendered to Americans and were transported to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip.

Stalin made rocket and missile development a national priority upon signing a decree on 13 May 1946, and a new institute called Scientific Research Institute No. 88 (NII-88) was created for that purpose, in the suburbs of Moscow. Development of ballistic missiles was placed under the military control of Dmitriy Ustinov through the decree signed by Stalin, and Ustinov appointed Korolev as chief designer of long-range missiles at Department No. 3 of NII-88. During this period Korolev demonstrated his organisation and management capabilities by organising a &quot;Council of Chief Designers&quot;, which assisted in circumnavigating the bureaucratic hierarchy of the Soviet missile industry. This group eventually assumed engineering control over the early Soviet space program.

Korolev returned from Germany in February 1947 and took up his duties as chief designer and Head of Department No 3 of NII-88, initially tasked with reproduction of the V-2. The Soviets were only able to obtain parts to assemble approximately a dozen V-2 rockets, so the decision was made to replicate a Soviet version, which was designated the R-1. Initially Korolev opposed this decision as he thought it was a waste of time and they should move immediately to manufacture a more advanced version, which had been designated the R-2. However Korolev was overruled and was ordered to assemble what V-2s they had for flight testing, then create the R-1 using Soviet infrastructure and materials. NII-88 also incorporated 170+ German specialistsincluding Helmut Gröttrup and Fritz Karl Preikschat with approximately half based at Branch 1 of NII-88 on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger some from Moscow. The Germans provided a variety of support to the Soviet efforts, particularly on assembling the V-2 and creating the R-1.

The first Soviet tests of V-2 rockets took place in October 1947 at Kapustin Yar, with Korolev as management lead for the project. Numerous German engineers also participated in the tests. A total of 11 V-2 rockets were launched, with 5 reaching their designated targets. In September 1948 testing of the R-1 began at Kapustin Yar, where Korolev was a formal member of the &quot;State Commission for testing the R-1&quot;. No Germans participated in these tests, which launched 9 rockets between September and November 1948.
Korolev continued to lobby for the design and construction of the R-2, including meeting with Stalin in April 1947, but faced competition from a proposal from the Germans, called the G-1. Whilst the German proposal was initially supported by Soviet management, Korolev opposed utilising German specialists for personal reasons and basically ignored their suggestions and advice. Due to political and security concerns, German specialists were not allowed knowledge or access to any Soviet missile design and in December 1948 work on the G-1 proposal was terminated. The Ministry of Defence decided to dissolve the German team in 1950 and repatriated the German engineers and their families between December 1951 and November 1953.

In April 1948 the go ahead for &quot;scientific and experimental work&quot; was approved, which led to the creation of the R-2. The R-2 doubled the range of the V-2, and was the first design to utilize a separable warhead. This was followed by the R-3, which had a range of , and thus could target England.

Glushko couldn&#x27;t obtain the required thrust from the R-3 engines, so the project was canceled in 1952. Korolev joined the Soviet Communist Party that year to request money from the government for future projects including the R-5, with a more modest range. It completed a first successful flight by 1953. The world&#x27;s first true intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was the R-7 Semyorka. This was a two-stage rocket with a maximum payload of 5.4 tons, sufficient to carry the Soviets&#x27; bulky nuclear bomb an impressive distance of . During the summer of 1957, the first three launches of the R-7 all failed, severely demoralizing Korolev and his colleagues. The failures also jeopardized his position and dream of using an R-7 to launch an artificial satellite in the future. The fourth test, completed on 21 August 1957, was finally able to deliver a dummy payload to the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Soviet news agency TASS made a brief announcement about the ICBM&#x27;s success, but it was largely ignored or dismissed by members of the American public and media. Because of Korolev&#x27;s success with the R-7 and because the Soviet Union had successfully created the ICBM before the United States of America, he was nationally recognized by the Soviet Union, although his name was kept secret. However, despite the Soviet R-7 initial success, it experienced later failures as it was not intended to be a practical weapon. On 19 April 1957 Korolev was declared fully &quot;rehabilitated&quot;, as the government acknowledged that his sentence was unjust.

==Space program==
Korolev was keenly aware of the orbital possibilities of the rockets being designed as ICBMs, ideas that were shared by Tikhonravov then working at NII-4. On 26 May 1954, six days after being tasked to lead the R-7 ballistic missile program, Korolev submitted a proposal to use the R-7 to launch a satellite into space, naming a technical report from Tikhonravov and mentioning similar work being carried out by Americans. After receiving lukewarm support from the Soviet leadership, Korolev initiated a modest satellite research project in coordination with Tikhonravov. To intensify his lobbying efforts, Korolev, along with other like-minded engineers, began writing speculative articles for Soviet newspapers on space flight. They were picked up by the press in the United States and the CIA, influencing American authorities to start their own satellite programs. On 29 July 1955, the Eisenhower administration announced the intention of the United States to launch &quot;small Earth-circling satellites&quot; for the International Geophysical Year. While the US government debated the idea of spending millions of dollars on this concept, Korolev suggested the international prestige of launching a satellite before the United States. On 5 August, he sent another proposal with American newspaper articles about the US program attached. Three days later, the Soviet leadership approved his plan. On 30 August, Korolev met with members of the Soviet defense and scientific communities. As a result, he was allowed to use the R-7 rocket to launch satellites, and his project also gained support from the Soviet Academy of Sciences. On 30 January 1956, the USSR Council of Ministers officially approved the satellite project in its decree number 149-88ss.

The original plan for the satellite called for a sophisticated scientific laboratory. Nicknamed &quot;Object D&quot;, it would be the fifth type of payload built for the R-7 missile. Despite earlier work done by Tikhonravov, much of its design, such as pressurized equipment, long-range communications systems, automated switches, and a metal construct to work in space, had little precedent. By mid-1956, Korolev had finalized the modifications to the R-7 ICBM for a satellite launch, but the project as a whole was falling behind schedule. He feared that the United States would launch a satellite before he could. This was heightened by reports of the American Project Vanguard and a secret 1956 missile launch from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida. Meanwhile, testing of the R-7 rocket engine showed that its specific impulse would be lower than projected and thus insufficient for Object D&#x27;s specifications. Korolev sent a revised plan calling for a simpler payload of approximately 100 kilograms. It was approved on 25 January 1957 as &#x27;Object PS&#x27;.

Despite having achieved one successful flight of the R-7 rocket, Korolev still faced opposition from some officials to his plan of launching a satellite. In August 1957, he proposed letting the Central Committee make the call. Because no one wanted to risk losing the prestige to the United States, Korolev&#x27;s satellite launch was finally approved. In September, a second successful flight of the R-7 was made, and 6 October was established as the target date for launching PS-1, the first of the Object PS-type satellites.

The lead designer of Object PS was Mikhail S. Khomyakov, and its deputy designer was Oleg G. Ivanovskiy. It was constructed in less than a month by the Tikhonravov group, while Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace. The satellite was a simple polished metal sphere no bigger than a beach ball, containing batteries that powered a transmitter using four external communication antennas. Korolev moved the launch date two days early, fearing a preemptive launch of their own satellite by the United States. PS-1 was successfully launched into space on 4 October 1957 as Sputnik 1, becoming the first artificial satellite of the Earth.

For security reasons, the names of chief individuals in the Soviet space program became a secret. They were allowed to prepare a report detailing the design and construction of Sputnik 1, however, which was published anonymously by &quot;Pravda&quot; on 9 October. Korolev also began writing other articles under the pseudonym &quot;Professor K. Sergeyev&quot;.

The Soviet government initially had a low-key response to the success of the launch. International reaction was electrifying and tumultuous, however, which the Soviets later capitalized on. Political ramifications of the accomplishment continued for decades. Nikita Khrushchev—initially bored with the idea of another Korolev rocket launch—was pleased with this success after the wide recognition, and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later, in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 3 November.

Korolev and close associate Mstislav Keldysh wished to up the ante of building a second, larger satellite by proposing the idea of putting a dog on board, which sufficiently caught the interest of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. This new Sputnik 2 spacecraft had six times the mass of the Sputnik 1, and carried the dog Laika as a payload. The entire vehicle was designed from scratch within four weeks, with no time for testing or quality checks. It was successfully launched on 3 November and Laika was placed in orbit. There was no mechanism to bring the dog back to Earth; the dog died from heat exhaustion after five hours in space.

The instrument-laden Sputnik 3 spacecraft was launched initially on 27 April 1958, but the satellite had a failure with the engine which caused the satellite to fall back down to Earth in separate pieces. On 15 May 1958, Sputnik 3 was successfully launched into orbit. The tape recorder that was to store the data failed after launch. As a result, the discovery and mapping of the Van Allen radiation belts was left to the United States&#x27; Explorer 3 and Pioneer 3 satellites. Sputnik 3 left little doubt with the American government about the Soviets&#x27; pending ICBM capability.

===The Moon===

Even before the &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; launch, Korolev was interested in getting to the Moon. He came up with the notion to modify the R-7 missile in order to carry a package to the Moon. However, it was not until 1958 that this idea was approved, after Korolev wrote a letter explaining that his current technology would make it possible to get to the Moon. A modified version of the R-7 launch vehicle was used with a new upper stage. The engine for this final stage was the first designed to be fired in outer space. &quot;Mechta&quot; is the Russian word meaning &quot;dream&quot;, and this is the name Korolev called his moon ships. Officially, the Soviet Union called them Lunas. The first three lunar probes launched in 1958 all failed in part because of political pressure forcing the launches to be rushed with an inadequate budget to test and develop the hardware properly before they were ready to fly. Korolev thought political infighting in Moscow was responsible for the lack of sufficient funding for the program, although the US space program at this early phase also had a scarcely enviable launch record. Once, when pressured to beat the US to a working lunar probe, Korolev allegedly exclaimed: &quot;Do you think that only American rockets explode!?&quot; The Luna 1 mission on 2 January 1959 was intended to impact the surface, but missed by about . Nevertheless, this probe became the first to reach escape velocity and the first to go near the Moon, as well as becoming the first man-made object to orbit the Sun. A subsequent attempt (&quot;Luna E-1A No.1&quot;) failed at launch, and then &quot;Luna 2&quot; successfully impacted the surface on 14 September 1959, giving the Soviets another first. This was followed just one month later by an even greater success with &quot;Luna 3&quot;. It was launched only two years after Sputnik 1, and on 7 October 1959 was the first spacecraft to photograph the far side of the Moon, which was something the people of Earth had never seen beforehand.

The Luna missions were intended to make a successful soft landing on the Moon, but Korolev was unable to see a success. &quot;Luna 4&quot; and &quot;Luna 6&quot; both missed, &quot;Luna 5&quot;, &quot;Luna 7&quot;, and &quot;Luna 8&quot; all crashed on the Moon. It was not until after Korolev&#x27;s death that the Soviet Union successfully achieved a soft landing on the Moon with &quot;Luna 9&quot;.

Towards the latter part of Korolev&#x27;s life, he had been working on projects for reaching the planets Mars and Venus, and even had spacecraft ready to reach both. The United States was also working towards reaching these planets, so it was a race to see who would be successful. Korolev&#x27;s two initial Mars probes suffered from engine failures, and the five probes the Soviet Union launched in hopes of reaching Venus all failed between 1961 and 1962, Korolev himself supervised the launches of all probes.

On 1 November 1962, the Soviet Union successfully launched &quot;Mars 1&quot; and although communications failed, was the first to complete a flyby of Mars. Later, the Soviet Union launched &quot;Venera 3&quot;, which was the first impact of Venus. It was not until after Korolev&#x27;s death that the Soviet Union impacted Mars.

Korolev&#x27;s group was also working on ambitious programs for missions to Mars and Venus, putting a man in orbit, launching communication, spy and weather satellites, and making a soft-landing on the Moon. A radio communication center needed to be built in the Crimea, near Simferopol and near Yevpatoria to control the spacecraft. Many of these projects were not realized in his lifetime, and none of the planetary probes performed a completely successful mission until after his death.

===Human spaceflight===

Although he had conceived of the idea as early as 1948, Korolev&#x27;s planning for the piloted mission began in 1958 with design studies for the future Vostok spacecraft. It was to hold a single passenger in a space suit, and be fully automated. The space suit, unlike the United States&#x27; pure oxygen system, was 80 percent nitrogen and only 20 percent oxygen. The capsule had an escape mechanism for problems prior to launch, and a soft-landing and ejection system during the recovery. The spacecraft was spherical, just like the Sputnik design, and Korolev explained his reasoning for this by saying &quot;the spherical shape would be more stable dynamically&quot;. Beginning with work on the Vostok, Konstantin Feoktistov was recruited directly by Korolev to be the principal designer for crewed spaceflight vehicles.

On 15 May 1960 an uncrewed prototype performed 64 orbits of Earth, but the reentry maneuver failed. On 28 July 1960, two dogs by the names of Chaika and Lishichka were launched into space, but the mission was unsuccessful when an explosion killed the dogs. However, on 19 August, the Soviet Union became the first to successfully recover living creatures back to Earth. The dogs, Belka and Strelka were successfully launched into space on a Vostok spacecraft and they completed eighteen orbits. Following this, the Soviet Union sent a total of six dogs into space, two in pairs, and two paired with a dummy. Unfortunately, not all the missions were successful. After gaining approval from the government, a modified version of Korolev&#x27;s R-7 was used to launch Yuri Alexeevich Gagarin into orbit on 12 April 1961, which was before the United States was able to put Alan Shepard into space. Korolev served as capsule coordinator, and was able to speak to Gagarin who was inside the capsule. The first human in space and Earth orbit returned to Earth via a parachute after ejecting at an altitude of . Gagarin was followed by additional Vostok flights, culminating with 81 orbits completed by Vostok 5 and the launch of Valentina Tereshkova as the first woman cosmonaut in space aboard Vostok 6.

Korolev proposed communications satellites and the Vostok craft was a spinoff from the Zenit spy satellite useful for photographic reconnaissance and Vostok had its defense importance acknowledged by the military. Korolev planned to move forward with Soyuz craft able to dock with other craft in orbit and exchange crews. He was directed by Khrushchev to cheaply produce more &#x27;firsts&#x27; for the piloted program, including a multi-crewed flight. Korolev was reported to have resisted the idea as the Vostok was a one-man spacecraft and the three-man Soyuz was several years away from being able to fly. Khrushchev was not interested in technical excuses and let it be known that if Korolev could not do it, he would give the work to his rival, Vladimir Chelomey. But Russian Space Web describes this demand by Khrushchev as a legend and Challenge to Apollo says that the evidence that Khrushchev would have ordered these missions does not survive scrutiny.

Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov described the authority Korolev commanded at this time.

Long before we met him, one man dominated much of our conversation in the early days of our training; Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the mastermind behind the Soviet space program. He was only ever referred to by the initials of his first two names, SP, or by the mysterious title of &quot;Chief Designer&quot;, or simply &quot;Chief&quot;. For those on the space program there was no authority higher. Korolev had the reputation of being a man of the highest integrity, but also of being extremely demanding. Everyone around him was on tenterhooks, afraid of making a wrong move and invoking his wrath. He was treated like a god.
Leonov recalled the first meeting between Korolev and the cosmonauts.

On August 11, 1962, Korolyov launched the first group flight with Vostok 3 and 4 (with Andriyan Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich). The two spacecraft approached each other to 6.5 km. This was based on precise calculations already at launch and not on steering (maneuvering) of the spacecraft. During the flight, at Korolev&#x27;s request, Popovich sang the Ukrainian song &quot;Watching the sky and thinking a thought ...&quot; (Ukrainian Дивлюсь я на небо, та й думку гадаю ..., poem by Mykhailo Petrenko) the first song from outer space.

The Voskhod was designed as an incremental improvement on the Vostok to meet Khruschev&#x27;s goal. As a single capsule would be ineffective for proper travel to the Moon, the vehicle needed to be able to hold more people. Khrushchev ordered Korolev to launch three people on the Voskhod capsule quickly, as the United States was already doing unmanned tests of the 2 person Gemini. Korolev accepted, on the condition that more backing would be given to his N-1 rocket program. One of the difficulties in the design of the Voskhod was the need to land it via parachute. The three-person crew could not bail out and land by parachute. So the craft would need much larger parachutes in order to land safely. Early tests with the craft resulted in some failures until use of stronger fabric improved parachute reliability.

The resulting Voskhod was a stripped-down vehicle from which any excess weight had been removed; although a backup retrofire engine was added, since the more powerful Voskhod rocket used to launch the craft would send it to a higher orbit than the Vostok, eliminating the possibility of a natural decay of the orbit and reentry in case of primary retrorocket failure. After one uncrewed test flight, this spacecraft carried a crew of three cosmonauts, Komarov, Yegorov and Feoktistov, into space on 12 October 1964 and completed sixteen orbits. This craft was designed to perform a soft landing, eliminating a need for the ejection system; but the crew was sent into orbit without space suits or a launch abort system.

With the Americans planning a spacewalk with their Gemini program, the Soviets decided to trump them again by performing a spacewalk on the second Voskhod launch. After rapidly adding an airlock, the Voskhod 2 was launched on 18 March 1965, and Alexei Leonov performed the world&#x27;s first spacewalk. The flight very nearly ended in disaster, as Leonov was just barely able to re-enter through the airlock, and plans for further Voskhod missions were shelved. In the meantime the change of Soviet leadership with the fall of Khrushchev meant that Korolev was back in favor and given charge of beating the US to landing a man on the Moon.

For the Moon race, Korolev&#x27;s staff started to design the immense N1 rocket in 1961, using the NK-15 liquid fuel rocket engine. He also was working on the design for the Soyuz spacecraft that was intended to carry crews to LEO and to the Moon. As well, Korolev was designing the Luna series of vehicles that would soft-land on the Moon and make robotic missions to Mars and Venus. Unexpectedly, he died in January 1966, before he could see his various plans brought to fruition.

====Criticism====

Engineer Sergei Khrushchev, son of former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, explained in an interview some of the shortcomings he discerned in Korolev&#x27;s approach, which in his opinion was why the Soviets didn&#x27;t land on the Moon:
Another reason the Soviet crewed lunar program didn&#x27;t succeed was the rivalry between Korolev and Vladimir Chelomey. Their animosity was due to the intolerable persona of both men, and their desire for leadership at any cost. The two never said a harsh word about each other either in public or in private, but toppled each other&#x27;s projects in any way possible. Instead of dividing competencies and responsibilities and cooperating in order to pursue the same goal, the two struggled for leadership in the space program. According to Khrushchev, who worked for Chelomey and knew both men well, they both would have preferred the Americans to land on the Moon first rather than their rival.

==Death==

On 3 December 1960, Korolev suffered his first heart attack. During his convalescence, it was also discovered that he was suffering from a kidney disorder, a condition brought on by his detention in the Soviet prison camps. He was warned by the doctors that if he continued to work as intensely as he had, he would not live long. Korolev became convinced that Khrushchev was only interested in the space program for its propaganda value and feared that he would cancel it entirely if the Soviets started losing their leadership to the United States, so he continued to push himself.

By 1962, Korolev&#x27;s health problems were beginning to accumulate and he was suffering from numerous ailments. He had a bout of intestinal bleeding that led to him being taken to the hospital in an ambulance. In 1964 doctors diagnosed him with cardiac arrhythmia. In February he spent ten days in the hospital after a heart problem. Shortly after, he was suffering from inflammation of his gallbladder. The mounting pressure of his workload was also taking a heavy toll, and he was suffering from a lot of fatigue. Korolev was also experiencing hearing loss, possibly from repeated exposure to loud rocket-engine tests.

The actual circumstances of Korolev&#x27;s death remain somewhat uncertain. In December 1965, he was supposedly diagnosed with a bleeding polyp in his large intestine. He entered the hospital on 5 January 1966 for somewhat routine surgery, but died nine days later. It was stated by the government that he had what turned out to be a large, cancerous tumor in his abdomen, but Valentin Glushko later reported that he actually died due to a poorly performed operation for hemorrhoids. Another version states that the operation was going well and no one was predicting any complications. Suddenly, during the operation, Korolev started to bleed. Doctors tried to provide intubation to allow him to breathe freely, but his jaws, injured during his time in a Gulag, had not healed properly and impeded the installation of the breathing tube. Korolev died without regaining consciousness. According to Harford, Korolev&#x27;s family confirmed the cancer story. His weak heart contributed to his death during surgery.

Under a policy initiated by Stalin and continued by his successors, the identity of Korolev was not revealed until after his death. The purported reason was to protect him from foreign agents from the United States. As a result, the Soviet people did not become aware of his accomplishments until after his death. His obituary was published in the &quot;Pravda&quot; newspaper on 16 January 1966, showing a photograph of Korolev with all his medals. Korolev&#x27;s ashes were interred with state honors in the Kremlin Wall.

Korolev is comparable to Wernher von Braun as the leading architects of the Space Race. Like von Braun, Korolev had to compete continually with rivals, such as Vladimir Chelomey, who had their own plans for flights to the Moon. Unlike the Americans, he also had to work with technology that in many aspects was less advanced than what was available in the United States, particularly in electronics and computers, and to cope with extreme political pressure.

Korolev&#x27;s successor in the Soviet space program was Vasily Mishin, a quite competent engineer who had served as his deputy and right-hand man. After Korolev died, Mishin became the Chief Designer, and he inherited what turned out to be a flawed N1 rocket program. In 1972, Mishin was fired and then replaced by a rival, Valentin Glushko, after all four N-1 test launches failed. By that time, the rival Americans had already made it to the Moon, and so the program was canceled by CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev.

==Personal life==
The Soviet émigré Leonid Vladimirov related the following description of Korolev by Valentin Glushko at about this time:

Korolev was rarely known to drink alcoholic beverages, and chose to live a fairly austere lifestyle.

His career also contributed to instability in his personal life. About 1946, the marriage of Korolev and Vincentini began to break up. Vincentini was heavily occupied with her own career, and about this time Korolev had an affair with a younger woman named Nina Ivanovna Kotenkova, who was an English interpreter in the Podlipki office. Vincentini, who still loved Korolev and was angry over the infidelity, divorced him in 1948. Korolev and Kotenkova were married in 1949, but he is known to have had affairs even after this second marriage.

Korolev&#x27;s passion for his work was a characteristic that made him a great leader. He was committed to training younger engineers to move into his space and missile projects, even while consumed with his own work. Korolev knew that students would be the future of space exploration, which is why he made such an effort to communicate with them. Arkady Ostashev was one of Korolev&#x27;s students, who Korolev hired to do dissertation work before later becoming an engineer and working on the R-2.

==Awards and honours==

Korolev, an engineer by training, was able to navigate the unpredictable and dangerous Soviet politics of Moscow, secure funding and support of leadership to the cause that was only vaguely defined (space exploration), create a shared vision to sell the idea to an extended set of disparate stakeholders, and create an entirely new segment of science.

Among his awards, Korolev was twice honored as Hero of Socialist Labour, in 1956 and 1961. He was also a Lenin Prize winner in 1971, and was awarded the Order of Lenin three times, the Order of the Badge of Honour and the Medal &quot;For Labour Valour&quot;.

In 1958 he was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1969 and 1986, the USSR issued 10 kopek postage stamps honoring Korolev. In addition he was made an Honorary Citizen of Korolyov and received the Medal &quot;In Commemoration of the 800th Anniversary of Moscow&quot;.

Sergei Khrushchev claimed that his father Nikita rejected a Nobel Prize for Korolev out of concern that the award would anger the rest of the Council of Chief Designers.

In 1990, Korolev was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

===Namesakes===
A street in Moscow was named after Korolev in 1966 and is now called &quot;Ulitsa Akademika Korolyova&quot; (Academician Korolyov Street). &quot;The memorial home-museum of akademician S.P.Korolyov&quot; was established in 1975 in the house where Korolev lived from 1959 till 1966 (Moscow, 6th Ostankinsky Lane,2/28). In 1976 he was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame.
The town of Kaliningrad (historic name &quot;Podlipki&quot;, Moscow region) was renamed Korolev in honour of Korolev in 1996. There is now an oversized statue of Korolev located in the town square. The town is the home of RSC Energia, the largest space company in Russia. RSC Energia was also renamed to S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia in later years.

Astronomical features named after Korolev include the crater Korolev on the far side of the Moon, a crater on Mars, and the asteroid 1855 Korolyov.

Quite a large number of streets exist with his name in Russia as well as in Ukraine. In Zhytomyr on the other side of the street (vulytsia Dmytrivska) from the house where Korolev was born is the .

A visual phenomenon iconic to a type of rocket staging event is named the Korolev cross in honor of Korolev.

Aeroflot named a brand new Boeing 777 after Korolev in 2021.

==Portrayals in fiction==
The first portrayal of Korolev in Soviet cinema was made in the 1972 film &quot;Taming of the Fire&quot;, in which Korolev was played by Kirill Lavrov.

The 2001 story &quot;The Chief Designer&quot; by Andy Duncan is a fictionalized account of Korolev&#x27;s career.

He was played by Steve Nicolson in the 2005 BBC co-produced docudrama &quot;Space Race&quot;.

In 2011 the British writer Rona Munro produced the play &quot;Little Eagles&quot; on Korolev&#x27;s life – its premiere was from 16 April to 7 May 2011, in an RSC production at the Hampstead Theatre, with Korolev played by Darrel D&#x27;Silva and Yuri Gagarin by Dyfan Dwyfor.

He was played by Mikhail Filippov in the 2013 Russian film &quot;&quot;.

He was portrayed by Vladimir Ilyin in the 2017 Russian film &quot;The Age of Pioneers&quot;.

According to Ronald D. Moore, the creator of the alternate history TV series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, the divergence point of the alternate timeline was that Korolev instead survives the surgery in 1966, which leads to the Soviets landing on the moon first. Korolev then also appears in the second season, where he is portrayed by Endre Hules.

<text>Cambio 90 (lit. &quot;Change 90&quot;, C90) was a Peruvian right-wing political party which entered the political spectrum in early 1990, and throughout the 1990s until late-2000 was the most powerful political party in Peru alongside New Majority, serving more as an instrumental electoral vehicle for Alberto Fujimori.

== History ==
&quot;Cambio 90&quot;&#x27;s success hinged largely on the success of its candidate for the presidency, Alberto Fujimori, an agricultural engineer and rector of the Universidad Nacional Agraria (National Agrarian University) in Lima&#x27;s La Molina District from 1984 to 1989. Fujimori&#x27;s appeal to a large extent was his standing as a political outsider.

At the same time, &quot;Cambio&quot;&#x27;s success was also attributed largely to its eclectic political base and its active grassroots campaign. Its two main bases of support were the Asociación Peruana de Empresas Medias y Pequeñas (APEMIPE), an association of SMEs, and the informal sector workers who associated their cause with APEMIPE, and the Evangelical movement. Less than four percent of the Peruvian population was Protestant, but the evangelicals were extremely active at the grassroots level, particularly in areas where traditional parties were weak, such as the urban shantytowns, the &quot;pueblos jóvenes&quot;, and rural areas in the mountains. Although the party only began activities in January 1990, by the time of the elections it had 200,000 members in its ranks.

However, its success at the polls did not translate into a lasting party machinery. The organization was much more of a front than a political party, and its ability to hold together was called into question within a few weeks after attaining power. &quot;Cambio 90&quot;&#x27;s two bases of support had little in common with each other except opposition to Mario Vargas Llosa. Its links to Fujimori were new and were ruptured to a large extent when Fujimori opted for an orthodox economic shock program. Less than six months into his government, Fujimori broke with many of his &quot;Cambio&quot; supporters, including the second vice president and leader of the evangelical movement, Carlos García y García, and APEMIPE. The latter became disenchanted with Fujimori because small businesses were threatened by the dramatic price rises and opening to foreign competition that the &quot;Fujishock&quot; program entailed. During Fujimori&#x27;s first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa&#x27;s party, the FREDEMO, remained in control of both chambers of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty of combatting the Maoist Shining Path () guerrilla organization due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, the Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; the president&#x27;s approval stood at 42%, in the same poll. In the 1995 general elections, Fujimori won re-election for a second term, while the party, along with its partner New Majority won a majority of seats in Congress.

During the 2000 elections, Martha Chávez suggested that Fujimori would dissolve Congress if Peru 2000 did not win a majority of seats. She also said that she could not rule out a fourth election of Fujimori, despite the fact that the Constitution of Peru which was written in part by Chávez herself allows presidents to be elected no more than twice in a row. Indeed, Chávez had earlier promised that Fujimori would not run in the 2000 elections. However, Fujimori ran instead.

In the 9 April 2000 legislative elections, the party was part of the Peru 2000 alliance in which, the alliance won 42.2% of the popular vote and 52 out of 120 seats in the Congress of the Republic.

In the aftermath of Fujimori&#x27;s downfall in late-2000, the party ran once again, allied with New Majority in the 2001 general election, running for congress, attaining only three out of 120 seats in the Congress. For the 2006 general election, the Alliance for the Future coalition was formed, in which Cambio 90 was part alongside New Majority. With Martha Chávez as their presidential nominee, the coalition placed fourth failing to qualify in the June run-off, while in the congressional election, the list got 13 out of 120 seats and received the most votes in Pasco. After the 2006 elections, all of the 13 representatives elected on the Alliance for the Future lists has formed the Parliamentary Fujimorista Group () in Congress.

== Last years and dissolution ==
In the 2011 general election, Cambio 90 split from Fujimorism, and participated under the National Solidarity Alliance, with former Lima Mayor Luis Castañeda as their presidential nominee. The alliance placed fifth at both the presidential and congressional race, attaining nine out of 130 seats, with Renzo Reggiardo as the only elected congressman from Cambio 90. However, Reggiardo left the alliance after the elections and instead joined the small APRA-led &quot;Parliamentary Coordination&quot; bloc. In late 2013, Reggiardo announced the party&#x27;s official dissolution, and announced Peru Secure Homeland as its immediate successor.

<text>Kara Mustafa Pasha (; ; &quot;Mustafa Pasha the Courageous&quot;; 1634/1635 – 25 December 1683) was an Ottoman nobleman, military figure and Grand Vizier, who was a central character in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s last attempts at expansion into both Central and Eastern Europe.

==Early life and career==

Kara Mustafa Pasha was of Turkish origin. However, he was brought up in the Köprülü family, of Albanian origin. He was born in the village of Mirince/Marınca near Merzifon (now called Karamustafapaşa after him), the son of a &quot;sipahi&quot;, cavalry man. His father is said to have served under Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. Possibly as a way to increase his possibilities to start an administrative career, he was introduced into the Köprülü household, where he was educated by Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, and married into the Köprülü family. How he entered the family and the details of his marriage are unclear. Within the household&#x27;s inner service (&quot;enderun&quot;), he held the positions of letter-carrier (&quot;telhisci&quot;, or assistant to the grand vizier) to Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, and of &quot;silahdar&quot; (armourer). He then entered the household of the Sultan as &quot;mirahor-i-sani&quot; (master of the horse). It is said that while growing up, differently from his adoptive Köprülü brothers, he disliked alcohol, as well as Europeans and other non-Muslims. A contemporary French account says he had two children with the little Köprülü princess, who both died young, and that his wife died shortly after their death, at 31. He had four concubines (Fatma, Emine, Ayşe, Zeynep), and by them at least two sons, Yusuf and Mehmed. According to another contemporary report by Giovanni Benaglia, secretary of the Austrian ambassador in Istanbul, he divorced his &quot;beloved Köprülü princess&quot; after their engagement and after they had many children, and gave her to a French renegade, one of his favorites. An account by a contemporary who visited his household, Claudio Angelo di Martelli, reports of three sons who survived his death: Yusuf, Mehmed, and the youngest Ali.

He conformed to the Islamic custom of not wearing silk, and never wore silver or gold, which was a largely unenforced requirement. Europeans who met him (with few exceptions, such as Colyer, who initially described him as a man of &quot;most agreeable nature&quot;) variously described him as greedy, humorous but terse, avid, intransigent, perfidious, covetous, unwilling to accept bribes yet concerned with improving his own well-being, and completely devoted to the Ottoman state. Later accounts by Giovanni Morosini di Alvise, Venetian bailo of Istanbul from 1675 to 1680, speak of a man &quot;born in an obscure place of Asia, in Trebisonda, to castigate the nations,&quot; and describe him as &quot;wholly venal, cruel and unfair.&quot; The English ambassador to Istanbul John Finch also describes him as greedy, and a &quot;grievous oppressor of Christendom.&quot; He was particularly &quot;unbearable to Europeans&quot;, especially for the heavy taxes he imposed (a &quot;stream of &quot;avanias&quot; in the years 1676-1683&quot;). Even though his adoptive siblings also imposed notable &quot;avanias&quot;, their reputation with Europeans was not as bad. Merlijn Orlon noted that his bad reputation doesn&#x27;t do him justice. Orlon explains that he worked to maintain the House of Osman&#x27;s supremacy in their own territories, clashing with ambitious foreign ministers. This resulted in his bad reputation. He dealt differently with the Dutchmen for political reasons, and this resulted in Colyer&#x27;s more positive account of him. As the Franco-allied wars ended, a preferential treatment of the Dutch became useless, and, as a result, Mustafa&#x27;s relationship with Colyer grew troubled.

In 1659 he had become a governor of Silistria and subsequently held a number of important posts. Within ten years, he was acting as deputy for his brother-in-law, the grand vizier Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha when absent from the Sultan&#x27;s court.

He served as a commander of ground troops in a war against Poland, negotiating a settlement with John Sobieski in 1676 that added the province of Podolia to the empire. The victory enabled the Ottomans to transform the Cossack regions of the southern Ukraine into a protectorate. When his brother-in-law Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha died that same year, Mustafa succeeded him as grand vizier.

Kara Mustafa led several successful campaigns into Ukraine, attempting to shore up the position of the Cossack state of Right-Bank Ukraine, then an Ottoman vassal. He established Ottoman garrisons in many of Ukraine&#x27;s cities, and conquered the traditional Cossack capital of Chyhyryn, which had been under Russian occupation.

==Battle of Vienna==

In 1683, he launched a campaign northward into Austria in a last effort to expand the Ottoman Empire after more than 150 years of war. By mid-July, his 100,000-man army had besieged Vienna (guarded by 10,000 Habsburg soldiers), following in the footsteps of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1529. By September, he had taken a portion of the walls and appeared to be on his way to victory.

But on 12 September 1683, a Polish army under King John III Sobieski took advantage of dissent within the Ottoman military command and poor disposition of his troops, winning the Battle of Vienna with a devastating flank attack led by Sobieski&#x27;s Polish Winged Hussars. The Ottomans retreated into Hungary, much of which was subsequently conquered by the Habsburgs and their Holy League allies.

The defeat cost Mustafa his position, and ultimately, his life. On 25 December 1683, Kara Mustafa was executed in Belgrade at the order of Mehmed IV. He suffered death by strangulation with a silk cord, which was the method of capital punishment inflicted on high-ranking persons in the Ottoman Empire. His last words were, &quot;Am I to die?&quot; and &quot;As God pleases.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;The Foundation of Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha&quot; was one of the largest foundations ever founded both in Ottoman Empire and Turkey. According to the official records, it was last managed by the descendants of Kara Mustafa Pasha. The last few managers of the foundation were Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s descendant Ahmed Asım Bey (born 1844), his son Mehmed Nebil Bey (born 1888) (also known as Merzifonlu Karamustafaoğlu or Merzifonlu Karamustafapaşaoğlu), and his son, the Turkish painter Doğan Yılmaz Merzifonlu Karamustafaoğlu, better known as Yılmaz Merzifonlu (1928–2010), until 1976. The &quot;Merzifonlu Karamustafaoğlu&quot; family name ended with the marriage of Yılmaz Merzifonlu&#x27;s only daughter, Abide Tuğçe Mit to Burak Mit from the house of noble Circassian Mit family . Kara Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s family and descendant tree can be found via Turkey&#x27;s Directorate General of Foundations.

Kara Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s legacy in modern Turkey is mixed. Whereas historians describe him either as a capable tactician or reckless commander, Kemal Atatürk held a sympathetic view of the man. It is said that, while attending a lecture at an Ankara institution in 1933, at which a professor spoke disparagingly of Kara Mustafa Pasha, Atatürk spoke up in favour of Kara Mustafa, arguing that marching an army of 173,000 men from Constantinople to Vienna, the &quot;heart of Europe&quot;, was a colossal undertaking for any commander, and that the only other person who came close to such a feat was Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent himself.

Kara Mustafa&#x27;s birthplace near Merzifon district was renamed Karamustafapaşa in his honour.

==In media==
In the 2012 Polish and Italian historical drama film &quot;September Eleven 1683&quot; about the Battle of Vienna, Kara Mustafa Pasha is portrayed by Italian actor Enrico Lo Verso.

<text>The Birdsville Track is an outback road in Australia. The track runs between Birdsville in south-western Queensland and Marree, a small town in the north-eastern part of South Australia. It traverses three deserts along the route, the Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and Tirari Desert.

Originally the track was of poor quality and suitable for high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicles only, but it is now a graded dirt road and a popular tourist route. It is also used by cattle trucks carrying livestock. The track passes through one of the driest parts of Australia, with an average rainfall of less than 100 mm annually. The area is extremely barren, dry and isolated. Travellers should carry water and supplies in case of emergencies.

==History==
The track was opened in the 1860s to walk cattle from northern Queensland and the Northern Territory to the nearest railhead in Port Augusta, which was later moved to Marree. The pioneering drover credited with establishing the track was Percy Burt. Burt set up a store at Diamantina Crossing, today known as Birdsville, and used the path to bring cattle out of the Channel Country to the railhead at Marree that was completed in 1883. This stock route was at least 1,000 km shorter than the alternative path to Brisbane.

By 1916 enough bores had been sunk into the Great Artesian Basin along the route that the movement of stock was much easier and safer than in earlier years. Bores were drilled at 40 km intervals.

An isolated store along the track operated for several decades from the Mulka Station. The Mulka Store Ruins are listed in the South Australian Heritage Register.

Over the years the Birdsville track became one of the country&#x27;s most isolated and best-known stock routes, as well as a mail route made famous by outback legend Tom Kruse. Tom Kruse and the track were immortalised in &quot;The Back of Beyond&quot;, the 1954 documentary film made by John Heyer. Kruse&#x27;s services ceased in 1963, replaced by an air service from Adelaide that started in 1970.

In 2006, as part of the Year of the Outback, the Australian Governor-General, Michael Jeffery, travelled along the track in a 5-day event.

The route was earmarked to be signed as part National Route 83 in the original plan of National Routes. It was to start in southern SA before travelling north through to far-north QLD. The route was never fully signed, the Birdsville Track being still largely unsealed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the track experienced a boost in popularity among drivers taking the route to avoid New South Wales and possible quarantine.

==Today==
Up until the 1930s only stock and camel trains would take the Birdsville track. Today, it has become a very popular track. As a result, the track is reasonably well maintained and generally fairly smooth. However like any outback track, its condition can change, especially after rain. Large stretches of the track can still be destroyed by flash flooding and drifting sand. 

In dry conditions, a shorter route at the northern end depicted on maps as the &quot;Inside track&quot; saves 35 kilometres in distance. Other than this, the road has no major intersections.

Fuel, supplies and facilities, including a hotel, can be found on the track at the Mungeranie station, 204 km from Marree and 313 km from Birdsville. It is linked with the Strzelecki Track via the Walkers Crossing Track, which is closed in summer and only traversable in dry weather.

==Major junctions==



==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Alice to Nowhere&quot; and the book by Evan Green on which it is based, are largely set on the Birdsville Track. The title is a misnomer, as Alice Springs is in the Northern Territory, and at least from any part of the Track.

<text>James Eugene Carrey (; born January 17, 1962) is a Canadian-American actor and comedian primarily known for his energetic slapstick performances. After spending the 1980s honing his comedy act and playing supporting roles in films, Carrey gained recognition when he was cast in the American sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990–1994). He broke out as a film star after starring in a string of box office hits, such as &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot;, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (all 1994), &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;, and &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (both 1995). The success of these five films led to Carrey being the first comic actor to receive an upfront $20 million salary for performing in films, beginning with &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996).

He continued to have success as a leading actor in comedies such as &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003), &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (2004), and &quot;Yes Man&quot; (2008). Since the 2010s, Carrey appeared in fewer films, with notable works including &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; (2014) and his role as Doctor Eggman in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film series (2020–present).

Although largely typecast as a comedic actor, Carrey had success in dramatic roles. His critically acclaimed performances include the title role in &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998) and Andy Kaufman in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999), winning Golden Globe Awards for each film. He starred in the romantic drama film &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe. Carrey also starred in the Showtime tragicomedy series &quot;Kidding&quot; (2018–2020), for which he received his seventh Golden Globe nomination.

== Early life ==
Carrey was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, to Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant. He was raised Catholic and has three older siblings, John, Patricia, and Rita. His mother was of Irish and Scottish descent, and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry; the family&#x27;s original surname was Carré&quot;.

At age eight, he began making faces before a mirror and discovered a talent for doing impressions. At age ten, Carrey wrote a letter to Carol Burnett of the &quot;Carol Burnett Show&quot; pointing out that he was already a master of impressions and should be considered for a role on the show; he was overjoyed when he received a form letter reply. A fan of Monty Python, whose TV show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; aired in the 1970s, in 2014 Carrey appeared on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Best Bits (Mostly)&quot; and recalled the effect on him of Ernest Scribbler (played by Michael Palin) laughing himself to death in &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot; sketch. &quot;Radio Times&quot; states, &quot;You&#x27;ll see why immediately: Palin&#x27;s performance is uncannily Carreyesque.&quot;

Carrey spent his early years in the borough of Scarborough, Ontario, part of Metropolitan Toronto, where he attended Blessed Trinity Catholic Elementary School in North York. His family later moved to Burlington, Ontario, where they would spend eight years; Jim attended Aldershot High School while there. Some time later, his family became homeless and lived together in a Volkswagen van while teenage Jim and his brother spent months living in a tent in Charles Daley Park on the Lake Ontario shore in Lincoln, Ontario. The family struggled financially, however, their situation started improving once his father found employment in the accounting department at the Titan Wheels tire factory in Scarborough. 

Furthermore, in return for living in the house across the street from the factory, the family—primarily teenage sons Jim and John—would work as janitors and security guards at the tire factory, doing eight-hour shifts from 6 pm into the next morning. Moving back to Scarborough, teenage Jim started attending Agincourt Collegiate Institute before dropping out of school on his sixteenth birthday. He began to perform comedy in downtown Toronto while continuing to work at the factory. In a 2007 &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; interview, Carrey said, &quot;If my career in show business hadn&#x27;t panned out I would probably be working today in Hamilton, Ontario, at the Dofasco steel mill.&quot; As a young man, he could see the steel mills across the Burlington Bay and often thought that was &quot;where the great jobs were.&quot;

==Career==
===1977–1982: Early impressionist work in Toronto===
Carrey&#x27;s first stand-up comedy experience took place in 1977 at the age of 15 with his father trying to help him put together a stage act, driving him to Downtown Toronto to debut at the recently-opened Yuk Yuk&#x27;s comedy club operating one-night-a-week out of community center The 519&#x27;s basement on Church Street. For the performance, Carrey had his attire—a polyester leisure suit—chosen by his mother who reasoned &quot;that&#x27;s how they dress on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;&quot;. Pubescent Carrey&#x27;s conventional impersonations bombed, proving ill-suited for a club with a raunchy comedic sensibility and giving him doubts about his potential as a professional entertainer. Decades later, recalling Carrey&#x27;s stand-up debut, Yuk Yuk&#x27;s owner Mark Breslin described it as &quot;bad Rich Little&quot;. His family&#x27;s financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey&#x27;s show business ambitions.

Eventually, the family&#x27;s financial situation improved and they moved into a new home in Jackson&#x27;s Point. With more domestic stability, Carrey returned to the stage in 1979 with a more polished act that led to his first paid gig: a 20-minute spot at the Hay Loft club on Highway 48 in Scarborough for a reported Can$20 compensation on a bill with the Mother of Pearl performer from &quot;The Pig and Whistle&quot;. He soon faced his fears and went back downtown to the site of his debacle from two years earlier—Yuk Yuk&#x27;s that had in the meantime moved into a permanent location on Bay Street in the fashionable Yorkville district. In a short period of time, the seventeen-year-old went from open-mic nights at the club to regular paid shows, building his reputation in the process.

Parallel to his increasing local Toronto-area popularity as an impressionist stand-up comic, Carrey tried to break into sketch comedy, auditioning to be a cast member for the 1980–81 season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Carrey ended up not being selected by the show&#x27;s new executive producer Jean Doumanian who picked thirty-one-year-old Charles Rocket instead. Decades later, after establishing himself as a Hollywood film star, Carrey would host the show in May 1996, January 2011, and October 2014. After not getting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Carrey took a voice acting job performing &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;-inspired bits on &quot;The All-Night Show&quot;, an overnight program airing locally on the CFMT-TV channel branded as Multilingual Television (MTV).

Continuing to perform his stand-up act of contortionist impressions in the city of Toronto and surrounding towns, in February 1981, nineteen-year-old Carrey was booked as the opening act for the rock band Goddo at The Roxy Theatre in Barrie for two shows on consecutive nights; the rock crowd booed him offstage and he refused to return for the second night. Two weeks later, however, a review of one of Carrey&#x27;s spots at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s—alongside a sizable photo of him doing a stage impression of Sammy Davis Jr.—appeared in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; on the front page of its entertainment section with the writer Bruce Blackadar raving about &quot;a genuine star coming to life&quot;. Save for a brief mention in the &quot;Barrie Examiner&quot;, it was the first time Carrey received significant mainstream corporate media coverage and the glowing praise in one of Canada&#x27;s highest-circulation dailies created demand for his impressionist stand-up act throughout the country. 

In April 1981, he appeared in an episode of the televised stand-up show &quot;An Evening at the Improv&quot;. That summer, he landed one of the main roles in &quot;Introducing... Janet&quot;, a made-for-TV movie that premiered in September 1981 on the CBC drawing more than a million viewers for its first airing in Canada. Playing a struggling impressionist comic Tony Maroni, it was Carrey&#x27;s first acting role. The CBC promotion the movie had received as well its subsequent high nationwide viewership further solidified the youngster&#x27;s comedic status in the country; by the time the movie finished its CBC run of repeats several years later, its title for the home video release on VHS was changed to &quot;Rubberface&quot; in order to take advantage of the comic&#x27;s by then established prominence for doing elaborate contortionist impressions. Making more comedy club appearances in the United States, Carrey was noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield who signed Carrey to open his tour performances. By December 1981, a well-known comic in Canada, &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported about Carrey waiting for a United States work permit having received interest from Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, largely off his reputation from Canada.

In the early part of 1982, Carrey reportedly performed for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; bookers Jim McCawley and Bud Robinson as part of the program&#x27;s audition process for stand-up comic spots. However, rather than being booked on the show, Carrey got advised to further hone his act, so he went back home to the Toronto area where he had already built a significant following. Touring venues throughout North America as the opening act for Rodney Dangerfield, Carrey made a stop at home in Toronto on June 19, 1982, performing two sold-out shows at Massey Hall.

===1983–1993: Move to Hollywood===
In early 1983, Carrey decided to move to Hollywood where he began regularly performing at The Comedy Store. Getting on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; became his immediate career goal, and, by spring 1983, he appeared to have achieved it after getting booked for a stand-up set on the highly-rated late night show. However, a lukewarm club set at The Improv got him unbooked. Though struggling to replicate his success in Los Angeles, Carrey continued being a big hit in his hometown Toronto where he returned during late April 1983 to perform at the short-lived B.B. Magoon&#x27;s theatrical venue on Bloor Street on three consecutive nights. While in town, CTV&#x27;s flagship newsmagazine program &quot;W5&quot; did a feature on Carrey that aired nationally in Canada. Back in L.A., within months, he landed the main role on &quot;The Duck Factory&quot;, a sitcom being developed for NBC, and, in late November 1983, still got to debut his impressionist act on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; via a promotional appearance for the sitcom about to start airing nationally in the United States on the same network. In the meantime, he was cast for a supporting role in the Warner Bros. comedy production &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, shot in the Canadian province of Alberta during late summer 1983. For his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance that aired on American Thanksgiving, 21-year-old Carrey went through his most popular impressions—Elvis Presley, Leonid Brezhnev, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Michael Landon, James Dean, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Charles Nelson Reilly, characters from &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy—in rapid succession. After completing his set, though getting the OK gesture from Carson, the impressionist comic was notably not waved over by the host to join him on the couch—a usual indication that while sufficiently pleased, the powerful host was probably not ecstatic about the performance. The end of 1983 saw Carrey go back home to Toronto once more for a publicized New Years&#x27; Eve performance at the Royal York Hotel&#x27;s Imperial Room.

Originally scheduled to start airing in January 1984, &quot;The Duck Factory&quot; sitcom debuted in April, airing Thursdays at 9:30pm between &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. The same month, Carrey took a job hosting the 1984 U-Know Awards ceremony held in Toronto at the Royal York Hotel&#x27;s Ballroom. By the time he made his debut appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in late July 1984, the network had already canceled &quot;The Duck Factory&quot;; Carrey went back to touring with his impressionist act, including often opening for Rodney Dangerfield.

After being noticed doing stand-up by producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and contacted to audition for a teen horror sex comedy being developed by The Samuel Goldwyn Company, Carrey landed a starring role in &quot;Once Bitten&quot; shot in early 1985. Carrey would continue getting film roles; throughout late summer and early fall 1985, he shot a supporting part in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; which went into a long post-production process. In parallel, he decided to try out for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; again, this time ahead of the show&#x27;s 1985–86 season being prepared by returning executive producer Lorne Michaels who was looking to hire an all-new cast. Five years removed from his previous &quot;SNL&quot; audition, twenty-three-year-old Carrey was rejected again, reportedly never even getting the chance to audition his material—&#x27;post-nuclear Elvis&#x27; hybrid impression and impersonation of Henry Fonda from &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;—in front of executive producer Michaels due to the show&#x27;s producers and senior writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey deciding that Michaels would not like it. Unlike his previous &quot;SNL&quot; rejection, Carrey now had a bit of a film career to fall back on in addition to his impressionist stand-up act; &quot;Once Bitten&quot; was released in mid November 1985 and turned out to be a modest box-office hit despite drawing poor reviews.

Back on the comedy club circuit with impressions, in fall 1986, Carrey auditioned for &quot;SNL&quot;″s upcoming season, his third attempt at getting on the ensemble sketch comedy show. Finally managing to perform for the show&#x27;s executive producer Lorne Michaels at a Burbank studio, with returning cast members Dennis Miller, Jon Lovitz, and Nora Dunn also watching the audition, Carrey was rejected again. Among the group of hopefuls auditioning alongside Carrey on this occasion were Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman, both of whom were hired. Sensing that doing only impressions was turning into a career dead-end, Carrey set out to develop a new live comedy act. Much to the dismay of comedy club owners booking him, he began abandoning trademark celebrity impressions, opting instead to try adding observational and character humor to his comedic repertoire, a process that often involved forcing himself to improvise and scramble in front of dissatisfied live audiences that came to see him do impressions. From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot;. The popularity of the series helped him to land his first few major film roles.

===1994–1997: Rise to fame===
Carrey played the lead role in &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; which was released in February 1994 and went on to gross $72 million in the United States and Canada. Following its success and before the release of his next film, &quot;The Mask&quot;, which was anticipated to be another hit, Morgan Creek Productions paid him $5 million to reprise his role as Ace Ventura and New Line Cinema offered him $7 million to make a sequel to &quot;The Mask&quot; and paid him $7 million to appear in &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, a nearly tenfold increase on his salary for &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;. &quot;The Mask&quot;, released in July 1994, grossed $351 million worldwide, and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, released in December 1994, was another commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide. Carrey received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor for his work in &quot;The Mask&quot; and was voted second on Quigley&#x27;s Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, behind Tom Hanks.

Carrey portrayed the Batman villain the Riddler in the Joel Schumacher-directed superhero film &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995). The film received mixed reviews, but was a box office success. He reprised his role as Ace Ventura in &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; which was also released in 1995. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but poorly received by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend. Carrey became the first comic actor to be paid an upfront salary of $20 million for his next film, &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996). Directed by Ben Stiller, the film was a satirical black comedy, in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by Matthew Broderick). The role was a departure from the &quot;hapless, hyper, overconfident&quot; characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey&#x27;s change of tone from previous films. Carrey also starred in the music video of the film&#x27;s closing song, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; by Jerry Cantrell. Despite the reviews, &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; grossed $102 million worldwide.

He soon bounced back with the critically acclaimed comedy &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (1997), playing Fletcher Reede, an unethical lawyer rendered unable to lie by his young son&#x27;s birthday wish. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed.&quot;

===1998–1999: Critical acclaim===
The following year he decided to take a pay cut to play the seriocomic role of Truman Burbank in the satirical comedy-drama film &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998). The film was highly praised and brought Carrey further international acclaim, leading many to believe he would be nominated for an Academy Award. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama but did not receive an Academy Award nomination. &quot;The Truman Show&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. A Film4 critic stated that the film &quot;allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy&quot;, adding that it was &quot;a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire&quot;.

That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of Garry Shandling&#x27;s &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, in which he deliberately ripped into Shandling&#x27;s character. In 1999, Carrey had the lead role in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;. He portrayed comedian Andy Kaufman to critical acclaim and received his second Golden Globe in a row but again failed to be nominated for an Academy Award. In addition, he received his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Actor.

===2000–2011: Established actor and diversification===

In 2000, Carrey reteamed with the Farrelly brothers, who had previously directed him in &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, for the black comedy film &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, a film that received mixed reviews but enjoyed box office success. Carrey played the role of state trooper Charlie Baileygates, who has multiple personalities and romances a woman portrayed by Renée Zellweger. That same year, Carrey starred in the second highest-grossing Christmas film of all time, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, playing the title character, for which he received both praise and criticism from critics alongside a Golden Globe nomination.

For his next feature film, Carrey starred opposite Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman in Tom Shadyac&#x27;s international hit comedy &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; (2003). Carrey played a television newsman who unexpectedly receives God&#x27;s omnipotent abilities when the deity decides to take a vacation. The film received mixed reviews upon release but still became a financial success, earning over $484 million worldwide, and going on to become the seventeenth highest-grossing live action comedy of all time.

In 2004, Carrey starred in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;. The film received critical acclaim upon release. Critics highly praised Carrey&#x27;s portrayal of Joel Barish, in addition to the performance of his co-star Kate Winslet, who was nominated for an Oscar. According to CNN&#x27;s reviewer Paul Clinton, Carrey&#x27;s performance was the actor&#x27;s &quot;best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever.&quot; Carrey received another Golden Globe nomination and his first BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actor. Carrey&#x27;s next appearance was in the 2004 black comedy fantasy film &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, which was based on the children&#x27;s novels of the same name. The film was positively received; Desson Thomson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said of Carrey&#x27;s approach to the character of Count Olaf,

That same year, Carrey was inducted into the Canadian Walk of Fame. In 2005, Carrey starred in the remake of &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; with Téa Leoni, which grossed $200 million with a profit of $100 million.
Carrey reunited with Joel Schumacher, director of &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, for &quot;The Number 23&quot; (2007), a psychological thriller co-starring Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston. In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the number 23, after finding a book about a man with the same obsession. The film was panned by critics. The following year Carrey provided his voice for Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008). Carrey voiced Horton the Elephant for the CGI-animated feature, which was a box office success, grossing over $290 million worldwide. Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper in &quot;Yes Man&quot; (also 2008). Carrey played a man who signs up for a self-help program that teaches him to say yes to everything. Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Yes Man&quot; is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it&#x27;s even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh.&quot; The film earned $225 million at the box office worldwide.
Since 2009, Carrey&#x27;s work has included a leading role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa&#x27;s &quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot;, premiering in January 2009 at the Sundance Film Festival before receiving a wide release in February 2010. Carrey portrayed Steven Jay Russell, a con artist, imposter, and multiple prison escapee who falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (played by Ewan McGregor). The film received largely positive reviews, with Damon Wise of &quot;The Times&quot; giving the film four stars out of five, stating, &quot;&quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot; is an extraordinary film that serves as a reminder of just how good Carrey can be when he&#x27;s not tied into a generic Hollywood crowd-pleaser. His comic timing remains as exquisite as ever.&quot; For the first time in his career, Carrey portrayed multiple characters in Disney&#x27;s 3D animated take on the classic Charles Dickens tale, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2009), voicing Ebenezer Scrooge and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film also starred Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman, and Cary Elwes. The film received decent reviews and was a financial success. Carrey landed the lead role in &quot;Mr. Popper&#x27;s Penguins&quot; (2011), playing Tom Popper Jr., a realtor who becomes the caretaker of a family of penguins. The film received a mixed reception upon release.

===2012–2018: Change in pace ===
He starred alongside former co-star Steve Carell in the Don Scardino-directed comedy film &quot;The Incredible Burt Wonderstone&quot; (2013). Carrey played Steve Gray, a dangerous street magician who overshadows the formerly successful magician Burt Wonderstone (played by Carell). The film was released in March 2013 to mixed reviews and underperformed significantly at the box office, grossing just over $27 million on a $30 million budget. Around the same time, he appeared in &quot;Kick-Ass 2&quot; (also 2013) as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He retracted support for the film two months prior to its release. He issued a statement via his Twitter account that, in light of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, &quot;Now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence.&quot;

Peter Farrelly said in April 2012 that Carrey and Jeff Daniels would return for a &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; sequel, &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot;, with the Farrelly brothers writing and directing and a planned September 2012 production start. In June, however, Carrey&#x27;s representative said Carrey had left the project because the comedian felt New Line and Warner Bros. were unenthusiastic toward it. However, on October 1, 2012, Yahoo!&#x27;s &quot;The Yo Show&quot; carried the news item that the script was complete and that the original actors, Carrey and Daniels, would be reprising their roles. The plot involved one of the characters having sired a child and needing to find them to obtain a kidney. &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; was released in November 2014.

In March 2013, Carrey announced that he had written a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;How Roland Rolls&quot;, about a scared wave named Roland. He described it as &quot;kind of a metaphysical children&#x27;s story, which deals with a lot of heavy stuff in a really childish way.&quot; Carrey self-published the book, which was released in September 2013. On March 25, 2013, Carrey released a parody music video with Eels through Funny or Die, with Carrey replacing Mark Oliver Everett on vocals. The song and video, titled &quot;Cold Dead Hand&quot; and set as a musical act during the variety program &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically former NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston. Carrey delivered the commencement address at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, in May 2014 and received an honorary doctorate for his achievements as a comedian, artist, author, and philanthropist. On August 29, 2014, Carrey was honored by Canada Post with a limited-edition postage stamp with his portrait on it. Carrey was a producer on &quot;Rubble Kings&quot;, a 2015 documentary film that depicts events preceding and following the Hoe Avenue peace meeting.

In June 2017, Showtime began airing the dramedy &quot;I&#x27;m Dying Up Here&quot;, for which Carrey served as the executive producer. The show, which chronicles a group of stand-up comics in 1970s Los Angeles, incorporates aspects of Carrey&#x27;s own experience. In September of that year, that same network announced that he would star in a comedy series titled &quot;Kidding&quot;, which would reunite Carrey and director Michel Gondry. By the end of 2017, it was announced that Catherine Keener would star opposite Carrey in &quot;Kidding&quot;. The series lasted two seasons.

Carrey was also the subject of two documentaries in 2017. The first, a short subject entitled &quot;I Needed Color&quot; about his lifelong passion for art, was released online in the summer. Later that year another documentary, &quot;Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond—Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton&quot;, premiered at The Venice Film Festival and was later picked up by Netflix. The film chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama during the shooting of &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, when he never broke character as Andy Kaufman. It incorporates footage that was shot for the film&#x27;s electronic press kit but ultimately pulled by Universal as they felt that it was too damaging.

===2019–present: Return to mainstream===

In June 2018, Carrey was cast as Dr. Ivo Robotnik, the main antagonist of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game series, in a film adaptation of the franchise. The film was released in February 2020 to positive reviews. Carrey&#x27;s portrayal of Ivo Robotnik was praised, with some considering it one of his best performances in years. Carrey returned for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, released in April 2022, which grossed $72 million at the US box office in its opening weekend to give Carrey the best opening of his career to date. 

In 2020, Carrey published &quot;Memoirs and Misinformation&quot;. In September, during the final stages of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, it was announced that Carrey would portray presidential nominee Joe Biden on the 46th season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, taking over the role from Jason Sudeikis, Woody Harrelson and John Mulaney. However, many felt Carrey&#x27;s high-energy comedy style clashed with the real-life Biden&#x27;s low-key persona, producing an imitation that lacked authenticity, and failed to impress viewers and critics. On December 19, 2020, Carrey announced that he would step down from playing Biden on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, stating that he had a six-week deal. Cast member Alex Moffat succeeded Carrey in portraying Biden during the cold open of the episode hosted by Kristen Wiig on the same day. Carrey appeared as the narrator of the Weeknd&#x27;s album &quot;Dawn FM&quot;, released on January 7, 2022.

In April 2022, Carrey announced that he was considering retirement, saying: &quot;I have enough. I&#x27;ve done enough. I am enough.&quot; He said he would return if he were offered a script that he felt would be &quot;really important for people to see&quot;. In February 2024, it was announced that Carrey would reprise his role as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;. Carrey also plays Ivo Robotnik’s grandfather, Gerald Robotnik. Carrey reportedly told an Associated Press reporter that he agreed to return to the &quot;Sonic&quot; universe because &quot;I need the money, frankly.&quot; He later clarified in interviews in December 2024 that he planned to “power rest” rather than retire, while also stating that he was open to continuing his role in the &quot;Sonic&quot; film series.

==Personal life==
Carrey suffers from depression and took Prozac to combat the symptoms for years. He later said that he no longer takes medications of any kind and abstains from coffee, alcohol and drugs. 

He received U.S. citizenship in October 2004 and remains a dual citizen of the United States and his native Canada. 

Carrey owns various properties in Los Angeles and has lived in Brentwood since 1994. In November 2022, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs banned 100 Canadians including Carrey from entering Russia as a reciprocity for the international sanctions which had been introduced due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.
=== Relationships ===
 Carrey dated singer Linda Ronstadt for eight months in 1983. In 1987, on March 28, Carrey married former actress and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer. Their daughter, Jane Erin Carrey, was born on September 6, 1987. Carrey and Womer divorced in 1995.

On September 23, 1996, Carrey married his &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; co-star Lauren Holly; this second marriage lasted less than a year. From 1999 to 2000, Carrey was engaged to his &quot;Me, Myself and Irene&quot; co-star Renée Zellweger. In 2002, he was in a relationship with January Jones. In 2005, Carrey met model and actress Jenny McCarthy, and he made public in June 2006 that they were in a romantic relationship. They ended it in April 2010, with McCarthy noting in October 2010 that they had remained good friends.

In 2012, Carrey met Cathriona White, a makeup artist from County Tipperary, Ireland. They dated between 2012 and 2015. On September 28, 2015, White was found dead from a prescription drug overdose; the death was ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Carrey was a pallbearer at her funeral in Cappawhite, Ireland. In January 2019 when Carrey attended the Golden Globes 2019 Party, he was accompanied by his then-girlfriend Ginger Gonzaga. The couple split after less than a year of dating.

=== Wrongful death lawsuits ===
Carrey&#x27;s girlfriend Cathriona White married Mark Burton in 2013, in Las Vegas. She and Carrey had been dating on and off since 2012, and was still married but dating Carrey when she died in 2015. On September 19, 2016, Burton filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey, claiming that he had used his &quot;immense wealth and celebrity status&quot; to illegally obtain and distribute prescription drugs involved in White&#x27;s death. Carrey released a statement the following day:

In October 2016, White&#x27;s mother, Brigid Sweetman, also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey. Sweetman later issued a statement: &quot;These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the public and the court. Carrey has now been shown for what he is—a dishonest Hollywood celebrity who thinks he can say anything and fool people just because he is famous.&quot; Both lawsuits were dismissed on January 25, 2018, and attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal proceedings.

=== Vaccine skepticism ===
In 2009, Carrey wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. With former partner Jenny McCarthy, Carrey led a &quot;Green Our Vaccines&quot; march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of &quot;toxic substances&quot; from children&#x27;s vaccines, out of a belief that children had received &quot;too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic&quot;. The rally was criticized by David Gorski, an American surgical oncologist on &quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot; blog, for being anti-vaccine and not &quot;pro-safe vaccine&quot;, and by Steven Parker on the WebMD website for being &quot;irresponsible&quot;.

On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a new vaccination law, Carrey called California Governor Jerry Brown a &quot;corporate fascist&quot; who was &quot;poisoning&quot; children by enacting the vaccination requirements. The law disallowed religious and philosophical reasons for exemption from vaccination. Carrey was criticized for being &quot;ignorant when it comes to vaccines&quot; by Arthur Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University, and by Jeffrey Kluger, senior writer at &quot;Time&quot;, who described his anti-vaccination statements as &quot;angry, dense and immune to reason&quot;.

=== Political and spiritual views ===
Carrey is an outspoken advocate of the &quot;law of attraction&quot;. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 17, 1997, he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use visualization techniques to get work. He also stated that he visualized a $10 million check given to him for &quot;acting services rendered&quot;, placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a $10 million check for his role in &quot;Dumb and Dumber.&quot; Carrey practices Transcendental Meditation. Carrey has also advocated socialism and has urged the Democratic Party to embrace the movement saying &quot;We have to say yes to socialism, to the word and everything. We have to stop apologizing&quot;. 

Carrey has shared his own political cartoon drawings since August 2017, including controversial renderings of then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and then-President Donald Trump. He sparked an international event on March 31, 2019, posting a drawing criticizing fascism by depicting Benito Mussolini&#x27;s infamous death with Clara Petacci; this irked Mussolini&#x27;s granddaughter Alessandra, who chided him on Twitter, calling him &quot;a bastard&quot; and his artworks &quot;dirty paper&quot;. His drawing repertoire culminated in an exhibition titled &quot;IndigNation&quot;, which opened on October 23, 2018, at the Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles and featured 108 pen-and-ink drawings from Carrey&#x27;s Twitter feed from 2016 to 2018. In February 2021, Carrey announced he would discontinue political cartoons.

In a 2004 interview with 60 Minutes, Carrey reportedly said, “I&#x27;m a Buddhist, I&#x27;m a Muslim, I&#x27;m a Christian.” In June 2017, Carrey delivered a speech at a Homeboy Industries event, where he said, “I want to speak to the fact that I believe that this room is filled with God, and that you are heroes to me and I admire you.”

=== Artwork and NFTs ===
In 2017, Carrey revealed that he had been painting for the past six years. In 2011, he exhibited the painting &quot;Nothing to See Here&quot; in an art show in Palm Springs at the Heather James Fine Art Gallery. In 2017, Carrey released a six-minute documentary entitled, &quot;I Needed Color&quot;, which showed him working in his studio. In April 2022, Carrey announced that he had minted his first art NFT via the NFT platform SuperRare. The NFT is based on a painting entitled &quot;Sunshower&quot;, and is accompanied by original voiceover.

<text>John Preston (December 11, 1945 in Medfield, Massachusetts – April 28, 1994 in Portland, Maine) was an American author of gay erotica and an editor of gay nonfiction anthologies.

==Life and works==
He grew up in Medfield, Massachusetts, later living in a number of major American cities before settling in Portland, Maine in 1979. A writer of fiction and nonfiction, dealing mostly with issues in gay life, he was a pioneer in the early gay rights movement in Minneapolis. He helped found one of the earliest gay community centers in the United States, edited two newsletters devoted to sexual health, and served as editor of &quot;The Advocate&quot; in 1975.

He was the author or editor of nearly fifty books, including such erotic landmarks as &quot;Mr. Benson&quot; and &quot;I Once Had a Master and Other Tales of Erotic Love&quot;. Other works include &quot;Franny, the Queen of Provincetown&quot; (first a novel, then adapted for stage), &quot;The Big Gay Book: A Man&#x27;s Survival Guide for the Nineties&quot;, &quot;Personal Dispatches: Writers Confront AIDS&quot;, and &quot;Hometowns: Gay Men Write About Where They Belong&quot;.

Preston&#x27;s writing (which he described as pornography) was part of a movement in the 1970s and 1980s toward higher literary quality in gay erotic fiction. Preston was an outspoken advocate of the artistic and social worth of erotic writings, delivering a lecture at Harvard University entitled &quot;My Life as a Pornographer&quot;. The lecture was later published in an essay collection with the same name. The collection includes Preston&#x27;s thoughts about the gay leather community, to which he belonged. His writings caused controversy when he was one of several gay and lesbian authors to have their books confiscated at the border by Canada Customs. Testimony regarding the literary merit of his novel &quot;I Once Had a Master&quot; helped a Vancouver LGBT bookstore, Little Sister&#x27;s Book and Art Emporium, to partially win a case against Canada Customs in the Canadian Supreme Court in 2000. Preston also brought gay erotic fiction to mainstream readers by editing the &quot;Flesh and the Word&quot; anthologies for a major press.

Preston served as a journalist and essayist throughout his life. He wrote news articles for &quot;Drummer&quot; and other gay magazines, produced a syndicated column on gay life in Maine, and penned a column for &quot;Lambda Book Report&quot; called &quot;Preston on Publishing.&quot; His nonfiction anthologies, which collected essays by himself and others on everyday aspects of gay and lesbian life, won him the Lambda Literary Award. and the American Library Association&#x27;s Stonewall Book Award. He was especially noted for his writings on New England.

Although primarily known as a gay fiction writer, Preston was also hired by a local newspaper, &quot;The Portland Chronicle&quot;, to write news articles and features about his adopted hometown of Portland. He wrote a long feature about the local monopoly newspaper, the Portland Press Herald, as well as many food articles, movie reviews, and other writing.

In addition, Preston wrote men&#x27;s adventure novels under the pseudonyms of Mike McCray, Preston MacAdam, and Jack Hild (pen names that he shared with other authors). Taking what he had learned from authoring those books, he wrote the &quot;Alex Kane&quot; adventure novels about gay characters. These books, which included &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; &quot;Golden Years,&quot; and &quot;Deadly Lies,&quot; combined action-story plots with an exploration of issues such as the problems facing gay youth.

Preston was among the first writers to popularize the genre of safe sex stories, editing a safe sex anthology entitled &quot;Hot Living&quot; in 1985. He helped to found the AIDS Project of Southern Maine. In the late 1980s, he discovered that he himself was HIV positive.

Some of his last essays, found in his nonfiction anthologies and in his posthumous collection &quot;Winter&#x27;s Light&quot;, describe his struggle to come emotionally to terms with a disease that had already killed many of his friends and fellow writers.

He died of AIDS complications on April 28, 1994, aged 48, at his home in Portland.

==Legacy==
His papers are held in the Preston Archive at Brown University.

In 1994, Preston received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International.

In 2007 the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the John Preston award for short fiction.

<text>Randolph Charles Bachman ( ; born September 27, 1943) is a Canadian guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He was a founding member of the bands The Guess Who and Bachman–Turner Overdrive. He was the writer and singer of several hit rock songs, including, Takin&#x27; Care of Business, and You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet. Bachman also recorded as a solo artist and was part of a number of short-lived bands such as Brave Belt, Union and Ironhorse. He was a national radio personality on CBC Radio, hosting the weekly music show, &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot;. Bachman was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2016.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Karl (Charlie) Bachman and Anne (Nancy) Dobrinsky, Bachman is of half-German and half-Ukrainian descent. At age three, he won a singing contest on CKY&#x27;s King of the Saddle program and age five he had started studying the violin in the Royal Toronto Conservatory system. He studied violin until the age of 12 when he grew dissatisfied with the structured lessons. He found that while he could not read music, he could play anything if he heard it once; he referred to it as his phonographic memory.

At age 15, Bachman saw Elvis Presley play on Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s television show and the sight of the guitar around Presley&#x27;s neck inspired him. He learned three chords from his cousin, then started practising on a modified Hawaiian Dobro. At age 16, Bachman met Lenny Breau and during the next two years Breau taught Bachman finger picking. Breau also introduced him to Chet Atkins&#x27; music.

In 1959, Bachman bought a ticket to see Les Paul in concert at a Winnipeg supper club but could not get in as he was too young. He instead helped Paul set up before the show and also helped him reload everything into the car after the show. Still a budding guitarist at this point, Bachman asked Paul if he could teach him a guitar lick; Paul ended up teaching his version of &quot;How High the Moon&quot;.

He was initially a good student at school until he took up the guitar, when he focused on that instrument to the exclusion of his education. He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at West Kildonan Collegiate. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either &quot;flunked or dropped out and came back&quot;, and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had &quot;discipline and determination&quot; because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his &quot;lack of studiousness&quot;, and finished his schooling at Garden City Collegiate. He went on to study business administration at what is now Red River College, but did not graduate.

== Professional musical career ==
=== The Guess Who ===
In 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band had changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to The Guess Who. In 1965, the Guess Who had a No. 1 hit in Canada with their version of Johnny Kidd&#x27;s &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;, which also charted in the US at No. 22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and Burton Cummings became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who worked mostly in their home country, releasing numerous Top 40 singles in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song &quot;These Eyes&quot;, co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: &quot;Wheatfield Soul&quot; (1969), &quot;Canned Wheat&quot; (1969), and &quot;American Woman&quot; (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group&#x27;s songs during this period.

In early 1970, the single &quot;American Woman&quot; hit No. 1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the &quot;ghetto scenes&quot; and &quot;war machines&quot; of the US, reflecting the Guess Who&#x27;s experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the Vietnam War at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape US Military service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of &quot;American Woman&quot;. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members&#x27; lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members. He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor&#x27;s care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.

=== Brave Belt and Bachman–Turner Overdrive ===
Before his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for RCA Records, &quot;Axe&quot;, over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the country rock band Brave Belt with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled LP in 1971. Randy&#x27;s brother Robbie Bachman was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. Fred Turner subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.

Left with a three-member line-up, Brave Belt added Tim Bachman as a second guitarist. With this lineup, the members signed a record deal with Mercury Records and renamed the band Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Often referred to as &quot;B.T.O.&quot; for short, they released their first self-titled album, &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive&quot; in May 1973.

In December 1973, the band released their second album, &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;. This album brought the band greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; and &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, which charted at Nos. 12 and 23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, &quot;Not Fragile&quot;. The release hit No. 1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, &quot;Roll On Down the Highway&quot; and &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;, which charted at Nos. 14 and 1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being &quot;American Woman&quot; while he was in The Guess Who.

The band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot; and &quot;Head On&quot;. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, and &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out For No. 1&quot;. In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album &quot;Freeways&quot;, some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they did not have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at No. 70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the &quot;BTO&quot; name to the remaining band members.

=== 1979–1981 ===
After his departure from Bachman–Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, &quot;Survivor&quot;. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the solo album, he formed a new rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called Ironhorse. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single &quot;Sweet Lui-Louise&quot;, which charted at No. 36 in the US and No. 26 in Canada, and performed well in other parts of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, &quot;Everything Is Grey&quot;. The release contained pop rock influences with greater use of keyboards than the first album. After BTO broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, &quot;On Strike&quot; in 1981.

Later in the article &quot;From Rags to Riches and Back&quot;, Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years, which he attributed to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.

=== 1980s–1990s and reunions ===
Bachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the &quot;American Woman&quot; era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled &quot;Bachman-Turner Overdrive&quot; in 1984, as well as a live album in 1986, after which they opened for Van Halen during the &quot;5150&quot; tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.

By 1988, Bachman-Turner Overdrive had reformed again, this time with the popular 1974–77 lineup. The band toured together until 1991, when Randy again departed. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the XIII Pan Am Games.

=== 2000s ===
Bachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman–Turner Overdrive band-mates, C. F. Turner and Robin Bachman. Series creator Matt Groening, whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, Homer Simpson humorously yells &quot;get to the working overtime part&quot; while they perform &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;.

In 2001, Bachman received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, along with the other members of The Guess Who. That year he won three SOCAN Classic Awards. In 2005, Bachman was awarded the Order of Manitoba, the highest award in the Province of Manitoba. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame for the first time, for his time with The Guess Who in 2001. In 2002, The Guess Who were recipients of The Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s foremost distinction for excellence in the performing arts. By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, Bachman Cummings.

In 2004, Bachman helped Kalan Porter on his debut album, &quot;219 Days&quot;. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during &quot;In Spite of It All&quot;. He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, &quot;And We Drive&quot;. During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, &quot;Jazz Thing&quot;.

By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot; on CBC Radio One. For the show, he played audio recordings, primarily Classic rock music, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. The show ran for 16 seasons with its final episode on Canada Day, July 1, 2021, after it was cancelled by CBC, though Bachman said he planned to take the program to another broadcaster or turn it into a podcast.

On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global Live 8 mega-concert organized by Bob Geldof. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Bachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the Bachman-Cummings Band. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called &quot;Every Song Tells A Story&quot;, where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and Burton Cummings performed throughout Canada as Bachman &amp; Cummings in the summer of 2006, while on tour with The Carpet Frogs. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new Bachman &amp; Turner album that was released in September 2010. The album&#x27;s single titled &quot;Rollin&#x27; Along&quot;, was released in June 2010 on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010–11) under their Bachman &amp; Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The pair released the next single, &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Is the Only Way Out&quot; on their official website.

=== The 2010s ===
Bachman was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame for the second time, now as a solo artist, in 2012. In June 2015, he received SOCAN&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2014, he released a home video package of his &quot;Every Song Tells A Story&quot; performances, which includes an occasional accompanying symphonic orchestra.

In 2015, he released an album titled &quot;Heavy Blues&quot; from his newly-formed band, Bachman. The album was influenced by classic 1960s blues rock and features musical contributions from other musicians including: Neil Young, Joe Bonamassa, Peter Frampton, Robert Randolph, and Jeff Healey. Later in March 2018, Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing versions of the latter&#x27;s hits. The album featured one original song titled &quot;Between Two Mountains&quot;, and also featured Walter Trout on the album&#x27;s version of &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.

Randy and Fred Turner continued to tour as Bachman &amp; Turner through 2018, when Fred amicably retired.

=== The 2020s ===
Bachman appeared in a CBC television broadcast benefit called &quot;Stronger Together, Tous Ensemble&quot; on April 26, 2020, featuring various Canadian musicians and entertainers. Bachman made a brief one-minute appearance to thank the front-line Canadian workers and proceeded to play a short parody of &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;.

== Guitar style ==

Bachman has stated that his guitar sound was influenced by his early violin studies, saying &quot;when I wanted to play a rock solo, I played like it was violin ... Violin is mostly slow, melodic stuff. So my guitar solos tend to be smooth, slow lines.&quot;

He has mentioned in interviews that his guitar influences include Lenny Breau, Leslie West, Wes Montgomery, George Peterson, and Hank Marvin.

== Personal life ==
Bachman&#x27;s first marriage was to Lorayne Stevenson (1966 to 1977). With Stevenson, Bachman had six children. His son, Tal Bachman, is a recording artist best known for his 1999 top-20 hit song &quot;She&#x27;s So High&quot;. His daughter Lorelei Bachman is also a writer/musician. He then was married to Denise McCann from 1982 to 2011, and they had one child. They resided on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada. Bachman and McCann separated in 2011.

During his early Guess Who years, Bachman&#x27;s Mormon religious beliefs conflicted with the sex, drugs and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lifestyle of the other band members. His son Tal Bachman later renounced the religion.

Bachman has struggled with obesity. He originally lost 60 pounds from 380 lb by diet and exercise. He became aware of the threat his obesity posed to his health during a performance at Winnipeg Stadium for the 1999 Pan American Games, realizing that his weight-induced back and knee pain was making touring impossible.

During an extended ground time following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Bachman began overeating again. At his next physical after the tour, his physician told him he was morbidly obese. He asked, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t morbid mean death?&quot; The physician told him of the risks he faced as a result of his obesity. Bachman remembered that Carnie Wilson, the daughter of his friend Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, had successfully lost weight using bariatric surgery, and sought out her surgeon to help him. Following surgery, he lost 155 pounds by 2006, reaching his 225 lb target weight.

Bachman also had a successful operation on his shoulder in November 2007 to repair a torn rotator cuff, which he has blamed on his decades-long use of heavy guitars.

Bachman has 26 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.

Bachman is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

In January 2023, Bachman announced on Twitter that his younger brother Robbie had died, but he did not specify a cause of death. In the statement, he also paid tribute to Jeff Beck, who died two days earlier, saying &quot;maybe Jeff Beck needs a drummer!&quot;

In May 2023, he announced in a tweet the deaths of his brothers Gary and Tim &quot;in quick succession since the pandemic.&quot;

=== Name pronunciation ===
Despite German-Canadian custom, Bachman says his surname is pronounced (with a short &#x27;a&#x27; sound as in &quot;back&quot;), and he uses this pronunciation when referring to himself. The more common pronunciation of , especially on American radio (where &quot;Bach-&quot; is pronounced the same as for J.S. Bach), became so widespread however, that he did not bother correcting people after BTO became popular.

<text>A tandem bicycle or twin is a bicycle (occasionally a tricycle) designed to be ridden by more than one person. The term tandem refers to the seating arrangement (fore to aft, not side by side), not the number of riders. Patents related to tandem bicycles date from the mid-1880s. Tandems can reach higher speeds than the same riders on single bicycles, and tandem bicycle racing exists. As with bicycles for single riders, there are many variations that have been developed over the years.

==Terminology==
The term tandem refers to the seating arrangement (fore to aft, not side by side), not the number of riders. A bike with two riders side by side is called a sociable.

Tandem bicycles are sometimes called &quot;Daisy Bells&quot;. This is in reference to &quot;Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)&quot; which is a popular song, written in 1892 by British songwriter Harry Dacre, with the well-known chorus, &quot;Daisy, Daisy / Give me your answer, do. / I&#x27;m half crazy / all for the love of you&quot;, ending with the words, &quot;a bicycle built for two&quot;.

On conventional tandems, the front rider steers as well as pedals the bicycle and is known as the &quot;captain&quot;, &quot;pilot&quot;, or &quot;steersman&quot;; the rear rider only pedals and is known as the &quot;stoker&quot;, &quot;navigator&quot; or &quot;rear admiral&quot;. On most tandems the two sets of cranks are mechanically linked by a timing chain and turn at the same rate.

==History==

Patents related to tandem bicycles date from the mid-1880s. In approximately 1898, Mikael Pedersen developed a two-rider tandem version of his Pedersen bicycle that weighed 24 pounds, and a four-rider, or &quot;quad&quot;, that weighed 64 pounds. They were also used in the Second Anglo-Boer War. Tandem popularity began to decline after World War II until a revival started in the late 1960s. In the UK The Tandem Club was founded in 1971, new tandems came on to the market from the French companies Lejeune and Gitane, and in the USA Bill McCready founded Santana Cycles in 1976. Modern technology has improved component and frame designs, and many tandems are as well-built as modern high-end road and off-road bikes.

== In popular culture ==
A song written in 1892 has a man asking &quot;Daisy Bell&quot; to marry him, saying, &quot;It won&#x27;t be a stylish marriage. I can&#x27;t afford a carriage. But you&#x27;ll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two!&quot;

In the Columbia Pictures comedy shorts, The Three Stooges occasionally ride on a tandem bicycle for their recurring gags.

In the BBC and LWT TV series, The Goodies are famously well known to ride their main tranportion, the tandem bicycle for travelling English countrysides and London.

==Performance==

Compared to a conventional bicycle, a tandem has double the pedalling power, without necessarily doubling the speed, and with only slightly more frictional loss in the drivetrain. It has about the same wind resistance as a conventional bicycle. High-performance tandems may weigh less than twice as much as a single bike, so the power-to-weight ratio may be slightly better than that of a single bike and rider. On flat terrain and downhill, most of the power produced by cyclists is used to overcome wind resistance, so tandems can reach higher speeds than the same riders on single bicycles. They are not necessarily slower on climbs, but are perceived as such, in part due to the need for a high level of coordination between the riders, especially if the physical abilities of the two riders are very different, requiring a compromise on cadence.

The tandem velomobile bicycle record was set at 83 km/h in 2013.

==Uses==
Tandem bicycles are used in competitions such as the Paralympics with blind and visually impaired cyclists riding as stokers with fully sighted captains.

Cycling at the Summer Olympics featured a men&#x27;s tandem event in 1908 and from 1920 to 1972.


Tandems may also be used for bicycle touring and may provide a solution to the problem of riders with different abilities that wish to tour together. Each rider may exert themselves as they wish and all riders travel at the same speed.

The UK has specialist time trial events that have National competition records over 10, 25, 50 and 100-mile events against the clock. There are also 12 and 24-hour time trials ran by the CTT and VTTA riders. There are also place to place records that are run by the RRA

==Variations==

===More than two riders===
Tandems can have more than two riders – tandem refers to the arrangement of the riders one behind the other rather than the number of riders. Bicycles for three, four, or five riders are referred to as &quot;triples&quot; or &quot;triplets&quot;, &quot;quads&quot; or &quot;quadruplets&quot;, and &quot;quints&quot; or &quot;quintuplets&quot; respectively. One such familiar to UK TV viewers was the &quot;trandem&quot; ridden by The Goodies. Originally a two-rider tandem with an extra &quot;dummy&quot; seat attached, a full three-rider version was built for them by Raleigh.

A marching band in Bruges, Belgium, uses a six-place tandem bicycle fitted to carry certain of their instruments in a way that allows them to play music while underway. In the &#x27;80s or &#x27;90s, an eight-seat tandem bicycle was built and demonstrated in Philadelphia.

===Independent pedaling===
Some designs such as the DaVinci can allow independent pedaling through the use of multiple freewheels. In another design, the rear rider steers and propels the rear wheel with pedals, and the front rider propels the front wheel with both hands and feet.

===Seating arrangements===
Tandems come with both upright and recumbent seating.

The Bilenky Viewpoint and the Hase Pino are hybrid upright/recumbent tandems steered by the captain who sits upright in the rear, while the stoker rides in a recumbent position in the front. Both also feature independent stoker pedaling.

The &quot;Buddy Bike&quot; is designed to allow a child to sit on the front saddle with an adult on the rear saddle and steering with extra-long handlebars.

===Double steering===
Both riders, in the case of just two, may be able to steer. The Star Cycle Company, of Wolverhampton, England, marketed its &quot;Combination Roadster tandem&quot; in 1896. It had a link from the second set of handlebars to the front fork. Others include the 1897 Geneva, and the 1898 Stearns.

===Tricycles===
Tandems are also available as tricycles; the conventional tandem trike has a small but devoted following in the United Kingdom and is available in one-wheel and two-wheel drive designs. Recumbent tandem tricycles are also gaining popularity throughout the world.

===Short wheelbase===
There are short wheelbase models, with the rear rider sitting over the rear wheel, either just in front of or even behind the rear axle.

===Folding===
Several manufacturers offer folding tandems, either with small wheels or not, to facilitate packing and travelling.

===Couplers===
It is possible to add couplers either during manufacturing or as a retrofit so that the frame can be disassembled into smaller pieces to facilitate packing and travel. Santana manufactures a &quot;triplet&quot; (or quad) that can be transformed into a tandem by simply removing the center section of the frame.&quot;

==Tandem specific components==
Tandems are subjected to unique stresses caused by additional riders and weight requiring solutions specific to tandem construction. The phrase &quot;Tandem Specific&quot; was popularized by its use in Santana tandem catalogs during the 1990s.

===Drive train===
To transfer power from all pedals to the rear wheel requires a drive train. Typically, the forward crankset is connected by a left-side timing chain to the rear crankset, which in turn is connected by a right-side chain to the rear wheel. This configuration is called crossover rear drive, and requires both of the rear cranks to have chainrings. To work reliably, both of the left-side cranks must be tandem- or left-drive specific to accept the left-hand threading used on left pedals.

The second most popular solution, due to not requiring tandem-specific cranks, is called single side rear drive. The forward crankset is connected by a right-side timing chain to the rear crankset, which in turn is connected by a right-side chain to the rear wheel. This requires that one of the rear chainrings be devoted to the timing chain and limits shifting options.

The least popular solution is to run a drive chain from the forward crankset all the way to the rear wheel, and also run a timing chain from the front crankset to the rear crankset. This is less popular because it requires considerably more chain than the first two arrangements. Such a setup is called a crossover front drive.

A rare solution to the requirement of coordinated pedaling is the use of a jackshaft plus two freehubs, thus allowing one rider to coast while the other continues to pedal. This also allows riders to select different crank positions, such as inphase (IP), or Out-Of-Phase (OOP), while pedaling together. Davinci Tandems use a unique &quot;Independent Drive&quot; whereby the intermediate shaft transfers the power from the stoker and captain cranks into a converter which allows up to four chainrings. This variant also allows stoker and captain cranks to freewheel (coast) independently.

===Crankset===
The front crankset typically has only one chainring. The rear crankset typically has many chainrings, sometimes on both sides. On a tandem where the pedaling is designed to be in sync, both cranksets will use a chainring for the timing chain of the same size. The drive chain chainrings can be single gear or use a derailleur.

To maintain the necessary tension on the timing chain, many tandems use an eccentric that is placed in the front rider&#x27;s bottom bracket shell. An alternate solution is to implement a pulley, or idler, on the bottom of the timing chain to take up slack. Idlers add friction and a potential point of failure to the drive train.

===Fork===
Tandems have very different weight distribution and loads on wheels, brakes, and forks. A tandem-specific fork is designed to handle this. Custom tandem makers such as Co-Motion make specific forks for tandem, triple, and quad-bikes. Brake forces can be substantial. On any bicycle, the front brake (and thus fork) are critical to safe and efficient braking. On disc brakes tandems, it is important that heat transfer and dissipation has been engineered properly. In particular, carbon tandem forks can provide all the benefits of comfort and control, but are also designed to handle the increased heat load.

===Handle bars and stem===
Stoker handlebars are typically connected to a stoker stem that is clamped around the captain&#x27;s seatpost. The stoker handlebars are typically bullhorns or drop bars with &quot;dummy levers&quot; instead of brake levers for gripping.

===Wheels===
Because of the extra weight and stresses, tandem wheels may use a higher spoke count, sturdier rims, higher pressure tires, a stronger freewheel, dishless spoke configuration, or asymmetric wheels. Tandems wear out rear wheels faster than front wheels; therefore, they may use non-symmetrical wheel setups, such as more spokes or a sturdier rim on the rear wheel.

The dish of a wheel measures the amount of asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160-mm-wide axle that allows a wheel that is completely &quot;dishless&quot; (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker&#x27;s cranks and may also cause &quot;heel-strike&quot; of the stoker&#x27;s shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145 mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in the strength of the wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle spindle. Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.

Specialty wheels such as Aerospoke or Shimano &quot;Sweet-16&quot; may build &quot;tandem certified&quot; racing wheelsets. The Aerospoke tandem wheelset is built up more than their roadset with special tandem hubs that can be removed and which facilitates stacking the rims flat into a travel case.

===Brakes===

A tandem bicycle has about twice the kinetic energy as a single bicycle traveling at the same forward speed. This may be more than can be handled by the same brakes, especially rim brakes, as a single bicycle. Two alternatives have been employed to solve this problem: drum brakes and disc brakes.

The Arai drum brake is used during long downhill descents where a rim brake might overheat the tire and possibly cause it to fail. The drum of the brake screws onto the left side of the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The shoe plate slips over the axle and a small reaction arm from the shoe plate engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.

Some modern tandems use disc brakes, with all the advantages and disadvantages that entails.

==Riding techniques==

The rear rider starts clipped in while the front rider holds the tandem upright. For those who can get accustomed to the rear rider always being clipped in, the distinct advantage to this technique will become obvious when trying to start at the foot of a bridge or on a hill. If the tandem team does not practice this, then they often reserve this type of start for when they are faced with a bridge or hill. This technique allows the rear rider to apply continuous power as the front rider steadies the tandem during the initial take-off. This reduces the risk of the tandem toppling over due to starting on an incline. The rear rider will continue to pedal as the front rider attempts to get the foot used for steadying the tandem clipped into the pedal.

===Crank phase===
Riders may choose to synchronise their pedalling through in-phase (IP) or out-of-phase (OOP) pedalling. In in-phase pedalling, each rider&#x27;s cranks are the same or opposite clock positions at any point in time. In out-of-phase pedalling, both riders have their cranks in differing non-opposite positions. This has the potential for a wide range of variation. Some tandem riders arrange their cranks so that they are 90° out of phase to produce what is called the &quot;4 banger arrangement&quot;. In practice, OOP setups range from a mere two-tooth phase difference between cranks to a full 90° phase difference. Generally, OOP provides the greatest benefits to the tandem team that has disparate leg-strength. When the tandem is pedalled IP it is possible, and often happens, that the stronger rider literally drops the pedals out from beneath the feet of the weaker rider and cause the latter to be unable to contribute meaningfully. Using OOP makes a significant difference in gearing choice as each rider has the full mass of the tandem in their power stroke, so lower gears are preferred. However, using OOP can help develop leg strength for the very same reason. Some argue that this produces a smoother power stroke, or that it reduces stress on the drive train because the point of maximum power is reduced to roughly half and distributed over the chainrings.

==Manufacturers==

Since the market for tandem bicycles is significantly smaller than the market for single bikes, there are far fewer tandem bicycle manufacturers than single-bicycle manufacturers. There are a few builders who specialize in tandems, as well as single-bike makers who offer tandem models. Current notable tandem bicycle manufacturers include:

<doc id="86683" wikidata="Q57307" url="?curid=86683" title="Annette von Droste-Hülshoff">
<text>Baroness Anna Elisabeth Franziska Adolphine Wilhelmine Louise Maria von Droste zu Hülshoff, known as Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (; 10 January 179724 May 1848), was a 19th-century German poet, novelist, and composer of Classical music. She was also the author of the novella &quot;Die Judenbuche&quot;.

In an article for the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Francis Joste wrote, &quot;The fame of the poetess rests chiefly on her lyric poems, her pastorales, and her ballads. In the poetic representation of nature, few can equal her. The poetical works of Annette von Droste-Hülshoff are imperishable. What makes them so is their originality, the proof that they are the works of a genius. It is this too that gained for their author the well-earned title of &#x27;Germany&#x27;s greatest poetess.&#x27;&quot;

==Biography==
===Early years===
Annette von Droste-Hülshoff was born at the castle of Burg Hülshoff (now a part of Havixbeck) in the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. Her family, the Barons Droste zu Hülshoff, belonged to the oldest Roman Catholic aristocracy of Westphalia. Her father Clemens August von Droste zu Hülshoff (1760–1826) was a learned man who was interested in ancient history and languages, ornithology, botany, music and the supernatural. Her mother Therese Luise (1772–1853) came from another aristocratic Westphalian family, the Barons von Haxthausen. Annette was the second of four children: she had an elder sister Maria Anna (nicknamed &quot;Jenny&quot;, 1795–1859) and two younger brothers, Werner Konstantin (1798–1867) and Ferdinand (1800–1829). Annette was born one month prematurely and only saved by the intervention of a nurse. She suffered from problems with her health throughout her life, including headaches and eye troubles.

Droste was educated by private tutors in ancient languages, French, natural history, mathematics and music (she inherited considerable musical talent from her father). She began to write as a child; 50 poems written between 1804 and 1814 have been preserved. Droste&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Baron Werner Adolf von Haxthausen, had remarried after the death of Annette&#x27;s grandmother in 1772 and built himself a new castle, Schloss Bökerhof, in the village of Bökendorf, Paderborn. Here his sons from his second marriage, Werner and August, had formed an intellectual circle. They were in contact with such celebrated cultural figures as the Brothers Grimm, Clemens Brentano, Friedrich Schlegel, Adele and Johanna Schopenhauer. Droste visited Schloss Bökerhof frequently and made the acquaintance of Wilhelm Grimm. She and her sister contributed folk tales from Westphalia to the Grimms&#x27; famous collection of fairy stories. However, neither Grimm nor her uncles gave any encouragement to her literary ambitions. The only literary figure to recognize her talent was Anton Matthias Sprickmann (1749–1833), whom she first met in 1812. Sprickmann was the founder of the theatre in Münster and had known important 18th-century poets Matthias Claudius and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. Droste trusted Sprickmann&#x27;s judgement and showed him many of her early works, including the unfinished tragedy &quot;Berta oder die Alpen&quot; (&quot;Berta, or The Alps&quot;, 1813). Other examples of her juvenilia are the tale in verse &quot;Walter&quot; (1818) and a novel &quot;Ledwina&quot; (begun in 1819 but never completed).

In 1819–1820, Annette spent a year staying with the Haxthausen family at Schloss Bökerhof, interrupted only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped to find a cure for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a Lutheran law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her uncle Baron August von Haxthausen. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that Annette&#x27;s Aunt, Baroness Anna von Haxthausen (who was in fact four years her junior), and other relatives at Schloss Bökerhof disapproved of Annette&#x27;s decision to have a serious relationship with a commoner. For this reason, the Baroness von Haxthausen masterminded a society intrigue intended to destroy the relationship in a very public manner. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, August von Arnswaldt, a Lutheran aristocrat with literary ambitions, pretended to pursue Annette romantically. At first flattered by von Arnswaldt&#x27;s attentions, Annette gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she was committed to Heinrich Straube. By this time it was too late, as von Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He traveled to Göttingen and gave Straube proof of Annette&#x27;s behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, August von Arnswaldt married a widowed Baroness Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Annette&#x27;s hair was found among his possessions. The ensuing scandal was a catastrophe for Annette and severely damaged both her reputation and her marriage prospects. Feeling betrayed by the role that her own relatives had played, Annette refused to visit Schloss Bökerhof for the next 18 years.

Droste&#x27;s earliest poems are derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work began to show marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of Christian poetry, &quot;Das geistliche Jahr&quot; (&quot;The Spiritual Year&quot;). Droste intended to write one poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant as a gift to her devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they showed too many traces of major depression and spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even then she did not publish the poems and they only appeared posthumously in 1851.

When her father died in 1826 she moved with her mother and sister to a small country estate near Hülshoff called Rüschhaus. Here she led a constricted, monotonous existence, broken only by a few trips to the Rhine and Bonn. She composed poetry, but not prolifically. In 1834 her sister Jenny married Baron Joseph von Laßberg, an important collector, editor, and publisher of medieval Middle High German epic poetry. The following summer, Annette and her mother travelled to visit Baron von Laßberg&#x27;s estate of Schloss Eppishausen in the Swiss Alps. She was inspired by the scenery and easily befriended her brother in law, but neither he nor his friends shared her interest in modern German poetry and Droste&#x27;s hopes that the Baron might publish her work came to nothing.

Droste now entrusted the publication of her first book to two friends, Christoph Bernhard Schlüter and Wilhelm Junkmann. They had little experience of the literary world and chose the Münster-based publisher Aschendorff. Droste would have preferred a non-regional publisher rather than a Westphalian one as Westphalia had a reputation as a cultural backwater and few people bought books there. The collection appeared in 1838 in a print-run of 500 copies, of which only 74 were sold. It contained three long narrative poems (&quot;Das Hospiz auf dem großem Saint-Bernard&quot;, &quot;Das Vermächtnis des Arztes&quot; and &quot;Die Schlacht in Loener Bruch&quot;) and a handful of lyrics. Although they were issued under the name &quot;Annette Elisabeth von D.H.&quot;, her family did not approve. Droste found the failure of her book &quot;humiliating.&quot;

===Literary success===
The year 1840 marked a turning point in her career, however. In 1838, Droste had begun to frequent a literary salon in Münster, presided over by Elise Rüdiger, the &quot;Hecken-Schriftstellergesellschaft.&quot; One of its members was the young poet Levin Schücking. Droste had known his mother, the poet Katharina Schücking-Busch, and had first met Levin in 1831. Schücking had also published an admiring review of Droste&#x27;s poetry collection and sought her help in writing his own book, &quot;Das malerische und romantische Westfalen&quot; (&quot;Picturesque and Romantic Westphalia&quot;, 1840). The two soon formed a close friendship and Droste wrote a number of ballads for inclusion in the book, among them &quot;Das Fräulein von Rodenschild&quot; and &quot;Der Tod des Erzbischofs Engelbert von Köln&quot;. Schücking encouraged her renewed literary creativity. In the winter of 1840—1841 she wrote her famous novella &quot;Die Judenbuche&quot; (&quot;The Jew&#x27;s Beech&quot;, published 1842), inspired by a real murder near Bökerhof in the late 18th century. The following autumn and winter, Droste and Schücking stayed at her brother-in-law&#x27;s castle at Meersburg on Lake Constance, where Schücking had been given the task of cataloguing Baron von Laßberg&#x27;s private library. While there, Schücking told Annette that her talent lay in lyric poetry, which relied on rare moments of inspiration. Droste disagreed: she had no problem composing poetry in her head but had difficulty writing it down and the failure of her first book had not encouraged her to make the effort. Now she had a sympathetic reader in Schücking, she began to write in earnest, producing about fifty poems between October 1841 and April 1842. They include poems dedicated to Schücking, often on the theme of ageing (e.g. &quot;Kein Wort&quot;, &quot;O frage nicht&quot;), and poems of self-analysis such as &quot;Das Spiegelbild&quot; (&quot;The Image in the Mirror&quot;) and &quot;Die Taxuswand&quot; (&quot;The Yew Hedge&quot;), which looks back to her unhappy love affair with Straube. Other lyrics are the nature poems collected in the cycle &quot;Heidebilder&quot; (&quot;Heath Pictures&quot;), including such famous pieces as &quot;Die Krähen&quot; (&quot;The Crows&quot;), &quot;Der Hünenstein&quot;, &quot;Die Mergelgrube&quot; (&quot;The Marl Pit&quot;) and &quot;Der Knabe im Moor&quot; (&quot;The Boy on the Moor&quot;). These often have an element of magical realism and supernatural terror.

In April 1842, Schücking left Schloss Meersburg to take up a job as a tutor to an aristocratic family. Droste returned to Rüschhaus the same summer. The pair would never be so close again. Droste&#x27;s literary productivity declined, but she did compose a few more poems, including the supernatural story &quot;Spiritus familiaris.&quot; In September 1844, the prestigious publisher Cotta issued a large collection of her poems from the 1840s. This time Droste enjoyed great success and the book received admiring reviews from many important intellectual figures.

In 1844, Classical music composer Robert Schuman had become an admirer of her poetry, which he praised in a letter to Hans Christian Andersen. However, the poet declined Clara Schumann&#x27;s request for an opera libretto on her husband&#x27;s behalf, but Robert Schumann did set Annette von Droste-Hülshoff&#x27;s poem, &quot;Das Hirtenfeuer&quot;, as Op. 59 no. 5. In time, Droste was acknowledged as the greatest female German author of the 19th century.

===Final years===
Meanwhile, her relationship with Schücking had cooled. In 1843, Schücking had married Baroness Louise von Gall. When the couple visited Schloss Meersburg for four weeks in May 1844, the two women intensely disliked one another. Droste published a poem &quot;Lebt wohl&quot; (&quot;Farewell&quot;) in the literary journal &quot;Morgenblatt&quot;, effectively saying goodbye to Schücking. Schücking also used his own literary works to mark his distance from Droste. In 1846, he published two novels. The first, &quot;Die Ritterbürtigen&quot;, contained a highly critical portrait of the Westphalian aristocracy. This caused Droste embarrassment as Schücking had made use of private information from conversations with her. The second novel, &quot;Eine dunkle Tat&quot;, included characters resembling himself and Droste. The character of Katharina, based on Droste, is maternal, controlling, possessive, and treats the protagonist as a substitute child. As a result of these publications and her dislike of Schücking&#x27;s radical politics, Droste made a decisive break with him. Nevertheless, after Droste&#x27;s death, Schücking helped publicise her works, publishing the collection of her final poems, &quot;Letzte Gaben&quot;, in 1860 and an edition of her collected works in 1878–9. Important poems from her last years include &quot;Mondesaufgang&quot; (&quot;Moonrise&quot;), &quot;Durchwachte Nacht&quot; (&quot;Sleepless Night&quot;) and &quot;Im Grase&quot; (&quot;In the Grass&quot;).
The profits from her book had helped Droste to buy a small vine-covered villa known as Fürstenhäusle in Meersburg, while renovating the house, she lived in her brother in law&#x27;s Schloss from 1846 until her death in May 1848, probably from tuberculosis.

==Character of her poetry==
The critic Margaret Atkinson wrote: 

==Musical activity==
Droste received early instruction in piano and later in singing. In 1821, she was given a composition manual, &quot;Einige Erklärungen über den General-Baß&quot;, written by her uncle Maximilian-Friedrich von Droste zu Hülshoff (a friend of Joseph Haydn).

==In popular culture ==
* In her native Havixbeck, the castle that is Droste&#x27;s birthplace, Burg Hülshoff, is now a museum with a retrospective of her work and is open to the public.
* Asteroid 12240 Droste-Hülshoff, discovered by astronomer Freimut Börngen in 1988, was named in her memory.
* Annette von Droste-Hülshoff is the protagonist of Karen Duve&#x27;s novel &quot;Fräulein Nettes kurzer Sommer&quot;, Galiani, Berlin 2018, .
* Annette von Droste-Hülshoff has inspired many young English poets on their Grand Tour travels like Lord Byron and Shelley. Her room in Castle of Meersburg and her tiny house nearby the Bodensee (above) is often visited by romantic poets and folk songwriters even in the 21st Century: like Royal Alpine Poet and Brexitland Anthem song writer in 52 Love Letters from the Lake.

<text>Winona LaDuke (born August 18, 1959) is an American environmentalist, writer, and industrial hemp grower, known for her work on tribal land claims and preservation, as well as sustainable development.

In 1996 and 2000, she ran for vice president of the United States as the nominee of the Green Party of the United States, on a ticket headed by Ralph Nader. Until 2023 she was the executive director and a co-founder (along with the Indigo Girls) of Honor the Earth, a Native environmental advocacy organization that played an active role in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.

In 2016, she received an electoral vote for vice president. In doing so, she became the first Green Party member to receive an electoral vote.

==Early life and education==

Winona (meaning &quot;first daughter&quot; in Dakota language) LaDuke was born in 1959 in Los Angeles, California, to Betty Bernstein and Vincent LaDuke (later known as Sun Bear). Her father was from the Ojibwe White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, and her mother of Jewish European ancestry from The Bronx, New York. LaDuke spent some of her childhood in Los Angeles, but was primarily raised in Ashland, Oregon. Due to her father&#x27;s heritage, she was enrolled at birth with the White Earth Nation, but did not live at White Earth, or any other reservation, until 1982. She started work at White Earth after graduating from college when she got a job there as principal of the high school.

After her parents married, Vincent LaDuke worked as an actor in Hollywood in supporting roles in Western movies, while Betty LaDuke completed her academic studies. The couple separated when Winona was five, and her mother took a position as an art instructor at Southern Oregon College, now Southern Oregon University at Ashland, then a small logging and college town near the California border. In the 1980s, Vincent reinvented himself as a New Age spiritual leader by the name Sun Bear.

While growing up in Ashland, LaDuke attended public school and was on the debate team in high school. She attended Harvard University, where she joined a group of Indigenous activists, and graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics (rural economic development). When she moved to White Earth, she did not know the Ojibwe language, or many people, and was not quickly accepted. While working as the principal of the local Minnesota reservation high school she completed research for her master&#x27;s thesis on the reservation&#x27;s subsistence economy and became involved in local issues. She completed an M.A. in community economic development through Antioch University&#x27;s distance-learning program.

==Career and activism==

While attending Harvard, LaDuke heard a presentation by Jimmie Durham that she said &quot;shook something loose&quot; in her and changed her life. She worked for Durham, investigating the effects of uranium mining in Navajo reservations. After graduating, she moved to her father&#x27;s community at White Earth, where she found work as the high school principal. In 1985 she helped found the Indigenous Women&#x27;s Network. She worked with Women of All Red Nations to publicize American forced sterilization of Native American women.

Next she became involved in the struggle to recover lands for the Anishinaabe. An 1867 treaty with the United States provided a territory of more than 860,000 acres for the White Earth Indian Reservation. Under the Nelson Act of 1889, an attempt to have the Anishinaabe assimilate by adopting a European-American model of subsistence farming, communal tribal land was allotted to individual households. The US classified any excess land as surplus, allowing it to be sold to non-natives. In addition, many Anishinaabe sold their land individually over the years; these factors caused the tribe to lose control of most of its land. By the mid-20th century, the tribe held only one-tenth of the land in its reservation.

===White Earth Land Recovery Project===
In 1989, LaDuke founded the White Earth Land Recovery Project (WELRP) in Minnesota with the proceeds of a human rights award from Reebok. Its goal is to buy back land in the reservation that non-Natives bought and to create enterprises that provide work to Anishinaabe. By 2000, the foundation had bought 1,200 acres, which it held in a conservation trust for eventual cession to the tribe. WELRP also works to reforest the land and revive cultivation of wild rice, long a traditional Ojibwe food. It markets that and other traditional products, including hominy, jam, buffalo sausage, and other products. It has started an Ojibwe language program, a herd of buffalo, and a wind-energy project. It produces and sells traditional foods and crafts through its label, Native Harvest. The Evergreen State College class of 2014 chose LaDuke as its commencement speaker. She delivered her address at the school on June 13, 2014.

===Honor the Earth, 1993-2023===
LaDuke was also the executive director of Honor the Earth, an organization she co-founded with the non-Native folk-rock duo the Indigo Girls in 1993. Honor the Earth is a national advocacy group encouraging public support and funding for Native environmental groups. It works nationally and internationally on issues of climate change, renewable energy, sustainable development, food systems and environmental justice. Members of Honor the Earth were active in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. As of 2016, the organization&#x27;s mission was:

to create awareness and support for Native environmental issues and to develop needed financial and political resources for the survival of sustainable Native communities. Honor the Earth develops these resources by using music, the arts, the media, and Indigenous wisdom to ask people to recognize our joint dependency on the Earth and be a voice for those not heard.

On March 30, 2023, the Becker County, Minnesota, District Court ordered Honor the Earth and LaDuke to pay a former employee $750,000 in damages in a sexual harassment and abuse complaint, based on actions from 2015. LaDuke resigned from the organization on April 5, 2023, acknowledging her failure to protect victims of sexual harassment.

===Political career, 1996-2016===

In 1996 and 2000, LaDuke ran as the vice-presidential candidate with Ralph Nader on the Green Party ticket. She was not endorsed by any tribal council or other tribal government. LaDuke endorsed the Democratic Party ticket for president and vice-president in 2004, 2008, and 2012.

In 2016, Robert Satiacum, Jr., a faithless elector from Washington, cast his presidential vote for Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle and his vice-presidential vote for LaDuke, making her the first Green Party member and the first Native American woman to receive an Electoral College vote for vice president.

In 2016, LaDuke was involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, participating at the resistance camps in North Dakota and speaking to the media on the issue.

At the July 2019 National Audubon Convention in Milwaukee, LaDuke gave the keynote address with updates on efforts to stop the Sandpiper pipeline, other pipelines, and other projects near Ojibwe waters and through the Leech Lake Reservation. She urged everyone to be water protectors and stand up for their rights.

In 2020 and 2021, she was a leader of the protests against the Line 3 pipeline.

=== Hemp activism ===
As of 2018, LaDuke operated a 40-acre (16 ha) industrial hemp farm on the White Earth Indian Reservation, growing hemp varieties from different regions of the world, vegetables and tobacco. She has said that she turned to industrial hemp farming after being urged to investigate the practice for several years and advocates its potential to turn the American economy away from fossil fuels. LaDuke has promoted the growth of both marijuana and industrial hemp on Indigenous tribal lands for financial profit and the localization of the economy. Her position can be considered controversial given experiences of other reservations, such as the Oglala Sioux Tribe, who were raided by the DEA in relation to hemp farming.

==Personal life==
In 1988, LaDuke married Cree Randy Kapashesit of Moose Factory, Ontario, Canada. They separated in 1992.

On November 9, 2008, LaDuke&#x27;s house in Ponsford, Minnesota, burned down while she was in Boston. No one was injured, but all her personal property burned, including her extensive library and Indigenous art and artifact collection.
As of 2020, she had one son and six grandchildren.

<text>Mohammad &quot;Azhar&quot; Azharuddin (born 8 February 1963) is an Indian politician and a former cricketer who also served as the Indian national cricket team&#x27;s captain. He was a right-handed middle order batter and an occasional medium fast bowler. He played 99 Test matches and 334 One Day Internationals for India. As a captain, he led the team to wins in the 1990-91 and 1995 Asia Cups and reached the semi-finals of the 1996 Cricket World Cup. He was considered as one of the best ODI batsmen in the world and one of the greatest of his era. He captained India in three Cricket World Cups, the most by any Indian captain, all during the 1990s. He was also a part of the Indian squad which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket.

His cricketing career came to an abrupt end in 2000 after he was banned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for life due to his alleged involvement in a match fixing scandal. In 2012, the Andhra Pradesh High Court lifted the life ban after appeal. In September 2019, he was elected as the president of Hyderabad Cricket Association.

In 2009, Azharuddin joined Indian National Congress and was elected as a member of parliament for Moradabad. He was appointed as the President of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee in 2018.

Azharuddin married Naureen in 1987 and they had two sons, Mohammad Asaduddin and Mohammad Ayazuddin. In 1996, he divorced Naureen and married actress Sangeeta Bijlani. After Azharuddin&#x27;s rumored affairs with multiple people, notably badminton player Jwala Gutta, Sangeeta filed for a divorce in 2010. His younger son Ayazuddin died in a bike accident in 2011.

During India&#x27;s tour of England in 1990, Azharuddin scored 121 in the first test at Lord&#x27;s in 1990. Though India lost the match, former England cricketer Vic Marks called it &quot;the most dazzling Test century&quot; he had ever witnessed, in his column for &quot;The Observer&quot;. In the second Test in Manchester, Azharuddin scored his tenth century in tests with a 179 runs while putting on a 112-run stand with Sachin Tendulkar in the first innings. Playing his 39th Test, he reached his 10th Test century off 155 balls. Azharuddin ended the series with 426 runs at an average of 85.20 which was the highest tally by an India captain in a test series in England until it was broken by Virat Kohli in 2018.

===Asia cup victories and World cups===
Azharuddin led India to victory in the 1990–91 Asia Cup beating Sri Lanka in the final. He scored 54 runs in the final and was awarded the Man of the match award.

India won the 1995 Asia Cup beating Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in the final where Azharuddin captained the side and won the man of the match scoring runs. Azharuddin again led the team in the 1996 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by India. India finished in third place in the group stage, qualifying for the quarter finals where they beat Pakistan by 39 runs to make it to the semi finals. India lost in the semifinals to Sri Lanka after the match was abandoned mid way due to crowd trouble when India were eight wickets down for 120 runs in response to Sri Lanka&#x27;s score of 251/8.

===Later years===
During the second test of South Africa&#x27;s India tour in 1996–97 at Kolkata, Azharuddin scored a century off 74 deliveries equaling Kapil Dev&#x27;s record for the fastest test century by an India player and fourth overall, in terms of balls faced. Azharuddin scored another century in the next test making an unbeaten 163 and helped India record their biggest win in Test history in terms of runs (280) at the time. He was named the man of the match and the series after aggregating 388 runs at an average of 77.60 Azharuddin scored seven centuries in ODIs with a best of 153 coming against Zimbabwe on 9 April 1998 in Cuttack.

Azharuddin played the final match of his international career in an ODI against Pakistan on 3 June 2000 in the 2000 Asia Cup.

Then captain of South Africa Hansie Cronje stated that Azharuddin was the one to introduce him to bookies. International Cricket Council and BCCI banned Azharuddin for life based on a report by Central Bureau of Investigation.

In 2003, a trial court upheld the lifetime ban but it was later overturned on 8 November 2012 by a divisional bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. In 2019, Azhar was elected as the president of Hyderabad Cricket Association.

==Playing style==
Azharuddin was a right handed middle order batter and an occasional medium fast bowler. He was known for his graceful and fluid batting style. John Woodcock, a cricket writer, said of him, &quot;It&#x27;s no use asking an Englishman to bat like Mohammad Azharuddin. It would be like expecting a greyhound to win The Derby.&quot; Former cricketer and umpire Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan stated that &quot;Azharuddin had the best wrists in the game&quot;. Mike Atherton and Angus Fraser said Azharuddin&#x27;s &quot;genius was second only to Brian Lara among batsmen of their generation.&quot;

<doc id="86692" wikidata="Q41718" url="?curid=86692" title="Emiliano Zapata">
<text>Emiliano Zapata Salazar (; 8 August 1879 – 10 April 1919) was a Mexican revolutionary. He was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, the main leader of the people&#x27;s revolution in the Mexican state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called &quot;Zapatismo&quot;.

Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco, in an era when peasant communities came under increasing repression from the small-landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugarcane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Díaz (President from 1877 to 1880 and 1884 to 1911). Zapata early on participated in political movements against Díaz and the landowning &quot;hacendados&quot;, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he became a leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders, he formed the Liberation Army of the South, of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Zapata&#x27;s forces contributed to the fall of Díaz, defeating the Federal Army in the Battle of Cuautla in May 1911, but when the revolutionary leader Francisco I. Madero became president he disavowed the role of the Zapatistas, denouncing them as mere bandits.

In November 1911, Zapata promulgated the Plan de Ayala, which called for substantial land reforms, redistributing lands to the peasants. Madero sent the Federal Army to root out the Zapatistas in Morelos. Madero&#x27;s generals employed a scorched-earth policy, burning villages and forcibly removing their inhabitants, and drafting many men into the Army or sending them to forced-labor camps in southern Mexico. Such actions strengthened Zapata&#x27;s standing among the peasants, and succeeded in driving the forces of Madero, led by Victoriano Huerta, out of Morelos. In a coup against Madero in February 1913, Huerta took power in Mexico, but a coalition of Constitutionalist forces in northern Mexico, led by Venustiano Carranza, Álvaro Obregón and Francisco &quot;Pancho&quot; Villa, ousted him in July 1914 with the support of Zapata&#x27;s troops. Zapata did not recognize the authority that Carranza asserted as leader of the revolutionary movement, continuing his adherence to the Plan de Ayala.

In the aftermath of the revolutionaries&#x27; victory over Huerta, they attempted to sort out power relations in the Convention of Aguascalientes (October to November 1914). Zapata and Villa broke with Carranza, and Mexico descended into a civil war among the winners. Dismayed with the alliance with Villa, Zapata focused his energies on rebuilding society in Morelos (which he now controlled), instituting the land reforms of the Plan de Ayala. As Carranza consolidated his power and defeated Villa in 1915, Zapata initiated guerrilla warfare against the Carrancistas, who in turn invaded Morelos, employing once again scorched-earth tactics to oust the Zapatista rebels. Zapata re-took Morelos in 1917 and held most of the state against Carranza&#x27;s troops until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. After his death, Zapatista generals aligned with Obregón against Carranza and helped drive Carranza from power. In 1920, Zapatistas obtained important positions in the government of Morelos after Carranza&#x27;s fall, instituting many of the land reforms envisioned by Zapata.

Zapata remains an iconic figure in Mexico, used both as a nationalist symbol as well as a symbol of the neo-Zapatista movement. Article 27 of the 1917 Mexican Constitution was drafted in response to Zapata&#x27;s agrarian demands.

== Life and career ==
=== 1879–1909: Early life ===
Emiliano Zapata was born to Gabriel Zapata and Cleofas Jertrudiz Salazar of Anenecuilco, Morelos, the ninth of ten children. Contrary to popular legend, the Zapatas were a well-known local family and reasonably well-off. Emiliano&#x27;s maternal grandfather, José Salazar, had served in the army of José María Morelos y Pavón during the siege of Cuautla, while his paternal uncles Cristino and José Zapata fought in the Reform War and the French Intervention. Emiliano&#x27;s godfather was the manager of a large local hacienda and his godmother was the manager&#x27;s wife. The Zapata family were descended from the Zapata of Mapaztlán and were likely mestizos, Mexicans of both Spanish and Nahua heritage. Although it is not known conclusively whether Zapata himself spoke Nahuatl, historian Miguel León-Portilla has cited later Zapatista proclamations and eyewitness accounts to argue that he was fluent in the language.

Gabriel Zapata was a farmer and horse trainer, and Emiliano&#x27;s upbringing on the farm gave him an intimate familiarity with the difficulties of the countryside and his village&#x27;s long struggle to regain the land taken by expanding haciendas. He received a limited education from his teacher, Emilio Vara, but it included &quot;the rudiments of bookkeeping&quot;. Gabriel died when Emiliano was about 16 or 17, leaving the latter to care for his family. Emiliano was entrepreneurial and bought a team of mules to haul maize from farms to town and bricks to the Hacienda of Chinameca; he was also a successful farmer, growing watermelons as a cash crop. He was a skilled horseman and competed in rodeos and races, as well as bullfighting from horseback. These skills as a horseman brought him work as a horse trainer for Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s son-in-law, Ignacio de la Torre y Mier who had a large sugar hacienda nearby. Emiliano had a striking appearance, with a large mustache in which he took pride, and good quality clothing described by his loyal secretary: &quot;General Zapata&#x27;s dress until his death was a &quot;charro&quot; outfit: tight-fitting black cashmere pants with silver buttons, a broad charro hat, a fine linen shirt or jacket, a scarf around his neck, boots of a single piece, Amozoqueña-style spurs, and a pistol at his belt.&quot; In an undated studio photo, Zapata is dressed in a standard business suit and tie, projecting an image of a man of means.

Around the turn of the 20th century, Anenecuilco was a mixed Spanish-speaking mestizo and indigenous Nahuatl-speaking town. It had a long history of protesting the local haciendas taking community members&#x27; land, and its leaders gathered colonial-era documentation of their land titles to prove their claims. Some of the colonial documentation was in Nahuatl, with contemporary translations to Spanish for use in legal cases in the Spanish courts. As referenced above, one eyewitness account by Luz Jiménez of Milpa Alta states that Emiliano Zapata spoke Nahuatl fluently when his forces arrived in her community.

Community members in Anenecuilco, including Zapata, sought redress against land seizures. In 1892, a delegation had an audience with Díaz, who with the intervention of a lawyer, agreed to hear them. Although promising them to deal favorably with their petition, Díaz had them arrested and Zapata was conscripted into the Federal Army. Under Díaz, conscription into the Federal Army was much feared by ordinary Mexican men and their families. Zapata was one of many rebel leaders who were conscripted at some point.

=== 1909–1910: First political forays ===
In 1909, an important meeting was called by the elders of Anenecuilco, whose chief elder was José Merino. He announced &quot;my intention to resign from my position due to my old age and limited abilities to continue the fight for the land rights of the village.&quot; The meeting was used as a time for discussion and nomination of individuals as a replacement for Merino as the president of the village council. The elders on the council were so well respected by the village men that no one would dare to override their nominations or vote for an individual against the advice of the current council at that time. The nominations made were Modesto González, Bartolo Parral, and Emiliano Zapata. After the nominations were closed, a vote was taken and Zapata became the new council president without contest.

Although Zapata had turned 30 only a month before, voters knew that it was necessary to elect someone respected by the community who would be responsible for the village. Even though he was relatively young, Anenecuilco was ready to hand over the leadership to him without any worry of failure. Before he was elected he had shown the village his nature by helping to lead a campaign in opposition to the candidate Díaz had chosen governor. Even though Zapata&#x27;s efforts failed, he was able to create and cultivate relationships with political authority figures that would prove useful for him.

Zapata became a leading figure in the village of Anenecuilco, where his family had lived for many generations, though he did not take the title of Don, as was custom for someone of his status. Instead, the Anenecuilcans referred to Zapata affectionately as &quot;Miliano&quot; and later as &quot;pobrecito&quot; (poor little thing) after his death.

=== Mexican Revolution ===
==== 1910–1912: Maderista revolution and plan of Ayala ====
The flawed 1910 elections were a major reason for the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Porfirio Díaz was being threatened by the candidacy of Francisco I. Madero. Zapata, seeing an opportunity to promote land reform in Mexico, joined with Madero and his Constitutionalists, who included Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa, whom he perceived to be the best chance for genuine change in the country. Although he was wary of Madero, Zapata cooperated with him when Madero made vague promises about land reform in his Plan of San Luis Potosí. Land reform was the central feature of Zapata&#x27;s political vision.

Zapata joined Madero&#x27;s campaign against President Díaz. The first military campaign of Zapata was the capture of the Hacienda of Chinameca. When Zapata&#x27;s army captured Cuautla after a six-day battle on 19 May 1911, it became clear that Díaz would not hold on to power for long.

During his interim presidency, Francisco León de la Barra tasked General Victoriano Huerta to suppress revolutionaries in Morelos. Huerta was to disarm revolutionaries peacefully if possible, but could use force. In August 1911, Huerta led 1,000 Federal troops to Cuernavaca, which Madero saw as provocative. Writing the Minister of the Interior, Zapata demanded the Federal troops withdraw from Morelos, saying &quot;I won&#x27;t be responsible for the blood that is going to flow if the Federal forces remain.&quot;

Although Madero&#x27;s Plan of San Luis Potosí specified the return of village land and won the support of peasants seeking land reform, he was not ready to implement radical change. Madero simply demanded that &quot;Public servants act &#x27;morally&#x27; in enforcing the law ...&quot;. Upon seeing the response by villagers, Madero offered formal justice in courts to individuals who had been wronged by others with regard to agrarian politics. Zapata decided that on the surface it seemed as though Madero was doing good things for the people of Mexico, but Zapata did not know the level of sincerity in Madero&#x27;s actions and thus did not know if he should support him completely.

Compromises between the Madero and Zapata failed in November 1911, days after Madero was elected president. Zapata believed that Madero was abandoning the principles of the revolution, prioritizing his own political ambitions, and repressing those who demanded land reform.Zapata declared Madero illegitimate, calling for his removal and proposing Pascual Orozco, and later Zapata himself, as the rightful revolutionary leader.
Zapata vowed that his forces would continue fighting until the original revolutionary goals were met, refusing compromises with the existing government. Zapata and Otilio Montaño Sánchez, a former school teacher, fled to the mountains of southwest Puebla. There they promulgated the most radical reform plan in Mexico, the Plan de Ayala (Plan of Ayala). The plan declared Madero a traitor, named as head of the revolution Pascual Orozco, the victorious general who captured Ciudad Juárez in 1911 forcing the resignation of Díaz. He outlined a plan for true land reform.

Zapata had supported the ouster of Díaz and had the expectation that Madero would fulfill the promises made in the Plan of San Luis Potosí to return village lands. He did not share Madero&#x27;s vision of democracy built on particular freedoms and guarantees that were meaningless to peasants:

 Freedom of the press for those who cannot read; free elections for those who do not know the candidates; proper legal for those who have anything to do with an attorney. All those democratic principles, all those great words that gave such joy to our fathers and grandfathers have lost their magic for the people ... With or without elections, with or without an effective law, with the Porfirian dictatorship or with Madero&#x27;s democracy with a controlled or free press, its fate remains the same.

The 1911 Plan of Ayala called for all lands stolen under Díaz to be immediately returned; there had been considerable land fraud under the old dictator, so a great deal of territory was involved. It also stated that large plantations owned by a single person or family should have one-third of their land nationalized, which would then be required to be given to poor farmers. It also argued that if any large plantation owner resisted this action, they should have the other two-thirds confiscated as well. The Plan of Ayala also invoked the name of President Benito Juárez, one of Mexico&#x27;s great liberal leaders, and compared the taking of land from the wealthy to Juarez&#x27;s actions when land was expropriated from the Catholic church during the Liberal Reform. Another part of the plan stated that rural cooperatives and other measurements should be put in place to prevent the land from being seized or stolen in the future.

In the following weeks, the development of military operations &quot;betray(ed) good evidence of clear and intelligent planning.&quot; During Orozco&#x27;s rebellion, Zapata fought Mexican troops in the south near Mexico City. In the original design of the armed force, Zapata was a mere colonel among several others; however, the true plan that came about through this organization lent itself to Zapata. Zapata believed that the best route of attack would be to center the fighting and action in Cuautla. If this political location could be overthrown, the army would have enough power to &quot;veto anyone else&#x27;s control of the state, negotiate for Cuernavaca or attack it directly, and maintain independent access to Mexico City as well as escape routes to the southern hills.&quot; However, in order to gain this great success, Zapata realized that his men needed to be better armed and trained.

The first line of action demanded that Zapata and his men &quot;control the area behind and below a line from Jojutla to Yecapixtla.&quot; When this was accomplished it gave the army the ability to complete raids as well as wait. As the opposition of the Federal Army and police detachments slowly dissipated, the army would be able to eventually gain powerful control over key locations on the Interoceanic Railway from Puebla City to Cuautla. If these feats could be completed, it would gain access to Cuautla directly and the city would fall.

The plan of action was carried out successfully in Jojutla. However, Pablo Torres Burgos, the commander of the operation, was disappointed that the army disobeyed his orders against looting and ransacking. The army took complete control of the area, and it seemed as though Torres Burgos had lost control over his forces prior to this event. Shortly after, Torres Burgos called a meeting and resigned from his position. Upon leaving Jojutla with his two sons, he was surprised by a federal police patrol who subsequently shot all three of the men on the spot. This seemed to some to be an ending blow to the movement, because Torres Burgos had not selected a successor for his position; however, Zapata was ready to take up where Torres Burgos had left off.

Shortly after Torres Burgos&#x27;s death, a party of rebels elected Zapata as &quot;Supreme Chief of the Revolutionary Movement of the South&quot;. This seemed to be the fix to all of the problems that had just arisen, but other individuals wanted to replace Zapata as well. Due to this new conflict, the individual who would come out on top would have to do so by &quot;convincing his peers he deserved their backing.&quot;

Zapata finally gained the support necessary by his peers and was considered a &quot;singularly qualified candidate&quot;. This decision to make Zapata the leader of the revolution in Morelos did not occur all at once, nor did it ever reach a true definitive level of recognition. In order to succeed, Zapata needed a strong financial backing for the battles to come. This came in the form of 10,000 pesos delivered by Rodolfo from the Tacubayans. Due to this amount of money Zapata&#x27;s group of rebels became one of the strongest in the state financially.

After a period Zapata became the leader of his &quot;strategic zone&quot;, which gave him power and control over the actions of many more individual rebel groups and thus greatly increased his margin of success. &quot;Among revolutionaries in other districts of the state, however, Zapata&#x27;s authority was more tenuous.&quot; After a meeting between Zapata and Ambrosio Figueroa in Jolalpan, it was decided that Zapata would have joint power with Figueroa with regard to operations in Morelos. This was a turning point in the level of authority and influence that Zapata had gained and proved useful in the direct overthrow of Morelos.

==== 1913–1914: opposition to Victoriano Huerta ====
If there was anyone that Zapata hated more than Díaz and Madero, it was Victoriano Huerta, the bitter, violent alcoholic who had been responsible for many atrocities in southern Mexico while trying to end the rebellion. Zapata was not alone: in the north, Pancho Villa, who had supported Madero, immediately took to the field against Huerta. Zapata revised the Plan of Ayala and named himself the leader of his revolution. He was joined by two newcomers to the Revolution, Venustiano Carranza and Alvaro Obregón, who raised large armies in Coahuila and Sonora respectively. Together they made short work of Huerta, who resigned and fled in June 1914 after repeated military losses.

==== 1914–1919: The conventionist government ====
On 21 April 1914, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent a contingent of troops to occupy the port city of Veracruz. This sudden threat caused Huerta to withdraw his troops from Morelos and Puebla, leaving only Jojutla and Cuernavaca under federal control. Zapatistas quickly assumed control of eastern Morelos, taking Cuautla and Jonacatepec with no resistance. In spite of being faced with a possible foreign invasion, Zapata refused to unite with Huerta in defense of the nation. He stated that if need be he would defend Mexico alone as chief of the Ayalan forces. In May the Zapatistas took Jojutla from the Federal Army, many of whom joined the rebels, and captured guns and ammunition. They also laid siege to Cuernavaca where a small contingent of federal troops were holed up. By the summer of 1915, Zapata&#x27;s forces had taken the southern edge of the Federal District, occupying Milpa Alta and Xochimilco, and were poised to move into the capital. In mid July, Huerta was forced to flee as a Constitutionalist force under Carranza, Obregón, and Villa took the Federal District. The Constitutionalists established a peace treaty, inserting Carranza as First Authority of the nation. Carranza, an aristocrat with politically relevant connections, then gained the backing of the US, which passed over Villa and Zapata due to their lower-status backgrounds and more progressive ideologies. In spite of having contributed decisively to the fall of Huerta, the Zapatistas were left out of the peace treaties, probably because of Carranza&#x27;s intense dislike for the Zapatistas, whom he saw as uncultured savages. Through 1915 there was a tentative peace in Morelos and the rest of the country.

As the Constitutionalist forces began to split, with Villa creating a popular front against Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalists, Carranza worked diplomatically to get the Zapatistas to recognize his rule, sending Dr. Atl as an envoy to propose a compromise with Zapata. For Carranza, an agreement with Zapata would mean that he did not need to worry about his force&#x27;s southern flank and could concentrate on defeating Villa. Zapata demanded veto power over Carranza&#x27;s decisions, which Carranza rejected, and negotiations broke off. Zapata issued a statement, perhaps drafted by his advisor, Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama.

The country wishes to destroy feudalism once and for all [while Carranza offers] administrative reform ... complete honesty in the handling of public monies ... freedom of the press for those who cannot read; free elections for those who do not know the candidates; proper legal proceedings for those who have never had anything to do with an attorney. All those beautiful democratic principles, all those great words that give such joy to our fathers and grandfathers have lost their magic ... The people continue to suffer from poverty and endless disappointments.

Unable to reach an agreement, the Constitutionalists divided along ideological lines, with Zapata and Villa leading a progressive rebellion, and Carranza and Obregón leading the conservative faction of the remaining Constitutionalists. Villa and the other anti-Carrancista leaders of the North established the Convention of Aguascalientes against Carranza. Zapata and his envoys got the convention to adopt some of the agrarian principles of the Plan de Ayala. Zapata and Villa met in Xochimilco to negotiate an alliance and divide the responsibility for ridding Mexico of the remaining Carrancistas. The meeting was awkward but amiable, and was widely publicized. It was decided that Zapata should work on securing the area east of Morelos from Puebla towards Veracruz. Nonetheless, during the ensuing campaign in Puebla, Zapata was disappointed by Villa&#x27;s lack of support. Villa did not initially provide the Zapatistas with the weaponry they had agreed on and, when he did, he did not provide adequate transportation. There were also a series of abuses by Villistas against Zapatista soldiers and chiefs. These experiences led Zapata to grow unsatisfied with the alliance, turning instead his efforts to reorganizing the state of Morelos that had been left in shambles by the onslaught of Huerta and Robles. Having taken Puebla, Zapata left a couple of garrisons there but did not support Villa further against Obregón and Carranza. The Carrancistas saw that the rebel alliance was divided and decided to concentrate on beating Villa, which left the Zapatistas to their own devices for a while.

Through 1915, Zapata began reshaping Morelos after the Plan de Ayala, redistributing &quot;hacienda&quot; lands to the peasants, and largely letting village councils run their own local affairs. Most peasants did not turn to cash crops, instead growing subsistence crops such as corn, beans, and vegetables. The result was that as the capital was starving, while the peasants had more to eat than they had had in 1910 and at lower prices. The only official event in Morelos during this entire year was a bullfight in which Zapata himself and his nephew Amador Salazar participated. 1915 was a short period of peace and prosperity for the farmers of Morelos, in between the massacres of the Huerta era and the civil war of the winners to come.

Even when Villa was retreating, having lost the Battle of Celaya in 1915, and Obregón took the capital from the Conventionists, who retreated to Toluca, Zapata did not open a second front.

When Carranza&#x27;s forces were poised to move into Morelos, Zapata took action. He attacked Carrancista positions with large forces, trying to harry the Carrancistas in the rear as they were occupied with routing Villa throughout the Northwest. Though Zapata managed to take many important sites such as the Necaxa power plant that supplied Mexico City, he was unable to hold them. The Convention was finally routed from Toluca, and Carranza was recognized by US President Woodrow Wilson as the head of state of Mexico in October.

Through 1916, Zapata attacked federal forces from Hidalgo to Oaxaca, and Genovevo de la O fought the Carrancistas in Guerrero. The Zapatistas attempted to amass support for their cause by promulgating new manifestos against the &quot;hacendados&quot;, but this had little effect since the &quot;hacendados&quot; had already lost power throughout the country.

Having been put in charge of the efforts to root out Zapatismo in Morelos, Pablo González Garza was humiliated by Zapata&#x27;s counterattacks and enforced increasingly draconian measures against the locals. He received no reinforcements, as Obregón, the Minister of War, needed all his forces against Villa in the north and against Felix Díaz in Oaxaca. Through low-scale attacks on Gonzalez&#x27;s positions, Zapata drove Gonzalez out of Morelos by the end of 1916.

Nonetheless, outside of Morelos, the revolutionary forces started disbanding. Some rebels (such as Domingo Arenas) joined the constitutionalists,while others lapsed into banditry. In Morelos, Zapata once more reorganized the Zapatista state, continuing with democratic reforms and legislation meant to keep the civil population safe from abuses by soldiers. Though his advisers urged him to mount a concerted campaign against the Carrancistas across southern Mexico, again he concentrated entirely on stabilizing Morelos and making life tolerable for the peasants. Meanwhile, Carranza mounted national elections in all state capitals except Cuernavaca, and promulgated the 1917 Constitution which incorporated elements of the Plan de Ayala.

Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. When Arenas went over to the constitutionalists, he secured peace for his region and remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A faction within the Zapatista ranks, led by former General Vazquez and Zapata&#x27;s erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montaño, moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters, demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montaño tried for treason and executed.

Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Díaz. He sent Gildardo Magaña as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata&#x27;s brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos, taking Cuautla, Zacualpan, and Jonacatepec.

Zapata continued to try to unite the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918, severe cold weather and the onset of the Spanish flu caused the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that with the end of World War I, the US would turn its attention to Mexico, forcing the Zapatistas either to join the Carrancistas in a national defense or acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico.

In December 1918, Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign, taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters was moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also remained under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did.

Zapata released statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to Germany. In March, Zapata finally sent an open letter to Carranza, urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gómez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement. Having issued this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, Zapata was urged by Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magaña, and Ayaquica not to take any risks and lie low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front.

== Personal life ==
=== Children ===
As far as is known, Zapata fathered a total of 16 documented children with 9 women, but it has also been commented that there were actually 14 women with whom he had relationships.
* With Inés Alfaro Aguilar he procreated his first five documented children: Guadalupe, Nicolás, Juan, Ponciano and María Elena.
* When the Porfirian dictatorship fell, on 20 August 1911, he married Miss Josefa Espejo Merino known as &quot;La Generala&quot; (San Miguel de Anenecuilco, Wednesday 19 March 1879 – Villa de Ayala, Friday, 8 August 1968), daughter of Don Fidencio Espejo and Guadalupe Sánchez Merino, with whom he had two children. The first, a boy named Felipe Zapata Espejo, was born around 1912 on El Jilguero hill and died at the age of five, around 1917, in one of the many shelters that the family had, after being bitten by a rattlesnake. The second child was a girl, Josefa Zapata Espejo, born around 1913 in Tlaltizapán and who died a year before Felipe, around 1916, as a result of a scorpion sting.
* With Margarita Sáenz Ugalde (23 July 1899, in Yautepec, Morelos – 17 March 1974, in Mexico City), he had three children: Luis Eugenio (2 December 1914, in Tlapehuala, Guerrero – 10 October 1979, in Mexico City), Margarita and Gabriel Zapata Sáenz, the latter two of whom died shortly after birth.
* With Petra Portillo Torres, he had a daughter, Ana María Zapata Portillo, born on 22 June 1915, in Cuautla. She was aware of her father&#x27;s legacy from a very early age, and this made her continue his work of dedication to agrarian rights, serving as treasurer of the &quot;ejido&quot; of Cuautla, as &quot;ejidataria&quot; of Cuautla, as municipal councilor and municipal trustee. She died on 28 February 2010, in Cuautla, and was buried in the Municipal Pantheon of Cuautla.
* With María de Jesús Pérez Caballero, native of Coahuixtla, he had Mateo Emiliano Zapata Pérez, who was born on 21 September 1917, in Temilpa Viejo, Tlaltizapán, Morelos, and died on 10 January 2007, in Cuautla. He was buried in the Cuautla Municipal Pantheon.
* With Georgina Piñeiro, he had Diego Zapata Piñeiro, who was born in Tlaltizapán on 13 December 1916, and died on 20 December 2008, in Mexico City. He was buried in the Cuautla Municipal Pantheon.
* With Gregoria Zúñiga Benítez, he had María Luisa Zapata Zúñiga, born in Quilamula, Morelos, on 21 June 1916, and died in 1935 of meningitis, leaving no descendants.
* He did not leave descendants with Luz Zúñiga Benítez, although according to historian Carlos Barreto Mark, there is a version that she had a child, who apparently died at birth.
* With Agapita Sánchez, he had Carlota Zapata Sánchez, born in Huitzilac, Morelos, in 1913 and died in Jiutepec, Morelos, on 22 April 2014, aged 100.
* With Matilde Vázquez, he had Gabriel Zapata Vázquez.

There is a version of the existence of another son, José Zapata, of an unknown mother, but the validity of the latter is not fully proven.

=== Sexuality ===
According to the book &quot;The Album of Amada Díaz&quot; written by Ricardo Orozco and based on the diaries of Amada Díaz, daughter of Porfirio Díaz, Zapata had a very good friendship with Ignacio de la Torre y Mier, Amada&#x27;s husband. The friendship between the two has been questioned over time, and it has been said that Zapata and Mier had an affair. As stated in the aforementioned work, it is said that both met in 1906, when the revolutionary worked in the stables of the Hacienda de San Carlos Borromeo. It was not openly known, but Mier was homosexual, so when he met Zapata he fell in love with him and decided to take him to work at his ranch located in Mexico City. Once there, the book cites that in words written by Amada Díaz, she saw them &quot;wallowing in the stables&quot;.

Some time after this, as De la Torre y Mier was a politician and businessman, the Mexican Revolution represented a problem for him, this being one of the reasons why he would finance a fight that would try to eradicate the movement. The efforts were useless, since in the end the Revolution managed to triumph. Subsequently, Venustiano Carranza, one of its leaders, ordered Mier&#x27;s imprisonment. Taking the alleged relationship he had with Zapata as a background, it has been said that it could have been a kind of &quot;gay love gesture&quot; that Zapata had with him, because thanks to the intervention of the aforementioned, he managed to be given freedom and escape from imprisonment. With this history, it has been concluded that he may have been a bisexual man.

Other people who have talked about this include Pedro Ángel Palou, as in his novel &quot;Zapata&quot; insinuates that Zapata had some homosexual relations. The latter was based on testimonies told by Manuel &quot;El Ave Negra&quot; Palafox, who was the trusted emissary, personal secretary, and one of the closest revolutionaries to Zapata, who additionally was secretly gay. Zapata was aware of his preferences and had no problems with it, but since he was governed by the principle of executing those who were too &quot;feminine&quot;, and Palafox behaved in this way, little by little the rumor about the homosexuality of his revolutionary companion was gaining strength among his troops, and finally in 1918, he found it necessary to remove him from his post as general and main Zapatista emissary.

==Assassination==
Eliminating Zapata was a top priority for President Carranza. Carranza was unwilling to compromise with domestic foes and wanted to demonstrate to Mexican elites and to American interests that Carranza was the &quot;only viable alternative to both anarchy and radicalism.&quot; In mid-March 1919, General Pablo González ordered his subordinate Jesús Guajardo to begin operations against the Zapatistas in the mountains around Huautla. But when González later discovered Guajardo carousing in a &quot;cantina&quot;, he had him arrested, and a public scandal ensued.

On 21 March, Zapata attempted to smuggle in a note to Guajardo, inviting him to switch sides. The note, however, never reached Guajardo but instead wound up on González&#x27;s desk. González devised a plan to use this note to his advantage. He accused Guajardo of not only being a drunk, but of being a traitor. After reducing Guajardo to tears, González explained to him that he could recover from this disgrace if he feigned a defection to Zapata. So Guajardo wrote to Zapata telling him that he would bring over his men and supplies if certain guarantees were promised. Zapata answered Guajardo&#x27;s letter on 1 April 1919, agreeing to all of Guajardo&#x27;s terms.

Zapata suggested a mutiny on 4 April. Guajardo replied that his defection should wait until a new shipment of arms and ammunition arrived sometime between the 6th and the 10th. By the 7th, the plans were set: Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata. Pablo González and Guajardo notified the Jonacatepec garrison ahead of time, and a mock battle was staged on 9 April. At the conclusion of the mock battle, the former Zapatistas were arrested and shot. Convinced that Guajardo was sincere, Zapata agreed to a final meeting where Guajardo would defect.

On 10 April 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries. However, when Zapata arrived at the Hacienda de San Juan, in Chinameca, Ayala municipality, Guajardo&#x27;s men riddled him with bullets.

Zapata&#x27;s body was photographed, displayed for 24 hours, and then buried in Cuautla. Pablo González wanted the body photographed, so that there would be no doubt that Zapata was dead: &quot;it was an actual fact that the famous &quot;jefe&quot; of the southern region had died.&quot; Although Mexico City newspapers had called for Zapata&#x27;s body to be brought to the capital, Carranza did not do so. However, Zapata&#x27;s clothing was displayed outside a newspaper&#x27;s office across from the Alameda Park in the capital.

===Immediate aftermath===
Although Zapata&#x27;s assassination weakened his forces in Morelos, the Zapatistas continued the fight against Carranza. For Carranza the death of Zapata was the removal of an ongoing threat, for many Zapata&#x27;s assassination undermined &quot;worker and peasant support for Carranza and Pablo González.&quot; Obregón seized on the opportunity to attack Carranza and González, Obregón&#x27;s rival candidate for the presidency, by saying &quot;this crime reveals a lack of ethics in some members of the government and also of political sense, since peasant votes in the upcoming election will now go to whoever runs against Pablo González.&quot;

In spite of González&#x27;s attempts to sully the name of Zapata and the Plan de Ayala during his 1920 campaign for the presidency, the people of Morelos continued to support Zapatista generals, providing them with weapons, supplies and protection. Carranza was wary of the threat of U.S. intervention, and Zapatista generals decided to take a conciliatory approach. Bands of Zapatistas started surrendering in exchange for amnesties, and many Zapatista generals went on to become local authorities, such as Fortino Ayaquica who became municipal president of Tochimilco. Other generals such as Genovevo de la O remained active in small-scale guerrilla warfare.

As Venustiano Carranza moved to curb his former allies and now rivals in 1920 to impose a civilian, Ignacio Bonillas, as his successor in the presidency, Obregón sought to align himself with the Zapatista movement against that of Carranza. Genovevo de la O and Magaña supported him in the coup by former Constitutionalists, fighting in Morelos against Carranza and helping prompt Carranza to flee Mexico City toward Veracruz in May 1920. &quot;Obregón and Genovevo de la O entered Mexico City in triumph.&quot;

Zapatistas were given important posts in the interim government of Adolfo de la Huerta and the administration of Álvaro Obregón, following his election to the presidency after the coup. Zapatistas had almost total control of the state of Morelos, where they carried out a program of agrarian reform and land redistribution based on the provisions of the Plan de Ayala and with the support of the government.

According to &quot;La Demócrata&quot;, after Zapata&#x27;s assassination, &quot;in the consciousness of the natives&quot;, Zapata &quot;had taken on the proportions of a myth&quot; because he had &quot;given them a formula of vindication against old offenses.&quot; Mythmaking would continue for decades after Zapata was gunned down.

==Legacy==

Zapata&#x27;s influence continues to this day, particularly in revolutionary tendencies in southern Mexico. In the long run, he has done more for his ideals in death than he did in life. He came to be viewed as a martyr to the cause of land reform after his murder. Even though Mexico still has not implemented the sort of land reform he wanted, he is remembered as a visionary who fought for his countrymen.

Zapata&#x27;s Plan of Ayala influenced Article 27 of the progressive 1917 Constitution of Mexico that codified an agrarian reform program. Even though the Mexican Revolution did restore some land that had been taken under Díaz, the land reform on the scale imagined by Zapata was never enacted. However, a great deal of the significant land distribution which Zapata sought would later be enacted after Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas took office in 1934. Cárdenas would fulfill not only the land distribution policies written in Article 27, but other reforms written in the Mexican Constitution as well.

There are controversies about the portrayal of Emiliano Zapata and his followers, whether they were bandits or revolutionaries. At the outbreak of the Revolution, &quot;Zapata&#x27;s agrarian revolt was soon construed as a &#x27;caste war&#x27; [race war], in which members of an &#x27;inferior race&#x27; were captained by a &#x27;modern Attila.

Zapata is now one of the most revered national heroes of Mexico. To many Mexicans, especially the peasant and indigenous citizens, Zapata was a practical revolutionary who sought the implementation of liberties and agrarian rights outlined in the Plan of Ayala. He was a realist with the goal of achieving political and economic emancipation of the peasants in southern Mexico and leading them out of severe poverty.

Many popular organizations take their name from Zapata, most notably the Zapatista Army of National Liberation &quot;(Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional&quot; or EZLN in Spanish), the Neozapatismo group that emerged in the state of Chiapas in 1983 and precipitated the 1994 indigenous Zapatista uprising which still continues in Chiapas. Towns, streets, and housing developments called &quot;Emiliano Zapata&quot; are common across the country and he has, at times, been depicted on Mexican banknotes.

According to Eric Wolf, Zapata and his movement have also been credited with contributing towards Christian socialism and liberation theology. Zapata and his agrarian revolutionaries fought under the emblem of Virgin of Guadalupe, which highlighted the Catholic nature of the movement. Unlike the &quot;Constitutionalists&quot; and &quot;Obregonistas&quot;, Zapata&#x27;s revolutionary faction was considered friendly towards the Catholic Church. As the followers of Zapata were committed Catholics and were known for tucking pictures of Virgin Mary into their hats for protection, many Cristeros strongly admired Zapata during the Cristero War.

Damariz Posadas named Zapatismo &quot;an example of a Marian movement being shaped by liberation theology&quot;, noting the connection between the Zapatist Marian message that &quot;the natives as the chosen people&quot; and the central concept of liberation theology, the &quot;preferential option for the poor&quot;. Zapata recognized the indigenous as the poor of México and promoted a culture of a revolution against poverty. The Neo-Zapatistas that followed the legacy of Zapata kept the Marian roots of his movement, and the Catholic Church became politically involved with the Neo-Zapatistas in the 1960s, further shaping their ideology. One Zapatista fighter remarked: &quot;We all wanted change, we prayed, it
helped but it did not solve anything. The church helps us fight. Yes, we use weapons. but not always. Right now, we focus on changing the government and changing the laws to help people.&quot;

Zapata left a profound influence on Mexican natives, and his movement became a defining feature of the morelense culture. His agrarian struggle has a primary role in the collective memory of Morelos and local religious festivals incorporate him &quot;on an almost equal level with saint&quot;. Zapata&#x27;s ventures were attributed to the intervention from patron saints, and Zapatista veterans became the secular complement of local cult of saints, as they became “both symbols of the ideals, the wishes, of the group.” In other regions such as Chiapas and Tepoztlán, Zapata is also worshipped as a reincarnated Mayan deity - Votán Zapata.

Modern activists in Mexico frequently make reference to Zapata in their campaigns; his image is commonly seen on banners, and many chants invoke his name: (&quot;If Zapata lived, he would walk with us&quot;), and (&quot;Zapata lives; the struggle continues&quot;).

The tomb of Zapata is located in Cuautla, Morelos, and every year several festivities are held around the anniversary of his death.

The fossil reptile &quot;Zapatadon&quot; (Rhynchocephalia) was named after him.

==In popular culture==
Zapata has been depicted in movies, comics, books, music, and clothing. For example, there was the stage musical &quot;Zapata&quot; (1980), written by Harry Nilsson and Perry Botkin, with a libretto by Allan Katz, which ran for 16 weeks at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. A movie called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Zapata: A Hero&#x27;s Dream&quot;) was produced in 2004, starring Mexican actors Alejandro Fernandez, Jaime Camil, and Lucero. There is also a sub-genre of the Spaghetti Western called the &quot;Zapata Western&quot;, which features stories set during the Mexican Revolution.

Marlon Brando played Emiliano Zapata in the award-winning movie based on his life, &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; in 1952. The film co-starred Anthony Quinn, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the role of Zapata&#x27;s brother. The director was Elia Kazan and the writer was John Steinbeck.

Emiliano Zapata is a major character in &quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; (1996), by &quot;James Carlos Blake&quot;

Emiliano Zapata is referenced in the musical Ragtime in the number &quot;Epilogue: Ragtime/ Wheels of a Dream (reprise)&quot;, mentioning that one of the characters goes Mexico to join Zapata&#x27;s revolution at the end of the musical.

Emiliano Zapata is referenced in the songs &quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot; by American rock band Rage Against the Machine from their album &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles.&quot; and &quot;Zapata&#x27;s Blood&quot; from their album &quot;The Battle of Mexico City&quot;. Zapata is also referenced in the song &quot;Veracruz&quot; by Warren Zevon which is about the Mexican revolution and the invasion of Veracruz.

In the 2011 Mexican TV series &quot;El Encanto del Aguila&quot; Zapata is played by the Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta.

In December 2019, an arts show commemorating the 100 year anniversary of his death was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The show featured 141 works. A painting called &quot;La Revolución&quot; depicted Zapata as intentionally effeminate, riding an erect horse, nude except for high heels and a pink hat. According to the artist, he created the painting to combat machismo. The painting caused protests from the farmer&#x27;s union and admirers of Zapata. His grandson Jorge Zapata González threatened to sue if the painting was not removed. There was a clash between supporters of the painting and detractors at the museum. A compromise was reached with some of Zapata&#x27;s family, a label was placed next to the painting outlining their disagreement with the painting.
