<text>Yonkers () is the third-most populous city in the U.S. state of New York and the most-populous city in Westchester County. A centrally located municipality within the New York metropolitan area, Yonkers had a population of 211,569 at the 2020 United States census. Yonkers is classified as an inner suburb of New York City, immediately north of the Bronx and approximately north of Marble Hill (the northernmost point in Manhattan).

Downtown Yonkers is centered around Getty Square, where the municipal government is located. The downtown area, which also houses local businesses and nonprofit organizations, is a retail hub for the city and the northwest Bronx. Major shopping areas are in Getty Square on South Broadway, at the Cross County Shopping Center and the Ridge Hill Mall, and along Central Park Avenue.

The city has a number of attractions, including Tibbetts Brook Park, Untermyer Park and Gardens, the Hudson River Museum, the Saw Mill River, the Science Barge, Sherwood House, and access to the Hudson River. Yonkers is also known as the City of Seven Hills: Park, Nodine, Ridge, Cross, Locust, Glen, and Church Hills. The city has continued to experience significant gentrification since the inception of the 21st century.
== Name ==
The area was granted to Adriaen van der Donck, the patroon of Colen Donck, in July 1645. Van der Donck was known locally as , an honorific title derived from the Dutch and . The title, similar to &quot;esquire&quot;, is linguistically comparable to the German . was shortened to (possessive ), from which the name &quot;Yonkers&quot; derives. The city&#x27;s residents are known as Yonkersonians, Yonkersites, Yonkers, or Yonks.

== History ==
=== Early settlements ===

The indigenous Native American village of Nappeckamack was located near the Neperah stream (now the Saw Mill River, also known as Nepperhan Creek), which flowed into the Shatemuck (Hudson River). The land on which the city is built was once part of Colen Donck, a Dutch land grant. It ran north from the present-day Manhattan–Bronx border at Marble Hill, and from the Hudson River east to the Bronx River.

Adriaen van der Donck (d. 1655) built a saw mill near the confluence of Nepperhan Creek and the Hudson River. Near the site of Van der Donck&#x27;s mill is the Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site, a manor house owned by Dutch colonists. The historic house museum is also an archive. The original structure was built by white workers and enslaved people for Frederick Philipse and his wife, Margaret Hardenbroeck de Vries, around 1682. Philipse was a wealthy Dutchman who, at his death, had amassed an estate which included present-day Yonkers and several other Hudson River towns. Philipse&#x27;s great-grandson, Frederick Philipse III, was a prominent loyalist during the American Revolution who had economic and political ties to English businesspeople. Because of his political leanings, he fled to England. American colonists in New York State confiscated and sold all lands and property belonging to the Philipse family.

=== Gentrification and redlining ===
Yonkers has undergone several changes to neighborhoods in an effort to revitalize the city, which has included gentrification. Changes were made to its waterfront, which included revitalizing its green space.

Residents of the western area of downtown Yonkers opposed the Pierpointe, a condominium-complex development proposal that would build over 1,900 condominiums (including six 38-story towers), during the 1980s struggle against segregation. According to critics, the development would bring homelessness and gentrification to the area.

Downtown gentrification has raised concerns that poorer residents might be forced out of the city. A Yonkers Arts Gallery painting, &quot;But It&#x27;s Ours: The Redline Between Poverty and Wealth&quot; by Shanequa Benitez, illustrates the effects of gentrification on Yonkers.

In an effort to combat redlining, the city announced the Yonkers Greenway: a $14 million rail trail along former railways such as the New York and Putnam Railroad. The greenway will run from Van Cortlandt Park to Getty Square. Construction, expected to begin in spring 2024, is planned to be completed in 2026.

===Incorporation and growth===

The Village of Yonkers was incorporated in the western Town of Yonkers in 1854, and incorporated as a city in 1872. In 1873, the southern Town of Yonkers (outside the City of Yonkers) became the Town of Kingsbridge; this included Woodlawn Cemetery and the present-day neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, Riverdale, and Woodlawn Heights. The Town of Kingsbridge was annexed by New York City the following year as part of the Bronx. In 1898, Yonkers, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island voted on a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City. Although the referendum passed elsewhere, Yonkers and neighboring Mount Vernon were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent. Some residents call Yonkers &quot;the sixth borough&quot; because of its location on the New York City border, its urban character, and the merger referendum.

A 1942 subway connection was planned between Getty Square and the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which terminates in Riverdale at 242nd Street (slightly south of the city line). The plan was dropped.

In 1937, a water tower collapsed in the Nodine Hills area; nine people were initially injured. The injury total increased by three after the collapse, bringing the number to 12. About of water from the tower spilled, causing flooding in the area that crushed cars and damaged homes. Construction of a new tower began in 1938, and it became operational the following year.

===Wartime===
During the American Civil War, 254 Yonkers residents joined the U.S. Army and Navy. They enlisted primarily in four regiments: the 6th New York Heavy Artillery, the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry, the 17th New York Volunteers, and the 15th NY National Guard. During the New York City draft riots, Yonkers formed the Home Guards. The guards were a force of constables formed to protect Yonkers from rioting which was feared to spread from New York City (it did not). Seventeen Yonkers residents were killed during the Civil War.

During World War I, 6,909 Yonkers residents (about seven percent of the city&#x27;s population) entered military service. Most Yonkers men joined the 27th Division or the 77th Division. One hundred thirty-seven city residents were killed during the war. In the 1918 sinking of the USS &quot;President Lincoln&quot;, seventeen sailors from Yonkers survived. Civilians helped the war effort by joining organizations such as the American Red Cross. The Yonkers chapter of the Red Cross had 126 members in 1916; by the end of the war, 15,358 Yonkers residents belonged to the chapter. Mostly women, they prepared surgical dressings, created hospital garments for the wounded, and knit articles of clothing for refugees and soldiers. In addition to joining the Red Cross, Yonkers residents donated $19,255,255 to a number of war drives.

The city&#x27;s factories were converted to produce items for World War II, such as tents and blankets from the Alexander Smith and Sons carpet factory and tanks from the Otis Elevator factory. Increased competition from less-expensive imports resulted in a decline in manufacturing in Yonkers after the war, and a number of industrial jobs were lost.

=== Industry ===
Yonkers was originally a small farming town which produced peaches, apples, potatoes, oats, wheat, and other agricultural goods to be shipped to New York City along the Hudson River. Water power created manufacturing jobs. Elisha Otis invented a safety elevator in 1853, and the Otis Elevator Company opened the world&#x27;s first elevator factory on the Hudson near present-day Vark Street. The company moved to larger quarters during the 1880s, which later became the Yonkers Public Library. The Woman&#x27;s Institute of Yonkers, established in 1880 as the Free Circulating Library for Self-Supporting Women, is the city&#x27; s oldest social service agency.

Around that time, the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company in the Saw Mill River Valley expanded to 45 buildings, 800 looms, and more than 4,000 workers. It was known as one of the world&#x27;s premier carpet-producing centers.

In addition to manufacturing, Yonkers played a key role in the development of recreational sports in the United States. Scottish-born John Reid founded Saint Andrew&#x27;s Golf Club in the city in 1888; it was the first golf course in the United States. That year, the New York City and Northern Railway Company (later the New York Central Railroad) connected Yonkers to Manhattan and points north. A three-mile spur to Getty Square operated until 1943. Bakelite, the first completely-synthetic plastic, was invented in Yonkers by Leo Baekeland and was manufactured there until the late 1920s.

During the early 20th century, Yonkers hosted the Brass-Era automaker Colt Runabout. Although the vehicle reportedly ran well, the company went out of business. Yonkers was the headquarters of hat manufacturer Waring Hat Company, which was the largest in the nation when it opened. On January 4, 1940, Yonkers resident Edwin Howard Armstrong transmitted the first FM radio broadcast on the W2XCR station from the Yonkers home of co-experimenter C. R. Runyon. Yonkers had the longest-running pirate radio station, which was owned by Allan Weiner and operated during the 1970s and 1980s.

The Alexander Smith Carpet Company, one of the city&#x27;s largest employers, ceased operations during a June 1954 labor dispute. In 1983, the Otis Elevator factory closed. A Kawasaki railcar-assembly plant opened in 1986 in the former Otis plant. With the loss of manufacturing jobs, Yonkers became a commuter town. Some neighborhoods, such as Crestwood and Park Hill, became popular with wealthy New Yorkers who wanted to live outside Manhattan without giving up urban conveniences. Yonkers&#x27; transportation infrastructure, which included three commuter railroad lines and five parkways and thruways, made it a desirable city in which to live. A 15-minute drive from Manhattan, it has a number of prewar homes and apartment buildings. Yonkers&#x27; manufacturing sector has also revived during the early 21st century. In 2024, Kawasaki rail reached a milestone with its 5,000th railway car.

=== Racial discrimination and &quot;United States v. Yonkers&quot; ===
In 1960, the population of Yonkers was 95.8 percent white and four percent Black. The city developed a national reputation for racial tension during the 1980s and 1990s, based on a long-term battle between the city and the NAACP over the construction of subsidized, low-income housing projects. Yonkers planned to use federal funding for urban renewal exclusively downtown; other groups, led by the NAACP, believed that the resulting concentration of low-income housing in traditionally-poor neighborhoods would perpetuate poverty. Although the city had been warned in 1971 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development about further construction of low-income housing in west Yonkers, it continued to support subsidized housing in this area between 1972 and 1977.

In 1980, the NAACP and the federal government filed suit against the city of Yonkers and its board of education in &quot;United States v. Yonkers&quot;. After a 1985 decision and an unsuccessful appeal, Yonkers&#x27; schools were integrated three years later. According to a ruling by federal judge Leonard B. Sand, Yonkers engaged in institutional segregation in housing and educational policies for more than 40 years. He connected the city&#x27;s opposition to ending racial segregation from its public schools to the unlawful concentration of public housing and discrimination in private housing.

Yonkers gained national and international attention during the summer of 1988, when it backed out of its previous agreement to build municipal public housing in the eastern parts of the city (an agreement it had made in a consent decree after losing its appeal in 1987). After its reversal, the city was found in contempt of the federal courts. Sand imposed a fine on Yonkers which began at $100 and doubled every day, capped at $1 million per day by an appeals court, until the city capitulated to the federally-mandated plan. The city remained in contempt of court until September 9, 1988, when its city council relented as the financial impact threatened to close a library and reduce sanitation. The city also considered massive layoffs, which would have adversely affected its ability to provide services to the upper classes it was trying to retain. Nicholas C. Wasicsko, Yonkers&#x27; youngest mayor (elected at age 28), struggled in city politics. He helped end the city&#x27;s contempt-of-court ruling, but was voted out of office as a result. Wasicsko&#x27;s story, subject of the 2015 miniseries &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot;, was adapted from a 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by Lisa Belkin. The 2007 documentary &quot;Brick by Brick: A Civil Rights Story&quot; also covers racial discrimination and housing segregation in Yonkers.

As a result of the federal lawsuit, Yonkers&#x27; public-school enrollment dropped from 54 percent of the city&#x27;s eligible population to under 30 percent as thousands of white families left the city for its suburbs or enrolled their children in private schools; this effectively gutted the city&#x27;s middle class and tax base. The school district&#x27;s estimated cost of integration was over $262 million. Forced to cut programs, Yonkers schools fell steeply in national rankings as test scores sharply declined. By 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the city&#x27;s desegregation effort &quot;a profound disappointment to blacks and whites alike&quot;. Michael Sussmann, the NAACP&#x27;s lawyer during the case, blamed Sand for failing to allocate federal funds to help relieve the cost of integration.

=== 21st century ===

Areas of Yonkers which bordered similar neighborhoods in Riverdale began seeing an influx of Orthodox Jews during the 2000s, and the Riverdale Hatzalah volunteer ambulance service began serving neighborhoods in the southwest part of the city. The Sherwood Park Cemetery is a small Jewish cemetery.

Two former Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company loft buildings (at 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue) have been repurposed to house the YoHo Artist Community, which has private studios there. Yonkers Raceway, a harness racing track, renovated its grounds and clubhouse and added video slot machines in 2006 to become Yonkers Raceway &amp; Empire City Casino. MGM Resorts International bought the raceway and casino in 2018 for $850 million.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city opened several test sites at the ParkCare Pavilion of St. John&#x27;s Riverside Hospital (considered a COVID-19 hotspot). The test site was operated by the New York State Department of Health during the pandemic. More test sites opened in the city as students prepared to return to school for in-person instruction.

In February 2023, the Yonkers City Council approved the US Post Office on Main Street for local-landmark status after its 1989 listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. On September 29, 2023, a state of emergency was declared in the city after flash flooding affected most of the Hudson Valley and New York City. Most area parkways were closed and flooding was also reported in neighboring Mount Vernon. After the flooding, crews pumped water out of Yonkers homes.

The city has been used as a location for films and television series, and the City Hall courtroom is used for film scenes and commercials. The city along with neighboring Mount Vernon saw an increase in revenue grow from 2016. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002) and &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003) were partially filmed in the city. Yonkers is the setting of two feature films by local filmmaker Robert Celestino: &quot;Mr. Vincent&quot; (1997) and &quot;Yonkers Joe&quot; (2008). The city is the setting for the 2005 film &quot;A Tale of Two Pizzas&quot;, and Tyler, the Creator released &quot;Yonkers&quot; in 2011. Neil Simon&#x27;s play, &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;, and its film version are set in the city. A new Lionsgate Studios facility hosts the Spanish multimedia communications group Mediapro, and a planned $500 million expansion would make it the largest such facility in the Northeast.

== Geography ==
Yonkers covers an area of , including of land and of water. On the east, the Bronx River separates Yonkers from Mount Vernon, Tuckahoe, Eastchester, Bronxville, and Scarsdale. The town of Greenburgh is on the north, and the Hudson River forms the western border. Yonkers borders the Riverdale, Woodlawn, and Wakefield sections of The Bronx from the south. The city is spread over hills rising from near sea level on the east bank of the Hudson River to above sea level at Sacred Heart Church, whose spire can be seen from Long Island, New York City, and New Jersey.

Yonkers is considered a City of Seven Hills: Park, Nodine, Ridge, Cross, Locust, Glen, and Church Hills. Much of the city developed around the Saw Mill River, which enters Yonkers from the north and flows into the Hudson River at Getty Square. Portions of the river had been buried in flumes under parking lots, but have been uncovered (daylighted). Daylighting promotes the restoration of habitat for plants, fish, and other fauna, and helps develop an understanding of where Native Americans camped in spring and summer.

== Demographics ==
Yonkers is the third-most populous city in New York State. In the 2018 American Community Survey, 34.8 percent of Yonkers residents spoke Spanish and 4.2 percent of the population was West Indian. Yonkers has a sizeable Arab population, mainly from the Levant (especially Jordanians and Palestinians). There is also a sizeable Albanian population in the city.

In the 2010 census, there were 195,976 people in Yonkers and its population density was . There were 80,839 housing units, with an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 55.8 percent white, 18.7 percent African American, 0.7 percent Native American, 5.9 percent Asian, 0.1 percent Pacific Islander, 14.7 percent from other races, and 4.1 percent from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any racial background were 34.7 percent of the population. Non-Hispanic whites were 41.4 percent of the population in 2010, down from 89.9 percent in 1970.

Data from the 2020 census indicated that Yonkers&#x27; population grew by eight percent from 2010 to 2020, an increase from 195,976 to 211,569. Yonkers surpassed Rochester as the third-most populous city in New York, behind New York City and Buffalo. The Hispanic population increased, as the non-Hispanic population decreased to 33 percent from 41.4 percent in 2010. The Hispanic and Latino population increased to 40 percent, and the Asian population increased to 5.9%. The city reported a decrease in its white population from 55.8 to 46.3 percent.

===2020 census===
==Neighborhoods==
Yonkers includes several small residential enclaves and communities which form four quarters, demarcated by the Saw Mill River. There are at least 38 neighborhoods, but many of their original names are rarely used except by older residents and real-estate brokers.

===Northeast Yonkers===


Northeast Yonkers is a primarily Irish-American and Italian-American area. House sizes vary, from small houses set close together to larger homes in neighborhoods such as Lawrence Park West and mid-rise apartment buildings along Central Avenue (NY 100). Central Avenue (officially Central Park Avenue) is a shopping area. Notable former residents include Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, whose childhood home was at 100 Pembrook Drive.

The area contains the affluent neighborhoods of Crestwood, Colonial Heights, and Cedar Knolls, and the wealthy enclaves of Beech Hill and Lawrence Park West. It includes a gated community off the eastern Grassy Sprain Reservoir, known as Winchester Villages. Notable places include St. Vladimir&#x27;s Seminary, Sarah Lawrence College, and the Tanglewood Shopping Center, former home of the Tanglewood Boys gang. The area is also home to the Ridge Hill Mall shopping center, which contains a Legoland Discovery Center Westchester, the first Legoland Discovery Center to open in the Northeast area of the United States. Northeast Yonkers is somewhat more expensive than the rest of the city and, due to the proximity of several Metro-North commuter railroad stations, its residents generally work for Manhattan corporations.

===Northwest Yonkers===
Northwest Yonkers neighborhoods vary, spanning from the Hudson River to the New York State Thruway (I-87) and from Ashburton Avenue north to the Hastings-on-Hudson border. With the Hudson River bordering it on the west, northwest Yonkers has many Victorian-era homes with panoramic views of the Palisades. The Victorian architecture and number of 19th-century estates in northwest Yonkers has attracted filmmakers.

An interest in historic preservation has developed, demonstrated on streets such as Shonnard Terrace, Delavan Terrace, and Hudson Terrace. On Delavan Terrace, the 1854 Smith-Collins House was included in a 1983 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The house was demolished in 2007, and former city-council president Chuck Lesnick called for legislation which would make the demolition of a 75-year-old landmark in the city subject to the landmark-review process.

Neighborhoods include Nepera Park, Runyon Heights, Homefield, Glenwood, and Greystone. Landmarks include the Hudson River Museum, the Lenoir Nature Preserve, and Untermyer Park and Gardens.

The two-block section of Palisade Avenue between Chase and Roberts Avenues in northwest Yonkers is colloquially known as &quot;the north end&quot; or &quot;the end&quot;. The only retail area in northwest Yonkers, it was known for its soda fountain, Urich&#x27;s Stationery, and Robbins Pharmacy. It was the end of a trolley line that has since been replaced by a Bee-line Bus route. Nepperhan Avenue in Nepera Park is a shopping district in the area.

===Southeast Yonkers===
Residents of southeast Yonkers are primarily Irish- and Italian-American. A number of recent immigrants from Ireland live in the area. Its architecture more closely resembles that of parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island than of points north. Southeast Yonkers is within walking distance of the Woodlawn and Wakefield neighborhoods of the Bronx.

Eastern McLean Avenue, home to an Irish community shared with Woodlawn, is considered the hub of Yonkers by some. A portion of Midland Avenue in the Dunwoodie neighborhood has been called the city&#x27;s Little Italy. Southeast Yonkers landmarks include the Cross County Shopping Center, Yonkers Raceway and St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Dunwoodie, which was visited by Pope John Paul II in October 1995 and by Pope Benedict XVI in April 2008.

===Southwest Yonkers===

Getty Square is Yonkers&#x27; downtown and its civic center and central business district. Much of southwest Yonkers grew along the railroad and trolley (now bus) lines along South Broadway and in Getty Square which run to New York City. Clusters of apartment buildings surrounded the stations of the Yonkers branch of the New York and Putnam Railroad and the Third Avenue Railway trolley lines; these buildings are now served by the Bee-Line Bus System. The railroad companies built neighborhoods of mixed housing which ranged from apartment buildings to large mansions in areas such as Park Hill, where a funicular accessed the train station in the valley.

Off South Broadway and Yonkers Avenue are residential neighborhoods such as Lowerre, Nodine Hill, Park Hill, and Hudson Park. They have a mixture of architectural styles which include dense clusters of apartment buildings, blocks of stores with apartments above, multifamily row houses, and detached single-family homes. The Ludlow Park, Hudson Park, and Van Cortlandt Crest neighborhoods have a larger number of detached houses.

Southwest Yonkers, traditionally home to African American and white residents, has seen an influx of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. Many residents are of African, Caribbean, Italian, Polish, or Mexican descent. Some neighborhoods on the Riverdale border contain an increasing number of Orthodox Jews.

The area is home to historical and educational institutions which include Philipse Manor Hall, the Science Barge, the Beczak Environmental Education Center, and a 2003 Yonkers Public Library building. The revitalization of Getty Square has helped facilitate the growth of southwest Yonkers. During the early 21st century, several luxury apartment buildings were built along the Hudson River. A Victorian-era pier was renovated, and a new public library was housed in the remodeled Otis Elevator factory. Peter X. Kelly&#x27;s restaurant, X20 Xaviar&#x27;s on the Hudson, is on the renovated pier. In 2020, several more rental buildings were placed at the river&#x27;s edge on Alexander Street. Sawyer Place is an 18-story building on the site of the original old mill. New proposals and current projects are intended to revitalize downtown Yonkers.

==Government==
Phillipse Manor Hall was the site of the first Yonkers Village Hall and City Hall from 1868 to . Yonkers is governed by a strong mayor–council system. The Yonkers City Council has seven members: six, elected from each of the six districts, and a president. The mayor and city-council president are elected in a citywide vote. The mayor is Democrat Mike Spano, and the council president is Lakisha Collins-Bellamy.

Yonkers, like the rest of Westchester County and New York state, is a Democratic stronghold at the national level. The city chose George H. W. Bush over Bill Clinton and Ross Perot for president in 1992, but has voted solidly Democratic ever since. Recent mayors have included Republicans Phil Amicone and John Spencer, and the city council has been primarily controlled by Republicans. Yonkers is represented in the State Assembly, by Democrats J. Gary Pretlow and Nader Sayegh, and in the State Senate by Democrats Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Shelley Mayer. In the House of Representatives, Democrat Jamaal Bowman represents the city.

== Education ==
Yonkers Public Schools operates the city&#x27;s public schools. There are several elementary Catholic schools, and one Muslim school; the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Catholic schools in Westchester County. The Academy for Jewish Religion, a rabbinical and cantorial school, is in the Getty Square neighborhood.

Sarah Lawrence College, with a Bronxville mailing address, is located in Yonkers. Westchester Community College (part of the State University of New York system) operates a number of extension centers in Yonkers, with the largest in the Cross County Shopping Center. Saint Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary is in Crestwood. The Japanese School of New York was in Yonkers for one year; the school moved to Queens on August 18, 1991, and to Greenwich, Connecticut on September 1, 1992.

Three branches are operated by the Yonkers Public Library: Crestwood, Riverfront, and Grinton I. Will. The Carnegie Library, funded by Andrew Carnegie, was demolished in May 1982 to make way for the expansion of Nepperhan Avenue as an arterial road.

== Transportation ==
=== Mass transit ===
Yonkers has the eleventh-highest rate of public-transit ridership among cities in the United States, and 27 percent of the city&#x27;s households do not own a car. Bus service is provided by the Westchester County Bee-Line Bus System (the state&#x27;s second-largest bus system), and the MTA Bus Company has express routes to Manhattan. Yonkers is the top terminus of the Bee-Line Bus service area, which includes Westchester and the northern Bronx, and the Getty Square intermodal hub serves millions of passengers per year.

The Metro-North Railroad serves Yonkers with two heavy-rail commuter lines: the Hudson Line and the Harlem Line. The Ludlow, Yonkers, Glenwood, and Greystone stations are on the Hudson Line, which provides commuter service to New York City. The Yonkers station is also served by all of Amtrak&#x27;s named Empire Service trains except for the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;. Several Harlem Line stations are on or near the city&#x27;s eastern border. These include Wakefield, Mount Vernon West, Fleetwood, Bronxville, Tuckahoe and Crestwood.

The area was served by the commuter New York and Putnam Railroad from the late 19th century until its closure in 1958. Its right-of-way has been paved and is used as a public park and part of the Empire State Trail, which spans from New York City to Buffalo and Rouses Point via Albany. Until December 2009, New York Water Taxi operated a ferry service from downtown Yonkers to Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. From 2018 to 2020, Yonkers had a dockless bikeshare program operated by LimeBike. It has an electric-scooter program which was begun in August 2020 by Bird, making Yonkers the first city in New York with such a program.

===Roads and paths===

Limited-access highways in Yonkers include Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway) and the Saw Mill, Bronx River, Sprain Brook and Cross County Parkways. US 9, NY 9A, and NY 100 are major surface streets.

The main line of the former New York and Putnam Railroad has been converted into the South County Trailway, a paved walking and bicycling path. It runs north–south in Yonkers from the Hastings-on-Hudson border in the north to the Bronx border in the south at Van Cortlandt Park, where it is known as the Putnam Greenway. The Croton Aqueduct tunnel has a hard-packed dirt trail, the Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway, running above it for most of its length in Yonkers; a few on-street routes are on the edge of the Getty Square neighborhood.

== Fire department ==

The city is served by the Yonkers Fire Department (YFD), which has 459 firefighters under the command of a fire commissioner and three deputy chiefs. Founded in 1896, the YFD operates from 14 fire stations throughout the city in two battalions commanded by two assistant chiefs for each shift. The department responds to about 16,000 emergency calls annually. In its fire apparatus fleet, the YFD has 10 engine companies, six ladder companies, one squad (rescue-pumper) company, one rescue company, one fireboat, one air cascade unit, one USAR (urban search and rescue) collapse unit, one foam unit, one hazmat unit, and several special, support, and reserve units.

== Economy ==
Yonkers is home to several brewing companies, most notably the Simple Motive Brewing Company and Yonkers Brewing Company. The Yonkers Brewing Company opened in 2015 in the Yonkers Trolley Barn, a former trolley station which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Before its opening, brewing in the city had been associated with former mobster Dutch Schultz. The Simple Motive Brewing Company opened in the Carpet Mills Art District at the Mills, a former warehouse, in 2023 after years of delays.

The city had an unemployment rate of 18.7 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, with about 17,800 people out of work. The unemployment rate increased to 19.4 percent in July 2020, the highest in Yonkers history. Unemployment was 2.8 percent in April 2023, the lowest in city history.

Yonkers was where Otis Elevator Company was founded in 1867 along with a plant that operated until 1981 and site became Kawasaki Railcar Manufacturing car plant.

<text>Cruel Intentions is a 1999 American teen romantic drama film written and directed by Roger Kumble, and starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon, and Selma Blair. The film, set in New York City among rich high schoolers, is a modern retelling of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos&#x27; 1782 novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;.

Initially a smaller-budget independent film, it was picked up by Columbia Pictures and widely released on March 5, 1999. Despite mixed critical reviews, the performances of Gellar, Philippe, and Witherspoon were praised and the film grossed $76 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has become regarded as a cult classic.

Its box office success spawned a media franchise with a prequel in 2000 and a sequel in 2004, as well as a jukebox musical in 2015 and a 2024 television series.

==Plot==
In New York City, wealthy teenager Sebastian Valmont regularly manipulates and seduces women, but seeks someone who poses a challenge to his charm. He settles on Annette Hargrove—the daughter of his new school headmaster—who is staunchly opposed to sex before falling in love. Sebastian and his equally manipulative stepsister, the intelligent and popular Kathryn Merteuil, agree to a bet: if Sebastian fails to seduce Annette then Kathryn gets his vintage Jaguar XK140; if he wins Kathryn will finally have sex with him. Kathryn tries to recruit Sebastian into her own scheme to take revenge on her ex-boyfriend Court Reynolds, who left her because of her promiscuity and began dating the naive and innocent Cecile Caldwell.

Sebastian&#x27;s initial efforts to seduce Annette fail as she has been informed of his reputation. He suspects Annette&#x27;s friend Greg, a closeted homosexual, of being responsible and blackmails him into convincing Annette of his good nature. Sebastian also learns that Cecile&#x27;s mother warned Annette and agrees to corrupt Cecile as revenge. Kathryn notices romantic tension between Cecile and her young music teacher Ronald Clifford and reveals this to Cecile&#x27;s mother, who fires Ronald. Sebastian and Kathryn convince Ronald to fight for Cecile by writing her a love letter which Sebastian uses to lure Cecile to his bedroom, where he blackmails her into receiving oral sex from him. The next day, Kathryn advises Cecile to have sex with Sebastian and be as promiscuous as possible so she can please Ronald.

Spending time with Annette, Sebastian develops genuine feelings for her, attracted to her honesty and ability to make the normally stoic Sebastian laugh. He kisses Annette but she resists because she also has feelings for him and fears she cannot restrain herself around him. Sebastian calls her a hypocrite for rejecting the opportunity for true love and she finally relents and begins undressing, but Sebastian, confused about his own feelings, declines to have sex with her. Annette leaves the following day but Sebastian finds her, professes his feelings, and they have sex.

A jealous Kathryn tries to seduce Sebastian, but is frustrated that her hold over him has been broken by his feelings for Annette, and she convinces him that he cannot change his true nature. Sebastian plans to tell Annette the truth about the bet but Kathryn warns him that he will only destroy both his and Annette&#x27;s reputations. He devastates Annette by lying that he only wanted her for sex and feels nothing for her. Sebastian tells Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and, having won the bet, wants his reward, but she dismisses him. Kathryn reveals that he was the true target of her scheme and that she manipulated him into feeling shame over his love for Annette for her own amusement.

Sebastian tries to contact Annette to confess the truth and beg for a second chance, but she refuses to see him. He gives her his journal, in which he has detailed Kathryn&#x27;s manipulative schemes, their bet, and his true feelings for Annette. Seeking revenge, Kathryn calls Ronald, claiming that Sebastian hurt her and slept with Cecile. Ronald violently confronts Sebastian, and the ensuing fight migrates to the middle of the street. Annette tries to intervene but is thrown into traffic and Sebastian is fatally wounded pushing her to safety. Sebastian and Annette confess their love for each other before he dies.

At Sebastian&#x27;s funeral, Kathryn, unmoved by Sebastian&#x27;s death, begins to deliver a eulogy, but people leave before she can finish. Kathryn rushes outside to find Cecile handing out copies of Sebastian&#x27;s journal, titled &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. As the details of her manipulations, promiscuity, and drug abuse are made public, Kathryn weeps as her reputation and good-girl persona are destroyed. Annette drives down a highway in Sebastian&#x27;s car while wearing his sunglasses and with his journal at her side, recalling their fondest moments together.

The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;This darkly comic drama and its attractive young cast are easy on the eyes, but uneven performances and an uninspired script conspire to foil &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;You have the queasy sense that the whole thing is just an elaborate stunt and, in this case, an exploitative one.&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; and gave the film three out of four stars in his review, stating that it was &quot;smart and merciless in the tradition of the original story&quot;.

== Subsequent media ==

=== Direct-to-video films ===
&quot;Cruel Intentions 2&quot; was released direct-to-video in 2001, written and directed by Roger Kumble, assembled from three episodes filmed for &quot;Manchester Prep&quot;, a prequel series scrapped by Fox. The story features younger versions of Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil played by Robin Dunne and Amy Adams, respectively.

&quot;Cruel Intentions 3&quot; followed in 2004, directed by Scott Ziehl, starring Kerr Smith and Kristina Anapau, as Cassidy Merteuil, cousin to Kathryn.

None of the cast from the original appeared in the sequels.

===Canceled sequel series===

NBC picked up a television pilot for a continuation of the film&#x27;s storyline in October 2015. The pilot was set seventeen years after the events of the film and sees Bash Casey, son of Sebastian Valmont and Annette Hargrove, discover his late father&#x27;s journal. Upon discovering this he is thrown into a world of lies, sex, and power. The potential series was to have Kathryn Merteuil, Bash&#x27;s step-aunt, attempt to gain power of Valmont International.

In February 2016, Taylor John Smith and Samantha Logan were cast, with Smith playing the male lead role of Bash Casey, Sebastian Valmont and Annette Hargrove&#x27;s son. Gellar reached a deal with producers to reprise her role as the female lead, Kathryn Merteuil. In March, Kate Levering was cast to replace Witherspoon for the role of Annette Hargrove.

Several months later, on October 31, NBC passed on the project and the series did not go forward.

===Amazon Prime Video reboot series===

In October 2021, a television series reboot of &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; was in development for IMDb TV (now Amazon Freevee). In April 2023, the reboot was given a series order. It premiered on Amazon Prime Video on November 21, 2024.

===Musical===

A 1990s jukebox musical by Kumble, Rosin, and Ross, was first staged in 2015. After two runs in Los Angeles and a pop-up engagement in New York, &quot;Cruel Intentions: The &#x27;90s Musical&quot; made its Off-Broadway debut at the Greenwich Village nightclub Le Poisson Rouge in November 2017 and ran through April 2018. Set to pop and rock hits of the 1990s and songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, the plot follows the manipulations of Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Merteuil, out to destroy anyone who gets in their way.

<doc id="93560" wikidata="Q44063" url="?curid=93560" title="Reese Witherspoon">
<text>Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon (born March 22, 1976) is an American actress and producer. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2006 and 2015, and &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her among the world&#x27;s 100 most powerful women in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; named her the world&#x27;s highest earning actress, and in 2023, she was named one of the richest women in America with an estimated net worth of $440 million.

Witherspoon began her career as a teenager, making her screen debut in &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; (1991). After starring in the 1996 films &quot;Freeway&quot; and &quot;Fear&quot;, her breakthrough came in 1999 with a supporting role in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, and for her portrayal of Tracy Flick in the black comedy &quot;Election&quot;. She gained wider recognition for playing Elle Woods in the comedy &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2001) and its 2003 sequel, and for starring in the romantic comedy &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002). She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying June Carter Cash in the musical biopic &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2005). Following a career downturn, during which her sole box-office success was the romantic drama &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; (2011), Witherspoon made a comeback by producing and starring as Cheryl Strayed in the drama &quot;Wild&quot; (2014), which earned her a second Academy Award nomination.

She has since worked primarily in television, producing and starring in several female-led literary adaptations under her company Hello Sunshine. These include the HBO drama series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; (2017–2019), the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (2019–present), and the Hulu miniseries &quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; (2020). For the first of these, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. She has also produced the film adaptations &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014) and &quot;Where the Crawdads Sing&quot; (2022), and the miniseries adaptation &quot;Daisy Jones &amp; the Six&quot; (2023).

Witherspoon also owns Reese&#x27;s Book Club and a clothing company, Draper James. She is involved in children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of Avon Products in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation dedicated to women&#x27;s causes.

==Early life and education ==
Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976, at Southern Baptist Hospital, in New Orleans, Louisiana, while her father, John Draper Witherspoon, was a student at Tulane University medical school. Her father was born in Georgia and served as a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve. He was in private practice as an otolaryngologist until 2012. Her mother, Mary Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (née Reese) Witherspoon, is from Harriman, Tennessee. She was a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University and had a PhD in pediatric nursing.

Reese Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence. However, this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists. Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996.

Witherspoon was raised an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the &quot;definitive Southern upbringing&quot; she received. She has said it gave her &quot;a sense of family and tradition&quot; and taught her about &quot;being conscientious about people&#x27;s feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life&quot;. At age seven, she was selected as a model for a florist&#x27;s television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age 11, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. She received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself &quot;a big dork who read loads of books&quot;. On mentioning her love for books, she said, &quot;I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything.&quot; She has been described as a &quot;multi-achiever&quot; and was nicknamed &quot;Little Type A&quot; by her parents. She attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls&#x27; Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, but left prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
===1991–2000: Early work and breakthrough===
Witherspoon attended an open casting call in 1991 for &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;, intending to audition for a bit part; but instead was cast for the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl who falls in love for the first time with her 17-year-old neighbor. The film takes place in her native State of Louisiana. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, her performance made an early impression. Film critic Roger Ebert commented, &quot;Her first kiss is one of the most perfect little scenes I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie.&quot; For her role, Witherspoon was nominated for a Young Artist Award, in the category of Best Young Actress. Later that year, she made her television debut role in &quot;Wildflower&quot; with Patricia Arquette. In 1992, Witherspoon appeared in the television film &quot;Desperate Choices: To Save My Child&quot;, portraying a critically ill young girl.

In 1993, Witherspoon played a young wife, Nonnie Parker, in the CBS miniseries &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot;, appeared in the Disney film &quot;A Far Off Place,&quot; and had a minor role in &quot;Jack the Bear&quot;, which garnered her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star. The next year, she had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film &quot;S.F.W.&quot;, directed by Jefery Levy. In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller &quot;Fear&quot; alongside Mark Wahlberg, as Nicole Walker, a teenager who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller &quot;Freeway&quot;, alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields, in which she played Vanessa Lutz; a poor girl living in Los Angeles who encounters a serial killer on the way to her grandmother&#x27;s home in Stockton. The film received positive reviews from critics; &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; Mick LaSalle wrote, &quot;Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other.&quot; Witherspoon&#x27;s performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and helped establish her as a rising star. The production of the film also gave her significant acting experience; she said &quot;Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie – which scared me to death – I felt like I could try anything.&quot;

In 1998, Witherspoon had major roles in three films: &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot;, &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot;. In &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, she starred with Tobey Maguire in a tale about 1990s teenage siblings who are magically transported into the setting of a 1950s television series. She portrayed Jennifer, the sister of Maguire&#x27;s character who is mainly concerned about appearances, relationships and popularity. Her performance earned her praise and garnered her the Young Hollywood Award for Best Female Breakthrough Performance. Director Gary Ross applauded her efforts saying, &quot;she commits to a character so completely and she understands comedy&quot;.

A year later, Witherspoon co-starred with Alessandro Nivola in the drama thriller &quot;Best Laid Plans&quot;; she played Lissa, a woman who schemes with her lover Nick to escape a small dead-end town. Also in 1999, she co-starred with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe in the drama &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, a modern version of the 18th-century French novel &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot;. The critic for &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised her performance as Annette Hargrove: &quot;Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series of cute devilish faces, she pulls it off.&quot; She also appeared in a music video by Marcy Playground for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Next, she appeared in &quot;Election&quot; (1999) opposite Matthew Broderick, based on Tom Perrotta&#x27;s novel of the same name. For her portrayal of Tracy Flick, she earned acclaim and her first nominations in the Golden Globes and in the Independent Spirit Awards. She also won the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics and the Online Film Critics Society. Witherspoon received a rank on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time&quot; by &quot;Premiere&quot;. Director Alexander Payne said &quot;She&#x27;s [Witherspoon] got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that&#x27;s just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything.&quot;

Following the success of &quot;Election&quot;, Witherspoon struggled to find work due to typecasting. &quot;I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I&#x27;d always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn&#x27;t losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about&quot;, she said. In 2000, Witherspoon had a supporting role in &quot;American Psycho&quot; as Patrick Bateman&#x27;s trophy girlfriend, and made a cameo appearance in &quot;Little Nicky&quot; as the mother of the Antichrist. She also made a guest appearance in the sixth season of &quot;Friends&quot; as Rachel Green&#x27;s sister Jill.

===2001–2006: Worldwide recognition===
The 2001 film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; marked a turning point in Witherspoon&#x27;s career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, &quot;When I read &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, I was like, &#x27;She&#x27;s from Beverly Hills, she&#x27;s rich, she&#x27;s in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.&#x27; So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can&#x27;t hate.&quot; &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; was a box-office hit, grossing US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon&#x27;s performance earned her praise from critics, and the press began to refer her as &quot;the new Meg Ryan&quot;. Roger Ebert commented, &quot;Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit&quot;, and the critic from &quot;Salon&quot; magazine wrote &quot;she [Witherspoon] delineates Elle&#x27;s character beautifully&quot;. Meanwhile, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; concluded, &quot;Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly.&quot; The film earned her a second nomination for Best Actress at the Golden Globes, and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.

In 2002, Witherspoon featured in several projects, such as the role of Greta Wolfcastle in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot;, and as Cecily in the comedy &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination. Later that year, she starred with Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey in Andy Tennant&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, in which she played Melanie Carmichael, a young fashion designer who intends to marry a New York politician but must return to Alabama to divorce her childhood sweetheart, from whom she has been separated for seven years. Witherspoon regarded it as a &quot;personal role&quot; as it reminded her of the experience of moving from Nashville to Los Angeles. The film became Witherspoon&#x27;s biggest live-action box office hit, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million in the U.S. Despite the commercial success, critics gave &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; negative reviews. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; called it &quot;a romantic comedy so rote, dull and predictable&quot;, and the press opined that Witherspoon was the only reason the film attracted such a large audience. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote of her, &quot;She is not the movie&#x27;s main attraction, she is its only attraction.&quot;

The next year, Witherspoon followed up the success of &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; by starring in the sequel &quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde&quot;. Elle Woods has become a Harvard-educated lawyer who is determined to protect animals from cosmetics industry science tests. The sequel was not as financially successful as the first film and it generated mostly negative reviews. &quot;USA Today&quot; considered the movie &quot;plodding, unfunny and almost cringe-worthy&quot;, but also wrote &quot;Reese Witherspoon still does a fine job portraying the fair-haired lovable brainiac, but her top-notch comic timing is wasted on the humorless dialogue.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Salon&quot; magazine concluded that the sequel &quot;calcifies everything that was enjoyable about the first movie&quot;. Despite being panned by critics, the sequel took in over $39 million in its first five days in the U.S. box office charts and eventually grossed $90 million in the US. Witherspoon was paid $15 million for the role—a starting point which would make her consistently one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actresses between 2002 and 2010.

In 2004, Witherspoon starred in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, adapted from the 19th-century classic novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and directed by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal her pregnancy during filming. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had helped her portrayal of Sharp&#x27;s character: &quot;I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with&quot;, she said. The film, and Witherspoon&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote &quot;Nair&#x27;s cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness.&quot; &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; called her work &quot;an excellent performance that&#x27;s soft around the edges&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concluded that Becky is &quot;a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play&quot;. However, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;[Witherspoon] ends up conveying so little of what&#x27;s at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair&quot; and stated that it may have to do with Witherspoon&#x27;s vanity, &quot;with an Oscar-less young star&#x27;s need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the &#x27;real&#x27; Becky Sharp.&quot; Some critics thought she was miscast.

In late 2004, Witherspoon starred alongside Mark Ruffalo in the romantic comedy &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;. Her character, Elizabeth Masterson, is an ambitious young doctor who is involved in a car accident on her way to a blind date and is left in a coma; her spirit returns to her old apartment where she later finds true love. Next, she was cast as June Carter Cash, the second wife of singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in James Mangold&#x27;s &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2005). She never had the chance to meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; at the time the singer died. Witherspoon performed her own vocals in the film, and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience; she was so worried about needing to perform that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. &quot;That was the most challenging part of the role,&quot; she later recalled. &quot;I&#x27;d never sung professionally.&quot; Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role, including from the help of vocal coach Roger Love. Witherspoon&#x27;s portrayal of Carter Cash was acclaimed by critics, with Roger Ebert stating that her performance added &quot;boundless energy&quot; to the film. She won Best Actress at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild award for her performance.

Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for &quot;collaborative video of the year&quot; from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon has expressed her passion for the film: &quot;I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems.&quot; She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: &quot;I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn&#x27;t really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn&#x27;t try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman.&quot; After the success of &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, Witherspoon starred in the fantasy &quot;Penelope&quot;, as Annie, the best friend of Penelope (Christina Ricci), a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by her company Type A Films, and filming began in March 2006. The film premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, but went unreleased until February 2008.

===2007–2012: Career setbacks and romantic comedy films===
Witherspoon admits to spending several years &quot;kind of floundering career-wise&quot;. Reflecting on this period of time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to the split from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent &quot;a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can&#x27;t really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs.&quot; She claims that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren&#x27;t responding to anything I was putting out there.&quot;

Witherspoon appeared in the thriller &quot;Rendition,&quot; in which she played Isabella El-Ibrahim, the pregnant wife of a bombing suspect. The film was released in October 2007 and it was her first film appearance since the 2005&#x27;s &quot;Walk the Line&quot;. The film received mostly mixed reviews and was deemed a major disappointment at the Toronto International Film Festival. Witherspoon&#x27;s performance was also criticized; writing for &quot;USA Today&quot;, Claudia Puig wrote &quot;Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly lifeless [...] She customarily injects energy and spirit into her parts, but here, her performance feels tamped down.&quot; In 2008, Witherspoon starred with Vince Vaughn in the comedy &quot;Four Christmases&quot;, a story about a couple who must spend their Christmas Day trying to visit all four of their divorced parents. Despite negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, earning more than $120 million domestically and $157 million worldwide. In 2009, Witherspoon voiced Susan Murphy, the lead character in the DreamWorks Animation &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, released in March, which grossed $381 million worldwide. She also co-produced the &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; spin-off &quot;Legally Blondes&quot;, starring Milly and Becky Rosso. However, Witherspoon did not appear in a live-action film for two years after &quot;Four Christmases&quot;. She told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that the &quot;break&quot; was unplanned, stating that, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t read anything I liked... There are a lot of really, really, really big movies about robots and things—and there&#x27;s not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie.&quot;

Witherspoon returned with three romances released in 2010, 2011 and 2012, all starring her as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men. In the first, she was cast in James L. Brooks&#x27; &quot;How Do You Know,&quot; in which she played a former national softball player who struggles to choose between a baseball-star boyfriend (Owen Wilson) and a business executive being investigated for white-collar crime (Paul Rudd). Filming took place in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. during the summer and fall of 2009 and it was released on December 17, 2010. The film was critically and commercially unsuccessful; with a budget of more than $100 million, the film only earned $48.7 million worldwide, leading the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; to call it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s biggest flops&quot;. The film received mainly unfavorable reviews, with an approval rating of 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 111 reviews as of December 2010.

Witherspoon&#x27;s second love-triangle film was the drama &quot;Water for Elephants,&quot; an adaptation of Sara Gruen&#x27;s novel of the same name. She began circus training in March 2010 for her role as Marlena, a glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband (Christoph Waltz) but intrigued by the circus&#x27; new veterinarian (Robert Pattinson). Principal photography began between May and early August 2010 in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011, and received mixed critical reviews. Her last love-triangle film began production in Vancouver in September 2010. Directed by McG and released by 20th Century Fox, &quot;This Means War&quot;, saw Witherspoon&#x27;s character at the center of a battle between best friends (played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy), who are both in love with her. The film had a &quot;sneak-peek&quot; release on Valentine&#x27;s Day, before fully opening on February 17, 2012. The film was panned by critics, with a 25% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and fared poorly at the box office, taking fifth place on its opening weekend with sales of $17.6 million. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that this &quot;extended the box office cold streak for the Oscar-winning Ms. Witherspoon&quot;. In a 2012 interview with MTV, Witherspoon jokingly referred that 2010–12 was her &quot;love triangle period&quot;.

===2012–2015: Resurgence and career expansion===
In September 2011, a year after beginning work on &quot;This Means War&quot;, she filmed a small role in Jeff Nichols&#x27;s coming-of-age drama &quot;Mud&quot; in Arkansas, playing Juniper, the former girlfriend of a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey), who enlists two local boys to help him evade capture and rekindle his romance with her. &quot;Mud&quot; premiered in May 2012 in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but did not win. Following its American debut at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2013, the film had a limited release in selected North American theaters on April 26, 2013.

Witherspoon next starred in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Knot&quot;, which was directed by Atom Egoyan, and based on the true crime book of the same name, examining the controversial case of the West Memphis Three. Like &quot;Mud&quot;, the film is set in Arkansas. She played Pam Hobbs, the mother of one of three young murder victims. In an interview subsequent to her casting in the film, Egoyan noted that although the role requires &quot;an emotionally loaded journey,&quot; he &quot;met with Reese, and... talked at length about the project, and she&#x27;s eager to take on the challenge.&quot; Filming took place in Georgia in June and July 2012, and Witherspoon was pregnant with her third child during filming. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by a release in selected American theaters on May 9, 2014. Although the film received mainly negative reviews; London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; thought Witherspoon was &quot;the strongest, most involving character&quot;.

In 2012, Witherspoon founded production company Pacific Standard (now part of Hello Sunshine). Her goal was to produce projects with &quot;strong&quot; female lead characters, as she felt this was lacking in Hollywood. Through the company, Witherspoon served as a producer for &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), an adaptation of Gillian Flynn&#x27;s novel of the same name. She also produced and starred in the biographical adventure &quot;Wild&quot; (2014), based on Cheryl Strayed&#x27;s memoir She portrayed Strayed on her hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. &quot;Wild&quot; was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim; Michael Phillips of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote in his review, &quot;Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, and it works. Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed&#x27;s longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism.&quot; &quot;Wild&quot; was considered as Witherspoon&#x27;s &quot;comeback&quot; role following her previous career slump, and she earned a second Academy Award nomination for her performance.

Witherspoon appeared in Philippe Falardeau&#x27;s drama &quot;The Good Lie,&quot; based on a true story about an employment counselor assigned to help four young Sudanese refugees, known as Lost Boys of Sudan, who win a lottery for relocation to the U.S. It was released on October 3, 2014. The film was mostly well-received; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic praised the touching story and performances of the cast, writing that Witherspoon does not &quot;upstage&quot; her colleagues. Next, she appeared in &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014), an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel of the same name. In May 2014, Witherspoon began production in Louisiana on &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, a comedy in which she plays a police officer trying to protect a drug lord&#x27;s widow (Sofía Vergara). The feature was released on May 8, 2015.

===2016–present: Television success===
In 2016, Witherspoon had a voice role in the animated musical comedy film &quot;Sing&quot;, and served as a performer to the film&#x27;s . &quot;Sing&quot; became Witherspoon&#x27;s biggest commercial success, being the first of her films to make over $200 million domestically and $600 million worldwide. That same year, Witherspoon began filming her first television project since 1993&#x27;s &quot;Return To Lonesome Dove&quot;, the seven-part miniseries adaptation of the Liane Moriarty bestseller, &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;. She co-produced the miniseries along with co-star Nicole Kidman and director Jean-Marc Vallée, her second project under his direction. The series premiered on February 19, 2017, on HBO and finished on April 2. Witherspoon garnered critical acclaim for her performance, with &quot;TVLine&quot; proclaiming her as &quot;Performer of the Week&quot; in the weeks of February 26 – March 4 in 2017 and June 23–29 in 2019. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared her performance to her roles in &quot;Election&quot; and &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;. In December 2017, HBO renewed &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; for a second season, which premiered in June 2019. Witherspoon also starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Home Again&quot;, the directorial debut of filmmaker Nancy Meyers&#x27; daughter, Hallie Meyers-Shyer, which was released on September 8, 2017.

In 2018, she starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;, a film adaptation of Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s novel of the same name, in which she plays Mrs. Whatsit. Directed by Ava DuVernay, the feature co-stars Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling, and was released in March 2018. Four months later, Witherspoon began hosting the talk show &quot;Shine On with Reese&quot; on DirecTV, in which she interviews female guests, focusing on how they achieved their ambitions. The show marks Witherspoon&#x27;s first unscripted role in television.

Witherspoon currently produces and stars in the Apple TV+ drama series &quot;The Morning Show&quot; alongside Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell. &quot;The Morning Show&quot; received a two-season order from Apple with the first season premiering in November 2019. Witherspoon was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series for her work in the series. Season two of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; was set to premiere in 2020 before a production shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first two episodes were in the final stages of being shot before the production shutdown. During the shutdown, scripts were rewritten to reflect the pandemic. Production on season two of &quot;The Morning Show&quot; restarted on October 19, 2020, and premiered on Apple TV in September 2021.

==Other ventures==
===Business and philanthropy===
Witherspoon owned a production company called Type A Films, which the media believed was named after a nickname from her childhood, &quot;Little Miss Type A&quot;. However, when asked about the company by &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, she clarified the name&#x27;s origin: &quot;... people think I named it after myself... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [age] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But I just wished I&#x27;d named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life.&quot; In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with Bruna Papandrea&#x27;s &quot;Make Movies&quot; banner to form a new production company called Pacific Standard. In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea parted ways, and Witherspoon gained full control of the company. Pacific Standard has since become a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine, a firm co-owned by Witherspoon and Otter Media, focused on telling female-oriented stories through film, television and digital channels. Witherspoon also runs the Hello Sunshine book club, where she makes book recommendations.

In May 2015, Witherspoon launched Draper James, a retail brand focusing on fashion and home décor inspired by the American South. It is named after her grandparents, Dorothea Draper and William James Witherspoon, who are said to be her greatest influences. Some of the products are being manufactured and designed in-house, and the brand was launched online before opening its first retail outlet in 2015 in her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. In March 2017, Witherspoon became the chief storyteller for Elizabeth Arden, Inc., helping the company to shape the brand&#x27;s narrative through advertising campaigns and marketing programs. Witherspoon stated that she was &quot;excited to work as a creative partner alongside the Elizabeth Arden team, producing content that celebrates the spirit of the brand, highlighting female-centric stories that illustrate women&#x27;s true life experiences which unite us all&quot;.

Witherspoon is involved in children and women&#x27;s rights advocacy. She is a longtime supporter of Save the Children, an organization that helps provide children around the world with education, healthcare and emergency aid. She also serves on the board of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund (CDF), a child advocacy and research group. In 2006, she was among a group of actresses who went to New Orleans, Louisiana in a CDF project to publicize the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims. During this trip, she helped open the city&#x27;s first Freedom School, as she met and talked with the children. Witherspoon later called this an experience that she would never forget.

In 2007, Witherspoon made her first move into endorsements, and she signed a multi-year agreement to serve as the first Global Ambassador for cosmetics firm Avon Products. She acts as a spokeswoman for Avon and serves as the honorary chair of the &quot;Avon Foundation&quot;, a charitable organization that supports women and focuses on breast cancer research and the prevention of domestic violence. She is also committed to the development of cosmetic products and making appearances in commercials. Explaining her motives for joining the foundation, she said, &quot;As a woman and a mother I care deeply about the well being of other women and children throughout the world and through the years, I have always looked for opportunities to make a difference.&quot;

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Witherspoon announced the &quot;Draper James Loves Teachers&quot; initiative, offering free dresses from the clothing collection to teachers.

=== Other work ===
In 2013, Witherspoon recorded a cover of the classic Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra duet, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; with Michael Bublé for his 2013 album, &quot;To Be Loved&quot;. In September 2018, she published her first book, &quot;Whiskey in a Teacup&quot;, which is a lifestyle publication inspired by her southern upbringing. In 2018, she joined approximately 300 other actors, agents, writers and entertainment employees in creating the Time&#x27;s Up initiative, which seeks to counteract sexual harassment in the workplace.

In 2017, Witherspoon started Reese&#x27;s Book Club. The club was born out of her Instagram account, where she posted photos of books she read. Each month she picks books she loves with a woman at the center of the story, with variety of genres, from women&#x27;s fiction to thrillers to romance. Since 2017, the club&#x27;s most influential pick has been &quot;Where the Crawdads Sing&quot; by Delia Owens. Chosen for the club in September 2018, it was adapted into a 2022 feature film by Witherspoon&#x27;s production company Hello Sunshine, and was a box office hit that summer.

Witherspoon hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on September 29, 2001, the first episode to air after the September 11 attacks. In 2005, she was ranked No. 5 in &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of most powerful young Hollywood actors. In 2006, she was listed among the Time 100. Her featured article was written by Luke Wilson. That year, she was selected one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Women In The World&quot; by the readers of &quot;FHM&quot;. Witherspoon has been featured four times in the annual &quot;100 Most Beautiful&quot; issues of &quot;People&quot; magazine. She has appeared on the annual Celebrity 100 list by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2006 and 2007, at No. 75 and No. 80, respectively. &quot;Forbes&quot; also put her on the top ten Trustworthy Celebrities list.

In 2007, she was selected by &quot;People&quot; and the entertainment news program &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; as one of the year&#x27;s best-dressed female stars. The yellow dress she wore to that year&#x27;s Golden Globe Awards was widely acclaimed. A study conducted by E-Poll Market Research showed that Witherspoon was the most likable female celebrity of 2007. That same year, she established herself as the highest-paid actress in the American film industry, earning $15 to $20 million per film. The following years, her appearance in many commercially unsuccessful films caused her to lose this status, and she was noted as one of the most overpaid actors in Hollywood in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In April 2011, she ranked No. 3 on the 22nd annual &quot;People&#x27;s Most Beautiful&quot; issue.

In June 2013, Witherspoon filed a lawsuit against Marketing Advantages International Inc., claiming they extensively used her name and image in jewelry advertising without permission in the U.S. and internationally. In December 2015, Witherspoon&#x27;s trademark claims to her name were rejected on the grounds that she had not established secondary meaning to her full name, did not claim &quot;emotional distress&quot;, and that the &quot;photos and facts were generally known by the public and the photos were taken in public with Plaintiff&#x27;s consent&quot;. However, the court ruled that she could proceed with her right of publicity claims against many defendants. Two months later, she withdrew her lawsuit, having &quot;come to private agreements with the various defendants, including Centerbrook Sales, Fragrance Hut, Gemvara, and others&quot;. In October 2017, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal, Witherspoon revealed that she had been sexually assaulted at age 16 by a director and had had &quot;multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault&quot; throughout her career.

In 2015, Witherspoon made her second appearance on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list, with her featured article written by Mindy Kaling. That year, she was awarded, by the committee&#x27;s unanimous vote, the American Cinematheque for being &quot;a perfect example of an actress flourishing in today&#x27;s world&quot; and &quot;an active and successful movie producer who is moving her career forward both behind and in front of the camera&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported her career earnings were in excess of $198 million, making her the highest-paid primetime Emmy nominee in 2017. In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her among the World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women.

==Personal life==
Witherspoon met actor Ryan Phillippe at her 21st birthday party in March 1997. They became engaged in December 1998 and married on June 5, 1999, at Old Wide Awake Plantation in Hollywood, South Carolina. They have two children together, daughter Ava Elizabeth Phillippe, born on September 9, 1999; and son Deacon Reese Phillippe, born on October 23, 2003. On October 30, 2006, Witherspoon and Phillippe announced their separation. She filed for divorce on November 8, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences. In light of their lack of a prenuptial agreement, she requested that the court refuse to grant spousal support to Phillippe, and asked for joint legal custody and sole physical custody of their two children. Phillippe filed for joint physical custody on May 15, 2007, and did not seek any spousal support. The marriage officially ended on October 5, 2007, with final divorce arrangements settled on June 13, 2008, according to court documents. Phillippe and Witherspoon share joint custody of their children.

Witherspoon dated her &quot;Rendition&quot; co-star Jake Gyllenhaal from 2007 until 2009. In February 2010, she was reported to be dating Jim Toth, a talent agent and co-head of motion picture talent at Creative Artists Agency, where she is a client. They announced their engagement that December, and married on March 26, 2011, in Ojai, California, at Libbey Ranch, Witherspoon&#x27;s country estate, which she later sold. They have a son together, Tennessee James Toth, born on September 27, 2012. On April 19, 2013, Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after Toth was stopped for suspicion of driving under the influence. She pleaded no-contest to obstruction of an officer and was required to pay court costs. In March 2023, Witherspoon and Toth announced their divorce after 11 years of marriage. The couple released a joint statement on Witherspoon&#x27;s Instagram account. The announcement was made a few days shy of their 12th wedding anniversary.

Witherspoon is a practicing Episcopalian and attends church services twice weekly. Describing her faith, she has stated &quot;I believe deeply that there’s a higher power&quot; and that &quot;I don’t fear death, because I know there’s heaven. I know it.&quot;

<doc id="93561" wikidata="Q213525" url="?curid=93561" title="Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand von Steuben ( , ; born Friedrich Wilhelm Ludolf Gerhard Augustin Louis von Steuben; September 17, 1730 – November 28, 1794), also referred to as Baron von Steuben, was a German-born American army officer who played a leading role in the American Revolutionary War by reforming the Continental Army into a disciplined and professional fighting force. His contributions marked a significant improvement in the performance of U.S. troops.

Born into a military family, Steuben was exposed to war from an early age; at 14 years old, he observed his father directing Prussian engineers in the 1744 siege of Prague. At age 16 or 17, he enlisted in the Prussian Army, which was considered the most professional and disciplined in Europe. During his 17 years of military service, Steuben took part in several battles in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), rose to the rank of captain, and became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King Frederick II of Prussia, who was renowned for his military prowess and strategy. Steuben&#x27;s career culminated in his attendance of Frederick&#x27;s elite school for young military officers, after which he was abruptly discharged from the army in 1763, allegedly by the machinations of a rival.

Steuben spent 11 years as court chamberlain to the prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, a small German principality. In 1769, the Duchess of Wurttemberg, a niece of Frederick, named him to the chivalric Order of Fidelity, a meritorious award that conferred the title , or &#x27;free lord&#x27;; in 1771, his service to Hohenzollern-Hechingen earned him the title &quot;baron&quot;. In 1775, as the American Revolution had begun, Steuben saw a reduction in his salary and sought some form of military work; unable to find employment in peacetime Europe, he joined the U.S. war effort through mutual French contacts with U.S. diplomats, most notably ambassadors to France Silas Deane and Benjamin Franklin. Due to his military exploits, and his willingness to serve the Americans without compensation, Steuben made a positive impression on both Congress and General George Washington, who appointed him as temporary Inspector General of the Continental Army.

Appalled by the state of U.S. forces, Steuben took the lead in teaching soldiers the essentials of military drills, tactics, and discipline based on Prussian techniques. He wrote &quot;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States,&quot; which remained the army&#x27;s drill manual for decades, and continues to influence modern U.S. army manuals. Steuben also addressed widespread administrative waste and graft, helping save desperately needed supplies and funds. As these reforms began bearing fruit on the battlefield, in 1778, Congress, on Washington&#x27;s recommendation, commissioned Steuben to the position of Inspector General with the rank of Major General. He served the remainder of the war as Washington&#x27;s chief of staff and one of his most trusted advisors.

After the war, Steuben was made a U.S. citizen and granted a large estate in New York in reward for his service. In 1780, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, a learned society that included many of the nation&#x27;s most prominent Founding Fathers.

==Early life and education==
Baron von Steuben was born in the fortress town of Magdeburg in Prussia (now in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany), on September 17, 1730, the son of Royal Prussian Engineer Capt. Wilhelm von Steuben and his wife, Elizabeth von Jagvodin. When his father entered the service of Empress Anna of Russia, young Friedrich went with him to Crimea and then to Kronstadt, staying until the Russian war against the Turks under General Burkhard Christoph von Münnich. In 1740, Steuben&#x27;s father returned to Prussia and Friedrich was educated in the garrison towns Neisse and Breslau by Jesuits. Despite his education by a Catholic order, von Steuben remained critical of Roman Catholicism. Originally, von Steuben&#x27;s family were Protestants in the Kingdom of Prussia, and after his emigration to America he became a member of the Reformed German Church, a congregation in New York. It is said that at age 14 he served as a volunteer with his father in one of the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession.

==First military service==
Baron von Steuben joined the Prussian Army at age 17. He served as a second lieutenant during the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, and was wounded at the 1757 Battle of Prague. He served as adjutant to the free battalion of General Johann von Mayr and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1759. In August 1759 he was wounded a second time at the Battle of Kunersdorf. In the same year, he was appointed deputy quartermaster at the general headquarters. In 1761 he became adjutant of the Major General Von Knobloch upon being taken prisoner by the Russians at Treptow. He subsequently attained the rank of captain and served as aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great; in 1762 he was one of 13 young officers chosen to participate in a special course of instruction delivered by the king himself.

Upon the reduction of the army at the end of the war, in 1763, Steuben was one of many officers who found themselves unemployed. Towards the end of his life, Steuben indicated in a letter that &quot;an inconsiderate step and an implacable personal enemy&quot; led to his leaving the Prussian army.

==Service in Hohenzollern-Hechingen==
In 1764, Steuben became &quot;Hofmarschall&quot; to Fürst Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, a post he held until 1777. In 1769 the Duchess of Württemberg, niece of Frederick the Great, presented him with the Cross of the Order of &quot;De la Fidelite&quot;. In 1771 he began to use the title baron. That same year he accompanied the prince to France, hoping to borrow money. Failing to find funds, they returned to Germany in 1775, deeply in debt.

In 1763, Steuben had been formally introduced to the future French Minister of War, Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, in Hamburg. They met again in Paris in 1777. The Count, fully realizing the potential of an officer with Prussian general staff training, introduced him to Americans Silas Dean and Benjamin Franklin. The Americans, however, were unable to offer Steuben a rank or pay in the American army. The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay. Promoting these men over qualified American officers caused discontent in the ranks. Steuben would have to go to America strictly as a volunteer and present himself to Congress. Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to Prussia. After unknown events, Steuben was discharged from his position as a captain and traveled to Paris. It is speculated that he was, or was accused of being, homosexual. It is unknown whether or not this occurred, and regardless, no charges were pursued.

Upon the Count&#x27;s recommendation, Steuben was introduced to future president George Washington by means of a letter from Franklin as a &quot;Lieutenant General in the King of Prussia&#x27;s service&quot;, an exaggeration of his actual credentials that appears to be based on a mistranslation of his service record. He was advanced travel funds and left Europe from Marseille on Friday, September 26, 1777, on board the frigate &quot;Flamand&quot;.

==American Revolution==
Steuben, his Italian Greyhound Azor (which he took with him everywhere), his young &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; Louis de Pontière, his military secretary Pierre-Étienne du Ponceau, and two other companions reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire on December 1, 1777. There, they were almost arrested because Steuben and his entourage were wearing red clothing similar to those worn by British troops. They were extravagantly entertained in Boston. On February 5, 1778, Steuben and his party arrived in York, Pennsylvania, where the Continental Congress had relocated after being ousted from Philadelphia by the British advance. 

Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions. He arrived at Valley Forge on February 23, 1778, and reported for duty as a volunteer. One soldier&#x27;s first impression of the Baron was &quot;of the ancient fabled God of War ... he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars. The trappings of his horse, the enormous holsters of his pistols, his large size, and his strikingly martial aspect, all seemed to favor the idea. He turned the volunteers into a great army.&quot;

===Inspector General===
Washington appointed von Steuben as temporary inspector general. He went out into the camp to talk with the officers and men, inspect their huts, and scrutinize their equipment. Steuben established standards of sanitation and camp layouts that would still be standard a century and a half later. There had previously been no set arrangement of tents and huts. Men relieved themselves where they wished, and when an animal died it was stripped of its meat and the rest was left to rot where it lay. Steuben laid out a plan to have rows for command, officers, and enlisted men. Kitchens and latrines were on opposite sides of the camp, with latrines on the downhill side. There was the familiar arrangement of company and regimental streets.

On May 5, 1778, on General Washington&#x27;s recommendation, Congress appointed Steuben inspector general of the army, with the rank and pay of major general. The internal administration had been neglected, and no books had been kept either as to supplies, clothing, or men. Steuben became aware of the &quot;administrative incompetence, graft, war profiteering&quot; that existed. He enforced the keeping of exact records and strict inspections. His inspections saved the army an estimated loss of five to eight thousand muskets.

===Training program===
Steuben used 120 men of the Commander in Chief&#x27;s Guard, and used them to demonstrate military training to the rest of the troops. These men, whom Steuben called the &quot;Model Company&quot; in turn trained other personnel at regimental and brigade levels. Steuben&#x27;s eccentric personality greatly enhanced his mystique. In full military dress uniform, he twice a day trained the soldiers who, at this point, were themselves greatly lacking in proper clothing.

As he could only speak and write a small amount of English, Steuben originally wrote the drills in French, the military language of Europe at the time. His secretary, Du Ponceau, then translated the drills from French into English, with the help of John Laurens and Alexander Hamilton, two of Washington&#x27;s aides-de-camp. They did this every single night so the soldiers could practice the next day. Colonel Alexander Hamilton and General Nathanael Greene were of great help in assisting Steuben in drafting a training program for the Army. The Baron&#x27;s willingness and ability to work with the men, as well as his use of profanity (in several languages), made him popular among the soldiers. It is here he met his close friend and future adopted heir, Captain Benjamin Walker. Within weeks, Walker was Steuben&#x27;s aide-de-camp.

Steuben introduced a system of progressive training, beginning with the school of the soldier, with and without arms, and going through the school of the regiment. This corrected the previous policy of simply assigning personnel to regiments. Each company commander was made responsible for the training of new men, but actual instruction was done by sergeants specifically selected for being the best obtainable.

Upon Steuben&#x27;s initial inspection of the camp and soldiers, he remarked that “the American soldier, never having used this arm, had no faith in it, and never used it but to roast his beefsteak.&quot; Steuben&#x27;s introduction of effective bayonet charges became crucial. In the Battle of Stony Point, Continental Army soldiers attacked with unloaded muskets and won the battle solely on Steuben&#x27;s bayonet training.

The first results of Steuben&#x27;s training were in evidence at the Battle of Barren Hill, May 20, 1778, and then again at the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. Steuben, by then serving in Washington&#x27;s headquarters, was the first to determine that the enemy was heading for Monmouth.

During the winter of 1778–1779, Steuben prepared &quot;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Blue Book&quot;. Its basis was the training plan he had devised at Valley Forge. It was used by the United States Army until 1814, and affected U.S. drills and tactics until the Mexican–American War of 1846.

On May 2, 1779, during the second Middlebrook encampment, a review of the army was held to honor the French minister Conrad Alexandre Gérard de Rayneval and the Spanish diplomat Juan de Miralles. Led by General William Smallwood, four battalions performed precise military formations to demonstrate their mastery of Steuben&#x27;s training. After the review, about sixty generals and colonels attended a dinner hosted by Steuben in a large tent near his headquarters at the Abraham Staats House.

===Southern campaign===
In 1780, Steuben sat on the court-martial of British Major John André, captured and charged with espionage in conjunction with the defection of General Benedict Arnold. He later traveled with Nathanael Greene, the new commander of the Southern campaign. He quartered in Virginia, since U.S. supplies and soldiers would be provided to the army from there. Steuben would help in the defense of Virginia with approximately 1,000 militia fighting a delaying action in the Battle of Blandford. During the spring of 1781, he aided Greene in the campaign in the South, culminating in the delivery of 450 Virginia Continentals to Lafayette in June.

He was forced to take sick leave, rejoining the army for the final campaign at Yorktown, where his role was as commander of one of the three divisions of Washington&#x27;s troops. In 1783, General Von Steuben joined General Knox at Vail&#x27;s Gate, near West Point, in the fall of 1782 and in early 1783 moved to the Verplanck homestead, at Mount Gulian, across the Hudson River from Washington&#x27;s headquarters in Newburgh. Steuben gave assistance to Washington in demobilizing the army in 1783 as well as aiding in the defense plan of the new nation. In May 1783, Steuben presided over the founding of the Society of the Cincinnati. He was discharged from the military with honor on March 24, 1784.

==Final years==

Steuben became a U.S. citizen by act of the Pennsylvania legislature in March 1784 and later by the New York authorities in July 1786. With the war over, Steuben resigned from service and first settled with his longtime companion, William North, for whom he created a special room at his retreat he called the Louvre on Manhattan Island, where he became a prominent figure and elder in the German Reformed Church. From 1785 until his death in 1794, he served as president of the German Society of the City of New York, a charitable society founded in 1784 to assist German immigrants.

In 1786, during Shays&#x27; Rebellion, under the written name &quot;Belisarius&quot;, Steuben criticized the Massachusetts government for being an oligarchy.

On December 23, 1783, the state of New Jersey presented him with the use of an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House, which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781. Located in the formerly strategic New Bridge Landing, the estate included a gristmill and about of land. Legislators initially conditioned the grant, requiring Steuben to &quot;hold, occupy and enjoy the said estate in person, and not by tenant.&quot; General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey Militia informed Steuben of this gift and responded to his inquiries that &quot;there are on the premises an exceeding good House, an excellent barn, together with many useful outbuildings, all of which I am told, want some repairs... there is... a Grist-mill; a good Orchard, some meadow Ground, &amp; plenty of Wood. The distance from N York by land 15 miles, but you may keep a boat &amp; go from your own door to N York by waterOysters, Fish &amp; wild fowl in abundancePossession will be given to you in the Spring, when you will take a view of the premises.&quot; Von Steuben spent considerable sums to repair wartime damages to the house and restore its commercial operations under Walker.

On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben full title to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, recognizing his financial embarrassment, Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: &quot;The Jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it.&quot; On November 6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg, New York), noting &quot;My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money, you so generously lend me and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House.&quot; Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.

Von Steuben was present at the first inauguration of George Washington in New York in 1789.

Von Steuben moved upstate and settled in Oneida County on a small estate in the vicinity of Rome, New York, on land granted to him for his military service and where he had spent summers. He was later appointed a regent for what evolved into the University of the State of New York. In 1790, Congress awarded him a pension of $2,500 a year, which he kept until his death.

==Personal life and death==
Von Steuben died on November 28, 1794, at his estate in Oneida County, and was buried in a grove at what became the Steuben Memorial State Historic Site. The estate became part of the town of Steuben, New York, which was named for him.

Von Steuben is believed by some historians to have been gay.

Von Steuben had arrived in the United States with his 17-year-old secretary and (then speculated to be) lover, Peter Stephen Du Ponceau. In Prussia, he may have had numerous relationships with young soldiers, and also with Prince Henry of Prussia and Frederick the Great.

At Valley Forge, he began close relationships with Walker and William North, then both military officers in their 20s. Von Steuben formally adopted Walker and North and made them his heirs. Some consider this action an indication of Von Steuben&#x27;s homosexuality, as some gay men of the time period would use adoption as a substitution for marriage, to establish a recognized legal relationship and a legal connection to heirs.

He never married and had no children, and he did not care much for his European relatives. Thus, he left his estate to his companions and aides-de-camp, Walker and North, with whom he had had an &quot;extraordinarily intense emotional relationship ... treating them as surrogate sons.&quot; A third young man, John W. Mulligan (1774–1862), who also considered himself one of von Steuben&#x27;s &quot;sons&quot;, inherited his vast library, collection of maps and $2,500 in cash. In his 1781 will, he left the majority of his estate to his nephew, as long as he would move permanently to the United States and reject the title of baron or any other title of nobility. (From Paul Lockhart&#x27;s book.) Following von Steuben&#x27;s death, North divided the property bequeathed to him among his military companions.

==Legacy==
Generally, Von Steuben Day takes place in September in many cities throughout the United States. It is often considered the German American event of the year. Participants march, dance, wear German costumes and play German music, and the event is attended by millions of people. The German-American Steuben Parade is held annually in September in New York City. It is one of the largest parades in the city and is traditionally followed by an Oktoberfest in Central Park as well as celebrations in Yorkville, Manhattan, a historically German section of New York City. The German-American Steuben Parade has been taking place since 1958. Chicago also hosts a von Steuben Day parade, which is featured in the U.S. film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Philadelphia hosts a smaller Steuben Parade in the Northeast section of the city.

The Steuben Society was founded in 1919 as &quot;an educational, fraternal, and patriotic organization of American citizens of German background&quot;. In the difficult post-World War I years the Society helped the German-American community to reorganize. It is now one of the largest organizations for Americans of German descent.

A warship, a submarine, and an ocean liner (later pressed into military service) were named in von Steuben&#x27;s honor. In World War I, the captured German ship was renamed as USS &quot;Von Steuben&quot;, and in World War II there was the Dampfschiff &quot;General von Steuben&quot;, an ill-fated German luxury passenger ship which was turned into an armed transport ship during the war. During the Cold War, the U.S. Navy submarine was named for him.

Several locations in the United States are also named Steuben, most of them in his honor. Examples include Steuben County, New York, Steuben County, Indiana, and the city of Steubenville, Ohio. Several buildings are named for Steuben, among them Von Steuben Metropolitan High School in Chicago, Illinois, as well as one of the cadet barracks buildings at Valley Forge Military Academy and College.

Von Steuben was one of four European military leaders who assisted the U.S. cause during the Revolution and was honored with a statue in Lafayette Square, just north of the White House, in Washington, D.C. The statue by Albert Jaegers was dedicated in 1910. A copy was dedicated in Potsdam, Germany, in 1911, and destroyed during World War II. A new cast was given in honor of German-American friendship in 1987, and to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin. It was installed in the Dahlem district, in what had been the U.S. sector of the formerly divided city. An additional cast is in Steuben&#x27;s home town of Magdeburg. Statues of Steuben by J. Otto Schweizer can be found in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and Utica, New York, in addition to an equestrian statue by Schweizer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A bust of Steuben is in the garden of the German Embassy in Washington, D.C.

The Steuben House, presented to Steuben as a gift for his services in the Continental Army, is located at New Bridge Landing in River Edge, New Jersey. The house and surrounding farmland were seized in 1781 from a Loyalist family. The house looks much as it did after Steuben renovated it. The State of New Jersey took possession of the historic mansion and one acre of ground for $9,000 on June 27, 1928. It was opened as a public museum in September 1939. The Bergen County Historical Society opens the building for special events. It is under the jurisdiction of the Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 1970, for its significance in architecture and military history.

Franciscan University of Steubenville also honors their city&#x27;s namesake by having The Barons as their moniker and mascot.

Other tributes include Steuben Field, the stadium of the Hamilton College football team. Von Steuben, acting as Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s surrogate, laid the cornerstone of the school.

The various depictions of Steuben in popular U.S. media include portrayals by Nehemiah Persoff in the 1979 U.S. TV miniseries &quot;The Rebels&quot;, Kurt Knudson in the 1984 TV miniseries &quot;George Washington&quot;, being voiced by Austrian-American Arnold Schwarzenegger in the animated series &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;, and by David Cross on the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot;.

In 2007, a popular documentary DVD was released by LionHeart FilmWorks and director Kevin Hershberger titled &quot;Von Steuben&#x27;s Continentals: The First American Army&quot;. The 60-minute, live-action documentary details the uniforms, camp life, food, weapons, equipment, and drill of the Continental soldier from 1775 to 1781, as taught and developed by Baron von Steuben.

Principal members of the band are Tom Thiel and Max Loderbauer, with Thomas Fehlmann acting as executive producer on all their releases.

<text>The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-report questionnaire that makes pseudoscientific claims to categorize individuals into 16 distinct &quot;psychological types&quot; or &quot;personality types&quot;.

The MBTI was constructed during World War II by Americans Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, inspired by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung&#x27;s 1921 book &quot;Psychological Types&quot;. The test assigns a binary value to each of four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result representing one of 16 possible types, such as &quot;INFP&quot; or &quot;ESTJ&quot;.

The perceived accuracy of test results relies on the Barnum effect, flattery, and confirmation bias, leading participants to personally identify with descriptions that are somewhat desirable, vague, and widely applicable. As a psychometric indicator, the test exhibits significant deficiencies, including poor validity, poor reliability, measuring supposedly dichotomous categories that are not independent, and not being comprehensive. Most of the research supporting the MBTI&#x27;s validity has been produced by the Center for Applications of Psychological Type, an organization run by the Myers–Briggs Foundation, and published in the center&#x27;s own journal, the &quot;Journal of Psychological Type (JPT)&quot;, raising questions of independence, bias and conflict of interest.

Despite controversies over validity, the instrument has demonstrated widespread influence since its adoption by the Educational Testing Service in 1962. It is estimated that 50 million people have taken the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator and that 10,000 businesses, 2,500 colleges and universities, and 200 government agencies in the United States use the MBTI.

==History==

Briggs began her research into personality in 1917. Upon meeting her future son-in-law, she observed marked differences between his personality and that of other family members. Briggs embarked on a project of reading biographies and subsequently developed a typology wherein she proposed four temperaments: &quot;meditative&quot; (or thoughtful), &quot;spontaneous&quot;, &quot;executive&quot;, and &quot;social&quot;.

After the publication in 1923 of an English translation of Carl Jung&#x27;s book &quot;Psychological Types&quot; (first published in German as in 1921), Briggs recognized that Jung&#x27;s theory resembled, but went far beyond, her own. Briggs&#x27;s four types were later identified as corresponding to the &quot;IXXXs&quot; (Introverts: &quot;meditative&quot;), &quot;EXXPs&quot; (Extraverts &amp; Prospectors: &quot;spontaneous&quot;), &quot;EXTJs&quot; (Extraverts, Thinkers &amp; Judgers: &quot;executive&quot;) and &quot;EXFJs&quot; (Extraverts, Feelers &amp; Judgers: &quot;social&quot;). Her first publications were two articles describing Jung&#x27;s theory, in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box&quot; (1926) and &quot;Up From Barbarism&quot; (1928). After extensively studying the work of Jung, Briggs and her daughter extended their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use. Isabel Myers was particularly fascinated by the concept of introversion and she typed herself as an &quot;INFP&quot;. However, she felt the book was too complex for the general public, and therefore she tried to organize the Jungian cognitive functions to make it more accessible.

Although Myers graduated from Swarthmore College in political science in 1919, neither Myers nor Briggs were formally educated in the discipline of psychology, and both were self-taught in the field of psychometric testing. Myers therefore apprenticed herself to Edward N. Hay (1891–1958), the head personnel officer for a large Philadelphia bank. From Hay, Myers learned rudimentary test &quot;construction&quot;, &quot;scoring&quot;, &quot;validation&quot;, and &quot;statistical&quot; methods.

Briggs and Myers began creating their indicator during World War II (1939–1945) in the belief that a knowledge of personality preferences would help women entering the industrial workforce for the first time to identify the sorts of war-time jobs that would be the &quot;most comfortable and effective&quot; for them. The &quot;Briggs Myers Type Indicator Handbook&quot;, published in 1944, was re-published as &quot;Myers–Briggs Type Indicator&quot; in 1956.

Myers&#x27; work attracted the attention of Henry Chauncey, head of the Educational Testing Service, a private assessment-organization. Under these auspices, the first MBTI &quot;manual&quot; was published, in 1962. The MBTI received further support from Donald W. MacKinnon, head of the Institute of Personality and Social Research at the University of California, Berkeley; W. Harold Grant, a professor at Michigan State University and Auburn University; and Mary H. McCaulley of the University of Florida. The publication of the MBTI was transferred to Consulting Psychologists Press in 1975, and the Center for Applications of Psychological Type was founded as a research laboratory.

After Myers&#x27; death in May 1980, Mary McCaulley updated the MBTI manual, and the second edition was published in 1985. The third edition appeared in 1998.

===Format and administration===
In 1987, an advanced scoring-system was developed for the MBTI. From this was developed the Type Differentiation Indicator (TDI), which is a scoring system for the longer MBTI, Form J, which includes the 290 items written by Myers that had survived her previous item analyses. It yields 20 subscales (five under each of the four dichotomous preference scales), plus seven additional subscales for a new &quot;comfort-discomfort&quot; factor (which parallels, though not perfectly measuring, the NEO-PI factor of neuroticism). This factor&#x27;s scales indicate a sense of overall comfort and confidence versus discomfort and anxiety. They also load onto one of the four type-dimensions:

* guarded-optimistic (T/F),
* defiant-compliant (T/F),
* carefree-worried (T/F),
* decisive-ambivalent (J/P),
* intrepid-inhibited (E/I),
* leader-follower (E/I), and
* proactive-distractible (J/P).

Also included is a composite of these called &quot;strain&quot;. There are also scales for type-scale consistency and comfort-scale consistency. Reliability of 23 of the 27 TDI subscales is greater than 0.50, &quot;an acceptable result given the brevity of the subscales&quot;.

In 1989, a scoring system was developed for only the 20 subscales for the original four dichotomies. This was initially known as &quot;Form K&quot; or &quot;the Expanded Analysis Report&quot;. This tool is now called the MBTI Step II.

Form J or the TDI included the items (derived from Myers&#x27; and McCaulley&#x27;s earlier work) necessary to score what became known as Step III. (The 1998 &quot;MBTI Manual&quot; reported that the two instruments were one and the same) Step III was developed in a joint project involving the following organizations: the Myers–Briggs Company, the publisher of all the MBTI works; the Center for Applications of Psychological Type (CAPT), which holds all of Myers&#x27; and McCaulley&#x27;s original work; and the MBTI Trust headed by Katharine and Peter Myers. CAPT advertised Step III as addressing type development and the use of &quot;perception and judgment&quot; by respondents.

== Concepts ==

The MBTI is based on the influential theory of psychological types proposed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in 1921, which was partially based on the four elements of classical cosmology. Jung speculated that people experience the world using four principal psychological functions—sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking—and that one of these four functions is dominant in an individual, a majority of the time. In MBTI theory, the four categories are introversion/extraversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. According to the MBTI, each person is said to have one preferred quality from each category, producing 16 unique types.

The MBTI emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences. &quot;The underlying assumption of the MBTI is that we all have specific preferences in the way we construe our experiences, and these preferences underpin our interests, needs, values, and motivation.&quot;

The MBTI &quot;Manual&quot; states that the indicator &quot;is designed to implement a theory; therefore, the theory must be understood to understand the MBTI&quot;. Fundamental to the MBTI is the hypothesis of psychological types as originally developed by Carl Jung. Jung proposed the existence of two dichotomous pairs of cognitive functions:
* The &quot;rational&quot; (judging) functions: thinking and feeling.
* The &quot;irrational&quot; (perceiving) functions: sensation and intuition.

Jung believed that for every person, each of the functions is expressed primarily in either an introverted or extraverted form. Based on Jung&#x27;s original concepts, Briggs and Myers developed their own theory of psychological type, described below, on which the MBTI is based. According to psychologist Hans Eysenck writing in 1995 the 16 personality types used in MBTI are incomplete, as Jung&#x27;s theory used 32 types, 16 of which could not be measured by questionnaire. Per Eysenck, it was unfair to Jung to claim the scale accurately measured Jungian concepts. Both Jung&#x27;s original model and the simplified MBTI remain hypothetical, with no controlled scientific studies supporting either.

===Differences from Jung===
Jung did not see the type preferences (such as introversion and extraversion) as dualistic, but rather as tendencies: both are innate and have the potential to balance.

Jung&#x27;s typology theories postulated a sequence of four cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition), each having one of two polar tendencies (extraversion or introversion), giving a total of eight dominant functions. The MBTI is based on these eight hypothetical functions, although with some differences in expression from Jung&#x27;s model. While the Jungian model proposes the first three dichotomies, Myers and Briggs added the judgment-perception preference.

The most notable addition of Myers&#x27; and Briggs&#x27; ideas to Jung&#x27;s original thought is their concept that a given type&#x27;s fourth letter (J or P) indicates a person&#x27;s most preferred extraverted function, which is the dominant function for extraverted types and the auxiliary function for introverted types.

Jung hypothesized that the dominant function acts alone in its preferred world: exterior for extraverts and interior for introverts. The remaining three functions, he suggested, operate in the opposite orientation. Some MBTI practitioners, however, place doubt on this concept as being a category error with next to no empirical evidence backing it relative to other findings with correlation evidence, yet as a theory it still remains part of Myers&#x27; and Briggs&#x27; extrapolation of their original theory despite being discounted.

Jung&#x27;s hypothesis can be summarized as: if the dominant cognitive function is introverted, then the other functions are extraverted and vice versa. The MBTI &quot;Manual&quot; summarizes Jung&#x27;s work of balance in psychological type as follows: &quot;There are several references in Jung&#x27;s writing to the three remaining functions having an opposite attitudinal character. For example, in writing about introverts with thinking dominant ... Jung commented that the counterbalancing functions have an extraverted character.&quot; Using the INTP type as an example, the orientation according to Jung would be as follows:
* Dominant introverted thinking
* Auxiliary extraverted intuition
* Tertiary introverted sensing
* Inferior extraverted feeling

===Type dynamics and development===

Jung&#x27;s typological model regards psychological type as similar to left or right handedness: people are either born with, or develop, certain preferred ways of perceiving and deciding. The MBTI sorts some of these psychological differences into four opposite pairs, or &quot;dichotomies&quot;, with a resulting 16 possible psychological types. None of these are considered to be &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;; however, Briggs and Myers theorized that people innately &quot;prefer&quot; one overall combination of type differences. In the same way that writing with the left hand is difficult for a right-hander, so people tend to find using their opposite psychological preferences more difficult, though they can become more proficient (and therefore behaviorally flexible) with practice and development.

The 16 types are typically referred to by an abbreviation of four lettersthe initial letters of each of their four type preferences (except in the case of intuition, which uses the abbreviation &quot;N&quot; to distinguish it from introversion). For instance:
* ENTJ: extraversion (E), intuition (N), thinking (T), judgment (J) 
* ISFP: introversion (I), sensing (S), feeling (F), perception (P) 
These abbreviations are applied to all 16 types.

The interaction of two, three, or four preferences is known as &quot;type dynamics&quot;. Although type dynamics has received little or no empirical support to substantiate its viability as a scientific theory, Myers and Briggs asserted that for each of the 16 four-preference types, one function is the most &quot;dominant&quot; and is likely to be evident earliest in life. A secondary or &quot;auxiliary&quot; function typically becomes more evident (differentiated) during teenage years and provides balance to the dominant. In normal development, individuals tend to become more fluent with a third, &quot;tertiary&quot; function during mid-life, while the fourth, &quot;inferior&quot; function remains least consciously developed. The inferior function is often considered to be more associated with the unconscious, being most evident in situations such as high stress (sometimes referred to as being &quot;in the grip&quot; of the inferior function).

However, the use of type dynamics is disputed: in the conclusion of various studies on the subject of type dynamics, James H. Reynierse writes, &quot;Type dynamics has persistent logical problems and is fundamentally based on a series of category mistakes; it provides, at best, a limited and incomplete account of type related phenomena&quot;; and &quot;type dynamics relies on anecdotal evidence, fails most efficacy tests, and does not fit the empirical facts&quot;. His studies gave the clear result that the descriptions and workings of type dynamics do not fit the real behavior of people. He suggests getting completely rid of type dynamics, because it does not help, but hinders understanding of personality. The presumed order of functions 1 to 4 did only occur in one out of 540 test results.

=== Four dichotomies ===

The four pairs of preferences or &quot;dichotomies&quot; are shown in the adjacent table.

The terms used for each dichotomy have specific technical meanings relating to the MBTI, which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more &quot;judgmental&quot; or less &quot;perceptive&quot;, nor does the MBTI instrument measure aptitude; it simply indicates for one preference over another. Someone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be correctly described as more extraverted: they simply have a clear preference.

Point scores on each of the dichotomies can vary considerably from person to person, even among those with the same type. However, Isabel Myers considered the direction of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference (for example, very clear vs. slight). The expression of a person&#x27;s psychological type is more than the sum of the four individual preferences. The preferences interact through type dynamics and type development.

=== Attitudes: extraversion/introversion ===
Myers–Briggs literature uses the terms extraversion and introversion as Jung first used them. Extraversion means literally outward-turning and introversion, inward-turning. These specific definitions differ somewhat from the popular usage of the words. Extraversion is the spelling used in MBTI publications.

The preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called &quot;attitudes&quot;. Briggs and Myers recognized that each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior, action, people, and things (&quot;extraverted attitude&quot;) or the internal world of ideas and reflection (&quot;introverted attitude&quot;). The MBTI assessment sorts for an overall preference for one or the other.

People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to decline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in reflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion &quot;expend&quot; energy through action: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their energy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.

An extravert&#x27;s flow is directed outward toward people and objects, whereas the introvert&#x27;s is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting characteristics between extraverted and introverted people include:
* Extraverted are action-oriented, while introverted are thought-oriented.
* Extraverted seek breadth of knowledge and influence, while introverted seek depth of knowledge and influence.
* Extraverted often prefer more frequent interaction, while introverted prefer more substantial interaction.
* Extraverted recharge and get their energy from spending time with people, while introverted recharge and get their energy from spending time alone; they consume their energy through the opposite process.

=== Functions: sensing/intuition and thinking/feeling ===
Jung identified two pairs of psychological functions:
* Two perceiving functions: sensation (usually called sensing in MBTI writings) and intuition
* Two judging functions: thinking and feeling

According to Jung&#x27;s typology model, each person uses one of these four functions more dominantly and proficiently than the other three; however, all four functions are used at different times depending on the circumstances. Because each function can manifest in either an extraverted or an introverted attitude, Jung&#x27;s model includes eight combinations of functions and attitudes, four of which are largely conscious and four unconscious. John Beebe created a model that combines ideas of archetypes and the dialogical self with functions, each function viewed as performing the role of an archetype within an internal dialog.

Sensing and intuition are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions. They describe how new information is understood and interpreted. People who prefer sensing are more likely to trust information that is in the present, tangible, and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the five senses. They tend to distrust hunches, which seem to come &quot;out of nowhere&quot;. They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer intuition tend to trust information that is less dependent upon the senses, that can be associated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking a wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future possibilities. For them, the meaning is in the underlying theory and principles which are manifested in the data.

Thinking and feeling are the decision-making (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both used to make rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it &#x27;from the inside&#x27; and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.

As noted already, people who prefer thinking do not necessarily, in the everyday sense, &quot;think better&quot; than their feeling counterparts, in the common sense; the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming to decisions (and, in any case, the MBTI assessment is a measure of preference, not ability). Similarly, those who prefer feeling do not necessarily have &quot;better&quot; emotional reactions than their thinking counterparts.

==== Dominant function ====
According to Jung, people use all four cognitive functions. However, one function is generally used in a more conscious and confident way. This dominant function is supported by the secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the &quot;shadow.&quot;

The four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.

=== Lifestyle preferences: judging/perception ===
Myers and Briggs added another dimension to Jung&#x27;s typological model by identifying that people also have a preference for using either the &quot;judging&quot; function (thinking or feeling) or their &quot;perceiving&quot; function (sensing or intuition) when relating to the outside world (extraversion).

They held that types with a preference for judging show the world their preferred judging function (thinking or feeling). Those types who prefer perception show the world their preferred perceiving function (sensing or intuition). According to Myers, judging types like to &quot;have matters settled&quot;, while perceptive types prefer to &quot;keep decisions open&quot;. So, TJ types tend to appear to the world as logical and FJ types as empathetic. SP types tend to appear as concrete and NP types as abstract.

The J or P indicates the dominant function for extraverts, whereas for introverts, the J or P indicates their auxiliary function. Introverts tend to show their dominant function outwardly only in matters &quot;important to their inner worlds&quot;.

For example, because the ENTJ type is extraverted, the J indicates that the dominant function is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The ENTJ type introverts the auxiliary perceiving function (introverted intuition). Their tertiary function is sensing and their inferior function is introverted feeling. Conversely, because the INTJ type is introverted, the J instead indicates that the auxiliary function is the preferred judging function (extraverted thinking). The INTJ type introverts the dominant perceiving function (introverted intuition). Their tertiary function is feeling and their inferior function is extraverted sensing.

==Accuracy and validity==
Despite its popularity, the MBTI has been widely regarded as pseudoscience by the scientific community. The validity (statistical validity and test validity) of the MBTI as a psychometric instrument has been the subject of much criticism. Media reports have called the test &quot;pretty much meaningless&quot;, and &quot;one of the worst personality tests in existence&quot;. The psychologist Adam Grant is especially vocal against MBTI. He called it &quot;the fad that won&#x27;t die&quot; in a &quot;Psychology Today&quot; article. Psychometric specialist Robert Hogan wrote: &quot;Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie&quot;. Nicholas Campion comments that this is &quot;a fascinating example of &#x27;disguised astrology&#x27;, masquerading as science in order to claim respectability.&quot;

It has been estimated that between a third and a half of the published material on the MBTI has been produced for the special conferences of the Center for the Application of Psychological Type (which provide the training in the MBTI, and are funded by sales of the MBTI) or as papers in the &quot;Journal of Psychological Type&quot; (which is edited and supported by Myers–Briggs advocates and by sales of the indicator). It has been argued that this reflects a lack of critical scrutiny. Many of the studies that endorse MBTI are methodologically weak or unscientific. A 1996 review by Gardner and Martinko concluded: &quot;It is clear that efforts to detect simplistic linkages between type preferences and managerial effectiveness have been disappointing. Indeed, given the mixed quality of research and the inconsistent findings, no definitive conclusion regarding these relationships can be drawn.&quot;

The test has been likened to horoscopes, as both rely on the Barnum effect, flattery, and confirmation bias, leading participants to personally identify with descriptions that are somewhat desirable, vague, and widely applicable. MBTI is not recommended in counseling.

=== Little evidence for dichotomies ===
As previously stated in the section, Isabel Myers considered the direction of the preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on each MBTI scale would show a bimodal distribution with most people scoring near the ends of the scales, thus dividing people into either, e.g., an extraverted or an introverted psychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the individual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner, similar to a normal distribution, indicating that the majority of people were actually in the middle of the scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extraverted. Most personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to high, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and the majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be scored, a cut-off line is used at the middle of each scale and all those scoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above the line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research fails to support the concept of &quot;type&quot;, but rather shows that most people lie near the middle of a continuous curve.

===Little evidence for &quot;dynamic&quot; type stack===
Some MBTI supporters argue that the application of type dynamics to MBTI (e.g., where inferred &quot;dominant&quot; or &quot;auxiliary&quot; functions like Se / &quot;Extraverted Sensing&quot; or Ni / &quot;Introverted Intuition&quot; are presumed to exist) is a logical category error that has little empirical evidence backing it. Instead, they argue that Myers–Briggs validity as a psychometric tool is highest when each type of category is viewed independently as a dichotomy.

=== Validity and utility ===
The content of the MBTI scales is problematic. In 1991, a National Academy of Sciences committee reviewed data from MBTI research studies and concluded that only the I-E scale has high correlations with comparable scales of other instruments and low correlations with instruments designed to assess different concepts, showing strong validity. In contrast, the S-N and T-F scales show relatively weak validity. The 1991 review committee concluded at the time there was &quot;not sufficient, well-designed research to justify the use of the MBTI in career counseling programs&quot;. This study based its measurement of validity on &quot;criterion-related validity (i.e. does the MBTI predict specific outcomes related to interpersonal relations or career success/job performance?).&quot; The committee stressed the discrepancy between popularity of the MBTI and research results stating, &quot;the popularity of this instrument in the absence of proven scientific worth is troublesome.&quot; There is insufficient evidence to make claims about utility, particularly of the four letter type derived from a person&#x27;s responses to the MBTI items.

=== Lack of objectivity ===
The accuracy of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting. Unlike some personality questionnaires, such as the 16PF Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or the Personality Assessment Inventory, the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or socially desirable responses. As a result, individuals motivated to do so can fake their responses. One study found a weak but statistically significant correlation between the MBTI judging scale and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire lie scale, suggesting that more socially conformant individuals are more likely to be considered judging according to the MBTI. If respondents &quot;fear they have something to lose, they may answer as they assume they &quot;should&quot;.&quot; However, the MBTI ethical guidelines state, &quot;It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants.&quot; The intent of the MBTI is to provide &quot;a framework for understanding individual differences, and... a dynamic model of individual development&quot;.

===Terminology===
The terminology of the MBTI has been criticized as being very &quot;vague and general&quot;, so as to allow any kind of behavior to fit any personality type, which may result in the Barnum effect, where people give a high rating to a positive description that supposedly applies specifically to them. Others argue that while the MBTI type descriptions are brief, they are also distinctive and precise. Some theorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions, providing even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey&#x27;s descriptions of his four temperaments, which he correlated with the 16 MBTI personality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use, intellectual orientation, educational and vocational interests, social orientation, self-image, personal values, social roles, and characteristic hand gestures.

===Factor analysis===
Researchers have reported that the JP and the SN scales correlate with one another. One factor-analytic study based on (N=1291) college-aged students found six different factors instead of the four purported dimensions, thereby raising doubts as to the construct validity of the MBTI.

===Correlates===
According to Hans Eysenck:
The main dimension in the MBTI is called E-I, or extraversion-introversion; this is mostly a sociability scale, correlating quite well with the MMPI social introversion scale (negatively) and the Eysenck Extraversion scale (positively). Unfortunately, the scale also has a loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end. Thus introversion correlates roughly (i.e., averaging values for males and females) −.44 with dominance, +.37 with abasement, +.46 with counselling readiness, −.52 with self-confidence, −.36 with personal adjustment, and −.45 with empathy. The failure of the scale to disentangle Introversion and Neuroticism (there is no scale for neurotic and other psychopathological attributes in the MBTI) is its worst feature, only equalled by the failure to use factor analysis in order to test the arrangement of items in the scale.
===Reliability===
The test-retest reliability of the MBTI tends to be low. Large numbers of people (between 39% and 76% of respondents) obtain different type classifications when retaking the indicator after only five weeks. In a 2013 &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; article titled &quot;Have we all been duped by the Myers-Briggs Test?&quot;, Roman Krznaric wrote:

Within each &quot;dichotomy&quot; scale, as measured on Form G, about 83% of categorizations remain the same when people are retested within nine months and around 75% when retested after nine months. About 50% of people re-administered the MBTI within nine months remain the same overall &quot;type&quot; and 36% the same type after more than nine months. For Form M (the most current form of the MBTI instrument), the MBTI &quot;Manual&quot; reports that these scores are higher.

In one study, when people were asked to compare their preferred type to that assigned by the MBTI assessment, only half of people chose the same profile.

Robert and Mary Capraro in 2002 meta-analysis published in the journal &quot;Educational and Psychological Measurement&quot; found out that &quot;In general, the MBTI and its scales yielded scores with strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates, although variation was observed.&quot; The analysis found that of 210 studies from 1998 to 2001, 14 (7%) reported directly on the reliability of the data, 26% reported reliability via prior studies or the test manual, and 56% did not mention reliability at all.

It has been argued that criticisms regarding the MBTI mostly come down to questions regarding the validity of its origins, not questions regarding the validity of the MBTI&#x27;s usefulness. Others argue that the MBTI can be a reliable measurement of personality, and &quot;like all measures, the MBTI yields scores that are dependent on sample characteristics and testing conditions&quot;.

==Statistics==
A 1973 study of university students in the United States found the INFP type was the most common type among students studying the fine arts and art education subjects, with 36% of fine arts students and 26% of art education students being INFPs. A 1973 study of the personality types of teachers in the United States found Intuitive-Perceptive types (ENFP, INFP, ENTP, INTP) were over-represented in teachers of subjects such as English, social studies and art, as opposed to science and mathematics, which featured more sensing (S) and judging (J) types. A questionnaire of 27,787 high school students suggested INFP students among them showed a significant preference for art, English, and music subjects.

==Utility==
Isabel Myers claimed that the proportion of different personality types varied by choice of career or course of study. However, researchers examining the proportions of each type within varying professions report that the proportion of MBTI types within each occupation is close to that within a random sample of the population. Some researchers have expressed reservations about the relevance of type to job satisfaction, as well as concerns about the potential misuse of the instrument in labeling people.

The Myers–Briggs Company, then known as Consulting Psychologists Press (and later CPP), became the exclusive publisher of the MBTI in 1975. They call it &quot;the world&#x27;s most widely used personality assessment&quot;, with as many as two million assessments administered annually. The Myers-Briggs Company and other proponents state that the indicator meets or exceeds the reliability of other psychological instruments.

The MBTI has poor predictive validity of employees&#x27; job performance ratings. As noted above under Precepts and ethics, the MBTI measures preferences, not ability. The use of the MBTI as a predictor of job success is expressly discouraged in the &quot;Manual&quot;. It is argued that the MBTI only continues to be popular because many people are qualified to administer it, it is not difficult to understand, and there are many supporting books, websites and other sources which are readily available to the general public.

==Correlations with other instruments==

===Keirsey temperaments===
David Keirsey developed the Keirsey Temperament Sorter after learning about the MBTI system, though he traces four &quot;temperaments&quot; back to Ancient Greek traditions. He maps these temperaments to the Myers–Briggs groupings SP, SJ, NF, and NT. He also gives each of the 16 MBTI types a name, as shown in the below table.

===Big Five===
McCrae and Costa based their Five Factor Model (FFM) on Goldberg&#x27;s Big Five theory. McCrae and Costa present correlations between the MBTI scales and the Big Five personality constructs measured, for example, by the NEO-PI-R. The five purported personality constructs have been labeled: extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism (emotional instability), although there is not universal agreement on the Big Five theory and the related Five-Factor Model (FFM). The following correlations are based on the results from 267 men and 201 women as part of a longitudinal study of aging.

These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively. These results suggest that the four MBTI scales can be incorporated within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, has addressed that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders.

These findings led McCrae and Costa to conclude that, &quot;correlational analyses showed that the four MBTI indices did measure aspects of four of the five major dimensions of normal personality. The five-factor model provides an alternative basis for interpreting MBTI findings within a broader, more commonly shared conceptual framework.&quot; However, &quot;there was no support for the view that the MBTI measures truly dichotomous preferences or qualitatively distinct types, instead, the instrument measures four relatively independent dimensions.&quot;

== Popularity ==

=== South Korea ===
At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, MBTI testing became a fad among young South Koreans who were using it in an attempt to find compatible dating partners. The fad originated with a website called 16Personalities.com, which offers a free approximation of the official paid test. Both independent experts and a representative of the MBTI publishing company have cautioned against using the MBTI test for dating, as the test was not designed for this purpose. South Korea experienced a similar trend in the early 2000s with the blood type personality theory.

One survey reported that by December 2021, nearly half of the population had taken the MBTI personality test. The MBTI personality test also became an issue in 2022 presidential election. In March 2022, &quot;Korea JoongAng Daily&quot; reported that &quot;A growing number of Korean companies are asking job candidates to reveal their MBTI personality test results, angering job hunters who argue that the test is an unreasonable standard to screen and evaluate their capabilities.&quot; A survey of South Korean job-seekers in their twenties found that 60% opposed the use of the test for such purposes.

=== China ===
16Personalities.com also influenced an MBTI fad in China, where some employers and job recruiters have asked applicants about their MBTI or 16Personalities results. The trend in China also led to MBTI-related products, paid services, and social media such as podcasts and memes.

==Misuse==

In 2021, director Tim Travers Hawkins&#x27;s film &quot;Persona: The Dark Truth Behind Personality Tests&quot; premiered on HBO. The company which owns the test condemns its misuse, writing the test &quot;is not, and was never intended to be predictive, and should never be used for hiring, screening or to dictate life decisions&quot;.

<text>Milk River is a tributary of the Missouri River, long, in the U.S. state of Montana and the Canadian province of Alberta. Rising in the Rocky Mountains, the river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of , ending just east of Fort Peck, Montana.

== Geography ==
It is formed in Glacier County in northwestern Montana, north of Browning, Montana, by the confluence of its South and Middle forks. The long South Fork and long Middle Fork both rise in the Rocky Mountains just east of Glacier National Park, in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Much of the water in the North Fork is diverted from the St. Mary River through a canal and inverted siphon.

The main stream flows east-northeast into southern Alberta, where it is joined by the North Fork of the Milk River, from there It flows past the town of Milk River and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, then turns southeast into Montana, running east along the north side of the Sweetgrass Hills, turning south, passing through the Fresno Dam, then east past Havre and along the north side of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Near Malta, it turns north, then southeast, flowing past Glasgow and joining the Missouri in Valley County, Montana, downstream from Fort Peck Dam. 

The watershed of the river extends into the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan and the US state of Montana. The watershed of the river covers an area of . Of this lies in Alberta, in Saskatchewan and the remaining in Montana. The area in Alberta and Saskatchewan is one of the few parts of the Mississippi River watershed that extends into Canada.

== History ==

The Milk River was given its name by Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who described the river in his journal:

This appearance results from clays and silts suspended in its waters. These fine-grained sediments result from the erosion of soft clay-rich rocks along the Milk River basin in southern Alberta, such as the Foremost, Oldman and Dinosaur Park formations.

At the time of Lewis&#x27;s exploration, the Milk River drainage was legally part of the United States as a component of the Louisiana Purchase. However, in 1818 U.S. negotiators swapped a portion of the Milk River watershed that lay north of 49° north latitude, receiving in exchange for a parcel of Red River of the North drainage that had previously been part of British North America.

The project to take water from St. Mary River into the north fork was authorized in 1905. It provides drinking water to 14,000 municipal users and irrigation to of ranchland along Montana’s Hi-Line region. In 1908, the waters of the Milk River were the subject of a United States Supreme Court case clarifying the water rights of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. This precedent setting ruling for Indian reservations is known as &quot;Winters v. United States&quot;.

==Habitat==
The Milk River area consists of three drainage basins – the Lost River Valley to the northeast, the Milk River in the middle, and the Kennedy Coulee to the southeast. The landscape consists of native grasslands, riparian cottonwood groves, badlands, coulees, cliffs, sand dunes, and rocky outcrops. Birds in the area include the mountain plover, burrowing owl, sage grouse, loggerhead shrike, Sprague&#x27;s pipit, long-billed curlew, ferruginous hawk, prairie falcon, willet, marbled godwit, lark bunting, Baird&#x27;s sparrow, McCown&#x27;s longspur, and the chestnut-collared longspur. The area also supports pronghorns, western hognose snakes, bull snakes, prairie rattlesnakes, and northern leopard frogs.

<text>Montana State University–Northern (MSU–Northern or Northern) is a public college in Havre, Montana, United States. It is part of the Montana University System and was Northern Montana College prior to the restructuring of Montana&#x27;s public university system in 1994.

==History==
In 1913, the Montana State Legislature approved the establishment of the Northern Montana Agricultural and Manual Training School at Fort Assinniboine, southwest of Havre, but no money was actually appropriated. The state legislature amended their original act in 1927 to include certain academic subjects and in 1929, the legislature appropriated funds to establish the college as a branch of the University of Montana (later renamed the Montana University System). Northern Montana College opened its doors in September 1929 in temporary quarters in Havre High School, and moved to its present campus in 1932.

==Athletics==
The Montana State–Northern athletic teams are called the Lights and Skylights. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Frontier Conference for most of its sports since the 1935–36 academic year; while its rodeo teams compete in the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA).

Montana State–Northern competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, rodeo and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, rodeo and volleyball.

<text>Zozobra (also known as Old Man Gloom and sometimes branded as Will Shuster&#x27;s Zozobra) is a giant marionette effigy constructed of wood, wire and cotton cloth that is built and burned on the Friday of Labor Day weekend prior to the annual Fiestas de Santa Fe in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States. It stands high.

== Burnt articles ==

The name is taken from the Spanish word zozobra referring to a strong feeling of anxiety or worries, and as its name suggests, the effigy embodies gloom and anxiety; by burning it, people destroy the worries and troubles of the previous year in the flames. Anyone with an excess of gloom is encouraged to write down the nature of their gloom on a slip of paper and leave it in the &quot;gloom box&quot; found in City of Santa Fe Visitors&#x27; Centers in the weeks leading up to the burn. Participants are also welcome to add their glooms at the annual ZozoFest, a festive precursor event that takes place the weekend before Zozobra burns. Those who attend the burning can also add documents at the venue on the day of the burning, up until 8 pm MT, at a &quot;gloom tent,&quot; where they can add their woes to the marionette&#x27;s stuffing. Legal papers, divorce documents, mortgage pay-offs, parking tickets, a Martin guitar and even a wedding dress –– have all found their way into Zozobra to go up in smoke. At the festival, glooms from the gloom box are placed inside Zozobra to be burned alongside it.

== History ==

Fiestas de Santa Fe has been held since 1712 to celebrate the Spanish reconquest of the city in 1692 by Don Diego de Vargas from the Pueblo tribes who had occupied the city since the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The burning of Zozobra dates from 1924, when artist William Howard Shuster, Jr. created and then burned the first Zozobra in his backyard at a party for his friends and fellow artists. &quot;Zozobra&quot; is a Spanish word for anxiety, worry, or sinking and was chosen by Shuster and newspaper editor E. Dana Johnson after a trip they made to Mexico. It is said that the idea was influenced by Mexican cartonería (papier-mâché sculpture), specifically the effigies exploded during the burning of Judas that takes place on Holy Saturday or New Year&#x27;s Eve, as a way of ridding oneself or one&#x27;s community of evil.

== Modern celebration ==

Each year in Santa Fe, New Mexico, over 60,000 people attend the event and hundreds of thousands watch online. The Labor Day Friday Burning of Zozobra is followed by a festive arts and crafts fair that launches the Santa Fe Fiesta over the Labor Day weekend. The following weekend welcomes the Santa Fe Fiesta Desfile de Los Niños, the Children&#x27;s Pet Parade, on Saturday, the Hysterical-Historical Parade on Sunday, and a traditional mass at St. Francis Cathedral.

Since receiving all rights to the Zozobra pageant in 1964 from creator Will Shuster, the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe has built Zozobra and burned the effigy at Fort Marcy Park. The Zozobra that burned on September 7, 2007, was certified by Guinness World Records as the largest marionette in the world, at the time measuring in height.

The Burning of Zozobra was traditionally held in September, however, attendance at the event improved in 2014 when it was moved to the Friday immediately before Labor Day.

=== Event description ===

Event gates open at 4 pm and live entertainment leads up to the official pageant that begins at 7 p.m., featuring live music, performances, a beachball toss and a performance of America&#x27;s national anthem. Lights-out music signals the start of the ritual tradition, and the annual drama begins in earnest. Zozobra begins to move, looking side to side and calling out his &quot;Gloomies.&quot; A group of youthful dancers symbolize the children of Santa Fe, whom Zozobra has converted into his minions by clouding their minds and robbing them of their hope and happiness. A group of torchbearers arrives, representing brave townsfolk who come to fight Zozobra&#x27;s dark intentions to destroy the city&#x27;s future. Zozobra&#x27;s force is great and his Gloomies frighten away the torchbearers, who drop their flaming torches and scatter. Zozobra and his Gloomies celebrate, but the watching crowd is energized and begins to chant &quot;burn him, burn him.&quot; Summoned by this urgent call for help, the Fire Spirit materializes, dressed in red with a headdress, symbolizing Old Man Gloom&#x27;s archenemy. and representing goodness and light called forth to destroy the gloom and bad energy of the year. The Fire Spirit chases away the Gloomies and dances in a battle with Zozobra, whose arms and head move as he growls and groans. Zozobra becomes incensed when the Fire Spirit takes up a pair of flaming torches to taunt him with the possibility of destruction. The struggle between light and darkness is finally consummated when the marionette is set alight by a series of internal fireworks and finally collapses, amidst a massive display of fireworks overhead, said to be creator Shuster&#x27;s way of painting the sky. As the last of Zozobra smolders in a pile of glowing embers, the watching crowd joyously celebrates the victory of light over darkness.

<text>Interstate 69 (I-69) is an Interstate Highway in the United States currently consisting of eight unconnected segments. The longest segment runs from Evansville, Indiana, northeast to the Canadian border in Port Huron, Michigan, and includes the original continuous segment from Indianapolis, Indiana, to Port Huron of . The remaining separated segments are variously completed and posted or not posted sections of an extension southwest to the Mexican border in Texas. Of this extension—nicknamed the NAFTA Superhighway because it would help trade with Canada and Mexico spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—seven pieces in Laredo, Texas; Pharr, Texas; Brownsville, Texas; Corpus Christi, Texas; Houston, Texas; northwestern Mississippi; and Memphis, Tennessee, have been built or upgraded and signposted as I-69. Indiana completed the fifth segment that extends I-69 through that state in August 2024.

A sixth segment of I-69 through Kentucky utilizing that state&#x27;s existing parkway system and a section of I-24 was established by federal legislation in 2008 with several more parkway segments being upgraded since then. This brings the total length to approximately .

The proposed extension evolved from the combination of Corridors 18 and 20 of the National Highway System as designated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), but the federally recognized corridor also includes connecting and existing infrastructure, including I-94 between Chicago, Illinois, and Port Huron, Michigan, and several spurs from I-69. Among these proposed spurs are an extension of I-530 from Pine Bluff, Arkansas; an upgrade of U.S. Route 59 (US 59) from Texarkana, Texas being designated as Interstate 369; and a split in southern Texas (I-69E, I-69C, I-69W) to serve three border crossings at Brownsville, Pharr, and Laredo.

In August 2007, I-69 was selected by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) as one of six Corridors of the Future, making it eligible for additional federal funding and streamlined planning and review. This funding has since been withheld, causing some states to suspend completion of the entire route until federal funding is restored. There is no estimated timeline for completion of the entire I-69 route.

==Route description==
I-69 currently exists as a number of distinct segments, mostly corresponding to defined sections of independent utility (SIUs):
* The original (with later additions), fully completed route from Evansville, Indiana, through Indianapolis along Interstate 465 to the Blue Water Bridge at Port Huron, Michigan (SIU 1-3);
* The upgraded portions of the Kentucky Parkway System: Purchase, Western Kentucky, and Pennyrile parkways; in addition to a portion of I-24 (SIU 5) and (SIU 6);

=== Texas ===

In Texas, I-69 currently begins in Rosenberg then passing through Greater Houston before currently ending in Cleveland, Texas. I-69, when completed, will be concurrent with US 59 from Victoria to Tenaha. Various portions of US 59 are being upgraded to prepare for the future alignment.

=== Mississippi ===

Another section of I-69 starts at an at-grade intersection with the route of Mississippi Highway 304 (MS 304) in Banks, Tunica County, Mississippi. It continues roughly north-northeast, crossing into DeSoto County to a partial interchange with the current route of MS 304, then runs easterly to an interchange with I-55 in northern Hernando. It then continues north, overlapping I-55 to the Tennessee state line, and continues northward concurrently with I-55 to the south side of Memphis. It then follows I-240 northward through downtown before joining I-40. Presently, the northern end of this section of I-69 is at the I-40/I-69/SR 300 interchange on the north side of Memphis. This portion of the route was the first SIU of the proposed extension to be signed as part of the national I-69 route, and the first portion designed as part of the extension.

=== Kentucky ===

In Kentucky, I-69 begins at the Tennessee border in Fulton on US 51 then follows the existing route of Purchase Parkway, I-24 (from exit 52 to 42), Western Kentucky Parkway, and Pennyrile Parkway before ending at US 41 just south of Henderson.

=== Indiana ===

The new section of I-69 in southern Indiana presently begins at the US 41 interchange south of Evansville at the former southern terminus of I-164. From there, it runs first east, then north, meeting SR 662, SR 66, and SR 62. At exit 18, SR 57 joins I-69 on a concurrency. Shortly thereafter, it meets I-64 at a cloverleaf interchange. From there, it runs north to SR 68. Construction was completed on November 19, 2012, on a segment (SIU 3, Sections 1–3). This extension takes the route north-northeast from there to SR 64 near Oakland City, then north-northeast to US 50/US 150 at Washington, and finally northeast to US 231 near Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division (NSWC Crane Division). Construction for the final new terrain segment (SIU 3, Section 4), which takes I-69 from NSWC Crane Division northeast to SR 37 on the southwest side of Bloomington, was completed in December 2015 and was extended north to Martinsville in late 2018 (Section 5). Section 6 (Martinsville to Indianapolis) of I-69&#x27;s SIU 3 is currently being upgraded to full Interstate Highway standards all the way north-northeast to I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis. The project is referred to as I-69 Finish Line Project. I-69 became a continuous segment in Indiana with the opening of the I-69/I-465 interchange on the south side of Indianapolis in August 2024.

The original portion of I-69 in Indiana (SIU 1 of the overall national plan) starts at an interchange with I-465, the beltway around Indianapolis on the northeast side of that city. I-69 heads northeast to near Anderson, where it turns more easterly to provide indirect access to Muncie before turning more northerly toward Marion and Fort Wayne. In Fort Wayne, I-69 runs along the western edge of the city while I-69&#x27;s first (and for many years only) signed auxiliary route, I-469, loops east of the city. After crossing the Indiana East–West Toll Road (I-80/I-90) near Angola and Fremont, I-69 enters Michigan just south of Kinderhook.

=== Michigan ===

I-69 in Michigan runs north passing through Coldwater and Marshall. There, it crosses I-94 east of Battle Creek. Near Olivet, I-69 begins to turn in a northeasterly direction, passing through the Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area. Here, I-69 is cosigned with I-96 as an overlap west of Lansing, the only such palindromic pairing in the Interstate Highway System. Where it splits from I-96, I-69 turns east, both in compass direction and in signed direction, and heads north of Lansing and through Flint (where it crosses I-75) to a junction with I-94 just outside Port Huron. At its eastern terminus, I-69 joins I-94 to the Blue Water Bridge across the St. Clair River, where traffic continues on Highway 402 in the Canadian province of Ontario to London, Ontario.

==History==

===Original route===

A route from I-465 in Indianapolis northeast via Fort Wayne to I-80/I-90 near Angola was added to the proposed &quot;Interregional Highway System&quot; by the early 1940s. Unlike most of the routes, it was not drawn along an existing U.S. Route corridor, except north of Fort Wayne (where it used US 27); most of it ran roughly parallel to SR 9 and SR 37. The extension beyond Angola to I-94 near Marshall, Michigan, actually started out as part of what evolved into I-94. On early plans, the Chicago–Detroit route would have replaced US 112 (now US 12), splitting from I-80/I-90 at South Bend. By 1947, the route had been shifted north to present I-94, along what was then US 12, but the connection to South Bend remained, splitting at Kalamazoo.

The I-69 designation was assigned to the Indianapolis–Angola route in 1957, while the short South Bend–Kalamazoo route became proposed I-67. The I-67 designation was shifted east to the US 27 corridor by early 1958, eventually being absorbed into the extension of I-69 to I-94 near Marshall which was built in 1967. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 authorized an additional of Interstates to be chosen by the FHWA; among Michigan&#x27;s proposals was a extension of I-69 northeast and east via US 27 to Lansing, M-78 to Flint, and M-21 to Port Huron. However, the FHWA initially only approved the route to I-475 in Flint. The continuation to Port Huron was eventually approved in February 1987. Michigan&#x27;s portion of the Interstate Highway System was completed in 1992, when the last piece of I-69 opened southwest of Lansing between I-96 and Charlotte.

===Extended route===

ISTEA included two High Priority Corridors that would later become parts of a proposed crosscountry extension of I-69:
* (18) Corridor from Indianapolis, to Memphis, Tennessee, via Evansville, Indiana.
* (20) US 59 Corridor from the Mexican border in Laredo, Texas, through Houston, to the vicinity of Texarkana, Texas.
Corridor 18 was extended southwest to Houston, where it connected to Corridor 20, by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993; the new definition read &quot;Corridor from Indianapolis, Indiana, through Evansville, Indiana, Memphis, Tennessee, Shreveport/Bossier, Louisiana, and to Houston, Texas.&quot; The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 made further amendments to the description of Corridor 18, specifying that it would serve Mississippi and Arkansas, extending it south to the Mexican border in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and adding a short connection at Brownsville, Texas. This act also specified that Corridors 18 and 20 were &quot;future parts of the Interstate System&quot; to become actual Interstates when built to Interstate Highway standards and connected to other Interstates. Although the act designated Corridor 9 as I-99, no number was assigned to Corridors 18 and 20 yet.

The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted in 1998, greatly expanded the definition of Corridor 18 to include the existing I-69, as well as I-94 between Port Huron, Michigan, and Chicago. A connection to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was added, and the extension to the Lower Rio Grande Valley was detailed as splitting into two routes just south of Victoria, one following US 77 and the other following US 59 and US 281 to the Rio Grande. This act also assigned the I-69 designation to Corridors 18 and 20, with the branches on US 77, US 281, and US 59 to the Rio Grande being &quot;Interstate 69 East&quot;, &quot;Interstate 69 Central&quot;, and &quot;Interstate 69 West&quot;, respectively. With TEA-21, the I-69 extension took shape and remains today as those segments.

In 2000, Corridors 18 and 20 were split into 32 SIUs as part of the I-69 (Corridor 18) Special Environmental Study. In Texas, it was originally envisioned that private firms will build, operate, then transfer portions of the highway to the state after a specified period of time. Lawmakers in Kentucky once considered a bill that would authorize the re-tolling of three parkways slated to become part of I-69.

====Opposition and controversy====
The construction of the I-69 extension beyond Indianapolis has angered environmentalists. In particular, the southern portion of the route in Indiana would run through wetlands, existing farmland, and forested areas, and cut through geologically sensitive karst topography, which environmentalists argue threatens to pollute underground water systems and harm the rare species that live there. Fiscal conservatives also oppose completion of I-69, arguing that federal legislation establishing the I-69 corridor amounts to an unfunded mandate imposed by the federal government upon the states through which the highway will travel, as the legislation requires states to pursue construction of their portions of I-69 but provides no funding mechanism to cover its estimated $25-billion cost, thereby leaving cash-strapped states to figure out how to finance its construction. Three states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee) have publicly stated they will not build their sections of I-69 until Congress appropriates funds to complete environmental studies, design, and construction in each state.

==Planned and delayed extensions==

===Past progress===

On June 6, 2008, President George W. Bush signed HR 1195, designating the Purchase Parkway as Future I-69. Kentucky officials planned to place I-69 signs on the Pennyrile Parkway, Western Kentucky Parkway, and Purchase Parkway in 2008, but the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had not yet given Kentucky approval to do so for the entire route. Kentucky was making spot improvements to its parkways to bring them up to Interstate Highway standards in anticipation of the I-69 designation.

Meanwhile, Indiana examined building most of SIU 3 as a toll road but quickly reverted to making it toll-free in 2006 with an announcement to that effect by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels after widespread opposition from I-69 opponents and supporters alike. Indiana had been using funds from the $3.8-billion Indiana Toll Road lease deal along with public–private partnerships to construct SIU 3 between Indianapolis and Evansville. The segment from Indianapolis to Evansville, Indiana, opened as of August 10, 2024.

===Progress delays===

While federal legislation established a mandate to extend I-69 from Indiana to Texas, it did not provide funding for its construction. I-69 construction must compete against other projects for traditional funding. Despite the approval of several segments, work has been completed on only a few scattered segments due in part to increasing costs for construction materials and machinery. As a result, several states have indicated that construction of I-69 may not be possible without the use of tolls as the primary means to finance building the highway. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi passed legislation authorizing toll roads within each state but have not applied tolling to their sections of I-69 due to the widespread unpopularity of toll roads in these states. A bridge over the Ohio River, which was to have been built along I-69 to connect Indiana with Kentucky, stalled in 2004 because each state did not have enough funding for it. In 2016, both states reached an agreement to restart environmental studies and develop a funding strategy for the Ohio River crossing; more funding has allowed for design and construction work to begin since that time. Tennessee has suspended work on I-69 indefinitely due to a lack of funding to build the highway outside of the Memphis metropolitan area. Arkansas has halted work on its mainline portion of I-69, aside from the Monticello Bypass, although it has applied for a federal grant to complete design and construction for the section between Monticello and McGehee. Phase 1 started construction in December 2022. , no portion of I-69 in Louisiana has been built nor has any construction started.

===Current progress and plans===
Texas, Kentucky, and Indiana have been slowly advancing construction of I-69 within each state through traditional funding sources when available and innovative financing methods, such as public–private partnerships. In December 2018, the I-69 River Crossing project team for Kentucky and Indiana announced a preferred plan to build a new toll bridge across the Ohio River as part of I-69. In January 2023, contracts were awarded for work on the Kentucky approach to the new bridge (section 1). In March 2023, Kentucky and Indiana signed an initial memorandum of agreement to allow preliminary development and financial planning to move forward. The Indiana approach (section 3) began construction in summer of 2024 with the widening and increasing of support for the inside shoulders to serve as temporary travel lanes on the final 1.5 mile stretch of I-69 eastward from its temporary end at the US 41 interchange. Construction of the bridge (section 2) is currently scheduled to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2031, although efforts to speed up the timeframe are being explored.

In 2021, Tennessee announced it was reviving construction of segment 7 of I-69 in northwestern Tennessee to link it to I-55 on the west side of the Mississippi River. This will provide an interim direct freeway link to Memphis that will bypass the suspended segment 8 pending its eventual completion to take I-69 even more directly into Memphis. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) halted the Interstate work about four years earlier because they lacked federal funding for the project. The revived portion of I-69 will run from the Kentucky state line to Dyersburg where it will connect with I-155, a spur that crosses the Mississippi River and extends to I-55 in southeastern Missouri. From there, I-55 extends south running parallel to the Mississippi River on the Missouri–Arkansas side then crosses the river into Memphis. A bypass around Union City, Tennessee has been completed to open to traffic on February 21, 2024.

===Texas===

In Texas, I-69 planning has become part of the Trans-Texas Corridor (TTC) studies. This part of the TTC, called I-69/TTC, includes I-69 and all of its spurs authorized by Congress. It will extend from three border crossings, at Laredo, Pharr, and Brownsville, along US 59, US 281, and US 77 toward Victoria. After the three branches join, I-69 will continue along the general US 59 corridor through Houston to Tenaha, where it will turn easterly to Louisiana along US 84. In Greater Houston, I-69 will follow the US 59 freeway corridor through town. A branch (I-369) continues north on US 59 from Tenaha to Texarkana, where it will eventually connect to I-30 and I-49. Most of the proposed I-69 route in Texas already exists as four-lane highways, with a lengthy freeway section stretching north and south of Houston along US 59 and shorter freeway sections of US 77, US 83, and US 281 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

The I-69/TTC project has been split into 15 SIUs, which match the original ones but do not share numbers. SIUs 1 to 8 (original 16 to 23) cover the mainline along the &quot;Interstate 69 East&quot; branch to the Mexican border at Brownsville. The &quot;Interstate 69 Central&quot; branch to Pharr is SIUs 9, 11, and 12 (original 24 to 26). The &quot;Interstate 369&quot; and &quot;Interstate 69 West&quot; branches to Texarkana and the Mexican border at Laredo, respectively, are SIUs 13 and 14 (original 29 and 30), and two connections to Brownsville and Pharr are SIUs 10 and 15 (original 31 and 32). The I-69/TTC study also includes SIU L-CC, a connection between Freer and Corpus Christi that was not in the 2000 study. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) originally considered building the I-69/TTC over new terrain paralleling US 59, US 77, and US 281.

Responding to widespread opposition from environmental groups and property rights activists, TxDOT announced in June 2008 that it will complete I-69 by upgrading the existing US 59, US 77, and US 281 roadways to Interstate standards through rural areas, with bypasses around urban centers along the route. Instead of building the Trans-Texas Corridor as originally planned, TxDOT now plans to finance upgrading the existing highways to I-69 through private sector investment. Under the proposed arrangement, I-69 would remain toll-free where it overlaps preexisting highways, while bypasses of cities may be tolled. The private firms awarded contracts for I-69 would also build and operate toll roads throughout the state; some of those revenues would then be applied to I-69 construction.

A stated goal of TxDOT&#x27;s I-69 initiative is that &quot;existing suitable freeway sections of the proposed system be designated as I-69 as soon as possible&quot;. In response to TxDOT&#x27;s request, a segment of US 77 between I-37 and SH 44 near Corpus Christi was approved for the &quot;I-69&quot; designation by the FHWA in August 2011 and was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in October 2011; signage was posted at an official ceremony on December 5, 2011; it was resigned as I-69E on May 29, 2013.

At the May 18, 2012, meeting of AASHTO, of US 59 from I-610 in Houston to Fostoria Road in Liberty County were also approved as ready for I-69 signage.

On May 29, 2013, the Texas Transportation Commission gave approval to naming completed Interstate-standard segments of US 77 and US 281 as I-69. US 77 through Cameron and Willacy counties will be signed as I-69E, including of existing freeway starting at the Rio Grande in Brownsville and running north past Raymondville. The of US 281 freeway in Pharr and Edinburg will be signed as I-69C.

The section of US 59 inside the I-610 loop that runs through Downtown Houston was approved by the FHWA for designation as I-69 on March 9, 2015, and approved for signage as such by the Texas Transportation Commission on March 24, 2015.

===Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi===

The nearly portion of the I-69 extension from south of Clarksdale, Mississippi, to the Louisiana–Texas state line is planned to be built as a new-terrain route that parallels existing U.S. Routes and state highways in some locations. As well as covering the part in Texas northeast of Nacogdoches, SIU 16 also extends into Louisiana, ending at US 171 near Stonewall. SIU 15 continues around the south and east sides of the Shreveport area, crossing I-49 and ending at I-20 near Haughton. SIU 14 extends northeast from I-20 to US 82 near El Dorado, Arkansas, and SIU 13 continues northeast to US 65 near McGehee, mainly paralleling US 278. Also included in Corridor 18, as SIU 28, is an extension of I-530 from Pine Bluff south along the US 425 corridor to I-69 west of Monticello; a short piece at the south end opened in mid-2006 as Highway 530 (AR 530). Another segment of AR 530 opened in 2013 and another in 2015. The only section of Future I-69 that is currently open to traffic is the eastern leg of the Monticello Bypass. This section of the Monticello Bypass is currently two lanes and signed as US Highway 278 Bypass (US 278 Byp.). Another two-lane segment to McGehee started construction in late 2022. The Charles W. Dean Bridge, SIU 12, is planned to cross the Mississippi River between McGehee, Arkansas, and Benoit, Mississippi, while SIU 11 will parallel US 61 to Tunica Resorts. SIU 10, the first completed portion of the I-69 extension, runs east from Tunica Resorts to I-55 near Hernando and opened in late 2006. With the record of decision signed in 2007, the FHWA authorized the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) to add I-69 signs on I-55 from the I-55/I-69 interchange in Hernando to the Tennessee state line.

===Tennessee, Kentucky, and Southern Indiana===
From a point south of Clarksdale, Mississippi, to Henderson, Kentucky, most of the I-69 alignment is planned to consist of upgrades to existing U.S. Highways, Interstates and substandard freeways, although some sections are expected be built as bypasses around cities and towns along the route.

I-69 SIU 9 overlaps I-55 into Memphis, Tennessee, switching there to I-240 and then I-40 before leaving onto the short SR 300 connection and then paralleling US 51 to near Millington. On January 18, 2008, the FHWA authorized TDOT to erect I-69 signs on I-55, I-240, and I-40 from the Mississippi state line to the I-40/SR 300 interchange. The recently completed I-269 will bypass this part of I-69, beginning where I-69 joins I-55 in Mississippi and ending near Millington, and will include the northern part of SR 385 near Millington. SIU 8 is planned to continue beyond Millington, near US 51, to I-155 near Dyersburg. Despite these plans, it is unclear if the entire I-69 project in Tennessee will ever be completed. The state has suspended work indefinitely on the SIU 8 and the remaining unbuilt portion of SIU 9 between SR 300 and the northern end of I-269 near Millington due to a lack of federal funding. Work on SIU 7 was also suspended for a few years, but this project has now been revived by the state which has decided there&#x27;s value in having a continuous chain of freeways running partly on other completed Interstates between Memphis and the Kentucky state line. SIU 7 follows the existing US 51 freeway with new bypasses to the state line at Fulton, Kentucky. Completion of this stretch of I-69 where it bypasses Union City opens to traffic temporarily signed as State Route 690 on February 21, 2024. A bypass for Troy is proposed as well. After that, Tennessee–Missouri–Arkansas I-55 link to I-155 which crosses back across the Mississippi River to the newly completed I-69 will serve as the main freeway routes between Memphis and northwestern Tennessee, at least on an interim basis.

In Kentucky, I-69 mostly follows existing freeways originally built as toll roads. SIU 6 follows the Julian M. Carroll Purchase Parkway and I-24 from Fulton to Eddyville, while SIU 5 continues along the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway and the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway from Eddyville to Henderson. While these parkways received the I-69 designation by federal legislation signed in 2008, upgrades have been necessary to bring the freeways to Interstate standards—but required less work compared to other states where entirely new highway must be built. A number of construction contracts have been let by the state of Kentucky to reconfigure several interchanges along the parkways. Many of these interchanges were originally designed with opposing loop ramps to accommodate toll barriers at the interchanges; these &quot;tollbooth&quot; style interchanges were (or will be) reconfigured to standard diamond interchanges as part of the parkways&#x27; conversion to I-69.

On August 31, 2011, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear announced an agreement between the state and the FHWA which allowed the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) to erect I-69 signage along the new Interstate&#x27;s overlap with I-24 and the stretch of the Western Kentucky Parkway between I-24 and the Pennyrile Parkway. Signage was placed in late 2011, with construction on necessary upgrades of the portion of the Western Kentucky Parkway expected to be bid in September. On October 25, 2011, I-69 was officially designated by Beshear along a stretch of I-24 and the Western Kentucky Parkway between Calvert City and Nortonville. Signage and milemarkers were replaced on the stretch of the Western Kentucky Parkway in mid-December 2012. An additional along the Pennyrile Parkway from the Western Kentucky Parkway to Kentucky Route 425 (KY 425), south of Henderson, was designated and resigned on November 16, 2015. The Purchase Parkway between Mayfield and Calvert City was signed in July 2018. The next phase of upgrading Purchase Parkway from Mayfield to the Tennessee state line began in December 2022 and was completed and opened on December 15, 2024.

A bridge spanning the Ohio River is the last remaining piece to connect the two states. The Indiana and Kentucky governors agreed on June 30, 2016, to spend a combined $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) for an environmental and design study to determine how the two states will pay for it. The first study was commissioned in 2001, and a preliminary report in 2004 put the cost of a bridge at $1.4 billion (equivalent to $ in ). In August 2023, officials in Kentucky and Indiana submitted a grant proposal to the U.S. Department of Transportation requesting $630 million to build. Construction began on I-69 ORX Section 1 in Kentucky in 2023. It includes numerous roadway and bridge improvements. Nine new bridges are being built and seven bridges are being rehabilitated as part of the new I-69 in Henderson. This section is scheduled for completion in 2025. Construction began on I-69 ORX Section 3 in Indiana in summer 2024 with the widening and strengthening of shoulders along I-69 east of its current end at US 41 to hold traffic during construction. ORX Section 2 is the actual construction of the bridge and it will be supported by toll revenue supplemented by traditional federal and state dollars. A financial plan was developed in 2021 and will be updated annually until construction is complete in 2029.

At the October 18, 2013, AASHTO meeting, an Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) request to redesignate I-164 as part of I-69 was approved, pending concurrence from the FHWA. I-69 was officially designated on this corridor in late 2014.

SIU 3, connecting I-69 to I-465 in southern Indianapolis, will roughly parallel SR 57 and SR 45 and will use an upgraded version of the existing SR 37 from just south of Bloomington to a point just south of Indianapolis. A stretch from Evansville to NSWC Crane Division was completed on November 19, 2012, and the remaining portion to Bloomington opened to traffic on December 9, 2015. Construction on upgrading a section of SR 37 from Bloomington to just south of Martinsville to Interstate standards was completed in late 2018. Construction began in 2019 on the final segment from Martinsville to Indianapolis, a project known as I-69 Finish Line, with completion anticipated by the end of 2024. SIU 2 will follow the southeastern quarter of I-465 around the city. The interchange between I-69 and I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis opened on August 6 and 9, 2024, making I-69 through Indiana continuous.

<text>Interstate 71 (I-71) is a north–south Interstate Highway in the midwestern and southeastern regions of the United States. Its southern terminus is at an interchange with I-64 and I-65 (the Kennedy Interchange) in Louisville, Kentucky, and its northern terminus at an interchange with I-90 in Cleveland, Ohio. I-71 runs concurrently with I-75 from a point about south of Cincinnati, Ohio, into Downtown Cincinnati. While most odd numbered Interstates run north–south, I-71 takes more of a northeast–southwest course, with some east–west sections, and is mainly a regional route serving Kentucky and Ohio. It links I-80 and I-90 to I-70 and ultimately (via I-65) links to I-40. Major metropolitan areas served by I-71 include Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland.

Approximately three-quarters of the route lie east of I-75, leaving I-71 out of place in the Interstate grid.

===Kentucky===


In Kentucky, I-71 begins east of Downtown Louisville at the Kennedy Interchange, where it meets I-64 and I-65. This interchange is sometimes called the &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;. From Louisville, it roughly follows the Ohio River in a diagonal path toward Northern Kentucky. Between Louisville and Cincinnati, I-71 is largely a four-lane highway, except for the approach to Kentucky Speedway in Sparta in which it runs three lanes each way for about .

Near the town of Carrollton, there are signs marking the location of a tragic accident that occurred on May 14, 1988, when a drunk driver was driving north in the southbound lanes and struck a church bus full of children and teenagers, causing the bus&#x27;s fuel tank to ignite into flames and killing 27 people on board. It is one of the worst bus accidents in state and national history.

After having run from Louisville, I-71 merges with I-75 near Walton after which it intersects I-275, the Cincinnati beltway. After passing through Covington, the freeway crosses the Ohio River via the lower level of the Brent Spence Bridge (while the southbound direction uses the upper level) and continues into Cincinnati.

===Ohio===
In Cincinnati, it splits immediately from I-75 and heads due east onto Fort Washington Way, where it continues through Downtown Cincinnati concurrently with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) for less than . Just east of downtown, US 50 splits from I-71 and continues east; I-71 bends north and receives I-471, a spur from southeast of the city. I-71 then heads in a general northeast direction through the Lytle Tunnel and urban Cincinnati and into its surrounding suburbs. After another interchange with the I-275 beltway, the freeway leaves the metropolitan area and heads toward Columbus. It continues northeast until it reaches South Lebanon, where it begins cutting east across the flat plains of southwest Ohio. The freeway crosses the Little Miami River on the Jeremiah Morrow Bridge, which is a continuous truss bridge and the tallest bridge in Ohio, at above the river. I-71 heads toward Columbus then intersects with the bypass I-270 before heading north into urban Columbus, where it junctions I-70. About north of the I-70 junction, it intersects with I-670. After another interchange with the I-270 bypass, the highway exits Columbus and continues north until near Delaware, where it again turns northeast. Beginning its path to Cleveland, I-71 enters the rolling farm country on the edges of the Allegheny Plateau. It continues in this fashion to Lodi–Westfield Center and its junction with I-76, which provides access to Akron and points east. Heading north to Medina, it meets the terminus of I-271. The highway then continues north into urban Cuyahoga County and Cleveland&#x27;s suburbs, intersecting the Ohio Turnpike/I-80. Passing Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, I-71 meets I-480 and enters Cleveland&#x27;s west side, continuing on to downtown. It junctions with State Route 176 (SR 176) and terminates at I-90 on the Innerbelt.

==History==

===Kentucky===
The first section of I-71 in Louisville opened in December 1966 between its terminus at Spaghetti Junction and Zorn Avenue, its first exit. Its junction with I-264 opened in July 1968, and the complete Kentucky portion of the Interstate was opened to the public in July 1969. At that point, it replaced US 42 as the primary link between Cincinnati and Louisville.

===Ohio===

Much of I-71 in Ohio was intended to be SR 1. SR 1 was originally planned in the 1950s as a second Ohio Turnpike extending southwest to northeast across the state. It was planned to run from Cincinnati to Conneaut and connect with an extension built across the panhandle of Pennsylvania to the New York State Thruway. As the highway was being planned, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was enacted, and the project was converted from a toll road to a freeway. It was designated as SR 1, since the Interstate Highway numbering system had not yet been implemented. Portions of the freeway began to be completed and opened in 1959 with the new Interstate Highway funding, and they were marked as SR 1 as well as with their new Interstate Highway number. Since large gaps existed along the corridor where no freeway had yet been completed, existing two-lane or four-lane highways were also designated as SR 1 in order to complete the route. The SR 1 signage was removed in 1966 as the Interstate Highway numbers adequately marked the route by then and the state highway numbering was superfluous.
In Columbus, the portion of I-71 that bounds Worthington&#x27;s eastern edge was originally called the North Freeway. Costing $13.8 million (equivalent to $ in ), it was constructed south from SR 161, arriving at 11th Avenue by August 1961. It took another year to construct the portion between 11th and 5th avenues, mainly due to the need to construct a massive underpass under the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Grogan Yard. Today, only two tracks cross the viaduct, and the rest of the structure supports a large, weedy field. By August 1962, the freeway had reached Fifth Avenue, and it reached downtown in November 1962.

I-71 was originally planned to follow the Innerbelt Freeway northward from its current northern terminus to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway at Dead Man&#x27;s Curve when I-90 was planned to continue westward from there along the Shoreway.

Upon its completion, I-71 replaced SR 3 as the primary highway link between Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland.

Between 2004 and 2006, the interchange at milepost 121 in the far northern reaches of Columbus was reconstructed to allow access to the eastern extension of Gemini Place. Before that, it was a simple diamond interchange with SR 750 (Polaris Parkway).

===Rebuilding and widening program===
In 1999, the state of Ohio began a 10-year, $500-million (equivalent to $ in ) project to improve I-71 between Columbus and Cleveland. The plans did not include widening the stretch in Delaware and Morrow counties, calling for patching that section instead. At that time, state transportation officials said they did not plan to widen that section for two reasons: traffic studies did not support the widening and there was no money for the project. But Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) officials eventually gave in under pressure from elected officials and business owners to widen the remaining stretch of I-71 from just north of the US 36/SR 37 interchange in Delaware County to the Morrow–Richland county line. The reconstruction and widening on the last stretch of I-71 in Delaware and Morrow counties began in early 2012, and the work was completed in mid-2015 at a cost of $144 million (equivalent to $ in ).

==Exit list==














































==Auxiliary routes==
I-71 has two auxiliary routes in Greater Cleveland and the Cincinnati metropolitan area. I-471 links Downtown Cincinnati with I-275. I-271 provides access to Cleveland&#x27;s eastern suburbs and enables travelers on I-71 to access I-90 east without going through Cleveland proper.

<text>Interstate 72 (I-72) is an Interstate Highway in the Midwestern United States. Its western terminus is in Hannibal, Missouri, at an intersection with U.S. Route 61 (US 61); its eastern terminus is at Country Fair Drive in Champaign, Illinois. The route runs through the major cities of Decatur, Illinois, and Springfield, Illinois. In 2006, the Illinois General Assembly dedicated all of I-72 as Purple Heart Memorial Highway. The stretch between Springfield and Decatur is also called Penny Severns Memorial Expressway, and the section between mile 35 and the Mississippi River is known as the Free Frank McWorter Historic Highway.

===Missouri===
I-72 runs for just over in the state of Missouri. Its western terminus is an interchange with US 61 to the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River. This bridge connects the city of Hannibal with Illinois. Presently, there are only two exits for I-72 in Missouri.

===Illinois===
I-72 parallels the old Wabash Railroad from Hannibal, east through Illinois to Champaign, Illinois. The Norfolk Southern Railway operates this railroad route today.

In Illinois, I-72 runs for . The portion of I-72 and I-172 from Springfield to Quincy is commonly referred to as the Central Illinois Expressway (CIE). , I-72 has one business route; I-72 Business (I-72 Bus.) in Jacksonville.

Near Valley City at mile-marker 42 are the Valley City Eagle Bridges. These two individual two-lane spans bridge the Illinois River in rural west-central Illinois. Near milemarker 78, a sign marks 90 degrees longitude.

At its eastern terminus in Champaign, I-72 continues as Church Street (westbound) and University Avenue (eastbound), which stay as one-way streets for an additional into downtown Champaign.

First constructed in 1971, I-72 ran from Springfield at I-55 to Champaign at I-57 until the 1990s. On June 9, 1991, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the establishment of I-172 from the western terminus of I-72 at Springfield to Fall Creek, east of Hannibal, Missouri, though it was contingent on Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approval. The FHWA preferred to designate the route I-72.

After discussions regarding extending an Interstate Highway through the state of Missouri, on April 22, 1995, AASHTO approved another renumbering. I-172 was renumbered in its entirety as I-72. The US 36 extension west of Fall Creek was also given the I-72 designation. The Illinois Route 336 (IL 336) expressway was renumbered to I-172 from Fall Creek to Fowler.

Prior to September 2000, Mark Twain Avenue (old US 36) was composed of the current Mark Twain Avenue (now Route 79) and the portion of I-72 and US 36 west of exit 157 to the Hannibal city limits. Route 79 terminated at the foot of the old Mark Twain Memorial Bridge at the corner of Third Street and Mark Twain Avenue. Signs along the four-lane expressway portion of Mark Twain Avenue marked the route as &quot;Future I-72&quot;, while signs along what is now Route 79 had I-72 trailblazers to direct drivers to the temporary terminus at Fall Creek, Illinois. When the new Mark Twain Memorial Bridge was completed in September 2000, I-72 was routed over the new bridge, along with US 36. Route 79 was extended along Mark Twain Avenue to terminate at exit 157. 

===Chicago–Kansas City Expressway===
The concept of I-72 across Missouri was to create the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway, a rural four-lane highway across northern Missouri and west central Illinois from Cameron, Missouri, at I-35 to Springfield, Illinois, at I-55. This would provide a series of rural four-lane highways (I-35, US 36, I-72, and I-55) connecting Chicago to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Corridor (High Priority Corridor 23). This would reduce the amount of through traffic, primarily truck traffic, in the St. Louis, Des Moines, and Quad Cities metropolitan areas by serving as an alternate route for I-70 and I-80. The Missouri portion of this route is designated as part of High Priority Corridor 61.

Based on the marker at Route 79, if/when US 36 is upgraded to Interstate standards across Missouri, the future western terminus of I-72 would be at Cameron at the intersection with I-35. Currently, the west end of I-72 route is west of US 61 and flows concurrent with US 36 into Illinois. In 2004, US 36 was upgraded to a four-lane expressway between US 61 and US 24 at the Rocket Junction (). There are three exits along this expressway: Veterans Road, Shinn Lane (Hannibal Regional Hospital), and US 24 east at the Rocket Junction. Also, an interchange with Route 15 was installed in Shelbina.

Due to funding priorities, upgrading US 36 between Macon and Hannibal was a low-priority project and was shelved. The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) committed to constructing the four-lane highway as an at-grade expressway only if the five counties served by US 36 east of Macon would contribute half of the $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) cost. Road construction to complete the between Hannibal and Macon began in 2007. In August 2010, the four-lane expressway was completed from Macon to Hannibal, completing Missouri&#x27;s portion of the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway.

== Future ==
Plans exist to extend I-72 westward from its current terminus in Hannibal to St. Joseph, Missouri along the existing US 36, but the proposal was shelved for years despite most of the route being a part of the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway. In May 2023, Missouri lawmakers approved a $2.5 million study on the conversion of US 36 into I-72. The extension of I-72 is seen as a way to relieve the pressure off of I-70 as well as reduce truck traffic in St. Louis. However, in July 2023, the bill was vetoed by Governor Mike Parson who said that it was not the right time to run the study. The extension to I-29 is listed under High Priority Corridor 61B, although part of it was for the CKC and not I-72.

Interstate 72 Business (I-72) is a business loop of I-72 in Jacksonville. It runs from the I-72/US 36/US 67 interchange southwest of Jacksonville north along the US 67 bypass of Jacksonville to the former alignment of US 36 (Morton Avenue). On Morton Avenue, I-72 Bus. runs east through downtown Jacksonville until it reaches I-72 at exit 68. This is a distance of .

<doc id="93585" wikidata="Q310048" url="?curid=93585" title="Don DeLillo">
<text>Donald Richard DeLillo (born November 20, 1936) is an American novelist, short story writer, playwright, screenwriter, and essayist. His works have covered subjects as diverse as consumerism, nuclear war, the complexities of language, art, television, the advent of the Digital Age, mathematics, politics, economics, and sports.

DeLillo was already a well-regarded cult writer in 1985, when the publication of &quot;White Noise&quot; brought him widespread recognition and the National Book Award for fiction. He followed this in 1988 with &quot;Libra&quot;, a novel about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. DeLillo won the PEN/Faulkner Award for &quot;Mao II&quot;, about terrorism and the media&#x27;s scrutiny of writers&#x27; private lives, and the William Dean Howells Medal for &quot;Underworld&quot;, a historical novel that ranges in time from the dawn of the Cold War to the birth of the Internet. He was awarded the 1999 Jerusalem Prize, the 2010 PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction, and the 2013 Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.

DeLillo has described his themes as &quot;living in dangerous times&quot; and &quot;the inner life of the culture&quot;. In a 2005 interview, he said that writers &quot;must oppose systems. It&#x27;s important to write against power, corporations, the state, and the whole system of consumption and of debilitating entertainments... I think writers, by nature, must oppose things, oppose whatever power tries to impose on us.&quot;

==Early life and influences==
DeLillo was born on November 20, 1936, in New York City and grew up in a Catholic family, with ties to Molise, Italy, in an Italian-American neighborhood of the Bronx not far from Arthur Avenue. Reflecting on his childhood in the Bronx, DeLillo said he was &quot;always out in the street. As a little boy I whiled away most of my time pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio. I could think up games for hours at a time. There were eleven of us in a small house, but the close quarters were never a problem. I didn&#x27;t know things any other way. We always spoke English and Italian all mixed up together. My grandmother, who lived in America for fifty years, never learned English.&quot;

As a teenager, DeLillo was not interested in writing until he took a summer job as a parking attendant, where the hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a lifelong reading habit. Reflecting on this period, in a 2010 interview, he stated, &quot;I had a personal golden age of reading in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time&quot;. Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo&#x27;s earliest attempts at writing in his late teens.

As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music—&quot;guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis&quot;—and postwar cinema: &quot;Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the &#x27;70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don&#x27;t know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense.&quot; Of the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, &quot;European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn&#x27;t have much money, didn&#x27;t have much work, I was living in one room...I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn&#x27;t go to the cinema, and I didn&#x27;t think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer.&quot; He also credits his parents&#x27; leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: &quot;They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I&#x27;d chosen. This is something that happens if you&#x27;re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case.&quot;

After graduating from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1954 and from Fordham University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communication arts in 1958, DeLillo took a job in advertising because he could not get one in publishing. He worked for five years as a copywriter at Ogilvy &amp; Mather on Fifth Avenue, writing image ads for Sears Roebuck among others, working on &quot;Print ads, very undistinguished accounts...I hadn&#x27;t made the leap to television. I was just getting good at it when I left, in 1964.&quot;

DeLillo published his first short story in 1960—&quot;The River Jordan&quot;, in &quot;Epoch&quot;, Cornell University&#x27;s literary magazine—and began to work on his first novel in 1966. Of the beginning of his writing career, DeLillo has said, &quot;I did some short stories at that time but very infrequently. I quit my job just to quit. I didn&#x27;t quit my job to write fiction. I just didn&#x27;t want to work anymore.&quot;
Reflecting in 1993 on his relatively late start in writing novels, DeLillo said, &quot;I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn&#x27;t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I may have had novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end. Second, I didn&#x27;t have a sense of what it takes to be a serious writer. It took me a long time to develop this.&quot; He cites William Gaddis&#x27;s &quot;The Recognitions&quot; as a formative influence: &quot;It was a revelation, a piece of writing with the beauty and texture of a Shakespearean monologue-or, maybe more apt, a work of Renaissance art impossibly transformed from image into words. And they were the words of a contemporary American. This, to me, was the wonder of it.&quot;

==Works==

===1970s===
DeLillo&#x27;s inaugural decade of novel writing has been his most productive to date, resulting in the writing and publication of six novels between 1971 and 1978.

DeLillo resigned from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens–Midtown Tunnel (&quot;It wasn&#x27;t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy&quot;), and began work on his first novel. Of the early days of his writing career, he remarked: &quot;I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time.&quot; His first novel, &quot;Americana&quot;, was written over four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. It concerned &quot;a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture&quot;.

DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback reprinting. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don&#x27;t think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published.&quot; Later still, DeLillo continued to feel a degree of surprise that &quot;Americana&quot; was published: &quot;I was working on my first novel, &quot;Americana&quot;, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn&#x27;t know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn&#x27;t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn&#x27;t have a representative. I didn&#x27;t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing.&quot;

&quot;Americana&quot; was followed in rapid succession by the American college football/nuclear war black comedy &quot;End Zone&quot; (1972)—written under the working titles &quot;The Self-Erasing Word&quot; and &quot;Modes of Disaster Technology&quot;—and the rock and roll satire &quot;Great Jones Street&quot; (1973), which DeLillo later felt was &quot;one of the books I wish I&#x27;d done differently. It should be tighter, and probably a little funnier.&quot; He married Barbara Bennett, a former banker turned landscape designer, in 1975.

DeLillo&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Ratner&#x27;s Star&quot; (1976)—which according to DeLillo is &quot;structure[d] [...] on the writings of Lewis Carroll, in particular &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;—took two years to write and drew numerous favorable comparisons to the works of Thomas Pynchon. This &quot;conceptual monster&quot;, as DeLillo scholar Tom LeClair has called it, is &quot;the picaresque story of a 14-year-old math genius who joins an international consortium of mad scientists decoding an alien message.&quot; DeLillo has said it was both one of the most difficult books for him to write and his personal favorite.

Following this early attempt at a major long novel, DeLillo ended the decade with two shorter works. &quot;Players&quot; (1977), originally conceived as &quot;based on what could be called the intimacy of language—what people who live together really sound like&quot;, concerned the lives of a young yuppie couple as the husband gets involved with a cell of domestic terrorists. Its 1978 successor, &quot;Running Dog&quot; (1978), written in four months, was a thriller about a hunt for a celluloid reel of Hitler&#x27;s sexual exploits.

Of &quot;Running Dog&quot;, DeLillo remarked, &quot;What I was really getting at in &quot;Running Dog&quot; was a sense of the terrible acquisitiveness in which we live coupled with a final indifference to the object. After all the mad attempts to acquire the thing, everyone suddenly decides that, well, maybe we really don&#x27;t care about this so much anyway. This was something I felt characterized our lives at the time the book was written in the mid to late seventies. I think this was part of American consciousness then.&quot;

In 1978, DeLillo was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship, which he used to fund a trip around the Middle East before settling in Greece, where he wrote his next novels, &quot;Amazons&quot; and &quot;The Names&quot;.

Of his first six novels and his rapid writing turnover later in his career, DeLillo said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t learning to slow down and examine what I was doing more closely. I don&#x27;t have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it, I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at &quot;Ratner&#x27;s Star&quot; (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and &#x27;90s.&quot; DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: &quot;I knew I wasn&#x27;t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way.&quot;

===1980s===
The beginning of the 1980s saw the most unusual and uncharacteristic publication in DeLillo&#x27;s career. The sports novel &quot;Amazons&quot;, a mock memoir of the first woman to play in the National Hockey League, is a far more lighthearted novel than his previous others. DeLillo published the novel under the pseudonym Cleo Birdwell, and later requested publishers compiling a bibliography for a reprint of a later novel to expunge the novel from their lists.

While DeLillo was living in Greece, he took three years to write &quot;The Names&quot; (1982), a complex thriller about &quot;a risk analyst who crosses paths with a cult of assassins in the Middle East&quot;. While lauded by an increasing number of critics, DeLillo was still relatively unknown outside small academic circles and did not reach a wide readership with this novel. Also in 1982, DeLillo finally broke his self-imposed ban on media coverage by giving his first major interview to Tom LeClair, who had first tracked DeLillo down for an interview while he was in Greece in 1979. On that occasion, DeLillo handed LeClair a business card with his name printed on it and beneath that the message &quot;I don&#x27;t want to talk about it.&quot;

With the 1985 publication of his eighth novel, &quot;White Noise&quot;, DeLillo rapidly became a noted and respected novelist. &quot;White Noise&quot; was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place in the canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the award, he simply said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t be here tonight, but I thank you all for coming,&quot; and then sat down.

&quot;White Noise&quot;&#x27;s influence can be seen in the writing of David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were &quot;All Souls&quot;, &quot;Ultrasonic&quot;, &quot;The American Book of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Psychic Data&quot; and &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. In 2005 DeLillo said &quot;White Noise&quot; was a fine choice, adding, &quot;Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph.&quot;

DeLillo followed &quot;White Noise&quot; with &quot;Libra&quot; (1988), a speculative fictionalized life of Lee Harvey Oswald up to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. DeLillo undertook a vast research project, which included reading at least half of the Warren Commission report (which DeLillo called &quot;the Oxford English Dictionary of the assassination and also the Joycean novel. This is the one document that captures the full richness and madness and meaning of the event, despite the fact that it omits about a ton and a half of material.&quot;) Written with the working titles &quot;American Blood&quot; and &quot;Texas School Book&quot;, &quot;Libra&quot; became an international bestseller, one of five finalists for the National Book Award, and the winner of the next year&#x27;s &quot;Irish Times&quot; Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize.

The novel also elicited fierce critical division, with some critics praising DeLillo&#x27;s take on the Kennedy assassination while others decried it. George Will, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, declared the book an affront to America and &quot;an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship&quot;. DeLillo responded &quot;I don&#x27;t take it seriously, but being called a &#x27;bad citizen&#x27; is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That&#x27;s exactly what we ought to do. We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, in the sense that we&#x27;re writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we&#x27;re bad citizens, we&#x27;re doing our job.&quot; In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will&#x27;s claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo has frequently reflected on the significance of the Kennedy assassination to not only his own work but American culture and history as a whole, remarking in 2005, &quot;November 22nd, 1963, marked the real beginning of the 1960s. It was the beginning of a series of catastrophes: political assassinations, the war in Vietnam, the denial of Civil Rights and the revolts that occasioned, youth revolt in American cities, right up to Watergate. When I was starting out as a writer it seemed to me that a large part of the material you could find in my novels—this sense of fatality, of widespread suspicion, of mistrust—came from the assassination of JFK.&quot;

===1990s===
DeLillo&#x27;s concerns about the position of the novelist and the novel in a media- and terrorist-dominated society were made clear in his next novel, &quot;Mao II&quot; (1991). Influenced by the events surrounding the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie and the intrusion of the press into the life of J. D. Salinger, &quot;Mao II&quot; earned DeLillo significant critical praise from, among others, John Banville and Thomas Pynchon. It won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1992.

Following &quot;Mao II&quot;, DeLillo went underground and spent several years writing and researching his 11th novel. In 1992, he published the folio short story &quot;Pafko at the Wall&quot; in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The piece recounts Bobby Thomson&#x27;s Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World from the perspective of various witnesses, real and fictional. He told &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Sometime in late 1991, I started writing something new and didn&#x27;t know what it would be – a novel, a short story, a long story. It was simply a piece of writing, and it gave me more pleasure than any other writing I&#x27;ve done. It turned into a novella, &quot;Pafko at the Wall&quot;, and it appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; about a year after I started it. At some point I decided I wasn&#x27;t finished with the piece. I was sending signals into space and getting echoes back, like a dolphin or a bat. So the piece, slightly altered, is now the prologue to a novel-in-progress, which will have a different title. And the pleasure has long since faded into the slogging reality of the no man&#x27;s land of the long novel. But I&#x27;m still hearing the echoes.&quot;

This would become the prologue of his epic Cold War history &quot;Underworld&quot;. DeLillo took inspiration from the October 4, 1951, front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which juxtaposed Thomson&#x27;s home-run alongside the news that the Soviet Union had tested a hydrogen bomb. The book was widely heralded as a masterpiece, with novelist and critic Martin Amis saying it marked &quot;the ascension of a great writer.&quot; Harold Bloom called it &quot;the culmination of what Don can do.&quot;

&quot;Underworld&quot; went on to become one of DeLillo&#x27;s most acclaimed novels to date, achieving mainstream success and earning nominations for the National Book Award and &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Books of the Year in 1997, and a second Pulitzer Prize for Fiction nomination in 1998. The novel won the 1998 American Book Award and the William Dean Howells Medal in 2000.

DeLillo later expressed surprise at &quot;Underworld&quot;&#x27;s success. In 2007, he remarked: &quot;When I finished with &quot;Underworld&quot;, I didn&#x27;t really have any all-too-great hopes, to be honest. It&#x27;s some pretty complicated stuff: 800 pages, more than 100 different characters—who&#x27;s going to be interested in that?&quot; After rereading it in 2010, over ten years after its publication, DeLillo said that rereading it &quot;made me wonder whether I would be capable of that kind of writing now—the range and scope of it. There are certain parts of the book where the exuberance, the extravagance, I don&#x27;t know, the overindulgence...There are city scenes in New York that seem to transcend reality in a certain way.&quot;

===2000s===
Although they have received some acclaim in places, DeLillo&#x27;s post-&quot;Underworld&quot; novels have been often viewed by critics as &quot;disappointing and slight, especially when held up against his earlier, big-canvas epics&quot;, marking a shift &quot;away from sweeping, era-defining novels&quot; such as &quot;White Noise&quot;, &quot;Libra&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot; to a more &quot;spare and oblique&quot; style, characterized by &quot;decreased length, the decommissioning of plot machinery and the steep deceleration of narrative time&quot;.

DeLillo has said of this shift to shorter novels, &quot;If a longer novel announces itself, I&#x27;ll write it. A novel creates its own structure and develops its own terms. I tend to follow. And I never try to stretch what I sense is a compact book.&quot; In a March 2010 interview, it was reported that DeLillo&#x27;s deliberate stylistic shift had been informed by his having recently reread several slim but seminal European novels, including Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Peter Handke&#x27;s &quot;The Goalie&#x27;s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick&quot;, and Max Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot;.

After the publication and extensive publicity drive for &quot;Underworld&quot;, DeLillo once again retreated from the spotlight to write his 12th novel, surfacing with &quot;The Body Artist&quot; in 2001. The novel has many established DeLillo preoccupations, particularly its interest in performance art and domestic privacies in relation to the wider scope of events. But it is very different in style and tone from the epic history of &quot;Underworld&quot;, and met with mixed critical reception.

DeLillo followed &quot;The Body Artist&quot; with 2003&#x27;s &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;, a modern reinterpretation of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; transposed to New York around the time of the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000. The novel was met at the time with a largely negative reception from critics, with several high-profile critics and novelists—notably John Updike—voicing their objections to its style and tone.

When asked in 2005 how he felt about the novel&#x27;s mixed reception compared to the broader positive consensus afforded to &quot;Underworld&quot;, DeLillo remarked: &quot;I try to stay detached from that aspect of my work as a writer. I didn&#x27;t read any reviews or articles. Maybe it [the negative reception] was connected to September 11. I&#x27;d almost finished writing the book when the attacks took place, and so they couldn&#x27;t have had any influence on the book&#x27;s conception, nor on its writing. Perhaps for certain readers this upset their expectations.&quot; Critical opinions have since been revised, the novel latterly being seen as prescient for its focus on the flaws and weaknesses of the international financial system and cybercapital.

DeLillo&#x27;s papers were acquired in 2004 by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, reputedly for &quot;half a million dollars&quot;. There are &quot;[one] hundred and twenty-five boxes&quot; of DeLillo materials, including various drafts and correspondence. Of his decision to donate his papers to the Ransom Center, DeLillo has said: &quot;I ran out of space and also felt, as one does at a certain age, that I was running out of time. I didn&#x27;t want to leave behind an enormous mess of papers for family members to deal with. Of course, I&#x27;ve since produced more paper—novel, play, essay, etc.—and so the cycle begins again.&quot;

DeLillo published his final novel of the decade, &quot;Falling Man&quot;, in 2007. The novel concerns the impact on one family of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, &quot;an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event&quot;. DeLillo said he originally &quot;didn&#x27;t ever want to write a novel about 9/11&quot; and &quot;had an idea for a different book&quot; he had &quot;been working on for half a year&quot; in 2004 when he came up with the idea for the novel, beginning work on it following the reelection of George W. Bush that November.

Although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics, who felt that DeLillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of 9/11 in novelistic form, the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations. DeLillo remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim, remarking in 2010, &quot;In the 1970s, when I started writing novels, I was a figure in the margins, and that&#x27;s where I belonged. If I&#x27;m headed back that way, that&#x27;s fine with me because that&#x27;s always where I felt I belonged. Things changed for me in the 1980s and 1990s, but I&#x27;ve always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room, observing.&quot;

On July 24, 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; announced that David Cronenberg would adapt &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; for the screen, with &quot;a view to eventually direct.&quot; &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;, eventually released in 2012, became the first direct adaptation for the screen of a DeLillo novel, although both &quot;Libra&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot; had previously been optioned for screen treatments. There were discussions about adapting &quot;End Zone&quot;, and DeLillo has written an original screenplay for the film &quot;Game 6&quot;.

DeLillo ended the decade by making an unexpected appearance at a PEN event on the steps of the New York Public Library in support of Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot;inciting subversion of state power&quot; on December 31, 2009.

===2010s===

DeLillo published &quot;Point Omega&quot;, his 15th novel, in February 2010. According to DeLillo, the novel considers an idea from &quot;the writing of the Jesuit thinker and paleontologist [Pierre] Teilhard de Chardin.&quot; The Omega Point of the title &quot;[is] the possible idea that human consciousness is reaching a point of exhaustion and that what comes next may be either a paroxysm or something enormously sublime and unenvisionable.&quot; &quot;Point Omega&quot; is DeLillo&#x27;s shortest novel to date, and he has said it could be considered a companion piece to &quot;The Body Artist&quot;: &quot;In its reflections on time and loss, this may be a philosophical novel and maybe, considering its themes, the book shares a place in my work with &quot;The Body Artist&quot;, another novel of abbreviated length.&quot;
Reviews were polarized, with some saying the novel was a return to form and innovative, while others complained about its brevity and lack of plot and engaging characters. Upon its initial release, &quot;Point Omega&quot; spent one week on &quot;The New York Times Best Seller list&quot;, peaking at No. 35 on the extended version of the list during its one-week stay on the list.

In a January 29, 2010, interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, DeLillo discussed at great length &quot;Point Omega&quot;, his views of writing, and his plans for the future. When asked why his recent novels had been shorter, DeLillo replied, &quot;Each book tells me what it wants or what it is, and I&#x27;d be perfectly content to write another long novel. It just has to happen.&quot; While DeLillo is open to the idea of returning to the form of the long novel, the interview also revealed that he had no interest in doing as many of his literary contemporaries have done and writing a memoir. DeLillo also made some observations on the state of literature and the challenges facing young writers:
It&#x27;s tougher to be a young writer today than when I was a young writer. I don&#x27;t think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don&#x27;t think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don&#x27;t think publishers have that kind of tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.

In a February 21, 2010, interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, DeLillo reaffirmed his belief in the validity and importance of the novel in a technology- and media-driven age, offering a more optimistic opinion of the future of the novel than his contemporary Philip Roth had done in a recent interview:

It is the form that allows a writer the greatest opportunity to explore human experience...For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because there are so many varieties of human experience, so many kinds of interaction between humans, and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that can&#x27;t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. That sounds pretty grand, but I think it&#x27;s true.

DeLillo received two further significant literary awards in 2010: the St. Louis Literary Award on October 21, 2010 (previous recipients include Salman Rushdie, E.L. Doctorow, John Updike, William Gass, Joyce Carol Oates, Joan Didion and Tennessee Williams); and his second PEN Award, the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction, on October 13, 2010.

DeLillo&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;The Angel Esmeralda: Nine Stories&quot;, covering short stories published between 1979 and 2011, was published in November 2011. It received favorable reviews and was a finalist for both the 2012 Story Prize award and the 2012 PEN/Faulkner, as well as being longlisted for the Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award. &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; contributor Liesl Schillinger praised it, saying, &quot;DeLillo packs fertile ruminations and potent consolation into each of these rich, dense, concentrated stories.&quot;

DeLillo received the 2012 Carl Sandburg Literary Award on October 17, 2012, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago. The prize is &quot;presented annually to an acclaimed author in recognition of outstanding contributions to the literary world and honors a significant work or body of work that has enhanced the public&#x27;s awareness of the written word.&quot;

On January 29, 2013, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Luca Guadagnino would direct an adaptation of &quot;The Body Artist&quot; called &quot;Body Art&quot;. On April 26, 2013, it was announced that DeLillo had received the inaugural Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction (formerly the Library of Congress Creative Achievement Award for Fiction), with the presentation of the award due to take place during the 2013 National Book Festival, Sept. 21–22, 2013.

The prize honors &quot;an American literary writer whose body of work is distinguished not only for its mastery of the art but for its originality of thought and imagination. The award seeks to commend strong, unique, enduring voices that—throughout long, consistently accomplished careers—have told us something about the American experience.&quot; In a statement issued in response to the award, DeLillo said, &quot;When I received news of this award, my first thoughts were of my mother and father, who came to this country the hard way, as young people confronting a new language and culture. In a significant sense, the Library of Congress Prize is the culmination of their efforts and a tribute to their memory.&quot;

In November 2012, DeLillo revealed that he was at work on a new novel, his 16th, and that &quot;the [main] character spends a lot of time watching file footage on a wide screen, images of a disaster.&quot; In August 2015, DeLillo&#x27;s publisher Simon &amp; Schuster announced that the novel, &quot;Zero K&quot;, would be published in May 2016. The advanced blurb for the novel is as follows:

Jeffrey Lockhart&#x27;s father, Ross, is a George Soros-like billionaire now in his sixties, with a younger wife, Artis, whose health is failing. Ross is the primary investor in a deeply remote and secret compound where death is controlled and bodies are preserved until a future moment when medicine and technology can reawaken them. Jeffrey joins Ross and Artis at the compound to say &quot;an uncertain farewell&quot; to her as she surrenders her body. Ross Lockhart is not driven by the hope for immortality, for power and wealth beyond the grave. He is driven by love for his wife, for Artis, without whom he feels life is not worth living. It is that which compels him to submit to death long before his time. Jeffrey heartily disapproves. He is committed to living, to &quot;the mingled astonishments of our time, here, on earth. &quot;Thus begins an emotionally resonant novel that weighs the darkness of the world—terrorism, floods, fires, famine, death—against the beauty of everyday life; love, awe, &quot;the intimate touch of earth and sun.&quot; Brilliantly observed and infused with humor, Don Delillo&#x27;s &quot;Zero K&quot; is an acute observation about the fragility and meaning of life, about embracing our family, this world, our language, and our humanity.

In November 2015, DeLillo received the 2015 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters at the 66th National Book Awards ceremony. The ceremony was held on November 8 in New York City, and he was presented his award by Pulitzer Prize winner Jennifer Egan, a writer profoundly influenced by DeLillo&#x27;s work. In his acceptance speech, DeLillo reflected upon his career as a reader as well as a writer, recalling examining his personal book collection and feeling a profound sense of personal connection to literature: &quot;Here I&#x27;m not the writer at all, I&#x27;m a grateful reader. When I look at my bookshelves I find myself gazing like a museum-goer.&quot; In February 2016, DeLillo was the guest of honor at an academic conference dedicated to his work, &quot;Don DeLillo: Fiction Rescues History&quot;, a three-day event at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris.

Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2018, DeLillo revealed he was working on a new novel, his 17th, &quot;set three years in the future. But I&#x27;m not trying to imagine the future in the usual terms. I&#x27;m trying to imagine what has been torn apart and what can be put back together, and I don&#x27;t know the answer. I hope I can arrive at an answer through writing the fiction.&quot;

===2020s===

DeLillo&#x27;s 17th novel, &quot;The Silence&quot;, was published by Scribner in October 2020. In February 2021, producer Uri Singer acquired the rights to the novel; later the same year, reports emerged that the playwright Jez Butterworth was planning to adapt &quot;The Silence&quot; for the screen.

The first Library of America volume of DeLillo&#x27;s writings was published in October 2022. The volume, titled &quot;Don DeLillo: Three Novels of the 1980s&quot;, collects the three major works DeLillo published during the decade: &quot;The Names&quot; (1982), &quot;White Noise&quot; (1985), and &quot;Libra&quot; (1988). The volume also features two nonfiction essays by DeLillo: &quot;American Blood&quot;, about the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Jack Ruby, and &quot;Silhouette City&quot;, about neo-Nazis in contemporary America. It was edited by the DeLillo scholar Mark Osteen. &quot;Mao II&quot; and &quot;Underworld&quot; are to be anthologized in the autumn of 2023. He is one of a handful of authors so anthologized while alive; others include Eudora Welty, Philip Roth and Ursula K. Le Guin.

DeLillo lives near New York City in the suburb of Bronxville with his wife, Barbara Bennett.

==Plays==
Since 1979, in addition to his novels and occasional essays, DeLillo has been active as a playwright. To date, he has written five major plays: &quot;The Engineer of Moonlight&quot; (1979), &quot;The Day Room&quot; (1986), &quot;Valparaiso&quot; (1999), &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; (2006), and, most recently, &quot;The Word For Snow&quot; (2007). Stage adaptations have also been written for DeLillo&#x27;s novels &quot;Libra&quot; and &quot;Mao II&quot;.

Of his work as a playwright, DeLillo has said that he feels his plays are not influenced by the same writers as his novels: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure who influenced me [as a playwright]. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that mention Beckett and Pinter, but I don&#x27;t know what to say about that. I don&#x27;t feel it myself.&quot;

==Themes and criticism==
DeLillo&#x27;s work displays elements of both modernism and postmodernism. (Though it is worth noting that DeLillo himself claims not to know if his work is postmodern: &quot;It is not [postmodern]. I&#x27;m the last guy to ask. If I had to classify myself, it would be in the long line of modernists, from James Joyce through William Faulkner and so on. That has always been my model.&quot;) He has said the primary influences on his work and development are &quot;abstract expressionism, foreign films, and jazz.&quot; Many of DeLillo&#x27;s books (notably &quot;White Noise&quot;) satirize academia and explore postmodern themes of rampant consumerism, novelty intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and re-integration of the family, and the promise of rebirth through violence. Elsewhere, when asked about being labeled postmodern, DeLillo said: &quot;I don&#x27;t react. But I&#x27;d prefer not to be labeled. I&#x27;m a novelist, period. An American novelist.&quot;

In several of his novels, DeLillo explores the idea of the increasing visibility and effectiveness of terrorists as societal actors and, consequently, the displacement of what he views to be artists&#x27;, and particularly novelists&#x27;, traditional role in facilitating social discourse (&quot;Players&quot;, &quot;Mao II&quot;, &quot;Falling Man&quot;). Another recurring theme in DeLillo&#x27;s books is the saturation of mass media and its role in forming simulacra, resulting in the removal of an event from its context and the consequent draining of meaning (see the highway shooter in &quot;Underworld&quot;, the televised disasters longed for in &quot;White Noise&quot;, the planes in &quot;Falling Man&quot;, the evolving story of the interviewee in &quot;Valparaiso&quot;). The psychology of crowds and the capitulation of individuals to group identity is a theme DeLillo examines in several of his novels, especially in the prologue to &quot;Underworld&quot;, &quot;Mao II&quot;, and &quot;Falling Man&quot;. In a 1993 interview with Maria Nadotti, DeLillo explained

DeLillo&#x27;s contemporary Joyce Carol Oates called him &quot;a man of frightening perception.&quot; Many younger authors, including Jennifer Egan, Jonathan Franzen and David Foster Wallace have cited DeLillo as an influence. Wallace called DeLillo one of the three greatest living fiction authors in the United States, along with Cynthia Ozick and Cormac McCarthy.
Harold Bloom named him as one of the four major American novelists of his time, along with Philip Roth, McCarthy and Thomas Pynchon. Robert McCrum included &quot;Underworld&quot; on his list of the 100 greatest English-language novels, calling it &quot;the work of a writer wired into contemporary America from the ground up, spookily attuned to the weird vibrations of popular culture and the buzz of everyday, ordinary conversations on bus and subway.&quot; In 2006, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; sent out at a query asking for the &quot;single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.&quot; &quot;Underworld&quot; was the runner-up, behind Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; and ahead of McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, John Updike&#x27;s collected &quot;Rabbit Angstrom&quot; and Roth&#x27;s &quot;American Pastoral&quot;. In the accompanying essay, A. O. Scott compared DeLillo&#x27;s style to those of Updike and Roth: &quot;Like &quot;American Pastoral&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot; is a chronologically fractured story drawn by a powerful nostalgic undertow back to the redolent streets of a postwar Eastern city...but whereas Updike and Roth work to establish connection and coherence in the face of time&#x27;s chaos, DeLillo is an artist of diffusion and dispersal, of implication and missing information. But more than his other books, &quot;Underworld&quot; is concerned with roots, in particular with ethnicity...and the characteristic rhythms of DeLillo&#x27;s prose – the curious noun-verb inversions, the quick switches from abstraction to earthiness, from the decorous to the profane, are shown to arise, as surely as Roth&#x27;s do, from the polyglot idiom of the old neighborhood.&quot;

Critics of DeLillo argue that his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood&#x27;s review of Zadie Smith&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;White Teeth&quot;, he dismissed the work of authors like DeLillo, Wallace, and Smith as &quot;hysterical realism&quot;. Bruce Bawer famously criticized DeLillo&#x27;s novels, insisting they weren&#x27;t actually novels at all but &quot;tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It&#x27;s better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a &quot;human&quot; – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards.&quot;

B. R. Myers devoted an entire chapter (&quot;Edgy Prose&quot;) of &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;, his 2002 critique of recent American literary fiction, to dissecting passages from DeLillo&#x27;s books and arguing that they are banal ideas badly written. Most critics, however, regard DeLillo as a gifted stylist; reviewing &quot;Mao II,&quot; Michiko Kakutani said that &quot;The writing is dazzling; the images, so radioactive they glow afterward in our minds.&quot;

* Bright Eyes begins their song &quot;Gold Mine Gutted&quot; from &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot; with: &quot;It was Don DeLillo, whiskey neat, and a blinking midnight clock. Speakers on the TV stand, just a turntable to watch.&quot;.
* Too Much Joy&#x27;s song &quot;Sort of Haunted House&quot;, from &quot;Mutiny&quot;, is inspired by DeLillo.

<text>Interstate 73 (I-73) is a north–south Interstate Highway, currently located entirely within the US state of North Carolina. It travels , from south of Ellerbe, North Carolina to northeast of Stokesdale, providing a freeway connection to Greensboro and Asheboro. Other than a short segment near the Piedmont Triad International Airport west of Greensboro, the interstate runs concurrently with at least one other route.

I-73 was planned to be a much longer corridor, defined by various federal laws to run from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. North Carolina continues to build sections of the route, while South Carolina has shown support for building it but is still searching for funds. However, once active projects are completed, it will only run from Myrtle Beach to the North Carolina-Virginia state line along U.S. Route 220. Michigan abandoned the project in 2001, diverting the funds to safety improvement projects along the corridor instead. Virginia completed initial planning, but also abandoned the project in 2024 due to lack of funding. Ohio did not show interest in the project, as its corridor is either served by existing freeways or four-lane highways. West Virginia is building its section, mostly along US 52, as a four-lane divided highway, but not meeting the Interstate Highway standards.

Associated with these plans are those for the extension of I-74 from Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach, with several highway overlaps contemplated.

===North Carolina===
, I-73 begins south of Ellerbe, in a concurrency with I-74 and U.S. Highway 220 (US 220), to north of Asheboro. I-73 and I-74 travel north through northern Richmond County and into eastern Montgomery County. In Montgomery County, the Interstates pass between the county&#x27;s eastern border and the Uwharrie National Forest. The freeway enters Randolph County and passes just west of Asheboro. In Randleman, I-74 splits northwest toward High Point and Winston-Salem. North of the I-74 split, I-73 passes over Randleman Lake, a reservoir formed by the blocking of the Deep River and passes into Guilford County. Entering Greensboro, it ends its concurrency with US 220 as it goes northwest along the Greensboro Urban Loop with US 421 after a brief parallel with I-85. At its connection with I-40, US 421 continues north (or geographically west) with I-40 to Winston-Salem, while I-73 continues and I-840 begins. At the Bryan Boulevard exit, I-73 separates from I-840, the latter continuing northeast along the loop. Meanwhile, I-73 turns westward, passing Piedmont Triad International Airport and continuing until it crosses NC 68. The road then resumes its northward direction, stretching before reconverging with US 220 near the Haw River. 

==History==
In 1979, K.A. Ammar, a businessman from Bluefield, West Virginia, started the Bluefield-to-Huntington Highway Association in order to widen US 52, a very dangerous two-lane road used to transport coal from mines to barges on the Ohio River. With coal employment in decline and the desire to bring in other businesses, Ammar worked to get the road improved. In 1989, Bluefield State College Professor John Sage learned of plans to add more Interstate Highways. Ammar and Sage came up with the idea for a road that would be called I-73, to run from Detroit, Michigan, to Charleston, South Carolina. Ammar and others promoted the idea to the people of Portsmouth, Ohio, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

In 1991, as Congress worked on reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Act, the people from West Virginia worked to get I-73 approved; the highway would run alongside US 52. The influential Robert Byrd, at the time West Virginia&#x27;s senior senator, chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee, but even Byrd said funding for such a highway would be hard to find. In North Carolina, Marc Bush of the Greensboro Area Chamber of Commerce admitted the plan would benefit his area but said it was not a priority.

The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) defined High Priority Corridor 5, the &quot;I-73/74 North–South Corridor&quot; from Charleston, South Carolina, through Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Portsmouth, Ohio, to Cincinnati, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan. This would provide for a single corridor from Charleston, splitting at Portsmouth, with I-74 turning west to its current east end in Cincinnati, and I-73 continuing north to Detroit.
In North Carolina, any new construction would require more money than the state had available, but Walter C. Sprouse Jr., executive director of the Randolph County Economic Development Corporation, pointed out that most of the route of I-73 included roads already scheduled for improvements that would make them good enough for interstate designation. A connector between I-77 and US 52 at Mount Airy was planned, and US 52 from Mount Airy to Winston-Salem and US 311 from Winston-Salem to High Point were four-lane divided highways. A US 311 bypass of High Point was planned, which would eventually connect to US 220 at Randleman. I-73 would follow US 220 to Rockingham. Another possibility was following I-40 from Winston-Salem to Greensboro. Congestion on US 52 in Winston-Salem was anticipated to be an issue. The route through High Point was approved in May 1993.

However, by November of that year, an organization called Job Link, made up of business leaders from northern North Carolina and southern Virginia, wanted a major highway to connect Roanoke with the Greensboro area. It could be I-73, the group said, but did not have to be. In April 1995, John Warner, who chaired the Senate subcommittee that would select the route of I-73, announced his support for the Job Link proposal. This distressed Winston-Salem officials who were counting on I-73, though Greensboro had never publicly sought the road. But an aide to US Senator Lauch Faircloth said the 1991 law authorizing I-73 required the road to go through Winston-Salem. Faircloth got around this requirement, though, by asking Warner to call the highway to Winston-Salem I-74. In May, Warner announced plans to propose legislation that made the plan for two Interstates official.

The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 added a branch from Toledo, Ohio, to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, via the US 223 and US 127 corridors. (At the time, US 127 north of Lansing was part of US 27.) It also gave details for the alignments in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. I-73 and I-74 were to split near Bluefield, joining again between Randleman and Rockingham; both would end at Charleston. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the sections of I-73 and I-74 south of I-81 in Virginia (with I-74 to end at I-73 near Myrtle Beach) on July 25, 1996, allowing for them to be marked once built to Interstate standards and connected to other Interstate Highways. The final major change came with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century of 1998 (TEA-21), when both routes were truncated to Georgetown, South Carolina.

North Carolina took the lead in signing highways as I-73 following AASHTO&#x27;s approval and since has finished and approved construction projects to build new sections of the Interstate Highway. , the route is signed along of freeway from the intersection of US 220 and NC 68 north of Greensboro to south of Ellerbe and an additional is complete but not signed south of Rockingham. The only other progress in building I-73 can be seen in Virginia and South Carolina. In 2005, Virginia completed an environmental impact statement (EIS) for its recommended route for I-73 from I-81 in Roanoke to the North Carolina border. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved the EIS report in April 2007. Virginia can now go ahead to draw up plans to construct the highway and proceed to build it once funds are obtained. South Carolina also has shown recent interest in building its section of I-73 with a corridor selected for the route from I-95 to Myrtle Beach in 2006 and a final decision on how the highway should be routed north of I-95 to the North Carolina border in July 2007. In January 2006, the South Carolina state legislature introduced bills to construct I-73 as a toll highway. It is hoped a guaranteed stream of revenue will allow it to build its section of I-73 within 10 years. The FHWA approved South Carolina&#x27;s proposal on August 10, 2007.

On January 9, 2019, it was announced that the North Carolina Department of Transportation&#x27;s (NCDOT) State Transportation Improvement Program for 2020 to 2029 included connecting I-73 with US 74 six years sooner than planned. A $146.1-million contract was awarded for the of four-lane freeway with &quot;substantial completion&quot; by late 2023.

Ohio and Michigan both abandoned further environmental studies on their portions of I-73. Most of the I-73 corridor in both of these states follows existing freeways or highways scheduled to be upgraded to freeways under plans that predate I-73.

==Future==
===South Carolina===
I-73 and I-74 both will begin at Myrtle Beach. I-74 splits to the northwest to Rockingham, North Carolina.
Future I-73 will traverse northeastern South Carolina, from the Grand Strand to Bennettsville. The current alignment will replace South Carolina Highway 22 (SC 22) and run parallel north of US 501 and SC 38. In June 2017, the US Army Corps of Engineers approved permits required to build I-73.

On May 30, 2006, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) announced its preferred routing of I-73 between Myrtle Beach and I-95. I-73 will begin where SC 22 starts at US 17 near Briarcliffe Acres. It will then proceed northwesterly, crossing the proposed routing of I-74 (currently SC 31, the Carolina Bays Parkway). After passing Conway, I-73 will leave SC 22 at a new interchange to be constructed west of US 701 and will then use a new highway to be built between SC 22 and SC 917 north of Cool Spring. I-73 will then use an upgraded SC 917 to cross the Little Pee Dee River. It will then proceed on a new freeway alignment between SC 917 and I-95 that would have an interchange with US 76 west of Mullins and then would proceed northwesterly to an exit with US 501 near Latta, passing that city to the south before intersecting I-95 near SC 38. After crossing I-95, I-73 will use the chosen middle route, roughly paralleling SC 38 to proceed further north to the North Carolina state line. These alternative corridors were formally announced to the public on September 7, 2006, at a meeting in Bennettsville. The number of possible routes was reduced to three, and a final decision on the preferred northern route was announced on July 19, 2007. The central route caused the least disruption to homes, farms, and wetlands. NCDOT and SCDOT previously agreed to an I-73 corridor crossing the state line along SC 38 and NC 38 near Hamlet, North Carolina, on February 11, 2005. 

In February 2008, the record of decision (ROD) for the final EIS for the section of I-73 from I-95 to SC 22 was signed. An October 22, 2008, ceremony marked the signing of the ROD for the section from near Hamlet to I-95.

On November 7, 2011, Myrtle Beach city council member Wayne Gray asked area elected officials to consider using Road Improvement and Development Effort (RIDE) funds to pay for a portion of I-73.

In June 2012, Miley and Associates of Columbia recommended improvements to SC 38 and US 501 to create the Grand Strand Expressway (GSX), a position long held by the Coastal Conservation League, which asked for the study. South Carolina Representative Alan D. Clemmons, head of the National I-73 Corridor Association, said such a plan had been considered but was not likely. Nancy Cave of the Coastal Conservation League reiterated support for upgrading SC 38 and US 501, along with US 521 and SC 9, after results of a new study were presented at an August 1, 2012, meeting of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. The study claimed that 90,000 people could leave the area 10 hours faster in an evacuation with I-73 and Southern Evacuation Lifeline (SELL) both in place.

The &quot;I-73 Intermediate Traffic and Revenue Study&quot; by C&amp;M Associates, dated February 2016, was to be presented to state transportation officials March 24, 2016 and included upgrades to SC 22. RIDE III, if approved by voters, would also provide funding for the Southern Evacuation Lifeline, a proposed limited-access highway which would start at the western terminus of SC 22 with US 501 and allow a more direct route west from the southern Strand, while simultaneously, along with SC 22, completing a beltway around the Myrtle Beach area. Voters subsequently approved RIDE III in November 2016.

Interest in I-73 was renewed in early 2021 due in part to the announcement of the American Jobs Plan. Two years later in September 2023, SCDOT announced that Phase I of the project, which would connect I-95 in Dillon County to US 501 south of Latta, would be &quot;shovel ready&quot; by the new year. They also announced that had begun right-of-way purchasing within Horry County from the Little Pee Dee River to the eventual connecting point for I-73 and SC 22. However, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster&#x27;s 2024 executive budget, which was released in early-January 2024, did not include any funding for building the route. He noted that although he still supports the I-73 expansion into the state, the support among county and local leaders had waned. Despite the lack of funding, Horry County still plans to work on their section of the future freeway pending the passing of the RIDE IV program.

I-73 was planned to connect Martinsville and Roanoke, then head west to Blacksburg before entering West Virginia.

Except for a divergence around the east side of Martinsville, the planned routing was to parallel US 220 to I-581 in Roanoke, which I-73 was then to follow to I-81. Signs that say &quot;Future I-73 Corridor&quot; can be found along I-581. From Roanoke, I-73 was to run concurrently with I-81 to near Christiansburg and then use a completed Virginia Smart Road to Blacksburg. The rest of the way to West Virginia was to be an upgrade of US 460, Corridor Q of the Appalachian Development Highway System.

The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) ran studies on this corridor, but its construction had very low priority compared to other projects in the state. Additionally, funding for the route was used for other more urgent projects.

In a July 2024 presentation to the Commonwealth Transportation Board, which has ultimate authority over all transportation projects in the state, VDOT recommended the board rescind its original 2001 approval of I-73&#x27;s routing. VDOT stated that the project&#x27;s earmarked federal funding has been repurposed, and additional funding had not materialized and was unlikely to be found; in addition, the board itself had since adopted a policy requiring review of all location decisions after three years. At its September 2024 meeting, the board voted to rescind its approval. Any construction of I-73 would be required to start the entire location-study, environmental impact and public-comment process again.

===West Virginia===
Future I-73 is planned to enter, from Virginia, near Bluefield and then go northwesterly along the future route of West Virginia Route 108; formerly known as the King Coal Highway to Huntington.

I-73 will continue next to US 460 (Corridor Q) from the Virginia state line west to Bluefield. There it will join with I-74, which splits from I-77 just across the border from Virginia. For the rest of its path through West Virginia from Bluefield to Huntington and Ohio, I-73 will follow US 52 and also have bypasses near it. U.S. 52 is currently being upgraded to a four-lane divided highway; and also some new construction known as the King Coal Highway also now known as West Virginia Route 108 to Williamson and the Tolsia Highway the rest of the way to Huntington. This section has been sporadically marked as the Future I-73/I-74 Corridor with signs but is not being built to Interstate standards due to a lack of funding.

===Ohio===
Future I-73 is planned to parallel US 52 to Portsmouth, then north with US 23 through Columbus and Toledo.

In Ohio, I-73 was planned to parallel US 52 to Portsmouth. A four-lane controlled highway known as the Portsmouth Bypass was under construction. When completed in 2019, this bypass runs from US 52 to US 23, along State Route 823 (SR 823) just north of Lucasville. I-73 and I-74 would continue north to SR 32, where I-74 would split from I-73, and I-73 would head north along US 23 the rest of the way through Columbus to Toledo and the Michigan state line. The part from Portsmouth to Columbus is Corridor C of the Appalachian Development Highway System. In Columbus, I-73 would most likely follow SR 315 through Columbus. In Toledo, I-73 would likely follow I-280&#x27;s alignment and likely route along I-475 before branching off with US 23 into Michigan. However, routes in the Columbus and Toledo areas have not yet been officially determined. Ohio has abandoned further study of the I-73 corridor, since the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) plans to eventually upgrade the US 23/US 52 corridor from Toledo to Portsmouth to a freeway. Nonetheless, the option to designate the corridor as I-73 once all upgrades are complete remains open, contingent upon what happens with the connecting route in West Virginia.

On February 5, 2009, the Governor Ted Strickland proposed allowing tolls to be collected on newly built sections of highway. One of the proposed routes includes the Columbus–Toledo corridor, which is currently served by US 23 as an expressway largely without limited access.

A new project has been initiated by ODOT to complete a study of the US 23 corridor between the village of Waldo and I-270. The goal of this project is to create a free-flow connection between Columbus and Toledo. Some of the alternatives to be explored include upgrading the existing alignment or creating new corridors to US 33 to the west or I-71 to the east of the current corridor. There are no plans to sign this as an Interstate Highway at this time. However, there has a renewed push for the extension of both I-73 and I-74 in the state since 2022.

===Michigan===

Future I-73 is planned to go northwesterly to Jackson then go north with US 127 to Grayling. From there, the corridor would have continued along I-75 to Sault Ste. Marie.

The original defined alignment of I-73 would have run along I-75 to Detroit. However, Congress amended that definition in 1995 to have a branch along the US 223 corridor to south of Jackson and the US 127 corridor north to I-75 near Grayling. From Grayling, it would have used I-75 to Sault Ste. Marie. Except south of Jackson, where the existing highways are two-lane roads and a section of road north of Lansing where the freeway reverts to a divided highway, this corridor is mostly a rural four-lane freeway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) included using the US 223 corridor as one of its three options to build I-73 in 2000. The others included using the US 127 corridor all the way into Ohio with a connection to the Ohio Turnpike or using US 127 south and a new freeway connection to US 223 at Adrian. MDOT abandoned further study of I-73 after June 12, 2001, diverting remaining funding to safety improvement projects along the corridor. The department stated there was a &quot;lack of need&quot; for sections of the proposed freeway, and the project website was closed down in 2002. According to press reports in 2011, a group advocating on behalf of the freeway was working to revive the I-73 project in Michigan. According to an MDOT spokesperson, &quot;to my knowledge, we&#x27;re not taking that issue up again&quot;. The Lenawee County Road Commission is not interested in the freeway, and, according to the president of the Adrian Area Chamber of Commerce, &quot;there seems to be little chance of having an I-73 link between Toledo and Jackson built in the foreseeable future.&quot;

<text>Interstate 74 (I-74) is an Interstate Highway in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. Its western end is at an interchange with I-80 in Davenport, Iowa; the eastern end of its Midwest segment is at an interchange with I-75 in Cincinnati, Ohio. The major cities that I-74 connects to include Davenport, Iowa; Peoria, Bloomington, and Champaign, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio. I-74 also exists as several disconnected sections of highways in North Carolina.

===Iowa===
In the state of Iowa, I-74 runs south from I-80 for before crossing into Illinois on the I-74 Bridge. North of the Mississippi River, I-74 bisects Bettendorf and Davenport.

===Illinois===
In the state of Illinois, I-74 runs south from Moline to Galesburg; from this point, it runs southeast through Peoria to the Bloomington–Normal area and I-55. I-74 continues southeasterly to the Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area, intersecting I-57. The Interstate then runs east past Danville at the Illinois–Indiana state line. U.S. Route 150 (US 150) parallels I-74 in Illinois for its entire length, save the last few miles on the eastern end (in Danville, when US 150 turns south on Illinois Route 1 (IL 1)), where it parallels US 136.

===Indiana===

In the state of Indiana, I-74 runs east from the Illinois state line to the Crawfordsville area before turning southeasterly. It then runs around the city center of Indianapolis along I-69 and I-465. Once I-74 reaches the southeast side of Indianapolis, it diverges from I-69 and I-465 and continues to the southeast. It then enters Ohio at Harrison.

===Ohio===

In the state of Ohio, I-74 runs southeast from the Indiana border to the western segment&#x27;s current eastern terminus at I-75 just north of Downtown Cincinnati. It is also signed with US 52 for its entire length. While planned to continue through West Virginia and Virginia to the I-74 section in North Carolina, the route remains unsigned or unbuilt past Cincinnati. At this point, I-74 would follow US 52 or more likely follow State Route 32 (SR 32), east from Cincinnati.

===North Carolina===

In the state of North Carolina, , I-74 exists in several segments, starting with a concurrency with I-77 at the Virginia border. This includes the most western portion from I-77 to US 52 just south of Mount Airy, a segment first opened to traffic as a bypass of High Point then extended west to I-40 east of Winston-Salem and east to I-73 near Randleman, then another along the southern segment of I–73 and US 220 from just north of Asheboro to south of Ellerbe, and finally a more eastern segment that runs from Laurinburg to an end at NC 41 near Lumberton. The latest segment to be signed, from I-40 to High Point, occurred after the federal government approved signing this section as I-74 in mid-2013, despite the highway not being up to current Interstate Highway standards. It was uncertain why the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) made an exception, but this might have been the result of a misinterpretation when a state highway administrator asked for Interstate designation for another section and &quot;Future Interstate&quot; for the section already completed that did not meet standards.

==Future==
Long-range plans call for I-74 to continue east and south of Cincinnati to North Carolina using SR 32 from Cincinnati to Piketon, Ohio, and then the proposed I-73 from Portsmouth, Ohio, through West Virginia (along parts of current US 52 and Future WV Route 108) to I-77. It would then follow I-77 through Virginia into North Carolina, where I-74 splits from I-77 near the Virginia state line and runs eastward to northwest US 52, which it will eventually follow to Winston-Salem, then through High Point to I-73. I-73 and I-74 overlap to Rockingham.

In 1996, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the signing of highways as I-74 along its proposed path east (south) of I-81 in Wytheville, Virginia, where those highways meet Interstate Highway standards. North Carolina started putting up I-74 signs along its roadways in 1997. , I-74 is proposed to follow the path of I-77 through the state of Virginia but remains unsigned from the West Virginia border to the North Carolina border.

=== Ohio ===
The 1991 plan to build I-73 soon included an extension of I-74 from where it ended in Hamilton County to I-73 at Portsmouth, Ohio, possibly along SR 32.

In November 1991, Congress passed the $151-billion (equivalent to $ in ) Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) that included the I-73/74 North-South Corridor and made I-73 a priority and included an extension of I-74 from Hamilton County to I-73 at Portsmouth.

On August 31, 1992, the Ohio Turnpike Commission passed a resolution to study making the extension of I-74 a toll road. Congress had authorized paying for 80 percent of the cost, but the state would have to pay the remainder of the $56 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The Ohio Turnpike Commission proposed that the extension run along SR 32; while Representative Jim Bunning of Kentucky wanted the road to begin in the west as part of a greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky bypass, returning to Ohio near Maysville, Kentucky.

=== West Virginia ===

, I-74 remains unbuilt in the state of West Virginia. The West Virginia Department of Transportation (WVDOT) is currently upgrading the Tolsia Highway to four lanes but not to Interstate Highway standards.

It was estimated that improving US 52 to Interstate standards in West Virginia would cost $2 billion (equivalent to $ in ). Still, by 1994, improvements to US 52 were planned, and future plans called for I-73 to follow that route. The I-74 extension seemed more certain.

=== North Carolina ===

Two sections of I-74 in North Carolina are currently under construction. These include building the bypass of Rockingham with I-73 and the eastern half of the Winston-Salem Northern Beltway.

The proposed path of I-74 east of I-95 in North Carolina is still being debated. The current plan takes the route along US 74 to NC 211 near Bolton then south along US 17 to near the South Carolina border. These sections are not currently proposed to be built perhaps for another 20 to 30 years. The North Carolina Turnpike Authority—at the request of officials in Brunswick County—are studying whether a toll road could get the section of I-74 in that county built faster.

Starting around Laurinburg and Maxton and to the east, I-74 runs concurrent with US 74. This was the first time that a U.S. Route and Interstate Highway with the same number have been designated on the same highway. A similar situation occurred more recently in June 2015 when Wisconsin started routing I-41 along the route of US 41.

===South Carolina===

On February 11, 2005, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) came to an agreement over where I-74 (and I-73) would cross the border between the two states. It was decided that I-74 would cross the line as a northern extension of South Carolina Highway 31 (SC 31). SC 31 is being used a temporaily placeholder designation until the I-74 from North Carolina connect the South Carolina proposed route. I-74 is then proposed to end south of Myrtle Beach at SC 707. In the 1990s, both I-73 and I-74 were to end at Georgetown but funding cannot allow for the possible extensions to Georgetown or Charleston. In November 2019, both NCDOT and SCDOT released maps of where I-74 could go to from South Carolina to North Carolina.

<text>White Pine County is a largely rural, mountain county along the central eastern boundary of the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,080. Its county seat is Ely. The name &quot;(Rocky Mountain) white pine&quot; is an old name for the limber pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;), a common tree in the county&#x27;s mountains. The county boasts dark skies, clean air and millions of acres of unspoiled public land. It is the home of Great Basin National Park, one of America&#x27;s most remote and least visited national parks. It is also home to no less than 14 federally designated wilderness areas, offering an abundance of terrain available to explore for hikers, backpackers, skiers, hunters and anglers. The Ely Shoshone Indian Reservation is located in the county, on the south side of the City of Ely. The reservation has a land area of and a 2000 census official resident population of 133 people.

==History==
European settlement in White Pine County began with mining exploration, activity generated by the Pony Express Trail (which passes through the county), and farming.

The county was established by the Nevada legislature in 1869 from Lander County and named after the heavy growth of limber pine trees in the area, which were then called white pine. Hamilton was the first county seat from 1869 to 1887, when it was replaced by Ely after a fire.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

Several sections of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest exist within the county, within the Snake Range, Egan Range, White Pine Range, Ruby Mountains, and Schell Creek Range. The county also contains Ward Charcoal Ovens State Historic Park and Cave Lake State Park.

In the southeastern part of the county within Great Basin National Park lies Wheeler Peak, the tallest independent mountain within Nevada and the second-highest point within the state (the highest point being Boundary Peak). It is also the most topographically prominent peak in the county and the second-most prominent peak in Nevada (after Mount Charleston).

===Politics===
A swing county for much of the 20th century, White Pine County has become powerfully Republican like the rest of rural Nevada since the 1980s. The last Democrat to carry a majority in the county was Jimmy Carter in 1976. The most recent Democratic win in the county was a 36% plurality by Bill Clinton in 1992; Clinton went on to lose the county in 1996 by just 2 votes. Donald Trump received over 70% of the county&#x27;s vote in 2016, 2020, and 2024. The city of Ely and almost all rural areas of the county reflect the county&#x27;s overall Republican leaning. The rural district in the southeast part of the county near the Utah border, encompassing Baker and Great Basin National Park, has a slight Democratic leaning, though there are only 118 voters in the area and the Democratic majority only consisted of 4 votes in 2024.

<text>Washoe County () is a county in the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 census, the population was 486,492, making it Nevada&#x27;s second-most populous county. Its county seat is Reno. Washoe County is included in the Reno, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washoe County was created on November 25, 1861, as one of the original nine counties of the Nevada Territory. It is named after the Washoe people who originally inhabited the area. It was consolidated with Roop County in 1864. Washoe City was the first county seat in 1861 and was replaced by Reno in 1871.

In 1911, a small band of Shoshone and Bannock led by Mike Daggett killed four stockmen in Washoe County. A posse was formed, and on February 26, 1911, at the Battle of Kelley Creek, eight of Daggett&#x27;s band were killed, along with one member of the posse, Ed Hogle. Three children and a woman who survived the battle were captured. The remains of some of the members of the band were repatriated from the Smithsonian Institution to the Fort Hall Idaho Shoshone-Bannock Tribe in 1994.

In 1918, Washoe County elected the first woman elected to the Nevada Legislature, Sadie Hurst, a Republican.

As of 2013, &quot;Washoe County is the first school district in the state to offer Paiute classes,&quot; offering an elective course in the Paiute language at Spanish Springs High School and North Valleys High School.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.7%) is water. The highest point in Washoe County is Mount Rose at , while the most topographically prominent peak is Virginia Peak.

There are two incorporated cities within the county, namely Reno and Sparks. In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should become one combined governmental body. According to unofficial results the day after the election, 54% of voters approved of the ballot measure to consolidate the governments.

The Truckee Meadows of Washoe County starts at the furthest southern runway of Reno Tahoe International Airport, GPS Coordinates 39.468836,-119.770912 and runs south east. Rattle Snake Mountain at Huffaker Park, follows the span of Steamboat Creek to the southern east end of Washoe County. This is the last of the range/prairie and wild grass water shed from the eastern range of the Reno Tahoe basin.

Washoe County is a wildfire prone area. These risks are particularly in Southern Reno (or areas just outside the city limits). As many structures are now being built in forested areas, along with often having favorable fire weather, most residents are under severe fire danger. Many fires in Southwest Reno have been destructive or spread quickly, such as the Caughlin Fire in 2011.

==Politics==














Washoe County was a Republican stronghold throughout the late twentieth century, having only voted for the Democratic candidate once between 1944 and 2004 (in the 1964 Democratic landslide). Since the 1990s, it has become more competitive, going from a 22-point win for George H. W. Bush in 1988 to only a three-point win for Bush in 1992. From 1996 to 2004, the Republican candidate tallied a margin greater than four points. Barack Obama won it by a 12-point margin in 2008, and since then, it has always voted Democratic in presidential elections, albeit by relatively narrow margins consistently under 5%. However, Republicans still hold the majority of the county&#x27;s seats in the state legislature. Democratic strength is concentrated in Reno and Sparks, while the rest of the county is much more Republican.

The county is governed by an elected five-member Board of County Commissioners and an appointed county manager. The commissioners serve staggered four-year terms - three are elected during midterm elections and two during presidential elections.

<text>Nye County is a county in the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 census, the population was 51,591. Its county seat is Tonopah. At , Nye is Nevada&#x27;s largest county by area and the third-largest county in the contiguous United States, behind San Bernardino County of California and Coconino County of Arizona.

Nye County comprises the Pahrump micropolitan statistical area, which is included in the Las Vegas-Henderson combined statistical area.

In 2010, Nevada&#x27;s center of population was in southern Nye County, near Yucca Mountain.

The Nevada Test Site and proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository are in southwestern Nye County, and are the focus of a great deal of controversy. The federal government manages 92% of the county&#x27;s land. A 1987 attempt to stop the nuclear waste site resulted in the creation of Bullfrog County, Nevada, which was dissolved two years later.

The county has several environmentally sensitive areas, including Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, the White River Valley, several Great Basin sky islands, and part of Death Valley National Park. Visitors to Death Valley often stay at Beatty or Amargosa Valley.

Nye County is one of 10 Nevada counties where prostitution is legal. The county has no incorporated cities. The seat of government in Tonopah is from Pahrump, where about 86% of the county&#x27;s population resides.

==History==
Nye County was established during the American Civil War in 1864 and named after James W. Nye, the first governor of the Nevada Territory and later a U.S. Senator after it was admitted as a state. The first county seat was Ione in 1864, followed by Belmont in 1867, and finally Tonopah in 1905.

The county&#x27;s first boom came in the early 20th century, when Rhyolite and Tonopah, as well as Goldfield in nearby Esmeralda County, had gold- and silver-mining booms. In 1906, Goldfield had 30,000 residents, Tonopah nearly 10,000, and Rhyolite peaked at about 10,000. These cities were linked by the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad.

After the boom died, Nye County withered. By 1910, the population had plummeted to about 7,500 before sinking to near 3,000 in the middle of the century. With development at the military test site and increasing employment and resources, the population stabilized. After the 1990s, when Pahrump became a bedroom community for Las Vegas, it had high rates of population growth.

Periodically, discussions have arisen of moving the county seat to Pahrump, or splitting off the southern portion of the county, but neither of these ideas appears to have sufficient support in the county or state government.

From 1987 to 1989, Bullfrog County, Nevada, was split off from Nye County to form a separate political region. Its population was zero; its creation was an attempt to stop a nuclear waste storage facility from being built in the region.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.09%) is water. The highest and most topographically prominent mountain in the county is Mount Jefferson at .

Nye County is in south-central Nevada. It is Nevada&#x27;s largest county and the third-largest county in the contiguous United States, after San Bernardino County in California and Coconino County in Arizona. Nye County&#x27;s land area of is larger than that of Maryland, Hawaii, Vermont, and New Hampshire, and larger than the combined area of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Delaware. Of this vast land area, only , or just over 7%, is private land; most of it is public land managed by the federal government. Before the Treaty of Ruby Valley, the whole area was controlled by the Western Shoshone people, who say they never ceded territory here. According to the United States Census Bureau the county&#x27;s Census Tract 9805, with a land area of , comprising the Nevada Test Site and Nye County&#x27;s portion of the Nevada Test and Training Range, is the country&#x27;s largest census tract that has no resident population (as of the 2000 census).

Las Vegas, in Clark County, is southeast of Yucca Mountain. Many Pahrump residents commute each way to Las Vegas via Nevada State Route 160, which for much of its length is a four-lane divided highway.

While the line west of Silver Springs was removed, the line from Hazen to Walker Lake (now standard gauge) is still in place, and used several times each week by the Union Pacific to service the NV Energy Fort Churchill Generating Station, near Yerington.

The Eagle Salt Works Railroad ran for 13.5 miles, primarily on the original Central Pacific grade from Luva (two miles east of Fernley) to Eagle Salt Works Railroad.

<text>Lincoln County is a county in the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,499, making it the fourth-least populous county in Nevada. Its county seat is Pioche. Like many counties in Nevada, it is dry and sparsely populated, though notable for containing the Area 51 government Air Force base.

==History==
Lincoln County was established in 1866 after Congress enlarged Nevada by moving its state line eastward and southward at the expense of Utah and Arizona territories. It is named after Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. Original legislation called for the creation of a &quot;Stewart County&quot;, after Nevada Senator William M. Stewart, but this was later changed in a substitute bill. Crystal Springs was the county&#x27;s first seat in 1866, followed by Hiko in 1867 and Pioche in 1871.

In 1870, the county&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Lincoln County Record&quot;, was established. Lincoln County initially included a ranch village and railroad siding named Las Vegas. However, that siding, which led to the future city of Las Vegas, was separated from Lincoln County upon the founding of Clark County effective July 1, 1909, by act of the Nevada Legislature.

Area 51 is in Lincoln County and the county sheriff acts in proxy for the perimeter security forces.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.04%) is water. While only the third-largest county by area in the state of Nevada, it is the seventh-largest county in area in the United States, not including boroughs and census areas in Alaska. The south cliff of Mount Rummel, the summit of which is just north of the county line in White Pine County, contains Lincoln County&#x27;s highest point, at . The highest independent mountain completely within Lincoln County is Shingle Peak, while the county&#x27;s most topographically prominent peak is Mormon Peak.

<text>Humboldt County is a county in the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 17,285. It is a largely rural county that is sparsely populated with the only major city being Winnemucca which has a population of 8,431. Humboldt County comprises the Winnemucca, NV Micropolitan Statistical Area and serves as an important crossroads in the national transportation network. Interstate 80 travels through the southeastern corner of the county, meeting US 95 in Winnemucca that serves as a primary freight corridor between Northern Nevada and Boise, Idaho and the Interstate 84 freight corridor that links much of the Pacific Northwest. The original transcontinental railway, constructed by the Central Pacific Railroad, reached Humboldt County on September 16, 1868. The Western Pacific Railroad would reach Humboldt County by November 1909, providing two mainline rail links to California and the Eastern United States. Both railroads have since been acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad, who continues to serve the region today.

The county contains several areas of land belonging to regionally significant Native American communities including the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe and the Winnemucca Indian Colony of Nevada.

Largely a region with ranchers and farmers, the county came under increased attention after the 2017 proposal of the Thacker Pass Lithium Mine. The mine has been controversial locally and in the national press—as it would be the first major lithium clay mine to open in the United States and be important to the local economy but threatens local ecosystems and indigenous heritage sites.

==History==
Humboldt County is the oldest county in Nevada, created by the Utah Territorial Legislature in 1856. It was also one of Nevada&#x27;s original nine counties created in 1861. The county is named after the Humboldt River, which was named by John C. Frémont after Alexander von Humboldt, a German naturalist, traveler and statesman. Humboldt never saw the places that bear his name. Unionville was the first county seat in 1861 until the mining boom died there and it was moved to Winnemucca on the transcontinental railroad line in 1873. 

The county was the site of an arrest in 2000 that led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada&quot; in 2004.

Humboldt County is referenced in Brandon Flowers&#x27; 2015 song &quot;Digging Up The Heart&quot;, in which the protagonist meets &quot;Christie, queen of Humboldt County&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. It is Nevada&#x27;s fourth-largest county by area.

The Santa Rosa Range runs through eastern Humboldt County. The highest point in the county, Granite Peak, is in the range. The most topographically prominent mountain in Humboldt County is unofficially known as Dan Dobbins Peak and is in the remote Jackson Mountains.

==Politics==
Humboldt County, like most of rural Nevada, is overwhelmingly Republican. This has been especially true in recent elections, with Donald Trump receiving over three-quarters of the vote in both 2020 and 2024. The Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, which lies on the county&#x27;s northern border, is the only Democratic-leaning area of the county, though their population is relatively small in comparison with the city of Winnemucca and the rest of the rural county and other communities such as Paradise Valley, Orovada and Denio, which vote heavily Republican.

Background

Eureka County is strongly Republican; the last time they voted for a Democratic candidate was in 1964, and the last time a Democratic candidate received a quarter of the county&#x27;s vote was in 1988. The last time a Republican candidate failed to receive a majority of the county&#x27;s vote was in 1992, when the vote was somewhat split when independent candidate Ross Perot recorded approximately a third of the county&#x27;s vote. In most recent elections Eureka County has shown the strongest Republican leaning out of all Nevada counties.

However, due to the county&#x27;s low population, its heavy Republican voting does not have a large effect on elections in the state, as a majority of Nevada&#x27;s population live in Democratic-leaning Clark County and Washoe County.

<text>Esmeralda County is a county in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Nevada. As of the 2023 estimate, the population was 736, making it the least populous county in Nevada, and the 20th least populous county in the United States. Esmeralda County does not have any incorporated communities. Its county seat is the town of Goldfield.

Its 2000 census population density of was the second-lowest of any county in the contiguous United States (above Loving County, Texas). Its school district does not have a high school, so students in grades 9–12 go to school in Tonopah, in the Nye County School District.

Most residents live in Goldfield or in the town of Dyer in Fish Lake Valley, near the California border. Esmeralda is the only Nevada county in the Los Angeles TV market (or any California market) as defined by The Nielsen Corporation.

==History==
Esmeralda County is one of the original counties in Nevada, established on November 25, 1861. When it was organized, it comprised the part of the Nevada Territory south of the 39th parallel and east of Mason Valley. &quot;Esmeralda&quot; is the Spanish and Portuguese word for &quot;emerald&quot;. An early California miner from San Jose, James Manning Cory, named the Esmeralda Mining District after Esmeralda the Romani dancer from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;.

Just after the organization of Esmeralda County, the vast majority of the land area had yet to be explored. John C. Frémont was one of the few people who had explored parts of the county. He had crossed Big Smoky Valley in 1845. Also, Aurora and its northern corridor had been encountered. In 1862 and 1863, the area along the Reese River was explored during the Reese River excitement. The event resulted in the establishment of three mining districts in the Toiyabe Range, namely Marysville, Twin River, and Washington, and the establishment of a number of settlements and ranches in Esmeralda County. Explorers pursued south and explored the Shoshone Mountains. The mining district Union was organized after silver was found in 1863 and the settlement of Ione was founded there.

The total area of Esmeralda County more than halved as Nye County was organized on February 16, 1864, entirely out of land that used to be part of Esmeralda County. Esmeralda has had three county seats: Aurora until 1883, Hawthorne from 1883 to 1907 and finally Goldfield. At one point, due to the disputed border with California, Aurora was simultaneously the county seat of both Mono County, California and Esmeralda County. Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) wrote about his time as a miner in the Esmeralda District in his book &quot;Roughing It&quot;.

Esmeralda grew from a gold mining boom in the first years of the 20th century. Goldfield, a town founded in 1902, increased rapidly, and it soon became the largest town in Nevada, with about 20,000 people in 1906, but its population rapidly decreased after the Goldfield, Nevada, labor troubles of 1906–1907. The mines were largely tapped out by the end of the 1910s and the economy and population declined afterwards.

<text>Elko County is a county in the northeastern corner of Nevada, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 53,702. Its county seat is Elko. The county was established on March 5, 1869, from Lander County. Elko County is the fourth-largest county by area in the contiguous United States, ranking lower when the boroughs of Alaska are included. It is one of only 10 counties in the U.S. with more than of area. Elko County is the second-largest county by area in Nevada, with only Nye County being larger. Elko County is part of the Elko micropolitan statistical area. It contains 49.8 percent of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, set up in the late 19th century for the Shoshone-Paiute peoples; they are a federally recognized tribe. Although slightly more than 50% of the reservation is across the border in Owyhee County, Idaho, the majority of tribal members live on the Nevada side. The reservation&#x27;s land area is .

==History==
This area was long inhabited by Native American tribes of the Plateau, particularly the Western Shoshone, Northern Paiute, and Bannock peoples. Their traditional ways were disrupted after European-American settlement, as the two cultures competed for resources and had differing conceptions of land use and property.

Elko County was established in 1869 from Lander County; the name was taken from the name of the county seat, Elko.

In 1877 what became known as the Duck Valley Indian Reservation was established by presidential executive order for the Western Shoshone in this area, after they signed treaties with the United States. Later the Paiute became involved in the Bannock War, but after they were allowed to return from exile in Washington State, in 1886 another executive order was used to expand the reservation to accommodate them. The federally recognized tribe of the two peoples together conducts farming and ranching in this high desert territory.

The population of the county increased markedly in the late 20th century as the economy improved.

On March 14, 2014, the Bureau of Land Management of the United States Department of the Interior sold 29 oil and gas leases for $1.27 million to a collection of six companies that included Noble Energy. The transaction was the first such in Nevada.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. Not counting Alaska&#x27;s boroughs (four of which are also larger), it is the fourth-largest county in area in the United States (behind San Bernardino County, California, Coconino County, Arizona, and Nye County, Nevada). The elevation ranges from about at the edge of the salt flats of the Great Salt Lake Desert, to on the summit of Ruby Dome in the Ruby Mountains. The most topographically prominent mountain in Elko County is Pilot Peak.

The county has three physiographic sections (70% Great Basin section, 20% Payette, 10% Snake River Plain) and 4 watersheds (45% Humboldt River, 30% Upper Snake River, 20% central Nevada desert, 5% Pilot-Thousand Springs).

==Government and politics==











Elko is a highly conservative area. In 2011, all eleven of the partisan county officials were Republican. In every election of the 21st Century (except for 2008), the Republican candidate has received over 70% of the vote in the county. The city of Elko itself voted over 65% Republican on average in 2024, while most of the rural county voted over 80% Republican, with other cities and towns somewhere in between. The city of West Wendover was, in 2024, the only one in the county to have a slight Democratic leaning (specifically in its southern district). The Owyhee Reservation along the county&#x27;s northern border is also heavily Democratic. However, these places have little effect on the overall red leaning of the county due to their relatively small populations.

Both former President Jimmy Carter and then-President George W. Bush made visits to the city of Elko during the 2006 mid-term election. William McKinley visited in 1901; Herbert Hoover made his final campaign broadcast as president from a railroad car in Elko in 1932; Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in Carlin in 1938 during his whistle stop tour; and Barack Obama visited while campaigning in 2008. President Donald Trump arrived in Elko on October 20, 2018, to campaign for Senator Dean Heller during the 2018 midterm elections. In addition, many other high-profile political figures have come to Elko, including former Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2016 Donald Trump Jr. campaigned in Elko during the primary campaign.

==Transportation==

A number of highways maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation, some national in prominence, cross Elko County. The county also maintains a network of county routes; however, many of them are unpaved and receive limited, if any, winter maintenance.

Transportation by means other than road vehicle is limited within Elko County. Commercial air service is available only at the Elko Regional Airport in Elko; the only destination currently served is Salt Lake City International Airport.

==History==
Wheeler County was authorized in 1877. It was organized in 1881, following the establishment and rapid growth of the town of Cumminsville, in anticipation of a Union Pacific Railroad line through that town. Cedar City (now disbanded) was the site of the first seat of government for the county, which covered an area of 48 miles west to east and 25 miles north to south. On November 25, 1884, this area was halved, with the western portion becoming Garfield County, leaving the remainder as Wheeler County with its present boundaries.

The county&#x27;s government was overseen by three commissioners, two from two districts in the more heavily populated southern half of the county, the third from the North. In 1885, the government was deemed to be outgrowing its small courthouse in Cedar City and two men, Cumminsville school superintendent Begelow and Ezra Bartlett Mitchell offered land options outside of Cedar City to build a new courthouse. In a heated election, Mitchell&#x27;s site was chosen over Begelow&#x27;s by a vote of 193 to 90, and the new courthouse led to the establishment of a surrounding town, named Bartlett (Mitchell&#x27;s middle name), to serve as the seat of government. Cedar City collapsed shortly after the government offices there were abandoned.

In 1886, a spur line of the C.B.&amp; Q. railroad was built into the county, ending at a point where the town of Ericson was established.

In 1895, while attempting to construct a ditchway to irrigate farm land between Ericson and Spalding, a dam was built across
Clear Creek. Though the ditch construction was ultimately not successful, the dam created present-day Pibel Lake.

Wheeler County&#x27;s population began to wane after the turn of the 20th century, but in 1904, with the enactment of the Kinkaid Act, a new round of settlers reinvigorated the population.

<text>Washington County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 20,865. Its county seat is Blair. Washington County is part of the Omaha-Council Bluffs, NE-IA Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Washington County is represented by the prefix 29 (it had the 29th-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==History==
Washington County is in eastern Nebraska on the Missouri River. It was explored by Europeans as early as 1739 by Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet, who were on a trapping expedition to Canada. In 1804, Lewis and Clark reported the establishment of the new United States government to a council of Indian chiefs near the present site of Fort Calhoun. As a result of this council, Fort Atkinson was established in 1819 and served as a key midwestern outpost until 1827.

The first permanent settlement in Washington County was in 1854. In that same year, the county was organized as one of the eight original counties proclaimed by acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming; it was reorganized in 1855. The county seat has been in three different towns: Fort Calhoun, DeSoto, and Blair, its present site since 1869.

The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Generating Station south of Blair, which was North America&#x27;s smallest commercial nuclear reactor by rated capacity, was closed in October 2016 to begin decommissioning. An associated system of warning sirens was located in the southeastern part of the county for emergency notification in the event of a problem at the station.

An Atlas missile launch site (Site B), formerly associated with Offutt Air Force Base and deactivated in the 1960s, lies east of Arlington.

==Geography==
Washington County lies on the east side of Nebraska. Its east boundary line abuts the west boundary line of the state of Iowa, across the Missouri River. The Elkhorn River flows southeastward along the county&#x27;s southwest border, and a smaller drainage, the Little Papillon River, flows southward through the center part of the county, discharging into Glenn Cunningham Reservoir south of the county. The county&#x27;s terrain consists of low rolling hills sloping to the east, with several drainage channels eroded into its eastern portion sloping down to the river. The county&#x27;s planar areas are largely devoted to agriculture. The county has an area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water. It is Nebraska&#x27;s fifth-smallest county by area.

==Politics==
Between 1900 and 1936, Washington County was a bellwether county, voting for the winner of the nationwide presidential election until Wendell Willkie won it despite losing nationwide. However, as is the case in most rural counties throughout Nebraska and the rest of America, the county&#x27;s voters have since become reliably Republican from 1940 onward. As of 2020, in only one presidential election since 1936, that being Lyndon Johnon&#x27;s narrow victory in 1964, has the county selected the Democratic Party candidate, and even he was only able to win it by a single point. President Donald Trump received 70% of the county&#x27;s vote in the most recent presidential race, in 2024.

<text>Thurston County is the northeasternmost county in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 6,773. Its county seat is Pender.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Thurston County is represented by the prefix 55 (it had the 55th-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

The Siouan-speaking Omaha and Ho-Chunk have reservations in Thurston County. The two reservations combined comprise the county&#x27;s entire land area.

==History==
Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived along the rivers for hundreds of years before European encounter. The Omaha occupied this territory and much of Nebraska and western Iowa before the Europeans arrived. They had migrated west from the Ohio Valley under pressure from the Iroquois Confederacy in the early 17th century.

Thurston County was organized by European Americans in 1889 from land that had been divided between Dakota and Burt counties since the dissolution of Blackbird County in 1879. It was named for US Senator John M. Thurston.

==Geography==
Thurston County lies on the east side of Nebraska. Its east boundary line abuts the west boundary line of the state of Iowa, across the Missouri River. The west portion of the county is drained by the Logan Creek Drainage, which flows south-southeast. Thurston County has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. The land area of the county is completely comprised from the Omaha and Winnebago Indian reservations.

==Politics==












In recent decades, Native Americans in the United States have become more active politically, voting in increasing numbers in local, state, and national elections. In 2004, Thurston, a majority-Native American county, was the only one in Nebraska with a majority voting for the Democratic Party presidential candidate, John Kerry.

Voter interest was high, and the 2008 presidential election was preceded by a major voter registration drive. The majority of voters in Thurston County voted for Democratic candidate Barack Obama, making the county one of four such in the state. In the 2012 presidential election, Thurston was the only Nebraska county that voted for Obama in his successful re-election bid. In 2016, the county flipped, voting for Republican Donald Trump. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump expanded on his previous performances, carrying it by about 7%.

The predominantly Native American communities in the east of the county (Winnebago, Walthill and Macy) lean Democratic, but despite them having more population altogether than the Republican predominantly white communities in the west of the county, they sport lower voter turnouts.

<text>Seward County is a county in the U.S. state of Nebraska, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 17,609. Its county seat is Seward. The county was formed in 1855, and was organized in 1867. It was originally called Greene County, and in 1862 it was renamed for William H. Seward, Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. Seward County is part of the Lincoln, NE Metropolitan Statistical Area.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Seward County is represented by the prefix 16 (it had the sixteenth-largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922).

==Geography==
The Seward County terrain consists of low rolling hills, largely dedicated to agriculture including center pivot irrigation. The Big Blue River flows south-southeasterly through the central part of the county. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 16,496 people, 6,013 households, and 4,215 families in the county. The population density was . There were 6,428 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 98.05% White, 0.28% Black or African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.29% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.40% from other races, and 0.72% from two or more races. 1.09% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 6,013 households, out of which 32.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.50% were married couples living together, 5.60% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.90% were non-families. 24.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.10% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.04.

The county population contained 24.70% under the age of 18, 14.30% from 18 to 24, 24.60% from 25 to 44, 21.20% from 45 to 64, and 15.20% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.20 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.50 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $42,700, and the median income for a family was $51,813. Males had a median income of $32,218 versus $22,329 for females. The per capita income for the county was $18,379. About 4.10% of families and 7.00% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.20% of those under age 18 and 6.80% of those age 65 or over.

===Civil asset forfeiture===

The county engages in extensive civil asset forfeiture. Having less than 18,000 people, it accounted for at least 90 cases in the last decade, one-third of all civil forfeiture cases in the state during that period and double that of any other Nebraska county. From 2018 to 2023, the county obtained $7.5 million in forfeited cash. Nearly all of the civil forfeitures stem from traffic stops of out-of-state drivers on Interstate 80 where Seward County police give stopped drivers a choice to give up their cash with an &quot;abandonment form&quot; or refuse and be subject to felony charges; the routine seizures never result in convictions of drivers, raising questions about the intent of the forfeitures. This practice continues despite 2016 state law LB 1106, meant to stop it by first requiring a criminal conviction for illegal drugs, child pornography, or illegal gambling, and establishing new reporting requirements and transfer regulations for seizures or forfeitures. However, loopholes in the law still allow seizure during a traffic stop if police believe the cash is connected to drugs, even if no drugs are found in the vehicle, a tactic that is used routinely by Seward County police. A bill introduced in February 2024 by Nebraska legislator Tom Brewer, LB 916, intends to ban civil forfeiture in the state entirely, requiring in all cases that prosecutors use the criminal justice process, rather than civil courts, to seize property.

<text>Scotts Bluff County is a county on the western border of the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 36,084. Its county seat is Gering, and its largest city is Scottsbluff. Scotts Bluff County is included in the Scottsbluff, NE Micropolitan Statistical Area. In the Nebraska license plate system, Scotts Bluff County is represented by the prefix 21, since the county had the twenty-first-largest number of registered vehicles registered when the state&#x27;s license-plate system was established in 1922.

==History==
The county is named for a prominent bluff that served as a landmark for 19th-century pioneers traveling along the Oregon Trail. Scotts Bluff was named for Hiram Scott, a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper who died nearby around 1828. Washington Irving claimed that, after being injured and abandoned, Scott had crawled sixty miles only to perish near the bluff that now bears his name. The bluff is now managed by the National Park Service as Scotts Bluff National Monument.

The town of Gering was founded at the base of the bluff in 1887, and the city of Scottsbluff was founded across the North Platte River in 1900. Joined by the river, the former transportation highway, the two cities now form Nebraska&#x27;s 7th-largest urban area.

<text>Sarpy County is a county located in the U.S. state of Nebraska. As of the 2020 census, the population was 190,604, making it the third-most populous county in Nebraska. Its county seat is Papillion.

Sarpy County is part of the Omaha-Council Bluffs, NE-IA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
This was part of the territory of the Omaha people. Explored in 1805 by the Lewis and Clark expedition following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 by the United States, this area was settled by European-American fur traders, adventurers, farmers, and finally, entrepreneurs. All initially depended on the Missouri River as a main transportation corridor and source of water. Sarpy County has served as the springboard for Nebraska&#x27;s settlement and expansion. The county is named for Peter Sarpy, an early fur trader at Fontenelle&#x27;s Post in the Bellevue area in the 1840s. He also had Sarpy&#x27;s post in what became Decatur; Sarpy died in Plattsmouth in 1865.

The area of present Sarpy County was a part of Douglas County until February 1, 1857, when the Territorial Legislature partitioned off that county&#x27;s southern half and proclaimed it a separate organization.

The Omaha people were forced onto a reservation in the 19th century, losing most of their land to the United States who then opened it for settlement by non-Native Americans who were U.S. citizens or immigrants from certain (mostly European) countries.

Fort Crook, the U.S. Army post south of Bellevue, was established in the 1890s and added Offutt Field in the 1920s. Its Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant produced over two thousand aircraft during World War II, including the notable B-29&#x27;s &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot;. Offutt Air Force Base was the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) during the Cold War and continues as the home of U.S. Strategic Command.

In the Nebraska license plate system, Sarpy County was represented by the prefix &quot;59&quot; (it had the 59th largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922). Many license plates issued in Sarpy County featured the stacked format of the 59 code. The county, just south of Omaha, had grown significantly in population in the decades following 1922 and therefore required five characters rather than the four allowed by a standard double-digit county code. In 2002, the state discontinued the 1922 system in Sarpy as well as Douglas and Lancaster counties.

==Geography==
Sarpy County is bounded on the east by the Missouri River; on the south and west by the Platte River. The county&#x27;s terrain consists of low rolling hills, cut by several small gullies and drainages that move groundwater to one of these rivers. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.4%) is water. Sarpy is the smallest of Nebraska&#x27;s 93 counties.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Sarpy County Sheriff&#x27;s Department is responsible for enforcing the law within the unincorporated areas of the county. By contract, the department is also responsible for enforcing the law within the city limits of Gretna and Springfield. The cities of Bellevue, La Vista, and Papillion have their own city Police Departments which are primarily responsible for law enforcement within their respective city limits. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department has secondary responsibility for law enforcement within these three cities, providing essentials such as backup support.

The Sarpy County Law Enforcement Center, built in 1989, is located within the campus of the Sarpy County Courthouse in Papillion. It houses the county&#x27;s jail facility and the Sarpy County Public Defender&#x27;s Office. The Bellevue and LaVista City Police Departments also have their own holding cells. The county jail was designed to hold 148 people, but the facility frequently holds more than that number.
Fire protection and emergency medical services are provided by a mix of seven full-career, part-time paid, military, and all-volunteer fire departments, representing various municipalities within the county, plus Offutt Air Force Base.

===Politics===
Sarpy County voters have generally voted Republican in national politics. In only one national election since 1948 has the county selected the Democratic Party candidate (as of 2020). Since 1964, only three Democrats - Barack Obama in 2008, Joe Biden in 2020, and Kamala Harris in 2024 have received at least 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. From 1968 to 2016, Republicans always carried Sarpy County by at least 21 points with the exception of a slight drop to 16 points in 2008. However, in 2020, Republican candidate Donald Trump beat Biden only by 11 points, a 92-year low for a winning Republican candidate. In 2024, Sarpy County very narrowly voted for Dan Osborn, an Independent, over incumbent Republican Senator Deb Fischer in the 2024 Senate race; no Democrat filed for this race.

This county was the only one in Nebraska to vote for both Initiative 434 and Initiative 439 in 2024. Those two initiatives dealt with abortion and were contradictory to each other, with the former restricting abortion after the first trimester and the latter intending to protect abortion access through fetal viability.

As of December 2020, Republicans hold a plurality in the county voter registration.
