<text>Godfrey Harold Hardy (7 February 1877 – 1 December 1947) was an English mathematician, known for his achievements in number theory and mathematical analysis. In biology, he is known for the Hardy–Weinberg principle, a basic principle of population genetics.

G. H. Hardy is usually known by those outside the field of mathematics for his 1940 essay &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;, often considered one of the best insights into the mind of a working mathematician written for the layperson.

Starting in 1914, Hardy was the mentor of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, a relationship that has become celebrated. Hardy almost immediately recognised Ramanujan&#x27;s extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, and Hardy and Ramanujan became close collaborators. In an interview by Paul Erdős, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan. In a lecture on Ramanujan, Hardy said that &quot;my association with him is the one romantic incident in my life&quot;.

==Biography==
G. H. Hardy was born on 7 February 1877, in Cranleigh, Surrey, England, into a teaching family. His father was Bursar and Art Master at Cranleigh School; his mother had been a senior mistress at Lincoln Training College for teachers. Both of his parents were mathematically inclined, though neither had a university education. He and his sister Gertrude &quot;Gertie&quot; Emily Hardy (1878–1963) were brought up by their educationally enlightened parents in a typical Victorian nursery attended by a nurse. At an early age, he argued with his nurse about the existence of Santa Claus and the efficacy of prayer. He read aloud to his sister books such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

Hardy&#x27;s own natural affinity for mathematics was perceptible at an early age. When just two years old, he wrote numbers up to millions, and when taken to church he amused himself by factorising the numbers of the hymns.

After schooling at Cranleigh, Hardy was awarded a scholarship to Winchester College for his mathematical work. In 1896, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He was first tutored under Robert Rumsey Webb, but found it unsatisfying, and briefly considered switching to history. He then was tutored by Augustus Love, who recommended him to read Camille Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse&quot;, which taught him for the first time &quot;what mathematics really meant&quot;. After only two years of preparation under his coach, Robert Alfred Herman, Hardy was fourth in the Mathematics Tripos examination. Years later, he sought to abolish the Tripos system, as he felt that it was becoming more an end in itself than a means to an end. While at university, Hardy joined the Cambridge Apostles, an elite, intellectual secret society.

Hardy cited as his most important influence his independent study of &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;École Polytechnique&quot; by the French mathematician Camille Jordan, through which he became acquainted with the more precise mathematics tradition in continental Europe. In 1900 he passed part II of the Tripos, and in the same year he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College. In 1903 he earned his M.A., which was the highest academic degree at English universities at that time. When his Prize Fellowship expired in 1906 he was appointed to the Trinity staff as a lecturer in mathematics, where teaching six hours per week left him time for research.

On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to Hardy, who Ramanujan had known from studying &quot;Orders of Infinity&quot; (1910). Hardy read the letter in the morning, suspected it was a crank or a prank, but thought it over and realized in the evening that it was likely genuine because &quot;great mathematicians are commoner than thieves or humbugs of such incredible skill&quot;. He then invited Ramanujan to Cambridge and began &quot;the one romantic incident in my life&quot;.

In the aftermath of the Bertrand Russell affair during World War I, in 1919 he left Cambridge to take the Savilian Chair of Geometry (and thus become a Fellow of New College) at Oxford. Hardy spent the academic year 1928–1929 at Princeton University in an academic exchange with Oswald Veblen, who spent the year at Oxford. Hardy gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture for 1928. Hardy left Oxford and returned to Cambridge in 1931, becoming again a fellow of Trinity College and holding the Sadleirian Professorship until 1942. It is believed that he left Oxford for Cambridge to avoid the compulsory retirement at 65.

He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1922 to 1935.

In 1939, he suffered a coronary thrombosis, which prevented him from playing tennis, squash, etc. He also lost his creative powers in mathematics. He was constantly bored and distracted himself by writing a privately circulated memoir about the Bertrand Russell affair. In the early summer of 1947, he attempted suicide by barbiturate overdose. After that, he resolved to simply wait for death. He died suddenly one early morning while listening to his sister read out from a book of the history of Cambridge University cricket.

== Work ==
Hardy is credited with reforming British mathematics by bringing rigour into it, which was previously a characteristic of French, Swiss and German mathematics. British mathematicians had remained largely in the tradition of applied mathematics, in thrall to the reputation of Isaac Newton (see Cambridge Mathematical Tripos). Hardy was more in tune with the &quot;cours d&#x27;analyse&quot; methods dominant in France, and aggressively promoted his conception of pure mathematics, in particular against the hydrodynamics that was an important part of Cambridge mathematics.

Hardy preferred to work only 4 hours every day on mathematics, spending the rest of the day talking, playing cricket, and other gentlemanly activities.

From 1911, he collaborated with John Edensor Littlewood, in extensive work in mathematical analysis and analytic number theory. This (along with much else) led to quantitative progress on Waring&#x27;s problem, as part of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method, as it became known. In prime number theory, they proved results and some notable conditional results. This was a major factor in the development of number theory as a system of conjectures; examples are the first and second Hardy–Littlewood conjectures. Hardy&#x27;s collaboration with Littlewood is among the most successful and famous collaborations in mathematical history. In a 1947 lecture, the Danish mathematician Harald Bohr reported a colleague as saying, &quot;Nowadays, there are only three really great English mathematicians: Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy–Littlewood.&quot;

Hardy is also known for formulating the Hardy–Weinberg principle, a basic principle of population genetics, independently from Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908. He played cricket with the geneticist Reginald Punnett, who introduced the problem to him in purely mathematical terms. Hardy, who had no interest in genetics and described the mathematical argument as &quot;very simple&quot;, may never have realised how important the result became.

Hardy was elected an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921, an international member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1927, and an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1939.

Hardy&#x27;s collected papers have been published in seven volumes by Oxford University Press.

===Pure mathematics===

Hardy preferred his work to be considered &quot;pure mathematics&quot;, perhaps because of his detestation of war and the military uses to which mathematics had been applied. He made several statements similar to that in his &quot;Apology&quot;:

However, aside from formulating the Hardy–Weinberg principle in population genetics, his famous work on integer partitions with his collaborator Ramanujan, known as the Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic formula, has been widely applied in physics to find quantum partition functions of atomic nuclei (first used by Niels Bohr) and to derive thermodynamic functions of non-interacting Bose–Einstein systems. Though Hardy wanted his maths to be &quot;pure&quot; and devoid of any application, much of his work has found applications in other branches of science.

Moreover, Hardy deliberately pointed out in his &quot;Apology&quot; that mathematicians generally do not &quot;glory in the uselessness of their work&quot;, but rather – because science can be used for evil ends as well as good – &quot;mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean.&quot; Hardy also rejected as a &quot;delusion&quot; the belief that the difference between pure and applied mathematics had anything to do with their utility. Hardy regards as &quot;pure&quot; the kinds of mathematics that are independent of the physical world, but also considers some &quot;applied&quot; mathematicians, such as the physicists Maxwell and Einstein, to be among the &quot;real&quot; mathematicians, whose work &quot;has permanent aesthetic value&quot; and &quot;is eternal because the best of it may, like the best literature, continue to cause intense emotional satisfaction to thousands of people after thousands of years.&quot; Although he admitted that what he called &quot;real&quot; mathematics may someday become useful, he asserted that, at the time in which the &quot;Apology&quot; was written, only the &quot;dull and elementary parts&quot; of either pure or applied mathematics could &quot;work for good or ill&quot;.

== Personality ==
Hardy was extremely shy as a child and was socially awkward, cold and eccentric throughout his life. During his school years, he was top of his class in most subjects, and won many prizes and awards but hated having to receive them in front of the entire school. He was uncomfortable being introduced to new people, and could not bear to look at his own reflection in a mirror. It is said that, when staying in hotels, he would cover all the mirrors with towels.

Socially, Hardy was associated with the Bloomsbury Group and the Cambridge Apostles; G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and J. M. Keynes were friends. Apart from close friendships, he had a few platonic relationships with young men who shared his sensibilities, and often his love of cricket. A mutual interest in cricket led him to befriend the young C. P. Snow. Hardy was a lifelong bachelor and in his final years he was cared for by his sister.

He was an avid cricket fan. Maynard Keynes observed that if Hardy had read the stock exchange for half an hour every day with as much interest and attention as he did the day&#x27;s cricket scores, he would have become a rich man. He liked to speak of the best class of mathematical research as &quot;the Hobbs class&quot;, and later, after Bradman appeared as an even greater batsman, &quot;the Bradman class&quot;.

Around the age of 20, he decided that he did not believe in God, which proved a minor issue as attending the chapel was compulsory at Cambridge University. He wrote a letter to his parents explaining that, and from then on he refused to go into any college chapel, even for purely ritualistic duties.

He was at times politically involved, if not an activist. He took part in the Union of Democratic Control during World War I, and For Intellectual Liberty in the late 1930s. He admired America and the Soviet Union roughly equally. He found both sides of the Second World War objectionable.

Paul Hoffman writes that &quot;His concerns were wide-ranging, as evidenced by six New Year&#x27;s resolutions he set in a postcard to a friend: prove the Riemann hypothesis; (2) make 211 not out in the fourth innings of the last Test Match at the Oval; (3) find an argument for the nonexistence of God which shall convince the general public; (4) be the first man at the top of Mount Everest; (5) be proclaimed the first president of the U. S. S. R. of Great Britain and Germany; and (6) murder Mussolini.

==Cultural references==
Hardy is a key character, played by Jeremy Irons, in the 2015 film &quot;The Man Who Knew Infinity&quot;, based on the biography of Ramanujan with the same title. Hardy is a major character in David Leavitt&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;The Indian Clerk&quot; (2007), which depicts his Cambridge years and his relationship with John Edensor Littlewood and Ramanujan. Hardy is a secondary character in &quot;Uncle Petros and Goldbach&#x27;s Conjecture&quot; (1992), a mathematics novel by Apostolos Doxiadis. Hardy is also a character in the 2014 Indian film, &quot;Ramanujan&quot;, played by Kevin McGowan.

<text>Robert Charles Durman Mitchum (August 6, 1917 – July 1, 1997) was an American actor. He is known for his antihero roles and film noir appearances. He received nominations for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1984 and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1992. Mitchum is rated number 23 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the greatest male stars of classic American cinema.

Mitchum rose to prominence with an Academy Award nomination for the Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; (1945). His best-known films include &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947), &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1953), &quot;River of No Return&quot; (1954), &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955),&quot; Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison &quot; (1957), &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (1958), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1966), &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970), &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973), and &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1975). He is also known for his television role as U.S. Navy Captain Victor &quot;Pug&quot; Henry in the epic miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983) and sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988).

Film critic Roger Ebert called Mitchum his favorite movie star and the soul of film noir: &quot;With his deep, laconic voice and his long face and those famous weary eyes, he was the kind of guy you&#x27;d picture in a saloon at closing time, waiting for someone to walk in through the door and break his heart.&quot; David Thomson wrote: &quot;Since the war, no American actor has made more first-class films, in so many different moods.&quot;

==Early life==
Robert Charles Durman Mitchum was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on August 6, 1917, into a Methodist family of Scots-Irish, Native American, and Norwegian descent. His father, James Thomas Mitchum, a shipyard and railroad worker, was of Scots-Irish and Native American descent, and his mother, Ann Harriet Gunderson, was a Norwegian immigrant and sea captain&#x27;s daughter. His older sister, Annette (known as Julie Mitchum during her acting career), was born in 1914. James was crushed to death in a railyard accident in Charleston, South Carolina, in February 1919. Ann was pregnant at the time, and was awarded a government pension. She returned to Connecticut after staying for some time in her husband&#x27;s hometown of Lane, South Carolina. Her third child, John, was born in September 1919.

When all of the children were old enough to attend school, Ann found employment as a linotype operator for the &quot;Bridgeport Post&quot;. She married Lieutenant Hugh &quot;The Major&quot; Cunningham Morris, a former Royal Naval Reserve officer. They had a daughter, Carol Morris, born on the family farm in Delaware.

As a child, Mitchum was known as a prankster, often involved in fistfights and mischief. In 1926, his mother sent him and his younger brother to live with her parents on a farm near Woodside, Delaware. He attended Felton High School, where he was expelled for mischief. During his years at the Felton school, he ran away from home for the first time at age 11.
In 1929, Mitchum and his younger brother were sent to Philadelphia to live with their older sister, Julie, who had started her career as a performer in vaudeville acts on the East Coast. The following year, he and the rest of the family moved to New York with Julie, sharing an apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen with her and her husband. Mitchum attended Haaren High School but was eventually expelled.

Mitchum left home at age 14 and traveled throughout the country, hopping freight cars and taking a number of jobs, including ditch digging, fruit picking, and dishwashing. In the summer of 1933, he was arrested for vagrancy in Savannah, Georgia and put in a local chain gang. By Mitchum&#x27;s account, he escaped and hitchhiked to Rising Sun, Delaware, where his family had moved. That fall, at age 16, while recovering from injuries that nearly cost him a leg, he met 14-year-old Dorothy Spence, whom he would later marry. 

Mitchum worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps for a few months, digging ditches and planting trees, before going back on the road in July 1934. He headed for Long Beach, California, where his older sister had moved with her husband. The rest of the family soon also arrived and moved in with Julie. For the next three years, Mitchum continued traveling across the country and taking various jobs. He participated in 27 professional boxing matches but retired from the ring after a fight that broke his nose and left a scar on his left eye.

==Acting career==
===Getting established===


By 1937, Mitchum had settled in Long Beach, California. His older sister, Julie, tried to return to show business and became a member of the Players Guild, a local theater group. Often accompanying her home after her rehearsals, he took an interest in the group&#x27;s productions and became acquainted with her colleagues. With his mother&#x27;s encouragement, Mitchum joined the Players Guild and made his stage debut in August 1937. He continued appearing in their productions and also wrote two children&#x27;s plays. After Julie began working as a cabaret singer, he started writing lyrics for her and other performers. In 1939, he wrote and composed an oratorio that was presented at a Jewish-refugee-benefit show, produced and directed by Orson Welles.

In late 1939, Mitchum was hired by astrologer Carroll Righter as an assistant for an Eastern Seaboard tour. He returned to Delaware to marry Dorothy Spence in 1940 during this trip and then moved back to California with her. He quit his work as a writer for cabaret acts after a promised payment failed to materialize. Intending to provide a steady income for his family after his wife became pregnant, Mitchum took a job as a sheet metal worker at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation during World War II. He acted part-time for a while, and his last stage appearance before his entrance into films was in 1941. The noise of the machinery at Lockheed damaged his hearing. Assigned to a graveyard shift, he suffered from chronic insomnia and went temporarily blind. Told by his doctors that his illness was caused by job-related anxieties, he left Lockheed. 

Mitchum then sought work as a film actor. An agent he knew from his work in theater got him an interview with Harry Sherman, the producer of United Artists&#x27; &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; Western film series, which starred William Boyd. In June 1942, Mitchum began his film career with a part as a minor villain in &quot;Border Patrol&quot;, the first of seven Hopalong Cassidy films he made that were released in 1943. That year, he appeared in a total of 19 films. His first non-Western was &quot;Follow the Band&quot;, a musical at Universal, and he went uncredited as a soldier in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, a major MGM picture starring Mickey Rooney. Other films in which he played supporting parts included a Laurel and Hardy comedy, &quot;The Dancing Masters&quot;, and two war films starring Randolph Scott, &quot;Corvette K-225&quot; and &quot;Gung Ho!&quot;. Harry Cohn offered him a studio contract after viewing his performance in Columbia&#x27;s musical &quot;Doughboys in Ireland&quot;. Mitchum, however, declined the offer.

Mitchum&#x27;s first important role was in &quot;When Strangers Marry&quot;, a thriller directed by William Castle and released by Monogram in 1944. Opposite Dean Jagger and Kim Hunter, he played a salesman who helps his former girlfriend solve a murder mystery. Mitchum received positive reviews for his performance, and in retrospect, the film is considered a fine example of B movies. That same year, he was cast in a small role in the war film &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, starring Van Johnson and Robert Walker and featuring Spencer Tracy in a guest performance. Director Mervyn LeRoy was impressed by Mitchum&#x27;s talent and recommended him to RKO.

On May 25, 1944, Mitchum signed a seven-year contract with RKO at an initial salary of $350 per week, effective June 1. David O. Selznick&#x27;s Vanguard Films bought a piece of the contract. Mitchum&#x27;s first film for RKO was &quot;Girl Rush&quot; (1944), a comedy starring Brown and Carney. He was groomed for B-Western stardom in two Zane Grey adaptations, &quot;Nevada&quot; (1944) and &quot;West of the Pecos&quot; (1945), with the former marking his first time receiving star billing. Both films did well at the box office and received positive reviews from critics.

Following the filming of the two Westerns, RKO lent Mitchum to independent producer Lester Cowan for a prominent supporting actor role in &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; (1945), directed by William A. Wellman. He portrayed a war-weary officer based on Captain Henry T. Waskow, who remains resolute despite the troubles he faces. The film, which followed the life of an ordinary soldier through the eyes of journalist Ernie Pyle, played by Burgess Meredith, became an instant critical and commercial success. General Dwight D. Eisenhower called it the greatest war picture he had ever seen. Before its release, Mitchum was drafted into the United States Army, serving at Fort MacArthur, California, as a medic. &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Mitchum&#x27;s only nomination for an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actor. The film established Mitchum as a star, and nearly three decades later, Andrew Sarris described his performance as &quot;extraordinarily haunting&quot; in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

In 1946, Mitchum appeared in &quot;Till the End of Time&quot;, Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s box office hit about returning Marine veterans, with Dorothy McGuire and Guy Madison, before migrating to a genre that came to define his career and screen persona: film noir.

===Film noir===

Mitchum ultimately became best known for his work in film noir. He was cast as the second lead in two noirs in 1946. On a loan-out to MGM, he costarred with Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Undercurrent&quot;, playing a troubled, sensitive man entangled in the affairs of his tycoon brother and his brother&#x27;s suspicious wife. At RKO, he appeared in John Brahm&#x27;s &quot;The Locket&quot;, playing a bitter ex-boyfriend to Laraine Day&#x27;s femme fatale. The latter, noted for its use of multi-layered flashbacks, has become a cult classic. 

Mitchum&#x27;s career took a significant turn in 1947. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Pursued&quot;, costarring Teresa Wright, playing a character who attempts to recall his past and find those responsible for killing his family. It was his first high-budget Western and is generally considered the first noir Western in American cinema. Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, costarring Robert Young and Robert Ryan, featured Mitchum as a member of a group of returned World War II soldiers embroiled in a murder investigation for an act committed by an anti-semite in their ranks. With a modest budget, the picture became RKO&#x27;s most profitable film of 1947 and earned five Academy Award nominations. &quot;Desire Me&quot;, a loan-out to MGM, costarring Greer Garson, was Mitchum&#x27;s least successful film of the year. A troubled production and box office disaster, it is often cited as the first major Hollywood film released without a credited director.

Following the success of &quot;Pursued&quot; and &quot;Crossfire&quot;, Mitchum was signed to a new seven-year contract with RKO and David O. Selznick, which immediately increased his salary from $1,500 to $3,000 per week. He rounded out 1947 with &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (also known as &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot;), landing his first starring role in a major RKO production. Directed by Jacques Tourneur, costarring Jane Greer and Kirk Douglas, and featuring the cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca, the picture cast Mitchum as a small-town gas-station owner and former private investigator whose unfinished business with a gambler and a femme fatale comes back to haunt him. RKO leaders, who were initially unimpressed with the finished film, were surprised to see it become a moderate success at the box office. Mitchum received generally favorable reviews for his performance, with &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Bosley Crowther finding him &quot;magnificently cheeky and self-assured.&quot; The film&#x27;s reception solidified his status as a leading man at his home studio. Today, &quot;Out of the Past&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all film noirs, featuring Mitchum in his signature role as the genre&#x27;s fatalistic anti-hero.

On September 1, 1948, during the rise of his career, Mitchum was arrested for possession of marijuana with actress Lila Leeds. While RKO could have cited the morals clause and canceled his contract, the studio chose to stand by him. He served for 50 days, split between the Los Angeles County Jail and a Castaic, California, prison farm, and was released on March 30, 1949. &quot;Life&quot; photographers were permitted to take photos of him mopping up in his prison uniform. He later told reporters that jail was &quot;like Palm Springs, but without the riff-raff.&quot; Mitchum&#x27;s conviction was later overturned by the Los Angeles court and district attorney&#x27;s office on January 31, 1951, after being exposed as a setup.

Despite Mitchum&#x27;s legal troubles, his popularity was not harmed. His upcoming film, &quot;Rachel and the Stranger&quot;, was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity surrounding the arrest and became one of RKO&#x27;s top grossers of 1948. Costarring with Loretta Young and William Holden, he played a mountain man competing for the hand of the indentured servant and wife of a recent widower. That same year, he appeared in Robert Wise&#x27;s noir Western &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; with Barbara Bel Geddes, playing a cowboy caught in a conflict between cattle owners and homesteaders. His performance received rave reviews, with critics noting his screen image as a quiet yet menacing drifter and pointing out that his presence enhanced the film&#x27;s quality.

Mitchum starred in three films in 1949. &quot;The Red Pony&quot;, the film adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novella, directed by Lewis Milestone and costarring Myrna Loy, was his first color film. A loan-out to Republic Pictures, it featured him as a trusted cowhand to a ranching family. Back at RKO in
&quot;The Big Steal&quot;, an early Don Siegel film, he returned to film noir in a reunion with Jane Greer, playing an army lieutenant who chases a thief with the help of the thief&#x27;s fiancée. It was a box office success. He was cast against type in the romantic comedy &quot;Holiday Affair&quot; opposite Janet Leigh. Although the film failed at the box office at the time, it is now identified as a Christmas classic with annual showings on television.

By the end of the 1940s, Mitchum had become RKO&#x27;s biggest star. Before the filming of &quot;Holiday Affair&quot;, RKO studio head Howard Hughes bought Selznick&#x27;s share of his contract for $400,000.

===Mainstream stardom in the 1950s and 1960s===


Mitchum appeared in a string of film noirs in the early 1950s. In &quot;Where Danger Lives&quot; (1950), he played a doctor who comes between a mentally unbalanced Faith Domergue and a cuckolded Claude Rains. The film received mixed reviews from critics. He and Ava Gardner played star-crossed lovers in &quot;My Forbidden Past&quot; (1951), a box office flop. The script was so disappointing that he publicly complained about it during the making of the film. The next three films he starred in were all troubled productions. &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951) starred Mitchum as a down-on-his-luck gambler lured to a Mexican resort by mobsters and paired him for the first time with Jane Russell, RKO&#x27;s top female star at the time. Richard Fleischer was brought on by Howard Hughes for extensive reshooting of John Farrow&#x27;s original cut. &quot;The Racket&quot; (1951), a noir remake of the 1928 silent crime drama of the same name, featured him as a police captain fighting corruption in his precinct. Four other directors contributed to the project alongside the credited John Cromwell. &quot;Macao&quot; (1952) reunited him with Russell, casting him as a victim of mistaken identity at an exotic resort casino. Director Josef von Sternberg was forced off the set by Hughes and replaced by Nicholas Ray. While &quot;The Racket&quot; was one of RKO&#x27;s most successful films of 1951, both &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; and &quot;Macao&quot; cost so much that they lost money. 

Following the Korean War drama &quot;One Minute to Zero&quot; (1952) with Ann Blyth, which was one of RKO&#x27;s biggest pictures of the year, Mitchum returned to the Western genre. He starred as a veteran rodeo champion in &quot;The Lusty Men&quot; (also 1952), directed by Nicholas Ray and costarring Susan Hayward and Arthur Kennedy. His performance was lauded by critics, with &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling it his best to date. Manny Farber wrote in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Mitchum is the most convincing cowboy I&#x27;ve seen in horse opry, meeting every situation with the lonely, distant calm of a master cliché-dodger.&quot;

In 1953, Mitchum starred in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Angel Face&quot;, the first of his three films with Jean Simmons. He played an ambulance driver who allows a murderously insane heiress to fatally seduce him. The initial reviews were mixed, but the film is now recognized as a noir classic. Jean-Luc Godard named it as one of the best ten American sound pictures. In a retrospective review in 2010, Richard Brody wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;the ever-cool Mitchum radiates heat without warmth.&quot; 

In exchange for Hayward&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Lusty Men&quot;, Mitchum was loaned to 20th Century Fox for &quot;White Witch Doctor&quot; (1953) opposite Hayward, playing a hunter who falls in love with a nurse in Africa. Although director Henry Hathaway was impressed by Mitchum&#x27;s performance, the critics were not. Back at RKO, Mitchum appeared in the studio&#x27;s first 3-D production, &quot;Second Chance&quot; (also 1953), playing a boxer whose girlfriend is trailed by a mobster in Mexico. The film, directed by Rudolph Maté and costarring Linda Darnell and Jack Palance, was a box office success and received fairly positive reviews. However, Mitchum had not liked the script and was increasingly dissatisfied with the projects assigned to him by RKO.

In 1954, Mitchum reteamed with Simmons in the romantic comedy &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot;, his last film released by RKO. It was often considered the studio&#x27;s failed attempt to revive the screwball genre. That same year, he was loaned out for two films. At 20th Century Fox, he costarred with Marilyn Monroe in Preminger&#x27;s Western&quot; River of No Return&quot;, which was a box office hit. In William A. Wellman&#x27;s psychological drama &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; for Wayne/Fellows Productions, John Wayne&#x27;s independent production company, he played the bullying brother of Teresa Wright and Tab Hunter. Mitchum recalled the film, which was shot in the deep snow at Mount Rainier, as his toughest location shooting experience. The film was not a success on release, which Wellman described in his autobiography as &quot;a flop artistically, financially, and Wellmanly.&quot; However, it is now recognized as a unique masterpiece by some critics, noted for its color-drained visual style, the story that evokes Eugene O&#x27;Neill and Carl Theodor Dreyer, and Mitchum&#x27;s menacing performance.

Mitchum left RKO after his contract expired on August 15, 1954. 

As a freelancer, Mitchum appeared in three films in 1955. The first was Stanley Kramer&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; costarring Olivia de Havilland and Frank Sinatra, in which he starred as an idealistic young doctor who marries an older nurse only to question his morality many years later. The picture was one of the ten highest-grossing films of the year, but critical reactions were mixed, with Leslie Halliwell pointing out that all of the actors were too old for their characters.

Mitchum&#x27;s second film in 1955 was &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, Charles Laughton&#x27;s only film as a director. Based on a novel by Davis Grubb, the noir thriller starred Mitchum as a serial killer posing as a preacher to find money hidden by his cellmate in the man&#x27;s home. A commercial failure on release, the film is now widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Mitchum&#x27;s performance as Preacher Harry Powell is considered by many one of the best of his career, and the image of him with the words &quot;HATE&quot; and &quot;LOVE&quot; tattooed on his knuckles has left an enduring impact on popular culture, frequently referenced in various media. In a 1985 review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Dave Kehr described the Preacher as &quot;the role that most fully exploits his [Mitchum&#x27;s] ferocious sexuality.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 1996, &quot;Nobody who has seen &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; has forgotten it, or Mitchum&#x27;s voice coiling down those basement stairs: &#x27;Chillll... dren?&#x27;&quot;

Before accepting the lead in the Western &quot;Man with the Gun&quot;, his final release of 1955, Mitchum made headlines for having been fired from &quot;Blood Alley&quot; (1955) at the request of director William A. Wellman. Reportedly, he had thrown the film&#x27;s transportation manager into San Francisco Bay, a story he denied. Producer John Wayne eventually took the role himself.

On March 8, 1955, Mitchum formed DRM Productions, named after his and his wife&#x27;s initials, and signed a five-film deal with United Artists; four ultimately were produced. The first was &quot;Bandido&quot;, in which he played an American adventurer who sides with the rebels and is attracted to the wife of a gunrunner working for the army during the Mexican revolution. A commercial success, it was his second film released in 1956, following the poorly received color noir &quot;Foreign Intrigue&quot;.

Mitchum made two films back to back in Trinidad and Tobago that were released in 1957. John Huston&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; cast him as a Marine corporal stranded on a Pacific Island with a nun, played by Deborah Kerr, as his sole companion, until Japanese soldiers arrive and establish a base. In this character study, they struggle with the elements, the garrison, and their growing feelings for one another. It was the first of his four films with Kerr, his favorite leading lady. Their performances and chemistry were praised by critics, many of whom highlighted the tenderness he brought to his character. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. For his role, Mitchum was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor. In Robert Parrish&#x27;s &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, he and Jack Lemmon played two tramp boat owners in the Caribbean whose friendship is challenged when passenger Rita Hayworth arrives on the scene. The film received mixed reviews and failed at the box office. 

Mitchum appeared in one more film in 1957, Dick Powell&#x27;s World War II submarine film &quot;The Enemy Below&quot;, in which he played the captain of a US Navy destroyer who matches wits with a wily German U-boat skipper, portrayed by Curt Jurgens. The following year, he starred in his second DRM production, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;. The film was loosely based on an incident in which a driver transporting moonshine was said to have fatally crashed on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, somewhere between Bearden Hill and Morrell Road. According to &quot;Metro Pulse&quot; writer Jack Renfro, the incident occurred in 1952 and may have been witnessed by James Agee, who passed the story on to Mitchum. He produced, co-wrote the screenplay for, and is rumored to have directed much of the film, which featured his son James playing his younger brother. He also co-wrote the theme song, &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road,&quot; with Don Raye. The film was frequently shown in drive-in and third-house theaters in the 1960s and has since earned the reputation as the definitive road movie, with a particularly significant following in the South. According to Geoff Andrew in his review for &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot; stands out for &quot;a stunningly laconic performance from Mitchum, white-hot night-time road scenes, and an affectionate but unsentimental vision of backwoods America.&quot;

Mitchum followed &quot;Thunder Road&quot; with his second film directed by Dick Powell, &quot;The Hunters&quot; (1958), in which he played a flying ace who is smitten with the wife of a pilot under his command during the Korean War. He was initially offered the role of Colonel Dean Hess in another Korean War drama, &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; (1957), but the casting choice was vetoed by Hess himself, who cited Mitchum&#x27;s marijuana scandal. In 1959, Mitchum appeared in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Angry Hills&quot; as an American war correspondent entrusted with a list of Greek resistance leaders during World War II, before starring in his third DRM production, &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot;. Opposite Julie London, he portrayed an American expatriate gunslinger in Mexico who returns to the States for an arms deal and falls for the wife of an army major. Largely ignored by audiences and critics at the time, the film is now more highly regarded. Mitchum&#x27;s performance is considered by some critics one of his best and most overlooked.

Mitchum starred in four films in 1960. In Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Home from the Hill&quot;, opposite Eleanor Parker, he played the intimidating, philandering patriarch of a powerful Texan family. The film opened to positive reviews, and modern critics have cited it as one of Minnelli&#x27;s masterpieces and highly praised Mitchum&#x27;s performance. He and Kerr were reunited for Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;The Sundowners&quot;, playing an Australian husband and wife struggling in the sheep industry during the Depression. The film was hailed for its freshness and warmth and received five Academy Awards nominations. Mitchum&#x27;s performance was universally acclaimed, with &quot;Variety&quot; commenting that he &quot;projects a great deal of feeling with what appears to be a minimum of effort.&quot; &quot;The Night Fighters&quot; (also known as &quot;A Terrible Beauty&quot;), his last DRM production, cast him as an IRA member who becomes disillusioned with the organization during World War II. He was teamed with former leading ladies Kerr and Simmons, as well as Cary Grant, for Stanley Donen&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot;, playing an American millionaire who seduces a British countess. While &quot;The Night Fighters&quot; and &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot; were commercial and critical failures, Mitchum earned the year&#x27;s National Board of Review award for Best Actor for his performances in &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; and &quot;The Sundowners&quot;.

After moving to a farm in Talbot County, Maryland, with his family in 1959, Mitchum developed a new passion for quarter horse breeding and, for the next several years, gradually became indifferent to selecting his films, also losing interest in his work as a producer. He renamed DRM Productions as Talbot Productions after his new home county. He stated that it had since become only a &quot;co-production&quot; company and that he had never really produced any of his own films again. 

Mitchum turned down John Huston&#x27;s Western &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), claiming that he did not like the script and had found Huston too demanding during their last collaboration, &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison.&quot; Instead, he starred as Arch Hall Sr. in &quot;The Last Time I Saw Archie&quot; (1961), a service comedy directed by Jack Webb. While he received some positive reviews for his comedic performance, the film went unnoticed at the box office. He would often call it his favorite film, pointing out that he was paid $400,000 for just four weeks&#x27; work and had time off to go home for Christmas and New Year&#x27;s.

In 1962, Mitchum costarred with Gregory Peck in &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, playing an ex-convict seeking revenge on the attorney who testified against him. His performance brought him further renown for playing cold, predatory characters. However, the film itself received mixed reviews, with some critics citing its lack of engaging storytelling; it also failed at the box office. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Mitchum delivered the &quot;cheekiest, wickedest arrogance and the most relentless aura of sadism that he has ever managed to generate&quot; while noting the disgust and regret provoked by the film itself. Jonathan Rosenbaum commented in 2006 that the film&#x27;s &quot;only classic credentials are a terrifying performance by Robert Mitchum and a Bernard Herrmann score.&quot; Mitchum followed &quot;Cape Fear&quot; with &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, joining the international ensemble cast of the epic war film about the D-Day landings in Normandy. He portrayed General Norman Cota, rallying demoralized troops and blasting a path from Omaha Beach. The film opened to generally positive reviews, was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two, and went on to become the highest-grossing film in the domestic market among 1962 releases. Mitchum&#x27;s performance was highlighted by critics. 

Mitchum&#x27;s next five films received mostly negative reviews. He was considered miscast as an indecisive lawyer in Robert Wise&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; (1962), opposite Shirley MacLaine. Two years after turning down &quot;The Misfits&quot;, he appeared in a cameo in Huston&#x27;s &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963), regarded as one of the director&#x27;s weaker efforts. &quot;Rampage&quot; (1963), an adventure film shot in Hawaii that he made for a family vacation, starred him opposite Elsa Martinelli and Jack Hawkins as a big-game trapper vying for the affections of a hunter&#x27;s girlfriend during an expedition to capture a tiger-leopard hybrid. It was viewed as either absurd or dull by critics. Guy Hamilton&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; (1964) cast him as a defense attorney, with his performance perceived as lethargic. He was reunited with MacLaine as one of her all-star husbands in the comedy &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot;. It was one of the ten highest-grossing films of the year, but critics found it disjointed and overlong.

In 1965, Mitchum starred in &quot;Mister Moses&quot;, opposite Carroll Baker, as a diamond smuggler in Africa who is mistaken for a modern-day Moses and trusted by a tribe to lead them to a promised land. Mitchum, usually reluctant to participate in publicity events, undertook an extensive tour to promote the film at distributor United Artists&#x27; request, stating that he believed it was &quot;a pretty good picture.&quot; The reviews were fairly positive, with critics noting his casual charm. 

Following the release of &quot;Mister Moses&quot;, Mitchum revealed in interviews that he might leave Maryland with his family. While he enjoyed the privacy the farm provided, the challenging weather conditions and his wife&#x27;s feelings of isolation eventually prompted their return to Los Angeles, a move he recalled as the right decision given his film commitments. During this time, he went on two USO tours to Vietnam.

Mitchum returned to the Western genre with two releases in 1967. While the epic &quot;The Way West&quot; with Kirk Douglas and Richard Widmark turned out to be a critical and commercial disappointment, &quot;El Dorado&quot; with John Wayne was a major success. The film, considered a quasi-remake of director Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), cast Mitchum as a drunken sheriff who, together with his gunslinger friend, helps a rancher fight a corrupt land baron. At the time of filming, rumors about Mitchum&#x27;s professional attitude, Wayne&#x27;s health, and Hawks&#x27;s age raised doubts about the film&#x27;s prospects. However, it became a box office hit domestically and internationally. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it Hawks&#x27;s best film since &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Howard Thompson described Mitchum&#x27;s performance as &quot;simply wonderful,&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kevin Thomas wrote, &quot;Mitchum delivered one of the loveliest hangover sequences on record.&quot;

Over the next two years, Mitchum appeared in six films that received mixed to poor reviews. The Western &quot;Villa Rides&quot; (1968) cast him alongside Yul Brynner&#x27;s Pancho Villa as a soldier of fortune, a portrayal that critics felt suffered from a weak script. Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s World War II epic &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968) starred him as a cynical war correspondent, with the directing and acting considered uninspired by many. He turned down &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969), stating that he did not want to work with director Sam Peckinpah. Instead, he costarred with Dean Martin in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;5 Card Stud&quot; (1968), again playing a homicidal preacher. The reviews of his performance were generally favorable, but the film was deemed formulaic. Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; (1968), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Mia Farrow and featuring him in a guest appearance as an incestuous stepfather, polarized critics. Mitchum rounded out the decade with two Westerns directed by Burt Kennedy. &quot;Young Billy Young&quot; (1969) with Angie Dickinson was coldly received, while &quot;The Good Guys and the Bad Guys&quot; (1969) with George Kennedy was praised by some for its balance of drama and comedy.

===1970s===
Mitchum made a departure from his typical screen persona with the 1970 David Lean film &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, in which he starred as Charles Shaughnessy, a mild-mannered schoolmaster in World War I–era Ireland. At the time of filming, Mitchum was considering retiring from acting and was also concerned about the film&#x27;s demanding schedule. He initially turned down the script but eventually accepted the role after screenwriter Robert Bolt approached him again. Though the film was nominated for four Academy Awards (winning two) and Mitchum was much publicized as a contender for a Best Actor nomination, he was not nominated. George C. Scott won the award for his powerful performance in &quot;Patton&quot;, a project Mitchum had rejected. Mitchum said that &quot;Patton&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, another picture he turned down, were movies he would not do for any amount of money because he disagreed with the morality of the scripts.

The 1970s featured Mitchum mainly in crime dramas, to mixed result. &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973) had the actor playing an aging Boston hoodlum caught between the Feds and his criminal friends. Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;The Yakuza&quot; (1974) transplanted the typical film noir story arc to the Japanese underworld. Mitchum&#x27;s stint as an aging Philip Marlowe in the Raymond Chandler adaptation &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1975) (a remake of 1944&#x27;s &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;) was sufficiently well received by audiences and critics for him to reprise the role in 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, a remake of the 1946 film of the same title.

Mitchum also appeared in 1976&#x27;s &quot;Midway&quot; about the crucial World War II naval battle.

===Later work===
In 1982, Mitchum played Coach Delaney in the film adaptation of playwright/actor Jason Miller&#x27;s 1973 Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;That Championship Season&quot;.

Mitchum starred in the 1983 miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, based on a Herman Wouk book of the same title. The big-budget production aired on ABC, starring Mitchum as naval officer &quot;Pug&quot; Henry and Victoria Tennant as Pamela Tudsbury, and examined the events leading up to America&#x27;s involvement in World War II. It was watched by 140 million people over seven days and became the most-watched miniseries up to that point. He returned to the role in the 1988 sequel miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, which continued the story through the end of the war.

In 1984, Mitchum entered the Betty Ford Center in Palm Springs, California, for treatment of alcoholism.

He played George Hazard&#x27;s father-in-law in the 1985 miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;, which also aired on ABC.

Mitchum starred opposite Wilford Brimley in the 1986 made-for-TV movie &quot;Thompson&#x27;s Run&quot;.

In 1987, Mitchum was the guest host on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he played private eye Philip Marlowe for the last time in the parody sketch &quot;Death Be Not Deadly.&quot; The show ran a short comedy film he made (written and directed by his daughter, Petrine) called &quot;Out of Gas&quot;, a mock sequel to &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (Jane Greer reprised her role from the original film). He also was in Richard Donner&#x27;s 1988 comedy &quot;Scrooged&quot;.

In 1991, Mitchum was set to receive a lifetime achievement award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. He rejected it, however, after learning that he would have to pay for his own transport and accommodations and accept it in person. That same year, he received the Telegatto award and, in 1992 the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the Golden Globe Awards.

Mitchum continued to appear in films until the mid-1990s, such as Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&quot;, and he narrated the Western &quot;Tombstone&quot;. Though he portrayed the antagonist in the original, he played the protagonist police detective in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, but the actor gradually slowed his workload. His last film appearance was a small but pivotal role in the television biographical film &quot;James Dean: Race with Destiny&quot;, playing &quot;Giant&quot; director George Stevens. Mitchum&#x27;s last starring role was in the 1995 Norwegian movie &quot;Pakten&quot;.

==Music==

One of the lesser-known aspects of Mitchum&#x27;s career was his foray into music as a singer. Critic Greg Adams writes, &quot;Unlike most celebrity vocalists, Robert Mitchum actually had musical talent.&quot; Frank Sinatra said of Mitchum, &quot;For anyone who&#x27;s not a professional musician, he knows more about music, from Bach to Brubeck, than any man I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

Mitchum&#x27;s voice was often used instead of that of a professional singer when his character sang in his films. Notable productions featuring Mitchum&#x27;s own singing voice included &quot;Pursued&quot;, &quot;Rachel and the Stranger&quot;, &quot;One Minute to Zero&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Sundowners&quot;, and &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot;. He sang the title song to &quot;Young Billy Young and River of No Return&quot;.

Mitchum recorded two albums. After hearing traditional calypso music and meeting artists such as Mighty Sparrow and Lord Melody while filming &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; and &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; in the Caribbean islands of Tobago, he recorded &quot;Calypso – is like so ...&quot;. On the album, released through Capitol Records in March 1957, he emulated the calypso sound and style, even adopting the style&#x27;s unique pronunciations and slang. A year later, he recorded &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot;, a song he had written for the film &quot;Thunder Road&quot;. The country-style song became a modest hit for Mitchum, reaching number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart in September 1958. The song was included as a bonus track on a successful reissue of &quot;Calypso ...&quot;

Although Mitchum continued to use his singing voice in his film work, he waited until 1967 to record his follow-up record, &quot;That Man, Robert Mitchum, Sings&quot;. The album, released by Nashville-based Monument Records, took him further into country music and featured songs similar to &quot;The Ballad of Thunder Road&quot;. &quot;Little Old Wine Drinker Me&quot;, the first single, was a top-10 hit on country radio, reaching number nine there, and crossed over into mainstream radio, where it peaked at number 96. Its follow-up, &quot;You Deserve Each Other&quot;, also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Singles chart. Mitchum was nominated for an Academy of Country Music Award for Most Promising Male Vocalist in 1968.

===Albums===
===Singles===
==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
In the fall of 1933, at the age of 16, Mitchum met his future wife, 14-year-old Dorothy Spence, at a swimming hole near Camden, Delaware. She was a schoolmate of his younger brother, John, whom she had briefly dated. Mitchum immediately fell for her, and the two had begun a serious relationship by the time he left for California in 1934. Meanwhile, she continued attending school in Delaware and then went to college in Philadelphia. 

Mitchum married Dorothy on March 16, 1940, in the kitchen of a Methodist parson in Dover, Delaware. He brought her to Los Angeles to settle down, where he took a job at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation before finding work as a film actor in June 1942. The couple had three children: sons, James (born May 8, 1941) and Christopher (born October 16, 1943), both actors; and a daughter, Petrine (born March 3, 1952), a writer.

Despite his reported affairs with other women, including author Edna O&#x27;Brien and actresses Lucille Ball, Ava Gardner, Jean Simmons, Shirley MacLaine, and Sarah Miles, Mitchum and wife Dorothy remained together until his death in 1997. He told journalist Don Short in a 1977 interview: &quot;Not as though there has been anyone else in my life except Dorothy. There&#x27;s not one of &#x27;em—and I&#x27;ve met the best of &#x27;em—worth lighting a candle for alongside her.&quot;

Mitchum&#x27;s grandson Bentley Mitchum is an actor. His great-granddaughter Grace Van Dien is an actress.

===Friendships===
Mitchum&#x27;s close friends included Jane Russell, his neighbor in Santa Barbara, California; and Deborah Kerr, his favorite costar.

===Political views===
Mitchum was a Republican who campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. Mitchum supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George H. W. Bush in 1992, narrating a promotional film for the latter that played at the Republican National Convention.

===Religion===
Although he was born into a Methodist family and later married by a Methodist parson, Mitchum was non-religious.

==Death==
A lifelong heavy smoker, Mitchum died in his sleep at 5 a.m. on July 1, 1997, at his home in Santa Barbara, California, from complications of lung cancer and emphysema. His wife of 57 years, Dorothy, was by his side.

Mitchum&#x27;s body was cremated and, on July 6, his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean off the coast near his home. The private ceremony was attended by only his family members and his longtime friend Jane Russell. There is a cenotaph to him in his wife&#x27;s family plot at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Camden, Delaware. Mitchum&#x27;s wife, Dorothy, died on April 23, 2014, at age 94. In accordance with the couple&#x27;s wishes, her ashes were also scattered at sea so that they could be symbolically reunited at Easter Island.

== Controversies ==
At the 1982 premiere for &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, an intoxicated Mitchum assaulted a female reporter and threw a basketball that he was holding (a prop from the film) at a female photographer from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, causing a neck injury and knocking out two of her teeth. She sued him for $30 million in damages. The suit eventually &quot;cost him his salary from the film&quot;.

Mitchum&#x27;s role in &quot;That Championship Season&quot; may have indirectly contributed to another incident several months later. In a February 1983 &quot;Esquire&quot; interview, he made statements that some construed as racist, antisemitic, and sexist. When asked if the Holocaust had occurred, Mitchum responded, &quot;so the Jews say.&quot; Following the widespread negative response, he apologized a month later, saying that his statements were &quot;prankish&quot; and &quot;foreign to my principle.&quot; He claimed that the problem had begun when he recited a purportedly racist monologue from his role in &quot;That Championship Season&quot; and the reporter believed that the words were Mitchum&#x27;s. He claimed that he had only reluctantly agreed to the interview and then proceeded to &quot;string... along&quot; the reporter with his statements.

==Reception, acting style, and legacy==
Mitchum is regarded by some critics as one of the finest actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood. David Thomson hailed Mitchum as one of the three &quot;most important actors in film history&quot; along with Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck. Appraising Mitchum’s career, Thomson wrote: &quot;Since the war, no American actor has made more first-class films, in so many different moods.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote:
Robert Mitchum was my favorite movie star because he represented, for me, the impenetrable mystery of the movies. He knew the inside story. With his deep, laconic voice and his long face and those famous weary eyes, he was the kind of guy you&#x27;d picture in acit saloon at closing time, waiting for someone to walk in through the door and break his heart.Mitchum was the soul of film noir. 
Mitchum, however, was self-effacing; in an interview with Barry Norman for the BBC about his contribution to cinema, Mitchum stopped Norman in mid-flow and in his typical nonchalant style, said, &quot;Look, I have two kinds of acting. One on a horse and one off a horse. That&#x27;s it.&quot; He had also succeeded in annoying some of his fellow actors by voicing his puzzlement at those who viewed the profession as challenging and hard work.
He possessed a photographic memory that allowed him to remember lines with relative ease, and was also known for his proficiency with accents.

Director Robert Wise recalled that during the shooting of &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot;, Mitchum would mark his script with the letters &quot;NAR,&quot; which meant &quot;no action required.&quot; He told Wise that he did not need a line and would give Wise a look instead. Dismissive of Method acting, when asked by George Peppard if he had studied it during filming of &quot;Home from the Hill&quot;, Mitchum jokingly responded that he had studied the &quot;Smirnoff method&quot;.

Mitchum&#x27;s subtle and understated acting style sometimes garnered him criticism of sleepwalking through his performances in the early stage of his career. In his contemporary review of &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, James Agee commented that Mitchum&#x27;s &quot;curious languor&quot; in love scenes suggested &quot;Bing Crosby supersaturated with barbiturates.&quot; The review of &quot;Where Danger Lives&quot; in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; in 1951 said, &quot;Robert Mitchum performs somnambulistically.&quot; David Thomson noticed that Mitchum &quot;began to attract respectable attention&quot; around the late 1950s. Writing for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; in 1973, Andrew Sarris pointed out that Mitchum, with his stoic presence on the screen that was &quot;mistaken for a stone face without feelings,&quot; had been &quot;grossly maligned as an actor,&quot; while he was actually &quot;reborn in every movie, recreated in every relationship.&quot;

Mitchum had a solid reputation among the directors who worked with him. William A. Wellman thought Mitchum should have won the Academy Award for &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; and called him &quot;one of the finest, most solid and real actors&quot; in the world. Raoul Walsh recalled that Mitchum had impressed him as being &quot;one of the finest natural actors&quot; he had ever met. Charles Laughton, who directed him in &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, considered him to be one of the best actors in the world and believed that he would have been the greatest Macbeth. John Huston felt that Mitchum was on the same pedestal of actors such as Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Laurence Olivier. Vincente Minnelli wrote that few actors he had worked with brought &quot;so much of themselves to a picture,&quot; and none did it &quot;with such total lack of affectation&quot; as he did. Howard Hawks praised Mitchum for being a hard worker, labeling the actor a &quot;fraud&quot; for pretending to not care about acting. David Lean said of him: &quot;He is a master of stillness. Other actors act. Mitchum is. He has true delicacy and expressiveness, but his forte is his indelible identity. Simply by being there, Mitchum can make almost any other actor look like a hole in the screen.&quot;

Jane Greer, his co-star in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; and &quot;The Big Steal&quot;, said of him: &quot;Bob would never be caught acting. He just is.&quot;

Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, Michael Madsen, and Mark Rylance have cited Mitchum as one of their favorite actors.

AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Stars ranked Mitchum as the 23rd-greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema. AFI also recognized Max Cady and Reverend Harry Powell as the 28th and 29th greatest screen villains of all time in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.

For his contribution to the film industry, Mitchum has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6240 Hollywood Boulevard. He was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in 2013.

Mitchum provided the voice of the famous American Beef Council commercials that touted &quot;Beef ... it&#x27;s what&#x27;s for dinner&quot;, from 1992 until his death.

A &quot;Mitchum&#x27;s Steakhouse&quot; operated in Trappe, Maryland, where Mitchum and his family lived from 1959 to 1965.

On December 10, 2022, a historical marker commemorating Mitchum was unveiled in his father&#x27;s hometown of Lane, South Carolina.

<doc id="87606" wikidata="Q817138" url="?curid=87606" title="Electronica">
<text>Electronica is both a broad group of electronic-based music styles intended for listening rather than strictly for dancing and a music scene that came to prominence in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the term is mostly used to refer to electronic music generally.

== History ==
=== Early 1990s: Origins and UK scene ===
The original widespread use of the term &quot;electronica&quot; derives from the influential English experimental techno label New Electronica, which was one of the leading forces of the early 1990s introducing and supporting dance-based electronic music oriented towards home listening rather than dance-floor play, although the word &quot;electronica&quot; had already begun to be associated with synthesizer generated music as early as 1983, when a &quot;UK Electronica Festival&quot; was first held. At that time electronica became known as &quot;electronic listening music&quot;, also becoming more or less synonymous to ambient techno and intelligent techno, and was considered distinct from other emerging genres such as jungle and trip hop.

Electronica artists that would later become commercially successful began to record in the late 1980s, before the term had come into common usage, including for example the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, the Chemical Brothers, the Crystal Method, Moby, Underworld and Faithless.

=== Mid-1990s: Effect on mainstream popular music ===
Around the mid-1990s, with the success of the big beat-sound exemplified by the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy in the UK, and spurred by the attention from mainstream artists, including Madonna in her collaboration with William Orbit on her album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and Australian singer Dannii Minogue with her 1997 album &quot;Girl&quot;, music of this period began to be produced with a higher budget, increased technical quality, and with more layers than most other forms of dance music, since it was backed by major record labels and MTV as the &quot;next big thing&quot;.

According to a 1997 &quot;Billboard&quot; article, &quot;the union of the club community and independent labels&quot; provided the experimental and trend-setting environment in which electronica acts developed and eventually reached the mainstream. It cites American labels such as Astralwerks (the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, the Future Sound of London, Fluke), Moonshine (DJ Keoki), Sims, and City of Angels (the Crystal Method) for playing a significant role in discovering and marketing artists who became popularized in the electronica scene.

Madonna and Björk are said to be responsible for electronica&#x27;s thrust into mainstream culture, with their albums &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (Madonna), &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Homogenic&quot; (Björk).

=== Late 1990s: American inclusion ===
In 1997, the North American mainstream music industry adopted and to some extent manufactured &quot;electronica&quot; as an umbrella term encompassing styles such as techno, big beat, drum and bass, trip hop, downtempo, and ambient, regardless of whether it was curated by indie labels catering to the &quot;underground&quot; nightclub and rave scenes, or licensed by major labels and marketed to mainstream audiences as a commercially viable alternative to alternative rock music.

New York City became one center of experimentation and growth for the electronica sound, with DJs and music producers from areas as diverse as Southeast Asia and Brazil bringing their creative work to the nightclubs of that city.

==Characteristics and definition==
Electronica benefited from industry advancements in music technology, especially electronic musical instruments, synthesizers, music sequencers, drum machines, and digital audio workstations. As the technology developed, it became possible for individuals or smaller groups to produce electronic songs and recordings in smaller studios, even in project studios. At the same time, computers facilitated the use of music &quot;samples&quot; and &quot;loops&quot; as construction kits for sonic compositions. This led to a period of creative experimentation and the development of new forms, some of which became known as electronica. Wide ranges of influences, both sonic and compositional, are combined in electronica recordings.

Electronica includes a wide variety of musical acts and styles, linked by a penchant for overtly electronic production; a range which includes more popular acts such as Björk, Madonna, Goldfrapp and IDM artists such as Autechre, and Aphex Twin.

=== Regional differences ===
The North American mainstream music industry uses the term as an umbrella category to refer any dance-based electronic music styles with a potential for pop appeal. However, United States–based AllMusic still categorizes electronica as a top-level genre, stating that it includes danceable grooves, as well as music for headphones and chillout areas.

In other parts of the world, especially in the UK, electronica is also a broad term, but is associated with non-dance-oriented music, including relatively experimental styles of listening electronic music. It partly overlaps what is known chiefly outside the UK as intelligent dance music (IDM).

==Included in contemporary media==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, electronica was increasingly used as background scores for television advertisements, initially for automobiles. It was also used for various video games, including the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series, for which the soundtrack was composed of many popular electronica tracks that helped create more interest in this type of music—and later for other technological and business products such as computers and financial services. Then in 2011, Hyundai Veloster, in association with the Grammys, produced a project that became known as Re:Generation.

<doc id="87607" wikidata="Q734907" url="?curid=87607" title="Whitehouse (band)">
<text>Whitehouse were an English noise music band formed in 1980. The group is largely credited for the founding of the power electronics genre. Whitehouse was founded and ended as a duo consisting of electronics player Philip Best and vocalist William Bennett, however the group is perhaps best–recognized for their 20-year-tenure as a three-piece with synthist Peter Sotos as a member, who joined the band in 1983 and left in 2003. 

==History and personnel==
The name Whitehouse was chosen both in mock tribute to the British morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, and in reference to a British pornographic magazine of the same name.

The group&#x27;s founding member and sole constant was William Bennett. He began as a guitarist for Essential Logic. He wrote of those early years, &quot;I often fantasised about creating a sound that could bludgeon an audience into submission.&quot; Bennett later recorded as Come (featuring contributions from the likes of Daniel Miller and J. G. Thirlwell) before forming Whitehouse in 1980. Bennett&#x27;s first release as Whitehouse was &quot;Birthdeath Experience&quot;, released on his own Come Organisation label, which was immediately followed by the album &quot;Total Sex&quot;.

In 1981, Bennett released &quot;Erector&quot;, which was pressed on red vinyl and packaged in a shiny black sleeve with a photocopied picture of a penis. &quot;Erector&quot; deviated from the first two releases in experimenting with subsonic frequencies and contrasting low synth drones overlain with high-pitched screeches.

The group began performing live in 1982, with members Andrew McKenzie (The Hafler Trio) and Steven Stapleton (Nurse With Wound). In 2009, Bennett claimed that his pre-eminent inspiration was Yoko Ono: &quot;Yoko&#x27;s amazing music was by far the biggest influence on me, and Whitehouse, in the formative years (despite what some would have you believe).&quot;

Philip Best joined the group in 1982 at the age of 16, after running away from home. He was a member on and off ever since.

The group was inactive for the second half of the 1980s. A &quot;special biographical note&quot; on the Susan Lawly website states, &quot;All members of Whitehouse went to live outside London for varying reasons and pursued separate lives. There was a feeling in the group that all that could be achieved had been realised.&quot;

Eventually, Whitehouse re-emerged with a series of albums, recorded by the American audio engineer, Steve Albini, beginning with 1990&#x27;s &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;. Albini worked with the band until 1998, when Bennett took over all production duties.

Through the 1990s the most stable line-up was Bennett, Best, and the writer Peter Sotos. Sotos left in 2002, leaving the band as a two-piece.

The band had numerous other members in the 1980s including Kevin Tomkins, Steven Stapleton, Glenn Michael Wallis, John Murphy, Stefan Jaworzyn, Jim Goodall and Andrew McKenzie, though many of these participated only at live performances, not on recordings.

Bennett terminated Whitehouse in 2008 to concentrate on his newly founded Cut Hands project. He also has found success as an Italo disco DJ under the name &quot;DJ Benetti&quot;.

==Music==
Whitehouse specialized in self-described &quot;extreme electronic music&quot;. They were known for their controversial lyrics and imagery, which portrayed sadistic sex and rape through the point of view of notorious serial killers such as Peter Kurten and Dennis Andrew Nilsen. Later works explored the psychology of eating disorders and child abuse amongst other forms of violence and abjection.

Whitehouse emerged as earlier industrial acts such as Throbbing Gristle and SPK were pulling back from noise and extreme sounds and embracing relatively more conventional musical genres. In opposition to this trend, Whitehouse wanted to take these earlier groups&#x27; sounds and fascination with extreme subject matter even further; as referenced on the sleeve of their first LP, the group wished to &quot;cut pure human states&quot; and produce &quot;the most extreme music ever recorded&quot;. In doing so, they drew inspiration from some earlier experimental musicians and artists such as Alvin Lucier, Robert Ashley, and Yoko Ono as well as writers such as Marquis de Sade.

Whitehouse&#x27;s early records heavily involved the use of the EDP WASP synthesizer. The signature sonic elements included simple pulverizing electronic bass tones twinned with needling high frequencies, sometimes combined with ferocious washes of white noise, with or without vocals (usually aggressive frenzied screams alongside sinister whispers). In a 1990 interview, Bennett recalled: &quot;I remember seeing an issue of that punk fanzine &quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot; and it said that all you needed to make music was to learn three chords, and I thought why do you even need to know three chords to make music? Why do you even need to use a guitar? The idea of thunderous extreme noises appealed to me.&quot;

Beginning on the controversial 1999 release &quot;Mummy and Daddy&quot;, the band phased out the analog equipment responsible for their prior sound, instead relying more heavily on computers. From 2003 onward, they began incorporating percussive rhythms of African instruments such as the djembe, both sampled and performed in-studio.

==Reception and influence==
Whitehouse were a key influence in the development of noise music as a musical genre in Europe, Japan, the US, and elsewhere. The early music of Whitehouse is often credited with pioneering the power electronics genre (a term Bennett himself coined on the blurb to the &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; album) and noise genres.

Alternative Press included Whitehouse in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, opining that &quot;many will argue [Whitehouse] have beaten Throbbing Gristle at their own game.&quot;

The band&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Bird Seed&quot; was given an &#x27;honourable mention&#x27; in the digital musics category of Austria&#x27;s annual Prix Ars Electronica awards.

<doc id="87610" wikidata="Q272560" url="?curid=87610" title="USS Missouri (BB-63)">
<text>USS &quot;Missouri&quot; (BB-63) is an built for the United States Navy (USN) in the 1940s and is a museum ship. Completed in 1944, she is the last battleship commissioned by the United States. The ship was assigned to the Pacific Theater during World War II, where she participated in the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and shelled the Japanese home islands. Her quarterdeck was the site of the surrender of the Empire of Japan, which ended World War II.

After World War II, &quot;Missouri&quot; served in various diplomatic, show of force and training missions. On 17 January 1950 the ship ran aground during high tide in Chesapeake Bay and after great effort was re-floated several weeks later. She later fought in the Korean War during two tours between 1950 and 1953. &quot;Missouri&quot; was the first American battleship to arrive in Korean waters and served as the flagship for several admirals. The battleship took part in numerous shore bombardment operations and also served in a screening role for aircraft carriers. &quot;Missouri&quot; was decommissioned in 1955 and transferred to the reserve fleet (also known as the &quot;Mothball Fleet&quot;).

&quot;Missouri&quot; was reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan. Cruise missile and anti-ship missile launchers were added along with updated electronics. The ship served in the Persian Gulf escorting oil tankers during threats from Iran, often while keeping her fire-control systems trained on land-based Iranian missile launchers. She served in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 including providing fire support.

&quot;Missouri&quot; was again decommissioned in 1992, but remained on the Naval Vessel Register until her name was struck in 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

== Background and description ==

The &quot;Iowa&quot; class of fast battleships was designed in the late 1930s in response to the US Navy&#x27;s expectations for a future war with the Empire of Japan. The last battleships to be built by the United States, they were also the US Navy&#x27;s largest and fastest vessels of the type. American officers preferred comparatively slow but heavily armed and armored battleships, but Navy planners determined that such a fleet would have difficulty in bringing the faster Japanese fleet to battle, particularly the s and the aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet. Design studies prepared during the development of the earlier and es demonstrated the difficulty in resolving the desires of fleet officers with those of the planning staff within the displacement limits imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty system, which had governed capital ship construction since 1923. An escalator clause in the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 allowed an increase from to in the event that any member nation refused to sign the treaty, which Japan refused to do.

&quot;Missouri&quot; is long overall and is long at the waterline. The ship has a beam of and a draft of at her full combat load of . The &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships are powered by four General Electric geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were designed to give a top speed of , but were built to handle a 20 percent overload. None of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s ever ran speed trials in deep water, but the Bureau of Ships estimated that they could reach a speed of about from at a light displacement of . The ships had a designed cruising range of at a speed of , although the &#x27;s fuel consumption figures during her sea trials suggest that her range was at least at that cruising speed. Their designed crew numbered 117 officers and 1,804 enlisted men which had greatly increased by the end of the war in 1945. &quot;Missouri&quot;″s crew at that time numbered 189 officers and 2,978 sailors.

===Armament, fire control, sensors and aircraft===
The main battery of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships consisted of nine /50 caliber Mark 7 guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure, with the third aft. Going from bow to stern, the turrets were designated I, II, and III. Their secondary battery consisted of twenty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin-gun turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on each broadside. Unlike their sister ships and &quot;New Jersey&quot; that were the first pair of ships built, &quot;Missouri&quot; and were completed with an anti-aircraft suite of twenty quadruple mounts for Bofors AA guns, nine mounts on each broadside and one each on the roofs of Turrets II and III. Forty-nine Oerlikon light AA auto-cannon in single mounts were distributed almost the length of the ships.

The primary means of controlling the main armament are two Mark 38 directors for the Mark 38 fire-control system mounted at the tops of the fore and aft fire-control towers in the superstructure. These directors were equipped with rangefinders, although their primary sensor was the Mark 8 fire-control radar mounted on their roofs. A secondary Mark 40 fire-control director was installed inside the armored conning tower at the front of the superstructure that used the Mark 27 fire-control radar positioned on the top of the conning tower. Each turret is fitted with a rangefinder long and can act as a director for the other turrets. Four Mark 37 gunnery directors, two on the centerline at the ends of the superstructure and one on each broadside, control the five-inch guns. Each director was equipped with a rangefinder and a pair of radars on its roof. These were a Mark 12 fire-control system and a Mark 22 height-finder radar. Each 40 mm mount was remotely controlled by a Mark 51 director that incorporated a Mark 14 lead-computing gyro gunsight while the sailors that used the 20 mm gun used a Mark 14 sight to track their targets.

A SK-2 early-warning radar was fitted on the ship&#x27;s foremast; above it was a SG surface-search radar. The other SG radar was mounted at the top of the mainmast positioned on the rear funnel.

The &quot;Iowa&quot;s were built with two rotating aircraft catapults on their stern for floatplanes and a large crane was fitted to recover them. Initially a trio of Vought OS2U Kingfishers were carried, but these were replaced by Curtiss SC Seahawks in December 1944.

===Protection===
The internal waterline armor belt of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships is thick and has a height of . Below it is a strake of Class B homogeneous armor plate that tapers in thickness from 12.1 inches at the top to at the bottom and is high. The two strakes of armor are inclined outwards at the top 19 degrees to improve the armor&#x27;s resistance to horizontal fire. In general the vertical armor plates are made from Class A cemented armor and the horizontal armor from Class B or special treatment steel (STS). The belt armor extends to the two transverse bulkheads fore and aft of the main-gun barbettes, forming the armored citadel. Part of the lower armor belt extends aft from the rear bulkhead to protect the ships&#x27; steering gear. Its maximum thickness ranges from at the top and the plates taper to 5 inches at the bottom. Unlike the &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the armor plates in the forward transverse bulkhead in &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; have a maximum thickness of at the top that tapers to . The aft bulkhead is a consistent 14.5 inches in thickness, but does not go below the lower belt extension due it meeting the armored third deck protecting the shafts and steering gears; the steering gear is closed by another 14.5-inch aft bulkhead.

The main-gun turrets has Class B plates thick on their faces and of Class A plates on their sides. The armor plates protecting their barbettes range in thickness from to and with the thickest plates on the sides and the thinnest ones on the front and back. The sides of the conning tower are thick. The main deck of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s consists of of STS. Below this deck, the roof of the armored citadel is formed by of armor in two layers. Below this is a deck of STS plates intended to stop splinters from shells that pierced the armored deck above it. The armor deck extends aft and the roof of the steering gear compartment is thick.

The underwater protection system of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships consists of three watertight compartments outboard of the lower armor belt and another behind it. The two outermost compartment are kept loaded with fuel oil or seawater to absorb the energy of the torpedo warhead&#x27;s detonation and slow the resulting splinters so they can be stopped by the lower armor belt. Behind the belt is a holding bulkhead intended to protect the ships&#x27; inner spaces from any splinters that might penetrate and the subsequent flooding. For protection against naval mines, the &quot;Iowa&quot;s have a double bottom that runs the full length of the ships and increases to a triple bottom except at the bow and stern.

==History==
===Construction===
&quot;Missouri&quot; was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after the US state of Missouri. The ship was authorized by Congress in 1938 and ordered on 12 June 1940 with the hull number BB-63. The keel for &quot;Missouri&quot; was laid down at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 6 January 1941 in slipway 1. The ship was launched on 29 January 1944 before a crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 spectators. At the launching ceremony, the ship was christened by Margaret Truman, the ship sponsor and daughter of Harry S. Truman, then one of the senators from the ship&#x27;s namesake state; Truman himself gave a speech at the ceremony. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and the ship was commissioned on 11 June; Captain William Callaghan served as her first commander.

&quot;Missouri&quot; conducted her initial sea trials off New York, beginning on 10 July, and then steamed south to Chesapeake Bay, where she embarked on a shakedown cruise and conducted training. During this period, she operated with the new large cruiser , which had also recently entered service, and several escorting destroyers. The ship got underway on 11 November, bound for the West Coast of the United States. She passed through the Panama Canal a week later and continued on to San Francisco. There, additional fitting-out work was carried out at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard to prepare the vessel for use as a fleet flagship.

=== World War II (1944–1945) ===
On 14 December, &quot;Missouri&quot; departed San Francisco and sailed for Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, where she joined the rest of the fleet on 13 January 1945. She became a temporary headquarters ship for Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher. She then joined Task Force 58, which sortied on 27 January to launch an air attack on Tokyo in support of the planned operation against Iwo Jima. &quot;Missouri&quot; served as part of the anti-aircraft screen for Task Group 58.2, centered on the carriers , , and , during the raid on Tokyo. In addition to guarding the carriers, &quot;Missouri&quot; and the other battleships acted as oilers for the escorting destroyers, since the fleet&#x27;s logistics train could not accompany the strike force during raids.

By 16 February, the task force had arrived off the coast of Japan to begin a series of airstrikes. The fleet then proceeded to Iwo Jima, which was invaded by American ground forces on 19 February. That evening, while patrolling with the carriers, &quot;Missouri&quot; shot down a Japanese aircraft, probably a Nakajima Ki-49 bomber. Task Force 58 departed in early March and returned to Ulithi to replenish fuel and ammunition. &quot;Missouri&quot; was transferred to the task group, TG 58.4 at that time.

The ships departed again on 14 March for another round of air strikes on Japan. Four days later, &quot;Missouri&quot;″s anti-aircraft guns assisted in the destruction of four Japanese aircraft. American carrier aircraft struck a variety of targets around the Inland Sea, which prompted a Japanese counter-attack that struck several carriers. The carrier was badly damaged and &quot;Missouri&quot;″s task group was detached to cover her withdrawal. By 22 March, &quot;Franklin&quot; had left the area of operations and the group returned to the fleet to join the preparatory bombardment for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa. &quot;Missouri&quot; was temporarily transferred to TF 59, along with her sisters &quot;New Jersey&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, to bombard the southern coast of Okinawa on 24 March, part of an effort to draw Japanese attention from the actual invasion target on the western side of the island, during which she fired 180 rounds. &quot;Missouri&quot; thereafter returned to TG 58.4.
While operating with the carriers on 11 April, &quot;Missouri&quot; came under attack from a kamikaze that struck the side of the vessel below the main deck. The impact shattered the aircraft, throwing gasoline on the deck that rapidly ignited, but it was quickly suppressed by her crew. The attack caused superficial damage and the battleship remained on station. Two crewmen were wounded on 17 April when another kamikaze clipped the stern crane and crashed in the ship&#x27;s wake. &quot;Missouri&quot; left Task Force 58 on 5 May to return to Ulithi; in the course of her operations off Okinawa, she claimed five aircraft shot down and another probable kill, along with partial credit for another six aircraft destroyed. While en route, &quot;Missouri&quot; refueled from a fleet oiler that also brought the ship&#x27;s new commander, Captain Stuart S. Murray, who relieved Captain Callaghan on 14 May.

On 9 May, &quot;Missouri&quot; reached Ulithi, before continuing on to Apra Harbor, Guam, where she arrived nine days later. Admiral William F. Halsey Jr., the commander of Third Fleet, came aboard the ship that day, making her the fleet flagship of what was now re-designated as TF 38. On 21 May, the battleship got underway again, bound for Okinawa. She had reached the operational area by 27 May, when she took part in attacks on Japanese positions on the island. Together with the rest of the Third Fleet, she then steamed north to conduct a series of air strikes on Japanese airfields and other installations on the island of Kyūshū on 2 and 3 June. The fleet was struck by a major typhoon on the night of 5–6 June, which caused extensive damage to many ships of the fleet, though &quot;Missouri&quot; suffered only minor damage. Another round of air strikes against targets on Kyūshū took place on 8 June. The fleet then withdrew to Leyte Gulf to replenish fuel and ammunition, arriving there on 13 June.

Third Fleet got underway again on 1 July to launch another series of attacks on the Japanese Home Islands. During this period, &quot;Missouri&quot; operated with TG 38.4. The carrier aircraft struck targets around Tokyo on 10 July, and then further north between Honshū and Hokkaidō from 13 to 14 July. The following day, &quot;Missouri&quot; and several other vessels were detached to form TG 38.4.2 which was tasked with bombarding industrial facilities in Muroran, Hokkaido. A second bombardment mission followed on the night of 17–18 July, by which time the British battleship had joined the formation. The battleships then returned to screen the carriers during strikes against targets around the Inland Sea and then Tokyo later in the month. After a brief pause, the carriers resumed attacks on northern Japan on 9 August, the same day as the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. The following day, rumors circulated that Japan would surrender, which was formally announced on the morning of 15 August.

==== Signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender ====

Over the course of the following two weeks, Allied forces made preparations to begin the occupation of Japan. On 21 August, &quot;Missouri&quot; sent a contingent of 200 officers and men to &quot;Iowa&quot;, which was to debark a landing party in Tokyo to begin the process of demilitarizing Japan. Two days later, Murray was informed that &quot;Missouri&quot; would host the surrender ceremony, with the date scheduled for 31 August. The ship&#x27;s crew immediately began preparations for the event, including cleaning and painting the vessel. &quot;Missouri&quot; began the approach to Tokyo Bay on 27 August, guided by the . That night, the ships stopped at Kamakura, where a courier brought the flag that Commodore Matthew Perry had flown during his expedition to open Japan in 1853; the flag was to be displayed during the surrender ceremony. The flotilla then entered Tokyo Bay on 29 August, and &quot;Missouri&quot; was anchored close to where Perry had anchored his own vessels some ninety-two years earlier. Poor weather delayed the ceremony until 2 September.

Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz boarded shortly after 08:00, and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allies, came on board at 08:43. The Japanese representatives, headed by Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, arrived at 08:56, 2 September 1945. At 09:02, General MacArthur stepped before a battery of microphones and opened the 23-minute surrender ceremony to the waiting world by stating, &quot;It is my earnest hope—indeed the hope of all mankind—that from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past, a world founded upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for freedom, tolerance, and justice.&quot;

By 09:30 the Japanese emissaries had departed. In the afternoon of 5 September, Halsey transferred his flag to the battleship , and early the next day &quot;Missouri&quot; departed Tokyo Bay. As part of the ongoing Operation Magic Carpet she received homeward-bound passengers at Guam, then sailed unescorted for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 September and flew Admiral Nimitz&#x27;s flag on the afternoon of 28 September for a reception.

=== Post-war (1946–1950) ===

The next day, &quot;Missouri&quot; departed Pearl Harbor bound for the East Coast of the United States. She reached New York City on 23 October and hoisted the flag of Atlantic Fleet commander Admiral Jonas Ingram. Four days later, the battleship fired a 21-gun salute (the first of 3 that day) as Truman—who had since become President of the United States—boarded for Navy Day ceremonies.
After an overhaul in the New York Naval Shipyard that included the replacement of the Mark 8 fire-control radars with Mark 13 models, and a training cruise to Cuba, &quot;Missouri&quot; returned to New York. During the afternoon of 21 March 1946, she received the remains of the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Munir Ertegun. She departed on 22 March for Gibraltar, and on 5 April anchored in the Bosphorus off Istanbul. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19-gun salutes during the transfer of the remains of the late ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.

&quot;Missouri&quot; departed Istanbul on 9 April and entered Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece, the following day for a welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become the scene of a civil war between the pro-communist-dominated left-wing resistance organization EAM-ELAS and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pushing for concessions in the Dodecanese to be included in the peace treaty with Italy and for access through the Dardanelles strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The voyage of &quot;Missouri&quot; to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America&#x27;s strategic commitment to the region. News media proclaimed her a symbol of US interest in preserving Greece and Turkey&#x27;s independence.
&quot;Missouri&quot; departed Piraeus on 26 April, touching at Algiers and Tangiers before arriving at Norfolk on 9 May. She departed for Culebra Island on 12 May to join Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s 8th Fleet in the Navy&#x27;s first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City on 27 May, and spent the next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the Davis Strait and south to the Caribbean on various training exercises. On 3 December, during a gunnery exercise in the North Atlantic, a star shell fired by the light cruiser accidentally struck the battleship, killing one crewman and wounding three others.

&quot;Missouri&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 30 August 1947 for the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Hemisphere Peace and Security. President Truman boarded on 2 September to celebrate the signing of the Rio Treaty, which broadened the Monroe Doctrine by stipulating that an attack on any one of the signatory American countries would be considered an attack on all.

The Truman family boarded &quot;Missouri&quot; on 7 September 1947 to return to the United States and disembarked at Norfolk on 19 September. Her overhaul in New York, which lasted from 23 September to 10 March 1948 included upgrading most of her radar suite. The SK-2 system was replaced by a SR-3 radar and both SG fire-control radars were removed, an improved SG-6 replaced the forward antenna and the aft SG was exchanged for a SP height-finding radar; Mark 25 fire-control radars replaced the combination Mark 12/22 installations on the roofs of the Mark 37 directors. After the overhaul, the ship worked up at Guantanamo Bay. The summer of 1948 was devoted to midshipman and reserve training cruises. Also in 1948, &quot;Missouri&quot; became the first battleship to host a helicopter detachment, operating two Sikorsky HO3S-1 machines for utility and rescue work. The battleship departed Norfolk on 1 November 1948 for a second three-week Arctic cold-weather training cruise to the Davis Strait. During the next two years, &quot;Missouri&quot; participated in exercises from the New England coast to the Caribbean, alternated with two midshipman summer training cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 23 September 1949 to 17 January 1950.

Throughout the latter half of the 1940s, the various service branches of the United States had been reducing their inventories from their World War II levels. For the Navy, this resulted in several vessels of various types being decommissioned and either sold for scrap or placed in one of the various United States Navy reserve fleets scattered along the coasts. As part of this contraction, three of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships had been de-activated and decommissioned but President Truman refused to allow &quot;Missouri&quot; to be decommissioned. Against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered &quot;Missouri&quot; to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter Margaret.
Captain William D. Brown assumed command of the battleship on 10 December while she was being overhauled. Then the only US battleship in commission, &quot;Missouri&quot; was proceeding from Hampton Roads on her first training exercise at sea since the overhaul, early on 17 January 1950 when she ran aground from Thimble Shoal Light, near Old Point Comfort. She hit shoal water a distance of three ship-lengths from the main channel. The error resulted from a combination of many factors, including Brown&#x27;s inexperience maneuvering such a large ship. The grounding occurred during a particularly high tide making the effort to free her even more difficult as did having an abandoned anchor becoming embedded in her hull. After off-loading ammunition, fuel and food to lighten the battleship, she was refloated on 1 February with the aid of tugboats, pontoons, beach gear and a rising tide.

After the subsequent Naval Board of Inquiry, Brown and three of his officers were court-martialled. Brown was relieved of command and his subordinates were reprimanded. Captain Harold Page Smith assumed command on 7 February as the &quot;Missouri&quot;″s repairs were being completed. Having repaired morale aboard during his tenure as the ship was relegated to training duties in an effort to cut costs by Johnson, Page Smith was replaced by Captain Irving Duke on 19 April.

=== Korean War (1950–1953) ===
In 1950, the Korean War started, prompting the United States to intervene on behalf of the United Nations (UN). President Truman ordered US forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent US-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization &quot;Missouri&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula. Due to the urgency of her mission Duke took the battleship directly through a hurricane off the coast of North Carolina on 20 August that blew her helicopters off the stern and damaged her enough that she required nearly a week&#x27;s worth of repairs once she reached Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Missouri&quot; arrived just west of Kyūshū on 14 September, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Allan Edward Smith. The first American battleship to reach Korean waters, she bombarded Samchok on 15 September in an attempt to divert troops and attention from the Incheon landings. After a brief visit to Sasebo, Japan, to resupply, the ship arrived at Incheon on 19 September, and began bombarding North Korean troops as they retreated north. On 10 October she became flagship of Rear Admiral John M. Higgins, commander of Cruiser Division 5. She arrived at Sasebo on 14 October, where she became flagship of Vice Admiral A. D. Struble, Commander, Seventh Fleet. After screening the carrier along the east coast of Korea, she conducted bombardment missions from 12 to 26 October in the Chongjin and Tanchon areas on the west coast, and at Wonsan where she again screened carriers eastward of Wonsan. During this time, comedian Bob Hope visited the battleship and gave three performances for the crew.

MacArthur&#x27;s amphibious landings at Incheon had severed the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) supply lines; as a result, the KPA had begun a lengthy retreat from South Korea into North Korea. This retreat was closely monitored by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), out of fear that the UN offensive against Korea would create a US-backed enemy on China&#x27;s border, and out of concern that the UN offensive in Korea could evolve into a UN war against China. In an effort to dissuade UN forces from completely overrunning North Korea, the People&#x27;s Republic of China issued diplomatic warnings that they would use force to protect North Korea, but these warnings were not taken seriously for a number of reasons. This changed abruptly on 19 October 1950, when the first of an eventual total of soldiers under the command of General Peng Dehuai crossed into North Korea, launching a full-scale assault against advancing UN troops. The PRC offensive forced UN troops to retreat. The &quot;Missouri&quot; provided gunfire support during the Hungnam evacuation in December until the last UN troops, the American 3rd Infantry Division, departed on 24 December.

In early 1951 &quot;Missouri&quot; alternated carrier escort duty and shore bombardments off the east coast of Korea until 19 March. During a visit to Yokosuka, Japan, Captain George Wright relieved Duke as commanding officer on 2 March. The battleship arrived at Yokosuka on 24 March and departed the port four days later for the United States, having fired 2,895 sixteen-inch rounds and 8,043 five-inch shells during her deployment. Upon her arrival at Norfolk on 27 April the ship became the flagship of Rear Admiral James L. Holloway, Jr., commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. From May to August, she engaged in two midshipman training cruises. &quot;Missouri&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard 18 October for an overhaul which lasted until 30 January 1952. Captain John Sylvester assumed command of the ship the same day her overhaul began.

&quot;Missouri&quot; spent the next six months training out of Guantanamo Bay and Norfolk and made a port visit to New York in May where she participated in Navy Day celebrations, hosting nearly 11,000 visitors. She returned to Norfolk on 4 August and entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard to prepare for a second tour in the Korean combat zone. Captain Warner Edsall relieved Sylvester at the beginning of the overhaul. The battleship departed Hampton Roads on 11 September and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October.

Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, commander of the Seventh Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide naval gunfire support, codenamed &quot;Cobra strikes&quot;, in the Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam from 25 October through 2 January 1953. One of the ship&#x27;s helicopters crashed on 21 December while trying to assess the damage from a bombardment; all three men aboard were killed. &quot;Missouri&quot; put into Incheon on 5 January and then sailed to Sasebo. General Mark W. Clark, Commander in Chief, UN Command, and Admiral Sir Guy Russell, the British Commander-in-Chief, Far East Fleet, visited the battleship on 23 January. In the following weeks, &quot;Missouri&quot; resumed &quot;Cobra&quot; missions along the east coast of Korea. As part of these, the ship would enter Wonsan Harbor to bombard targets there. North Korea artillery fruitlessly engaged her there on two occasions, 5 and 10 March, as their shells were fused to burst in the air. In retaliation for the latter incident, &quot;Missouri&quot;″s five-inch guns fired 998 shells at the North Korean positions. The last bombardment mission by &quot;Missouri&quot; was against the Kojo area on 25 March; she had fired 2,895 sixteen-inch and 8,043 five-inch shells during the deployment. The following day, Edsall suffered a fatal heart attack while conning her through the anti-submarine nets defending Sasebo Harbor. Captain Robert Brodie assumed command on 4 April. &quot;Missouri&quot; was relieved as the Seventh Fleet flagship on 6 April by &quot;New Jersey&quot; and departed Yokosuka on 7 April.
&quot;Missouri&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 4 May; Rear Admiral E. T. Woolridge, commander, Battleships-Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, hoisted his flag aboard her 10 days later. She departed on 8 June on a midshipman training cruise to Brazil, Cuba and Panama and returned to Norfolk on 4 August. Woolridge hauled down his flag in October as he transferred to another ship; Rear Admiral Clark Green, commander of Battleship Division 2 replaced him. The battleship was overhauled in Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 20 November to 2 April 1954 that included replacing her 16-inch guns and exchanging her SP radar for a SPS-8 system that required strengthening the mainmast to handle its weight. The day before the end of the overhaul, Captain Taylor Keith relieved Brodie in command of the ship. As the flagship of Rear Admiral Ruthven Libby, who had relieved Woolridge, &quot;Missouri&quot; departed Norfolk on 7 June as the flagship of the midshipman training cruise to Lisbon, Portugal, Cherbourg, France, and Cuba. During this voyage &quot;Missouri&quot; was joined by the other three battleships of her class, the only time the four ships sailed together. She returned to Norfolk on 3 August and departed on 23 August to be placed in reserve on the West Coast. The ship hosted 16,900 people at Long Beach, but more than 20,100 visited in San Francisco. &quot;Missouri&quot; arrived in Seattle on 15 September where she again hosted visitors and subsequently off-loaded her ammunition at the facility in Bangor. The ship was decommissioned on 26 February 1955 at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard where she was assigned to the Bremerton group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. &quot;Missouri&quot; retained her Mark 27 radar until the mid-1950s.

====Deactivation====
&quot;Missouri&quot; was moored at the last pier of the reserve fleet berthing. She served as a tourist attraction, logging about 250,000 visitors per year, who came to view the &quot;surrender deck&quot; where a bronze plaque memorialized the spot () in Tokyo Bay where Japan surrendered to the Allies. The accompanying historical display included copies of the surrender documents Nearly thirty years passed before &quot;Missouri&quot; returned to active duty.

===Reactivation (1984–1990)===
Under the Reagan Administration&#x27;s program to build a 600-ship Navy, led by Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, &quot;Missouri&quot; was reactivated and towed by the salvage ship to the Long Beach Naval Yard in the summer of 1984 to undergo modernization in advance of her scheduled recommissioning. In preparation for the move, a skeleton crew of 20 spent three weeks working 12 to 16-hour days preparing the battleship for her tow.

Over the next several months, the ship had her obsolete armament removed: 20 mm and 40 mm AA guns, their directors, and four of her ten 5-inch gun mounts. Installed in their place on the superstructure were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rotary cannon for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. She also received upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Additions included an AN/SPS-49 early-warning radar and an AN/SPS-67 surface-search radar while the SPS-8 radar and the mainmast were removed. The added missile capacity necessitated additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the ship was equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system. &quot;Missouri&quot; was also outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie to be used as a decoy against enemy torpedoes, an AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite electronic-warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent&#x27;s radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles. The ship&#x27;s crew now consisted of 65 officers and 1,450 enlisted men.

During the modernization the ship&#x27;s bell, which had been removed from the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. &quot;Missouri&quot; was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986 with Captain Albert Kaiss in command. &quot;This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power&quot;, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to &quot;listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions.&quot; Margaret Truman gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship&#x27;s crew, which ended with &quot;now take care of my baby.&quot; Her remarks were met with rounds of applause from the crew.

Only briefly in command, Kaiss was relieved by Captain James A. Carney on 20 June. Three months later &quot;Missouri&quot; departed from her new home port of Long Beach for an around-the-world cruise, visiting Pearl Harbor Hawaii; Sydney, Hobart, and Perth, Australia; Diego Garcia; the Suez Canal; Istanbul, Turkey; Naples, Italy; Rota, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; and the Panama Canal. &quot;Missouri&quot; became the first American battleship to circumnavigate the globe since Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; 80 years before—a fleet which included the first battleship named .

In 1987, &quot;Missouri&quot; was outfitted with 40 mm grenade launchers and 25 mm chain guns and sent to take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, &quot;Missouri&quot; escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire-control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.

The ship returned to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Captain John Chernesky relieved Carney on 6 July in Pearl Harbor during the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RimPac) exercises that had begun a few weeks earlier. Other highlights during the year included port visits in British Columbia and Washington.

In the early months of 1989, &quot;Missouri&quot; was in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for routine maintenance. It was there that the Missouri was the site and setting of Cher&#x27;s music video for &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;. A few months later she departed for the multi-national Pacific Exercise (PacEx) &#x27;89, where she and &quot;New Jersey&quot; performed a firepower demonstration off Okinawa for the Japanese and some of the other allied ships. Missouri fired 45 rounds of 16-inch and 263 of 5-inch, considerably more than her sister. The highlight of PacEx was a port visit in Pusan, Republic of Korea during which she had some trouble docking in the port&#x27;s shallow water. At the end of the year, the ship visited Mazatlan, Mexico. In early 1990, &quot;Missouri&quot; again took part in the RimPac Exercise and Kaiss returned to relieve Chernesky on 13 June.

=== Gulf War (January–February 1991) ===

On 2 August 1990 Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait. In the middle of the month US President George H. W. Bush sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a standoff with Iraq.

&quot;Missouri&quot;″s scheduled four-month Western Pacific port-to-port cruise set to begin in September was canceled just a few days before the ship was to leave; after the cruise was completed, the ship was due to begin the process of inactivation. She had been placed on hold in anticipation of being mobilized as forces continued to mass in the Middle East. As part of the preparations for combat, a detachment of AAI RQ-2 Pioneer unmanned aerial vehicles were transferred to the ship to improve her ability to direct her gunfire. &quot;Missouri&quot; departed on 13 November 1990 for the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf. She departed Long Beach, with extensive press coverage, and headed for Hawaii and the Philippines for more work-ups en route to the Persian Gulf. Along the way she made stops at Subic Bay and Pattaya, Thailand, before transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 3 January 1991. Before Operation Desert Storm began later that month, &quot;Missouri&quot; prepared to launch Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and provide naval gunfire support as required. The ship fired her first Tomahawk missile at Iraqi targets at 01:40 am on 17 January 1991, followed by 27 additional missiles over the next five days.

On 29 January, the frigate escorted &quot;Missouri&quot; northward. In her first bombardment action of Desert Storm, she shelled an Iraqi command and control bunker near the Saudi border, the first time her 16-inch guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea. The battleship bombarded beach defenses in occupied Kuwait on the night of 3 February, firing 112 main-gun rounds over the next three days until relieved by &quot;Wisconsin&quot;. &quot;Missouri&quot; then fired another 60 rounds off Khafji on 11–12 February before steaming north to Faylaka Island. After minesweepers cleared a lane through Iraqi defenses, the ship fired 133 rounds during four shore bombardment missions as part of the amphibious landing feint against the Kuwaiti coast the morning of 23 and 24 February. The heavy pounding attracted Iraqi attention; in response to the battleship&#x27;s artillery strike, the Iraqis fired two HY-2 Silkworm missiles at the battleship, one of which crashed shortly after launching. The other missile was intercepted by a GWS-30 Sea Dart missile launched from the British destroyer within 90 seconds and crashed into the sea roughly in front of &quot;Missouri&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the battleship&#x27;s Pioneer drones located the missile launchers and neutralized them with about fifty 16-inch shells.

During the campaign, &quot;Missouri&quot; was involved in a friendly fire incident with the frigate . According to the official report, on 25 February, &quot;Jarrett&quot;″s Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by &quot;Missouri&quot; as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck the battleship, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. One sailor aboard &quot;Missouri&quot; was struck in the neck by flying debris and suffered minor injuries.

During the operation, &quot;Missouri&quot; also assisted coalition forces engaged in clearing Iraqi naval mines in the Persian Gulf. By the time the war ended, the ship&#x27;s crew had destroyed at least 15 naval mines.

With combat operations out of range of the battleship&#x27;s weapons on 26 February, &quot;Missouri&quot; had fired a total of 783 sixteen-inch shells and launched 28 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the campaign, and began patrolling the northern Persian Gulf until sailing for home on 21 March. Following stops at Fremantle and Hobart, Australia, the warship visited Pearl Harbor before arriving home in April. She spent the remainder of the year, hosting visitors in between training missions, the latter including a 7 December &quot;voyage of remembrance&quot; to mark the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. During that ceremony, &quot;Missouri&quot; hosted President Bush, the first such presidential visit for the warship since Harry S. Truman&#x27;s in September 1947.

=== Museum ship (1998 to present) ===

The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States led to drastic cuts in the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy&#x27;s active fleet became uneconomical. As a result &quot;Missouri&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1992 at Long Beach. Her last commanding officer, Captain Albert L. Kaiss, wrote in the ship&#x27;s final Plan of the Day:

&quot;Missouri&quot; returned to be part of the United States Navy reserve fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She remained in Bremerton, but was not open to tourists as she had been from 1957 to 1984. In spite of attempts by citizens&#x27; groups to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the US Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing (for the United States) its beginning. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton signed the donation contract that transferred her to the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. She was towed by &quot;Sea Victory&quot; from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, where she sat in fresh water at the mouth of the Columbia River to kill and drop the saltwater barnacles and sea grasses that had grown on her hull in Bremerton, then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, from the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, &quot;Missouri&quot; was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.

Originally, the decision to move &quot;Missouri&quot; to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The National Park Service expressed concern that the battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression &quot;Missouri&quot; was placed well back from and facing the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on &quot;Missouri&quot;″s aft decks would not have sight of the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. The decision to have &quot;Missouri&quot;″s bow face the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial was intended to convey that &quot;Missouri&quot; watches over the remains of &quot;Arizona&quot; so that those interred within &quot;Arizona&quot;″s hull may rest in peace.

&quot;Missouri&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 14 May 1971 for hosting the signing of the instrument of Japanese surrender that ended World War II. She is not eligible for designation as a National Historic Landmark because she was extensively modernized in the years following the surrender.

On 14 October 2009, &quot;Missouri&quot; was moved from her berthing station on Battleship Row to a drydock at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard to undergo a three-month overhaul. The work, priced at $18 million, included installing a new anti-corrosion system, repainting the hull, and upgrading the internal mechanisms. Drydock workers reported that the ship was leaking at some points on the starboard side. The repairs were completed the first week of January 2010 and the ship was returned to her berthing station on Battleship Row on 7 January 2010. The ship&#x27;s grand reopening occurred on 30 January. In 2018, a $3.5 million project was completed to restore and preserve the superstructure. This included the lower navigation bridge on level four which includes the chart house, the captain&#x27;s at-sea cabin, pilot house and conning tower and the open bridge on level five.

== Awards ==
&quot;Missouri&quot; earned three battle stars for World War II service, five for Korean War service and further three for Gulf War service. She has also earned the following awards:


==Appearances in popular culture==
Cher asked to film her 1989 music video of her song &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; aboard a US Navy ship and the Navy&#x27;s Office of Information in Washington approved. The Navy intended to have it filmed aboard &quot;New Jersey&quot; because &quot;Missouri&quot; would be at sea at the planned time. &quot;Missouri&quot;″s information officer told the producer: &quot;We&#x27;re the most historic battleship in the world. This is where World War II ended. You want to do it on here.&quot; Cher changed her schedule so that it could be filmed aboard &quot;Missouri&quot;. The performance was filmed over the 4th of July weekend. &quot;The production people did a spectacular job of rigging the ship with lights; The battleship became a dramatic stage for the...video.&quot; Her performance was racier than expected with her wearing a very revealing costume and straddling one of the 16-inch guns during a part of the performance. The video was mostly well received, especially by the crew, but the Navy received some complaints. Columnist Jack Anderson wrote &quot;If battleships could blush, the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; would be bright red&quot;. Afterwards, &quot;Missouri&quot;″s captain directed that the song be played when the ship was conducting underway replenishments with other ships.

The ship was central to the plot of the 1992 film &quot;Under Siege&quot; (many of the on-ship scenes were shot aboard the similar but older battleship ). The ship was also prominently featured in the 2012 sci-fi action film &quot;Battleship&quot;. As &quot;Missouri&quot; has not moved under her own power since 1992, shots of the ship at sea were obtained with the help of three tugboats.

<text>Tresor (German for safe or vault) is a techno nightclub in Berlin and a record label.

==History==

The club was founded in March 1991 in the vaults of the former department store Wertheim at Leipziger Strasse 126-128 in Mitte, the central part of East Berlin, next to the Potsdamer Platz. The history of the club goes back to 1988 when the electronic music label Interfisch opened the &quot;Ufo Club&quot; in Berlin. Ufo was the original centre of Berlin house and techno, but due to financial problems that club closed in 1990.

After Ufo closed, Interfisch&#x27;s head, Dimitri Hegemann, and some investors in the club found the new space in East Berlin. This was advantageous timing, as it was only a few months before Germany unified. The vaults under the Wertheim department store proved to be the perfect location for a club, and Tresor quickly became the place to be in Berlin. Tresor continued to be a popular club, having expanded and reconstructed continuously several times to include an outdoor garden area, and a second &quot;Globus&quot; floor. The Tresor floor in the basement was reserved specifically for hard techno, industrial and acid music, while Globus was featured mainly more mellow house sound. The record label Tresor Records was founded soon after the club first opened, in October 1991. Featured artists on the label include Jeff Mills, Blake Baxter, Juan Atkins, Robert Hood, Drexciya, Stewart Walker, Joey Beltram, DJ Surgeon, Pacou, Cristian Vogel and many others.

In 2004 the documentary &quot;Tresor Berlin: The Vault &amp; the Electronic Frontier&quot; was released. Directed by Mike Andrawis, it features interviews with Hegemann, Carola Stoiber, and DJs &amp; artists associated with the club &amp; label. The film covers the period from Hegemann&#x27;s involvement with the Fishladen and UFO clubs in Berlin-Kreuzberg to the final months prior to Tresor&#x27;s closure.

Tresor closed on 16 April 2005, after several years&#x27; prolonged short-term rent. The city sold the land to an investor group to build offices on the Leipziger Straße location. It was open for each night of April 2005, with the final event starting the Saturday night with queues stretching all the way down the road, and still going Monday morning.

Tresor reopened on 24 May 2007 in the decommissioned southern tract of the combined heat and power plant &quot;Heizkraftwerk Berlin-Mitte&quot; in Köpenicker Straße.

Since November 2019 the club has a subsidiary in the city of Dortmund called &quot;Tresor.West&quot;. 

In September 2022, Tresor published a photobook, &quot;Tresor: True Stories,&quot; to document the past 30 years of its history.

The development of the territory which now constitutes the oblast began in the early 17th century. Tomsk itself was founded in 1604. Some of the oblast&#x27;s territory is inaccessible because it is covered with taiga woods and swamps. Tomsk oblast contains Vasyugan Swamp, the biggest swamp in the northern hemisphere. The oblast borders with Krasnoyarsk Krai and Tyumen, Omsk, Novosibirsk, and Kemerovo Oblasts.

== Administrative divisions ==

The oblast is directly divided into four cities and sixteen districts. The four administrative cities are the administrative center of Tomsk, Kedrovy, Strezhevoy, and the closed city of Seversk.

== Geography ==
Tomsk Oblast, part of the wider region of Siberia, is almost entirely taiga. Approximately 85% of the oblast is forested, with Siberian pines, Scots pines, spruce, fir, and larch trees being some of the common trees in the area. Major rivers which pass through the oblast include the Ob, Tom, Chulym, Chaya, Ket, Parabel, Vasyugan, and the Tym.

==History==

Long before Siberia became part of Russia, the territory of modern Tomsk Oblast was inhabited by people belonging to the taiga Kulayskoy civilization known for its bronze artifacts.

The development of the region began at the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries. The oldest settlement in the area is the village (former city) Narym, founded in 1596.

The administrative center of the province, the city of Tomsk, was founded in 1604 by a decree of Tsar Boris Godunov. From 1719 to 1804 in the province of Tobolsk. In 1782, is formed by Tomskaya oblast in the composition of Tobolsky namestnichestva (from 1796 - Tobolskaya guberniya). In 1804 the Tomsk Governorate was founded, which existed until 1925, when it became part of the Siberian region (since 1930 - the West Siberian region). Tomsk Oblast was re-established on August 13, 1944. The city grew throughout the mid-20th century due to the migration of many Soviet institutions to Tomsk during World War II, the development of nuclear facilities in the region during the 1950s, as well as the beginning of petroleum production in the oblast during the 1960s and 1970s.

On July 26, 1995 the Oblast&#x27;s charter was adopted.

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Tomsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power.

<text>Novosibirsk Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) located in southwestern Siberia. Its administrative and economic center is the city of Novosibirsk. As of the 2021 Census, Novosibirsk Oblast had a population of 2,797,176.

==Geography==

===Overview===
Novosibirsk Oblast is located in the south of the West Siberian Plain, at the foothills of low Salair ridge, between the Ob and Irtysh Rivers. The oblast borders Omsk Oblast in the west, Kazakhstan (Pavlodar Province) in the southwest, Tomsk Oblast in the north, Kemerovo Oblast in the east, and Altai Krai in the south. The territory of the oblast extends for more than from west to east, and for over from north to south. The oblast is mainly plain; in the south the steppes prevail; in the north enormous tracts of woodland with great number of marshes prevail. There are many lakes, the largest ones located at the south. The majority of the rivers belong to the Ob basin, many of them falling in dead lakes. Among the main lakes are Chany, Sartlan, Tandovo and Ubinskoye.

===Natural resources===
As of 2007, the oil reserves of the region amounted to 204 million tons. In addition, Novosibirsk Oblast had free gas reserves of 600 million cubic meters, solute gas reserves of 5.2 billion cubic meters, and gas condensate reserves of 121,000 tons. Most of the oil and gas reserves are located in the Severny and Kyshtovsky districts.

The following metals can be found in the region: zirconium dioxide (0.7 million tons), titanium dioxide (2.9 million tons), bauxite (2,068,000 tons), and tin (588,000 tons). In addition, there are twenty-three fields of alluvial placer gold in the region (nineteen of which were being developed and prospected in 2006) and seven residual soil gold fields suitable for open-cut mining in the southeast.

Novosibirsk Oblast has 5.527 million tons of high-quality anthracite, as well as 2.720 million tons of long-flame and coking coal. Most of these are located in the Iskitim and Toguchin districts. The north part of the region also has peat fields with estimated reserves of 7.6 billion tons.
Prospected mineral water reserves in the region amount to 6,948 cubic meters per day. The popular Karachinskaya mineral water originates from the region.

The oblast has 4,531,800 hectares or 45,318 square kilometres of forests, with 509.88 million cubic meters of timber reserves. Most of the region&#x27;s forests consist of softwood. Softwood forests cover an area of 3,481,300 hectares or 34,813 square kilometres, while softwood timber is spread out over 387.96 million cubic meters. Coniferous forests - located mostly near the Ob River and the Salair Ridge - cover an area of 1,011,900 hectares or 10,119 square kilometres with timber reserves of 121.39 million cubic meters. The economic potential of the forests is reduced by the fact that most of them are located in the north of the region, in areas that are difficult to access.

===Climate===
Novosibirsk Oblast has a continental climate. Average temperature is in January and in July. Annual precipitation is .

==History==
During the Middle Ages the region was populated by Siberian Tatar tribes (Baraba and Chat). Being constantly raided by Kalmyk nomads throughout the first centuries of the exploration of Siberia future Novosibirsk Oblast did not attract many Russian colonists, who preferred to settle around more northerly Tomsk. The first Russian village Maslyanino was founded in 1644. In 1716, officer Ivan Butkeyev built the Berd fortress that later became the city of Berdsk, the main center of future colonization and development of the region. Like many other parts of Siberia, the Berd lands became a safe haven for political dissents, fugitive serfs and religious sects from all across Russia.

For the most parts of its history, the Novosibirsk Oblast belonged to the Tomsk administration, initially as a part of the Tomsk uyezd of the Tobolsk Governorate and later, starting with 1804, the separate Tomsk Governorate. The turning point in history of the region was the construction of the Trans-Siberian and the Turkestan–Siberian railways. Founded in 1893, Novosibirsk, then Novonikolayevsk, became a transport hub of sub-regional importance and surpassed other major Siberian cities like Omsk and Tomsk in mere decades. In 1920, the capital of the Tomsk Governorate was moved to Novonikolayevsk, in 1921 the Novonikolayevsk Governorate was established. In 1925, most of the Siberian governorates were united as the Siberian Krai with Novosibirsk as the capital. In 1930, it was split into West Siberian (Novosibirsk) and East Siberian (Irkutsk) krais, the former existed until 1937. The Novosibirsk Oblast was finally established on September 28, 1937. Kemerovo and Tomsk became separate from it only in 1943–1944.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Novosibirsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually governor were appointed/elected alongside the elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Novosibirsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Novosibirsk Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

<text>Omsk Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located in southwestern Siberia. The oblast has an area of . Its population is 1,977,665 (2010 Census) with the majority, 1.12 million, living in Omsk, the administrative center.

The oblast borders Tyumen Oblast in the north and west, Novosibirsk Oblast and Tomsk Oblast in the east, and Kazakhstan in the south.

==Etymology==
Omsk Oblast is named after the Om river. This hydronym in the dialect of Baraba Tatars means &quot;the quiet one&quot;.

==Geography==
Omsk Oblast shares borders with Kazakhstan (North Kazakhstan Region and Pavlodar Region) to the south, Tyumen Oblast in the west and Novosibirsk Oblast and Tomsk Oblast in the east. It is included in the Siberian Federal District.

The territory stretches for from north to south and from west to east. The main water artery is the Irtysh River and its tributaries the Ishim, Om, Osha, and Tara Rivers. The region is located in the West Siberian Plain, consisting of mostly flat terrain. In the south is the Ishim Plain, gradually turning into steppe, forest and swampy taiga to the north. The soil is sandy and silty. Along the Irtysh River, in t. N. Irtysh region, there is an &quot;oasis&quot; microclimate, with a wooded landscape and gullies. There, the most fertile land in the region can be found. The Omsk region contains many lakes, the largest of which are Tenis-Saltaim, Ik, Ebeyty, Ulzhay and Tobol-Kushly.

The highest elevation in the Omsk region - about Upland village, the lowest elevation is the water&#x27;s edge on the Irtysh - , near the village of Little Beach. 

The property is located in Omsk region 28 specially protected natural territories of regional destinations. Including parks in Bolshereche and Omsk (&quot;Bird&#x27;s harbor&quot;). 

===Climate===

The southern plains have notably longer and warmer summers and a delayed onset of freezing temperatures. They are also significantly drier than the northern forests, receiving only precipitation annually. Winters, however, are as severe on the plains as they are further north. Spring rains are rare, but late spring freezes are not. The early part of the summer is frequently dominated by hot, dry southern winds.

===Ecology===
 on the territory of the Omsk region, there are 35 areas that have the status of protected areas (PAs), regional and local importance.

==History==

===Prehistory and the Middle Ages===
Archeological findings indicate that the present day territory of the oblast has been inhabited for the last 14,000 years. Neolithic societies in the area lived by fishing and hunting. About three thousand years ago, pastoralism began to take hold. Ust&#x27;-Ishim man, the remains of a man that lived 45,000 years ago, was discovered in Omsk Oblast.

Various Turkic states dominated the area throughout the Medieval era. The most notable of these were the Western Turkic Khaganate and the Siberian Khanate. Siberian Tatars, Mongols, Khanty and Mansi tribes, along with others, inhabited the territory.

===Exploration of Siberia===
The Russian history of Omsk began with the 1584 arrival of a Cossack force under the command of ataman Yermak Timofeyevich, who defeated local rulers and established nominal Russian control of the area. To support further expansion tsars Feodor I and Boris Godunov initiated the construction of fortified settlements and military outposts in the south of Siberia in order to defend their subjects from raiding nomadic tribesmen and to exert authority over local populations, specifically over the tribute-paying Siberian Tatars of The Baraba Lands. The first permanent Russian settlement in the region, the city of Tara, was founded in 1594, soon it began to play an important part in fur trade that connected Russia with Central Asia and China.

In 1716 a fortress was constructed at the confluence of the Om and Irtysh rivers on the orders of sublieutenant Ivan Bugholtz. The fortress would form the nucleus for the development of the future city of Omsk. By the second half of the 18th century, Omsk fortress was the largest building of any kind in the eastern part of Russia.

As Russian settlements continued to spread through the Yenisei, Tobol and Irtysh watersheds in the course of the 18th century, so did the development of the Omsk and the surrounding region. In 1753 a customs post was established to tax goods brought into the city by the ever-increasing trade with Kazakh tribesmen. In 1764, when the Siberian provinces of Russia were organized into two governorates with centers in Irkutsk and Tobolsk, the city of Tara and the fortress of Omsk were assigned to the latter. In 1780, on the orders of Catherine the Great the fortress was transferred to Kolyvan Oblast. By this time Omsk had grown to the size of a small city, however, from 1797 to 1804 it did not possess its own uyezd.

===Russian Empire===
In 1804, the territories surrounding Omsk were organized into the Omsk Okrug. The city rose to prominence when Siberia was once again reorganized in 1822, Omsk became the administrative center of the General Governorate of Eastern Siberia rising above the old center of Siberia, Tobolsk. The new governorate was divided into oblasts around the cities of Omsk, Petropavlovsk, Semipalatinsk and Ust-Kamenogrsk populated by Russian colonists and okrugs populated by Kazakh nomads. In subsequent reforms the name of the Oblast was changed repeatedly to The Oblast of The Siberian Kyrgyz (1854), Akmolinsk Oblast (1868), and Omsk Oblast (1917) before finally reverting to the Omsk Governorate in 1918. The authority of the oblast followed further expansion of the empire to Central Asia and included significant parts of modern-day Kazakhstan.

In the 19th century, Omsk, given its strong system of frontier fortresses, became notorious as a premier destination for political exiles and prisoners from the European part of the Russian Empire. Decembrists, Polish rebels, French prisoners of war and political activists of every stripe found their way to Siberia. Among them was Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who spent four years (1850–1854) at the Omsk prison.

The early nineteenth century also saw the growth of industry in the city and in the rest of the Irtysh basin. The Siberian Cossack Army was headquartered in Omsk after 1808 and contributed to the development of the city, by the beginning of the 20th century the Cossacks were a dominant component in the society of both the city of Omsk and the surrounding lands, having reached a population of 174 thousand and holding title to five million hectares of agricultural land. The 18th and 19th centuries also saw the influx of a significant number of German immigrants both from Russia&#x27;s Volga Regions and from abroad.

===Soviet years===
In 1925 the Omsk governorate was dissolved into the newly formed Siberian Krai and again reorganized, this time as an Oblast by order of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on 7 December 1934. Parts of the Ob-Irtysh Oblast and the West Siberian Krai as well as the southern part of Chelyabinsk Oblast were given over to Omsk. In 1943, Kurgan Oblast created from the western portion of the Chelyabinsk Oblast also got a number of Omsk territories. In 1944, the northern part of the Omsk Oblast along with the districts previously transferred to Kurgan became newly established Tyumen Oblast that included Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets autonomous okrugs.

The 1950s saw the creation of the petroleum processing industry, as well as the development of various high-technology facilities that came to define the economy of the Oblast for the remainder of the century.

===Post-Soviet era===
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union the oblast became part of the newly independent Russian Federation. The independence of Kazakhstan gave Omsk an international border to the south, while continued federal policy aiming to rectify the effects of Stalin era population transfers led to the creation of a national German district in an area with a significant, although not a majority, German population around the town of Azovo. On 19 May 1996 Omsk Oblast signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 21 December 2001.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Omsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The politics in the oblast is governed by the Charter of Omsk Oblast. The laws within the authority of the oblast are passed by the Legislative Assembly of Omsk Oblast which is the legislative (representative) body. The highest executive body is the Omsk Oblast Administration. It also includes the executive bodies of the subdivisions such as districts, and is responsible for the daily administration. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the head of the oblast and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

As of 18 January 2019, the departmental register of registered non-profit organizations of the Office of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation for the Omsk Oblast contains information on 2537 non-profit organizations, including 1332 public associations (national associations - 60, regional branches of political parties - 46, trade unions - 328, children&#x27;s and youth public associations - 55), 308 religious organizations, 30 Cossack societies, and 20 public associations of Cossacks. For example, in the Omsk Oblast there are regional branches of the political parties United Russia, A Just Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and others.

<text>Kemerovo Oblast (, ), also known as Kuzbass (, ), after the Kuznetsk Basin, is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Kemerovo is the administrative center and largest city of the oblast. Kemerovo Oblast is one of Russia&#x27;s most urbanized regions, with over 70% of the population living in its nine principal cities. Its ethnic composition is predominantly Russian, but native Shors and Kalmak Siberian Tatars also live in the oblast, along with Ukrainians, Volga Tatars, and Chuvash. The population recorded during the 2021 Census was 2,600,923.

==Geography==
Kemerovo Oblast is located in southwestern Siberia, where the West Siberian Plain meets the South Siberian Mountains. The oblast, which covers an area of , shares a border with Tomsk Oblast in the north, Krasnoyarsk Krai and the Republic of Khakassia in the east, the Altai Republic in the south, and with Novosibirsk Oblast and Altai Krai in the west.
Verkhny Zub peak, the highest point of the oblast, is located in the eastern border.

===Climate===
The climate of the oblast is continental: winters are cold and long, summers are warm, but short. The average January temperature ranges from , the average in July is . Average annual precipitation ranges from on the plains and the foothills of up to or more in mountainous areas. The duration of the frost-free period is 100 days in the north area, and up to 120 days in the south of the Kuznetsk Basin.

===Environment===
The environmental conditions in Kuznetsk Basin are heavily influenced by the regional industrial activities, especially, by coal mining. The report about the environmental conditions in Kemerovo region from 2014 indicated that there are more than 20 thousand of enterprises, emitting more than 250 types of atmospheric pollutants, where most urban areas with the worst air quality are located in the Kuznetsk Basin: Novokuznetsk, Mezhdurechensk, Myski, Kaltan, Polysaevo, Belovo and Leninsk-Kuznetskiy.

Atmospheric pollution is apparent over Kuznetsk Basin as major regional long-term tropospheric NO2 anomaly was identified over the region in 2006-2020 years. The anomaly was driven primarily by coal mining and processing activities in the region, being exacerbated by the regional topography, favorable for accumulation of atmospheric pollutants and metal production in Novokuznetsk. Unlike other Siberian cities, where atmospheric concentration of NO2 has been decreasing in recent years, the concentration of NO2 is increasing in the cities of the Kuznetsk Basin due to the increasing coal production in the region.

==History==
The oblast was established on January 26, 1943, but it has considerably older antecedents. Shors, Teleuts and Siberian Tatars are native peoples of the region. The oldest city in Kemerovo Oblast is Novokuznetsk, founded in 1618, soon after Cossack ataman Yermak&#x27;s push into Siberia.

The territory of modern Kemerovo Oblast has been inhabited for several thousand years. In 1618, Kuznetsk fort was established in the south of the future oblast to protect the land from Russian and Mongolian Dzhungarian invaders. During the 19th century, the territory of the modern oblast was a part of Tomsk Governorate.

===Soviet period===
After the October Revolution of 1917, Kuzbass experienced significant strife as part of the Russian Civil War. A major peasant rebellion took place in the region in early 1921, but was suppressed by the Red Army. In 1930, Kuzbass became part of the West Siberian Krai, and then the Novosibirsk Oblast. Post revolutionary period was characterized by the transition to a planned economy, the creation of the Ural-Kuzbass industrial complex development of the coal, metallurgical and chemical industries Kuzbass Kemerovo Coke built, Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, a lot of new mines. Industrial enterprises are being built near the workers&#x27; settlements, which quickly became a city: Kiselevsk Osinniki Krasnobrodsky, Tashtagol Kaltan Mezhdurechensk and others.

During the Great Patriotic War, Kemerovo region became a major supplier of coal and metal. From Novokuznetsk steel produced over 50,000 tanks and 45,000 aircraft. In Kuzbass from the occupied areas were evacuated equipment 71 enterprises, most of which have remained in the Kuzbass.

In January 26, 1943, the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet issued a decree, decided to allocate from the Novosibirsk Oblast of Kuzbass and the establishment on its territory of Kemerovo region with administrative center in the city of Kemerovo. In the new Oblast included 17.5% of the Novosibirsk region, 9 of the 12 cities of regional subordination, 17 of the 20 workers&#x27; settlements, 23 of the 75 districts. The population of the Kemerovo Oblast was 42% of the total population of the Novosibirsk Oblast.

Aeroflot Flight 593 crashed into a mountain range in the Kemerovo Oblast in 1994.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kemerovo CPSU Committee (who in reality had the highest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After the abolition of Article 6 of the Constitution of the USSR in March 1990, the CPSU lost its monopoly on power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Kemerovo Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Kemerovo Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Administrative divisions==
==Economy==

The northern area of the region is more agricultural. The region has a dense railway network, including the Trans-Siberian Railway, which passes through the oblast. Novokuznetsk is the center of the engineering industry.

Kemerovo Oblast is one of Russia&#x27;s most important industrial regions, with some of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of coal. The south of the region is dominated by metallurgy and the mining industry, as well as mechanical engineering and chemical production.

The Evraz Group and an ore subsidiary Evrazruda operate iron ore mining and processing facilities along with the Raspadskaya, Yuzhkuzbassugol, the Siberian holding company SIBPLAZ. Coal and coking coal mines are located there. Prokopevsk, Kiselevsk, and Andzhero-Sudzhensk are coal-producing centers.
The Zhernovskoye coal mine has reserves amounting to 163 million tonnes of coking coal. In November 2021, the Listvyazhnaya mine disaster took place, in which many people were trapped.

<text>Krasnoyarsk Krai (, ) is a federal subject (a krai) of Russia located in Siberia. Its administrative center is the city of Krasnoyarsk, the second-largest city in Siberia after Novosibirsk. Comprising half of the Siberian Federal District, Krasnoyarsk Krai is the largest krai in Russia, the second-largest federal subject in the country after neighboring Sakha, and the third-largest country subdivision by area in the world. The krai covers an area of , constituting roughly 13% of Russia&#x27;s total area. Krasnoyarsk Krai has a population of 2,856,971 as of the 2021 census.

==Geography==

The krai lies in the middle of Siberia, and occupies nearly half of the Siberian Federal District, almost splitting it in half, stretching from the Sayan Mountains in the south along the Yenisei River to the Taymyr Peninsula in the north. It borders (counting clockwise from the sea) the Sakha Republic, Irkutsk, the Tuva Republic, the Republic of Khakassia, Kemerovo, Tomsk, Tyumen Oblasts, the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and the Kara Sea and Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean in the north.

The krai is located in the basin of the Arctic Ocean; a great number of rivers that flow through the krai drain into it eventually. The main rivers of the krai are the Yenisei, and its tributaries (from south to north): the Kan, the Angara, the Podkamennaya Tunguska, the Nizhnyaya Tunguska and the Tanama.

There are also several thousand lakes in the krai. The largest lakes include Beloye, Belyo, Glubokoye, Itat, Khantayskoye, Labas, Lama, Pyasina, Taymyr, and Yessey. The rivers and lakes are rich in fish.

The climate is strongly continental with large temperature variations during the year. Long winters and short, hot summers are characteristic for the central and southern regions where most of the krai&#x27;s population lives. The territory of Krasnoyarsk Krai experiences conditions of three climate belts: arctic, subarctic, and humid continental. In the north there are less than 40 days with temperature above , while in the south there are 110–120 such days.

The average temperature in January is in the north and in the south. The average temperature in July is in the north – where the most poleward tree line in the world is found at Ary-Mas – and in the south. The annual precipitation is (up to in the foothills of the Sayan Mountains). Snow covers the central regions of the krai from early November until late March. The peaks of the Sayan Mountains higher than and those of the Putorana Plateau higher than are covered with permanent snow. Permafrost is absent at low altitudes south of Lesosibirsk, but as one moves north it grades from sporadic around the 58th parallel to extensive discontinuous around the 60th parallel and continuous north of the 63rd parallel.

The coastline contains several prominent peninsulas – from west to east the main ones are the Minina Peninsula, Mikhailov Peninsula, the Taymyr Peninsula (by far the largest, and itself containing the Zarya Peninsula, Oskara Peninsula and Chelyuskin Peninsula) and the Khara-Tumus Peninsula.

There are also a large number of islands off the krai&#x27;s coast, the most prominent of which are (from west to east) Sibiryakov Island, Nosok Island, Dikson Island, Vern Island, Brekhovskiye Island (in the Yenisei Gulf), Krestovskiy Island, the Kamennye Islands, the Zveroboy Islands, the Labyrintovye Islands, the Plavnikovye Islands, Kolosovykh Island, the Mona Islands, Rykacheva Island, Gavrilova Island, Belukha and Prodolgovatyy Islands, the Nordenskiöld Archipelago, the Firnley Islands, the Heiberg Islands, Starokadomsky Island, Maly Taymyr Island, the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands, the Faddey Islands, and the Saint Peter Islands. There are also a number of islands further out that fall under the administration of Krasnoyarsk Krai – the most prominent being Bolshoy Island, Sverdrup Island, the Izvestiy TSIK Islands, the Arkticheskiy Institut Islands, the Kirov Islands, Uyedineniya Island, Voronina Island, Severnaya Zemlya (the largest group), and Ushakov Island.
The highest point of the krai is Grandiozny Peak in the Eastern Sayan Mountains at an elevation of .

In the south there is a Ergaki Nature Park which is a protected area of Krasnoyarsk Krai. It contains the Western Sayan Mountains. The park was established in 2005 and it covers an area of . It is bordered by the Yenisei highway.

==History==

According to archaeologists, the first people reached Siberia circa 40,000 BC. The Andronovo culture, a group of Bronze Age peoples, lived in the area around 2000–900 BC, the remains of which were discovered in 1914 near the village of Andronovo, Uzhursky District. The grave-mounds and monuments of the Scythian culture in Krasnoyarsk Krai belong to the 7th century BC and are some of the oldest in Eurasia. A prince&#x27;s grave, the Kurgan Arshan, discovered in 2001, is also located in the krai.

Russian settlement of the area (mostly by Cossacks) began in the 17th century. After the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway the Russian colonization of the area strongly increased. In 1822, the Yeniseysk Governorate was created with Krasnoyarsk as its administrative center that covered territory very similar to that of the current krai.

During both the Tsarist and the Soviet times, the territory of Krasnoyarsk Krai was used as a place of exile of political enemies, actual or alleged. The first leaders of the Soviet state, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, were exiled to what is now the krai in 1897–1900 and 1903, respectively. In Stalin&#x27;s era, numerous Gulag camps were located in the region.

On June 30, 1908, in the basin of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River, there occurred a powerful explosion most likely to have been caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of above the Earth&#x27;s surface. The force of the explosion is estimated to be about 10–15 megatons. It flattened more than of pine forest and killed thousands of reindeer.

Krasnoyarsk Krai was created in 1934 after disaggregation of the West Siberian and East Siberian Krais and later included Taymyr and Evenk Autonomous Okrugs and Khakas Autonomous Oblast. In 1991, Khakassia separated from the krai and became a republic within the Russian Federation. On January 1, 2007, following a referendum on the issue held on April 17, 2005, the territories of Evenk and Taymyr Autonomous Okrugs were merged into the krai.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Krasnoyarsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most authority), the chairman of the krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the krai Executive Committee (executive power). Since the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the demise of the CPSU, the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor has been appointed or elected alongside the elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Krasnoyarsk Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Krasnoyarsk Krai is the province&#x27;s regional standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The legislative assembly consists of 52 deputies. 22 of them are elected in 22 one-mandate electoral districts by plurality system, 2 in Taymyr, 2 in Evenkia, and 26 are elected by proportional system from the lists offered by political parties. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

In December 1991, president Boris Yeltsin appointed Arkady Veprev as the first governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In January 1993 Yeltsin appointed Valery Zubov as the second governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In Krasnoyarsk Territory governor elections were called. Zubov was elected in a universal election for a five-year term. The Legislative Assembly of Krasnoyarsk Krai was created as well.

In 1998, Zubov lost in the gubernatorial election to General Aleksandr Lebed, a well-known politician in all of Russia. In 2002 Lebed died in a helicopter accident.

In 2002, Alexander Khloponin, the governor of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug and an influential businessman, was elected a governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In 2007, he was nominated by president Vladimir Putin for re-election, and the legislative assembly elected Khloponin for the second term.

In 2010, after Khloponin was promoted to the office of the president&#x27;s envoy in the North Caucasian Federal District, Lev Kuznetsov, a businessman and politician from Khloponin&#x27;s circle, became the new governor of the krai. After Kuznetsov, Viktor Tolokonsky became Governor September 2017. After Tolokonsky, Aleksandr Uss became the Governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai where he remains in the role today.

Krasnoyarsk Krai is represented in the Federation Council of Russia, the upper house of the Russian parliament by two senators. In 2007, eight deputies were elected to the State Duma from Krasnoyarsk regional lists of different political parties.

<doc id="87624" wikidata="Q104081" url="?curid=87624" title="Mickey Rooney">
<text>Mickey Rooney (born Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr.; other pseudonym Mickey Maguire; September 23, 1920 – April 6, 2014) was an American actor. In a career spanning nearly nine decades, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent-film era. He was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941, and one of the best-paid actors of that era. At the height of a career ultimately marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized the mainstream United States self-image.

At the peak of his career between ages 15 and 25, he made 43 films, and was one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s most consistently successful actors. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney &quot;the best there has ever been&quot;. Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles in &quot;National Velvet&quot; and &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, said Rooney was &quot;the closest thing to a genius&quot; with whom he had ever worked. He won a Golden Globe Award in 1982 and an Emmy Award in the same year for the title role in a television movie &quot;Bill&quot; and was awarded the Academy Honorary Award in 1982.

Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child actor, and made his film debut at the age of six. He played the title character in the &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; series of 78 short films, from age seven to 13. At 14 and 15, he played Puck in the play and subsequent film adaptation of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. At the age of 16, he began playing Andy Hardy, and gained his first recognition at 17 as Whitey Marsh in &quot;Boys Town.&quot; At only 19, Rooney became the second-youngest Best Actor in a Leading Role nominee and the first teenager to be nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as Mickey Moran in 1939 film adaptation of coming-of-age Broadway musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot;; he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. Rooney received his second Academy Award nomination in the same category for his role as Homer Macauley in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;.

Drafted into the military during World War II, Rooney served nearly two years, entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio. He was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles, but too short at for most adult roles, and was unable to gain as many starring roles. However, numerous low-budget, but critically well-received pictures through the mid-1950s had Rooney playing lead dramatic roles in what were later regarded as films noir. Rooney&#x27;s career was renewed with well-received supporting performances in films such as &quot;The Bold and the Brave&quot; (1956), &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962), &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979). Rooney received Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1957 for &quot;The Bold and the Brave&quot;, and 1980 for &quot;The Black Stallion&quot;. In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;, a role that earned him nominations for Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. He made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows.

== Early life and acting background ==
Rooney was born Ninnian Joseph Yule, Jr., in Brooklyn, New York on September 23, 1920, the only child of Nellie W. Carter and Joe Yule. His mother was an American former chorus girl and burlesque performer from Kansas City, Missouri, while his father was a Scottish-born vaudevillian, who had emigrated to New York from Glasgow with his family at the age of three months. They lived in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. When Rooney was born, his parents were appearing together in a Brooklyn production of &quot;A Gaiety Girl&quot;. He later recounted in his memoirs that he began performing at the age of 17 months as part of his parents&#x27; routine, wearing a specially tailored tuxedo.

== Career ==
=== 1924–1926: Career beginnings as a child actor ===
Rooney&#x27;s parents separated when he was four years old in 1924, and he and his mother moved to Hollywood the following year. He made his first film appearance at age six in 1926, in the short &quot;Not to be Trusted&quot;. Rooney got bit parts in films such as &quot;The Beast of the City&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Life of Jimmy Dolan&quot; (1933), which allowed him to work alongside stars such as Joel McCrea, Colleen Moore, Clark Gable, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Wayne, and Jean Harlow. He enrolled in the Hollywood Professional School and later attended Fairfax High School.

=== 1927–1936: Mickey McGuire ===
His mother saw an advertisement for a child to play the role of &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; in a series of short films. Rooney got the role and became &quot;Mickey&quot; for 78 of the films, running from 1927 to 1936, starting with &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1927), his first starring role. During this period, he also briefly voiced Oswald the Lucky Rabbit for Walter Lantz Productions. He made other films in his adolescence, including several more of the McGuire films. At age 14, he played the role of Puck in the Warner Bros. all-star adaptation of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1935. Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as &quot;one of the cinema&#x27;s most arresting pieces of magic&quot;. Rooney then moved to MGM, where he befriended Judy Garland, with whom he began making a series of musicals that propelled both of them to stardom.

=== 1937–1944: Andy Hardy films and Hollywood stardom ===

In 1937, Rooney was selected to portray Andy Hardy in &quot;A Family Affair&quot;, which MGM had planned as a B-movie. Rooney provided comic relief as the son of Judge James K. Hardy, portrayed by Lionel Barrymore (although former silent-film leading man Lewis Stone played the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent pictures). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.

According to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooney&#x27;s character portrayed a typical &quot;anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager&quot;, and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as &quot;sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable,&quot; their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a &quot;comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times&quot;, with Rooney instilling &quot;a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like&quot;.

Behind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the &quot;hyperactive girl-crazy teenager&quot; he portrayed on the screen. Wallace Beery, his co-star in &quot;Stablemates&quot;, described him as a &quot;brat&quot;, but a &quot;fine actor&quot;. MGM head Louis B. Mayer found it necessary to manage Rooney&#x27;s public image, explains historian Jane Ellen Wayne:

Fifty years later, Rooney realized in hindsight that these early confrontations with Mayer were necessary for him to develop into a leading film star: &quot;Everybody butted heads with him, but he listened and you listened. And then you&#x27;d come to an agreement you could both live with. ... He visited the sets, he gave people talks ... What he wanted was something that was &quot;American&quot;, presented in a cosmopolitan manner.&quot;

In 1937, Rooney made his first film alongside Judy Garland with &quot;Thoroughbreds Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. Garland and Rooney became close friends as they co-starred in future films and became a successful song-and-dance team. Audiences delighted in seeing the &quot;playful interactions between the two stars showcase a wonderful chemistry&quot;. Along with three of the &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; films, where she portrayed a girl attracted to Andy, they appeared together in a string of successful musicals, including coming-of-age musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; (1939). For his performance as Mickey Moran, 19-year-old Mickey Rooney was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, becoming the second-youngest Best Actor nominee. During an interview in the 1992 documentary film &quot;MGM: When the Lion Roars&quot;, Rooney describes their friendship:

In 1937, Rooney received top billing as Shockey Carter in &quot;Hoosier Schoolboy&quot;, but his breakthrough role as a dramatic actor came in 1938&#x27;s &quot;Boys Town&quot; opposite Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan, who runs a home for wayward and homeless boys. 18-year-old Rooney and 17-year-old Deanna Durbin were awarded a special Juvenile Academy Award in 1939, for &quot;significant contribution in bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth&quot;. Jane Ellen Wayne describes one of the &quot;most famous scenes&quot; in the film, where tough young Rooney is playing poker with a cigarette in his mouth, his hat is cocked, and his feet are up on the table. &quot;Tracy grabs him by the lapels, throws the cigarette away, and pushes him into a chair. &#x27;That&#x27;s better,&#x27; he tells Mickey.&quot; Louis B. Mayer said &quot;Boys Town&quot; was his favorite film during his years at MGM.

Rooney was the biggest box-office draw in 1939, 1940, and 1941. For their roles in &quot;Boys Town&quot;, Rooney and Tracy won first and second place in the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; 1940 National Poll of Exhibitors, based on the box-office appeal of 200 players. A contributor to &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Congratulations to Messrs. Rooney and Tracy! Also to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer we extend a hearty thanks for their very considerable part in this outstanding achievement.&quot; Actor Laurence Olivier once called Rooney &quot;the greatest actor of them all&quot;. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1940, timed to coincide with the release of &quot;Young Tom Edison&quot;; the cover story began:

During his long career, Rooney also worked with many of the screen&#x27;s female stars, including Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944), Marilyn Monroe in &quot;The Fireball&quot; (1950), Grace Kelly in &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (1954)and Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961). Rooney&#x27;s &quot;bumptiousness and boyish charm&quot; as an actor developed more &quot;smoothness and polish&quot; over the years, writes biographer Scott Eyman. The fact that Rooney fully enjoyed his life as an actor played a large role in those changes:
Clarence Brown, who directed Rooney in his Oscar-nominated performance in &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943) and again in &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1944), enjoyed working with Rooney in films:

=== Military service and later film career ===

In June 1944, Rooney was inducted into the United States Army. He served more than 21 months (until shortly after the end of World War II), entertaining the troops in America and Europe in Special Services Jeep Shows. He spent part of the time as a radio personality on the American Forces Network, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for entertaining troops in combat zones. In addition, Rooney also received the Army Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal, for his military service.

Rooney&#x27;s career declined after his return to civilian life. He was now an adult with a height of only according to his 1942 draft registration (popularly reported as ), and he could no longer play the role of a teenager, but he also lacked the stature of a leading man. He appeared in the film &quot;Words and Music&quot; in 1948, which paired him for the last time with Garland on film (he appeared with her on one episode as a guest on &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;). He briefly starred in a CBS radio series, &quot;Shorty Bell&quot;, in the summer of 1948, and reprised his role as Andy Hardy, with most of the original cast, in a syndicated radio version of &quot;The Hardy Family&quot; in 1949 and 1950 (repeated on Mutual during 1952).

In 1949, &quot;Variety&quot; reported a renegotiation of Rooney&#x27;s deal with MGM. He agreed to make one film a year for them for five years at $25,000 a movie (his fee until then had been $100,000, but Rooney wanted to enter independent production.) Rooney claimed he was unhappy with the billing MGM gave him for &quot;Words and Music&quot;, but his career was at a low point. His &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary reported, &quot;at one point in 1950, the only job he could get was touring Southern states with the Hadacol Caravan&quot;, promoting a patent medicine that was later forced off the market.

His first television series, &quot;The Mickey Rooney Show&quot;, also known as &quot;Hey, Mulligan&quot;, was created by Blake Edwards with Rooney as his own producer, and appeared on NBC television for 32 episodes from August 1954 to June 1955. In 1951, he made his directorial debut with &quot;My True Story&quot;, starring Helen Walker. Rooney also starred as a ragingly egomaniacal television comedian, in the live 90-minute television drama &quot;The Comedian&quot;, in the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; series on the evening of Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1957, and as himself in a 1960 revue called &quot;The Musical Revue of 1959&quot;, based on the 1929 film &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;. In May 1956, Sequoia University awarded Rooney an honorary degree of PhD in Fine Arts for his work.

In 1958, Rooney joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in hosting an episode of NBC&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Club Oasis&quot; comedy and variety show. In 1960, Rooney directed and starred in &quot;The Private Lives of Adam and Eve&quot;, an ambitious comedy known for its multiple flashbacks and many cameos. In the 1960s, Rooney returned to theatrical entertainment. He accepted film roles in undistinguished films, but still appeared in better works, such as &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).

He portrayed a Japanese character, Mr. Yunioshi, in the 1961 film version of Truman Capote&#x27;s novella &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. When his performance was criticized by some in subsequent years as a racist caricature, Rooney contended that he would not have taken the role if he had known it would offend people.

In 1961, Rooney appeared on television&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and mentioned that he had already started enrolling students in the Mickey Rooney School of Entertainment. His school venture never came to fruition. This was a period of professional distress for Rooney; as a childhood friend, director Richard Quine put it: &quot;Let&#x27;s face it. It wasn&#x27;t all that easy to find roles for a 5-foot-3 man who&#x27;d passed the age of Andy Hardy.&quot; In 1962, although he had earned $12 million by that point, his debts and multiple divorces had forced him into filing for bankruptcy.

In 1966, Rooney was working on the film &quot;Ambush Bay&quot; in the Philippines when his wife Barbara Ann Thomason—a former model and aspiring actress who had won 17 straight beauty contests in Southern California—was found dead in her bed in Los Angeles. Her lover, Milos Milos—who was one of Rooney&#x27;s actor-friends—was found dead beside her. Detectives ruled it a murder-suicide, which was committed with Rooney&#x27;s own gun.

Francis Ford Coppola had bought the rights to make &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979), and when casting it, he called Rooney and asked him if he thought he could play a jockey. Rooney replied saying, &quot;Gee, I don&#x27;t know. I never played a jockey before.&quot; He was kidding, he said, since he had played a jockey in at least three past films, including &quot;Down the Stretch&quot;, &quot;Thoroughbreds Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, and &quot;National Velvet&quot;. The film garnered excellent reviews and earned $40 million in its first run, which gave Coppola&#x27;s struggling studio, American Zoetrope, a significant boost. It also gave Rooney newfound recognition, along with an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1983, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Rooney their Academy Honorary Award for his lifetime of achievement.

=== Character roles and Broadway comeback ===

==== Television roles ====


In addition to his movie roles, Rooney made numerous guest-starring roles as a television character actor for nearly six decades, beginning with an episode of &quot;Celanese Theatre&quot;. The part led to other roles on such television series as &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Hennesey&quot;, &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot; (1964), &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (1963), &quot;Combat!&quot; (1964), &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot; (1966), &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1970), &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970), &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1970), &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; (1995), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1988) among many others.

In 1961, he guest-starred in the 13-week James Franciscus adventure–drama CBS television series &quot;The Investigators&quot;. In 1962, he was cast as himself in the episode &quot;The Top Banana&quot; of the CBS sitcom, &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, starring Harry Morgan and Cara Williams.

In 1963, he entered CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, giving a one-man performance in the episode &quot;The Last Night of a Jockey&quot; (1963). Also in 1963, in &#x27;The Hunt&#x27; for &quot;Suspense Theater&quot;, he played the sadistic sheriff hunting the young surfer played by James Caan. In 1964, he launched another half-hour sitcom, &quot;Mickey&quot;. The story line had &quot;Mickey&quot; operating a resort hotel in Southern California. His own son Tim Rooney appeared as his character&#x27;s teenaged son on this program, and Emmaline Henry starred as Rooney&#x27;s wife. The program lasted for 17 episodes.

When Norman Lear was developing &quot;All in the Family&quot; in 1970, he wanted Rooney for the lead role of Archie Bunker. Rooney turned Lear down, and the role eventually went to Carroll O&#x27;Connor.

Rooney garnered a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special for his role in 1981&#x27;s &quot;Bill&quot;. Playing opposite Dennis Quaid, Rooney&#x27;s character was a mentally handicapped man attempting to live on his own after leaving an institution. His acting quality in the film has been favorably compared to other actors who took on similar roles, including Sean Penn, Dustin Hoffman, and Tom Hanks. He reprised his role in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Bill: On His Own&quot;, earning an Emmy nomination for the turn. He appeared on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; S6 E11 &quot;A Christmas Presence&quot; as Angelorum Dominicus (a guardian angel character). His wife Jan Rooney played Sister Bernadette, a nun with a beautiful singing voice. The episode aired on December 18, 1982.

Rooney did voice acting from time to time. He provided the voice of Santa Claus in four stop-motion animated Christmas TV specials: &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; (1970), &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot; (1974), &quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July&quot; (1979) and &quot;A Miser Brothers&#x27; Christmas&quot; (2008). In 1995, he appeared as himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;.

After starring in one unsuccessful TV series and turning down an offer for a huge TV series, Rooney, now 70, starred in the Family Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of the Black Stallion&quot;, where he reprised his role as Henry Dailey in the film of the same name, 11 years earlier. The series ran for three years and was an international hit.

Rooney appeared in television commercials for Garden State Life Insurance Company in 2002.

==== Broadway shows ====
A major turning point came in 1979, when Rooney made his Broadway debut in the acclaimed stage play &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;, a musical revue tribute to the burlesque era co-starring former MGM dancing star Ann Miller. Aljean Harmetz noted, &quot;Mr. Rooney fought over every skit and argued over every song and almost always got things done his way. The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1979, to rave reviews, and this time he did not throw success away. Rooney and Miller performed the show 1,208 times in New York and then toured with it for five years, including eight months in London. Co-star Miller recalls that Rooney &quot;never missed a performance or a chance to ad-lib or read the lines the same way twice, if he even stuck to the script&quot;. Biographer Alvin Marill states, &quot;at 59, Mickey Rooney was reincarnated as a baggy-pants comedian—back as a top banana in show biz in his belated Broadway debut.&quot; For his performance, Rooney received nominations for Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical.

Following this, he toured as Pseudelous in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. In the 1990s, he returned to Broadway for the final months of &quot;Will Rogers Follies&quot;, playing the ghost of Will&#x27;s father. On television, he starred in the short-lived sitcom, &quot;One of the Boys&quot;, along with two unfamiliar young stars, Dana Carvey and Nathan Lane, in 1982.

He toured Canada in a dinner theater production of &quot;The Mind with the Naughty Man&quot; in the mid-1990s. He played The Wizard in a stage production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; with Eartha Kitt at Madison Square Garden. Kitt was later replaced by Jo Anne Worley.

=== Final years ===
Rooney wrote a memoir titled &quot;Life Is too Short&quot;, published by Villard Books in 1991. A &quot;Library Journal&quot; review said, &quot;From title to the last line, &#x27;I&#x27;ll have a short bier&#x27;, Rooney&#x27;s self-deprecating humor powers this book.&quot; He wrote a novel about a child star, published in 1994, &quot;The Search for Sonny Skies&quot;. On November 10, 2000, he starred in the Disney Channel original movie &quot;Phantom of the Megaplex&quot;.

Despite the millions of dollars that he earned over the years, such as his $65,000-a-week earnings from &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;, Rooney was plagued by financial problems late in life. His longtime gambling habit caused him to &quot;gamble away his fortune again and again&quot;. He declared bankruptcy for the second time in 1996 and described himself as &quot;broke&quot; in 2005. He kept performing on stage and in the movies, but his personal property was valued at only $18,000 when he died in 2014.

Rooney and his wife Jan toured the country in 2005 through 2011 in a musical revue called &quot;Let&#x27;s Put on a Show&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called it &quot;a homespun affair full of dog-eared jokes&quot; that featured Rooney singing George Gershwin songs.

In 2006, Rooney played Gus in &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;. He returned to play the role again in the sequel &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; in 2009, in a scene that was deleted from the final film.

On May 26, 2007, Rooney was grand marshal at the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival. He made his British pantomime debut, playing Baron Hardup in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, at the Sunderland Empire Theatre over the 2007 Christmas period, a role he reprised at Bristol Hippodrome in 2008 and at the Milton Keynes theater in 2009.

In 2011, Rooney made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Muppets&quot;, and in 2014, at age 93, six weeks before his death, he reprised his role as Gus in &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot;, which was dedicated to Robin Williams, who also died that year, and to him. Although reliant on a wheelchair, he was described by director Shawn Levy as &quot;energetic and so pleased to be there. He was just happy to be invited to the party.&quot;

An October 2015 article in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; maintained that Rooney was frequently abused and financially depleted by his closest relatives in the last years of his life. The article said that it was clear that &quot;one of the biggest stars of all time, who remained aloft longer than anyone in Hollywood history, was in the end brought down by those closest to him. He died humiliated and betrayed, nearly broke, and often broken.&quot;

== Personal life ==

At the time of his death (April 6, 2014), Rooney was married to his eighth wife, Jan Chamberlin Rooney, although they had separated in June 2012. He had 9 children and 2 stepchildren, as well as 19 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Rooney had bipolar disorder and had attempted suicide two or three times over the years, with resulting hospitalizations reported as &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot;. He also had been addicted to sleeping pills, and overcame the addiction in 2000 when he was in his late 70s. In February 1997, he was arrested on suspicion of beating his wife, Jan, but the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

In the late 1970s, Rooney became a born-again Christian and was a fan of Pat Robertson.
On February 16, 2011, Rooney was granted a temporary restraining order against his stepson Christopher Aber and Aber&#x27;s wife Christina, and they were ordered to stay 100 yards from Rooney, his stepson Mark Rooney, and Mark&#x27;s wife Charlene. Rooney claimed that he was a victim of elder abuse. On March 2, 2011, Rooney appeared before a special U.S. Senate committee that was considering legislation to curb elder abuse, testifying about the abuse he claimed to have suffered at the hands of family members. In 2011, all of Rooney&#x27;s finances were permanently handed over to a conservator, who called Rooney &quot;completely competent&quot;.

In April 2011, the temporary restraining order that Rooney was previously granted was replaced by a confidential settlement between Rooney and Aber. Aber and Jan Rooney denied all the allegations.

In May 2013, Rooney sold his home of many years, reportedly for $1.3 million, and split the proceeds with his wife, Jan.

=== Marriages ===
Rooney was married eight times, with six of the unions ending in divorce; his eighth and final marriage lasted longer than the previous seven put together. During the 1960s and 1970s he was often the subject of comedians&#x27; jokes over his apparent inability to stay married. In 1942, he married his first wife, actress Ava Gardner, who at that time was still an obscure teenaged starlet. They divorced the following year, partly because of his alleged infidelity. While stationed in the military in Alabama in 1944, Rooney met and married Betty Jane Phillips, who later became a singer under the name B. J. Baker. They had two sons together. This marriage ended in divorce after he returned from Europe at the end of World War II. His marriage to actress Martha Vickers in 1949 produced one son, but ended in divorce in 1951. He married actress Elaine Mahnken in 1952, and they divorced in 1958.

In 1958, Rooney married model and actress Barbara Ann Thomason (stage name Carolyn Mitchell), they had four children. She was murdered in 1966 by stuntman and actor Milos Milos (at the time bodyguard for French actor Alain Delon) who then shot himself. Thomason and Milos had an affair while Rooney was traveling, and police theorized that Milos had shot her after she wanted to end it. Rooney then married Barbara&#x27;s best friend, Marge Lane, though the marriage lasted only 100 days. He was married to Carolyn Hockett from 1969 to 1975, they had two children. In 1978, he married his eighth and final wife, Jan Chamberlin. Their marriage lasted until his death, a total of 34 years (longer than his seven previous unions combined). However, they separated in 2012.

=== Death ===

Rooney died of natural causes (including complications from diabetes) in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, on April 6, 2014, at the age of 93. A group of family members and friends, including Mickey Rourke, held a memorial service on April 18. A private funeral, organized by another set of family members, was held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where he was interred, on April 19. His eight surviving children said in a statement that they were barred from seeing Rooney during his final years.

At his death, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called Rooney &quot;the original Hollywood train wreck&quot;. Despite earning millions during his career, he had to file for bankruptcy in 1962 due to mismanagement of his finances. In his later years, Rooney had entrusted his finances to his stepson, who funneled Rooney&#x27;s earnings to pay for his own lavish lifestyle. His millions in earnings had dwindled to an estate that was valued at only $18,000. He died owing medical bills and back taxes, and contributions were solicited from the public.

== Legacy ==

Rooney was one of the last surviving actors of the silent-film era. His film career spanned 88 years, from 1926 to 2014, continuing until shortly before his death. During his peak years from the late 1930s to the early 1940s, Rooney was among the top box-office stars in the United States, and in 1939 was &quot;the&quot; biggest box-office draw, followed immediately by Tyrone Power.

He made 43 films between the ages of 15 and 25. Among those, his role as Andy Hardy became one of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s best-loved characters,&quot; with Marlon Brando calling him &quot;the best actor in films&quot;.

&quot;There was nothing he couldn&#x27;t do,&quot; said actress Margaret O&#x27;Brien. MGM boss Louis B. Mayer treated him like a son and saw in Rooney &quot;the embodiment of the amiable American boy who stands for family, humbug, and sentiment,&quot; wrote critic and author David Thomson.

By the time Rooney was 20, his consistent portrayals of characters with youth and energy suggested that his future success was unlimited. Thomson also explains that Rooney&#x27;s characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where &quot;Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:&quot;

By the end of the 1940s, Rooney was no longer in demand, and his career declined. &quot;In 1938,&quot; he said, &quot;I starred in eight pictures. In 1948 and 1949 together, I starred in only three.&quot; Film historian Jeanine Basinger observed while his career &quot;reached the heights and plunged to the depths, Rooney kept on working and growing, the mark of a professional.&quot; Some of the films that reinvigorated his profile were &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962), &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;, and &quot;found himself once more back on top&quot;.

Basinger tries to encapsulate Rooney&#x27;s career:

<doc id="87626" wikidata="Q7788" url="?curid=87626" title="Khabarovsk Krai">
<text>Khabarovsk Krai (, ) is a federal subject (a krai) of Russia. It is located in the Russian Far East and is administratively part of the Far Eastern Federal District. The administrative centre of the krai is the city of Khabarovsk, which is home to roughly half of the krai&#x27;s population and the largest city in the Russian Far East (just ahead of Vladivostok). Khabarovsk Krai is the fourth-largest federal subject by area, and had a population of 1,343,869 as of 2010.

Being dominated by the Siberian High winter cold, the continental climates of the krai see extreme freezing for an area adjacent to the sea near the mid-latitudes, but also warm summers in the interior. The southern region lies mostly in the basin of the lower Amur River, with the mouth of the river located at Nikolaevsk-on-Amur draining into the Strait of Tartary, which separates Khabarovsk Krai from the island of Sakhalin. The north occupies a vast mountainous area along the coastline of the Sea of Okhotsk, a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. Khabarovsk Krai is bordered by Magadan Oblast to the north; Amur Oblast, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, and the Sakha Republic to the west; Primorsky Krai to the south; and Sakhalin Oblast to the east.

The population consists of mostly ethnic Russians, but indigenous people of the area are numerous, such as the Tungusic peoples (Evenks, Negidals, Ulchs, Nanai, Oroch, Udege), Amur Nivkhs, and Ainu.

==Geography==
Khabarovsk Krai shares its borders with Magadan Oblast in the north; with the Sakha Republic and Amur Oblast in the west; with the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, China (Heilongjiang), and Primorsky Krai in the south; and is limited by the Sea of Okhotsk in the east. In terms of area, it is the fourth-largest federal subject within Russia. Major islands include the Shantar Islands.

Taiga and tundra in the north, swampy forest in the central depression, and deciduous forest in the south are the natural vegetation in the area. The main rivers are the Amur, Amgun, Uda, and Tugur, among others. There are also lakes such as Bokon, Bolon, Chukchagir, Evoron, Kizi, Khummi, Orel, and Udyl, among others.

Khabarovsk Krai has a severely continental climate with its northern areas being subarctic with stronger maritime summer moderation in the north. In its southerly areas, especially inland, annual swings are extremely strong, with Khabarovsk itself having hot, wet, and humid summers which rapidly transform into severely cold and long winters, where temperatures hardly ever go above freezing. This is because of the influence of the East Asian monsoon in summer and the bitterly cold Siberian High in winter. The second-largest city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur has even more violent temperature swings than Khabarovsk, with winter average lows below , but in spite of this, avoiding being subarctic because of the significant heat in summer.

The main mountain ranges in the region are the Bureya Range, the Badzhal Range (highest point high, the Gora Ulun), the Yam-Alin, the Dusse-Alin, the Sikhote-Alin, the Dzhugdzhur Mountains, the Kondyor Massif, as well as a small section of the Suntar-Khayata Range, the Yudoma-Maya Highlands, and the Sette-Daban in the western border regions. The highest point is high, Berill Mountain.

There are a number of peninsulas along the krai&#x27;s extensive coast, the main ones being (north to south) the Lisyansky Peninsula, Nurki Peninsula, Tugurskiy Peninsula, and the Tokhareu Peninsula.

The main islands of Khabarovsk Krai (north to south) are Malminskiye Island, the Shantar Islands, Menshikov Island, Reyneke Island (Sea of Okhotsk), Chkalov Island, Baydukov Island, and the Chastye Islands. The island of Sakhalin (Russia&#x27;s largest) is administered separately as Sakhalin Oblast, along with the Kuril Islands.

The charts below detail climate averages from various locations in the krai. Khabarovsk is set near the Chinese border at a lower latitude far inland, while Komsomolsk-on-Amur being further downstream on the Amur river at a higher latitude. Sovetskaya Gavan and Okhotsk are coastal settlements in the deep south and far north, respectively.



==History==
According to various Chinese and Korean records, the southern part of Khabarovsk Krai was originally occupied by one of the five semi-nomadic Shiwei, the Bo Shiwei tribes, and the Black Water Mohe tribes living, respectively, on the west and the east of the Bureya and the Lesser Khingan ranges.

In 1643, Vassili Poyarkov&#x27;s boats descended the Amur, returning to Yakutsk by the Sea of Okhotsk and the Aldan River, and in 1649–1650, Yerofey Khabarov occupied the banks of the Amur. The resistance of the Chinese, however, obliged the Cossacks to quit their forts, and by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), Russia abandoned its advance into the basin of the river.

Although the Russians were thus deprived of the right to navigate the Amur River, the territorial claim over the lower courses of the river was not settled in the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689. The area between the Uda River and the Greater Khingan mountain range (i.e. most of Lower Amuria) was left undemarcated and the Sino-Russian border was allowed to fluctuate.

Later in the nineteenth century, Nikolay Muravyov conducted an aggressive policy with China by claiming that the lower reaches of the Amur River belonged to Russia. In 1852, a Russian military expedition under Muravyov explored the Amur, and by 1857, a chain of Russian Cossacks and peasants had been settled along the whole course of the river. In 1858, in the Treaty of Aigun, China recognized the Amur River downstream as far as the Ussuri River as the boundary between Russia and the Qing Empire, and granted Russia free access to the Pacific Ocean. The Sino-Russian border was later further delineated in the Treaty of Peking of 1860 when the Ussuri Territory (the Maritime Territory), which was previously a joint possession, became Russian.

Khabarovsk Krai was established on 20 October 1938, when the Far Eastern Krai was split into the Khabarovsk and Primorsky Krais. Kamchatka Oblast, which was originally subordinated to the Far Eastern Krai, fell under the Jurisdiction of Khabarovsk Krai, along with its two National Okrugs, Chukotka and Koryak. In 1947, the northern part of Sakhalin was removed from the Krai to join the southern part and form Sakhalin Oblast. In 1948, parts of its southwestern territories were removed from the Krai to form Amur Oblast. In 1953, Magadan Oblast was established from the northern parts of the Krai and was given jurisdiction over Chukotka National Okrug, which was originally under the jurisdiction of Kamchatka oblast. In 1956, Kamchatka Oblast became its own region and took Koryak National Okrug with it. The Krai took its modern form in 1991, just before the USSR&#x27;s collapse when the Jewish Autonomous Oblast was separated from its jurisdiction and made into a direct federal subject of Russia. On 24 April 1996, Khabarovsk signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 12 August 2002.

==Administrative divisions==
==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Khabarovsk CPSU Committee (who, in reality, had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Khabarovsk Krai is the fundamental law of the krai. The Legislative Duma of Khabarovsk Krai is the regional standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Duma exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Krai Government, which includes territorial executive bodies, such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Krai Administration supports the activities of the Governor, who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

On 9 July 2020, the governor of the region, Sergei Furgal, was arrested and flown to Moscow. The 2020 Khabarovsk Krai protests began on 11 July 2020, in support of Furgal.

==Economy==

Khabarovsk Krai is the most industrialized territory of the Far East of Russia, producing 30% of the total industrial products in the Far Eastern Economic Region.

===Heavy industry===
The machine construction industry consists primarily of a highly developed military–industrial complex of large-scale aircraft- and shipbuilding enterprises. The Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association is currently among the krai&#x27;s most successful enterprises, and for years has been the largest taxpayer of the territory. Other major industries include timber-working and fishing, along with metallurgy in the main cities. Komsomolsk-on-Amur is the iron and steel centre of the Far East; a pipeline from northern Sakhalin supplies the petroleum-refining industry in the city of Khabarovsk. In the Amur basin, there is also some cultivation of wheat and soybeans. The administrative centre, Khabarovsk, is at the junction of the Amur River and the Trans-Siberian Railway.

===Mining===
The region&#x27;s mineral resources are relatively underdeveloped. Khabarovsk Krai contains large gold mining operations (Highland Gold, Polus Gold), a major but low-grade copper deposit being explored by IG Integro Group, and a world-class tin district which was a major contributor to the Soviet industrial complex and is currently being revitalised by Far Eastern Tin (Festivalnoye mine) and by , which is developing the Sable Tin Deposit (Sobolinoye), a large high-grade deposit, 25 km from Solnechny town.

<doc id="87627" wikidata="Q6886" url="?curid=87627" title="Amur Oblast">
<text>Amur Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), located on the banks of the Amur and Zeya rivers in the Russian Far East. The oblast borders Heilongjiang province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to the south.

The administrative center of the oblast, the city of Blagoveshchensk, is one of the oldest settlements in the far east of the country, founded in 1856. It is a traditional center of trade and gold mining. The territory is accessed by two railways: the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal–Amur Mainline. As of the 2021 Census, the oblast&#x27;s population was 766,912.

==Names==
&quot;Amur Krai&quot; () or &quot;Priamurye&quot; ( &#x27;Circum-Amur&#x27;) were unofficial names for the Russian territories by the Amur River used in the late Russian Empire that approximately correspond to modern Amur Oblast.

==Geography==
Amur Oblast is located in the southeast of Russia, between Stanovoy Range in the north and the Amur River in the south, and borders with the Sakha Republic in the north, Khabarovsk Krai and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the east, Heilongjiang of China in the south, and with Zabaykalsky Krai in the west. The Stanovoy Range forms the dividing line between the Sakha Republic and Amur Oblast and spreads across the oblast&#x27;s entire northern border. The Amur–Zeya and Zeya–Bureya Plains cover about 40% of the oblast&#x27;s territory, but the rest is hilly. Several mountain ranges rise to the south of Stanovoy Range, including the Selemdzha Range parallel to it, as well as the Ezop, Yam-Alin and the Turan ranges stretching along the oblast&#x27;s southeastern border with Khabarovsk Krai.

Many rivers flow through the oblast, especially in the north, accounting for 75% of the hydropower resources in the Russian Far East. Most of the oblast is in the Amur&#x27;s drainage basin, although the rivers in the northwest drain into the Lena and the rivers in the northeast drain into the Uda. The longest rivers include the Amur, Bureya, Gilyuy, Nyukzha, Olyokma, Selemdzha, and Zeya. The Zeya begins in the mountains in the northeast, and its middle reaches are dammed to create the huge Zeya Reservoir, which sprawls over .

Climate is temperate continental, with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers. Average January temperatures vary from in the south to in the north. Average July temperatures are in the south and in the north. Annual precipitation is about .

Dwarf Siberian pine and alpine tundra grow at higher elevations and larch forests with small stands of flat-leaved birch and pine forests grow alongside the river plains. These larch and fir-spruce forests form the watershed of the Selemdzha River. The Bureya and Arkhara Rivers, southeast of the Selemdza, have the richest remaining forests in the oblast with Korean pine, Schisandra chinensis, Mongolian Oak, and other Manchurian flora. The Zeya–Bureya Plain, located between the Zeya, Amur, and Bureya Rivers, has the highest biodiversity in Amur Oblast. Much of this plain has been burned for agriculture, but large patches still remain. Japanese Daurian and Far Eastern western cranes nest here, as well as a host of other rare birds.

===Natural resources===
Amur Oblast has considerable reserves of many types of mineral resources; proven reserves are estimated to be worth US$400 billion. Among the most important are gold (the largest reserves in Russia), silver, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, and tin. There are also an estimated 70 billion tons of bituminous coal and lignite reserves. Probable iron deposits are estimated to be 3.8 billion tons. The Garin deposit is fully explored and known to contain 389 million tons of iron ore. Estimated reserves of the deposit are 1,293 million tons. The deposit&#x27;s ore contains a low concentration of detrimental impurities; the ore contains 69.9% iron. Amur Oblast is also a promising source of titanium, with the Bolshoy Seyim deposit being the most important.

==History==
===Early history===
According to the &quot;Bei Shi&quot; (Dynastic History of Northern Dynasties) and the &quot;Sui Shu&quot; (Chronicles of the Sui dynasty), both Chinese records, this area belonged originally to the territory one of the five semi-nomadic Shiwei, the Bo Shiwei tribes (). Their settlements were located on the north of the Yilehuli Mountains in the upper reaches of the Nen River, south of the Stanovoy Range, west of the Bureya and the Malyi Khingan ranges and reaching the Okhotsk Sea on the northeast. They brought tributary presents to the Tang court and disappeared at the dawn of the tenth century with the foundation of the Liao empire.

Later, in the 13th century, the middle-Amur and the Zeya River basin area became the homeland of the Daurs and (further south) the Duchers. The ancestors of the Daurs are thought to be closely related to the Khitans and the Mongols, while the Duchers may have been a branch of the Jurchen people, later known as the Manchus.

The area was conquered by the Manchus in 1639–1640, after defeating the Evenk Federation led by Bombogor. It was returned to the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk with the Tsardom of Russia.

===Russian Empire===
The region was annexed by Russia in 1858 in the Treaty of Aigun between Russia and the Qing dynasty. Amur Oblast was established with its center in Blagoveshchensk.

The region received its first influx of Russian settlers in the mid-seventeenth century. They were looking for a more temperate climate as an escape from the north. After the Opium War, when the Chinese Empire was exposed to the outside world, Russian explorers once again moved to the region (mostly Cossacks and peasant farmers). The last influx of people arrived upon the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.

===Modern history===
In April 1920, the Far Eastern Republic, with its capital in Chita, was formed from Amur, Transbaikal, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Primorye regions as a democratic &quot;buffer&quot; state in order to avoid war with Japan. It existed until November 1922, when it joined the Russian SFSR.

In January 1926, the territory of Amur Oblast was split between the East Siberian Krai and the Far Eastern Krai. The East Siberian Oblast was divided into Irkutsk Oblast and Chita Oblast in 1937 and the part of Amur within it became part of Chita Oblast. The Far Eastern Krai was divided into Khabarovsk Krai and Primorye Krai in 1938. The territory of Amur Oblast that was in Far Eastern Krai was included in Khabarovsk Krai.

In 1948, Amur Oblast was finally separated from Khabarovsk Krai and Chita Oblast to become an independent region of the RSFSR. Rapid economic growth based on gold production began at that time, and living standards improved with the arrival of young specialists. As the Far Eastern District expanded, the demand for services such as electric power and housing also increased, which stimulated a new round of construction projects. New cities were built, along with the Zeya Hydroelectric Power Plant (Zeiskaya GES), which still supplies electricity to most of the Far Eastern District. On 21 May 1998 Amur alongside Ivanovo, Kostroma, Voronezh Oblast, and the Mari El Republic signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 18 March 2002.

==Administrative divisions==
The largest urban localities of the oblast are Blagoveshchensk, Belogorsk, Svobodny, Tynda, and Raychikhinsk.

==Politics==
The Governor of Amur Oblast since 2018 is Vasily Orlov.

On 19 September 2021, elections to the Legislative Assembly of Amur Oblast were held. One self-nominee and seven parties entered the regional parliament: United Russia - 18 seats; the Communist Party of the Russian Federation - 3 seats; the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, A Just Russia – For Truth, the Party of Pensioners, New People, and Communists of Russia - one each place.

The Chairman of the Legislative Assembly is Konstantin Dyakonov.

===Agriculture===
The Amur Region is the primary producer of soybean in Russia. By 1940, 65 thousand hectares of land in Amur had been cultivated with soybeans, and by 1972 soybean made up 592 thousand hectares of land in Amur, compared to 650 thousand hectares of soybean crops in the whole of the USSR. During the Soviet period, this made up a significant proportion of the economy of Far Eastern Russia. By 2019, the Amur Region&#x27;s share of Russian soybean production had declined to 28 percent due to increased cultivation of soybean in other regions, though it still remains Russia&#x27;s largest soybean producer. The region in 2019 produced approximately 1 million tonnes of soybean, many of which are exported to neighboring China. While in the past the harvested soybean was shipped west, in recent years due to increased Chinese demands multiple soybean oil plants have opened in the region. In 2019, Chinese companies owned or leased some 100 thousand hectares out of the 1.3 million hectares of farmland.

<doc id="87628" wikidata="Q1698640" url="?curid=87628" title="Yawara">
<text>The yawara is a Japanese weapon used in various martial arts. Numerous types of jujutsu make use of a small rod, made of wood, that extends somewhat from both ends of a person&#x27;s fist which is known as a &quot;yawara&quot;. The &quot;yawara&quot; likely originated from the use of the tokkosho, a Buddhist symbolic object, by monks in feudal Japan. The tokkosho was used during the Edo period and it was made of brass. Sometimes a short rope or cord would be looped around the user&#x27;s wrist to distract someone else while in combat. The methods of using a &quot;yawara&quot; may have been created by samurai that used tantojutsu, which was combat that made use of a short knife. According to another theory, a samurai might have fought with the scabbard &quot;when a more deadly weapon was not necessary&quot;.

The &quot;yawara&quot; stick was popularized for police officers in the 1940s by Frank A. Matsuyama, who made his own version in 1937 or earlier. The upgraded &quot;yawara&quot; was made of Bakelite plastic and had golf shoe metal spikes on both ends. A &quot;yawara&quot; can be used by the general public for self-defense in some countries. A variation of the &quot;yawara&quot; is a kubotan which is about six inches long, made of plastic, weighs about two ounces, and has no sharp edges. The kubotan is used by police officers and the general public. It is considered to be a modern version of a &quot;yawara&quot;, which is &quot;a little shorter and broader&quot;. In the United States, &quot;yawaras&quot; are not intrinsically illegal in any jurisdiction. In the UK it&#x27;s illegal for any member of the public to carry a lethal or non-lethal self defence weapon. 

==History==
Numerous types of jujutsu make use of a small rod, made of wood, that extends somewhat from both ends of a person&#x27;s fist which is known as a &quot;yawara&quot;. The shaft of a &quot;yawara&quot; is often &quot;carved to fit a user&#x27;s fingers and to improve grip&quot;. The &quot;yawara&quot; is around long. Either end of the &quot;yawara&quot; can &quot;be used to strike or apply pressure to sensitive vital points on an opponent&#x27;s body&quot;. Pressure points that can be easily struck with a &quot;yawara&quot; are &quot;the forehead, bridge of nose, upper lip, chin, temple, jaw, bicep, solar plexus, elbow, forearm, kidney, wrist, hypocondrium, genitalia, testicles, and knee&quot;. When a &quot;yawara&quot; is &quot;held across the palm&quot;, it can &quot;be used to block strikes of blows, even knife and sword slashes&quot;. Sometimes a wielder would add a short &quot;rope or cord&quot; that would be looped around the user&#x27;s wrist, allowing the &quot;yawara&quot; to be propelled as a distraction while in combat. With the cord setup, the user can easily retrieve the &quot;yawara&quot; and the cord itself can be used to capture the other person&#x27;s &quot;limb or weapon as well as to restrain an attacker after they had been subdued&quot;. The cord or hook were sometimes called &quot;torihimo&quot; or &quot;bird rope&quot;.

It is believed by some historians that methods of using a &quot;yawara&quot; were created by samurai that used tantojutsu, which was combat with a short knife. A theory states that the scabbard of a short blade may have swelled from water, resulting in it being hard for a samurai to &quot;draw the blade&quot; from its scabbard. When that happened, the samurai started using the scabbard as a weapon. According to another theory, a samurai might have fought with the scabbard &quot;when a more deadly weapon was not necessary&quot;. It is likely that the &quot;yawara&quot; was based on the tokkosho which was used by Buddhist priests, monks, and pilgrims for incantations and prayers. A tokkosho symbolized the Buddha&#x27;s ability to destroy evil, but it could also be used in self-defense &quot;as a hand-held weapon&quot;. A takkosho was used during the Edo period and it was made of brass. It was an object that was used in rituals.

Due to metal being expensive and requiring forging by tools, wood (of any type) was used to create a &quot;yawara&quot;. Because it is easy to carve and use a &quot;yawara&quot;, it has been used as part of multiple self-defense styles in the western world. In feudal Japan, some &quot;yawara&quot; included miniature claws on one end, allowing someone to &quot;hook the opponent&#x27;s clothing to pull the attacker off-balance and throw him&quot;. The claws could also be used to attack an opponent&#x27;s face.

===Police use===
Assistants of the Japanese police force created various ways to capture a criminal with the rope of the &quot;yawara&quot;. Japanese immigrant Frank Matsuyama taught the Berkeley, California, police department how to use the &quot;yawara&quot; in the 1930s. Matsuyama later wrote the book &quot;How to Use the Yawara Stick for Police&quot;, which details the use of an upgraded &quot;yawara&quot; that he created in 1937 or earlier for police officers. The upgraded &quot;yawara&quot; was made of Bakelite plastic and had golf shoe spikes on both ends. The spikes, which were made of metal, were to dishearten someone from taking the &quot;yawara&quot; from the police officer or to cause pain in order to stop a criminal. Matsuyama stated in his book of his upgrade of the &quot;yawara&quot;, &quot;The &quot;Yawara&quot; stick is very effective, easy to carry, easy to learn how to use, and easy to remember. It is hard – in fact, almost impossible – for anyone to wrest it from an Officer&#x27;s grasp. The &quot;Yawara&quot; stick is better appearing, very inconspicuous, and is not objectionable to the public – even when it is being used&quot;. While some &quot;yawara&quot; have ball bearings on each end, that version has been banned for most police officer usage due to how easily it can penetrate both flesh and bone. A 1985 manual by the University of Illinois titled &quot;Police Yawara Stick Techniques, Second Edition&quot; details &quot;the advantages and disadvantages of the &quot;yawara&quot; stick as a weapon&quot;. The manual states how police officers can effectively use the &quot;yawara&quot; and it includes illustrations for each method of use.

===General public use===
The &quot;yawara&quot; has also been created by using hard nylon and aircraft-grade aluminum for use by the general public. Depending on the company, the &quot;yawara&quot; can be built as either hollow or solid. For self-defense, the &quot;yawara&quot; can be aimed at the neck, throat, temple, eyes, or nose. A &quot;yawabara&quot; is easy to hide and might also have an attachment for a keychain. For use by the general public, a &quot;yawabara&quot; is inexpensive. Martial artist Miguel Ibarra stated of a &quot;yawara&quot;, &quot;It can give a person who might lack physical size, strength or highly developed technique an edge against an attacker&quot;. Martial artist Roy Goldberg said, &quot;Stay away from the types of &quot;yawara&quot; that have knives or blades concealed inside them. If you practice right, you be very effective with the plain stick; you don&#x27;t need the blade.&quot; Goldberg also said that &quot;there is more risk of being prosecuted for carrying a concealed weapon if you have a &quot;yawara&quot; with a blade inside&quot;. The senior black belt demonstration division of the American Jujitsu Association can demonstrate how to use a &quot;yawara&quot; among other weapons.

A variation of the &quot;yawara&quot; is a kubotan which is &quot;about six inches long, made of plastic, weighs about two ounces, and has no sharp edges. The kubotan is used by police officers and the general public. It is considered to be a modern version of a &quot;yawara&quot;, which is &quot;a little shorter and broader&quot;.

==Etymology==
The kanji for &quot;yawara&quot; and ju in jujutsu or judo is the same (柔). The kanji also translates to &quot;flexibility&quot; or &quot;giving way&quot;. Another term for &quot;yawara&quot; is &quot;tenouchi&quot; which translates to &quot;inside the hand&quot;.

==Legality==
In the United States, &quot;yawaras&quot; are not intrinsically illegal in any jurisdiction.

<doc id="87633" wikidata="Q119770" url="?curid=87633" title="Nose picking">
<text>Nose picking is the act of extracting mucus and nasal mucus with one&#x27;s finger (rhinotillexis) and may include the subsequent ingestion of the extracted mucus (mucophagy). 
In Western cultures, this act is generally considered to be socially deviant; parents and pediatricians have historically tried to prevent development of the habit and attempt to break it if already established.

==Prevalence==
Nose picking is an extremely widespread habit: some surveys indicate that it is almost universal, with people picking their nose on average about four times a day. A 1995 study of nose picking, requesting information from 1,000 randomly selected adults from Wisconsin USA gathered 254 responses. It defined nose picking as &quot;the insertion of a finger (or other object) into the nose with the intention of removing dried nasal secretions&quot;. Of those who responded, 91% said they were current nose pickers (but only 75% of these believed everyone did it), and two respondents claimed to spend between 15 and 30 minutes and between one and two hours a day picking their noses.

Mucous membranes in the nasal cavity constantly produce a wet mucus that removes dust and pathogens from the air flowing through the cavity. For the most part, the cilia that also line the cavity work to move the mucus toward the throat, where it can be swallowed. However, not all the mucus stays fluid enough to be moved by the cilia. The closer the mucus is to the nostril opening, the more moisture it loses to the outside air, and the more likely it is to dry out and become stuck. Once dried, the mucus typically causes a sensation of irritation that leads to the compulsion to dislodge the itch by picking. Other reasons to remove excess dried mucus include impaired breathing through the nose and a concern that it may be visible to others in the nostril openings.

In some cultures, nose picking is considered a private act akin to defecation, urination, flatulence, burping, or masturbation. Mucophagy, which is eating the extracted mucus, may be considered more taboo, and is sometimes portrayed in comedies.

==Rhinotillexomania==
When nose picking becomes a body-focused repetitive behavior or obsessive–compulsive disorder it is known as rhinotillexomania. Most cases do not meet this pathological threshold. When it does, however, treatments similar to other BFRBs can be employed, such as habit reversal training and decoupling.

==Medical risks and benefits==
The environment of the nose and the dried secretions removed contain many micro-organisms. When a person is contagious with a cold, flu or other virus, it is important that hands or other objects used to remove mucus are washed promptly because there is risk of introducing micro-organisms to other parts of the body or other people since it is a norm to shake hands in many societies.

Picking one&#x27;s nose with dirty fingers or fingernails may increase risks of infection that may include an increase in the diversity of nose flora (and thus infection or illness), or occasional nosebleeds. One case of rhinotillexomania resulted in perforation of the nasal septum and self-induced ethmoidectomy. In children, the most common complication related to nose picking is epistaxis (nosebleed). Infections or perforation of the nasal septum are uncommon, but can occur. Nose picking, however, should not affect the sense of smell, as the nasal cavity where the olfactory nerves are located is too high up to reach.

Researchers at Griffith University have discovered a connection between bacteria and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. They have found evidence that a specific bacterium (Chlamydia pneumoniae) is capable of traveling through the olfactory nerve in the nose and entering the brain of mice. The intrusion of the bacteria is enhanced by nose picking. Once inside the brain, this bacterium triggers the production of certain markers that are indicative of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Their study demonstrates that Chlamydia pneumoniae exploits the nerve pathway that extends from the nasal cavity to the brain as a means to invade the central nervous system. In response to this invasion, brain cells deposit a protein called amyloid beta, which is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Activities like picking one&#x27;s nose or plucking nasal hairs can damage the nasal lining, making it easier for bacteria to reach the brain. The olfactory nerve, located in the nose, provides a direct and relatively short route to the brain. Importantly, this route bypasses the protective barrier known as the blood-brain barrier. It seems that viruses and bacteria have identified this pathway as an easy way to gain access to the brain. Therefore, it is according to Professor St John, a co-author of the study, advisable to avoid nose picking or plucking nasal hairs to maintain the integrity of the nasal passage and lower the chances of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. However, there is still scarce evidence in favour of this claim, and most experts say it is too soon to link.

Some scientists claim that mucophagy provides benefits for the human body. Friedrich Bischinger, an Austrian doctor specializing in lungs, advocates using fingers to pick nasal mucus and then ingesting it, stating that people who do so get &quot;a natural boost to their immune system&quot;. The mucus contains a &quot;cocktail of antiseptic enzymes that kill or weaken many of the bacteria that become entangled in it&quot;, so reintroducing the &quot;crippled&quot; microorganisms &quot;may afford the immune system an opportunity to produce antibodies in relative safety&quot;. However, other scientists argue that, &quot;because boogers are made from the same ingredients as the mucus we swallow every day, ... eating boogers doesn’t matter much to your immune system&quot;.

A study in the Netherlands published in 2023 found that healthcare workers who picked their nose were about three times more likely to contract COVID-19. The same study found no correlation between COVID infection and nail-biting, or with wearing spectacles or having a beard, which could interfere with fit of protective equipment. The study was observational, finding a correlation without identifying a detailed cause.

<text>Daisy wheel printing is an impact printing technology invented in 1970 by Andrew Gabor at Diablo Data Systems. It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements, each with typically 96 glyphs, to generate high-quality output comparable to premium typewriters such as the IBM Selectric, but two to three times faster. Daisy wheel printing was used in electronic typewriters, word processors and computers from 1972. The daisy wheel is so named because of its resemblance to the daisy flower.

By 1980 daisy wheel printers had become the dominant technology for high-quality text printing, grossly impacting the dominance of manual and electric typewriters, and forcing dominant companies in that industry, including Brother and Silver Seiko to rapidly adapt — and new companies, e.g., Canon and Xerox, to enter the personal and office market for daisy wheel typewriters. The personal and office printing industry would soon adapt again to the advent of the PC and word processing software. 

Dot-matrix impact, thermal, or line printers were used where higher speed or image printing were required and where their print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers, in particular laser and ink jet printers, capable of printing any characters, graphics, typefaces or fonts, rather than a limited, 96 character set, gradually were able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy wheel technology is now mostly defunct, though is still found in electronic typewriters.

== History ==
In 1889 Arthur Irving Jacobs patented a daisy wheel design that was used on the Victor index typewriter.

A. H. Reiber of Teletype Corporation received in 1939 for a daisy wheel printer.

In 1970 a team at Diablo Systems led by engineer Dr Andrew Gabor developed the first commercially successful daisy wheel printer, a device that was faster and more flexible than IBM&#x27;s Selectric devices, being capable of 30 cps (characters per second), whereas the Selectric operated at 13.4 cps. Andrew Gabor was issued two patents for the invention and. 

Xerox acquired Diablo that same year. Xerox&#x27;s Office Product Division had already been buying Diablo printers for its Redactron text editors. After 7 years trying to make Diablo profitable, the OPD focused on developing and selling the Diablo 630 which was mostly bought by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation. The Diablo 630 could produce letter quality output as good as that produced by an IBM Selectric or Selectric-based printer, but at lower cost and double the speed. A further advantage was that it supported the entire ASCII printing character set. Its servo-controlled carriage also permitted the use of proportional spaced fonts, where characters occupy a different amount of horizontal space according to their width.

The Diablo 630 was so successful that virtually all later daisy wheel printers, as well as many dot matrix printers and even the original Apple Laserwriter either copied its command set or could emulate it. Daisy wheel printers from Diablo and Qume were the dominant high-end output technology for computer and office automation applications by 1980, though high speed non-impact techniques were already entering the market (e.g. IBM 6640 inkjet, Xerox 2700 and IBM 6670 laser). From 1981 onwards the IBM PC&#x27;s introduction of &quot;Code page 437&quot; with 254 printable glyphs (including 40 shapes specifically for drawing forms), and development of Xerox Star-influenced environments such as the Macintosh, GEM and Windows made bit-mapped approaches more desirable, driving cost reductions for laser printing and higher resolution for impact dot matrix printing.

Xerox later adapted Diablo&#x27;s daisy wheel technology into a typewriter that sold for less than $50. An automated factory was built near Dallas that took less than 30 minutes to assemble a Xerox typewriter. The Xerox typewriter was well received but never achieved the projected sales numbers due to the advent of the PC and word processing software. The typewriter was later modified to be compatible with PCs but the engineering which made it a low cost device reduced its flexibility. By the mid-1980s daisy wheel technology was rapidly becoming obsolete due to the growing spread of affordable laser and inkjet machines, and daisy wheel machines soon disappeared except for the small remaining typewriter market.

== Design ==

The heart of the system is an interchangeable metal or plastic &quot;daisy wheel&quot; holding an entire character set as raised characters moulded on each &quot;petal&quot;. In use a servo motor rotates the daisy wheel to position the required character between the hammer and the ribbon. The solenoid-operated hammer then fires, driving the character type onto the ribbon and paper to print the character on the paper. The daisy wheel and hammer are mounted on a sliding carriage similar to that used by dot matrix printers.

Different typefaces and sizes can be used by replacing the daisy wheel. It is possible to use multiple fonts within a document: font changing is facilitated by printer device drivers which can position the carriage to the center of the platen and prompt the user to change the wheel before continuing printing. However, printing a document with frequent font changes requiring frequent wheel changes quickly became tedious.

Many daisy wheel machines offer a bold type facility, accomplished by double- or triple-striking the specified character(s); servo-based printers advance the carriage fractionally for a wider (and therefore blacker) character, while cheaper machines perform a carriage return without a line feed to return to the beginning of the line, space through all non-bold text, and restrike each bolded character. The inherent imprecision in attempting to restrike on exactly the same spot after a carriage return provides the same effect as the more expensive servo-based printers, with the unique side effect that as the printer ages and wears, bold text becomes bolder.

Like all other impact printers, daisy wheel printers are noisy.

===Bi-directional printing===
Most daisy-wheel printers could print a line and then, using built-in memory, print the following line backwards, from right to left. This saved the time that otherwise would have been needed to return the print head to its starting point. This was sometimes known as &#x27;logic seeking,&#x27; and was a feature on some dot-matrix printers as well.

=== Graphics ===

Although the daisy wheel principle is basically inappropriate for printing bitmap graphics, there were attempts to enable them to do so. Most daisy wheel printers supported a relatively coarse and extremely slow graphics mode by printing the image entirely out of dots (formed by the &quot;period&quot; character). This required a mechanism capable of pixel by pixel movement, both horizontally and vertically, and low-end printers were incapable of it. Given the slow speed and the coarse resolution this was not a feasible technique for printing large images. However, it could usefully print a small logo onto a letterhead and then the following letter, all in a single unattended print run without changing the print element.

Daisy wheel printers are capable of producing simplified graphics in the form of ASCII art.

Consideration was also given to optimising graphic printing by changing the glyphs on the daisy wheel to a set that would be able to print all the required bitmap combinations more quickly, without requiring an impact for every single dot. This would have the advantage that vertical dot combinations could be printed in a single impact, without requiring fine rotation control of the platen roller. However it would require a specialised daisy wheel so printing of a letter and letterhead would require a two-step process with a manual wheel change in-between. As the development of this technique post-dated the widespread availability of 24-pin dot matrix printers and coincided with the arrival of affordable laser printers in offices, it was never a popular approach.

Brother Industries manufactured the Twinriter series printers, which tried to overcome the limitation of the missing graphics capabilities of daisy wheel printers by adding a dot matrix print head to the existing daisy wheel print head, with the former being used for letter quality printing and the latter for drafts and for printing symbols which were not present in the daisy wheel character set.

== Variants ==

Thimble printers are closely related to daisy wheel printers. Instead of a flat wheel, the petals are bent to form a cup-shaped &quot;thimble&quot; print element. Introduced by NEC in 1977 as their &quot;Spinwriter&quot; series, the replaceable thimbles each held 128 characters.

<text>The Third Anglo-Dutch War, began on 27 March 1672, and concluded on 19 February 1674. A naval conflict between the Dutch Republic and England, in alliance with France, it is considered a related conflict of the wider 1672 to 1678 Franco-Dutch War.

In the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, Charles II of England agreed to support an attack by Louis XIV of France on the Dutch Republic. By doing so, Louis hoped to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, while Charles sought to restore the damage to his prestige caused by the 1667 Raid on the Medway. Under the treaty, Charles also received secret payments which he hoped would make him financially independent of Parliament.

The French offensive in May and June 1672 quickly overran most of the Republic, with the exception of the core province of Holland, where they were halted by water defences. In early June, the Anglo-French fleet was badly damaged by the Dutch under Michiel de Ruyter at the Battle of Solebay. Shortly thereafter, Johan de Witt resigned as Grand Pensionary, and Charles&#x27; nephew William III of Orange was appointed Stadtholder. William rebuffed attempts by Charles to make peace, knowing the French alliance was unpopular in England, while French success brought him support from Emperor Leopold and Spain.

By the end of 1672, the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May, and with hopes of a quick victory gone, Parliament refused to continue funding the war. Between June and July 1673, the Dutch and Anglo-French fleets fought four separate battles, which ended any prospect of an English landing. The English merchant fleet meanwhile suffered heavy losses to Dutch privateers. In addition, Louis now focused on taking the Spanish Netherlands, an objective as harmful to English interests as it was to Dutch. The resulting increase in domestic opposition forced Charles to agree the Second Peace of Westminster in February 1674.

== Background ==
The 1652–1654 First Anglo-Dutch War was the result of commercial rivalry and Orangist support for the exiled Charles II, uncle of William of Orange. Peace terms agreed in 1654 with the English Protectorate included the permanent exclusion of the House of Orange-Nassau from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles regained the English throne in 1660, his Orangist links meant Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with Louis XIV in 1662.

Despite their long-standing support in the Dutch Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain, French objectives in the Low Countries threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 Peace of Münster permanently closed the Scheldt estuary, benefiting De Witt&#x27;s power base of Amsterdam by eliminating their closest rival, Antwerp, and keeping it shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the North Flemish coast allowed a hostile power to blockade the Channel.

In 1665, an attack by the Duke of York on the West-Indische Compagnie led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at Lowestoft, an invasion by Münster and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the States of Holland blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the War of Devolution in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté.

His refusal to recall Parliament forced Charles to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating Raid on the Medway. Despite this triumph, the Dutch were more worried by French gains; they quickly negotiated an end to the war in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them. Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an alliance to Louis, who was unwilling to pay the subsidies demanded; however, De Witt welcomed English envoys to The Hague, seeing it as a way to put pressure on France.

French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the States General, who preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and Sweden signed the Triple Alliance, committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war. Charles disclosed the secret clause to Louis, who felt betrayed by the Dutch. Louis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, although he retained Charleroi and Tournai.

Concluding the Dutch would never voluntarily accept French aims in the Spanish Netherlands, Louis decided the best way to achieve them was to eliminate the Republic. This meant breaking up the Triple Alliance; since the subsidies promised by the Dutch remained unpaid, it was easy to detach Sweden by offering money, making England his next target. The French and English kings negotiated the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, using Henrietta of England as a mediator, Charles&#x27; sister and Louis&#x27; sister in law. Very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions.

Terms included an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a Dutch rump state for his nephew William and a British brigade for the French army. The treaty was signed in December 1670, but omitted secret clauses not revealed until 1677; Louis agreed to pay Charles £230,000 per year for the brigade, £1 million for the navy and £200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, the timing of which was left up to him. Aware Louis was negotiating with De Witt over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded Walcheren, Cadzand and Sluys, whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.

National tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667, and there was minimal support for an anti-Dutch alliance with France. Exchanging the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam for the spice island of Run resolved a major area of dispute, while both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs. Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.

== Preparations ==
Louis instructed de Pomponne, his ambassador in The Hague, to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic while he finalised invasion plans. The English envoy, Sir William Temple, was entrusted by Charles with the same mission. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along their southern border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with Electoral Cologne, allowing his army to advance through the Principality of Liège for an attack from the east (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to Emperor Leopold I not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.

In April 1672, France agreed to subsidise Sweden to remain neutral, while also promising military assistance if &#x27;threatened&#x27; by Brandenburg-Prussia. This offset an agreement of 6 May between the Dutch and Frederick William, whose territories included the Duchy of Cleves on their eastern border. Hoping for English backing, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed Charles&#x27; 22-year-old nephew William as captain-general of the federal army, which had an authorised total of 83,000 men. Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while many garrisons were below strength; on 12 June, one commander reported he had only four companies available from an official total of eighteen.

The Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9 million to 4.8 million guilders. At the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1667, the Dutch Navy was the largest in Europe but by 1672 the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third. However, the French were inexperienced, their ships badly designed and their relationship with the Royal Navy was damaged by mutual suspicion.

In the battles of 1666, the Dutch had been hampered by lack of familiarity with their new, much heavier, warships, the complex federal command system and conflict between Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Tromp. By 1672, these had been corrected, and De Ruyter&#x27;s intensive training of his fleet in line-of-battle manoeuvres installed a new sense of coherence and discipline. Dutch ships were generally better gun platforms, whose shallow draft suited operations close to shore but were slow and less effective in open seas. Although Dutch numbers were further reduced by Friesland retaining ships for defence against Münster, better training and design gave them operational equality.

England provided two-thirds of an Anglo-French fleet of 98 &quot;great ships and frigates&quot;, whose role was to gain control of Dutch waters, land an expeditionary force and attack its shipping. Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of Dumbarton&#x27;s, a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.

Parliament&#x27;s refusal to fund a war against the Protestant Dutch in alliance with Catholic France meant Charles had to find other sources of finance. In January 1672, he suspended repayment of Crown debts, an act that produced £1.3 million, but had disastrous economic effects. Many City of London merchants were ruined and it shut off the short-term financing essential to international trade. In late March, two weeks before a formal declaration of war, he ordered an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort under Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest. 

The unpopularity of the French alliance and lack of funding forced Charles to gamble on a quick war. In an attempt to gain support from Nonconformists, he issued a Royal Declaration of Indulgence on 15 March, but by also removing restrictions on Catholics, it did little to reduce opposition. Hostility increased when Charles appointed his Catholic brother James as Lord High Admiral rather than his Protestant cousin, Prince Rupert. Even the Royal Navy found it difficult to recruit enough sailors to fully man the fleet.

His chief minister, Lord Arlington, was instructed to &quot;break with (the Dutch), yet to lay the breach at their door&quot;. This was done using manufactured incidents, including the &quot;Merlin&quot; affair, which took place near Brill in August 1671. The royal yacht was ordered to sail through the Dutch fleet, who duly struck their flag in salute, but failed to fire white smoke, an honour afforded only to warships. A formal complaint to the States General was dismissed, while few in England were even aware of the incident. Its use as a pretext, combined with the attack on the Dutch convoy, led some English politicians to declare the conflict &quot;unjust&quot;. England declared war on 27 March, followed by France on 6 April.

== The war in 1672 ==
=== Overview ===
When the French invaded the Dutch Republic in May 1672, it initially seemed as if they had won an overwhelming victory. By the end of June, only the Dutch Water Line stood between them and the core province of Holland; by opening the sluices, the Dutch managed to stop the French advance. Dutch survival depended on control of the sea lanes, which ensured they could bring in vital supplies and keep trade routes open. Although outnumbered, on 7 June De Ruyter attacked the combined Anglo-French fleet at the Battle of Solebay; both sides lost one ship each, but it ended significant naval operations for the year.

His unexpected success proved a mixed blessing for Louis, since it distracted from the main objectives of capturing the Spanish Netherlands. The possibility of France controlling the Republic, the largest commercial power in Europe, brought the Dutch support from Emperor Leopold and Spain among others. It also increased opposition in England, where many had opposed an alliance with Catholic France from the start. Peace negotiations made little progress; an over-confident Louis made demands unacceptable even to his English allies, while the Dutch used the opportunity to acquire allies and rebuild their army. By the end of 1672, they had regained much of the territory lost in May; Charles had run out of money and Parliament was unwilling to provide further financing.

=== French success: May to June ===
The speed with which the Republic was over-run in 1672 means it is still referred to as the &quot;Rampjaar&quot; or &#x27;Year of disaster&#x27;. On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Liège; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of Maastricht, crossed the Meuse and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of Rheinberg, Orsoy, Buderich and Wesel. The last of these surrendered on 9 June, while troops from Münster and Cologne simultaneously entered the provinces of Overijssel and Gelderland.

On 12 June, the French crossed the Lower Rhine into the Betuwe near Schenkenschans and, recrossing the Lower Rhine to outflank the IJssel Line, occupied Arnhem on 16 June and Zutphen on 25 June. Now in danger of being cut off from the core province of Holland, William and his troops retreated through Utrecht behind the Holland Water Line; the inundations were released on 22 June, stopping the French advance in this area. On 5 July, Overijssel surrendered to Bernhard von Galen, Prince-Bishop of Münster, who occupied Drenthe; he reached Groningen, but flooding prevented a proper siege and his troops were soon starving.

The States General had responded to the March attack on the Smyrna convoy by expanding the active fleet from forty-eight to sixty vessels and ordering the construction of thirty-six new vessels. This still left them outnumbered by the combined Anglo-French fleet, and De Ruyter withdrew into shoal waters near the Dutch coast, awaiting an opportunity. Disasters on land meant De Witt needed a victory; he ordered De Ruyter to attack, accompanied by Cornelis de Witt to ensure these instructions were carried out.

When the Allied fleet withdrew to Solebay near Southwold, Suffolk, to resupply, on 7 June De Ruyter surprised it at the Battle of Solebay. The Duke of York led his squadrons against the main Dutch fleet, but his French colleague d&#x27;Estrées either misunderstood his intentions or deliberately ignored them, sailing in the opposite direction. The thirty French ships fought a separate encounter at long-range with fifteen ships from the Admiralty of Zeeland, under Adriaen Banckert. D&#x27;Estrées was later condemned by some of his own officers for failing to engage them more closely.

The Earl of Sandwich was killed when the &quot;Royal James&quot; was sunk by fireships, with other ships suffering heavy damage. Although ship losses were roughly equal, Solebay ensured the Dutch retained control of their coastal waters, secured their trade routes and ended hopes of an Anglo-French landing in Zeeland. Anger at the alleged lack of support from D&#x27;Estrées increased opposition to the war, and Parliament was reluctant to approve funds for essential repairs. For the rest of the year, this restricted English naval operations to a failed attack on the Dutch East India Company Return Fleet.

However, this did not offset the damage caused by Dutch defeats on land, and it was impossible to hide the gravity of the crisis. A stream of venomous Orangist pamphlets accused the De Witt brothers in particular and the Regent regime in general of betraying the country to the French. There was widespread rioting, with Orangists seizing control of city councils and demanding William take over government. On 22 June, Johan de Witt was badly wounded in an assassination attempt; one of the attackers, Jacob van der Graaf, was quickly arrested, tried and executed, increasing popular anger with the De Witts.

=== Negotiations ===
The Dutch were helped by the incompatibility of French and English objectives, while initial success meant Louis over-estimated the strength of his position. French expansion in the Spanish Netherlands was primarily intended to grow their economy at the expense of the Dutch, but undermined English trade and security as well. If Louis also gained control of Holland, the financial and commercial centre of Europe, the potential increase in French influence threatened every other European state.

On 14 June, the States of Holland opened negotiations, offering Louis the right to occupy key fortresses in the south, plus an indemnity of ten million guilders. He responded with additional demands including religious freedom for Catholics, or French sovereignty over Utrecht and Guelders. Both sides were using talks as a delaying tactic, assuming their position would improve; Louis knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions. The English were to be ceded Delfzijl, in Groningen, already besieged by Münster.

Arguing only Charles could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to his nephew William&#x27;s appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington and Buckingham to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. They arrived at William&#x27;s headquarters in Nieuwerbrug on 5 July, cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support. The mood quickly changed when their terms were made public. France and Münster were to retain their conquests and William would be appointed Sovereign Prince of Holland, in return for which he would pay England ten million guilders, £10,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow English garrisons to occupy Brill, Sluys and Vlissingen.

William rejected the offer, since it gave the Dutch nothing they did not already hold. Arlington and Buckingham then met with Louis and agreed the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July. This set out a list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace, but neither side placed any reliance on it. Leopold&#x27;s envoy in the Hague, François-Paul de Lisola, gave the States-General assurances of Imperial support and arranged for Spanish troops to hold the Dutch fortress cities of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Breda, releasing their garrisons for the field army.

A second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering fishing rights, £400,000, Sluys and Surinam, in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace. Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis demanded the Dutch cede their naval base at Hellevoetsluis to England, a demand he knew was unacceptable. After the terms were rejected on 20 July, Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.

Johan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles&#x27; letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th. The Orangist Gaspar Fagel became Grand Pensionary, and on 27 August the States of Holland banned their political opponents from a local office, securing William&#x27;s political position.

=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===
On 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance. This gave the States time to enact the military reforms approved on 16 July, while they were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French. In addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold promised to invade the Rhineland and Alsace with 16,000 troops, along with the 20,000 promised by Frederick William in May.

This forced Louis to divert 40,000 men to meet this threat, with nearly 50,000 tied up in garrisons around the Republic. English hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, while the removal of the De Witts secured William&#x27;s position and ended his dependence on Charles. The Münster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen; the besiegers lost over 11,000 men, including 6,000 deserters, many of whom joined the Dutch.

William led attacks on Woerden and Charleroi, which were over-ambitious and unsuccessful but restored Dutch morale, while Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December. Although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May and Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war. This increased when the Dutch Cape Colony dispatched an expeditionary force to the English-held island of Saint Helena, and took possession on behalf of the Dutch East India Company.

== 1673 ==
=== Overview ===
After the French failed to breach the Holland Water Line, the Anglo-French fleet was tasked with defeating the Dutch navy, allowing them to blockade the Dutch coast and threaten the Republic with starvation, or land an invasion force. However, poor co-ordination meant they failed to exploit their numerical advantage, and De Ruyter was able to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed. Although the Battle of Texel on 21 August was inconclusive, it was a strategic Dutch victory as the damage inflicted on the English fleet forced them to return home for repairs.

Never popular to begin with, English support for the war dissolved along with hopes for a quick victory. In late 1673, the French withdrew from the Republic, and focused on conquering the Spanish Netherlands, a frightening prospect for most English politicians. Combined with a Dutch pamphlet campaign claiming Charles had agreed to restore Catholicism, Parliament refused to fund the war, while the level of opposition made Charles fear for his own position. In February 1674, the Second Peace of Westminster ended the war; it was greeted with popular enthusiasm in both countries, not least by commercial interests in Amsterdam and London, and the treaty was ratified with exceptional speed.

=== Naval battles ===
In the first two wars, both navies, particularly the Dutch, employed aggressive tactics that often resulted in heavy ship losses for the defeated side. In the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the priority was to minimise losses, and it was common for fleets to engage using the &quot;line-ahead&quot; formation, an essentially defensive approach; despite inflicting considerable damage, neither side lost any ships at the Texel.

When the Water Line froze during the winter of 1673, the French were unable to break it, thwarted by thin ice and companies of Dutch sailors equipped with ice skates, under Johan de Liefde. Attempts in the spring to drain the northern part of the line or cross on rafts also proved unsuccessful. With an eastern approach impractical, the Royal Navy was ordered to blockade the coast in co-operation with a French squadron; if possible, they were to land an invasion force, although how this would be accomplished was unclear. Lacking experience of amphibious operations, this meant capturing a Dutch port, despite limited knowledge of the dangerous shoals protecting their approaches.

Hoping to unnerve the Dutch, Prince Rupert leaked information claiming his fleet was accompanied by ships carrying an invasion force; in reality, it remained in Great Yarmouth, and was in any case insufficient for the task. In May, the English fleet of 81 ships approached the Dutch coast, while De Ruyter&#x27;s 55 ships took up a defensive position in the Schooneveld. Early on 7 June, Prince Rupert detached a light squadron, hoping to tempt De Ruyter into battle where the Allies could use their superior numbers. The alternative was forcing the Dutch fleet into Hellevoetsluis, where they could be blockaded while transports brought troops over to assault Den Briel or Vlissingen.

However, De Ruyter&#x27;s speed of response allowed him to attack before the main Allied fleet was ready, launching the First Battle of the Schooneveld. At Solebay the previous year, the French squadron had sailed in the opposite direction to that of the English; to counter accusations this had been deliberate, they now formed the centre squadron. However, their inexperience and poor positioning left gaps which allowed De Ruyter to sail through the Allied centre.

The French commanders had been ordered by Louis not to risk their ships, but focus on learning from the English and Dutch. They therefore disengaged, later writing enthusiastic reports about the tactical genius of the manoeuvre used by De Ruyter. Their defection threatened to cut off the Allied rear under Sir Edward Spragge; he took his own squadron to attack Tromp, who was also being engaged by Rupert, but fear of running aground meant this was not done with any conviction. Now split into four parts and in considerable confusion, the Allies withdrew after nine hours of fighting; they were not pursued, since De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks.

The Allies continued to hold their position off the Dutch coast; on 14 June, De Ruyter took advantage of favourable winds and launched the Second Battle of the Schooneveld. Once again, this caused chaos in the unprepared Allied fleet, which suffered severe damage and returned to the Thames for repairs. In late July, Rupert put to sea again, hoping to draw the Dutch north by feinting against The Hague or Den Helder; although De Ruyter preferred to remain where he was, he was ordered out to escort a valuable incoming Dutch East India Company treasure fleet. While both sides suffered severe damage in the resulting Battle of Texel, Prince Rupert was forced to return home for repairs.

The conduct of the French led to widespread recriminations and accusations they had failed to support their English colleagues. Whether this was fair remains a matter of dispute; in all three battles, De Ruyter took advantage of Allied deficiencies in fighting instructions and signalling. Regardless, it deepened suspicions between the English and French, further undercutting popular support for the war, while ending any hopes of starving the Dutch through a naval blockade. The result was an overwhelming strategic victory for the Dutch. even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands. For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: the Duke of York concluded that among admirals, &quot;he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world&quot;. The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea, and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.

On 24 August 1673, the Dutch recaptured the city New Amsterdam (renamed &quot;New York&quot; by the English) under Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and Captain Anthony Colve. Evertsen renamed the city &quot;New Orange&quot;. However, Dutch rule ended on 10 November 1674 with the order to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Westminster.

=== Anti-war sentiment in England ===
In previous conflicts, investing in privateers had been very profitable for the English, but from 1672 to 1673 Dutch raiders captured over 2,800 French and English ships, far more than their counterparts, The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers. Having failed to blockade the Dutch coast, English merchants were excluded from the vital Baltic trade in shipbuilding materials. In addition, the Dutch re-capture of New Amsterdam and attacks on English possessions in India caused further commercial damage. These losses compounded existing doubts about the war, which many felt was unjustified.

Stabilising their military position also restored Dutch credit, allowing the Estates to expand the military budget to a hundred million guilders, three times annual tax revenues. Louis had attacked the Republic hoping for a quick victory; once this failed, he faced a war of attrition on multiple fronts. In July 1673, French troops captured Maastricht; on 30 August, the Dutch agreed the Alliance of the Hague with Leopold and Spain. In October, they were joined by Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, whose duchy was occupied by France, forming the Quadruple Alliance.

William made sure the peace negotiations held in Cologne with France and England failed. In September, he recaptured Naarden, Münster and Cologne made peace, and French troops withdrew from the Dutch Republic, retaining only Grave and Maastricht. With victory over the Dutch now unlikely, the war became one for control of Flanders, an issue that divided England and France. Tensions between the two increased when Arlington&#x27;s former secretary Peter du Moulin fled to the Republic in early 1673. He started a propaganda campaign, flooding England with pamphlets accusing Charles and Louis of conspiring to make the country Catholic again.

Many were convinced of its truth, particularly when Charles gave permission for his brother and heir James to marry Mary of Modena, a devout Catholic. In February 1673, Parliament refused to approve further taxes unless Charles withdrew his proposed Indulgence and accepted a Test Act barring Catholics from public office. In June 1673, James resigned as Lord High Admiral, which was seen as confirmation of rumours he had secretly become a Catholic and could not comply with the Test Act. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, James&#x27; marriage now presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.

Buckingham, who learned of the secret provisions of the Treaty of Dover the previous year, reacted to the changed public mood by leaking them to other politicians, including Arlington. As a result, the Cabal Ministry joined those advocating peace with the Dutch; shocked by the revelation of Charles&#x27; agreement with Louis, Lord Shaftesbury began to consider removing the House of Stuart entirely. With his backing, John Locke developed the legal concepts that appeared in his work the Two Treatises of Government, a general denunciation of absolute monarchy.

== Second Peace of Westminster ==
In this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war. He informed the French ambassador Colbert de Croissy that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort. He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno, that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor &quot;indemnities&quot; could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles&#x27;s demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war &quot;against&quot; France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.

After a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the Treaty of Westminster was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style. It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.

The treaty stipulated that New York—formerly New Netherland—would henceforth be an English possession and that Suriname, captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667. An &quot;indemnity&quot; of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch. Eventually, William would force Charles to set off these indemnities against the debts he owed to the House of Orange, so the English king actually received very little.

Despite the peace, Monmouth&#x27;s brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War. In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties, at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him. In 1677, he forced his niece Mary to marry William; this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.

<doc id="87637" wikidata="Q261054" url="?curid=87637" title="Will Self">
<text>William Woodard Self (born 26 September 1961) is an English writer, journalist, political commentator and broadcaster. He has written 11 novels, five collections of shorter fiction, three novellas and nine collections of non-fiction writing. Self is currently Professor of Modern Thought at Brunel University London, where he teaches psychogeography.

His 2002 novel &quot;Dorian, an Imitation&quot; was longlisted for the Booker Prize, and his 2012 novel &quot;Umbrella&quot; was shortlisted. His fiction is known for being satirical, grotesque and fantastical, and is predominantly set within his home city of London. His writing often explores mental illness, drug abuse and psychiatry.

Self is a regular contributor to publications including &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. He has been a columnist for the &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The New European&quot;. His columns for &quot;Building Design&quot; on the built environment, and for the &quot;Independent Magazine&quot; on the psychology of place brought him to prominence as a thinker concerned with the politics of urbanism.

Self has also been a regular contributor to British television, initially as a guest on comic panel shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. In 2002, Self replaced Mark Lamarr on the BBC comedy panel show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; for two series, but was himself replaced by comedian Jack Dee when the programme returned in 2008. He has since appeared on current affairs programmes such as &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;Question Time&quot;. Self is a contributor to the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;A Point of View&quot;, to which he contributes radio essays delivered in his familiar &quot;lugubrious tones&quot;. In 2013, Self took part in discussions about becoming the inaugural BBC Radio 4 Writer-in-Residence, but later withdrew.

==Early life==
Self was born in Charing Cross Hospital and brought up in north London, between the suburbs of East Finchley and Hampstead Garden Suburb. His parents were Peter John Otter Self, Professor of Public Administration at the London School of Economics, and Elaine Rosenbloom, from Queens, New York, who worked as a publisher&#x27;s assistant. His paternal grandfather was Sir Albert Henry Self. Self spent a year living in Ithaca in upstate New York.

Self&#x27;s parents separated when he was nine, and divorced when he was 18. Despite the intellectual encouragement given by his parents, he was an emotionally confused and self-destructive child, harming himself with cigarette ends and knives before beginning to use drugs.

Self was a voracious reader from a young age. When he was 10, he developed an interest in works of science fiction such as Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and the works of J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick. Into his teenage years, Self claimed to have been &quot;overawed by the canon&quot;, which stifled his ability to express himself. Self&#x27;s use of drugs increased in step with his prolific reading. He started smoking cannabis at the age of 12, progressing by way of amphetamines, cocaine and LSD to heroin, which he started injecting at 18. Self struggled with mental health issues during this period, and aged 20 became a hospital outpatient.

Self attended University College School, an independent school for boys in Hampstead. He later attended Christ&#x27;s College, Finchley, from where he went to Exeter College, Oxford, reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics and graduated with a third class degree. At Oxford, he was editor of and frequent contributor to an underground left-wing student newspaper called &quot;Red Herring/Oxford Strumpet&quot;, copies of which are archived in the Bodleian Library.

==Career==

After graduating from Oxford, Self worked for the Greater London Council, including as a road sweeper, while residing in Brixton. He pursued a career as a cartoonist for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and other publications and as a stand-up comedian. He moved to Gloucester Road around 1985. In 1986 he entered a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare, where he claimed that his heroin addiction was cured. In 1989, &quot;through a series of accidents&quot;, he &quot;blagged&quot; his way into running a small publishing company.

The publication of his short story collection &quot;The Quantity Theory of Insanity&quot; brought him to public attention in 1991. Self was hailed as an original new talent by Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Beryl Bainbridge, A. S. Byatt and Bill Buford. In 1993, he was nominated by &quot;Granta&quot; magazine as one of the 20 &quot;Best Young British Novelists&quot;. Conversely, Self&#x27;s second book, &quot;My Idea of Fun&quot;, was &quot;mauled&quot; by the critics.

Self joined the &quot;Observer&quot; as a columnist in 1995. In 1997 when covering the election campaign of John Major, he was caught by a rival journalist using heroin on the Prime Minister&#x27;s jet; he was fired as a result. At the time, he argued &quot;I&#x27;m a hack who gets hired because I do drugs&quot;. He joined the &quot;Times&quot; as a columnist in 1997. In 1999 he left the &quot;Times&quot; to join the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;, which he left in 2002 for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

He has made many appearances on British television, especially as a panellist on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and as a regular on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;. Since 2008 Self has appeared five times on &quot;Question Time&quot;. He stopped appearing in &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, stating the show had become a &quot;pseudo&quot;-panel show. Between 2003 and 2006, he was a regular contributor to the BBC2 television series &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;.

Since 2009, Self has written two alternating fortnightly columns for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. &quot;The Madness of Crowds&quot; explores social phenomena and group behaviour, and in &quot;Real Meals&quot; he reviews high street food outlets. For a May 2014 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he wrote: &quot;the literary novel as an art work and a narrative art form central to our culture is indeed dying before our eyes&quot;, explaining in a July 2014 article that his royalty income had decreased &quot;dramatically&quot; over the previous decade. The July article followed the release of a study of the earnings of British authors that was commissioned by the Authors&#x27; Licensing and Collecting Society.

Self is a professor of Modern Thought at Brunel University London. He was appointed in 2012.

==Literary style==

Self has given his reason for writing as follows: &quot;I don&#x27;t write fiction for people to identify with and I don&#x27;t write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people.&quot; &quot;What excites me is to disturb the reader&#x27;s fundamental assumptions. I want to make them feel that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable.&quot;

When he was ten, he developed an interest in works of science fiction such as Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and those of J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick. Self admires the work of J. G. Ballard, Alasdair Gray and Martin Amis. He has said that he previously admired William Burroughs but went off him. He has cited influences such as Jonathan Swift, Franz Kafka, Lewis Carroll and Joseph Heller as formative influences on his writing style. Other influences on his fiction include Hunter S. Thompson. Self credits Céline&#x27;s book &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; with inspiring him to write fiction.

Zack Busner is a recurring character in Self&#x27;s fiction, appearing in the short story collections &quot;The Quantity Theory of Insanity&quot;, &quot;Grey Area&quot; and &quot;Dr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe&quot;, as well as in the novels &quot;Great Apes&quot;, &quot;The Book of Dave&quot;, &quot;Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Shark&quot;. Busner is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practising in London and is prone to self-promotion at the expense of his patients. He is often the antagonist of the stories he appears in, although not always with villainous intent.

Among Self&#x27;s admirers was the American critic Harold Bloom. Journalist Stuart Maconie has described him as &quot;that rarity in modern cultural life, a genuine intellectual with a bracing command of words and ideas who is also droll, likeable and culturally savvy.&quot;

==Political views==
In the 2015 UK general election Self voted Labour in a general election for the first time since 1997. In May 2015, he wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;No, I&#x27;m no longer a socialist if to be one is to believe that a socialist utopia is attainable by some collective feat of will – but I remain a socialist, if &#x27;socialism&#x27; is to be understood as an antipathy to vested interests and privileges neither deserved nor earned, and a strong desire for a genuinely egalitarian society.&quot; In March 2017, he wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;: &quot;Nowadays I think in terms of compassionate pragmatism: I&#x27;ll leave socialism to Žižek and the other bloviators.&quot;

In July 2015 Self endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said during a &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; interview that Corbyn represents a useful ideological divide within Labour, and could lead to the formation of a schism in the party.

Self is a republican.

==Personal life==
Will Self is married to the French novelist Nelly Kaprielian-Self.

He was previously married from 1989 to 1997 to Kate Chancellor. They have two children, a son, Alexis, and a daughter, Madeleine. They lived together in a terraced house just off the Portobello Road. In 1997, Self married journalist Deborah Orr, with whom he has sons Ivan and Luther. In 2017, Orr and Self separated, and Self was living in a rented flat in Stockwell. Orr died on 19 October 2019.

Self has stated that he has abstained from drugs, except for caffeine and nicotine, since 1998. In 2024 he wrote: &quot;I gave up smoking – and indeed, consuming nicotine in any way, shape or form – almost six years ago&quot;. In the same column he revealed that he had been diagnosed with myelofibrosis. It is a progression of the blood disease polycythaemia vera with which he was diagnosed in 2011.

He sent his younger children to private schools after they experienced bullying at state schools in Lambeth.

He has described himself as a psychogeographer and modern flâneur, and has written about walks he has taken. In December 2006, he walked from his home in South London to Heathrow Airport. Upon arriving at Kennedy Airport he walked from there to Manhattan. In August 2013, Self wrote of his anger following an incident in which he was stopped and questioned by police in Yorkshire while out walking with his 11-year-old son, on suspicion of being a paedophile. The police were alerted by a security guard at Bishop Burton College. He had asked the security guard for permission to cross the school grounds.

In September 2018 Self was accused of &quot;mental cruelty&quot; by Orr in relation to their divorce, in a series of posts on Twitter.

Self&#x27;s mother died in 1988. His 2024 novel Elaine is partially based on his mother&#x27;s diaries.

Self has discussed his Jewish heritage, by way of his mother, and its impact on his identity. In 2006, Self &#x27;resigned&#x27; as a Jew as a protest against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. In 2018 he stated in an interview with the BBC that he had rethought his position, due to the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Britain.

Self is tall, collects vintage typewriters and used to smoke a pipe. His brother is the author and journalist Jonathan Self.

Self became a vegetarian in 2019.

<text>Chita Oblast () was a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) in southeast Siberia, Russia. Its administrative center was the city of Chita. It had extensive international borders with China (998 km) and Mongolia (868 km) and internal borders with Irkutsk and Amur Oblasts, as well as with the republics of Buryatia and Yakutia. Its area was . Population: 

The oblast was established on September 26, 1937. On March 1, 2008, Chita Oblast merged with Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug to form Zabaykalsky Krai.

The territory that made up the former Chita Oblast was first explored by Cossacks led by Pyotr Beketov in 1653. People began to move into and develop the area in order to strengthen Russia&#x27;s border with China and Mongolia, extract mineral resources, and build the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1920, Chita became the capital of the Far East Republic, which merged with Russia in November 1922, a month before the USSR was constituted.

The oblast was rich in ferrous, non-ferrous, rare, and precious metals, coal, charcoal, and mineral waters. Russia&#x27;s estimated reserves of ores with a high uranium content are 145,400 tons. Most of these deposits are located in the former Chita Oblast, near Krasnokamensk, site of the Priargunsky Mining and Chemical Combine (PMCC). Forests cover about 60% of its territory. As a result, the oblast&#x27;s main industries were metallurgy, fuel, and timber. It also had advanced light and food industries. Local agriculture focused on cattle, sheep, and reindeer breeding.

==Administrative divisions==
==Demographics==
Birth rate: Quite high at 13.77 (2004), but still there were more deaths than births (2005 official figures).

The population were mostly Russians and Buryats, along with some Ukrainians and a few Evenks. There were 1,000 Jews, who mostly speak Yiddish in the regional capital. According to the 2002 census, Russians made up 89.8% of the population while Buryats were 6.1%. Other significant groups were Tatars (0.71%), Armenians (0.31%), Belarusians (0.26%), Azeri (0.18%), Evenks (0.13%), Nemts (0.11%), Chuvash (0.11%), Bashkirs (0.11%), Moldvins (0.07%), Mordvins (0.06%), Uzbeks (0.06%) and Dargwa (0.05%).

In 2007, Chita Oblast recorded a small natural population increase (+0.03% without taking any migration into account), becoming one of the only two Russian federal subjects to reverse its population decline in 2007. The other federal subject was Kamchatka Oblast, with a NGPR of +0.005%. Chita Oblast is one of only twenty Russian federal subjects to have a positive natural population growth, but the population of Chita actually decreased in 2007 due to very heavy emigration.

It aired for three seasons on the CBS network from September 26, 1964, to April 17, 1967. The series follows the comic adventures of seven castaways as they try to survive on an island where they are shipwrecked. Most episodes revolve around the dissimilar castaways&#x27; conflicts and their unsuccessful attempts to escape their plight, with the ship&#x27;s first mate, Gilligan, usually being responsible for the failures.

&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; ran for 98 episodes. All 36 episodes of the first season were filmed in black and white and were later colorized for syndication. The show&#x27;s second and third seasons (62 episodes) and the three television film sequels (broadcast between 1978 and 1982) were filmed in color.

&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; received solid ratings during its original run and grew in popularity during decades of syndication, especially in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, when many markets ran the show in the late afternoon.

== Premise ==
The two-person crew of the charter boat SS &quot;Minnow&quot; and five passengers on a &quot;three-hour tour&quot; from Honolulu run into a storm and are shipwrecked on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The exact location is said to be in conflicting longitudes/latitudes in three episodes. Their efforts to be rescued are typically thwarted by the negligent conduct of the hapless first mate, Gilligan. In 1997, show creator Sherwood Schwartz explained that the underlying concept, people with different characters and backgrounds being in a situation where they need to learn how to get along and cooperate to survive, is still &quot;the most important idea in the world today.&quot;

== Episodes ==

=== Pilot episode ===
The pilot episode, &quot;Marooned,&quot; was filmed in November 1963. The pilot featured seven characters (as in the series), but only four of the characters—and their associated actors—were carried forward into the series: Gilligan (Denver), the Skipper (Hale), and the Howells (Backus and Schafer).

Because of the three significant character and casting changes between the pilot episode and the first series episode, the pilot was not shown before the series first aired on September 26, 1964. The original pilot eventually aired over 29 years later on TBS.

The three characters who did not carry forward from the pilot were two secretaries and a high school teacher. In the pilot, the scientifically inclined Professor was instead a high school teacher played by John Gabriel. Ginger, the movie star, was still red-haired, but she worked as a secretary and was played by Kit Smythe. She was more sarcastic than the later incarnation. Mary Ann, the Kansas farm girl, was instead Bunny, Ginger&#x27;s co-worker, played as a cheerful &quot;dumb blonde&quot; by Nancy McCarthy.

The pilot&#x27;s opening and ending songs were two similar calypso-styled tracks written by John Williams and performed by Sherwood Schwartz impersonating singer Sir Lancelot. The lyrics of both differ from those of the TV series, and the pilot&#x27;s opening theme song is longer. The short scenes during this initial music include Gilligan taking the Howells&#x27; luggage to the boat before cast-off and Gilligan trying to give a cup of coffee to the Skipper during the storm that would ultimately maroon the vessel.

After the opening theme song and credits end, the pilot proper begins with the seven castaways waking up on the beached SS &quot;Minnow&quot;. It continues with them performing various tasks, including exploring the island, trying to fix the transmitter, building huts, and finding food. Contrary to some descriptions, the pilot contained no detailed accounts of the characters&#x27; backgrounds. It concludes with the ending theme song and credits. The background music and even the laugh tracks of the pilot appear nearly identical to those used during the series.

=== First broadcast episode ===
The first episode broadcast, &quot;Two on a Raft,&quot; is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the series pilot. This episode begins with the theme song performed by the Wellingtons and then the same scene of Gilligan and the Skipper awakening on the boat as in the pilot (though slightly differently cut to eliminate most shots of the departed actors) and continues with the characters sitting on the beach listening to a radio news report about their disappearance. No equivalent scene or background information is in the pilot, except for the description of the passengers in the original theme song. Rather than reshooting the rest of the pilot story for broadcast, the show proceeded. The plot thus skips over the topics of the pilot; the bulk of the episode tells of Gilligan and the Skipper setting off on a raft to try to bring help but unknowingly landing back on the other side of the same island.

The scene with the radio report is one of two scenes that reveal the names of the Skipper (Jonas Grumby) and the Professor (Roy Hinkley); the names are used in a similar radio report early in the series. The name Jonas Grumby appears nowhere else in the series except for an episode in which the Maritime Board of Review blames the Skipper for the loss of the &quot;Minnow&quot;. The name Roy Hinkley is used one other time when Mr. Howell introduces the Professor as Roy Huntley, and the Professor corrects him, to which Mr. Howell replies, &quot;Brinkley, Brinkley.&quot;

The plot for the pilot episode was recycled into that season&#x27;s Christmas episode, &quot;Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk,&quot; in which the story of the pilot episode, concerning the practical problems on landing, is related through a series of flashbacks. Footage featuring characters that had been recast was reshot using the current actors. For scenes including only Denver, Hale, Backus, and Schafer, the original footage was reused.

=== Last broadcast episode ===
The last episode of the show, &quot;Gilligan the Goddess&quot;, aired on April 17, 1967, and ended just like the rest, with the castaways still stranded on the island. It was not known at the time that it would be the series finale, as a fourth season was expected but then canceled.

== Typical plots ==
The shipwrecked castaways are desperate to leave the island, and various opportunities frequently present themselves but invariably fail, nearly always due to some bumbling error committed by Gilligan. Sometimes, this results in Gilligan saving the others from some unforeseen flaw in their plan. The only episode in which the entire cast leaves the island (albeit temporarily) is &quot;The Friendly Physician&quot; aired in Season 2.

Most episodes of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; use variations of five recurring basic plots:

* Life on the island. A running gag is the castaways&#x27; ability to fashion various useful objects from bamboo, coconuts, gourds, vines, and other local materials. Some are everyday items, such as eating and cooking utensils, while others (such as a dental drill and a remarkably efficient lie detector apparatus) are stretches of the imagination. Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. These bamboo items include framed huts with thatched grass sides and roofs, bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain, a communal dining table and chairs, Gilligan&#x27;s hot water pipes, a stethoscope, and a pedal-powered car.
* Visitors to the island. Another challenge to a viewer&#x27;s suspension of disbelief is the remarkable frequency with which an assortment of people visit the remote, uncharted island, all of whom either refuse or fail to help rescue the castaways.
* Dream sequences in which one of the castaways dreams they are some character related to that week&#x27;s storyline. All of the castaways appeared as other characters within the dream. In later interviews and memoirs, nearly all the actors stated that the dream episodes were among their favorites.
* A piece of news concerning one or more of the castaways is heard over the radio and causes distress or discord among them.
* The appearance or arrival of unusual objects to the island, such as a World War II naval mine, an old silent motion picture camera and costumes, a crate of radioactive vegetable seeds, plastic explosives, a robot, a live lion, a jet pack, or a wayward &quot;Mars Lander&quot; that the scientists who launched it think is sending them pictures of life on Mars.

Most of the slapstick comedic sequences between Hale and Denver were inspired by Laurel and Hardy, particularly when Hale breaks the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera, expressing his frustration with Denver&#x27;s clumsiness, as Oliver Hardy often did.

===Guest stars===
Although most episodes do not have guest stars given the characters are on an uncharted, unknown island, a remarkable number of people manage to find their way to the episode - and to leave without helping the castaways also escape. Among the actors who guest starred were Larry Storch, Kurt Russell, Rory Calhoun, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Hans Conreid, Don Rickles, Strother Martin, John McGiver, Denny Miller, Phil Silvers, Richard Kiel, and pop group The Wellingtons (folk group).

=== Dream sequences ===

One of the trademarks of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; is its frequent use of dream sequences. The showrunners used this device to expand beyond the premise&#x27;s limited setting, and to showcase the cast&#x27;s acting talents. Many episodes that feature dream sequences are ranked among the show&#x27;s most memorable episodes, as most of them parodied or drew inspiration from works of literature, film, and other television shows of the day.

Each dream sequence is triggered by the real-life situation of the episode and usually features symbolism that prompted a change of heart in whichever castaway was dreaming. Of the fourteen dream episodes, eleven feature a Gilligan dream (with one of these episodes including short dreams of each of the male cast members). Mr. Howell, Mrs. Howell, and Mary Ann each have an episode centering on a dream of theirs, making Mr. Howell the only cast member besides Gilligan who has more than one dream sequence. Skipper is presented as a woman in two dreams, although in one this is only a disguise; in Mrs. Howell&#x27;s dream he is both her wicked stepmother and a different male character, making him the only cast member to have two roles in one dream and also the only one to be the opposite sex in a dream. The Professor appears twice as a faux Cary Grant: in Mary Ann&#x27;s dream, and his own short dream. Ginger is the only one of the seven castaways who never had a dream sequence.

* &quot;The Sound of Quacking&quot; (S1E7) — Inspired by &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Afraid that the starving castaways will eat his pet duck, Emily, Gilligan dreams that he is U.S. Marshal Gilligan, whose primary task is keeping the rowdy citizens of his town from eating Emily, who he keeps locked in a jail cell. Features the Skipper as the Marshal&#x27;s limping deputy, Ginger as a sultry saloon girl, Mary Ann as the Marshal&#x27;s sweetheart, Mrs. Howell as a duck-gravy-making Spanish señora, and Mr. Howell and the Professor as a lynch mob.
* &quot;St. Gilligan and the Dragon&quot; (S1E20) — All four men react to the girls&#x27; recent demand for equal rights by having dreams that reflect what they expect from their women. The Skipper dreams of being a sultan with Ginger, Mary Ann, and Mrs. Howell as his dancing girls. Mr. Howell dreams of relaxing in a spa with all three girls catering to his every whim. The Professor dreams that he is Cary Grant emerging from his dressing room only to be assaulted by the girls, his crazed fans. Gilligan, always childlike, dreams that he is a bullfighter and that the girls each bring him a gift.
* &quot;My Fair Gilligan&quot; (S1E35) — Gilligan&#x27;s fears of his new life as the Howells&#x27; adopted son manifest when he dreams that he is a spoiled prince who callously orders the beheadings of any supplicant who displeases him. Features Mr. and Mrs. Howell as the pampering King and Queen, Mary Ann as a shepherd girl, the Professor as a wizardly astronomer, Ginger as a simpering court lady, and the Skipper as a naval admiral.
* &quot;The Little Dictator&quot; (S2E3) — Having just been appointed the puppet ruler of the island, Gilligan dreams that he is the dictator of a small foreign country on the brink of war, and the other castaways serve as his cabinet, who desperately try to convince him to look out his window at the chaos outside. Features Mr. Howell as the minister of finance, the Skipper as the secretary of the navy, Ginger as an undercover agent, the other castaways as cabinet members, and guest star Nehemiah Persoff as the masterminding dictator. It is notable for being the only dream sequence to feature a guest star as a main character.
* &quot;The Sweepstakes&quot; (S2E5) — Obsessed with finding Gilligan&#x27;s lost sweepstake ticket, Mr. Howell dreams that he is a grizzled prospector in the Old West who has just struck millions of dollars worth of gold, but the kingly treatment he receives in town is quickly revoked when he realizes that he doesn&#x27;t have proof of his claim. Features the Professor as a crooked bank owner, Gilligan as the corrupt U.S. Marshal, Ginger as a smooth-talking saloon owner, Mary Ann as an impoverished country girl, and the Skipper as a cheating gambler. It is notable for being one of the few dream sequences in which one of the castaways does not appear (Mrs. Howell, in this case). Jim Backus reprised his role as the prospector in the three-part Grand Canyon episode in the third season of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.
* &quot;The Postman Cometh&quot; (S2E18) — Inspired by &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; and &quot;Ben Casey&quot;. Afraid that she is going to die from eating poisonous mushrooms, Mary Ann falls asleep listening to her medical soap opera radio show and dreams that she is a patient in a hospital for a fatal disease. Features Mr. Howell as the kooky Dr. Zorbagillespie, Gilligan as Dr. Charles Boyer, the Skipper as Dr. Matt Dillon, the Professor as Dr. Cary Grant, and Mrs. Howell and Ginger as somewhat sympathetic nurses.
* &quot;V for Vitamins&quot; (S2E30) — Inspired by the &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;. Gilligan falls asleep while guarding the last of the castaways&#x27; citrus rations and dreams that he is a farm boy named Jack tasked with retrieving oranges for his starving family. Still, he buys magic beans, climbs a beanstalk, and enters a giant&#x27;s castle. Features Mrs. Howell as Jack&#x27;s mother, Mr. Howell as a W.C. Fields-inspired gangster, Mary Ann as the Giant&#x27;s helpful maid, the Skipper as the Giant, and Ginger and the Professor as elderly captives in the Giant&#x27;s dungeon. In the sequence where Jack runs from the Giant, Bob Denver&#x27;s young son Patrick plays Jack and uses a forced perspective to make Jack look extra small.
* &quot;Meet the Meteor&quot; (S2E32) — When the Professor&#x27;s measurements of radiation on a newly crashed meteor show it to be lethal, Gilligan dreams that the castaways have aged to extreme feebleness in only a few days. The castaways hobble from their huts to the dining table to celebrate one final anniversary on the island before they die of old age or an electrical storm destroys the island.
* &quot;Up at Bat&quot; (S3E1) — Inspired by &quot;Dracula&quot; and Sherlock Holmes. After supposedly being bitten by a vampire bat, Gilligan dreams that he is a ghoulish vampire inhabiting a haunted castle and eagerly awaiting the arrival of his guests, who also double as his dinner. It features Ginger as the vampire&#x27;s ghostly wife, the Professor as Sherlock Holmes, and the Skipper as Dr. Watson (renamed &quot;Colonel Watney&quot;), Mr. and Mrs. Howell as unsuspecting guests in the house, and Mary Ann as the hideous housekeeper. Notable for being filmed on the same haunted mansion set from the earlier episode &quot;The Friendly Physician&quot; (S2E29) and for concluding with a brawl featuring superimposed onomatopoeic words in the style of rival series &quot;Batman&quot;.
* &quot;The Invasion&quot; (S3E11) — Inspired by James Bond. Gilligan&#x27;s fears of being hunted down by secret agents show up in his dream, in which he is suave spy Agent 014 fighting against a criminal empire and its formidable group of assassins out to kill him and take away his top-secret briefcase. Features the Professor as the Chief Good Guy, Mr. Howell as Mr. Evil (inspired by Ernst Stavro Blofeld), Mrs. Howell as Mr. Evil&#x27;s moll, Mary Ann as the deadly receptionist, Ginger as Gilligan&#x27;s treacherous fiancée, and the Skipper as an evil agent disguised as Gilligan&#x27;s mother.
* &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (S3E13) — Inspired by &quot;Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde&quot;. Gilligan believes that he may be a murderous psychopath and dreams that he is on trial as an Oscar Wilde-style Doctor Gilligan, who transforms into a hideous monster at the mention of food. Features Mrs. Howell as his defense attorney Mary Poppins (renamed &quot;Mary Poplin&quot;), Mary Ann as the loyal Eliza Doolittle (who has confused Henry Jekyll for Henry Higgins), Ginger as the Lady in Red, Mr. Howell as a biased judge, the Professor as the prosecuting attorney, and the Skipper as the bailiff.
* &quot;Court-Martial&quot; (S3E17) — Gilligan dreams that he is Lord Admiral Gilligan, the youngest in the British fleet, charged with protecting the three noble ladies onboard when the ship is attacked and captured by uncouth pirates. Features Mr. Howell as Captain Hook, the Professor as Long John Silver, the Skipper as Captain Kidd, Mrs. Howell as the queen mother, and Ginger and Mary Ann as her daughters.
* &quot;Lovey&#x27;s Secret Admirer&quot; (S3E19) — Inspired by &quot;Cinderella&quot;. After a fight with her husband, Mrs. Howell dreams of being Cinderella, oppressed by her wicked stepfamily but determined to attend the royal ball and meet the prince. Features the Skipper as Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother, Ginger, and Mary Ann as the ugly stepsisters, Gilligan as the inept Fairy Godfather, Mr. Howell as the self-absorbed prince, and the Skipper and the Professor as pages.
* &quot;The Secret of Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (S3E25) — Gilligan&#x27;s discovery of an ancient stone tablet on the island leads him to dream that he and the castaways are cave people, each with a goal or fear about leaving their familiar caves in search of a better land. Features Gilligan as an artistic stonecutter, the Skipper as his best friend, Mr. Howell as the dictatorial chief, Mrs. Howell as his jealous wife, Ginger, and Mary Ann as cave girls seeking husbands, and the Professor as an inventor.

== Production ==
The show was filmed at the CBS Radford Studios complex in Studio City, Los Angeles. The same stage was later used for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;, the latter of which featured a daydream parodying &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; in one episode. The lagoon was drained and used as a parking lot during the show&#x27;s off-season. It was the last surviving element of the show, which was demolished in 1997 as part of an expansion project.

Four boats were used as the SS &quot;Minnow&quot;. One was used in the opening credits and rented in Ala Wai Yacht Harbor in Honolulu. Another, the &quot;Bluejacket&quot;, was used in the opening credits shown during the second and third seasons and eventually turned up for sale on Vancouver Island in August 2006 after running aground on a reef in the Hecate Strait on the way south from Alaska. One boat was used for beach scenes after being towed to Kauai in Hawaii. The fourth &quot;Minnow&quot; was built on the CBS Studios set in the second season. The &quot;Minnow&quot; was named in reference to Newton Minow, chairman of the U.S. FCC, in response to Minow&#x27;s landmark 1961 speech &quot;Television and the Public Interest&quot;; the speech lambasted television producers for producing, among other things, &quot;formula comedies about totally unbelievable&quot; characters and creating a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; of bad television.

The final day of filming the pilot was Friday, November 22, 1963, the day of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cast and crew learned of the assassination late that morning, Hawaii time. Between the filming of scenes, they crowded around a radio listening to news bulletins. A reminder of the tragedy appears in the opening sequence of the show&#x27;s first season when the theme song is played. As the &quot;Minnow&quot; is leaving the harbor and heading out to sea, an American flag flying at half staff can be seen in the background.

=== Casting ===
Bob Denver was not the first choice to play Gilligan; actor Jerry Van Dyke was offered the role, but he turned it down, believing that the show would never be successful. He chose instead to play the lead in &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;, which premiered the following year and is frequently cited as one of the worst television shows of all time; it was canceled after one season. The producers looked to Bob Denver, the actor who had played Maynard G. Krebs, the beatnik in &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

Natalie Schafer had it written into her contract that no close-ups would be made of her, but it was forgotten after a while in the series. Schafer was 63 when the pilot was shot, although, reportedly, no one on the set or in the cast knew her actual age, and she refused to divulge it. Initially, she accepted the role only because the pilot was filmed on location in Hawaii. She looked at the job as nothing more than a free vacation, as she was convinced that a show this silly would &quot;never go.&quot;

Tina Louise clashed with producer Sherwood Schwartz because she initially believed she was hired as the central character. The character of Ginger was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play her as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play Ginger as a Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield type. Her temperament reportedly made her difficult to work with, but she was always professional when it came time to shoot. Louise continued to disagree with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to appear in any of the three post-series TV movies. After many years of distancing herself from the show, she appeared in a reunion of the cast on two television talk shows in 1982 and 1988 and on an episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; in 1995 when the &quot;Roseanne&quot; cast re-enacted &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger was played by actress Kit Smythe.

Russell Johnson played the part of the Professor. John Gabriel was initially cast as the academic character, a high school teacher. After testing, the network didn&#x27;t believe the character scored well with the audience. Auditions were held for the revised role of the Professor, which included Dabney Coleman, but the part was ultimately won by Russell Johnson. Before his acting career, Johnson had served as a bombardier in 44 combat missions over the Pacific during World War II. On March 4, 1945, the B-25 he was flying as the navigator was shot down, killing the copilot and breaking both of Johnson&#x27;s ankles. At the time of his audition, he worked primarily in movies and was not very interested in a television show unless he would be the leading character. His film career had been going well, tallying several science fiction and Western film credits, including a role opposite Ronald Reagan in the 1953 film &quot;Law and Order&quot;. In addition to movies, Johnson had landed roles in multiple popular television series such as &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. With six other leads, his agent had to talk him into going to the audition, but after meeting Sherwood Schwartz, he started to warm up to the idea of playing the Professor. In discussing his role, he laughingly said he was unsure what was more difficult, remembering the Professor&#x27;s technically oriented lines or looking up what they meant. 

Dawn Wells was a former Miss Nevada when she auditioned for the Mary Ann role. Her competition included Raquel Welch and Pat Priest. The pilot episode featured a different character (&quot;Bunny&quot;) played by actress Nancy McCarthy. After it was shot, the network decided to recast the roles of the Professor and the two young women. Mary Ann became a simple farm girl from Winfield, Kansas.

=== Theme song ===
The music and lyrics for the theme song, &quot;The Ballad of Gilligan&#x27;s Isle&quot;, were written by Sherwood Schwartz and George Wyle. One version was used for the first season and another for the second and third seasons. In the original song, the Professor and Mary Ann, originally considered &quot;second-billed co-stars,&quot; were referred to as &quot;the rest.&quot; However, with the growing popularity of those characters, their names were inserted into the lyrics in the second season. The &quot;Gilligan&quot; theme song underwent this one major change because star Bob Denver personally asked studio executives to add Johnson and Wells to the song. When the studio at first refused, saying it would be too expensive to reshoot, Denver insisted, even going so far as to state that if Johnson and Wells were not included, he wanted his name out of the song as well. The studio caved in, and &quot;the Professor and Mary Ann&quot; were added. The theme song in the original pilot did not even mention the character Ginger, with the last two mentioned by name being &quot;the Millionaire and Mrs. Millionaire&quot; followed by &quot;...and the other tourists&quot;.

The first-season version was recorded by the folk group The Wellingtons. The second-season version, which incorporated more of a sea shanty sound, was uncredited, but according to Russell Johnson in his book &quot;Here on Gilligan&#x27;s Isle&quot;, it was performed by a group called the Eligibles.

The show&#x27;s original pilot episode featured a calypso theme song by future film composer John Williams and different lyrics. The original length of the voyage was &quot;a six-hour ride,&quot; not &quot;a three-hour tour.&quot; John Williams (or Johnny Williams as he was often listed in the show credits) was the initial composer of the incidental music for the show (from 1964 to 1965), but was replaced by Gerald Fried for the remaining seasons (1965–1967).

==== Later parodies and homages ====
The band Little Roger and the Goosebumps recorded &quot;Stairway to Gilligan&#x27;s Island,&quot; a parody of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; substituting the words to the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; theme song. In 1987, The Iceman parodied Madonna&#x27;s &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; as &quot;La Isla Gilligan&quot;. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic recorded a song called &quot;Isle Thing,&quot; a parody of Tone Lōc&#x27;s &quot;Wild Thing,&quot; about a rapper whose girlfriend introduces him to the show. Yankovic also mentions the show in his song &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Car Around,&quot; and he used one verse from the closing theme lyrics in &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; (1996), a parody of Coolio&#x27;s &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1995). The song has also been covered by many bands, including Bowling for Soup for the TBS show &quot;The Real Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Israel Kamakawiwoole also recorded a comic tribute to the theme song on his album E Ala E. The chorus to rap group Big Tymers&#x27; &quot;Still Fly&quot; is based on the Gilligan&#x27;s Island theme song.

== Cancellation ==
During the 1966–1967 television season, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; aired on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time. Although the sitcom&#x27;s ratings had fallen well out of the top-30 programs, during the last few weeks of its third season, the series was still winning its timeslot against its main competition, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, which aired at the same time on NBC-TV. Therefore, CBS assured Sherwood Schwartz that &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; would be picked up for a fourth year.

CBS, however, had signaled its intention to cancel the long-running Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, which had been airing late on Saturday nights during the 1966–1967 television season. Under pressure from CBS network president William S. Paley and his wife Babe, along with many network affiliates and longtime fans of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, CBS rescheduled the Western to an earlier time slot on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time. As a result, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; was quietly canceled at practically the last minute while the cast members were all on vacation. Based on Sherwood Schwartz&#x27;s verbal confirmation that the series would be renewed for a fourth season, some of the cast had bought houses near the set.

== Nielsen ratings/television schedule ==

== Film sequels ==
Three television film sequels were made—the first independently, the other two by MCA/Universal Television.

In the 1978 TV film, &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, the castaways successfully leave the island but have difficulty reintegrating into society. During a reunion cruise on the first Christmas after their rescue, fate intervenes, and they find themselves wrecked on the same island at the end of the film. It starred the original cast, except for Tina Louise, who refused to participate because of her disputes with the producers and was replaced by Judith Baldwin. The plot involved Soviet agents seeking a memory disc from a spy satellite that landed on the island and facilitated the protagonists&#x27; rescue.

In a 1979 sequel, &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, they are rescued once again, and the Howells convert the island into a getaway resort with the other five castaways as &quot;silent partners.&quot; Ginger was again played by Judith Baldwin.

In a 1981 sequel, &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, villains played by Martin Landau and then-wife Barbara Bain try to take over the island to gain access to a vein of &quot;supremium&quot;, a valuable but volatile fictional element. This time, Ginger was played by Constance Forslund. They are thwarted by the timely intervention of the Harlem Globetrotters. Jim Backus, who was in poor health then, was written out of the script by saying Thurston Howell III was tending to Howell Industries back on the mainland. David Ruprecht played the role of his son, Thurston Howell IV, who was asked to manage the resort. However, Backus insisted on maintaining continuity and made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.

In September 1992, it was reported Sherwood Schwartz and his son Lloyd J. Schwartz were negotiating a possible feature film adaptation titled &quot;Gilligan’s Island: The Movie&quot; with Ted Turner and Columbia Pictures. 

In 2008, Sherwood Schwartz stated he would like a modern-day movie adaptation of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; with Michael Cera as Gilligan and Beyonce Knowles as Ginger.

== Spin-offs and timelines ==
&quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; is a Filmation-produced animated remake that aired on ABC on Saturday mornings from September 7, 1974, to September 4, 1977, for 24 episodes (16 installments airing in 1974–75 and eight new ones combined with repeats in 1975–76). The voices were provided by the original cast except for Ginger and Mary Ann (both were voiced by Jane Webb). Dawn Wells could not participate because she was in a touring production. An additional character was Gilligan&#x27;s pet, Snubby the Monkey.

&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; is an animated science-fiction version produced by Filmation and starring the voices of the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; cast, save for Tina Louise (Dawn Wells voiced both Mary Ann and Ginger). In a follow-up to &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot;, the castaways escape from the island by building a spaceship and get shipwrecked on a distant planet. Only 13 episodes aired on CBS between September 18, 1982, and September 3, 1983. In the episode &quot;Let Sleeping Minnows Lie&quot;, they travel to an island and get shipwrecked there, and Gilligan observes, &quot;First we were stranded on an island, then we were stranded on a planet, and now we&#x27;re stranded on an island on a planet.&quot;

* &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island: The Musical&quot; was first produced in the early 1990s. Its script was by Lloyd Schwartz, Sherwood Schwartz&#x27;s son, and its songs were written by Schwartz&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law, Hope and Laurence Juber.
* &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Wake&quot; is a 2003 parallel novel loosely based on the 1960s CBS sitcom, from the viewpoints of the seven major characters, written by &quot;Esquire&quot; film and television critic Tom Carson. The title is derived from the title of the TV show and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, the seminal work of Irish novelist James Joyce.
* On November 30, 2004, the TBS network launched a reality series titled &quot;The Real Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which placed two groups of people on an island, leaving them to fend for themselves in the manner of &quot;Survivor&quot; – the catch being that each islander matched a character type established in the original series (a klutz, a sea captain, a movie star, a millionaire&#x27;s wife, etc.). While heavily marketed by TBS, the show turned out to be a flop with a very &quot;Survivor&quot;-like feel, but little of its success. A second season began June 8, 2005, with two-hour episodes for four weeks. TBS announced in July 2005 that a third season of the show would not be produced.

== Syndication ==
Syndication is handled by Warner Bros. Television (under Turner Entertainment Co., which in 1986 acquired United Artists Television&#x27;s share of the series as part of the classic pre-1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library). It aired on TBS from 1986 to 2003, where it also aired with colorization on season one for a while. TBS aired &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; weekday mornings at 8:05 a.m. ET throughout the 1990s, often paired with &quot;Bewitched&quot;. TNT aired it at some point in the 1990s and also aired the colorized season one. Nick at Nite later aired the series from 2000 to 2001. It then shifted to TV Land, where it aired from 2001 to 2003 and again from January to June 2014. In 2004, it aired on Hallmark Channel.

In 2015, the show started to air nationally on MeTV.

Warner/Turner also handles the two Filmation-produced animated sequel series, while other companies handle the three TV movie sequels.

In the UK, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; had a very brief run on ITV in April 1965, but it was dropped after 13 episodes.

It has briefly aired on MBC in the MENA region.

== Home media ==
Warner Home Video released all three seasons of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005. &quot;The Complete First Season&quot; features all 36 episodes unedited with the original theme song in their original black-and-white format. The special features include the rare pilot episode with commentary from creator Sherwood Schwartz and three other featurettes.

&quot;The Complete Second Season&quot; includes all 32 season-two episodes in color. Bonuses for this set include a season-two introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz and audio commentary on the season&#x27;s third episode, &quot;The Little Dictator&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Third Season&quot; includes all 30 season-three episodes. Special features include a season introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz, commentary on the season&#x27;s fourth episode, &quot;The Producer,&quot; guest-starring Phil Silvers, and a 15-minute documentary titled &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island: A Pop Culture Phenomenon&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Series Collection&quot; contains all the same bonuses and featurettes for a complete series box set in 2007. In April 2012, the series was reissued in new DVD releases.

The series is also available at the iTunes Store.

In August 2006, an executive at Warner Bros. announced plans that &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, in addition to other classic TV series owned by the studio, would be digitally re-mastered in HD. The original TV series was shot on high-resolution film but scaled down for broadcast.

On January 20, 2014, TV Land became the first network to air theatrical-style widescreen HD remastered episodes of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. This marked the first time fans and the general public saw the WB remastered episodes.

HD remastered episodes have been made available for purchase through streaming media sources.

== In other media ==
Two board games based on the show, both called &quot;The Gilligan&#x27;s Island Game&quot; featuring a monkey, Thurston Howell III, Gilligan and the Skipper on the box cover, were manufactured by Game Gems and released in 1965. &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot;, based on the short-lived cartoon of the same name and featuring all castaways, was manufactured by Milton Bradley and was released in 1974.

A set of trading cards was released by Topps in 1965. 
A pinball machine, manufactured by Bally and based on the show, was released in May 1991. 
A video game based on the series, called &quot;The Adventures of Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and manufactured by Bandai, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1990. The game features the likenesses of all the original castaways except for Ginger, who is absent from the game. A video slot machine, manufactured by International Game Technology and loosely based on the show, was released in 2004.

An officially licensed Gilligan&#x27;s Island-themed mini-golf course known as Gilligan&#x27;s Island Funland Golf is in operation in Garden City, South Carolina. The facility boasts two 18-hole courses, the &quot;Minnow&quot; and the &quot;Castaways&quot; courses. Both are listed as &quot;challenging,&quot; but all holes are presumably rated at Par 3.

== Ginger or Mary Ann? ==
The question of which of these two characters fans of the show prefer has endured long after the end of the series. The question has inspired commercials, essays, videos, and a sermon. By most accounts, the wholesome Mary Ann has consistently outpolled the glamorous movie-star Ginger by a sizable margin. Bob Denver admitted he was a Mary Ann fan. According to Denver in a 2001 interview, Wells received 3,000–5,000 fan letters weekly. In contrast, Louise may have had 1,500 or 2,000.

<text>Dassault Aviation SA () is a French manufacturer of military aircraft and business jets. It was founded in 1929 by Marcel Bloch as Société des Avions Marcel Bloch (Marcel Bloch Aircraft Company) or &quot;MB&quot;. After World War II, Marcel Bloch changed his name to Marcel Dassault, and the name of the company was changed to Avions Marcel Dassault on 20 January 1947.

In 1971 Dassault acquired Breguet, forming Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA). In 1990 the company was renamed Dassault Aviation, and is a subsidiary of Dassault Group.

Dassault Aviation has been headed by Éric Trappier since 9 January 2013.

==History==

The Société des Avions Marcel Bloch was founded by Marcel Bloch in 1929. In 1935 Bloch and Henry Potez entered into an agreement to buy &quot;Société Aérienne Bordelaise&quot; (SAB), subsequently renamed &quot;Société Aéronautique du Sud-Ouest&quot;. In 1936 the arms industry in France was nationalised as the &quot;Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Sud Ouest&quot; (SNCASO). Marcel Bloch was asked to act as delegated administrator of the Minister for Air. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany the country&#x27;s aviation industry was virtually disbanded. Marcel Bloch was imprisoned by the Vichy government in October 1940. In 1944 Bloch was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp by the German occupiers where he remained until it was liberated on 11 April 1945.

On 10 November 1945, at an extraordinary general meeting of the &quot;Société Anonyme des Avions Marcel Bloch&quot; the company voted to change its form to a limited liability entity, &quot;Société des Avions Marcel Bloch&quot;, which was to be a holding company. On 20 January 1947 &quot;Société des Avions Marcel Bloch&quot; became &quot;Société des Avions Marcel Dassault&quot; to reflect the name adopted by its owner.

In 1954, Dassault established an electronics division (by 1962 named &quot;Electronique Marcel Dassault&quot;), the first action of which was to begin the development of airborne radars, soon followed by seeker heads for air-to-air missiles, navigation, and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become a major part of Dassault&#x27;s business, major successes were the Dassault Mirage series and the Mystere-Falcon.

In 1965 and 1966, the French government stressed to its various defense suppliers the need to specialize to maintain viable companies. Dassault was to specialise in combat and business aircraft, Nord Aviation in ballistic missiles and Sud Aviation civil and military transport aircraft and helicopters. (Nord Aviation and Sud Aviation would merge in 1970 to form Aérospatiale which would itself later merge with 2 other firms and become EADS (now Airbus)).

On 27 June 1967, Dassault (at the urging of the French government) acquired 66% of Breguet Aviation. Under the merger deal Société des Avions Marcel Dassault was dissolved on 14 December 1971, with its assets vested in Breguet, to be renamed Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA).

Dassault Systèmes was established in 1981 to develop and market Dassault&#x27;s CAD program, CATIA. Dassault Systèmes was to become a market leader in this field.

In 1979 the French government took a 20% share in Dassault and established the Societé de Gestion de Participations Aéronautiques (SOGEPA) to manage this and an indirect 25% share in Aerospatiale (the government also held a direct 75% share in that company). In 1998 the French government transferred its shares in Dassault Aviation (45.76%) to Aerospatiale. On 10 July 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with other European companies to form EADS (presently Airbus).

In 2000 Serge Dassault resigned as chairman and was succeeded by Charles Edelstenne. Serge Dassault was appointed honorary chairman. The American company Atlantic Aviation based in Wilmington, Delaware, was acquired in October 2000.

Airbus sold some of its ownership back to Dassault in 2014, and further reduced its share to 27% in 2015 then to 10% in 2016.

In April 2024, it was announced that Serbia would sign a deal with Dassault worth £3 billion. This was the largest weapons deal in Serbian history. 

In late 2024, Dassault Falcon Jet delivered the first U.S.-based Part 91 Falcon 6X to Nimbl&#x27;s Ready Flight International program.

<text>Charles Perrault ( , ; ; 12 January 162816 May 1703) was a French author and member of the Académie Française. He laid the foundations for a new literary genre, the fairy tale, with his works derived from earlier folk tales, published in his 1697 book &quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passé&quot;. The best known of his tales include &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Bluebeard&quot;.

Some of Perrault&#x27;s versions of old stories influenced the German versions published by the Brothers Grimm more than 100 years later. The stories continue to be printed and have been adapted to most entertainment formats. Perrault was an influential figure in the 17th-century French literary scene and was the leader of the Modern faction during the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.

==Life and work==
Charles Perrault was born in Paris on 12 January 1628, to a wealthy bourgeois family and was the seventh child of Pierre Perrault (father) and Paquette Le Clerc. He attended very good schools and studied law before embarking on a career in government service, following in the footsteps of his father and elder brother Jean.

He took part in the creation of the Academy of Sciences as well as the restoration of the Academy of Painting. In 1654, he moved in with his brother Pierre, who had purchased the position of chief tax collector of the city of Paris. When the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres was founded in 1663, Perrault was appointed its secretary and served under Jean Baptiste Colbert, finance minister to King Louis XIV. Jean Chapelain, Amable de Bourzeys, and Jacques Cassagne (the King&#x27;s librarian) were also appointed. 

Using his influence as Colbert&#x27;s administrative aide, in April 1667 he was able to get his brother, Claude Perrault, appointed to a committee of three, the Petit Conseil, also including Louis Le Vau and Charles Le Brun, who designed the new section of the Louvre, the Colonnade, built between 1667 and 1674, to be overseen by Colbert. The design was chosen over designs by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (with whom, as Perrault recounts in his &quot;Memoirs,&quot; he had stormy relations while the Italian artist was in residence at Louis&#x27; court in 1665) and François Mansart. One of the factors leading to this choice included the fear of high costs, and second was the personal antagonism between Bernini and leading members of Louis&#x27; court, including Colbert and Perrault. King Louis himself maintained a public air of benevolence towards Bernini, ordering the issuing of a royal bronze portrait medal in honor of the artist in 1674. However, as Perrault further describes in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, the king harbored private resentment at Bernini&#x27;s displays of arrogance. The king was so displeased with Bernini&#x27;s equestrian statue of him that he ordered it to be destroyed; however, his courtiers prevailed upon him to have it redone instead, with a head depicting the Roman hero Marcus Curtius.

In 1668, Perrault wrote &quot;La Peinture&quot; (&quot;Painting&quot;) to honor the king&#x27;s first painter, Charles Le Brun. He also wrote &quot;Courses de tetes et de bague&quot; (&quot;Head and Ring Races&quot;, 1670), written to commemorate the 1662 celebrations staged by Louis for his mistress, Louise-Françoise de La Baume le Blanc, duchesse de La Vallière.
At Colbert&#x27;s instigation, Perrault was elected to the Académie française in 1671.

He married Marie Guichon, who was aged 19, in 1672. She died in 1678.

In 1669 Perrault advised Louis XIV to include thirty-nine fountains each representing one of the fables of Aesop in the labyrinth of Versailles in the gardens of Versailles. The work was carried out between 1672 and 1677. Water jets spurting from the animals&#x27; mouths were conceived to give the impression of speech between the creatures. There was a plaque with a caption and a quatrain written by the poet Isaac de Benserade next to each fountain. Perrault produced the guidebook for the labyrinth, &quot;Labyrinte de Versailles&quot;, printed at the royal press, Paris, in 1677, and illustrated by Sebastien le Clerc.

Philippe Quinault, a longtime family friend of the Perraults, quickly gained a reputation as the librettist for the new musical genre known as opera, collaborating with composer Jean-Baptiste Lully. After &quot;Alceste&quot; (1674) was denounced by traditionalists who rejected it for deviating from classical theater, Perrault wrote in response &quot;Critique de l&#x27;Opéra&quot; (1674), in which he praised the merits of &quot;Alceste&quot; over the tragedy of the same name by Euripides.

This treatise on &quot;Alceste&quot; initiated the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns (&quot;Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes&quot;), which pitted supporters of the literature of Antiquity (the &quot;Ancients&quot;) against supporters of the literature from the century of Louis XIV (the &quot;Moderns&quot;). He was on the side of the Moderns and wrote &quot;Le Siècle de Louis le Grand&quot; (&quot;The Century of Louis the Great&quot;, 1687) and &quot;Parallèle des Anciens et des Modernes&quot; (&quot;Parallel between Ancients and Moderns&quot;, 1688–1692) where he attempted to prove the superiority of the literature of his century. &quot;Le Siècle de Louis le Grand&quot; was written in celebration of Louis XIV&#x27;s recovery from a life-threatening operation. Perrault argued that because of Louis&#x27;s enlightened rule, the present age was superior in every respect to ancient times. He also claimed that even modern French literature was superior to the works of antiquity, and that, after all, .

In 1682, Colbert forced Perrault into retirement at the age of 56, assigning his tasks to his own son, Jules-Armand, marquis d&#x27;Ormoy. Colbert would die the next year, and Perrault stopped receiving the pension given to him as a writer. Colbert&#x27;s bitter rival succeeded him, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, and quickly removed Perrault from his other appointments.

After this, in 1686, Perrault decided to write epic poetry and show his genuine devotion to Christianity, writing &quot;Saint Paulin, évêque de Nôle&quot; (&quot;St. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola&quot;, about Paulinus of Nola). Just like Jean Chapelain&#x27;s &quot;La Pucelle, ou la France délivrée&quot;, an epic poem about Joan of Arc, Perrault became a target of mockery from Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux.

Charles Perrault died in Paris on 16 May 1703, at the age of 75. On 12 January 2016, Google honoured him with a doodle by artist Sophie Diao depicting characters from the &quot;Tales of Mother Goose&quot; (&quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passé&quot;).

==Fairy tales==

In 1695, when he was 67, Perrault lost his position as secretary and decided to dedicate himself to his children. In 1697 he published &quot;Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals&quot; (&quot;Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé, avec des moralités&quot;), subtitled &quot;Tales of Mother Goose&quot; (&quot;Les Contes de ma Mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;). (The spelling of the name is with &quot;y&quot; although modern French uses only an &quot;i&quot;.) This &quot;Mother Goose&quot; has never been identified as a person, but used to refer to popular and rural storytelling traditions in proverbial phrases of the time. (Source : &quot;Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie&quot;, 1694, quoted by Nathalie Froloff in her edition of the &quot;Tales&quot; (Gallimard, Folio, Paris, 1999.- p. 10).) These tales, based on European popular tradition, became very popular in France. Of all his abundant literary production in verse and in prose (odes, epic poetry, essays, etc.) these little stories for children are the only works still read today, and he is often credited as the founder of the modern fairy tale genre. Naturally, his work reflects awareness of earlier fairy tales written in the salons, most notably by Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, Baroness d&#x27;Aulnoy, who coined the phrase &quot;fairy tale&quot; and wrote tales as early as 1690.

Some of his popular stories, particularly &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, are still commonly told similar to the way Perrault had written them, while others have been revised over the years. For example, some versions of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; published today are based partially on a Brothers Grimm tale, &quot;Little Briar Rose&quot;, a modified version of the Perrault story.

Perrault had written &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; as a warning to readers about strangers preying on young girls walking through the forest. He concludes his fairy tale with a moral, cautioning women and young girls about the dangers of trusting men. He states: &quot;Watch out if you haven&#x27;t learned that tame wolves/ Are the most dangerous of all&quot;. Perrault warns the readers about the manipulation and false appearances some men portray: &quot;I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is one kind with an amenable disposition – neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!&quot; Indeed, in Perrault&#x27;s version, the girl gets into bed with the wolf and is devoured, lacking the happy ending found in most current versions of the story. 
He had actually published his collection under the name of his last son (born in 1678), Pierre (Perrault) Darmancourt (&quot;Armancourt&quot; being the name of a property he bought for him), probably fearful of criticism from the &quot;Ancients&quot;. In the tales, he used images from around him, such as the Chateau Ussé for &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and the Marquis of the Château d&#x27;Oiron as the model for the Marquis de Carabas in &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;. He ornamented his folktale subject matter with details, asides and subtext drawn from the world of fashion. Following up on these tales, he translated the &quot;Fabulae Centum&quot; (100 Fables) of the Latin poet Gabriele Faerno into French verse in 1699.

<doc id="87655" wikidata="Q133602" url="?curid=87655" title="Carolingian dynasty">
<text>The Carolingian dynasty ( ; known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings, Karolinger or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family named after Charles Martel and his grandson Charlemagne, descendants of the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The dynasty consolidated its power in the 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and &quot;dux et princeps Francorum&quot; hereditary, and becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty which had ruled the Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and Pepin the Short, son of Martel, was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of the Romans in the West in over three centuries. Nearly every monarch of France from Charlemagne&#x27;s son Louis the Pious until the penultimate monarch of France Louis Philippe have been his descendants and According to Oxford University, 75% of all royal families in European history, are related to the Capetian dynasty a cadet branch of the Karlings. Charlemagne&#x27;s death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire.

==Name==

The Carolingian dynasty takes its name from &quot;Carolus&quot;, the Latinised name of multiple Frankish kings including Charlemagne and Charles Martel. The name originates from a common Germanic word, rendered in Old High German as Karl or Kerl, meaning , , or .

==History==
=== Origins ===

==== Pippin I &amp; Arnulf of Metz (613–645) ====
The Carolingian line first began with two important rival Frankish families, the Pippinids and Arnulfings, whose destinies became intermingled in the early 7th century. Both men came from noble backgrounds on the western borders of the Austrasia territory between the Meuse and Moselle rivers, north of Liège.

The first two figures, Pippin I of Landen and Arnulf of Metz, from whom historians have taken the family names, both first appeared in the fourth book of the &quot;Continuations of Fredegar&quot; as advisers to Chlotar II of Neustria, who &#x27;incited&#x27; revolt against King Theuderic II and Brunhild of Austrasia in 613. Through shared interests, Pippin and Arnulf allied their families through the marriage of Pippin&#x27;s daughter Begga and Arnulf&#x27;s son Ansegisel.

As repayment for their help during the Austrasian conquest, Chlotar rewarded both men with important positions of power in Austrasia. However, Arnulf was the first to gain. He was bestowed the bishopric of Metz in 614, entrusting him with the management of the Austrasian capital and the education of Chlotar&#x27;s young son, the future Dagobert I. This is a position he would hold until his retirement in 629 after Chlotar&#x27;s death, when he left for a small ecclesiastical community near Habendum; he was later buried at the monastery of Remiremont after his death .

==== Pippin I (624–640) ====
Pippin was not immediately rewarded, but eventually was given the position of &quot;maior palatti&quot; or &#x27;mayor of the palace&#x27; of Austrasia in 624. This reward secured Pippin a position of prime importance with the Merovingian royal court. The mayor of the palace would act as the mediator between the King and the magnates of the region; as Paul Fouracre summarises, they were &#x27;regarded as the most important non-royal person in the kingdom.&#x27; The reason Pippin was not rewarded sooner is not certain, but two mayors, Rado (613 – ) and Chucus (), are believed to have preceded him and were potentially political rivals connected to the fellow Austrasian &#x27;Gundoinings&#x27; noble family. Once elected, Pippin served faithfully under Chlotar until the latter&#x27;s death in 629, and solidified the Pippinids&#x27; position of power within Austrasia by supporting Chlotar&#x27;s son Dagobert, who became King of Austrasia in 623. Pippin, with support from Arnulf and other Austrasian magnates, even used the opportunity to support the killing of an important political rival Chrodoald, an Agilolfing lord.

Following King Dagobert I&#x27;s ascent to the throne in , he returned the Frankish capital back to Paris in Neustria, from whence it had been removed by Chlotar in 613. As a result, Pippin lost his position as mayor and the support of the Austrasian magnates, who were seemingly irritated by his inability to persuade the King to return the political centre to Austrasia. Instead, Dagobert turned to the Pippinids&#x27; political rival family, the Gundoinings, whose connections in Adalgesil, Cunibert, archbishop of Cologne, Otto and Radulf (who would later revolt in 642) once again removed the Pippinid and Arnulfing influence in the Austrasia assemblies.

Pippin did not reappear in the historical record until Dagobert&#x27;s death in 638, when he had seemingly been reinstated as mayor of Austrasia and began to support the new young King Sigebert III. According to the &quot;Continuations&quot;, Pippin made arrangements with his rival, Archbishop Cunibert, to get Austrasian support for the 10-year-old King Sigibert III, who ruled Austrasia whilst his brother Clovis II ruled over Neustria and Burgundy. Soon after securing his position once again, he unexpectedly died in 640.

==== Grimoald (640–656) ====
Following Pippin&#x27;s sudden death, the Pippinid family worked swiftly to secure their position. Pippin&#x27;s daughter Gertrude and wife Itta founded and entered the Nivelles Abbey, and his only son Grimoald worked to secure his father&#x27;s position of &quot;maior palatii.&quot; The position was not hereditary and therefore passed to another Austrasian noble, Otto, the tutor of Sigebert III. According to the &quot;Continuations&quot;, Grimoald began to work with his father&#x27;s accomplice Cunibert to remove Otto from office. He finally succeeded in , when Leuthari II, Duke of Alamannia killed Otto under Grimoald&#x27;s and, we must assume, Cunibert&#x27;s orders. Grimoald then became mayor of Austrasia. His power at this time was extensive, with properties in Utrecht, Nijmegen, Tongeren and Maastricht; he was even called &#x27;ruler of the realm&#x27; by Desiderius of Cahors in 643.

This could not have been done if Grimoald had not secured Sigibert III&#x27;s support. The Pippinids already gained royal patronage from Pippin I&#x27;s support, but this was further bolstered by Grimoald&#x27;s role in Duke Radulf of Thuringia&#x27;s rebellion. Just prior to Otto&#x27;s assassination, in Radulf revolted against the Merovingians and made himself King of Thuringia. Sigibert, with an Austrasian army including Grimoald and Duke Adalgisel, went on campaign and after a brief victory against Fara, son of the assassinated Agilofing lord Chrodoald, the Austrasians met Radulf on the River Unstrut where he had set up a stronghold. What followed was a disorganized battle spread over several days, in which the Austrasian lords disagreed on tactics. Grimoald and Adalgesil strengthened their position by defending Sigibert&#x27;s interests, but could not establish a unanimous agreement. During their final assault, the &#x27;men of Mainz&#x27; betrayed the Austrasians and joined with Radulf. This penultimate battle killed many important Austrasian lords, including Duke Bobo and Count Innowales, and resulted in Sigibert&#x27;s defeat. The &quot;Continuations&quot; offers a famous description of Sigibert being &#x27;seized with the wildest grief and sat there on his horse weeping unrestrainedly for those he had lost&#x27; as Radulf returned to his camp victorious.

Upon Sigibert&#x27;s return from Unstruct, Grimoald, now mayor, began to build power for the Pippinid clan. He utilized the existing links between the family and ecclesiastical community to gain control over local holy men and women who, in turn, supported Pippinid assertions of power. Grimoald established links with Aquitanian and Columbianan missionaries Amandus and Remaclus, both of whom came to be influential bishops within the Merovingian court. Remaclus, in particular, was important as after becoming bishop of Maastricht, he established two monasteries: Stavelot Abbey and Malmedy. Under Grimoald&#x27;s direction, the Arnulfings were also further established with Chlodulf of Metz, son of St. Arnulf, taking the bishopric of Metz in 656.

==== Grimoald and Childebert (656–657) ====
The final moment of Grimoald&#x27;s life is an area that is disputed in both date and event, titled: &#x27;Grimoald&#x27;s coup&#x27;. It involves Grimoald and his son Childebert the Adopted taking the Austrasian throne from the true Merovingian King Dagobert II, son of the late Sigibert who died young at 26 years old. Historians like Pierre Riché are certain that Sigibert died in 656, having adopted Childebert due to his lack of an adult male heir. Following this, young Dagobert II was then exiled and tonsured by Grimoald and Dido of Poitiers, who then installed Childebert as King of Austrasia. Clovis II in Neustria, uncle to Dagobert, then reacted to the revolt and lured Grimoald and Childebert into Neustria, where they were executed.

This story is only confirmed by the pro-Neustrian source, the &quot;Liber Historia Francorum&quot; (&quot;LHF&quot;) and selected charter evidence. Other contemporary sources like the &quot;Continuations&quot; fail to mention the event and Carolingian sources like &quot;Annales Mettenses Priores&quot; (&quot;AMP&quot;) ignore the event and even deny Grimoald&#x27;s existence. As such, historian Richard Gerberding has suggested a different chronology and reading of the &quot;LHF&quot;, which places Sigibert&#x27;s death on 1 February 651. According to a Gerberding narrative, Grimoald and Dido organised Dagobert&#x27;s exile around 16 January 651 to Ireland at Nivelles and then, when Sigibert died a month later, they acted out the plan and tonsured Dagobert, replacing him with Childebert, who ruled until 657. Clovis II then immediately acted and invaded Austrasia, executing Grimoald and his son.

Then, either in 657 or 662, the Neustrians (either Clovis II who died in 657 or his son Chlothar III) installed infant King Childeric II to the throne of Austrasia, marrying him to Bilichild, the daughter of Sigibert&#x27;s widow Chimnechild of Burgundy. Grimoald and Childebert&#x27;s deaths brought an end to the direct Pippinid line of the family, leaving the Arnulfing descendants from Begga and Ansegisel to continue the faction.

==== Pippin II (676–714) ====
Very little is known about Pippin&#x27;s early life, but a controversial story from &quot;AMP&quot; suggests that Pippin reclaimed power in Austrasia by killing a legendary &#x27;Gundoin&#x27; as revenge for the assassination of his father Ansegisel. This story is regarded as slightly fantastical by Paul Fouracre, who argues the &quot;AMP,&quot; a pro-Carolingian source potentially written by Giselle (Charlemagne&#x27;s sister) in 805 at Chelles, is that Pippin&#x27;s role primes him perfectly for his future and demonstrates his family to be &#x27;natural leaders of Austrasia.&#x27; However, Fouracre does also acknowledge his existence in charter evidence and confirms that he was a political link to rival mayor Wulfoald. These rivalries would make Pippin natural enemies with Gundoin, making the murder plausible as part of Pippin&#x27;s rise to power.

===== Rise to power =====
The Arnulfing clan reappear in the contemporary historical record in , when the &quot;LHF&quot; mentions &#x27;Pippin and Martin&#x27; rising up against a tyrannical Ebroin, mayor of Austrasia. Pippin II, now head of the faction, and Martin, who was either Pippin&#x27;s brother or relative, rose up against Ebroin and gathered an army (potentially with the aid of Dagobert II who had been brought back to Austrasia by mayor Wulfoald). According to the &quot;LHF&quot;, the Arnulfing army met Ebroin, who had gained the support of King Theuderic III, at Bois-du-Fays, and they were easily defeated. Martin fled to Laon, from where he was lured and murdered by Ebroin at Asfeld. Pippin fled to Austrasia and soon received Ermenfred, an officer of a royal fisc who had assassinated Ebroin.

The Neustrians, with Ebroin dead, installed Waratto as mayor, and he looked for peace with the Austrasians. Despite an exchange of hostages, Warrato&#x27;s son Gistemar attacked Pippin at Namur and displaced his father. He died shortly thereafter and Warrato resumed his position, wherein peace was reached but tense relations remained until Warrato&#x27;s death in 686. He left behind his wife Ansfled and his son Berchar, whom the Neustrians installed as mayor. Against his father&#x27;s policy, Berchar did not maintain peace and incited Pippin into violence.

In 687, Pippin rallied an Austrasian army and led an assault on Neustria, facing Theuderic III and the Neustrian mayor, now Berchar, in combat. They met at the Battle of Tertry, where the &quot;AMP&quot; records that Pippin, after offering peace which was rejected by Theuderic at Berchar&#x27;s behest, crossed the river Omignon at the break of dawn and attacked the Neustrians, who believed the battle won when they saw Pippin&#x27;s camp abandoned. This surprise attack was successful and the Neustrians fled. Following this victory, Berchar was either killed, as the &quot;AMP&quot; argues, by his own people, but the &quot;LHF&quot; suggests that it is more likely that he was murdered by his mother-in-law, Ansfled. This moment was decisive in Arnulfing history as it was the first time that any of the faction had national control. Paul Fouracre even argues it is for this that the &quot;AMP&quot; starts with Pippin II, as a false dawn upon which Charles Martel would rebuild. However, historians have discredited the importance of this victory. Marios Costambeys, Matthew Innes and Simon MacLean all show that the Tertry victory did not establish solid authority over Neustria immediately, evidenced by the fact that Pippin immediately installed &#x27;Norbert, one of his followers&#x27; (as written in the &quot;LHF&quot;) and then his son Grimoald in 696 to ensure continued influence.

===== Consolidation of power =====
Pippin II then became overall mayor of the royal palace under Theuderic II, becoming mayor of Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy. His son Drogo, from his wife Plectrude, was also imbued with power when he married Berchar&#x27;s widow Adaltrude (potentially maneuvered by Ansfled) and was made Duke of Champagne. Pippin was politically dominating and had the power to elect the next two Merovingian kings after Theuderic II died in 691; he installed King Clovis IV (691-695), Childebert III (695-711) and Dagobert III (711-715). Pippin moved to secure further power by consolidating his position in Neustria, installing several bishops like Gripho, Bishop of Rouen and Bainus at the Abbey of Saint Wandrille in 701, which was later owned along with Fleury Abbey (founded by Pippin in 703). Imbued with internal strength, Pippin also began to look outwards from the Frankish Empire to subdue the people, that the &quot;AMP&quot; records, who once were &#x27;subjected to the Franks ... [such as] the Saxons, Frisians, Alemans, Bavarians, Aquitainians, Gascons and Britons.&#x27; Pippin defeated the pagan chieftain Radbod in Frisia, an area that had been slowly encroached upon by Austrasian nobles and Anglo-Saxon missionaries like Willibrord, whose links would later make him a connection between the Arnulfings and the papacy. Following Gotfrid, Duke of Alemannia in 709, Pippin also moved against the Alemans and subjugated them again to royal control.

===== Later years =====
As Pippin approached his death in late 714, he was faced with a succession crisis. Drogo, Pippin&#x27;s oldest son, died in 707 and his second son Grimoald, according to the &quot;LHF&quot;, was killed whilst praying to Saint Lambert in Liège in 714 by Rantgar, suspected by Paul Fouracre to be a pagan. Pippin, before his death, made his six-year-old grandson Theudoald (Grimoald&#x27;s son) his successor in Neustria, a choice that is believed to have been promoted by his wife Plectrude, which was clearly a political choice from within the direct family line, as Pippin had two adult illegitimate children, Charles Martel and Childebrand I, from a second wife or concubine named Alpaida. They were ousted so Theudoald (with Plectrude&#x27;s regency) could take the throne, a choice that would result in disaster.

===== Death =====
When Pippin II died in December 714, the Arnulfings&#x27; dominance over Francia disintegrated. The &quot;LHF&quot; tells us that &#x27;Plectrude along with her grandchildren and the king directed all the affairs of state under a separate government&#x27;, a system which created tensions with the Neustrians. Theudoald ruled uncontested for around six months, until June 715, when the Neustrians revolted. Theudoald and the Arnulfings&#x27; supporters met at the Battle of Compiègne on 26 September 715, and after a decisive victory, the Neustrians installed a new mayor Ragenfrid and, following Dagobert&#x27;s death, their own Merovingian king Chilperic II. Charter evidence suggests that Chilperic was the son of the former King Childeric II, but this would make Daniel in his 40s, which is quite old to take the throne.

==== Charles Martel (714–741) ====

===== Rise to power =====
Following their victory, the Neustrians joined with Radbod, King of the Frisians and invaded Austrasia, aiming towards the Meuse river to take the heartland of the faction&#x27;s support. It is at this moment that Charles Martel is first mentioned in historical records, which note him surviving imprisonment by his step-mother, Plectrude. Charles managed to escape and mustered an Austrasian army to face the encroaching Radbod and the Neustrians. In 716, Charles finally met the Frisians as they approached and, although the &quot;AMP&quot; attempts equalize the losses, it is confirmed from the descriptions in the &quot;LHF&quot; and the &quot;Continuations&quot; that Charles was defeated with heavy losses. Chilperic, Raganfred and, according to the &quot;Continuations&quot;, Radbod, then travelled from Neustria through the forest of the Ardennes and raided around the river Rhine and Cologne, taking treasure from Plectrude and her supporters. As they returned, Charles ambushed the returning party at the Battle of Amblève and was victorious, inflicting heavy losses on the Neustrian invaders.

In 717, Charles mustered his army again and marched on Neustria, taking the city of Verdun during his conquest. He met Chilperic and Raganfred again at the Battle of Vinchy on 21 March 717 and was once again victorious, forcing them back to Paris. He then swiftly returned to Austrasia and besieged Cologne, defeating Plectrude and reclaiming his father&#x27;s wealth and treasure. Charles bolstered his position by installing the Merovingian king Chlothar IV in Austrasia as an opposing Merovingian to Chilperic II. Despite not having a Merovingian king for around 40 years in Austrasia, Charles&#x27; position was clearly weak at this time and he required the support of the established Merovingians to gather military support. Despite his weaknesses, Charles&#x27; recent success had made him a greater political entity; as such, Chilperic and Raganfred could not win a decisive victory against him. So, in 718 they too sent embassies and won the support of Duke Eudo of Aquitaine who, at their request, mustered &#x27;a Gascon army&#x27; to face Charles. In response, Charles brought an army to the eastern Neustrian borders and faced Duke Eudo in battle at Soissons. Duke Eudo, realising he was outmatched, retreated to Paris, where he took Chilperic and the royal treasury and left for Aquitaine. Charles pursued them, according to the &quot;Continuations&quot;, as far as Orleans, but Eudo and the Neustrians managed to escape. In 718, King Chlothar IV died and was not replaced; instead, Charles became the primary authority in Francia. He established a peace treaty with Duke Eudo that ensured Chilperic II was returned to Francia; thereafter, until Chilperic&#x27;s death in 720 at Noyon, the kingship was restored with Carolingian control and Charles became the &quot;maior palatii&quot; in both Neustria and Austrasia. Following Chilperic II&#x27;s death, the Merovingian king Theuderic IV, son of Dagobert III, was taken from Chelles Abbey and appointed by the Neustrians and Charles as the Frankish king.

===== Consolidation of power =====
With his ascension to the throne, several significant moments in Frankish history occurred. Firstly, the &quot;LHF&quot; ended, likely composed several years later in 727 and ended one of the several perspectives we have on Charles&#x27; ascension. Secondly, and more importantly, the Arnulfing predominance in the faction ended and the Carolingian (translating to &#x27;sons of Charles&#x27;) officially began.

Once the immediate dangers were dealt with, Charles then began to consolidate his position as sole mayor of the Frankish kingdom. The civil unrest between 714 and 721 had destroyed the continental political cohesion, and peripheral kingdoms like Aquitaine, Alemannia, Burgundy and Bavaria had slipped from the Carolingian&#x27;s grasp. Even though the faction had, by Charles Martel&#x27;s time, established strong political control over Francia, loyalty to the Merovingian power within these border regions remained.

====== Ending the Civil War ======
Charles first set out to reinstate Carolingian dominance internally within Francia: the &quot;Continuations&quot; lists Charles&#x27; continuous maneuvers which solidified the campaigns generating the Carolingian military foundation. In 718, the &quot;AMP&quot; records that Charles fought against the Saxons, pushing them as far as the river Weser and following up with subsequent campaigns in 720 and 724 which secured the northern borders of Austrasia and Neustria. He subdued his former enemy Raganfred at Angers in 724 and secured his patronage, removing the remaining political resistance that had continued to thrive in western Neustria.

====== East of the Rhine ======
In 725, Charles set out against the peripheral kingdoms, starting with Alemannia. The region had almost gained independence during the reign of Pippin II and under the leadership of Lantfrid, Duke of Alemannia, as (710–730) they acted without Frankish authority, issuing law codes like the &quot;Lex Alamannorum&quot; without Carolingian consultation. As recorded in the Alemannia source, the &quot;Breviary of Erchanbert&quot;, the Alemanni &#x27;refused to obey the duces of the Franks because they were no longer able to serve the Merovingian kings. Therefore, each of them kept to himself.&#x27; This statement was true for more than just Alemannia and, just like in those regions, Charles brutally forced them into submission. Charles was successful in his first campaign, but returned in 730, the same year that Duke Lantfrid died and was succeeded by his brother Theudebald, Duke of Alamannia.

As successful as campaigning had been, Charles seemingly took inspiration from Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface, who in 719 was sent by Pope Gregory II to convert Germany, in particular the areas of Thuringia and Hesse, where he established the monasteries of Ohrdruf, Tauberbischofsheim, Kitzingen and Ochsenfurt. Charles, realising the potential of establishing Carolingian-supportive episcopal centres, utilised Saint Pirmin, an itinerant monk, to establish an ecclesiastical foundation on Reichenau Island in Lake Constance. He was expelled in 727 by Lantfrid and he retreated to Alsace, where he established monasteries with the support of the Etichonid clan, who were Carolingian supporters. This relationship gave the Carolingians long-term benefit from Pirmin&#x27;s future achievements, which brought abbeys in the eastern provinces into Carolingian favour.

In 725, Charles continued his conquest from Alemannia and invaded Bavaria. Like Alemannia, Bavaria had continued to gain independence under the rule of the Agilolfings clan who, in recent years, had increased links with Lombardy and affirmed their own law codes, like the Lex Baiuvariorum. When Charles moved, the region was experiencing a power struggle between Grimoald of Bavaria and his nephew Hugbert, but when Grimoald died in 725, Hugbert gained the position and Charles reaffirmed their support. The &quot;Continuations&quot; records that when Charles left Bavaria, he took hostages, one of which was Swanachild, who later would become Charles&#x27; second wife. Paul Fouracre believes this marriage could have been intentionally forced, based upon the fact that Swanchild&#x27;s heritage related her both to Alemannia and Bavaria. Not only would their marriage have allowed greater control over both regions, but it also would have cut the existing family ties that the Agilofings had to the Pippinid family branch. Plectrude&#x27;s sister Regintrud was married to Theodo of Bavaria, and this relation provided an opportunity for disenfranchised family members to defect.

====== Aquitaine, Burgundy and Provence ======
Following his conquest east of the Rhine, Charles had the opportunity to assert his dominance over Aquitaine and began committing military resources and performing raids in 731. However, before he could make any major movements, Aquitaine was invaded by Umayyad warlord Abd al-Rahman I. Following Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s ascension in Spain in 731, another local Berber lord Munuza revolted, set himself up at Cerdanya and forged defensive alliances with the Franks and Aquitainians through a marriage to Eudo&#x27;s daughter. Abd ar-Rahman then besieged Cerdanya and forced Munuza into retreat into France, at which point he continued his advance into Aquitaine, moving as far as Tours before he was met by Charles Martel. Carolingian sources attest that Duke Eudo begged Charles for assistance, but Ian N. Wood claims these embassies have been invented by later pro-Carolingian annalists. Eudo was a main protagonist in the Battle of Toulouse (721), which famously stopped Muslim lord Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani&#x27;s advances in Narbonne and gained Eudo praise in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;.

Charles met the Muslim force at the famous Battle of Poitiers (732) and came out victorious, killing Abd ar-Rahman. This moment cemented Charles Martel in historical records and gained him international praise. Bede, writing at the same time in Jarrow, England, recorded the event in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, and his victory gained Charles Martel the admiration of seminal historian Edward Gibbon who considered him the Christian saviour of Europe. Although his victory was considered famous, in reality his victory was far less impactful, and Charles would not gain much control in Aquitaine until Eudo&#x27;s death in 735. The victory may have given the Carolingians relative local support that potentially allowed Charles to assert dominance over Eudo&#x27;s son and successor Hunald of Aquitaine, but records of continued hostilities in 736 only further cemented that relations were strained.

With a stronger establishment in Aquitaine, Charles made moves to assert his dominance into Burgundy. The region, at least in the Northern areas, had remained controlled and allied with Frankish interest. Influential nobility like Savaric of Auxerre, who had maintained near-autonomy and led military forces against Burgundian towns like Orléans, Nevers and Troyes, even dying whilst besieging Lyon, were the key to Charles&#x27; support. As such, Charles made multiple attempts to both gain the faction&#x27;s support and remove their authority. When Savaric died during Charles&#x27; early reign, he agreed to support Savaric&#x27;s nephew Bishop Eucherius of Orléans&#x27; claim to the bishopric. However, once Charles had established a powerful basis by 737, he exiled Eucherius, with the help of a man called Chrodobert, to the monastery of St Trond. Charles took further military action in the same year to fully assert his authority, and installed his sons Pippin and Remigius as magnates. This was followed by the installation of political supporters from Bavaria and local supporters like Theuderic of Autun and Adalhard of Chalon.

This acquisition of land in southern France was supported by the increased social chaos that seemingly developed during the Civil War years. This was most apparent in Provence, where local magnates, like Abbo of Provence, were incredibly supportive of Charles&#x27; attempts to reinstate Frankish power. In 739, he used his power in Burgundy and Aquitaine to lead an attack with his brother Childebrand I against Arab invaders and Duke Maurontus, who had been claiming independence and allying himself with Muslim emir Abd ar-Rahman. It is likely due to Childebrand&#x27;s sponsorship of the manuscript that his involvement is so extensively recorded in the &quot;Continuations&quot;. According to the manuscript, Childebrand and Charles noticed the Arab army, with Maurontus&#x27; welcome, entering Avignon and quickly moved against the alliance. They besieged the city and claimed victory; the Franks then made the decision to invade Septimania, taking Narbonne and flanking the Arab army. The Franks then fought off a support army sent from Spain under Omar-ibn Chaled at the River Berre. From there the Franks then pursued the retreating Arabs and ravaged the cities of Nîmes, Agde and Béziers before returning to Francia. Later that year, Charles and Childebrand returned to Provence, likely collecting more forces, and then forcing the rebellious Maurontus into &#x27;impenetrable rocky fastnesses out to sea.&#x27; Paul the Deacon later records in his &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; Maurontus received help from the Lombards, and his Arab allies then fled. At this time, Charles then assumed control of the region and, judging from Charter evidence, appointed Abbo of Provence as &quot;patricius&quot; (Patrician) in the region.

===== Ruling Francia =====
Charles also ruled the Frankish realm, although the majority of his policies were centred upon his conquests and his military ventures. In 19th century historiography, historians like Heinrich Brunner even centred their arguments around Charles&#x27; necessity for military resources, in particular the development of mounted warrior or cavalry that would peak in the High Middle Ages. However, in modern historiography, historians like Pierre Riche and Paul Fouracre have discredited his ideas as too simplistic and have aimed to depict more realistic fragments of development that may or not have been interdependent. This was the period in which the Carolingians first began to establish themselves as fully independent from the Merovingian royalty.

====== Vassalage and Church ======
Charles Martel has become notorious in historiography for his role in the development of the concept of feudalism. The debates are rooted in the arguments of historians like François-Louis Ganshof, who viewed Charles&#x27; reign as the birth of the &#x27;feudal&#x27; relationship between power and property. This results from the increased use of &quot;precaria&quot; or temporary land grants by the Carolingians, who allocated and spread their power to their subordinates. Ganshof&#x27;s arguments connect these ties to a military-tenure relationship; however, this is never represented in primary material, and instead is only implied, and likely derived from, an understanding of &#x27;feudalism&#x27; in the High Middle Ages. Recent historians like Paul Fouracre have criticised Ganshof&#x27;s review for being too simplistic, and in reality, even though these systems of vassalage did exist between lord and populace, they were not as standardised as older historiography has suggested. For example, Fouracre has drawn particular attention to the incentives that drew lords and warriors into the Carolingian armies, arguing that the primary draw was &#x27;booty&#x27; and treasure gained from conquest rather than &#x27;feudal&#x27; obligation.

Although Charles&#x27; reign is no longer considered transitional in its feudal developments, it is seen as a transitional period in the spread of the existing system of vassals and &quot;precaria&quot; land rights. Due to Charles&#x27; continued military and missionary work, the political systems that existed in the heartlands, Austrasia and Neustria, officially began to spread to the periphery. Those whom Charles appointed as new nobility in these regions, often with lifetime tenures, ensured that Carolingian loyalties and systems was maintained across the kingdoms. The Carolingians were also far more strict with their land rights and tenure than their Merovingian predecessors, carefully distributing their new land to new families temporarily, but maintaining their control. Merovingians kings weakened themselves by allocating too much of their royal domains to supporting factions; the Carolingians themselves seemingly became increasingly powerful due to their generosity. By giving away their land, the Merovingians allowed themselves to become figureheads and the &#x27;do nothing kings&#x27; that Einhard prefaced in the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;.

Due to his vast military conquests, Charles often reallocated existing land settlements, including Church property, to new tenants. Ecclesiastical property and monasteries in the late Merovingian and Carolingian period were political centres and often closely related to the royal court; as such they often became involved in political matters, which often overlapped with Charles&#x27; reallocation of land. This &#x27;secularisation&#x27; of Church property caused serious tension between the Carolingian church and state, and often gave Charles a negative depiction in ecclastical sources. The reallocation of church land was not new by Charles&#x27; reign; Ian Wood has managed to identify the practice going back to the reigns of Dagobert I (629–639) and Clovis II (639–657). The majority of the sources that depict Charles&#x27; involvement in Church land rights come from the 9th century, and are therefore less reliable, but two supposedly contemporary sources also identify this issue. The first, a letter sent by missionary Saint Boniface to Anglo-Saxon king Æthelbald of Mercia, called Charles&#x27; a &#x27;destroyer of many monasteries, and embezzler of Church revenues for his own use...&#x27;, condemning him for his use of Church property. This is supported by the second source, the &quot;Contintuations&quot;, which related that, in 733 in Burgundy, Charles split the Lyonnais between his followers, this likely including Church land. Further chronicles like the &quot;Gesta episcoporum Autissiodorensium&quot; and the &quot;Gesta Sanctorum Patrum Fontanellensis Coenobii&quot; recorded monasteries losing substantial land. The monastery at Auxerre was reduced to a hundred &quot;mansus&quot; by Pippin III&#x27;s reign, and at the Abbey of Saint Wandrille under Abbot Teutsind, who was appointed by Charles in 735/6, the Church&#x27;s local property was reduced to a third its size. Wood has also criticised this point and proven that the loss of land by the Church was in reality very small, the remaining land being simply leased as it went beyond the Church&#x27;s capabilities. Regardless, it is apparent that Charles&#x27; expansion of control consumed plenty of reallocated properties, many of which were ecclesiastical domains.

=====Interregnum, death and divisions=====
When King Theuderic IV died in 737, Charles did not install a Merovingian successor. Unlike his Carolingian predecessors, Charles was clearly strong enough by the end of his reign to not rely on Merovingian loyalties. He had created his own power bloc through the vassals he installed in Frankish heartlands and peripheral states. Even prior to Theuderic&#x27;s death, Charles did act with complete sovereignty in Austrasia. It was only in areas like Neustria, where Carolingian opposition historically existed, that Charles knew he would face criticism if he usurped the throne.

Therefore, until his death, Charles ruled as &quot;Princeps&quot; or First Man/First Citizen, officially gaining the title with his uncontested leadership with the acquisition of Provence in 737. This meant that the issue of kingship remained ever present for his successors who would have to work further to establish themselves as royal.

When Charles died in 741, he was buried at St Denis in Paris. He made secure succession plans, likely learning from his father, that ensured Francia was effectively divided between his sons, Carloman and Pippin as &quot;maior palatii&quot;. According to the &quot;Continuations&quot;, the eldest son, Carloman, was given control of the eastern kingdoms in Austrasia, Alammania and Thuringia, while Pippin was given the western kingdoms in Burgundy, Neustria and Provence.

==== Charlemagne ====

The greatest Carolingian monarch was Charlemagne, Pepin&#x27;s son. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III at Rome in 800. His empire, ostensibly a continuation of the Western Roman Empire, is referred to historiographically as the Carolingian Empire.

The Carolingian rulers did not give up the traditional Frankish (and Merovingian) practice of dividing inheritances among heirs, though the concept of the indivisibility of the Empire was also accepted. The Carolingians had the practice of making their sons minor kings in the various regions (&quot;regna&quot;) of the Empire, which they would inherit on the death of their father, which Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious both did for their sons. Following the death of the Emperor Louis the Pious in 840, his surviving adult sons, Lothair I and Louis the German, along with their adolescent brother Charles the Bald, fought a three-year civil war ending only with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the empire into three &quot;regna&quot; while according imperial status and a nominal lordship to Lothair who, at 48, was the eldest. The Carolingians differed markedly from the Merovingians in that they disallowed inheritance to illegitimate offspring, possibly in an effort to prevent infighting among heirs and assure a limit to the division of the realm. In the late ninth century, however, the lack of suitable adults among the Carolingians necessitated the rise of Arnulf of Carinthia as the king of East Francia, a bastard child of a legitimate Carolingian king, Carloman of Bavaria, himself a son of the First King of the Eastern division of the Frankish kingdom, Louis the German.

===Decline===
It was after Charlemagne&#x27;s death that the dynasty began slowly to crumble. His kingdom was split into three parts, each being ruled over by one of his grandsons. Only the kingdoms of the eastern and western portions survived, becoming the predecessors of modern Germany and France. The Carolingians were displaced in most of the &quot;regna&quot; of the Empire by 888. They ruled in East Francia until 911 and held the throne of West Francia intermittently until 987. Carolingian cadet branches continued to rule in Vermandois and Lower Lorraine after the last king died in 987, but they never sought the royal or imperial thrones and made peace with the new ruling families. One chronicler of Sens dates the end of Carolingian rule with the coronation of Robert II of France as junior co-ruler with his father, Hugh Capet, thus beginning the Capetian dynasty.
==Genealogy==











== Grand strategy ==
The historian Bernard Bachrach argues that the rise of the Carolingians to power is best understood using the theory of a Carolingian grand strategy. A grand strategy is a long term military and political strategy that lasts for longer than a typical campaigning season, and can span long periods of time. The Carolingians followed a set course of action that discounts the idea of a random rise in power and can be considered as a grand strategy. Another major part of the grand strategy of the early Carolingians encompassed their political alliance with the aristocracy. This political relationship gave the Carolingians authority and power in the Frankish kingdom.

Beginning with Pippin II, the Carolingians set out to put the (&quot;kingdom of the Franks&quot;) back together, after its fragmentation after the death of Dagobert I, a Merovingian king. After an early failed attempt in to usurp the throne from the Merovingians, the early Carolingians began to slowly gain power and influence as they consolidated military power as mayors of the palace. In order to do this, the Carolingians used a combination of Late Roman military organization along with the incremental changes that occurred between the fifth and eighth centuries. Because of the defensive strategy the Romans had implemented during the Late Empire, the population had become militarized and were thus available for military use. The existence of the remaining Roman infrastructure that could be used for military purposes, such as roads, strongholds and fortified cities meant that the reformed strategies of the Late Romans would still be relevant. Civilian men who lived either in or near a walled city or strong point were required to learn how to fight and defend the areas in which they lived. These men were rarely used in the course of Carolingian grand strategy because they were used for defensive purposes, and the Carolingians were for the most part on the offensive most of the time.

Another class of civilians were required to serve in the military which included going on campaigns. Depending on one&#x27;s wealth, one would be required to render different sorts of service, and &quot;the richer the man was, the greater was his military obligation for service&quot;. For example, if rich, one might be required as a knight. Or one might be required to provide a number of fighting men.

In addition to those who owed military service for the lands they had, there were also professional soldiers who fought for the Carolingians. If the holder of a certain amount of land was ineligible for military service (women, old men, sickly men or cowards) they would still owe military service. Instead of going themselves, they would hire a soldier to fight in their place. Institutions, such as monasteries or churches were also required to send soldiers to fight based on the wealth and the amount of lands they held. In fact, the use of ecclesiastical institutions for their resources for the military was a tradition that the Carolingians continued and greatly benefitted from.

It was &quot;highly unlikely that armies of many more than a hundred thousand effectives with their support systems could be supplied in the field in a single theatre of operation.&quot; Because of this, each landholder would not be required to mobilize all of his men each year for the campaigning season, but instead, the Carolingians would decide which kinds of troops were needed from each landholder, and what they should bring with them. In some cases, sending men to fight could be substituted for different types of war machines. In order to send effective fighting men, many institutions would have well trained soldiers that were skilled in fighting as heavily armored troops. These men would be trained, armored, and given the things they needed in order to fight as heavy troops at the expense of the household or institution for whom they fought. These armed retinues served almost as private armies, &quot;which were supported at the expense of the great magnates, [and] were of considerable importance to early Carolingian military organization and warfare.&quot; The Carolingians themselves supported their own military household and they were the most important &quot;core of the standing army in the&quot; .

It was by utilizing the organization of the military in an effective manner that contributed to the success of the Carolingians in their grand strategy. This strategy consisted of strictly adhering to the reconstruction of the regnum Francorum under their authority. Bernard Bachrach gives three principles for Carolingian long-term strategy that spanned generations of Carolingian rulers: The first principle… was to move cautiously outward from the Carolingian base in Austrasia. Its second principle was to engage in a single region at a time until the conquest had been accomplished. The third principle was to avoid becoming involved beyond the frontiers of the regnum Francorum or to do so when absolutely necessary and then not for the purpose of conquest&quot;.

This is important to the development of medieval history because without such a military organization and without a grand strategy, the Carolingians would not have successfully become kings of the Franks, as legitimized by the bishop of Rome. Furthermore, it was ultimately because of their efforts and infrastructure that Charlemagne was able to become such a powerful king and be crowned Emperor of the Romans in 800. Without the efforts of his predecessors, he would not have been as successful as he was and the revival of the Roman Empire in the West was likely to have not occurred.

<text>The Askafroa (), also known as the Danish Askefrue and German Eschenfrau (), is a type of legendary creature in Scandinavian and possibly German folklore, similar to the Greek Hamadryads. The Askafroa is the guardian (tutelary deity) of the ash tree. The Askafroa was thought to be a malicious creature that did much damage, and to appease her, it was necessary to make a sacrifice to her on Ash Wednesday.

The Swedish scholar Hyltén-Cavallius recorded in his ethnographic work &quot;Wärend och Wirdarne&quot; a belief of a female creature living in the ash tree, in Ljunit Hundred. The elders sacrificed to the Askafroa on the morning of Ash Wednesday. Before the sun had risen, they poured water over the roots of the ash tree. While doing this, they said: &quot;Nu offrar jag, så gör du oss ingen skada&quot;, meaning &quot;Now I sacrifice [to you], so that you do us no harm&quot;. Hyltén-Cavallius further writes that they believed that if anyone broke branches or twigs from the ash tree, they would become ill.

<text>Astrild (from Old Norse: &quot;Love-fire&quot;) is a relatively late Nordic name for Amor or Cupid. Astrild probably originated in the writings of the 17th-century Swedish poet Georg Stiernhielm, and has since been used in Nordic poetry, mainly during the Baroque and Rococo eras, such as in Carl Michael Bellman&#x27;s 1790 &quot;Fredman&#x27;s Epistles&quot;. Astrild does not appear in Norse mythology, even though the name was used before Stiernhielm as a synonym for the estrildid finches.

<doc id="87664" wikidata="Q4156555" url="?curid=87664" title="Nine Mothers of Heimdallr">
<text>In Norse mythology, the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr are nine sisters who gave birth to the god Heimdallr. The Nine Mothers of Heimdallr are attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in the poetry of skalds; and possibly also in a poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a book of poetry compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have debated what being &quot;born of nine mothers&quot; implies and have sought to connect the notion to other European folk motifs. Scholars have theorized that Heimdallr&#x27;s Nine Mothers may be identical to the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, who personify waves. In turn, Heimdallr would be born of the sea.

==Attestations==
The Nine Mothers of Heimdallr are mentioned in two books of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;; &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Heimdallr is introduced in chapter 27, where the enthroned figure of High tells the disguised mythical king Gangleri details about the god. Among other details, High says that Heimdallr is the son of nine sisters and, as a reference, provides two lines of the (otherwise now lost) poem &quot;Heimdalargaldr&quot;, in which Heimdallr says that he was born of nine sisters:

:&quot;Offspring of nine mothers am I, of nine sisters am I the son.&quot;

In chapter 16 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason is quoted. The poem refers to Heimdallr as the &quot;son of eight mothers plus one&quot;. Prose following the poem points out that the poem refers to Heimdallr as the son of nine mothers.

The poem &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; (contained within the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, often considered a part of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;) contains three stanza that scholars have frequently theorized as referring to Heimdallr and his nine mothers. According to the stanzas, long ago, a mighty god was born by nine jötunn maidens at the edge of the world. This boy grew strong, nourished by the strength of the earth, the ice-cold sea, and the blood of swine. Names are provided for these nine maidens. For discussion of these names, see &quot;Names&quot; section below (note that the translations below present anglicizations of Old Norse forms). The stanzas in question read as follows:

===Names===
Some of the names of Heimdallr&#x27;s mothers found in &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; appear in a variety of other sources, where they may or may not refer to separate entities:
==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
The names of all nine mothers mentioned above in &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; appear elsewhere as the names of female jötnar (generally in the þulur). Adding to the confusion, Orchard points out, Gjálp and Greip are otherwise mentioned as jötunn maidens who seek to contravene the god Thor from reaching their father, and Járnsaxa is otherwise the mother of Thor&#x27;s son, Magni.

Some scholars have linked the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr with the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán (who personify waves), an identification that would mean that Heimdallr was thus born from the waves of the sea. However, this connection has been questioned on the grounds that the names presented for the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán and the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr (as found in &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot;) do not match. Scholar John Lindow comments that the identification of Heimdallr&#x27;s mothers as Ægir and Rán&#x27;s daughters do, however, match on the grounds that Ægir and Rán&#x27;s daughters, like Heimdallr&#x27;s mothers, are sisters, and that two separate traditions about Heimdallr&#x27;s mothers may explain the differences between the two.

<doc id="87667" wikidata="Q214081" url="?curid=87667" title="Ymir">
<text>In Norse mythology, Ymir (), also called Aurgelmir, Brimir, or Bláinn, is the ancestor of all jötnar. Ymir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in the poetry of skalds. Taken together, several stanzas from four poems collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; refer to Ymir as a primeval being who was born from atter (), yeasty venom that dripped from the icy rivers called the Élivágar, and lived in the grassless void of Ginnungagap. Ymir gave birth to a male and female from his armpits, and his legs together begat a six-headed being. The grandsons of Búri, the gods Odin, Vili and Vé, fashioned the Earth (elsewhere personified as a goddess, Jörð) from his flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the mountains, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard. In addition, one stanza relates that the dwarfs were given life by the gods from Ymir&#x27;s flesh and blood (or the Earth and sea).

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, a narrative is provided that draws from, adds to, and differs from the accounts in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, after Ymir was formed from the elemental drops, so too was Auðumbla, a primeval cow, whose milk Ymir fed from. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; also states that three gods killed Ymir; the brothers Odin, Vili and Vé, and details that, upon Ymir&#x27;s death, his blood caused an immense flood. Scholars have debated as to what extent Snorri&#x27;s account of Ymir is an attempt to synthesize a coherent narrative for the purpose of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and to what extent Snorri drew from traditional material outside of the corpus that he cites. By way of historical linguistics and comparative mythology, scholars have linked Ymir to Tuisto, the Proto-Germanic being attested by Tacitus in his 1st century CE ethnography &quot;Germania&quot; and have identified Ymir as an echo of a primordial being reconstructed in Proto-Indo-European mythology.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Ymir is mentioned in four poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;; &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, and &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, in which an undead völva imparts knowledge in the god Odin, references are twice made to Ymir. In the first instance, the third stanza of the poem, Ymir is mentioned by name:

In the above translations the name of the location Ginnungagap is translated as &quot;chaotic chasm&quot; (Thorpe, 1866) and &quot;yawning gap&quot; (Bellows). Later in the poem, a few other references are apparently made to Ymir as &quot;Brimir&quot; and &quot;Bláinn&quot; (here anglicized as &quot;Blain&quot;):

In this stanza Thorpe has treated &quot;Brimir&quot; (Old Norse &quot;the bloody moisture&quot;) and &quot;Blain&quot; (Old Norse, disputed) as common nouns. Brimir and Blain are usually held to be proper names that refer to Ymir, as in Bellows&#x27;s translation.

In the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the (disguised) god Odin engages the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a game of wits. Odin asks Vafþrúðnir to tell him, if Vafþrúðnir&#x27;s knowledge is sufficient, the answer to a variety of questions. In the first of which that refers to Ymir, Odin asks from where first came the Earth and the sky. The jötunn responds with a creation account involving Ymir:

As the verbal battle continues, a few more exchanges directly refer to or may allude to Ymir. Odin asks what ancient jötun is the eldest of &quot;Ymir&#x27;s kin&quot;, and Vafþrúðnir responds that long, long ago it was Bergelmir, who was Þrúðgelmir&#x27;s son and Aurgelmir&#x27;s grandson. In the next stanza Odin asks where Aurgelmir came from so long ago, to which Vafþrúðnir responds that venom dropped from Élivágar, and that these drops grew until they became a jötunn, and from this being descends the jötnar. Finally, Odin asks how this being begat children, as he did not know the company of a female jötunn, to which Vafþrúðnir responds that from beneath the ancient jötunn&#x27;s armpits together a girl and a boy grew, and his feet together produced a six-headed jötunn.
In the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) imparts in the young Agnarr cosmological knowledge. In one stanza, Odin mentions Ymir as he recalls the fashioning of the world from his body:

In a stanza of &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; (found in the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;), Ymir receives one more mention. According to the stanza, völvas are descended from Viðòlfr, all seers from Vilmeiðr, all charm-workers from Svarthöfði, and all jötnar descend from Ymir.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Ymir is mentioned in two books of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;; &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. In the first mention, in chapter 5 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High, Just-As-High, and Third tell Gangleri (the disguised mythical king Gylfi) about how all things came to be. The trio explain that the first world to exist was Muspell, a glowing, fiery southern region consisting of flames, uninhabitable by non-natives. After &quot;many ages&quot; Niflheimr was made, and within it lies a spring, Hvergelmir, from which eleven rivers flow.

Gangleri asks the three what things were like before mankind. High continues that these icy rivers, which are called Élivágar, ran so far from their spring source that the poisonous matter that flows with them became hard &quot;like the clinker that comes from a furnace&quot; – it turned to ice. And so, when this ice came to a halt and stopped flowing, the vapor that rose up from the poison went in the same direction and froze to rime. This rime increased, layer upon layer, across Ginnungagap.

Just-As-High adds that the northern part of Ginnungagap was heavy with ice and rime, and vapor and blowing came inward from this. Yet the southern part of Ginunngagap was clear on account of the sparks and molten flecks flying from Muspell. Third assesses that &quot;just as from Niflheim there was coldness and all things grim, so what was facing close to Muspell was hot and bright, but Ginunngagap was as mild as a windless sky&quot;. Third adds that when the rime and hot air met, it thawed and dripped, and the liquid intensely dropped. This liquid fell into the shape of a man, and so he was named &quot;Ymir&quot; and known among the jötnar as &quot;Aurgelmir&quot;, all of which descend from him. In support of these two names, Third quotes a stanza each from &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; and &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;.

Gangleri asks how generations grew from Ymir, how other beings came into existence, and if Ymir was considered a god. High says that Ymir was no god, and &quot;he was evil and all his descendants.&quot; High explains that Ymir is the ancestor of all jötnar (specifically hrimthursar) and that when Ymir slept, he sweated, and from his left and right arm grew a male and a female, and his left leg produced a son with his right leg, and from them came generations.

Gangleri asks where Ymir lived and what sustained him. High explains that the drips next produced a cow named Auðumbla. From her teats flowed four rivers of milk, and from it fed Ymir. Gangleri asks what the cow fed from, and High responds that the cow licked salty rime-stones. The first day Auðumbla licked the rime stones it uncovered that evening the hair of a man. The second day it uncovered his head. The third day a man was uncovered from the ice. This man was named Búri, and was large, powerful, and beautiful to behold. Búri had a son, Borr, who married a jötunn, Bestla, the daughter of Bölþorn. The two had three sons: Odin, Vili, and Vé. High adds that &quot;Odin and his brothers must be the rulers of heaven and earth; it is our opinion that this must be what he is called. This is the name of one who is the greatest and most glorious that we know, and you would well to agree to call him that too&quot;.

High relates that Odin, Vili, and Vé killed Ymir, and his body produced so much blood from his wounds that within it drowned all the jötnar but two, Bergelmir, who, on a &quot;lúðr&quot; with his (unnamed) wife, survived and repopulated the jötnar.

Gangleri asks what, if High, Just-As-High, and Third believe the trio to be gods, what the three did then. High says that the trio took the body into the middle of Ginnungagap and from his flesh fashioned the Earth, from his blood the sea and lakes, from his bones rocks, scree and stones his teeth, molars, and bones. Just-As-High adds that from his gushing wounds they created the sea that surrounds the Earth. Third says that the trio took his skull and placed it above the Earth and from it made the sky. They placed the sky above the earth, and, to hold up the sky, they placed four dwarfs – Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri – at its four corners. The trio took the molten particles and sparks that flew from Muspell and &quot;they fixed all the lights, some in the sky, some moved in a wandering course beneath the sky, but they appointed them positions and ordained their courses&quot;. Third cites a stanza from &quot;Völuspá&quot; in support, stating that by ways of these sky lights days and years were reckoned and counted, and that the stanza reflects that the cosmological bodies did not know their places prior to the creation of earth.

Gangleri comments that what he has just heard is remarkable, as the construction is both immense and made with great skill, and asks how the earth was arranged. High replies that the world is circular, and around it lies the depths of the sea. Along the shore the gods gave land to the jötnar. However, on the inner side on earth they made a fortification against the hostility of the jötnar out of Ymir&#x27;s eyelashes. This fortification they called Midgard. Further, they took Ymir&#x27;s brains and threw them skyward, and from them made clouds. Another two stanzas from &quot;Völuspá&quot; are cited in support.

Later in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; High explains the origin of the dwarfs. High says that after Asgard had been built, the gods assembled on their thrones and held their things. There they &quot;discussed where the dwarfs had been generated from in the soil and down in the earth like maggots in flesh. The dwarfs had taken shape first and acquired life in the flesh of Ymir and were then maggots, but by decision of the gods they became conscious with intelligence and had the shape of men though they live in the earth and in rocks&quot;. Stanzas from &quot;Völuspá&quot; consisting of dwarf names are then provided to show the lineage of the dwarfs.

In the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; poetic means of referring to the sky are provided, some of which relate to the narrative in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; involving Ymir, including &quot;Ymir&#x27;s skull&quot; and &quot;jötunn&#x27;s skull&quot;, or &quot;burden of the dwarfs&quot; or &quot;helmet of Vestri and Austri, Sudri, Nordri&quot;. A portion of a work by the 11th century skald Arnórr jarlaskáld is also provided, which refers to the sky as &quot;Ymir&#x27;s old skull&quot;. Later in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; poetic terms for the earth are provided, including &quot;Ymir&#x27;s flesh&quot;, followed by a section for poetic terms for &quot;sea&quot;, which provides a portion of a work by the skald Ormr Barreyjarskáld where the sea is referred to as &quot;Ymir&#x27;s blood&quot;. Both the names &quot;Aurgelmir&quot; and &quot;Ymir&quot; appear in a list of jötnar in the Nafnaþulur section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

==Reception==
===Lost sources===
As &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; presents a cohesive narrative that both quotes stanzas from various poems found in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; (as outlined above) as well as contains unique information without a provided source (such as Auðumbla); scholars have debated to what extent Snorri had access to outside sources that no longer survive and to what extent he synthesized a narrative from the material he had access to.

Regarding the situation, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that &quot;at the beginning, according to Snorri&#x27;s text of the poem, there was nothing but a void, although according to other texts, the giant Ymir existed already then. Considering how Ymir (Aurgelmir) was said to have taken shape, both Snorri and the &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, we may think that Snorri followed the better version of Vǫluspá&quot; and, regarding Snorri&#x27;s account of the cosmogenesis in general, that &quot;from these sketches of the poetic sources from which he chiefly drew it is obvious that Snorri described several incidents which cannot be traced to them, at least in their extant forms&quot;. Turville-Petre cites Snorri&#x27;s account of Auðumbla as a prime example, noting Indo-European parallels (Persian and Vedic) and an Egyptian parallel in the Egyptian goddess Hathor.

H.R.E. Davidson (1964) comments that &quot;the original form of the creation myth in the north is not easy to determine. Snorri knew of at least three separate accounts&quot;.

===Tuisto, parallels, and Proto-Indo-European religion===
In the 1st century CE, Roman historian Tacitus writes in his ethnography &quot;Germania&quot; that the Germanic peoples sang songs about a primeval god who was born of the Earth named &quot;Tuisto&quot;, and that he was the progenitor of the Germanic peoples. &quot;Tuisto&quot; is the Latinized form of a Proto-Germanic theonym that is a matter of some debate. By way of historical linguistics some scholars have linked &quot;Tuisto&quot; to the Proto-Germanic theonym *&quot;Tiwaz&quot;, while other scholars argue that the name refers to a &quot;two-fold&quot; or hermaphroditic being (compare Old Swedish &quot;tvistra&quot;, meaning &quot;separate&quot;). The latter etymology has led scholars to a connection to Ymir on both linguistic and mythographic grounds.

By way of historical linguistics and comparative mythology, scholars have linked Ymir to other primordial, sometimes hermaphroditic or twin beings in other Indo-European mythologies and have reconstructed elements of a Proto-Indo-European cosmological dissection. Citing Ymir as a prime example, scholars D.Q. Adams and J.P. Mallory comment that &quot;the [Proto-Indo-European] cosmogonic myth is centered on the dismemberment of a divine being – either anthropomorphic or bovine – and the creation of the universe out of its various elements&quot;. Further examples cited include the climactic ending of the Old Irish &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; where a bull is dissected that makes up the Irish geography, and apparently Christianized forms of the myth found in the Old Russian &quot;Poem of the Dove Book&quot; (Голубиная книга), the Frisian &quot;Frisian Code of Emsig&quot;, and Irish Other examples given include Ovid&#x27;s 1st century BCE to 1st century BCE Latin &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; description of the god Atlas&#x27;s beard and hair becoming forests, his bones becoming stone, his hands mountain ridges, and so forth; the 9th century AD Middle Persian &quot;Škend Gumānīg Wizār&quot;, wherein the malevolent being Kūnī&#x27;s skin becomes the sky, from his flesh comes the earth, his bones the mountains, and from his hair comes plants; and the 10th century BCE Old Indic &quot;Purusha sukta&quot; from the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, which describes how the primeval man Purusha was dissected; from his eye comes the sun, from his mouth fire, from his breath wind, from his feet the earth, and so on. Among surviving sources, Adams and Mallory summarize that &quot;the most frequent correlations, or better, derivations, are the following: Flesh = Earth, Bone = Stone, Blood = Water (the sea, etc.), Eyes = Sun, Mind = Moon, Brain = Cloud, Head = Heaven, Breath = Wind&quot;.

Adams and Mallory write that &quot;In both cosmogonic myth and the foundation element of it, one of the central aspects is the notion of sacrifice (of a brother, giant, bovine, etc.). The relationship between sacrifice and cosmogony was not solely that of a primordial event but the entire act of sacrifice among the Indo-Europeans might be seen as a re-creation of the universe where elements were being continuously recycled. ... Sacrifice thus represents a creative re-enactment of the initial cosmic dismemberment of a victim and it helps return the material stuff to the world&quot;.
===Other===
Davidson further links accounts of the jötunn Þjazi&#x27;s eyes flung into the heavens by Odin and the frozen toe of Aurvandil tossed into the sky by the god Thor, the eyes in the prior case becoming stars and the toe in the latter case becoming a star known as &quot;Aurvandil&#x27;s Toe&quot;. Davidson comments that &quot;these myths are evidently connected with names of constellations, but the strange reference to a frozen toe suggests that there is some connexion with the creation legend of the giant that emerged from the ice&quot;.

<text>In Norse mythology, Auðumbla (; also Auðhumla and Auðumla ) is a primeval cow. The primordial frost jötunn Ymir fed upon her milk, and over the course of three days she licked away the salty rime rocks and revealed Búri, grandfather of the gods and brothers Odin, Vili and Vé. The creature is attested solely in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century by Icelander Snorri Sturluson. Scholars identify her as stemming from a very early stratum of Germanic mythology, and ultimately belonging to larger complex of primordial bovines or cow-associated goddesses.

==Name==
The cow&#x27;s name variously appears in &quot;Prose Edda&quot; manuscripts as &quot;Auðumbla&quot; , &quot;Auðhumla&quot; , and &quot;Auðumla&quot; , and is generally accepted as meaning &#x27;hornless cow rich in milk&#x27; (from Old Norse &quot;auðr&quot; &#x27;riches&#x27; and *&quot;humala&quot; &#x27;hornless&#x27;).

The compound presents some level of semantic ambiguity. A parallel occurs in Scottish English &quot;humble-cow&quot; &#x27;hornless cow&#x27;, and Northern Europeans have bred hornless cows since prehistoric times. As highlighted above, &quot;Auð-&quot; may mean &#x27;rich&#x27; and in turn &#x27;rich hornless cow&#x27; remains generally accepted among scholars as a gloss of the Old Icelandic animal name. However, &quot;auðr&quot; can also mean &#x27;fate&#x27; and &#x27;desolate; desert&#x27;, and so &quot;Auðhum(b)la&quot; may also have been understood as the &#x27;destroyer of the desert&#x27;. This semantic ambiguity may have been intentional.

==Attestations==
Auðumbla&#x27;s sole attested narrative occurs in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and her name appears among ways to refer to cows later in the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of the book. In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Gangleri (described earlier in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; as king Gylfi in disguise) asks where, in the distant past, Ymir lived and what he ate. High says that the cow Auðumbla&#x27;s teats produced four rivers of milk, from which Ymir fed. Gylfi asks what Auðumbla ate, and High says that she licked salty rime stones for sustenance. He recounts that Auðumbla once licked salts for three days, revealing Búri: The first day she licked free his hair, the second day his head, and the third day his entire body.

The second and final mention of Auðumbla occurs in the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot;, wherein the author provides a variety of ways to refer to cows. Auðumbla is the only cow mentioned by name, and the author adds that &quot;she is the noblest of cows&quot;.

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
On the topic of Auðumbla, John Lindow says that cows appear commonly in creation narratives around the world, yet &quot;what is most striking about Audhumla is that she unites the two warring groups in the mythology, by nourishing Ymir, ancestor of all the giants, and bringing into the light Búri, progenitor of the æsir.&quot;

Rudolf Simek highlights that Roman senator Tacitus&#x27;s first century CE work ethnography of the Germanic peoples &quot;Germania&quot; mentions that they maintained hornless cattle (see &quot;name&quot; section above), and notes that the &quot;Germania&quot; relates how an image of the Germanic goddess Nerthus was borne through the countryside in a wagon drawn by cattle. Simek compares the deity to a variety of cow-associated deities among non-Germanic peoples, such as the Egyptian goddess Hathor (depicted as cow-headed) and Isis (whose iconography contains references to cows), and the Ancient Greek Hera (described as &#x27;the cow-eyed&#x27;).

<text>In Norse mythology, Búri (Old Norse: ) is a god and &#x27;producer, father&#x27; of all other gods. An early ancestor of the Æsir gods, the principal pantheon in Old Norse religion. Búri was licked free from salty rime stones by the primeval cow Auðumbla over the course of three days. Búri&#x27;s background beyond this point is unattested and he had a son, Borr, by way of an unknown process. Búri is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century by Icelander Snorri Sturluson. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; includes a quote from a 12th-century poem by skald Þórvaldr Blönduskáld that mentions the figure. Búri&#x27;s mysterious origins are the subject of scholarly commentary and interpretation.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Búri&quot;, like the name of his son &quot;Burr&quot;, is derived from the Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot; &quot;son, born&quot;. Thus, both names basically mean the same thing. In research, Buri&#x27;s name is translated as &quot;begotten, father&quot; and Burr as &quot;begotten, son&quot; - probably because of the generational sequence. However, how he fathered his son is not explained; either by himself or through sexual reproduction.

==Attestations==
Búri receives mention twice in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;—once in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and again in a skaldic poem quoted in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. The &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; section reads as follows:

Búri is mentioned nowhere in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and only once in the skaldic corpus. In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Snorri quotes the following verse by the 12th century skald Þórvaldr blönduskáld:

<doc id="87673" wikidata="Q830622" url="?curid=87673" title="Bestla">
<text>Bestla (Old Norse: ) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, and the mother of the gods Odin, Vili and Vé (by way of Borr). She is also the sister of an unnamed man who assisted Odin, and the daughter (or granddaughter depending on the source) of the jötunn Bölþorn. Odin is frequently called &quot;Bestla&#x27;s son&quot; in both skaldic verses and the Poetic Edda.

Bestla is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the poetry of skalds. Scholars have commented on the obscurity of the figure&#x27;s name and have proposed various theories to explain the role and origin of the giantess.

==Name==
The meaning of the Old Norse name &quot;Bestla&quot; remains uncertain. Scholars have proposed potential meanings such as &#x27;wife&#x27;, or &#x27;bark, bast&#x27;. It might stem from &quot;*Bastilōn&quot; (perhaps a yew goddess, originally a &#x27;bast-donor&#x27;), or from &quot;*Banstillōn&quot; (via an intermediate form &quot;*Böstla&quot;), related to Old Frisian &quot;bös&quot; (&#x27;marriage, union&#x27;, originally &#x27;wife&#x27;).

According to Rudolf Simek, &quot;the name appears to be very old&quot; due to its obscurity.

==Attestations==
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), she is portrayed as the daughter of the giant Bölþorn and as the spouse of Borr, while the enthroned figure of Hárr (High) tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) of the genealogy of the god Odin.
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (The Language of Poetry), a poem by the skald Einarr Helgarson refers to Odin as &quot;Bestla&#x27;s son&quot;.

&quot;Hávamál&quot; makes Bölþor(n) the grandfather of Bestla. Odin recounts his gaining of nine magical songs from Bestla&#x27;s unnamed brother. If nothing indicates a family relationship between Odin and the man in the stanza (although skalds were certainly aware of Bestla as Odin&#x27;s mother), and if the mead was allegedly stolen according to other sources, it is possible that Odin obtained magical songs from his maternal uncle.


==Theories==
On the basis of the &quot;Hávamál&quot; stanza handled above (wherein Odin learns nine magic songs from the unnamed brother of Bestla), some scholars have theorized that Bestla&#x27;s brother may in fact be the wise being Mímir, from whose severed head the god Odin gains wisdom.

Since Odin is descended from the jötnar on his mother&#x27;s side, the slaying of Ymir by him and his brothers could be seen as an intra-familial killing and, according to scholar John Lindow, &quot;the slaying or denial of a maternal relation&quot;.

Waltraud Hunke has argued that Bestla should be regarded as the bark of the world tree on which Odin was perhaps born, alluding to &quot;Hávamál&quot; : &quot;then I started to grow fruitful&quot;.

In his translation of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Henry Adams Bellows comments that such the position of the stanza 140 in &quot;Hávamál&quot; appears to be the result of manuscript interpolation, and that its meaning is obscure.

<text>Bölþorn (also Bölþor; Old Norse: , &quot;Evil-thorn&quot;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, and the father (or grandfather) of Bestla, herself the mother of Odin, Vili and Vé.

The figure receives mention in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, composed in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, compiled by Icelander Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Scholars have noted that the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; mention may mean that he is the father of the wise being Mímir.

==Name==
The name is attested under two variants. &quot;Bölþorn&quot; is used in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), whereas &quot;Bölþor&quot; occurs in &quot;Hávamál&quot; (Sayings of the High One).&quot;&quot; 

The Old Norse name &quot;Bölþorn&quot; has been translated &#x27;Evil-thorn&#x27;.&#x27; The variant form &quot;Bölþor&quot; would have had no clear meaning to medieval Scandinavians.&#x27;

== Attestations ==
In &quot;Hávamál&quot; (Sayings of the High One), Bölþor receives his only mention of the Poetic Edda.

&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi) mentions in the Prose Edda that Bölþorn is a jötunn, and Bestla&#x27;s father.

==Theories==
It is often argued that the figure of Bölþorn embodies a traditional relationship with the maternal uncle, a pattern found in Germanic myths and legends alike. According to Orchard, the Roman historian Tacitus (1st c. AD) &quot;had already noted the importance of that particular family tie in Germanic society, and there are numerous examples of the closeness of male figures with their maternal uncles in the literary sources.&quot; For instance, a medieval Icelandic proverb goes by saying: &quot;Men turn out most like their maternal uncles.&quot; Lindow comments : &quot;Certainly Odin, of all the gods, turned out most like a giant.&quot;

Various scholars have also noted that the unnamed man (Bölþorn&#x27;s son and Bestla&#x27;s brother) in &quot;Hávamál&quot; may be the wise being Mímir.

<doc id="87678" wikidata="Q48777" url="?curid=87678" title="The Waltons">
<text>The Waltons is an American historical drama television series about a family in rural mountainous Western Virginia of the Appalachian Mountains / Allegheny Mountains / Blue Ridge Mountains chain, during the economic hardships and mass unemployment of the era of the Great Depression of the 1930s and subsequent wartime homefront of World War II of the early 1940s. It was created by screenwriter / author Earl Hamner Jr., based on his 1961 book &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; and the 1963 film of the same name. &quot;The Waltons&quot; aired almost a decade later from 1972-81, however relocated from the Spencers family 1963 film portrayal of the geographic site in the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming and late 1950s era to creator Hamner&#x27;s real-life memories and home turf of western Virginia (born and raised near Schuyler, Nelson County) and appropriate time period of the Depression era &#x27;30s and wartime &#x27;40s of fictional village of Walton&#x27;s Mountain, Jefferson County, near the town of Rockfish in Virginia.

The TV film special The Homecoming: A Christmas Story was broadcast on December 19, 1971. Based on its high ratings and critical responses success, the CBS network ordered the first season of episodes (to be based on the same characters, with some changes in the participating cast) which became known in the autumn of the following year as the television series &quot;The Waltons&quot;. Beginning in September 1972, the series was broadcast on the CBS network for nine seasons in total. After the series was canceled ten years later in 1981, three television film reunion sequels aired the following year in 1982 on competing NBC (National Broadcasting Company), with three more in the subsequent decade of the 1990s back on CBS. &quot;The Waltons&quot; was produced by Lorimar Productions and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution in later syndication after 1981.

The show&#x27;s end sequence featured the family saying goodnight to one another before going to bed for the night. According to the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) which broadcast the series overseas in the United Kingdom / British Isles. &quot;Goodnight, John-Boy&quot; was one of the most common catchphrases of the 1970s long run of the show.

==Premise==
===Setting===
The main story is set in Walton&#x27;s Mountain, a fictional mountain community in the fictitious Jefferson County, Virginia. The real place that the stories are based in is Schuyler in Nelson County, Virginia.

The time period is from 1933-1946, during the Great Depression and World War II, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman (who are occasionally mentioned and especially FDR, whose picture hangs in the Walton homestead and neighboring Ike Godsey&#x27;s General Mercantile store). The deepest Depression year of 1933 is suggested by a mentioned reference to the opening of the Century of Progress exposition (World&#x27;s Fair) held in Chicago, a brief shot of an antique automobile registration license plate, and it is divulged in episode 5 that the date is in the spring of 1933. The last episode of season one, &quot;An Easter Story,&quot; is set in February-April 1934. The year 1934 takes two seasons to cover, while some successive years are covered over the course of a few months.

The series finale, &quot;The Revel,&quot; revolves around a party and the invitation date is given as June 4, 1946. A span of 13 years is therefore covered in nine seasons. There are some chronological inconsistencies, most of which do not hinder the storyline. The episode depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor was actually broadcast on December 7th, 1978, (a Thursday that year), which coordinated the memorable month and date on which the attack occurred, but not the day of the week (which was in reality a Sunday early morning), but on which day the series was broadcast.

The first three reunion movies (&quot;A Wedding on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot;, and &quot;A Day for Thanks on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot;), all produced in 1982, and aired several weeks apart are set in the later post-war year of 1947. Of the later reunions TV films, &quot;A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion&quot;, filmed in 1993, is set in 1963, and revolves around President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s November 22nd assassination. &quot;A Walton Wedding&quot;, made two years later in 1995, is set in 1964, and &quot;A Walton Easter&quot;, filmed another two years following in 1997, is set in fictional 1969, with the social / political themes of the turbulent late 1960s intertwined in the updated story of the later generations of the Walton family.

The series began relating stories that occurred 39 years in the past and ended with its last reunion show set 28 years in the past.

A continuity error exists in the final reunion movie about how many years John and wife / mother Olivia are said to be married, counting back to the first episode. In this reunion movie, John and Olivia are celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in 1969, which dates their wedding to 1929. However, in the first episode of the series aired in September 1972, it is supposedly set in 1933 (&quot;The Foundling&quot;), John Boy is 17 years old and he already has six brothers and sisters.

===Story===
The story is about the family of John Walton Jr. (known as John-Boy): his six siblings, his parents John and Olivia Walton, and paternal grandparents Zebulon &quot;Zeb&quot; and Esther Walton. John-Boy is the first of the seven children (15 years old in &quot;The Homecoming&quot;; 17 at the beginning of the series), who becomes a journalist and novelist. Each episode is narrated at the opening and closing by a middle-aged John Jr. (voiced by author Earl Hamner on whom John-Boy is based). John Sr., who quit his city job after the traumatic events in the pilot episode, manages to eke out a living for his family by operating a lumber mill with the help of his sons as they grow older. The family income is augmented by some small-scale farming, and John occasionally hunts to put meat on the table. In the simpler days of their country youth, all of the children are rambunctious and curious, but as times grow tough, the children slowly depart from the innocent, carefree days of walking everywhere barefoot while clad in overalls and hand-sewn pinafores, and into the harsh, demanding world of accountability and responsibility.

The family shares hospitality with relatives and strangers as they are able. The small community named after their property is also home to folk of various income levels, ranging from the well-to-do Baldwin sisters, two spinsters who distill moonshine that they call &quot;Papa&#x27;s recipe;&quot; Ike Godsey, postmaster and owner of the general store with his somewhat snobbish wife Corabeth (a Walton cousin; she calls her husband &quot;Mr. Godsey&quot;); an African-American couple, Verdie and Harley Foster; Maude Gormley, a presumptuous artist who paints on wood; Flossie Brimmer, a friendly though somewhat gossipy widow who runs a nearby boarding house; and Yancy Tucker, a good-hearted handyman with big plans but little motivation. Jefferson County sheriff Ep Bridges, who fought alongside John in World War I and was awarded the Medal of Honor, keeps law and order in Walton&#x27;s Mountain. The entire family (except for John) attends a Baptist church, of which Olivia and Grandma Esther are the most regular attendees.

In the signature scene that closes almost every episode, the family house is enveloped in darkness, save for 1, 2 or 3 lights in the upstairs bedroom windows. Through voice-overs, two or more characters make some brief comments related to that episode&#x27;s events, and then bid each other goodnight, after which the lights go out.

After completing high school, John-Boy attends fictional Boatwright University in the fictional nearby town of Westham. He later goes to New York City to work as a journalist.
During the latter half of the 1976–77 season, Grandma Esther Walton suffers a stroke and returns home shortly before the death of her husband, Grandpa Zeb Walton (reflecting Ellen Corby&#x27;s real-life stroke and the death of Will Geer, the actors who portrayed those characters).

During the series&#x27; last few years, Mary Ellen and Ben start their own families; Erin, Jason and John-Boy are married in later television movie sequels. Younger children Jim-Bob and Elizabeth struggle to find and cement true love.

World War II deeply affects the family. All four Walton boys enlist in the military. Mary Ellen&#x27;s physician husband, Curtis &quot;Curt&quot; Willard, is sent to Pearl Harbor and is reported to have perished in the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. Years later, Mary Ellen hears of sightings of her &quot;late&quot; husband, investigates and finds him alive (played by another actor), but brooding over his war wounds and living under an assumed name. She divorces him and later remarries.

John-Boy&#x27;s military plane is shot down, while Olivia becomes a volunteer at the VA hospital and is seen less and less. She eventually develops tuberculosis and enters an Arizona sanatorium. Olivia&#x27;s cousin, Rose Burton, moves in at the Walton house to look after the family. Two years later, John Sr. moves to Arizona to be with Olivia. Grandma appears in only a handful of episodes during the eighth season. She was usually said to be visiting relatives in nearby Buckingham County. Consistent with the effects of Ellen Corby&#x27;s actual stroke, Grandma rarely speaks during the remainder of the series, usually limited to uttering brief one-or two-word lines such as &quot;No!&quot; or &quot;Oh, boy!&quot;

6 movies were made after the series run. Set from 1947-69, they aired between 1982-97.

==Production==
===Inspiration===
Earl Hamner&#x27;s rural childhood growing up in the unincorporated community of Schuyler, Virginia, provided the basis for the setting and many of the storylines of &quot;The Waltons&quot;. His family and the community provided many life experiences which aided in the characters, values, area, and human-interest stories of his books, movies, and television series. Hamner provided the voice-over of the older John-Boy, usually heard at the beginning and end of each episode.

John-Boy Walton&#x27;s fictional &quot;alma mater&quot;, Boatwright University, is patterned after Richmond College, which became part of the University of Richmond on Boatwright Drive near Westham Station in The West End of Richmond, Virginia, about east of Schuyler.

===Television film===
&quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; (1971) was not made as a pilot for a series, but it was so popular that it led to CBS initially commissioning one season of episodes based on the same characters, and the result was &quot;The Waltons&quot;. Except for the Walton children and Grandma Esther Walton, the characters were all recast for the TV series. The musical score was by Oscar-winning composer Jerry Goldsmith and was later released on an album by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; paired with James Horner&#x27;s score for the 1982 TV movie &quot;Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn&quot;. (Goldsmith also scored several episodes of the first season, but the producers believed his TV movie theme was too gentle and requested he write a new theme for the series.) The series was also commissioned in response to the rural purge that the networks in general and CBS specifically had done that eliminated most rural-themed shows in 1971, and the subsequent backlash from fans of those shows that were still popular at the time of their cancelation.

Patricia Neal (as Olivia) won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama. The movie was also nominated for 3 Emmys: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie (Neal), Outstanding Writing Achievement in Drama - Adaptation (Earl Hamner), and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Drama - A Single Program (Fielder Cook).

===Filming===
The town of Walton&#x27;s Mountain was built in the rear area of the main lot at Warner Bros. Studios, bordering the Los Angeles River, but the mountain itself was part of the Hollywood Hills range opposite Warner studios in Burbank, California, the reverse side of which, and slightly to the east, is Mount Lee and the Hollywood Sign. The Waltons house façade was built in the back of the Warner Brothers lot. After the series concluded, the set was destroyed. For the reunion shows, a replica Waltons&#x27; house façade was built on the &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; set on the Columbia Ranch studio, now part of the Warner Brothers studios. As of July 2023, the Waltons Columbia Ranch site has been built over with sound stages.

For the first few seasons, the show would oftentimes shoot exterior scenes in Frazier Park, to the north of Los Angeles. They would also occasionally film scenes in Franklin Canyon Park in Beverly Hills.

==Release==

=== Broadcast ===
Some sources indicate CBS put the show on its fall 1972 schedule in response to congressional hearings on the quality of television. Backlash from a 1971 decision to purge most rural-oriented shows from the network lineup may have also been a factor. The network gave &quot;The Waltons&quot; an undesirable timeslot – Thursdays at 8 p.m – opposite 2 popular programs: &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; on NBC and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; on ABC. &quot;The rumor was that they put it against &quot;Flip Wilson&quot; and &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; because they didn&#x27;t think it would survive. They thought, &#x27;We can just tell Congress America doesn&#x27;t want to see this&#x27;,&quot; Kami Cotler, who played Elizabeth Walton, said in a 2012 interview. However, CBS had enough faith in the show to devise a full-page newspaper ad flanked with the show&#x27;s positive reviews, urging people to watch the show. Radically increased ratings were attributed to this ad, saving &quot;The Waltons&quot;.

Ralph Waite was reluctant to audition for the part of John Walton because he didn&#x27;t want to be tied to a long-running TV series, but his agent persuaded him by saying, &quot;It will never sell. You do the pilot. You pick up a couple of bucks and then you go back to New York.&quot;

Following the cancelation of the series in 1981, a total of six reunion movies were released: &quot;A Wedding on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1982),&quot; Mother&#x27;s Day on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1982),&quot; A Day for Thanks on Walton&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1982),&quot; A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion&quot; (1993),&quot; A Walton Wedding&quot; (1995), and&quot; A Walton Easter&quot; (1997).

=== Syndication and reruns ===
Lorimar sold the distribution rights of &quot;The Waltons&quot; to Warner Bros. Television to avoid a lawsuit owing to the similarities between the series and the film &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963), which Warner owned. Warner Bros. acquired Lorimar in 1989, and has continued to syndicate the series ever since.

In the UK, the series was broadcast on BBC2 and BBC1 and during the 1970s/1980s – the first three seasons were broadcast on BBC2 from February 18, 1974, to May 17, 1976, on Mondays at 20.00 GMT, and seasons 4 and 5 were shown on BBC1 from September 5, 1976, to August 30, 1977, on Sundays at 16.10 in 1976 and Tuesdays at 19.00 through 1977. After that, seasons 6–9 would be broadcast on BBC2 again, starting on April 30, 1979, and concluding in April 1983. The three reunion TV movies filmed in 1982 were also shown on BBC2 from December 21 to December 28, 1983. The show was repeated on Channel 4 between 1986 and 1991 and again from 1996 to 2000. It last aired on Sony Channel until March 31, 2020, in the UK.

=== Home media ===
Warner Home Video has released all nine seasons and six TV movies of &quot;The Waltons&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Seasons 1–4 have been released in Region 2. The pilot movie, &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot;, was released by Paramount Home Entertainment. Lorimar produced the series, CBS produced the pilot film, which is why Paramount, under CBS Home Entertainment, handles home video rights for &quot;The Homecoming&quot;.

German-release DVDs provide German or English soundtrack options, with dubbed German voices, or the original English soundtrack, although the German episode titles are not always either literal or precise translations of the original English-language titles. 


===Streaming===
Seasons 1–9 are available via streaming in standard-definition as well as high-definition video through services such as Amazon Prime Video.

==Reception==

===Accolades===
&quot;The Waltons&quot; won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1973. Also in 1973 Richard Thomas won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Michael Learned won the Emmy for Lead Actress in a Drama Series 3 times (1973, 1974, and 1976). Ellen Corby was also a three-time winner in the Supporting Actress category, winning in 1973, 1975, and 1976. Will Geer was awarded the Supporting Actor Emmy in 1975. Veteran actress Beulah Bondi won an Emmy in 1977 for Lead Actress in a Single Performance for her guest appearance as Martha Corrine Walton in the episode &quot;The Pony Cart&quot; (Episode #111). She first appeared in &quot;The Waltons&quot; episode &quot;The Conflict&quot; (Episode #51) as the widow of Zeb Walton&#x27;s brother.

The series itself earned a Peabody Award for its first season. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Waltons&quot; No. 34 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.

In 2017, from March 20 to March 24, INSP network remembered the life of Earl Hamner Jr. (who died in 2016) by featuring clips of interviews (once per episode) with him about his time involved with &quot;The Waltons&quot; during the breaks while its syndicated reruns aired from 3–5pm and again at 7pm.

===Cultural significance===
On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, &quot;We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.&quot; In response, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; made a short animated segment for a repeat showing of the episode &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;, in which the family watches the speech, and Bart remarks, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re just like the Waltons. We&#x27;re prayin&#x27; for an end to the Depression, too.&quot;

==Reboot TV films==

On November 28, 2021, The CW aired &quot;The Waltons: Homecoming&quot;, a remake of &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot;. Also set in 1933, this film features the Walton family (portrayed by new actors) minus Ben, waiting for John to get home by bus. Richard Thomas narrated. Executive producer Sam Haskell hoped the movie would lead to a new series. Another film &quot;A Waltons Thanksgiving&quot; aired on November 20, 2022. In it, Ben was added to the family. Ratings for the second reboot film were much lower.

== Behind the Scenes with Judy Norton ==
On July 14, 2020, Judy Norton (Mary Ellen) launched a series on her YouTube channel entitled &quot;Behind the Scenes with Judy Norton&quot;, where she shares information about &quot;The Waltons&quot;&#x27; filming, cast, episodes, storylines, and cast reunions. She regularly takes the opportunity to answer viewer questions, with more than 100 &quot;Ask Judy&quot; episodes, and she has also hosted several former cast members as well as one of the show&#x27;s directors, Ralph Senensky. Today, the playlist contains 480+ videos, with new releases every few days.

<text>King&#x27;s Cross railway station, also known as London King&#x27;s Cross, is a passenger railway terminus in the London Borough of Camden, on the edge of Central London. It is in the London station group, one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom and the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line to Yorkshire and the Humber, North East England and Scotland. Adjacent to King&#x27;s Cross station is St Pancras International, the London terminus for Eurostar services to continental Europe. Beneath both main line stations is King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station on the London Underground; combined, they form one of the country&#x27;s largest and busiest transport hubs.

The station was opened in Kings Cross in 1852 by the Great Northern Railway on the northern edge of Central London to accommodate the East Coast Main Line. It quickly grew to cater to suburban lines and was expanded several times in the 19th century. As part of the Big Four grouping in 1923, it came under the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway, who introduced famous services such as the Flying Scotsman and locomotives such as &quot;Mallard&quot;. The station complex was redeveloped in the 1970s, simplifying the layout and providing electric suburban services, and it became a major terminus for the high-speed InterCity 125. , long-distance trains from King&#x27;s Cross are run by London North Eastern Railway to , and ; other long-distance operators include Hull Trains and Grand Central. In addition, Great Northern runs suburban commuter trains around North London, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.

In the late 20th century, the area around the station became known for its seedy and downmarket character, and was used as a backdrop for several films as a result. A major redevelopment was undertaken in the 21st century, including restoration of the original roof, and the station became well known for its association with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books and films, particularly the fictional Platform.

==Location and name==
The station stands on the London Inner Ring Road at the eastern end of Euston Road, next to the junction with Pentonville Road, Gray&#x27;s Inn Road and York Way, in what is now the London Borough of Camden. Immediately to the west, on the other side of Pancras Road, is St Pancras railway station. Several London bus routes, including 30, 59, 73, 91, 205, 390 and 476 pass in front of or to the side of the station.

King&#x27;s Cross can be spelled both with and without an apostrophe. &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot; is used in signage at the Network Rail and London Underground stations, on the Tube map and on the official Network Rail webpage. &quot;Kings Cross&quot; is used on the National Rail website. The apostrophe rarely featured on early Underground maps, but has been consistently used on them since 1951. &quot;Kings X&quot;, &quot;Kings +&quot; and &quot;London KX&quot; are abbreviations used in space-limited contexts. The National Rail station code is &quot;KGX&quot;.

== Station Layout ==
The station currently has 11 platforms, numbered 0 to 10 from east to west. Platforms 9 and 10 are short platforms and separated from platforms 0 to 8. Until 2021 there were 12 platforms, numbered 0 to 11 from east to west, but following extensive track remodelling, platform 10 was taken out of use, with platform 11 being relabelled 10.

==History==

===Early history===
The area of King&#x27;s Cross was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the River Fleet, originally known as Broad Ford, later Bradford Bridge. The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. The name &quot;Battle Bridge&quot; is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Celtic British Iceni tribe led by Boudica. According to folklore, King&#x27;s Cross is the site of Boudica&#x27;s final battle and some sources say she is buried under one of the platforms. Platforms 9 and 10 have been suggested as possible sites. Boudica&#x27;s ghost is also reported to haunt passages under the station, around platforms 8–10.

===Great Northern Railway (1850–1923)===

King&#x27;s Cross station was built in 1851–52 as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed. It replaced a temporary station next to Maiden Lane (now York Way) that had been quickly constructed with the line&#x27;s arrival in London in 1850, and had opened on 7 August 1850.

The station took its name from the King&#x27;s Cross building, a monument to King George IV that stood in the area and was demolished in 1845. Construction was on the site of a smallpox hospital.

Plans for the station were made in December 1848 under the direction of George Turnbull, resident engineer for constructing the first of the Great Northern Railway out of London. The station&#x27;s detailed design was by Lewis Cubitt, the brother of Thomas Cubitt (the architect of Bloomsbury, Belgravia and Osborne House), and Sir William Cubitt (who was chief engineer of the Crystal Palace built in 1851, and consulting engineer to the Great Northern and South Eastern Railways). The design comprised two great arched train sheds, with a brick structure at the south end designed to reflect the arches behind. Its main feature was a high clock tower that held treble, tenor and bass bells, the last of these weighing 1 ton 9 cwt (1.47 tonnes). In size, it was inspired by the long Moscow Riding Academy of 1825, leading to its built length of .
The station, the biggest in England at that time, opened on 14 October 1852. Originally it had one arrival and one departure platform (today&#x27;s platforms 1 and 8), and the space between was used for carriage sidings. The platforms have been reconfigured several times. They were numbered 1 to 8 in 1972. In 2010 and 2021 the station was reconfigured again and now has 11 platforms numbered 0 - 10. Suburban traffic quickly grew with the opening of stations at Hornsey in 1850, Holloway Road in 1856, in 1859 and Seven Sisters Road (now ) in 1861. Midland Railway services to via and began running from King&#x27;s Cross on 1 February 1858. More platforms were added in 1862: No. 2 was full-length, but No. 3 was stepped into the northern end of the station. In 1866, a connection was made via the Metropolitan Railway to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway at , with goods and passenger services to South London via . A separate suburban station to the west of the main building, housing platforms 9–11 and known initially as &quot;Kings Cross Main Line (Local) Station&quot;, opened in August 1875. A platform - later numbered platform 16 - was opened on the connection to the Metropolitan Railway on 1 February 1878. (previously trains had had to reverse into the main station) Two platforms (now 5 and 6) were opened on 18 December 1893 to cater for increased traffic demands. An iron footbridge was built halfway down the train shed to connect all the platforms. By 1880, half the traffic at King&#x27;s Cross was suburban.

A significant bottleneck in the early years of operations was at Gas Works tunnel underneath the Regent&#x27;s Canal immediately to the north of the station, which was built with a single up track and a single down track. Commercial traffic was further impeded by having to cross over on-level running lines to reach the goods yard. Grade separation of goods traffic was achieved by constructing the skew bridge that opened in August 1877, and the second and third Gas Works tunnels opened in 1878 and 1892 respectively.

On 15 September 1881, a light engine and a coal train collided near the mouth of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman&#x27;s error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. Bad weather contributed to occasional flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which happened at no other London terminus.

King&#x27;s Cross sustained no damage during World War I even though large amounts of high explosives were carried to the station in passenger trains during the war. When possible, trains were parked in tunnels in the event of enemy aircraft overhead.

===London and North Eastern Railway (1923–1948)===

Kings Cross came into the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921. The LNER made improvements to various amenities, including toilets and dressing rooms underneath what is now platform 8. The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling made it easier to manage the increasing number of local trains.

A number of famous trains have been associated with King&#x27;s Cross, such as the Flying Scotsman service to Edinburgh. The Gresley A3 and later streamlined A4 Pacific steam locomotives handled express services from the 1930s until 1966. The most famous of these was &quot;Mallard&quot;, which holds the world speed record for steam locomotives at , set in 1938.

King&#x27;s Cross handled large numbers of troops alongside civilian traffic during World War II. Engine shortages meant that up to 2,000 people had to be accommodated on each train. In the early hours of Sunday 11 May 1941, two bombs fell on the, then, platform 10 at the west side of the station, damaging a newspaper train in that platform and destroying the general offices, booking hall and a bar, and bringing down a large section of roof. Twelve people were killed.

On 4 February 1945, a passenger train to Leeds and Bradford stalled in Gasworks Tunnel, ran back and was derailed in the station. Two people were killed and 25 were injured. Services were not fully restored until 23 February.

===British Rail (1948–1996)===

Following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, King&#x27;s Cross came under the management of British Railways&#x27; Eastern Region. Diesel services were introduced during the 1950s when steam was being phased out. All main line services were converted to diesel by June 1963. Platform numbers were reorganised in 1972, to run consecutively from 1 (east) to 14 (west). The track layout was simplified in the 1970s by reusing an old flyover for freight near the Copenhagen Tunnels at Holloway, and reducing the number of running lines through the Gas Works tunnels from six to four. At the same time, electrification started with the installation of a 25 kV overhead line to cater for suburban services as part of the Great Northern Suburban Electrification project. The works were completed on 3 April 1977, and electric services began running from King&#x27;s Cross to Hertford, and 

The construction of the Victoria line and its interchange at King&#x27;s Cross was seen by British Rail as an opportunity to modernise the station. A single-storey extension containing the main passenger concourse and ticket office, designed in-house, was built at the front of the station in 1972. Although intended to be temporary, it was still standing 40 years later, obscuring the Grade I-listed façade of the original station. Before the extension was built, the façade was hidden behind a small terrace of shops. The extension was demolished in late 2012, revealing the Lewis Cubitt architecture. In its place, the King&#x27;s Cross Square was created, and opened to the public on 26 September 2013.

On 10 September 1973, a Provisional IRA bomb exploded in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m., causing extensive damage and injuring six people, some seriously. The device was thrown without warning by a youth who escaped into the crowd and was not caught.

King&#x27;s Cross was a London terminus for InterCity 125 high speed services, along with Paddington. By 1982, almost all long-distance trains leaving King&#x27;s Cross were 125s. The service proved to be popular, and the station saw regular queues across the concourse to board departing trains.

The King&#x27;s Cross fire in 1987 started in the machine room for a wooden escalator between the main line station and the London Underground station&#x27;s Piccadilly line platforms. The escalator burned and much of the tube station caught fire, killing 31 people, with smoke spreading to the main line station.

In 1987, British Rail proposed building a new station with four platforms for international trains through the Channel Tunnel, and four for Thameslink trains under King&#x27;s Cross. After six years of design work, the plans were abandoned, and the international terminal was constructed at St Pancras.

British Rail completed electrification of the East Coast Main Line to and Edinburgh between 1985 and 1991, and electric InterCity 225 rolling stock was introduced to work express services. These began service between King&#x27;s Cross and Leeds on 2 October 1989, and to Edinburgh on 8 July 1991.

===Privatisation (1996–present)===

Before privatisation, the King&#x27;s Cross area had a reputation for run-down buildings and prostitution in front of the main entrance. There was a major clean-up during the 1990s and the station&#x27;s atmosphere was much improved by the end of the decade.

Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, express services into the station were taken over by the Great North Eastern Railway (GNER). The company refurbished the British Rail Mark 4 &quot;Mallard&quot; rolling stock used for long-distance services from King&#x27;s Cross and the inauguration of the new-look trains took place in the presence of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in 2003.

GNER successfully re-bid for the franchise in 2005, but surrendered it in the following year. National Express East Coast took over the franchise in late 2007 after an interim period when trains ran under a management contract. In 2009, it was announced that National Express was no longer willing to finance the East Coast subsidiary, and the franchise was taken back into public ownership and handed over to East Coast in November. In March 2015 the franchise was re-privatised and taken over by Virgin Trains East Coast. In November 2017, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announced the early termination of the East Coast franchise in 2020, three years ahead of schedule, following losses on the route by the operator. The current provider of ECML services is London North Eastern Railway.

===Restoration===

The £500 million restoration plan announced by Network Rail in 2005 was approved by Camden London Borough Council in 2007. It involved restoring and reglazing the original arched train shed roof and removing the 1972 extension at the front of the station and replacing it with an open-air plaza.

The new semi-circular departures concourse opened to the public in March 2012. Situated to the west of the station behind the Great Northern Hotel, it was designed by John McAslan and built by Taylor Woodrow Construction, part of Vinci. It caters for much-increased passenger flows and provides greater integration between the intercity, suburban and underground sections of the station. The architect claimed that the roof is the longest single-span station structure in Europe and the semi-circular structure has a radius of and more than 2,000 triangular roof panels, half of which are glass.
Land between and behind Kings Cross and St Pancras stations is being redeveloped as King&#x27;s Cross Central with around 2,000 new homes, of offices and new roads. In the restoration, refurbished offices have opened on the east side of the station to replace ones lost on the west side, and a new platform, numbered 0, opened underneath them on 20 May 2010. Diesel trains cannot normally use this platform for environmental reasons. The restoration project was awarded a European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2013.

In October 2021, Lumo commenced operating services to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle and Morpeth.

===Remodelling===

In January 2018, it was announced that half the station would close for 3 months from January to March 2020 for remodelling work to the station and its approach, expected to cost £237 million. This includes rationalisation of the tracks, reopening the third tunnel to the approach of the station and closure of platform 10. In June 2021, Network Rail released a time lapse video showing the completion of the works.

===Accidents and incidents===

There have been many passenger train accidents at King&#x27;s Cross over the years. The most serious were the King&#x27;s Cross railway accident on 4 February 1945 which killed two people and injured 25 and a collision in Gasworks Tunnel on 15 September 1881 which killed one person and seriously injured another. The most recent was on 17 September 2015 when a passenger train collided with the buffer stops, injuring fourteen people. There have also been a number of accidents which killed or injured railway employees.

On 5 November 1979, Martin Allen was seen saying goodbye to his friends at King&#x27;s Cross. He set off in the direction of the Piccadilly line platform, but he was never seen again. The station is also where Andrew Gosden was last seen before going missing on 14 September 2007. He had caught a train there from under controversial and unexplained circumstances.

==Other stations==

===King&#x27;s Cross York Road===

From 1863, part of King&#x27;s Cross was an intermediate station. On the extreme east of the site, King&#x27;s Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury Park before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.

===Great Northern Cemetery Station===
The Great Northern Cemetery Station was built just to the east of the northern portal to Gasworks Tunnel, to connect the city to New Southgate Cemetery. It opened in 1861 but was never profitable as it only ran for and closed two years later.

==Services==


The station hosts services on inter-city routes to the East of England, Yorkshire, North East England and eastern and northern Scotland, connecting to major cities and towns such as Cambridge, Peterborough, Hull, Doncaster, Leeds, Bradford, York, Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness. Since June 2018, these major routes have been under government control, taking over from Stagecoach and Virgin.

==London Underground station==
King&#x27;s Cross station shares a London Underground station with neighbouring St Pancras station. King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station is served by more lines than any other station on the London Underground. In , King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras was the station on the system, with million passengers entering and exiting the station. It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and caters for both King&#x27;s Cross and the neighbouring St Pancras railway station.

The station opened as part of the first section of Metropolitan Railway project on 10 January 1863; the first part of the Underground to open. A separate station for the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (now the Piccadilly line) opened on 15 December 1906, with the City &amp; South London Railway (now the Northern line) opening on 12 May 1907. The Metropolitan line platforms were moved to their current location in 1941.

The Victoria line platforms were opened on 1 December 1968. A major expansion to accommodate High Speed 1 at St Pancras opened in November 2009.

==Cultural references==

===In fiction===

The station is mentioned in Chapter 2 of E.M. Forster&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;Howards End&quot;, where it suggests &quot;infinity&quot; to the eldest Schlegel daughter, Margaret, and contrasted with the &quot;facile splendours&quot; of St. Pancras. In the Reverend Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s 1957 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Eight Famous Engines&quot;, Gordon the Big Engine undertakes a journey to London, hoping to reach King&#x27;s Cross, but ends up at St Pancras instead.

In the 1994 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Secret of Platform 13&quot; by Eva Ibbotson. Platform 13 of King&#x27;s Cross Station in London has been closed for years. Changes to the platform always result in failure for mysterious reasons. The reason is that the platform hides a gump, described as an &quot;opening that opens once every nine years for nine days&quot;. The gump leads to the Island, a wonderful mythical paradise filled with both normal and magical creatures.
King&#x27;s Cross features in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, by J. K. Rowling, as the starting point of the Hogwarts Express. The train uses a secret Platform accessed through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10. In fact, platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intervening tracks. Instead, the brick roof-support arches between platforms 4 and 5 were redressed by the film crew and used to represent a brick wall that does not exist between the real platforms 9 and 10.

By 2003, a sign marking Platform 9 3/4 was put up at the station, with a trolley fixed to the wall added by the year 2005. The location of the trolley moved after renovations, and a Harry Potter-themed shop opened nearby in 2012. Because of the temporary buildings obscuring the façade of the real King&#x27;s Cross station until 2012, the Harry Potter films showed St. Pancras in exterior station shots instead.

When The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort expanded to Universal Studios Florida, the Wizarding Worlds in both Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida and Hogsmeade at Universal&#x27;s Islands of Adventure were connected with the Hogwarts Express. The Universal Studios Florida station is based on King&#x27;s Cross station and Platform , including a quarter-scale replica of the façade of King&#x27;s Cross as the entrance to the station. It opened on 8 July 2014, alongside Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. It replaced the Jaws ride and the Amity Island themed area based on the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise, which was permanently closed on 2 January 2012.

===In film===
The station, its surrounding streets and the railway approach feature prominently in the 1955 Ealing comedy film &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;. In the story, a gang robs a security van near the station after planning in a house overlooking the railway. When they fall out, members of the gang are dropped into passing goods wagons from the parapet of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station.

The 1986 crime drama film &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is set around King&#x27;s Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area surrounding the station, coupled with urban decay, made it an ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage of crime and prostitution around King&#x27;s Cross referred back to the film.

Pet Shop Boys released a song titled &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot; on the 1987 album &quot;Actually&quot; and the station was extensively filmed in for the group&#x27;s 1988 feature film &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;. The band&#x27;s singer Neil Tennant said that the station was a recognisable landmark coming into London, attempting to find opportunities away from the high unemployment areas of Northeast England at the time. The song was primarily about &quot;hopes being dashed&quot; and &quot;an epic nightmare&quot;. The group subsequently asked filmmaker Derek Jarman to direct a background video for &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot; for their 1989 tour, which featured a black and white sequence of juddery camera movements around the local area. Despite the song&#x27;s reference to &quot;dead and wounded on either side&quot;, it was actually released a few months &quot;before&quot; the King&#x27;s Cross fire.

===Monopoly===
King&#x27;s Cross station is a square on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board. The other three stations in the game are Marylebone, Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street, and all four were LNER termini at the time the game was being designed for the British market in the mid-1930s.

<text>Langres () is a commune in northeastern France. It is a subprefecture of the department of Haute-Marne, in the region of Grand Est.

==History==
As the capital of the Romanized Gallic tribe known as the Lingones, it was called Andematunnum, then Lingones, and now Langres.

A hilltop town, Langres was built on a limestone promontory of the same name. This stronghold was originally occupied by the Lingones. At a later date the Romans fortified the town, which they called Andemantunum, located at a strategic crossroads of twelve Roman roads. The first-century Triumphal Gate and the many artefacts exhibited in the museums are remnants of the town&#x27;s Gallo-Roman history. After the period of invasions, the town prospered in the Middle Ages, due in part to the growing political influence of its bishops. The diocese covered Champagne, the Duchy of Burgundy, and Franche-Comté, and the bishops obtained the right to coin money in the ninth century and to name the military governor of the city in 927. The Bishop of Langres was a duke and peer of France. The troubled 14th and 15th centuries caused the town to strengthen its defenses, which still give the old city its fortified character, and Langres entered a period of royal tutelage. The Renaissance, which returned prosperity to the town, saw the construction of numerous fine civil, religious and military buildings that still stand today. In the 19th century, a &quot;Vauban&quot; citadel was added.

==Main sights==
Langres has a historic town center surrounded by defensive walls with a dozen towers and seven gates.

The cathedral of Saint-Mammès is a late 12th-century structure dedicated to Mammes of Caesarea, a 3rd-century martyr.

==Culture==
Langres is home to producers of an AOC-protected cheese of the same name. It is a soft, pungent cow&#x27;s milk cheese that is known for its rind, which is washed.

The town was long known for its cutlery industry. Didier Diderot, father of encyclopedist Denis, was a cutler.

A museum called the Denis Diderot House of Enlightenment opened in 2013. This museum, set up in a private mansion from the 16th and 18th centuries, is dedicated to the philosopher Denis Diderot.
