<text>Bessus or Bessos (; ), also known by his throne name Artaxerxes V ( ; ; died summer 329 BC), was a Persian satrap of the eastern Achaemenid satrapy of Bactria, as well as the self-proclaimed King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire from 330 to 329 BC.

A member of the ruling Achaemenid dynasty, Bessus came to power shortly after killing the legitimate Achaemenid ruler Darius III (), and subsequently attempted to hold the eastern part of the empire against the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (). His realm quickly started to fall apart, including Bactria, which was the main center. Fleeing into Sogdia, he was arrested by his own officers, who handed him over to Alexander, who had him executed at Ecbatana.

Bessus appears in the 11th-century Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; under the name of Janusipar/Janushyar.

== Name ==
&quot;Bessus&quot; (Βήσσος) is the Greek transliteration of the Old Persian name &quot;*Bayaçā&quot; (&quot;protecting from fear&quot;). &quot;&quot; is the Latin form of the Greek &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; (), itself from the Old Persian &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot; (, &quot;whose reign is through truth&quot;). It is known in other languages as; Elamite &quot;Ir-tak-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;, &quot;Ir-da-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;; Akkadian &quot;Ar-ta-ʾ-ḫa-šá-is-su&quot;; Middle Persian and New Persian &quot;Ardašīr&quot;.

== Career ==
Nothing is known about the background of Bessus, except that he belonged to the ruling Achaemenid dynasty. During the reign of the King of Kings Darius III (), Bessus was made the satrap of Bactria, an important satrapy in the eastern part of the empire. Bactria, which had been under Achaemenid rule since 545–540 BC, was prosperous and populous. As shown by archaeological findings, agriculture, trade, commerce and handicraft thrived in the area. The office of satrap of Bactria seems to have occasionally been equivalent to a &quot;vice-king of the east&quot; type of position.

As the satrap of Bactria, Bessus was able to exert his rule over Sogdia to the north, and regions that bordered India. He managed to retain the loyalty of the Iranian nomadic groups in Central Asia, the Saka, the Dahae and the Massagetae. According to the Iranologist Richard Foltz, the eastern satrapies were practically Bessus&#x27; personal domain. Following the Persian defeat at the Battle of Issus against the Macedonian king Alexander the Great () in 333 BC, Darius III summoned Bessus to aid him. 

Bessus later took part in the Battle of Gaugamela against Alexander in 331 BC, where he supplied Darius III with a contingent composed of Bactrians, Sogdians, Indians, as well as his Saka allies. He led the cavalry on the left wing of the Persian forces, with the intention of crippling Alexander&#x27;s attack on that flank. Following the Persian defeat at the battle, Bessus followed Darius III in his flight to the city of Ecbatana in Media. There Bessus conspired against Darius III with other Persian grandees, such as the chiliarch Nabarzanes, and Barsaentes, the satrap of Arachosia–Drangiana. Together they arrested Darius III in mid-330 BC, with Bessus being chosen as the leader of the Achaemenid forces, probably due to his Achaemenid descent. The arrest of Darius III gave Alexander the pretext of avenging him. Fleeing from the pursuing Macedonian forces, Bessus and the rebels carried Darius III in a covered wagon, reportedly in golden chains. In order to buy some time for their escape, Bessus and his co-conspirators killed Darius III and left his body by the road. The murder took place near Hecatompylus, in July 330 BC. Darius III&#x27;s body was later found by Alexander, who had him buried in the royal crypt in Persepolis.

== Reign ==

In the autumn of 330, at the Bactrian capital of Bactra, Bessus declared himself King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire, assuming the royal name of Artaxerxes V. There he attempted to hold the eastern part of the empire against Alexander. His domain encompassed Bactria, the main center; Sogdia, administered by officers such as Spitamenes and Oxyartes; the nomadic Iranian tribes of Central Asia; Aria, governed by the satrap Satibarzanes, who had initially surrendered to Alexander; Arachosia-Drangiana, governed by Barsaentes; Parthia and Hyrcania, governed by Nabarazanes following his appointment by Bessus; and western India. Bessus&#x27; usurpation and the invigorated resistance in Central Asia created a new problem for the Macedonians. If they failed to confront Bessus, his usurpation could be seen as change in government, thus rendering Darius III&#x27;s death irrelevant. However, Bessus&#x27; empire quickly started to fall apart; Nabarzanes, accepting his hopeless position, surrendered to Alexander and was pardoned with the help of Bagoas. Satibarzanes was defeated and killed by the Macedonian forces in 329 BC, before Bessus was able to help him. Around the same time, Barsaentes fled to India to escape the Macedonian forces.

According to the 1st-century BC Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (died 30 BC), Bessus had plans to defend Bactria, and urged its inhabitants to fight for their independence. He was able to muster a satrapal levy of 8,000 Bactrians, seemingly the remnants of the troops that had fought under him at Gaugamela. However, many of those soldiers dispersed after receiving news that Alexander had crossed the Hindu Kush. Instead of making a stand, Bessus fled into Sogdia by crossing the Oxus, where he hoped to obtain aid from the Sogdians, the Chorasmians, and the &quot;Scythians dwelling beyond the river Tanais&quot;. His flight from Bactria alienated many of his Bactrian supporters. The Canadian historian Waldemar Heckel suggests that Bessus may have in reality not been particularly popular, and adds that his most prominent supporters had either been killed or fled. The hyparchs and local dynasts of Bactria-Sogdiana now realized that they were isolated, and so a victory – at least a great one – was unlikely. 

Alexander, since his victory at Gaugamela, had behaved in the same manner as a sovereign ruler, and had been on several occasions afterwards acknowledged as the &quot;King of Asia.&quot; His actions indicated that he planned to continue the administrative system of the Achaemenid Empire, which meant that the local leaders in Central Asia would be allowed to maintain their authority. Furthermore, Alexander had not only pardoned many of his former opponents, but had also restored them to their former satrapies. Thus, the indigenous rulers now regarded Bessus as being a threat to their continued security. At Nautaca (present-day Shahrisabz) Bessus was arrested by his Sogdian officers, who included Spitamenes, Dataphernes, and Catanes. They then handed him over to the following Macedonian forces. The handing over of Bessus took place in a village, where he had been left by Spitamenes and Dataphernes. He was picked up by the Macedonian general Ptolemy who following Alexander&#x27;s instructions, had Bessus brought to him naked in bonds. Bessus was at first flogged in public, and then his ears and nose were cut off, a traditional Persian punishment. He was finally sent to Ecbatana, where the Macedonians had him executed. The execution was supervised by Darius III&#x27;s brother Oxyathres.

== In Persian literature ==
Bessus appears in the 11th-century Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;Book of Kings&quot;) under the name of Janusipar/Janushyar. Seeing as they are in a hopeless position, Janusipar along with Mahyar (Nabarzanes) murders Dara II (Darius III) and then attempt to negotiate with Iskandar (Alexander), eventually meeting up with him. Following the funeral of Dara, Iskandar has Janusipar and Mahyar executed.

<text>Cowley is a village with the town of Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon. A largely suburban village with 16 listed buildings, Cowley is 15.4 miles (24.8 km) west of Charing Cross, bordered to the west by Uxbridge Moor in the Green Belt and the River Colne, forming the border with Buckinghamshire. Cowley was an ancient parish in the historic county of Middlesex.

==Toponymy==
Cowley&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Cofenlea&quot;: &quot;Cofa&#x27;s woodland clearing.&quot; The earliest written record of the settlement is from 959.

==History==

===Medieval period===
St. Laurence Church was in recorded as in the parish of Cowley in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; along with the parish land owned by Westminster Abbey, valued as worth to its lord two pounds per year in 1066 and at one pound ten shillings in 1086. Its independent male householders were two villagers, one cottage-owner with one cultivated ploughland for one lord&#x27;s plough team. Lord&#x27;s lands (also referred to as a manorial park) took up 1.5 ploughs of land, and meadow land half a plough. The woodland was worth forty pigs (per year) and a mill was worth for five shillings per year.

Cowley was surrounded by Hillingdon parish, of which the town of Uxbridge itself and Uxbridge Moor, which separated Cowley from Buckinghamshire on the west, formed part. Part of the Moor is now the M25 motorway. Within the triangle formed where the River Pinn and Fray&#x27;s River meet, Cowley parish was so intermixed with Hillingdon that parts of it were entirely detached from the rest, while other parts, some detached, lay farther east across the Pinn. For this reason most of the general history of the parish has to be dissected from that of Hillingdon. These complex parish borders were those of just one manor carved out before the Norman conquest from Hillingdon. While Hillingdon parish administered to many areas now in Cowley, most of these were in one manor within Hillingdon whose name is preserved by few places in maps, Colham.

In the west, along the main road between Uxbridge and Yiewsley, and mostly to the north of the Iver Lane turning, lay the village formerly known as Cowley Street, mostly in Cowley parish. This hamlet and the church hamlet formed the main areas of settlement within the parish, though there were a few houses elsewhere, including some at what is now called Cowley Peachey, the southern part of Cowley. In 1252 Charter Rolls show that Bartholomew Peche (or Pecche), a favourite of Henry III was granted tenancy of Westminster Abbey&#x27;s estate in Cowley. The Peche family held the manor for over a hundred years and by 1358 its name had become &quot;Couele Peche&quot; (Cowley Peachey). This was first recorded in the &quot;Calendar of Inquisitions post mortem&quot;.

==Post-Reformation and boundaries==

Before 1882, when the first important changes were made in its boundaries, the parish of Cowley spanned extremely irregularly shaped but mostly south of Uxbridge, between Frays River (the county boundary, part of the braided Colne) on the west and the River Pinn, which runs into it on the east. A small piece () of glebe land belonged to Cowley church on the other side of Hillingdon by Long Lane.

In 1796 Cowley Field was inclosed, with the statutory object of consolidating the parishes of Hillingdon and Cowley. As a result, Cowley received several blocks of land, of which the largest were connected to the part of the parish by the church and to the part at Cowley Street by roads which the Commissioners decreed were to be repaired by Cowley parish and which therefore became part of it. Four parts of the field north of the Greenway were also assigned to Cowley but remained detached (nos. 1–4 on the map), and so did two others farther south by the High Street and by Maygoods Lane (nos. 5–6). Nomansland (no. 7), across the Pinn, also remained cut off from the rest of the parish, while the little field of glebe nearly 2 miles away in Long Lane (no. 8) was unaffected by the award.

In 1547 the parish contained 36 &#x27;houseling&#x27; people, in 1719 there were 109 inhabitants, and in 1801 the population was 214. The small cluster of homes at the village centre and dispersal of parishioners based on the old, medieval scope of the manor&#x27;s lands meant a low sense of community and identity especially for outlying owners. Furthermore, some fields and orchards of Cowley had become additions to plots falling in Hillingdon so tithes would be the only ties left if plot holders lived in houses on Hillingdon land. The manorial court for many centuries made regulations and byelaws about fencing and grazing of the open fields, pasture meadows, and commons, particularly as to the stinting of animals.

==Industrial Revolution==

=== The Grand Junction Canal===
On 3 November 1794 the Grand Junction Canal was opened from the River Thames at Brentford to Uxbridge, routing on the western side of Cowley Peachey and Cowley Street. Construction began with cuttings Uxbridge Moor on 1 May 1793 and in early May at Brentford and Braunston. However toll collectors weren&#x27;t appointed at Uxbridge and Brentford until May 1795. It is likely the aqueduct over the Fray&#x27;s River at Cowley Lock wasn&#x27;t completed until the Autumn of 1795 with measures undertaken there to allow traffic to pass through there. With the opening of the canal&#x27;s Paddington Arm on 10 July 1801 packet boats drawn by four horses ran from Paddington Basin on the edge of London to the &#x27;turning point&#x27; docks at Cowley Peachey. Packet Boat Lane and the former Paddington Packet Boat public house, licensed in 1804, reflect this period.

===Cowley Stock Bricks===
The opening of the Grand Junction Canal enabled the development of the brick industry in Cowley. In December 1810 twenty-one acres of land adjoining the canal calculated to contain brick earth sufficient to make from sixty to seventy million bricks was offered for let. Four hundred yards south of Cowley Lock a 350 yard arm of the Grand Union Canal called Cowley Hall Dock was opened in 1811 to service the Cowley Hall Brick-Field. Between March and October 1814 four million bricks were delivered from the brick-field. With this early development of Cowley&#x27;s brick earth deposits the generic name of the brick in West Middlesex became known as the Cowley Stock Brick. 

===Great Western Railway Uxbridge branch line===
In 1856 a Great Western Railway branch line opened, operating between West Drayton station in Yiewsley on the Great Western Main Line and Uxbridge Vine Street Station. The railway encouraged the development of Cowley becoming a centre of market and nursery-gardens, supplying fresh flowers to the markets at Covent Garden and Spitalfields. Although the line ran through Cowley a station was not constructed here until 1904. Cowley railway station closed in 1962 due to falling passenger demand. Station Road reflects the past station which was situated where Huxley Close is today.

Despite the spread of building from Uxbridge in the north, the beginnings of industry at Cowley Peachey and the three large mills just outside the western boundary of the parish, Cowley remained an almost entirely rural village until after World War I. In 1891, just before the parish was enlarged, the population was 322. In 1901, after the enlargement, it was 869, and this had only risen to 1,170 by 1931. During the 1930s there was a good deal of building, partly by Uxbridge council, and the population of the same area was 3,687 in 1951. Until 1965 a great many more houses were built, bringing the total provided by the council to nearly 1,000 in 1959, so that much of the area east of the main road and south of Station Road has been covered, though allotments remain between Hillingdon and Cowley. The diversion of Peachey Lane in 1938 and the blocking of Maygoods Lane about 1953 changed the old road plan of this part of the parish.

Cowley became part of the urban district of Uxbridge in 1929 and part of Uxbridge civil parish in 1937.

==Geology==
Between the boundaries marked by the Pinn and Colne the soil is traditionally called (fertile) brick-earth which has medium permeability whereas east of the Pinn covering most of London is London clay and gravel, a mixture of good and poor drainage. On more descriptive modern analysis the soil is &quot;slowly permeable seasonally wet acid loamy and clayey soil&quot;, with non-permeable loamy soil marking the lowest part.

==Geography==

Cowley lies on a southwest-sloping ridge above mean sea level and is a village contiguous with Uxbridge to the north with its own ecclesiastical parish church and once a civil parish. It is bordered to the west by the Metropolitan Green Belt, the River Colne and Buckinghamshire. To the south the River Pinn forms its boundary with Yiewsley and to the east with Hillingdon.

Two conservation areas are in the village: Cowley Lock and Cowley Church (St Laurence). Cowley Lock, designated in 1975, includes all of Old Mill Lane, Cowley Lake, wet woodland, Little Britain, Cowley bridges, Packet Boat Lane and the Packet Boat turning area. Cowley Church (St. Laurence) Conservation area was designated in 1988 and includes the Church and nearby buildings and to the south, Manor Farm.

===Little Britain Lake===
Little Britain Lake in the west of Cowley extends for about 450 metres between the Colne and a channel of it known as Frays River. The lake, which is in the Colne Valley Regional Park conservation area, is roughly the shape of the Great Britain. It is noted for less common water birds, such as gadwall and great crested grebe, and for more common species including mute swan and grey heron.

==Landmarks==
A number of older buildings survive, forming in Cowley all but one of the 15 architecturally listed buildings, the other being the main lecture building of Brunel University.
Cowley House, and the Manor Farm are the most architecturally and historically significant. In the High Street, Old Vine Cottage, &quot;The Crown&quot;, and Maygood&#x27;s Farm date from before 1700, and there are several detached 18th-century houses there, some of which may incorporate earlier work. At Cowley Peachey are two timber-framed houses: the Old Cottage probably dates from the 15th or early 16th century and is a three-bay house of which the central bay was originally an open hall. At some later date the hall was divided into two storeys and a brick chimney was inserted. The Malt Shovel in Iver Lane is also Grade II listed.

===St Laurence Church===

St Laurence Church is listed higher than all of the other buildings in Cowley architecturally, at Grade II*, this building was in existence by the 12th century and was the smallest Parish Church in Middlesex. It stands near the River Pinn and was on the eastern side of the Cowley Manor. There is no evidence historically of there being a settlement of any size here, though there were probably always one or two buildings beside the Church.

===Brunel University===
The main &quot;Uxbridge campus&quot; of the university is in the north east of Cowley.

<text>Cranham is a residential area of east London, and part of the London Borough of Havering. It is located east-northeast of Charing Cross and comprises an extensive built-up area to the north and a low density conservation area to the south surrounded by open land. It was historically a rural village in the county of Essex and formed an ancient parish. It is peripheral to London, forming the eastern edge of the urban sprawl. The economic history of Cranham is characterised by a shift from agriculture to housing development. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Cranham significantly increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. The 2011 Census population of Cranham was included in Upminster.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Cranham is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as comprising two manors. The smaller was in the north of the parish, and called &quot;Craohv&quot; and in 1201 as &quot;Craweno&quot;. It means &#x27;spur of land frequented by crows&#x27; and is formed from the Old English &#x27;crāwe&#x27; and &#x27;hōh&#x27;. The larger was the Anglo-Saxon manor of Ockendon (&quot;Wochenduna&quot;) During the Middle Ages, and until around the 15th century, it was also known as Bishop&#x27;s Ockendon because a large part of its area was owned by the Bishop of London.

===Economic development===
The parish is recorded in 1086 as being heavily wooded, supporting an agrarian way of life. Forest clearance was well advanced by the 15th century, with an increase in population and arable land; and there was a mill in Cranham. Cranham lay on brick earth and this gave rise to the Cranham Brick and Tile Company which was in operation from 1900 to 1920. Drury has suggested that early trade was with the nearby settlements of Romford and Hornchurch and with London via the River Thames at Rainham.

===Local government===

Cranham formed an ancient parish of in the Chafford hundred of Essex. The vestry met in the church until 1829 and then at the parish workhouse. In 1836 the parish was grouped for poor relief into the Romford Poor Law Union and for sanitary provision in 1875 into Romford rural sanitary district. The sanitary district became Romford Rural District from 1894 and a parish council was formed to replace the vestry.

The parish formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933. To reflect the significantly increased population in the area, Romford Rural District was abolished in 1934 and Cranham was amalgamated with neighbouring parishes into Hornchurch Urban District. The parish council was abolished and Hornchurch Urban District Council became the local authority. There was a revision of boundaries with North Ockendon, which had been part of Orsett Rural District, absorbed into Cranham and a small area to the north, near Great Warley, transferred to Brentwood Urban District.

In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was abolished and its former area was transferred from Essex to Greater London, to be combined with that of the Municipal Borough of Romford in order to form the present-day London Borough of Havering. In 1993 the Greater London boundary, to the east of Cranham and north of the railway line, was locally realigned to the M25 motorway, returning some mostly unpopulated areas of open land to Essex and leaving North Ockendon as the only part of Greater London outside the bounds of the motorway.

===Urban development===

In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, including Cranham Hall, became attractive properties for merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts to expand the suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems because of the lack of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham&#x27;s location on the very edge of London&#x27;s urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary&#x27;s Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.

==Governance==
Cranham forms part of the Hornchurch and Upminster UK Parliament constituency, and is partly within the Havering wards of Upminster and Cranham. Together these form the Upminster Area Committee. The current MP is Julia Lopez (politician). Each ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All six councillors elected in 2010 for the two wards were the Upminster and Cranham Residents&#x27; Association candidates and the area is unusual in that the residents&#x27; association is strongly active. From 1945 to 1974 Cranham formed part of the Hornchurch constituency and from 1974 to 2010 it formed part of the Upminster constituency. Cranham is within the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

==Geography==

Most of Cranham is located on the London Clay belt, with loam to the north and a gravel valley to the south. It rises to about in the north and to below in the south; with a ridge running east to west upon which All Saints&#x27; Church is located. Cranham forms a continuously built-up area with Upminster to the west, with open fields separating it from Harold Wood in the north, Great Warley to the east and North Ockendon to the southeast. Franks Wood and Cranham Brickfields are designated a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation with a habitat of ancient woodland, coppices, ditches, scrub, tall herbs and neutral grassland. The community forest centre for the extensive Thames Chase is located in the open land to the south east. Cranham forms part of the Upminster post town in the RM14 postcode district. Climate data for Cranham is taken from the nearest weather station at Greenwich, around southwest of All Saints church:
==Demography==

Demographic data is produced by the Office for National Statistics for the wards of Cranham and Upminster. All of Cranham is contained within these wards, however they also cover the connected settlement of Upminster and the rural outlier of North Ockendon. In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared to the rest of London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards.

==Economy==
There are several short parades of shops; the largest on Front Lane, dominated by a Tesco Express store. The nearest significant activity centre identified in the London Plan is the local district centre at Upminster. Within Havering, Upminster is identified as the nearest of seven main town centres. There are a number of commercial businesses centred around the A127 Southend Arterial Road including a wholesale butcher, mushroom cultivator, caravan sales, and a sports equipment supplier. There are a limited number of hospitality venues, including pubs and a popular tandoori restaurant.

==Transport==
Front Lane is the main road through Cranham and runs north to south, connecting with the A127 road in the north. Approximately to the northeast it has a junction with the M25 motorway, which forms the outer ring road of London. Cranham is the location of the Upminster depot of the London Underground&#x27;s District line. The nearest London Underground station is at Upminster, approximately to the west. The London-Tilbury-Southend line of the National Rail network passes through the area in two places, with the nearest station also at Upminster. There are Transport for London bus service to Upminster, Hornchurch, Romford, and Ockendon station on routes 248, 346 and 347.

==Culture==

All Saints&#x27; parish church was rebuilt in 1873 and is a grade II listed building. James Oglethorpe, the founder of the state of Georgia, now part of the United States of America, is buried with his wife at the centre of its chancel. The area around the church forms a conservation area. There is a second church called St Luke&#x27;s further north on Front Lane. Cranham Hall, the former manor house, is a grade II listed building. There are two community associations that are both registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated by the Front Lane Community Association, and provides a limited range of activities. The main cultural and entertainment facilities of the borough are located in Hornchurch and Romford.

<text>The Royal Borough of Greenwich (, , or ) is a London borough in southeast Greater London, England. The London Borough of Greenwich was formed in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963. The new borough covered the former area of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich and most of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich to the east. The local council is Greenwich London Borough Council which meets in Woolwich Town Hall.

Greenwich is the location of the Greenwich prime meridian, on which all Coordinated Universal Time is based. The prime meridian running through Greenwich, and the Greenwich Observatory is where the designation Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT began, and on which all world times are based. In 2012, Greenwich was listed as a top ten global destination by Frommer&#x27;s – the only UK destination to be listed.

To mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Greenwich became a Royal Borough on 3 February 2012, due in part to its historic links with the royal family, but also to its UNESCO World Heritage Site status as home of the Prime Meridian.

==History==
The area of the modern borough had historically been part of the county of Kent. From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, two of which were called Greenwich and Woolwich.

The London Borough of Greenwich was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It covered the combined area of the two metropolitan boroughs of Greenwich and Woolwich, with the exception that North Woolwich, on the north side of the River Thames, went instead to the London Borough of Newham.

The name &#x27;Charlton&#x27; was briefly considered as the name for the new borough. Greenwich Council applied for city status in 2002, but was turned down.

In 2012, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the borough was given the additional honorific status of being a royal borough, in recognition of the area&#x27;s historic links with the Royal Family and its status as home of the Prime Meridian and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Geography==
The borough lies along the south bank of the River Thames between Deptford and Thamesmead. It has an area of 5,044 hectares. Because of the bends of the river, its waterfront is as long as 8.5 miles. Travelling south away from the waterfront, the ground rises: Shooters Hill in the east and the high ground of Blackheath in the west bookend the borough, Eltham to the south of these hills falls away slightly.

Greenwich is bounded by the London Boroughs of Bexley to the east, Bromley to the south, Lewisham to the west and across the River Thames to the north lie Tower Hamlets, Newham and Barking and Dagenham.

==Governance==
The local authority is Greenwich Council, which meets at Woolwich Town Hall and has its main offices at the adjoining Woolwich Centre.

Shaped like an astrolabe, the 18-carat gold badge on the mayor&#x27;s chain depicts the time-ball on the principal building of the old Greenwich Royal Observatory, the meridian line, and lines of latitude and longitude. The ‘time-ball’ is set with small rubies.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Greenwich and Lewisham constituency.

===UK parliament===
The borough contains the constituencies of:
* Eltham
* Erith and Thamesmead (shared with the London Borough of Bexley)
* Greenwich and Woolwich

All three have represented by Labour MPs continuously since the 1997 General Election.

==Demographics==

The borough&#x27;s population in 2011 was 254,557. 52.3% of the community defined themselves as White British. The largest minority groups represented were of Black and Asian heritage.

Evidence of the tourism boom included the construction of a 452-room InterContinental Hotel near the O2 Arena (opening in 2015). Apart from the many museums and historic buildings in Greenwich town and Greenwich Park, the main tourist attractions are the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, The O2 Arena, the London Cable Car, Eltham Palace (which expected over 100,000 visitors in 2015), Charlton House and the Thames Barrier.

==Coat of arms==

Arms were originally granted to the London Borough by letters patent dated 1 October 1965. Although much of the 1965 design has been retained, the arms have been altered in 2012 by the addition of a representation of the Thames. In addition a crest and supporters were added to the arms.


==Twinning==
The Royal Borough of Greenwich is twinned with:
* Reinickendorf, Berlin, Germany (since 1965). The initiative of the twinning with this Berlin borough dates from the times of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. A London telephone box and a red pillar box beside Lake Tegel were gifted by Greenwich borough. A Berlin Buddy Bear in General Gordon Square (Woolwich) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the twinning.
* Maribor, Slovenia (since 1966). The 50th anniversary of the town twinning with Slovenia&#x27;s second largest city was celebrated with a ballet performance in Woolwich Town Hall and the revealing of a plaque in the renamed Maribor Park in the Royal Arsenal.
* Tema, Ghana (since 2000). The town twinning with Tema has led to the opening of Tema&#x27;s first Information Technology Centre (by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2000), the gifting of a mobile ICT learning centre to Tema (2005), the shipping of a converted Greenwich council passenger services bus, packed with books for school libraries and second-hand computers, as well as regular youth exchanges between Greenwich and Tema.

<text>Crayford is a town and electoral ward in South East London, England, within the London Borough of Bexley. It lies east of Bexleyheath and north west of Dartford. Crayford was in the historic county of Kent until 1965. The settlement developed by the river Cray, around a ford that is no longer used.

==History==
An Iron Age settlement existed in the vicinity of the present St Paulinus Church between the Julian and Claudian invasions of Britain, from roughly 30 BC to AD 40. Roman ruins have been discovered and Crayford is one of several places proposed as the site of Noviomagus Cantiacorum, a place mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary as being on the Roman equivalent of the later Watling Street. Crayford is also plausible as the site of the bloody battle of Crecganford (&quot;Creeksford&quot;) in 457 in which Hengist defeated Vortimer to become the supreme sovereign of Kent. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle written around 400 years later describes how Hengist and Æsc defeated the &quot;Brettas&quot; at that battle.

Crayford is mentioned in the Domesday Book, which was compiled just prior to 1086, as a settlement within the Hundred of Litlelee with a church, three mills, and a relatively large population of 27 regular householders (villeins) and two smallholders. Its overlord was not a private individual or the king but Christ Church, Canterbury.

As a (civil/combined) parish (before 1920) it included the hamlets of Northend, Perry Street and Slade Green which lie to the north. In 1831, the population of the parish was 2022 people. For centuries it was strongly associated with brick-making, the printing of silk scarves, ties and calico cloths, and for a short period carpet-making.

There were two main Manor Houses in the area during the Middle Ages, Newbery Manor on the site of what is now Crayford Manor House, and Howbury Manor next to Slade Green. Roger Apylton had served Kings Henry V and Henry VI as auditor, and resided at Marshalls Court, Crayford. Late in the reign of Elizabeth I Henry Partich sold Newbery Manor to Henry Apylton of Marshalls Court, and Apylton built May Place close by. Hall Place, which lies alongside the River Cray, was built for Lord Mayor of the City of London Sir John Champneis in around 1537. There was also an Iron Mill, which was later replaced by a saw mill (in 1765), which produced the timber for the floor of Buckingham Palace. In 1551 Francis Goldsmith bought a &#x27;Great tenement called The Place&#x27; next to the bridge in Crayford, and between 1556 and 1586 purchased substantial amounts of local farmland and the Old Bell Public House.

In 1623 most of the parish of Crayford was purchased by Merchant Taylor Robert Draper including Newbery Manor, Howbury Manor, Marshalls Court and May Place, where his family took up residence. Draper&#x27;s wife Anne was the daughter of Thomas Harman who lived at Ellam House which subsequently passed to the Drapers. The ownerships subsequently passed to Robert Draper&#x27;s son William, who was selected to be the Sheriff of the County of Kent but died in 1650 before taking office, and then to Robert&#x27;s grandson, parliamentarian Cresheld Draper. On the death of Cresheld Draper in 1694, his heirs sold all the properties to Sir Cloudesley Shovell&#x27;.

Crayford Manor House was rebuilt in the eighteenth century, at the time essentially a farmhouse until it was remodelled in 1816 for the Rev. Thomas Barne. Historic England state it was built piecemeal over several periods, with a porch and Italianate features being added to the 1816 building.

Other notable 19th-century local houses included Shenstone (built around 1828 and demolished 1974, the site is now Shenstone School, with Shenstone&#x27;s former grounds now being Shenstone Park), Stoneyhurst (which became Stoneyhurst Convent High School and is now the site of St Catherine&#x27;s Roman Catholic School for Girls), Martens Grove and Oakwood - the latter two designed by architect John Shaw Jr. and built by George Locke of builders Locke &amp; Nesham with each occupying one of the houses.

===Industrialisation===
In 1819, the former saw mill site became a flour mill. Another major employer was the silk works set up by Augustus Applegath and later run by David Evans. The Maxim Nordenfeldt Gun and Ammunition Factory was also a major employer, until taken over by the Vickers Company in 1897. Vickers built military aeroplanes and armaments and became the dominant employer, building homes, a theatre and a canteen close to many workshops. The canteen (built during the First World War) was converted for use by the Crayford Urban District Council as Crayford Town Hall and is a locally listed building.

Another former major employer in Crayford was Dussek Brothers (part of Burmah-Castrol since the 1960s) who operated their oils and waxes blending business on Thames Road from around 1928 until the site was bought by BP and subsequently closed down in 2001. The entire site was demolished in early 2010. The David Evans silk works is another recent closure, in 2002.

In 1982 a housing cooperative was built at Craymill next to the A206 road.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 census, 84% of the population is White British.

==Leisure==
Crayford has a theatre and a greyhound racing track. The theatre was named in honour of Geoffrey Whitworth who played a key part in developing a British tradition of amateur drama and in building political support for The Royal National Theatre. The new Crayford Community Centre, located above the library, is the venue for many groups.

Nearby Hall Place is a scheduled monument lying between Crayford and Bexley. It has gardens with the River Cray running through and a plant nursery, a cafe and restaurant plus the silkworks shop.

The large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket situated next to the greyhound stadium was claimed by Sainsbury&#x27;s to be the world first&#x27;s use of technology which heats the store using natural energy captured through boreholes buried hundreds of metres beneath the ground and was at the time of its expansion (2010) the largest Sainsbury&#x27;s in England.

The Tower Retail Park is opposite Crayford Town Hall.

The High Street is partly one-way for motor traffic.

<text>Bagoas (; , ; died 336 BCE) was a prominent Persian official who served as the vizier (Chief Minister) of the Achaemenid Empire until his death.

== Biography ==
Bagoas was a eunuch who later became vizier to Artaxerxes III. In this role, he allied himself with the Rhodian mercenary general Mentor, and with his help succeeded in once again making Egypt a province of the Achaemenids, probably from 342 BCE. Mentor became general of the maritime provinces, suppressed the rebels in Egypt and sent Greek mercenaries to the king, while Bagoas administered the satrapies and gained such power that he was almost the real master of the Empire towards the end of Artaxerxes III&#x27;s reign (Diod. xvi. 50; cf. Didymus, &quot;Comm. in Demosth. Phil.&quot; vi. 5).

Arses of Persia was the youngest son of Artaxerxes III and Atossa and was not expected to succeed to the throne. His unexpected rise to the throne came in 338 BCE as a result of the death of his father, who, according to the Greek work of Diodorus Siculus, was poisoned along with most of his family by Bagoas with the assistance of a physician, when the vizier fell out of favour with him. A cuneiform tablet in the British Museum (BM 71537), however, suggests Artaxerxes III died from natural causes.

Bagoas sought to remain in office by replacing Artaxerxes with his son, Arses (Artaxerxes IV), whom he thought easier to control. Arses remained little more than a puppet-king during the two years of his reign while Bagoas acted as the power behind the throne. Eventually, disgruntled by this state of affairs and possibly influenced by the nobles of the Royal Court, who generally held Bagoas in contempt, Arses started planning Bagoas&#x27; murder. However, Bagoas again acted first in order to protect himself and managed to poison and kill Arses. Bagoas then raised a cousin of Arses to the throne as Darius III. 

When Darius attempted to become independent of the powerful vizier, Bagoas tried to poison him too; but Darius was warned and forced Bagoas to drink the poison himself (Diod. xvii. 5; Johann. Antioch, p. 38, 39 ed. Müller; Arrian ii. 14. 5; Curt. vi. 4. 10).

According to the &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; by Diodorus Siculus, Bagoas became very wealthy by confiscating the sacred writings of the Egyptian temples and giving them back to the priests for large bribes (Diod. XVI. 51). When the high priest of Jerusalem, Johannes, murdered his brother Jesus in the temple, Bagoas (who had supported Jesus) put a new tax on the Jews and entered the temple, saying that he was purer than he who was murdered in the temple (Joseph. Ant. xi. 7.1).

A later story, that Bagoas was an Egyptian and killed Artaxerxes III because he had killed the living Apis (Aelian, &quot;Var. Hist.&quot; vi. 8), is without historical basis.

Bagoas&#x27; house in Susa, with rich treasures, was presented by Alexander the Great to Parmenion (Plut. &quot;Alex.&quot; 39); his gardens in Babylon, with the best species of palms, are mentioned by Theophrastus (&quot;Hist. Plant&quot;, ii. 6; Plin. &quot;Nat. Hist.&quot; xiii. 41).

Plutarch reports an angry letter from Alexander to Darius, naming Bagoas as one of the persons who organized the murder of his father, Philip II of Macedon.

==In fiction==
*Bagoas is featured as a character in the ancient Greek novel &quot;Aethiopica&quot; by Heliodorus of Emesa. In the novel, he is portrayed as a trusty eunuch servant of the Persian satrap of Memphis. In the course of events, he is captured by the Ethiopian king and assimilated as a servant in the Ethiopian court.
* Bagoas is mentioned in Mary Renault&#x27;s novel &quot;The Persian Boy&quot; as the cause of the narrator&#x27;s enslavement and castration.

<text>Cricklewood is a town in North London, England, in the London Boroughs of Camden, Barnet, and Brent. The Crown pub, now the Clayton Crown Hotel, is a local landmark and lies north-west of Charing Cross.

Cricklewood was a small rural hamlet around Edgware Road, the Roman road which was later called Watling Street and which forms the boundary of the two boroughs that share Cricklewood. The area urbanised after the arrival of the surface and underground railways in nearby Willesden Green in the 1870s. The shops on Cricklewood Broadway, as Edgware Road is known here, contrast with quieter surrounding streets of largely late-Victorian, Edwardian, and 1930s housing. The area has strong links with Ireland due to a sizeable Irish population. The Gladstone Park lies on the area&#x27;s western periphery.

Cricklewood has two conservation areas, the Mapesbury Estate and the Cricklewood Railway Terraces, and in 2012 was awarded £1.65 million from the Mayor of London&#x27;s office to improve the area.

==History==

===Origin and setting===
The small settlement at the junction of Cricklewood Lane and the Edgware Road was established by 1294, which by 1321 was called Cricklewood. The settlement took its name from a nearby wood, perhaps on Cricklewood Lane, in Hendon. The name of the wood may be a tautology meaning &quot;hill hill wood&quot;, with the Common Brittonic word &quot;cruc&quot; (meaning hill) forming the first element, and the Old English &quot;hyll&quot; (also meaning hill) the second element.

The area of the hamlet east of Watling street was in the Ancient Parish of Hendon (now part of Barnet), and the area to the west was in the Ancient Parish of Willesden (now part of Brent). 

By the 1750s the Crown (rebuilt in 1889) was providing for coach travellers, and by the 1800s it had a handful of cottages and Cricklewood House as neighbours, and was known for its &quot;pleasure gardens&quot;. By the 1860s there were a number of substantial villas along the Edgware Road starting with Rockhall Lodge.

===Urban development east of Edgware Road===
Childs Hill and Cricklewood station, later renamed Cricklewood, opened in 1868. In the summer of 1881 the Midland Railway Company moved its locomotive works from Kentish Town to the new &quot;Brent Sidings&quot;, and in October of the same year it was announced that new accommodation for its workers would be built, later the now-listed Railway Cottages. Mr H. Finch laid out a handful of streets directly behind the Crown Inn, (including Yew, Ash and Elm Groves) in 1880. The station had become the terminus for the Midland Railway suburban services by 1884. The census of 1881 showed that the population had grown enough for a new church, and St. Peter&#x27;s replaced a tin chapel in 1891. A daughter church called Little St. Peter&#x27;s was opened in 1958 on Claremont Way but closed in 1983. The parish church on Cricklewood Lane was demolished and rebuilt in the 1970s. This church building was closed in 2004. Services for Anglicans were then held in the Carey Hall on Claremont Road (which is the church hall of Claremont Free Church) but were discontinued there in December 2015. The London General Omnibus Company commenced services to Regent Street from the Crown in 1883, and in 1899 opened a bus garage (Garage code W), which is still in use and was completely rebuilt in 2010.

By the 1890s, houses and shops had been built along part of Cricklewood Lane. Cricklewood Broadway had become a retail area by 1900 replacing the Victorian villas. The Queens Hall Cinema, later the Gaumont, replaced Rock Hall House, and was itself demolished in 1960. Thorverton, Caddington and Dersingham Roads were laid out in 1907, the year of the opening of Golders Green Underground station.

Cowhouse Farm, latterly Dicker&#x27;s Farm and finally Avenue Farm, was closed in 1932. From 1908 to 1935, Westcroft Farm was owned by the Home of Rest for Horses; at its peak it could house 250 horses. The Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead opened the Westcroft Estate in 1935.

===Urban development west of Edgware Road===
Much of the land to the west of Edgware Road was part of the estate of All Souls College, Oxford. Much of the land was wooded and in 1662 there were 79 oaks in Cricklewood. The transformation of the area came with the opening of the underground station in Willesden Green in 1879, which was known as Willesden Green and Cricklewood station from 1894 to 1938.

A number of developers acquired land in the area and built houses in the 1890s and 1900s. George Furness laid out what he called Cricklewood Park between 1893 and 1900 on Clock Farm. Roads in the area are named after trees (Pine, Larch, Cedar, Ivy, Olive). The name Cricklewood Park is no longer used. To the south of this, Henry Corsellis built Rockhall, Oaklands and Howard Roads from 1894; at the time he was also building in the Lavender Hill and Clapham Common area in Wandsworth. All Souls&#x27; College built a group of roads named after fellows of the college; for example, Chichele Road is named after Henry Chichele, founder of All Souls&#x27; College. Further expansion westward was blocked by the Dollis Hill estate, which became a public park, Gladstone Park, in 1901. To the north of Furness&#x27;s Cricklewood Park Estate, Earl Temple built Temple Road by 1906 and surrounding roads. To the south, the Mapesbury Estate was built mainly between 1895 and 1905 and is a Conservation Area of largely semi-detached and detached houses.

===Industrial history===
With the introduction of the tram system in 1904, and the motorisation of bus services by 1911, numerous important industries were established. The first of these was the Phoenix Telephone Company in 1911 (later moved to the Hyde). The Handley Page Aircraft Company soon followed, from 1912 until 1917, at 110 Cricklewood Lane and subsequently occupying a large part of Claremont Road. The Cricklewood Aerodrome adjacent to their factory was used for the first London-Paris air service in the 1920s.

The former aircraft factory was converted into Cricklewood Studios in 1920, the largest film studio in the country at the time. It became the production base for Stoll Pictures during the silent era. After later turning out a number of quota quickies, it closed down in 1938. Some years later, the property was redeveloped and currently hosts a Wickes DIY store.

A number of plans were drawn up around the turn of the 20th century to extend the developing London Underground network to Cricklewood. Several proposals were put forward to construct an underground railway tunnel under the length of the Edgware Road, including an unusual scheme to build a type of subterranean monorail roller-coaster, but these proposals were abandoned.

Cricklewood was home to Smith&#x27;s Industries. This started in 1915 as S. Smith &amp; Sons, on the Edgware Road, established to manufacture fuses, instruments and accessories. By 1939 it was making electrical motors, aircraft accessories and electric clocks. The large advertisement on the iron railway bridge over the Broadway next to the bus garage became a familiar landmark for decades. As the company grew it acquired other companies and sites overseas but Cricklewood remained the most important site, with 8,000 employees between 1937 and 1978. Coincidentally, Cricklewood also became the home for the first Smith&#x27;s Crisps potato crisp factory, which replaced the omnibus depot at Crown Yard. Having moved into new premises in Cricklewood Lane, the yard was taken over by Clang Electrical Goods Ltd. From 1929 to 1933 the area was finally built over. Bentley Motors, builders of racing and sports cars, built a factory at Oxgate Lane in 1920, and Cricklewood remained the company&#x27;s headquarters until it was bought out by Rolls-Royce in 1931.

From the 1960s, industry in the local area went into decline, and all the above-mentioned businesses have left.


There were two notable buildings on Cricklewood Lane, one of which survives. The first was Production Village, part of the British film-making scene and owned by Samuelson&#x27;s, which towards the end was a pub with rehearsal rooms attached. On the same site was Clang&#x27;s electrical from 1929 to the mid-1970s. Production Village was demolished in 2000, andn became a Virfgin Active Gym, in 2022 it became a David Lloyd Gym. Secondly, and a little further up the hill on the south side of the road, is a modern building, which was the factory that manufactured the revolutionary Stylophone handheld organ of the late-1960s to early-1970s – as demonstrated by Rolf Harris.

In June 2001, a lynx was captured in Cricklewood after 10 years of sightings by residents. The animal was originally nicknamed the &quot;Beast of Barnet&quot; by the local press following numerous sightings of a similarly sized animal around south Hertfordshire and the fringes of north London. A senior veterinary officer for the London Zoological Society arrived with the task of sedating the beast using a tranquilliser gun. It is believed that someone was keeping the animal illegally and it had escaped. The lynx was taken to London Zoo and named Lara.

===Recent developments===
Brent Cross Cricklewood, a £4.5 billion regeneration scheme for Cricklewood, Brent Cross and West Hendon was approved in October 2010, and was expected to start in 2014. A new Brent Cross Thameslink station, for 12-car trains, is planned, and for that reason the planned lengthening of Cricklewood station platforms, from 8 to 12-cars, has been abandoned. West Hendon is now being dealt with separately. This is currently the largest planned development scheme in London.

The approval was delayed for several years as there were views for and against the proposals. These developments were reported in the media.

In April 2009, the London Borough of Camden decided to oppose the application. In May 2009, the London Borough of Brent concluded, although without widespread public pronouncement, that the developers needed to apply for planning permission from Brent as well as from Barnet, because of various road changes that spilled over on to Brent land. On 15 September 2009, Barnet recommended approval of the application, in a report to its 23 September Planning Committee, later postponed to 20 October. The issue was reported by local media, and was taken up by the national media.

==Attractions and amenities==
The Mapesbury Dell on Hoveden Road is a small park and garden administered by local residents. It started in 2000 when local residents in conjunction with the Mapesbury Residents Association decided that their local green space was too valuable to leave to fortune. The dell is open to the public during daylight hours and is used throughout the year, for example hosting carol services in mid-December.

Gladstone Park marks the north-western edge, covering approximately . In 2003–04, Gladstone Park features and facilities were improved/restored with the aid of Heritage Lottery funding. The park contains a well maintained formal garden, children&#x27;s playground, art gallery, café and pond, as well as good sport facilities (football/rugby/cricket pitches and tennis and netball courts). Barring fog and rain its peak gives good views of Wembley Stadium, the London Eye and the Shard. The park was frequented by Mark Twain around the turn of the 20th century whilst staying in accompanying Dollis Hill House, about which altogether he said he had &quot;never seen any place that was so satisfactorily situated, with its noble trees and stretch of country, and everything that went to make life delightful, and all within a biscuit&#x27;s throw of the metropolis of the world&quot;.

The historic Crown pub is a terracotta, grade two listed Victorian building on Cricklewood Broadway, built by the architects Shoebridge &amp; Rising in 1899. It was fully restored in 2003, and reopened as the Crown Moran Hotel and with the addition of a 152-room 4 star hotel and restaurant (Kitchen at the Crown). Later, the hotel was renamed the Clayton Crown Hotel. The building style has been described as: &quot;Free Flemish Renaissance, with two stepped and voluted gables in front of a slate mansard roof, a battlement turret at one end. Plentiful terracotta ornament; four handsome cast-iron lamp standards in front.&quot;

Another notable local building is the Cricklewood Baptist Church on Anson Road at the Junction with Sneyd Road. The church was built in 1907 of red and yellow brick in the Italian Byzantine style. Other local churches include St Gabriel&#x27;s Church on Walm Lane; Claremont Free Church on Cheviot Gardens/Claremont Road built in 1931; and St. Agnes&#x27; Roman Catholic Church built in 1883 on Cricklewood Lane.
St. Agnes&#x27; Catholic Primary school is next door and both cater for the large Catholic population of the area.

Cricklewood Pumping Station built in 1905 is another distinctive building, the interior of which was used as a double for the &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s engine rooms of the 1997 film, &quot;Titanic&quot;.
==Local groups and associations==
In June 2012, Cricklewood Town Team was awarded £1.67 million from the Mayor of London&#x27;s Outer London Fund to boost the local high street, deliver growth, new jobs and improve lives. In addition to physical improvements to the area the funds also enabled the running costs of the annual summer and pre-Christmas winter festivals until 2017. The OMG comedy club was inaugurated at the same time to contribute to the local cultural scene.

There are several residents&#x27; associations in the area: the NorthWestTwo Residents Association, the Mapesbury Residents Association, the Groves Residents Association and the Railway Cottages Association. A group of local artists set up a group called Creative Cricklewood. The Clitterhouse Farm Project are a local group working to save and restore the historic Clitterhouse Farm outbuildings on the corner of Clitterhouse Playing Fields on Claremont Road as a resource for promoting culture and community in a sustainable society.

<doc id="93957" wikidata="Q1992321" url="?curid=93957" title="Crofton Park">
<text>Crofton Park is a mainly residential suburb and electoral ward in the London Borough of Lewisham.

It is the original site of the former agricultural hamlet of Brockley. It is located south east of Charing Cross, and is south of Brockley and north of Honor Oak. Major points of interest include the Rivoli Ballroom, the Brockley Jack Theatre and the Arts and Crafts Gothic church of St Hilda.

Crofton Park Ward is bordered by Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries to the north, and Garthorne Road Nature Reserve in the west with the London to Brighton railway running along the western boundary of the ward and a section of Ladywell Fields to the south east. The area also offers easy access to South East London Green Chain of walks. Nearby, between Honor Oak and Catford, is Blythe Hill Fields, one of a number of hills in south east London and which provide good views of Canary Wharf and the City of London.

==History==

Before the area was built in the late 19th century, the principal buildings were Brockley Farm, Brockley Hall, and the Brockley Jack public house. The area expanded rapidly in the 1890s with the opening of a new railway line (informally known as the Catford Loop) and railway station which opened in 1892. It was the naming of the station as Crofton Park which gave the area its modern and invented name. Despite this being the historic heart of Brockley, that name had already been used for two earlier railway stations further north – Brockley Station and Brockley Lane Station.

The rapid pace of expansion of the area continued pre-First World War, with the building of more shops and facilities to support the growing population. &quot;The London Encyclopaedia&quot; describes this development as: &quot;a mixture of terrace houses for &#x27;clerkly classes&#x27; and local authority flats and houses.&quot; A handsome Edwardian public library was built next to the railway station in 1905 and, eight years later, a local cinema – the Crofton Park Picture Palace – first opened its doors. This later became the Rivoli Ballroom.

===Brockley Hall===
Brockley Hall, a large private residence, stood on land to the west of the road which now bears its name. The property had a somewhat obscure history. There was a house on the site before 1745 and probably long before that date. It was the most associated with its final owners, the Noakes family who lived there. The Noakes were brewers and their ales were sold in many local pubs, including The Brockley Jack which they owned and was just across the road from Brockley Hall. The Hall&#x27;s lodge stood in Brockley Grove on the approximate site of what are now the front gardens of nos. 24–28.

The 1901 census returns show Bertram Noakes as head of the household living in Brockley Hall with his five spinster sisters (Pauline, Elizabeth, Kate, Ada and Maude) and four servants. Lewisham Arhive&#x27;s photograph of the Hall suggests at one time it was called Noakes Farm.

Maude Noakes was the last survivor. An eccentric, she was well known for her large collection of pets. The old lady would bury her pets in the grounds of Brockley Hall and give each one a marked gravestone – even her pigs and cows.

Following Maude&#x27;s death in April 1931 the property was quickly sold and demolished. Brockley Hall Road, Bearsted Rise, Horsmonden Road, Sevenoaks Road and the 1930s houses in Brockley Grove were built on the site of the Hall and its grounds by the building company Wates.

===The Second World War===
In common with many areas of London, Crofton Park was damaged during the Second World War, particularly by V1 flying bombs and V2 rockets, with the area north of Crofton Park Station on Brockley Road suffering many strikes. A V1 &#x27;doodlebug&#x27; hit on the evening of 18 June 1944 destroyed Brockley Road School and killed five members of the Crofton Park Home Guard. The men are commemorated by a plaque in St Hilda&#x27;s Church.

==Notable buildings==
===Brockley Jack===

The Brockley Jack was formerly a picturesque timber-framed building and one of the earliest landmarks in Crofton Park. It was described by &quot;The London Encyclopaedia&quot; as: &quot;a curious, rambling hostelry, reputedly the haunt of highwaymen&quot;.

For much of the 18th century it was known as &#x27;The Crooked Billet&#x27;, for much of the 19th century &#x27;The Castle&#x27;.

The old Brockley Jack was one of the most photographed pubs in South East London. It was a long, low building with a bay window looking onto the front garden. It had been extended and altered many times during its long history. In the garden were rows of seats and tables beneath old trees, and a large but almost branchless tree stump carrying the pub&#x27;s sign board. The sign was written on a whale&#x27;s shoulder blade.

A contemporary account, recorded at about the time of the building&#x27;s demolition states: &quot;A penthouse on one side sheltered some of the seats and on the other side was a staircase leading to the upper floor of an annex built at right angles to the main building... Within, the rooms are dark with low-pitched ceilings and redolent of beer and tobacco, of which is added the flavour of antiquity from ancient walls and beams.&quot;

The association with highwaymen is also cited in the account which continues: &quot;There was a particular staircase so constructed that it could be removed at night, and thus cut off access to the upper storey, in case of criminals being secreted there.&quot; The film star comedian Will Hay recalled the old &quot;Brockley Jack&quot; in his unfinished autobiography, &quot;I Enjoyed Every Minute&quot;:

&quot;Almost at the corner of the street was romance in the shape of a very old inn, several hundred years old, The Brockley Jack, a reputed haunt and &#x27;pull up&#x27; for highwaymen including the famous Dick Turpin. I remember the place quite well – small rooms with the ceiling so low that even a man of ordinary height couldn&#x27;t stand upright. Alas, the romance didn&#x27;t long survive on arrival within the district for the place was condemned and pulled down to make way for a modern building.&quot;

A 2005 Radio 4 edition of &quot;Making History&quot; explored the history of Brockley Jack and found that the pub dated to at least 1810 and was close to areas notorious for robberies of travellers. However, the programme concluded that local legends about a highwayman called Brockley Jack may have been later embroidery to drum up business.

Brockley Jack, now a Greene King tied pub, was rebuilt as a more substantial structure of brick and stone in 1898. Its foundation stone was laid by Wickham Noakes. A representation of a whale&#x27;s shoulderblade hangs on a high gable outside the front of the Jack. The real whale&#x27;s shoulderblade (on which was once the pub&#x27;s sign) is exhibited above the fireplace to the right of the bar.

===St Hilda&#x27;s Church===

Situated in Stondon Park, St Hilda&#x27;s Church dates from 1907 and was designed by F H Greenaway and J E Newberry. The Grade II listed building is constructed of Crowborough brick with Chilmark stone dressings and is a fine example of Arts and Crafts ideas superimposed onto Gothic church design. Its English Heritage listing describes it as one of the best Edwardian churches in London. It has been described by the architectural historian Gavin Stamp as one of two &quot;remarkable and inventive buildings&quot; which distinguish this part of South London, the other building being the Horniman Museum at Forest Hill.

The church hall adjacent to the current church was its forerunner and originally served as a mission hall. Designed by J E Newberry, it is also Grade II listed.

The war memorial in front of the church is in the form of a granite Celtic cross and is inscribed with 141 names of the fallen. It was unveiled on 29 May 1920 by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by the Bishop Suffragan of Woolwich. A woman is listed among the names – Rosabelle Stanley, a nursing sister.

===Library===
Crofton Park Library, originally known as Brockley Branch Library, was opened in October 1905 to serve the expanding local population. It is a Carnegie library. Its architect was Alfred L Guy, ARIBA, and it was constructed by F J Gortham of Greenwich. The library is of an eclectic Edwardian free-style composition. Its entrance facade is dominated by a broad Dutch gable and an octagonal tower with a domed roof. The building sustained damage when the neighbouring Crofton Park Station was bombed in 1940 and 1945, losing two glass dome skylights and the leaded glass in the ground floor windows. The library was refurbished in 1959–60. The library building has been given local listing by Lewisham Borough Council, which describes it as making &quot;a handsome contribution towards the streetscape&quot;.

In 2011, the library was outsourced by the council to be run as a Community run model, by Eco Computer Systems, now renamed Eco Communities. The library takes computer and book donations to help with the running costs of the building. The library is staffed by volunteers which meant unlike the Council run libraries it was closed for much of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, finally reopening in April 2021.

==Cultural life and leisure==
===Brockley Jack Theatre===

When the rebuilt Brockley Jack pub opened in 1898, it had a large function room at the rear of the building. The room has been used variously as a dance hall, a snooker room and a music venue, and by the 1980s, as nothing much at all. A small group of local actors, David Kincaid, Peter Rocca and Michael Bottle, hit upon the idea of staging dramatic productions in this back room. So, in 1993, the first of these ventures took place: &#x27;An evening with Chekhov&#x27;, featuring two one-handers, &#x27;On the harmfulness of tobacco&#x27; and &#x27;Swan Song&#x27;. David and Michael starred and Peter directed.

There was no finance and virtually no facilities but the short run proved a big success, especially with local people.

Gradually, finance was secured and with the help of the brewery, Greene King, the room has been transformed over the years into the vibrant little theatre, fully equipped, that it now is. It has now become a hub of local creativity, staging plays as diverse as &#x27;Julius Caesar&#x27;, &#x27;Of Mice and Men&#x27;, &#x27;She Stoops to Conquer&#x27; and &#x27;Lilies&#x27;. New writing is fostered by in regular workshops, part of the &#x27;Write Now Festival&#x27;. Artistic Director Kate Bannister and Theatre Manager Karl Swinyard were awarded Best Venue Directors in the Fringe Report Awards 2011.
For more details, see the Brockley Jack Theatre website.

===Rivoli Ballroom===

Originally built as Crofton Park Picture Palace in 1913, the early cinema was renamed the Rivoli in 1929 and subsequently turned into a ballroom. It has a beautifully conserved interior which largely dates from the 1950s, although the Brockley Road elevation dates from 1931 and the barrel-vaulted ballroom ceiling (originally the cinema auditorium) is also earlier.

It was saved from development as a block of flats after English Heritage gave it a Grade II listing in 2007. A feature in &quot;Country Life&quot; described it as: &quot;the best dance space in the country&quot;.

The English Heritage listing rests largely on the Rivoli&#x27;s 1950s makeover, describing it as a: &quot;luxuriant, exotic and deeply theatrical&quot; interior, little altered since 1960. Its listing notes that it has special historic interest as witness to the important dance trends of the 1950s and &#x27;60s – also noting that attending a dance at Rivoli Ballroom is listed in Time Out&#x27;s list of 101 things to do in London.

In 2012, it was included in a feature in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about London&#x27;s hidden interiors. Described as a popular location of music, fashion and TV shoots because of its kitsch and authentic interior, the article also notes: &quot;There is nothing quite like it anywhere else in London.&quot;

It maintains a lively calendar of events, including cabaret, dance competitions and themed evenings, including tea dances, and Jackie&#x27;s Juke Box, a mixed gay/straight night every month which regularly attracts between 200 and 300 people.

==Transport==
The area has a network of rail and bus services, with connections to central London and Kent.

===National Rail===
Crofton Park Station opened in July 1892. It is served by Thameslink services to London Blackfriars (for the South Bank and Bankside), (for the City and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral), Farringdon (which will connect with the Crossrail network) and St Pancras International (for Channel Tunnel services). In the southbound direction the service links to Catford, Bromley and Sevenoaks. Disabled access entrances to Crofton Park station were opened from Marnock and Lindal Road in 2008. The station ticket office is open every weekday morning, and an automatic Metro ticket machine is also available.

The South London Rail Utilisation Strategy published by Network Rail in March 2008 proposed improvements to rail services along the Catford loop line (through Crofton Park). These include four stopping Thameslink services per hour at this station, and a Victoria to Bellingham service to provide additional trains per hour.

There are three other train stations within a ten to 15-minute walk of Crofton Park Station: Brockley railway station, Honor Oak Park and Ladywell.

 and stations provide rail links to London Bridge, London Victoria, , Highbury &amp; Islington, Crystal Palace, Sydenham, East and West Croydon and Caterham. Both stations are served by Southern and since 2010 London Overground services.

===Bus===
A number of bus services operate throughout the area providing links to the West End/The city. Services include:
* 171 – Bellingham Catford to Holborn (via Peckham, Elephant and Castle, and Waterloo)
* N171 – Bellingham Catford to Tottenham Court Road bus station
* 172 – Brockley Rise to St Paul&#x27;s (via Old Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, and Waterloo)
* 122 – Crystal Palace to Plumstead
* P4 – Brixton Station to Lewisham Station (via Dulwich Village)
* 284 – Lewisham Station to Grove Park

==Local government==
Crofton Park electoral ward includes part of the Honor Oak Park area and is one of 18 wards in the London Borough of Lewisham. It is currently represented by two Labour councillors and one Liberal Democrat who were elected on 6 May 2010 when the general election and London Borough elections took place on the same day.

Across Lewisham, Labour gained heavily from the other parties, taking the council from no overall control to a Labour majority of 24 seats. The Liberal Democrats lost a net of five seats, Crofton Park ward being the party&#x27;s only gain from Labour anywhere in London. This change was put down to the rapid gentrification of the local area.

==Schools==
The in the years 2007–2008 renovated Crofton School – now renamed Prendergast Ladywell School – is the main secondary school in the area and is located on Manwood Road. The area has a number of primary schools, including:
* Beecroft Garden Primary School (formerly known as Brockley Primary School) which was rebuilt in 2011–12
* Stillness Infant And Junior Schools in Brockley Rise

==Health==
Healthcare for the area is commissioned by Lewisham CCG. There is a modern teaching hospital a short walk away. There are two pharmacies in the area, as well as a local opticians

==Football Team==
Crofton Park Football Club was formed in May 2007 and is the area&#x27;s local side.

==Famous residents==
* Jim Connell (1852–1929), writer of the anthem, &quot;The Red Flag&quot;, lived close to St Hilda&#x27;s Church at 22A Stondon Park. A maroon commemorative plaque was unveiled there by Lewisham Council in February 1989.
* British film, radio and music hall comedian Will Hay (1888–1949) lived at 7 Eddystone Road and later 40 Merritt Road, Crofton Park as a child in the late 1890s. He also attended the nearby Brockley Primary School (now renamed Beecroft Garden Primary School).
* Irish comedian Spike Milligan (1918–2002) lived at 50 Riseldine Road (which is on the Crofton Park side of Honor Oak) in the late 1930s, a few years after coming to England from India. A silver birch tree has been planted in his memory in front of Crofton Park Library.

<doc id="93958" wikidata="Q730706" url="?curid=93958" title="London Borough of Southwark">
<text>The London Borough of Southwark ( ) in South London forms part of Inner London and is connected by bridges across the River Thames to the City of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was created in 1965 when three smaller council areas were amalgamated under the London Government Act 1963. All districts of the area are within the London postal district. It is governed by Southwark London Borough Council.

The part of the South Bank within the borough is home to London Bridge terminus station and the attractions of The Shard, Tate Modern, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe and Borough Market that are the largest of the venues in Southwark to draw domestic and international tourism. Dulwich is home to the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the Imperial War Museum is in Elephant and Castle.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Suthriganaweorc&quot; or &quot;Suthringa geweorche&quot; is recorded for the place in the early 10th-century Anglo-Saxon document known as the &quot;Burghal Hidage&quot; and means &quot;Surrey folk&#x27;s fort&quot; or &quot;the defensive work of the men of Surrey&quot;. Southwark is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Sudweca&quot;. The name means &quot;southern defensive work&quot; and is formed from the Old English &quot;sūþ&quot; (south) and &quot;weorc&quot; (work). In Old English, Surrey means &quot;southern district (or the men of the southern district)&quot;, so the change from &quot;southern district work&quot; to the latter &quot;southern work&quot; may be an evolution based on the elision of the single syllable ge element, meaning district.

The strategic context of the defences would have been in relation to London, its bridge and preventing waterborne attackers from travelling further up the Thames.

==History==

Southwark is the oldest part of south London. An urban area to the south of the bridge was first developed in the Roman period, but subsequently abandoned. The name Southwark dates from the establishment of a defensive position in the area by King Alfred in the 9th century.

Southwark was an ancient borough, being described as a borough from at least the 12th century. The area historically formed part of the county of Surrey. Southwark had a complicated administrative relationship with the neighbouring City of London. There was a parliamentary borough (constituency) of Southwark from 1295 onwards. London was given various manorial and judicial rights over parts of Southwark, notably in 1327 and 1550, when Southwark was brought within the city boundaries as the ward of Bridge Without. However, the city&#x27;s authority over Southwark was not as complete as it was for the older part of the city north of the Thames; certain judicial powers over the borough were still exercised by the Surrey authorities.

From 1856 the area was also governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. The parishes of Bermondsey, Camberwell, Newington, Rotherhithe and Southwark St George the Martyr were governed by their individual vestries, whilst other smaller parishes and liberties were grouped into the St Olave District and St Saviour&#x27;s District.

In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs. Bermondsey, Rotherhithe and the St Olave District merged to become the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey, the parish of Camberwell was made the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell, and Newington, Southwark St George the Martyr, and the St Saviour&#x27;s District merged to become the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. The City of London&#x27;s Bridge Without ward which had covered parts of Southwark was effectively abolished as part of the reforms, losing all its territory.

The larger London Borough of Southwark was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former metropolitan boroughs of Southwark, Bermondsey and Camberwell.

==Geography==
The borough borders the City of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets to the north (the River Thames forming the boundary), the London Borough of Lambeth to the west and the London Borough of Lewisham to the east. To the south the borough tapers giving a brief border with the London Borough of Bromley.

The northwest part of the borough is part of Central London and is densely developed. To the east, the Rotherhithe peninsula has lower-density modern housing and open space around the former Surrey Commercial Docks. The southern part of Southwark includes the Victorian suburbs of Camberwell, Peckham and Nunhead, and the prosperous &quot;village&quot; of Dulwich with some very large houses forms the far south of the borough.

===Landmarks===
Tower Bridge, the Millennium Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and London Bridge all connect the City of London to the borough. The Tate Modern art gallery, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre, the Imperial War Museum and Borough Market are also within the borough. At wide, Burgess Park is Southwark&#x27;s largest green space.

===Hills and watercourses===
The Norwood Ridge, save for around its broad northern third, forms the borough&#x27;s boundary. Along these crests, against the extreme of the borough&#x27;s southern narrow taper, is the highest point of the borough, Sydenham Hill. This is the fifteenth-highest peak in London.

The main watercourse is the Thames bounding the north of the borough into which the area drains.

The southern of the borough is the valley catchment of a present sewerage and surface water drainage basin, once a large stream with complex mouths across the north of the borough, the Effra. It is in very large part converted to a combined sewer under a Joseph Bazalgette-engineered reform to enable general urbanisation; all combined and public foul sewers drain far to the east – to the Crossness works.

Similarly reformed, into all three types of drainage (foul, combined, surface), are the Neckinger and Peck catchments of the borough.

==Governance==
The local authority is Southwark Council, based at 160 Tooley Street.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the Lambeth and Southwark constituency.

===Westminster Parliament===
The borough is covered by three parliamentary constituencies. All three are currently represented by Labour MPs. (Neil Coyle was suspended from Labour on 11 February 2022, but re-admitted in May 2023, sitting in the interim as an independent.)
* Peckham – Miatta Fahnbulleh
* Dulwich and West Norwood (shared with London Borough of Lambeth) – Helen Hayes
* Bermondsey and Old Southwark – Neil Coyle
* Vauxhall and Camberwell Green - Florence Eshalomi

== Demographics ==

At the 2001 census Southwark had a population of 244,866. Southwark was ethnically 63.04% white, 5.9% Asian or Asian British, and 25.9% black or black British. By 2021 the population was 307,640, with 51.5% white, 9.9% Asian or Asian British, and 25.1% black or black British. 31% of householders were owner–occupiers.

The area is the home of many Nigerian (Peckham is largely regarded as the heart of London&#x27;s Nigerian community), Jamaican, South African, South American, Polish, and French immigrants.t

===Ethnicity===


=== Religion ===
According to the last census, Southwark was at the time about 50% Christian. It has many notable places of Christian worship and ceremony: Anglican, Roman Catholic and other denominations. These include Charles Spurgeon&#x27;s Metropolitan Tabernacle, Southwark Cathedral (Church of England), Saint George&#x27;s Cathedral (Roman Catholic), and Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (Greek Orthodox). London&#x27;s Norwegian Church, Finnish Church and the Swedish Seamen&#x27;s Church are all in Rotherhithe. Saint George the Martyr is the oldest church in London dedicated to England&#x27;s patron saint. Southwark has the most British-Nigerian churches in the country and the highest concentration of African churches outside the continent.

Places of worship for Sunni Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Jews exist.

Per the 2011 Census, 35.6% of the borough&#x27;s resident respondents identified as non-religious, or chose not to state their faith.

The following table shows the religious identity of residents residing in Southwark according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

==Repurposed places of worship==
Ex-St Thomas&#x27;s Church is the Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret. The other redundant church in public use is Francis Bedford&#x27;s in Trinity Church Square, as recording studio Henry Wood Hall.

== Literature and theatres ==

Southwark has many literary associations. Charles Dickens set several of his novels in the old borough where he lived as a young man. The site of The Tabard inn (featured in Chaucer&#x27;s Canterbury Tales), the White Hart inn and the George Inn which survives.

The rebuilt Globe Theatre and its exhibition on the Bankside remind us of the area&#x27;s being the birthplace of classical theatre. There is also the remains of the Rose Theatre. In 2007 the Unicorn Theatre for Children was opened on Tooley Street. The Southwark Playhouse is in Elephant and Castle and the Union Theatre is on Union Street near Southwark station. The Menier Chocolate Factory combines a theatre and exhibition space, whilst the newly opened Bridge Theatre is next to Tower Bridge and City Hall.

== Museums and galleries ==
The borough hosts the main site of the Imperial War Museum at the south end of Borough High Street.

Peckham Library, designed by Will Alsop won the Stirling Prize for modern architecture. Another architecturally innovative library designed by Piers Gough, Canada Water Library opened in 2011.

South London Gallery between Camberwell and Peckham is split across two buildings on Peckham Road. The Tate Modern is also based at Bankside. MOCA, London, as curated by the artist Michael Petry, and Flat Time House are both contemporary art galleries on Bellenden Road. Dulwich Picture Gallery also is in Dulwich. Bold Tendencies is an annual exhibition space in a former car park on Rye Lane in Peckham which has shown work by Simon Whybray, Jenny Holzer, Derek Jarman, Rene Matić, and Gray Wielebinski.

Another museum is the Old Operating Theatre.

One former museum include the Cuming Museum and the Livesey Museum for Children was a free children&#x27;s museum housed in the former Camberwell Public Library No.1, which was given to the people of Southwark by the industrialist Sir George Livesey. The museum was closed by Southwark council in 2008.

==Economy==

The northern end of the borough opposite the Square Mile includes the More London and London Bridge City developments accommodating the offices of major professional service firms. Notable such businesses include PricewaterhouseCoopers, Norton Rose, Ernst &amp; Young, Lawrence Graham and Actis. The Greater London Authority is based at City Hall.

The press and publishing industry is also well represented in Southwark; the &quot;Financial Times&quot; has its head office in Southwark Bridge Road, and IPC Magazines in Southwark Street. Campus Living Villages UK also has its head office in the borough.

Some of the old industrial and wharfside heritage remains at the now-defunct Surrey Commercial Docks now Surrey Quays, including Greenland Dock and Baltic Quay, where major residential schemes were developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Near Tower Bridge, old warehouses have been converted to new mixed uses at Butler&#x27;s Wharf and Hay&#x27;s Wharf. Similarly, further west, the Oxo Tower hosts restaurants, shops and housing.

There are major retail concentrations at Surrey Quays, Old Kent Road, Elephant &amp; Castle/Walworth Road and central Peckham.

Southwark is currently home to three Opportunity Areas (areas with capacity for significant economic development) as designated in the Mayor of London&#x27;s London Plan. These are Elephant and Castle, Canada Water and Old Kent Road.

== Educational establishments ==
London South Bank University (LSBU) has over 23,000 students and 1,700 staff at its principal Elephant and Castle site. The Chancellor is the entrepreneur newscaster Richard Farleigh.

The University of the Arts London has two of its colleges in the borough: the London College of Communication is at Elephant and Castle, and Camberwell College of Arts is on Peckham Road. Its Creative Computing Institute is also on Peckham Road.

The largest university teaching hospital in Europe, King&#x27;s College London, is at the Guy&#x27;s Hospital site, merging the teaching activities of the Guy&#x27;s, St Thomas&#x27; and King&#x27;s College Hospitals here. St Thomas&#x27; was founded in the mid-12th century in the borough and parts of it remain at St Thomas Street; Guy&#x27;s was founded opposite this in 1725. The Salvation Army maintains the William Booth Memorial Training College at Denmark Hill.

Founded in 1945, Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts moved to Peckham in 2018.

== Housing ==
Southwark has a wide variety of housing, including council housing such as the post-Blitz Aylesbury Estate and the Heygate Estate to provide homes to low-income residents. The aforementioned estates have been turned over to local housing associations to demolish and redevelop as mixed-tenure developments. Southwark Council and the Greater London Authority have invested tens of millions of pounds in supporting the respective housing associations complete these projects, which in both cases will lead to a large increase in the number of properties on the sites, with an almost equal reduction in the amount of social housing: the Aylesbury Estate originally housed 2,403 properties at social rent while post-development there will be 1,323 for social rent and 1,733 for private sale; meanwhile the Heygate Estate had 1,214 properties before demolition, most of which were leased at social rent, while the final plans for the development will see 2,530 homes, of which 500 will be social housing.

Southwark&#x27;s local residents&#x27; returns recorded in 2011 that its rented sector comprised 53.4% of its housing, marginally below the highest in England, which was recorded by Camden, at 53.5%. In neighbouring Lambeth this figure was 47.3% and in neighbouring Croydon the figure was 29.7%.

Southwark had the greatest proportion of social housing in England, 43.7% (31.2% owned by the council itself with the other social housing in the hands of housing associations), at the time of the 2011 census. Tenant management organisations benefit many apartment blocks. The council set much housing policy among Housing Association blocks to allocate homes based on need and a rent that residents can afford, based on means testing, via headlease and/or by the Housing List. In many blocks a mixture of social, shared-ownership and private sector housing exists, particularly in those where the right to buy has been exercised and in newer developments.

== Courts and judiciary ==

The old Southwark borough hosted many Courts and Prisons of Royal Prerogative, the Marshalsea and King&#x27;s Bench. As well as the manorial and borough courts, magistrates met until the 20th century at the Surrey Sessions House which had its own jail for the punitive aspect of its work. The Inner London Sessions House (or now Crown Court) on Newington Causeway descends from these. The Southwark Coroner&#x27;s Court in Tennis Street dates back to the charter of 1550. In 1964 Southwark Crown Court was opened at English Grounds near London Bridge. Since 1994 the Crown Court for west London Boroughs, was rehoused from Knightsbridge to Southwark as Blackfriars Crown Court. When the decision was taken to separate the judiciary and legislature, in 2007, by transforming the House of Lords Judicial Committee of Law Lords into the Supreme Court took over the court occupying the Middlesex Guildhall, whose City of Westminster judges transferred to Southwark Crown Court, hence the senior judge holds the honorific title of the Recorder of Westminster. Southwark&#x27;s local magistrates sit at two courts in the borough, Tower Bridge and Camberwell Green Magistrates Courts.

The concentration of major courts, which are unlawful to film save for sentencing with judicial permission, enables their media coverage: Southwark has seven jurisdictions, six of which are London&#x27;s criminal courts and which commonly receive offences committed in public office or in businesses based in Westminster and several other London boroughs.

===Parking and DVLA database ban===
In 2012 it was revealed that the Southwark borough council has been permanently banned from accessing information from the Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency. This information is normally made available to local authorities for purposes such as enforcing parking fines, but access can be withdrawn if they are found to be mis-using the service. The Big Brother Watch organisation, which obtained the information about the ban under a Freedom of Information request, claimed that &quot;the public are right to be worried that their privacy is at risk across a range of government services.&quot;

==Notable residents (past and present)==
In 2003, the London Borough of Southwark started a blue plaque scheme for the commemoration of notable residents notably including living people in the awards. The London Borough of Southwark awards Blue Plaques through popular vote following public nomination. Unlike the English Heritage scheme, the original building is not necessary for nomination.

==Civic affairs==

===Coat of arms===
The two supporters on the coat of arms are, on the left, an Elizabethan player dressed to play Hamlet, indicating the theatrical heritage of the area, and the youth on the right side is the Esquire from Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The coat of arms is an amalgam of elements of the three constituent Metropolitan Boroughs arms. The chequered band represents the three boroughs together. The cross was a common feature of Southwark and Camberwell. The well in the centre of the shield is a &#x27;canting&#x27; reference to Camberwell and the cinquefoils represent the Dulwich area of Camberwell, while the ship on the top left refers to the maritime history of Bermondsey and was part of the Rotherhithe insignia. The rose on the right is from the Southwark arms where it represented St Saviour&#x27;s parish, i.e. the cathedral.

* Langenhagen, Germany

<text>Crystal Palace is an area in South London, named after the Crystal Palace Exhibition building which stood in the area from 1854, until it was destroyed by a fire in 1936. About southeast of Charing Cross, it includes one of the highest points in London, at , offering views over the capital.

The area has no defined boundaries and straddles five London boroughs and three postal districts, although there is a Crystal Palace electoral ward and Crystal Palace Park in the London Borough of Bromley. It forms a part of the greater area known as Upper Norwood, and is contiguous with the areas of Anerley, Dulwich Wood, Gipsy Hill, Penge, South Norwood and Sydenham. The area is represented by four parliamentary constituencies, four London Assembly constituencies and fourteen local councillors.

Until development began in the 19th century, and before the arrival of the Crystal Palace, the area was known as Sydenham Hill. The Norwood Ridge and an historic oak tree were used to mark parish boundaries. After the Crystal Palace burned down in 1936, the site of the building and its grounds became Crystal Palace Park, the location of the National Sports Centre which contains an athletics track, stadium and other sports facilities. Crystal Palace Park has also been used as the setting for a number of concerts and films, such as &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; and contains the Crystal Palace Park Concert Platform, in place since 1997. Two television transmitter masts make the district a landmark location, visible from many parts of Greater London. Local landmarks include the Crystal Palace Triangle, a shopping district made up of three streets forming a triangle; Westow Park, a smaller park that lies off the triangle southwest of Crystal Palace Park; and the Stambourne Woodland Walk.

Crystal Palace was named in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspaper&#x27;s top ten list of &quot;the best places to live in London&quot; of 2016. In April 2022 Crystal Palace was named the best place to live in London by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, being characterised by a bohemian fusion of urban vibes and village-feel.

==History==

The ridge and the historic oak tree known as the Vicar&#x27;s Oak (at the crossroads of the A212 Church Road and A214 Westow Hill) were used to mark parish boundaries. This has led to the Crystal Palace area straddling the boundaries of five London Boroughs; Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. The area also straddles three postcode districts: , , and . The ancient boundary between Surrey and Kent passes through the area, and until 1889 included parts of both counties. From 1889 to 1965 the area was on the south-eastern boundary of the County of London.

For centuries the area was covered by the Great North Wood, an extensive area of natural oak forest that formed a wilderness close to the southern edge of the then expanding city of London. The forest was a popular area for Londoners&#x27; recreation right up to the 19th century, when it began to be built over. It was also a home of Gypsies, with some local street names and pubs recording the link, and the area still retains vestiges of woodland.

A pneumatic railway was briefly trialled in the area in 1864. Once the railways arrived, Crystal Palace was eventually served by two railway stations, the high level and low level stations, built to handle the large volume of passengers visiting the exhibition building. After the Palace was destroyed by fire, and with railway travel declining, passenger numbers fell and the high level station was closed in 1954 and demolished seven years later. Rail services gradually declined, and for a period in the 1960s and 1970s, there were plans to construct an urban motorway through the area as part of the London Ringways plan. With rising passenger numbers, additional London Overground services began stopping at the station and a major station redevelopment occurred.

===The Crystal Palace===

The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton, was a remarkable construction of prefabricated parts. It was a cast-iron and glass building originally erected in Hyde Park to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. Following the success of the exhibition, the Palace was moved and reconstructed in 1854 in a modified and enlarged form in the grounds of the Penge Place estate at Sydenham Hill. The buildings housed the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature and Crystal Palace School of Engineering. It attracted visitors for over seven decades.

Sydenham Hill is one of the highest locations in London; 109 metres (357 ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); and the size of the Palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.

===Crystal Palace Triangle===

The area is formed by Westow Street, Westow Hill and Church Road, and has a number of restaurants and several independent shops, as well as an indoor secondhand market and a farmer&#x27;s market on Haynes Lane. The triangle also contains a range of vintage furniture and clothing stores, as well as galleries, arts and crafts shops and other businesses. There was an ongoing campaign to turn a former bingo hall (at 25 Church Road) back into a cinema, after it had been purchased by the Kingsway International Christian Centre. The cinema had opened as &quot;The Rialto&quot; in 1928, later being renamed &quot;The Picture Palace&quot;, only to close in 1968 and become a bingo hall. In 2018 after considerable restoration and renovation, Everyman Cinemas re-opened 25 Church Road as their 25th nationwide cinema location.
===Transmitters===
Television transmission has been taking place from Crystal Palace since at least the 1930s and two TV transmitter towers — Crystal Palace Transmitter – tall — and Croydon Transmitter – tall — stand on the hill at Upper Norwood, making the district a landmark location visible from many parts of London. The towers may appear similar in height and design, but the Crystal Palace mast, constructed in 1956, is on a slightly higher elevation. The current Croydon tower was built in 1962.
===Crystal Palace Park===
Crystal Palace Park is a large Victorian pleasure ground occupying much of the land within Crystal Palace and is one of the major London public parks. The park was maintained by the LCC and later the GLC, but with the abolition of the GLC in 1986, control of the entire park was given to the London Borough of Bromley. From 15 September 2023 responsibility for the park&#x27;s management has been handed to the Crystal Palace Park Trust. Crystal Palace railway station is located by the park, as is the National Sports Centre. The park was formerly used for sports such as cricket, football and motor racing, and has been a venue for concerts often performed at the site of the Crystal Palace Park Concert Platform. In recent years the park has played host to organised music events such as Wireless Festival and South Facing Festival. It is also home to the famous Crystal Palace Dinosaur sculptures.

The park is situated halfway along Norwood Ridge at one of its highest points. This ridge offers views northwards to central London, east to the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and Greenwich, and southward to Croydon and the North Downs. It is also one of the starting points for the Green Chain Walk, linking to places such as Chislehurst, Erith, the Thames Barrier and Thamesmead. Section 3 of the Capital Ring walk round London goes through the park.
===Westow Park===
A smaller park occupying is to the southwest of the triangle on Church Road. Westow Park hosts the annual Crystal Palace Overground festival, a free community festival held over four days in the summer.
===Stambourne Woods===
To the south of the triangle is a small area of woodland occupying , containing the Stambourne Woodland Walk. It was opened in 1984 and covers an area between developments on Stambourne Way and Fox Hill. The land originally formed the gardens of Victorian villas built on the hill overlooking Croydon, but fell into disrepair. In 1962, the Croydon Council approved terms for buying the land from the Church Commissioners and other local freeholders, allowing the construction of a link. Paths and benches were installed but much of the vegetation was left undisturbed, creating a woodland pathway.

===Saint Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church===
At 69 Westow Street is an ornate Greek Orthodox Church which serves the Greek Cypriot and Orthodox community in the surrounding area. Built in 1878, and formerly an Anglican church (St. Andrew&#x27;s), the walls are now dressed in ornate Byzantine-style art.
==Geography==

Crystal Palace is about southeast of Charing Cross on Norwood Ridge and includes one of the highest points of London at 112 metres above the mean sea level (OS map reference TQ337707). The Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, in the centre of the park, is above the mean sea level. The soil in the area has been classified as typically &quot;Slowly permeable, seasonally wet, slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils&quot;, with impeded drainage, moderate fertility and a loamy profile. The nearest Met Office climate station is based in Greenwich Park.

==Local government==
Crystal Palace is on the boundary of four London boroughs – Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth and Southwark. A fifth borough – Lewisham – is nearby. As a result, the area is served by a diverse range of local government bodies and Members of Parliament (MPs).

===Local authorities===

Several local authority councillors in the area were elected on 5 May 2022. All seats bar 1 are held by Labour party candidates. The elected officials by ward for Crystal Palace local authorities in October 2023 were:

===London Assembly===
The area is represented by four constituencies in the London Assembly. Their elected assembly members in 2024 were:

===Westminster Parliament===
The area is represented by four constituencies in the Westminster Parliament. In July 2024, their elected MPs were:

==Media==

===Films===

&quot;The Italian Job&quot; has a scene filmed at the athletics track in the Crystal Palace sports centre, in which Michael Caine says, &quot;You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!&quot; &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; was also filmed in the park and &quot;Our Mother&#x27;s House&quot; has a scene featuring Dirk Bogarde with several children on the park&#x27;s boating lake.

The park features prominently as the setting of an outdoor rave in the music video for The Chemical Brothers&#x27; number 1 single &quot;Setting Sun&quot;.

===Literature===
Arthur Conan Doyle was active in the area between 1891 and 1894. Although he lived in nearby South Norwood, he visited the Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood area regularly in connection with the Upper Norwood Literary and Scientific Society. The Foresters Hall on Westow Street was then known as the Welcome Hall (or just Welcome), and it was in that hall in May 1892 that Arthur Conan Doyle was elected President of the society. He was re-elected to the post in 1893 and resigned in 1894. Each occasion was held in the same hall.

The writer Deborah Crombie sets her 2013 mystery, &quot;The Sound of Broken Glass&quot;, in the Crystal Palace area of London.

==Sports==

===Crystal Palace Football Club===
The club were formed in 1905 and initially played their home games at the sports stadium situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace. However, in 1915 they were forced to leave due to the First World War and played at nearby Herne Hill Velodrome and the Nest, before moving to their current home at Selhurst Park in 1924.

===FA Cup Final===
The FA Cup Final was hosted at the Palace sports stadium between 1895 and 1914.

The historical grounds also hosted the first England Rugby Union match against New Zealand in 1905, which New Zealand won by 15–0. The London County Cricket Club also played their matches here, having been formed by The Crystal Palace Company with the help of W. G. Grace.

===National Sports Centre===
In 1964, a 15,500 seater athletics stadium and sports centre was built on the former site of the football stadium in Crystal Palace Park. The athletics stadium was known as the National Sports Centre and between 1999 and 2012 hosted the London Athletics Grand Prix among other international athletics meetings. The Crystal Palace triathletes club is also based here. Since the London 2012 Olympics, the status of the stadium and aquatics centre as the main facilities for their sports in London has been superseded by the London Aquatics Centre and Olympic Stadium. This led to Crystal Palace F.C. submitting plans to rebuild the stadium as a 40,000 capacity football stadium.

===Motor Racing===

A motor racing circuit was opened around the Park in 1927 and the remains of the track now make up some of the access roads around the park. The track was extended to in 1936, before being taken over by the Ministry of Defence at the start of World War II. Race meetings resumed in 1953, and the circuit hosted a range of international racing events, continuing until the last races in 1974. For three years, from 1997, parts of the circuit were used for a once-a-year sprint time trial similar to a hillclimb before stopping due to development work. The event resumed in 2010 and continued until 2019.

==Education==

Crystal Palace contains three primary schools, Paxton Primary School, Rockmount Primary School and All Saints C of E Primary School, and one secondary school, Harris City Academy. Crystal Palace Park also contains a branch of Capel Manor College, offering courses in Animal Care, Arboriculture and Countryside, Horticulture and Landscaping and Garden Design along with other short courses.

In 2013, due to a shortage of primary school places in both Crystal Palace and London, proposals to open a new primary school by September 2015 were put forward, with plans submitted to the Department for Education in January 2014. The proposals were approved as part of wave 6 of the Free Schools Programme and the school is scheduled to open in September 2015. As of October 2014, the school is considering three possible building configurations – with the Greater London Authority running a public consultation on each option – all of which would involve demolishing one of the seated stands around the athletics track at the National Sports Centre.
==Transport==

===Roads===
The area is served by the A212, A214, A234 and A2199 roads. The roads that make up the triangle (Westow Hill, Westow Street and Church Road) form part of a one-way system and are in a 24-hour controlled parking and loading zone. There is a coach park inside Crystal Palace Park.

The area would have been affected by the cancelled London Ringways motorway plans, as one of the radial routes connecting the South Cross Route to Ringway 2 (the South Cross Route to Parkway D Radial) would have run through a part of Crystal Palace Park, following the railway line.

====Cycle routes====
London Cycle Network routes 23 and 27 travel through Crystal Palace. Route 27 runs from Anerley Hill through part of Crystal Palace Park towards Bromley and route 23 runs through the Crystal Palace triangle to connect to Borough and Croydon.

Transport for London have proposed to build Quietway route 7 that runs from Crystal Palace to Elephant and Castle. The route was subject to consultation processes in the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark in 2016, with construction to begin in 2017.

===Rail===

Crystal Palace is accessible by rail from Crystal Palace railway station, where Southern trains run between Victoria on the Crystal Palace Line and London Bridge on the Brighton Main Line, and where London Overground trains run to Highbury &amp; Islington on the East London Line. In addition, Southern services run to Beckenham Junction, Sutton and Epsom Downs. Crystal Palace railway station is one of the few stations to border two zones, Zones 3 and 4. The South Gate of the Park is accessible by rail via Penge West, which is served by Southern trains from London Bridge and London Overground services.

Crystal Palace used to have a second railway station, the Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station. The station was built to serve passengers visiting the Crystal Palace, but after the fire in 1936, traffic on the branch line declined. In World War II, the line serving the station was temporarily closed due to bomb damage. Repairs were made and the line was reopened, but the requirement for reconstruction and the decline in traffic led to a decision to close the station and branch line in 1954, followed by the demolition of the station in 1961. Despite the demolition, a Grade II listed subway remains under Crystal Palace Parade. The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway was also built in Crystal Palace c.1864.
The low level station remain open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell after the fire of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes instead of the Victoria–London Bridge route. Rail travel was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe was imposed. In the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the third rail was removed.

More recently rail travel at the station has seen a resurgence and new services have started running. Passenger numbers increased each year between 2004 and 2013. Since May 2010, the station has served the East London Line branch of the London Overground, connecting with the Docklands and Shoreditch. In 2011 services were extended to Highbury and Islington. The station underwent redevelopment in 2012, which brought the original Victorian booking hall back into use, created a new cafe in the station building and provided wheelchair access through the installation of three lifts; this work was completed by the end of March 2013.

===Tram===
Tram services from Surrey used to operate up Anerley Hill to the Crystal Palace Parade until the 1930s. More recently there have been proposals to connect Tramlink to Crystal Palace, with mayoral candidates citing the desirability of the initiative.
===Bus===
The area is served by multiple bus routes, many of which terminate at Crystal Palace Bus Station situated on the Parade. These services include routes N2, 3/N3, N63, 122, N137, 157, 202, 227, 249, 322, 358, 363, 410, 417, 432 and 450.

===Air===
The nearest major international airports are Heathrow and Gatwick. London City Airport and Biggin Hill Airport are also nearby.

<text>Sir Marc Isambard Brunel (, ; 25 April 1769 – 12 December 1849) was a French-British engineer who is most famous for the work he did in Britain. He constructed the Thames Tunnel and was the father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Born in France, Brunel fled to the United States during the French Revolution. In 1796, he was appointed Chief Engineer of New York City. He moved to London in 1799, where he married Sophia Kingdom. In addition to the construction of the Thames Tunnel, his work as a mechanical engineer included the design of machinery to automate the production of pulley blocks for the Royal Navy.

Brunel preferred the given name Isambard, but is generally known to history as Marc to avoid confusion with his more famous son.

== Early life in France ==
Brunel was the second son of Jean Charles Brunel and Marie-Victoire Lefebvre. Jean Charles was a prosperous farmer in Hacqueville, Normandy, and Marc was born on the family farm. It was customary in prosperous families for the first son to inherit the family land and the second son to enter the priesthood. His father therefore started Marc on a classical education, but he showed no liking for Greek or Latin and instead showed himself proficient in drawing and mathematics. He was also very musical from an early age.

At the age of eleven he was sent to a seminary in Rouen. The superior of the seminary allowed him to learn carpentry, and he soon achieved the standards of a cabinetmaker. He also sketched ships in the local harbour. As he showed no desire to become a priest, his father sent him to stay with relatives in Rouen, where a family friend tutored him on naval matters. In 1786, as a result of this tuition, Marc became a naval cadet on a French frigate and during his service visited the West Indies several times. He made an octant for himself from brass and ivory, and used it during his service.

In 1789, during Brunel&#x27;s service abroad, the French Revolution began. In January 1792 Brunel&#x27;s frigate paid off its crew, and Brunel returned to live with his relatives in Rouen. He was a Royalist sympathiser, as were most of the inhabitants of Normandy. In January 1793, whilst visiting Paris during the trial of Louis XVI, Brunel unwisely publicly predicted the demise of Robespierre, one of the leaders of the Revolution. He was lucky to get out of Paris with his life, and returned to Rouen. However, it was evident that he would have to leave France. During his stay in Rouen, Brunel had met Sophia Kingdom, a young English woman who was an orphan and was working as a governess. He was forced to leave her behind when he fled to Le Havre and boarded the American ship &quot;Liberty&quot;, bound for New York.

== United States ==
Brunel arrived in New York on 6 September 1793, and he subsequently travelled to Philadelphia and Albany. He got involved in a scheme to link the Hudson River by canal with Lake Champlain, and also submitted a design for the new Capitol building to be built in Washington. The judges were very impressed with the design, but it was not selected.

In 1796, after taking American citizenship, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the city of New York. He designed various houses, docks, commercial buildings, an arsenal, and a cannon factory. No official records exist of the projects that he carried out in New York, as it seems likely that the documents were destroyed in the New York draft riots of 1863.

In 1798, during a dinner conversation, Brunel learnt of the difficulties that the Royal Navy had in obtaining the 100,000 pulley blocks that it needed each year. Each of these was made by hand. Brunel quickly produced an outline design of a set of machines that would automate their production. He decided to sail to England and put his invention before the Admiralty. He sailed for England on 7 February 1799 with a letter of introduction to the Navy Minister, and on 7 March his ship, &quot;Halifax&quot;, landed at Falmouth.

== Britain ==
Whilst Brunel had been in the United States, Sophia Kingdom had remained in Rouen and during the Reign of Terror, she was arrested as an English spy and daily expected to be executed. She was only saved by the fall of Robespierre in June 1794. In April 1795 Kingdom was able to leave France and travel to London.

When Brunel arrived from the United States, he immediately travelled to London and made contact with Kingdom. They were married on 1 November 1799 at St Andrew, Holborn. In 1801 she gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Sophia; in 1804 their second daughter Emma; and in 1806 their son Isambard Kingdom, who became a great engineer. Isambard Kingdom grew up in Lindsey House in Chelsea, London.

During the summer of 1799 Brunel was introduced to Henry Maudslay, a talented engineer who had worked for Joseph Bramah, and had recently started his own business. Maudslay made working models of the machines for making pulley blocks, and Brunel approached Samuel Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works. In April 1802 Bentham recommended the installation of Brunel&#x27;s block-making machinery at Portsmouth Block Mills. Brunel&#x27;s machine could be operated by unskilled workers, at ten times the previous rate of production. Altogether 45 machines were installed at Portsmouth, and by 1808 the plant was producing 130,000 blocks per year. Unfortunately for Brunel, the Admiralty vacillated over payment, despite the fact that Brunel had spent more than £2,000 of his own money on the project. In August 1808 they agreed to pay £1,000 on account, and two years later they consented to a payment of just over £17,000.

Brunel was a talented mechanical engineer, and did much to develop sawmill machinery, undertaking contracts for the British Government at Chatham and Woolwich dockyards, building on his experience at the Portsmouth Block Mills. He built a sawmill at Battersea, London (burnt down in 1814 and rebuilt by 1816), which was designed to produce veneers, and he also designed sawmills for entrepreneurs. He also developed machinery for mass-producing soldiers&#x27; boots, but before this could reach full production, demand ceased due to the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Brunel was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1814. In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Brunel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1834. In 1845 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

== Debtors&#x27; prison ==
Brunel several times became involved in unprofitable projects. As a consequence, by the beginning of 1821 he was deep in debt, and in May of that year he was tried and committed to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, a debtors&#x27; prison in Southwark. Prisoners in a debtors&#x27; prison were allowed to have their family with them, and Sophia accompanied him. Brunel spent 88 days incarcerated. As time passed with no prospect of gaining release, Brunel began to correspond with Alexander I of Russia about the possibility of moving with his family to St Petersburg to work for the Tsar. As soon as it was learnt that Britain was likely to lose such an eminent engineer as Brunel, influential figures, such as the Duke of Wellington, began to press for government intervention. The government granted £5,000 to clear Brunel&#x27;s debts on condition that he abandon any plans to go to Russia. As a result, Brunel was released from prison in August.

== Thames Tunnel ==

In 1805 the Thames Archway Company was formed with the intention of driving a tunnel beneath the Thames between Rotherhithe and Limehouse. Richard Trevithick was engaged by the company to construct the tunnel. He used Cornish miners to work on the tunnel. In 1807 the tunnel encountered quicksand and conditions became difficult and dangerous. Eventually the tunnel was abandoned after more than 1,000 feet had been completed, and expert opinion, led by William Jessop, was that such a tunnel was impracticable.

Brunel had already drawn up plans for a tunnel under the River Neva in Russia, but this scheme never came to fruition. In 1818 Brunel had patented a tunnelling shield. This was a reinforced shield of cast iron in which miners would work in separate compartments, digging at the tunnel-face. Periodically the shield would be driven forward by large jacks, and the tunnel surface behind it would be lined with brick. It is claimed that Brunel found the inspiration for his tunnelling shield from the shipworm, &quot;Teredo navalis&quot;, which has its head protected by a hard shell whilst it bores through ships&#x27; timbers.

Brunel&#x27;s invention provided the basis for subsequent tunnelling shields used to build the London Underground system and many other tunnels. Brunel was so convinced that he could use such a tunnelling shield to dig a tunnel under the Thames, that he wrote to every person of influence who might be interested. At last in February 1824 a meeting was held and 2,128 shares at £50 each were subscribed for. In June 1824 the Thames Tunnel Company was incorporated by royal assent. The tunnel was intended for horse-drawn traffic.
Work began in February 1825, by sinking a vertical shaft on the Rotherhithe bank. This was done by constructing a 50-foot-diameter metal ring, upon which a circular brick tower was built. As the tower rose in height, its weight forced the ring into the ground. At the same time, workmen excavated the earth in the centre of the ring. This vertical shaft was completed in November 1825, and the tunnelling shield, which had been manufactured at Lambeth by Henry Maudslay&#x27;s company, was then assembled at the bottom. Maudslay also supplied the steam powered pumps for the project.

The shield was rectangular in cross section, and consisted of twelve frames, side by side, each of which could be moved forward independently of the others. Each frame contained three compartments, one above the other, each big enough for one man to excavate the tunnel face. The whole frame accommodated 36 miners. When enough material had been removed from the tunnel face, the frame was moved forward by large jacks. As the shield moved forward, bricklayers followed, lining the walls. The tunnel required over 7.5 million bricks.

=== Problems ===
Brunel was assisted in his work by his son, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, now 18 years old. Brunel had planned the tunnel to pass no more than fourteen feet below the riverbed at its lowest point. This caused problems later. Another problem that hindered Brunel was that William Smith, the chairman of the company, thought that the tunnelling shield was an unnecessary luxury, and that the tunnel could be made more cheaply by traditional methods. He wanted Brunel replaced as Chief Engineer and constantly tried to undermine his position. The shield quickly proved its worth. During the tunnelling both Brunel and his assistant engineer suffered ill health and for a while Isambard had to bear the whole burden of the work.

There were several instances of flooding at the tunnel face due to its nearness to the bed of the river. In May 1827 it was necessary to plug an enormous hole that appeared on the riverbed. The resources of the Thames Tunnel Company were consumed, and despite efforts to raise more money, the tunnel was sealed up in August 1828. Brunel resigned from his position, frustrated by the continued opposition from the chairman. He undertook various civil engineering projects, including helping his son, Isambard, with his design of the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

In March 1832 William Smith was deposed as chairman of the Thames Tunnel Company. He had been a thorn in Brunel&#x27;s side throughout the project. In 1834 the government agreed a loan of £246,000 to the Thames Tunnel Company. The old 80-ton tunnelling shield was removed and replaced by a new improved 140-ton shield consisting of 9,000 parts that had to be fitted together underground. Tunnelling was resumed but there were still instances of flooding in which the pumps were overwhelmed. Miners were affected by the constant influx of polluted water, and many fell ill. As the tunnel approached the Wapping shore, work began on sinking a vertical shaft similar to the Rotherhithe one. This began in 1840 and took thirteen months to complete.

On 24 March 1841 Brunel was knighted by the young Queen Victoria. This was at the suggestion of Prince Albert who had shown keen interest in the progress of the tunnel. The tunnel opened on the Wapping side of the river on 1 August 1842. On 7 November 1842 Brunel suffered a stroke that paralysed his right side for a time. The Thames Tunnel officially opened on 25 March 1843. Brunel, despite ill health, took part in the opening ceremony. Within 15 weeks of opening, one million people visited the tunnel. On 26 July 1843 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited. Although intended for horse-drawn traffic, the tunnel remained pedestrian only.

=== Later developments ===
In 1865 the East London Railway Company purchased the Thames Tunnel for £200,000 and four years later the first trains passed through it. The tunnel became part of the London Underground system, and remains in use today, as part of the East London Line of London Overground.

The engine house in Rotherhithe was taken over by a charitable trust in 1975 and transformed into the Brunel Museum in 2006.

== Subsequent life ==

After the completion of the Thames Tunnel, his greatest achievement, Brunel was in poor health. He never again accepted major commissions, although he did help his son, Isambard, on various projects. He was proud of his son&#x27;s achievements, and was present at the launch of the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; in Bristol on 19 July 1843. In 1845 Brunel suffered another, more severe stroke and was almost totally paralysed on his right side. On 12 December 1849, Brunel died at the age of 80, and his remains were interred in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. His wife, Sophia, was subsequently interred in the same plot, followed by their son, Isambard, just 10 years later.

<text>Sogdia or Sogdiana was an ancient Iranian civilization between the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, and in present-day Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Sogdiana was also a province of the Achaemenid Empire, and listed on the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great. Sogdiana was first conquered by Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, and then was annexed by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great in 328 BC. It would continue to change hands under the Seleucid Empire, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, the Kushan Empire, the Sasanian Empire, the Hephthalite Empire, the Western Turkic Khaganate, and the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana.

The Sogdian city-states, although never politically united, were centered on the city of Samarkand. Sogdian, an Eastern Iranian language, is no longer spoken. However, a descendant of one of its dialects, Yaghnobi, is still spoken by the Yaghnobis of Tajikistan. It was widely spoken in Central Asia as a lingua franca and served as one of the First Turkic Khaganate&#x27;s court languages for writing documents.

Sogdians also lived in Imperial China and rose to prominence in the military and government of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Sogdian merchants and diplomats travelled as far west as the Byzantine Empire. They played an essential part as middlemen in the Silk Road trade route. While initially practicing the faiths of Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Buddhism and, to a lesser extent, the Church of the East from West Asia, the gradual conversion to Islam among the Sogdians and their descendants began with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana in the 8th century. The Sogdian conversion to Islam was virtually complete by the end of the Samanid Empire in 999, coinciding with the decline of the Sogdian language, as it was largely supplanted by New Persian.

== Geography ==
Sogdiana lay north of Bactria, east of Khwarezm, and southeast of Kangju between the Oxus (Amu Darya) and the Jaxartes (Syr Darya), including the fertile valley of the Zeravshan (called the Polytimetus by the ancient Greeks). Sogdian territory corresponds to the modern regions of Samarkand and Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan, as well as the Sughd region of modern Tajikistan. In the High Middle Ages, Sogdian cities included sites stretching towards Issyk Kul, such as that at the archeological site of Suyab.

== Name ==
Oswald Szemerényi devotes a thorough discussion to the etymologies of ancient ethnic words for the Scythians in his work &quot;Four Old Iranian Ethnic Names: Scythian – Skudra – Sogdian – Saka&quot;. In it, the names provided by the Greek historian Herodotus and the names of his title, except Saka, as well as many other words for &quot;Scythian&quot;, such as Assyrian &quot;Aškuz&quot; and Greek &quot;Skuthēs&quot;, descend from *skeud-, an ancient Indo-European root meaning &quot;propel, shoot&quot; (cf. English shoot). *skud- is the zero-grade; that is, a variant in which the -e- is not present. The restored Scythian name is *Skuδa (archer), which among the Pontic or Royal Scythians became *Skula, in which the δ has been regularly replaced by an l. According to Szemerényi, Sogdiana (; ; ; ; ; ) was named from the Skuδa form. Starting from the names of the province given in Old Persian inscriptions, Sugda and Suguda, and the knowledge derived from Middle Sogdian that Old Persian -gd- applied to Sogdian was pronounced as voiced fricatives, -γδ-, Szemerényi arrives at *Suγδa as an Old Sogdian endonym. Applying sound changes apparent in other Sogdian words and inherent in Indo-European, he traces the development of *Suγδa from Skuδa, &quot;archer&quot;, as follows: Skuδa &gt; *Sukuda by anaptyxis &gt; *Sukuδa &gt; *Sukδa (syncope) &gt; *Suγδa (assimilation).

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture: original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning as far back as the 4th millennium BC, and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC.

===Young Avestan period (c. 900–500 BC)===

In the Avesta, namely in the Mihr Yasht and the Vendidad, the toponym of Gava () is mentioned as the land of the Sogdians. Gava is, therefore, interpreted as referring to Sogdia during the time of the Avesta. Although there is no universal consensus on the chronology of the Avesta, most scholars today argue for an early chronology, which would place the composition of Young Avestan texts like the Mihr Yasht and the Vendiad in the first half of the first millennium BCE.
The first mention of Gava is found in the Mihr Yasht, ie., the hymn dedicated to the Zoroastrian deity Mithra. In verse 10.14 it is described how Mithra reaches Mount Hara and looks at the entirety of the Airyoshayan (, &#x27;lands of the Arya&#x27;),

The second mention is found in the first chapter of the Vendidad, which consists of a list of the sixteen good regions created by Ahura Mazda for the Iranians. Gava is the second region mentioned on the list, directly behind Airyanem Vaejah, the homeland of Zarathustra and the Iranians, according to Zoroastrian tradition:

While it is widely accepted that Gava referred to the region inhabited by the Sogdians during the Avestan period, its meaning is not clear. For example, Vogelsang connects it with Gabae, a Sogdian stronghold in western Sogdia and speculates that during the time of the Avesta, the center of Sogdia may have been closer to Bukhara instead of Samarkand.

=== Achaemenid period (546–327 BC)===

Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while campaigning in Central Asia in 546–539 BC, a fact mentioned by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot;. Darius I introduced the Aramaic writing system and coin currency to Central Asia, in addition to incorporating Sogdians into his standing army as regular soldiers and cavalrymen. Sogdia was also listed on the Behistun Inscription of Darius. A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his second, ultimately-failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian originating from Sogdiana.

During this period of Persian rule, the western half of Asia Minor was part of the Greek civilization. As the Achaemenids conquered it, they met persistent resistance and revolt. One of their solutions was to ethnically cleanse rebelling regions, relocating those who survived to the far side of the empire. Thus Sogdiana came to have a significant Greek population.
Given the absence of any named satraps (i.e. Achaemenid provincial governors) for Sogdiana in historical records, modern scholarship has concluded that Sogdiana was governed from the satrapy of nearby Bactria. The satraps were often relatives of the ruling Persian kings, especially sons who were not designated as the heir apparent. Sogdiana likely remained under Persian control until roughly 400 BC, during the reign of Artaxerxes II. Rebellious states of the Persian Empire took advantage of the weak Artaxerxes II, and some, such as Egypt, were able to regain their independence. Persia&#x27;s massive loss of Central Asian territory is widely attributed to the ruler&#x27;s lack of control. However, unlike Egypt, which was quickly recaptured by the Persian Empire, Sogdiana remained independent until it was conquered by Alexander the Great. When the latter invaded the Persian Empire, Pharasmanes, an already independent king of Khwarezm, allied with the Macedonians and sent troops to Alexander in 329 BC for his war against the Scythians of the Black Sea region (even though this anticipated campaign never materialized).

During the Achaemenid period (550–330 BC), the Sogdians lived as a nomadic people much like the neighboring Yuezhi, who spoke Bactrian, an Indo-Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, and were already engaging in overland trade. Some of them had also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture. Similar to how the Yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of China, the Sogdians are recorded in Persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and carnelian to Darius I, the Persian king of kings. Although the Sogdians were at times independent and living outside the boundaries of large empires, they never formed a great empire of their own like the Yuezhi, who established the Kushan Empire (30–375 AD) of Central and South Asia.

=== Hellenistic period (327–145 BC)===
A now-independent and warlike Sogdiana formed a border region insulating the Achaemenid Persians from the nomadic Scythians to the north and east. It was led at first by Bessus, the Achaemenid satrap of Bactria. After assassinating Darius III in his flight from the Macedonian Greek army, he became claimant to the Achaemenid throne. The Sogdian Rock or Rock of Ariamazes, a fortress in Sogdiana, was captured in 327 BC by the forces of Alexander the Great, the &quot;basileus&quot; of Macedonian Greece, and conqueror of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Oxyartes, a Sogdian nobleman of Bactria, had hoped to keep his daughter Roxana safe at the fortress of the Sogdian Rock, yet after its fall Roxana was soon wed to Alexander as one of his several wives. Roxana, a Sogdian whose name &quot;Roshanak&quot; means &quot;little star&quot;, was the mother of Alexander IV of Macedon, who inherited his late father&#x27;s throne in 323 BC (although the empire was soon divided in the Wars of the Diadochi).

After an extended campaign putting down Sogdian resistance and founding military outposts manned by his Macedonian veterans, Alexander united Sogdiana with Bactria into one satrapy. The Sogdian nobleman and warlord Spitamenes (370–328 BC), allied with Scythian tribes, led an uprising against Alexander&#x27;s forces. This revolt was put down by Alexander and his generals Amyntas, Craterus, and Coenus, with the aid of native Bactrian and Sogdian troops. With the Scythian and Sogdian rebels defeated, Spitamenes was allegedly betrayed by his own wife and beheaded. Pursuant with his own marriage to Roxana, Alexander encouraged his men to marry Sogdian women in order to discourage further revolt. This included Apama, daughter of the rebel Spitamenes, who wed Seleucus I Nicator and bore him a son and future heir to the Seleucid throne. According to the Roman historian Appian, Seleucus I named three new Hellenistic cities in Asia after her (see &quot;Apamea&quot;).

The military power of the Sogdians never recovered. Subsequently, Sogdiana formed part of the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a breakaway state from the Seleucid Empire founded in 248 BC by Diodotus I, for roughly a century. Euthydemus I, a former satrap of Sogdiana, seems to have held the Sogdian territory as a rival claimant to the Greco-Bactrian throne; his coins were later copied locally and bore Aramaic inscriptions. The Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides I may have recovered sovereignty of Sogdia temporarily.

=== Saka and Kushan periods (146 BC–260 AD) ===

Finally Sogdia was occupied by nomads when the Sakas overran the Greco-Bactrian kingdom around 145 BC, soon followed by the Yuezhi, the nomadic predecessors of the Kushans. From then until about 40 BC the Yuezhi tepidly minted coins imitating and still bearing the images of the Greco-Bactrian kings Eucratides I and Heliocles I.

The Yuezhis were visited in Transoxiana by a Chinese mission, led by Zhang Qian in 126 BC, which sought an offensive alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. Zhang Qian, who spent a year in Transoxiana and Bactria, wrote a detailed account in the &quot;Shiji&quot;, which gives considerable insight into the situation in Central Asia at the time. The request for an alliance was denied by the son of the slain Yuezhi king, who preferred to maintain peace in Transoxiana rather than seek revenge.
Zhang Qian also reported:

From the 1st century AD, the Yuezhi morphed into the powerful Kushan Empire, covering an area from Sogdia to eastern India. The Kushan Empire became the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce. They began minting unique coins bearing the faces of their own rulers. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they allied with the Han dynasty general Ban Chao against the Sogdians in 84, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar.

=== Sasanian satrapy (260–479 AD) ===
Historical knowledge about Sogdia is somewhat hazy during the period of the Parthian Empire (247 BC – 224 AD) in Persia. The subsequent Sasanian Empire of Persia conquered and incorporated Sogdia as a satrapy in 260, an inscription dating to the reign of Shapur I claiming &quot;Sogdia, to the mountains of Tashkent&quot; as his territory, and noting that its limits formed the northeastern Sasanian borderlands with the Kushan Empire. However, by the 5th century the region was captured by the rival Hephthalite Empire.

=== Hephthalite conquest of Sogdiana (479–557 AD) ===

The Hephthalites conquered the territory of Sogdiana, and incorporated it into their Empire, around 479 AD, as this is the date of the last known independent embassy of the Sogdians to China.

The Hephthalites may have built major fortified Hippodamian cities (rectangular walls with an orthogonal network of streets) in Sogdiana, such as Bukhara and Panjikent, as they had also in Herat, continuing the city-building efforts of the Kidarites. The Hephthalites probably ruled over a confederation of local rulers or governors, linked through alliance agreements. One of these vassals may have been Asbar, ruler of Vardanzi, who also minted his own coinage during the period.
The wealth of the Sasanian ransoms and tributes to the Hephthalites may have been reinvested in Sogdia, possibly explaining the prosperity of the region from that time. Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous under its nomadic elites. The Hephthalites took on the role of major intermediary on the Silk Road, after their great predecessor the Kushans, and contracted local Sogdians to carry on the trade of silk and other luxury goods between the Chinese Empire and the Sasanian Empire.

Because of the Hephthalite occupation of Sogdia, the original coinage of Sogdia came to be flooded by the influx of Sasanian coins received as a tribute to the Hephthalites. This coinage then spread along the Silk Road. The symbol of the Hephthalites appears on the residual coinage of Samarkand, probably as a consequence of the Hephthalite control of Sogdia, and becomes prominent in Sogdian coinage from 500 to 700 AD, including in the coinage of their indigenous successors the Ikhshids (642–755 AD), ending with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana.

=== Turkic Khaganates (557–742 AD) ===

The Turks of the First Turkic Khaganate and the Sasanians under Khosrow I allied against the Hephthalites and defeated them after an eight-day battle near Qarshi, the Battle of Bukhara, perhaps in 557. The Turks retained the area north of the Oxus, including all of Sogdia, while the Sasanians obtained the areas south of it. The Turks fragmented in 581, and the Western Turkic Khaganate took over in Sogdia.

Archaeological remains suggest that the Turks probably became the main trading partners of the Sogdians, as appears from the tomb of the Sogdian trader An Jia. The Turks also appear in great numbers in the Afrasiab murals of Samarkand, where they are probably shown attending the reception by the local Sogdian ruler Varkhuman in the 7th century AD. These paintings suggest that Sogdia was a very cosmopolitan environment at that time, as delegates of various nations, including Chinese and Korean delegates, are also shown. From around 650, China led the conquest of the Western Turks, and the Sogdian rulers such as Varkhuman as well as the Western Turks all became nominal vassals of China, as part of the Anxi Protectorate of the Tang dynasty, until the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana.

===Arab Muslim conquest (8th century AD)===


====Umayyads (−750)====
Qutayba ibn Muslim (669–716), Governor of Greater Khorasan under the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), initiated the Muslim conquest of Sogdia during the early 8th century, with the local ruler of Balkh offering him aid as an Umayyad ally. However, when his successor al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah governed Khorasan (717–719), many native Sogdians, who had converted to Islam, began to revolt when they were no longer exempt from paying the tax on non-Muslims, the &quot;jizya,&quot; because of a new law stating that proof of circumcision and literacy in the Quran was necessary for new converts. With the aid of the Turkic Turgesh, the Sogdians were able to expel the Umayyad Arab garrison from Samarkand, and Umayyad attempts to restore power there were rebuffed until the arrival of Sa&#x27;id ibn Amr al-Harashi (fl. 720–735). The Sogdian ruler (i.e. &quot;ikhshid&quot;) of Samarkand, Gurak, who had previously overthrown the pro-Umayyad Sogdian ruler Tarkhun in 710, decided that resistance against al-Harashi&#x27;s large Arab force was pointless, and thereafter persuaded his followers to declare allegiance to the Umayyad governor. Divashtich (r. 706–722), the Sogdian ruler of Panjakent, led his forces to the Zarafshan Range (near modern Zarafshan, Tajikistan), whereas the Sogdians following Karzanj, the ruler of Pai (modern Kattakurgan, Uzbekistan), fled to the Principality of Farghana, where their ruler at-Tar (or Alutar) promised them safety and refuge from the Umayyads. However, at-Tar secretly informed al-Harashi of the Sogdians hiding in Khujand, who were then slaughtered by al-Harashi&#x27;s forces after their arrival.

From 722, following the Muslim invasion, new groups of Sogdians, many of them Nestorian Christians, emigrated to the east, where the Turks had been more welcoming and more tolerant of their religion since the time of Sassanian religious persecutions. They particularly created colonies in the area of Semirechye, where they continued to flourish into the 10th century with the rise of the Karluks and the Kara-Khanid Khanate. These Sogdians are known for producing beautiful silver plates with Eastern Christian iconography, such as the &quot;Anikova dish&quot;.

====Abbasid Caliphate (750–819)====

The Umayyads fell in 750 to the Abbasid Caliphate, which quickly asserted itself in Central Asia after winning the Battle of Talas (along the Talas River in modern Talas Oblast, Kyrgyzstan) in 751, against the Chinese Tang dynasty. This conflict incidentally introduced Chinese papermaking to the Islamic world. The cultural consequences and political ramifications of this battle meant the retreat of the Chinese empire from Central Asia. It also allowed for the rise of the Samanid Empire (819–999), a Persian state centered at Bukhara (in what is now modern Uzbekistan) that nominally observed the Abbasids as their overlords, yet retained a great deal of autonomy and upheld the mercantile legacy of the Sogdians. Yet the Sogdian language gradually declined in favor of the Persian language of the Samanids (the ancestor to the modern Tajik language), the spoken language of renowned poets and intellectuals of the age such as Ferdowsi (940–1020). So too did the original religions of the Sogdians decline; Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Nestorian Christianity disappeared in the region by the end of the Samanid period. The Samanids were also responsible for converting the surrounding Turkic peoples to Islam.

====Samanids (819–999)====

The Samanids occupied the Sogdian region from circa 819 until 999, establishing their capital at Samarkand (819–892) and then at Bukhara (892–999).

===Turkic conquests: Kara-Khanid Khanate (999–1212)===

In 999 the Samanid Empire was conquered by an Islamic Turkic power, the Kara-Khanid Khanate (840–1212).

From 1212, the Kara-Khanids in Samarkand were conquered by the Kwarazmians. Soon however, Khwarezmia was invaded by the early Mongol Empire and its ruler Genghis Khan destroyed the once vibrant cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. However, in 1370, Samarkand saw a revival as the capital of the Timurid Empire. The Turko-Mongol ruler Timur brought about the forced immigration to Samarkand of artisans and intellectuals from across Asia, transforming it not only into a trade hub but also into one of the most important cities of the Islamic world.

==Economy and diplomacy==
=== Central Asia and the Silk Road ===
Most merchants did not travel the entire Silk Road, but would trade goods through middlemen based in oasis towns, such as Khotan or Dunhuang. The Sogdians, however, established a trading network across the 1500 miles from Sogdiana to China. In fact, the Sogdians turned their energies to trade so thoroughly that the Saka of the Kingdom of Khotan called all merchants &quot;suli&quot;, &quot;Sogdian&quot;, whatever their culture or ethnicity. The Sogdians had learnt to become expert traders from the Kushans, together with whom they initially controlled trade in the Ferghana Valley and Kangju during the &#x27;birth&#x27; of the Silk Road. Later, they became the primary middlemen after the demise of the Kushan Empire.

Unlike the empires of antiquity, the Sogdian region was not a territory confined within fixed borders, but rather a network of city-states, from one oasis to another, linking Sogdiana to Byzantium, India, Indochina and China. Sogdian contacts with China were initiated by the embassy of the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) of the former Han dynasty. Zhang wrote a report of his visit to the Western Regions in Central Asia and named the area of Sogdiana as &quot;Kangju&quot;.
Following Zhang Qian&#x27;s embassy and report, commercial Chinese relations with Central Asia and Sogdiana flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the 1st century BC. In his &quot;Shiji&quot; published in 94 BC, Chinese historian Sima Qian remarked that &quot;the largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members ... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out.&quot; In terms of the silk trade, the Sogdians also served as middlemen between the Chinese Han Empire and the Parthian Empire of the Middle East and West Asia. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade between China and Central Asia along the Silk Roads as late as the 10th century, their language serving as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for Asian trade as far back as the 4th century.


Subsequent to their domination by Alexander the Great, the Sogdians from the city of Marakanda (Samarkand) became dominant as traveling merchants, occupying a key position along the ancient Silk Road. They played an active role in the spread of faiths such as Manicheism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism along the Silk Road. The Chinese &quot;Sui Shu&quot; (&quot;Book of Sui&quot;) describes Sogdians as &quot;skilled merchants&quot; who attracted many foreign traders to their land to engage in commerce. They were described by the Chinese as born merchants, learning their commercial skills at an early age. It appears from sources, such as documents found by Sir Aurel Stein and others, that by the 4th century they may have monopolized trade between India and China. A letter written by Sogdian merchants dated 313 AD and found in the ruins of a watchtower in Gansu, was intended to be sent to merchants in Samarkand, warning them that after Liu Cong of Han-Zhao sacked Luoyang and the Jin emperor fled the capital, there was no worthwhile business there for Indian and Sogdian merchants. Furthermore, in 568 AD, a Turko-Sogdian delegation travelled to the Roman emperor in Constantinople to obtain permission to trade and in the following years commercial activity between the states flourished. Put simply, the Sogdians dominated trade along the Silk Road from the 2nd century BC until the 10th century.

Suyab and Talas in modern-day Kyrgyzstan were the main Sogdian centers in the north that dominated the caravan routes of the 6th to 8th centuries. Their commercial interests were protected by the resurgent military power of the Göktürks, whose empire was built on the political power of the Ashina clan and economic clout of the Sogdians. Sogdian trade, with some interruptions, continued into the 9th century. For instance, camels, women, girls, silver, and gold were seized from Sogdia during a raid by Qapaghan Qaghan (692–716), ruler of the Second Turkic Khaganate. In the 10th century, Sogdiana was incorporated into the Uighur Empire, which until 840 encompassed northern Central Asia. This khaganate obtained enormous deliveries of silk from Tang China in exchange for horses, in turn relying on the Sogdians to sell much of this silk further west. Peter B. Golden writes that the Uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the Sogdians, such as Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Christianity, but also looked to the Sogdians as &quot;mentors&quot;, while gradually replacing them in their roles as Silk Road traders and purveyors of culture. Muslim geographers of the 10th century drew upon Sogdian records dating to 750–840. After the end of the Uyghur Empire, Sogdian trade underwent a crisis. Following the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana in the 8th century, the Samanids resumed trade on the northwestern road leading to the Khazars and the Urals and the northeastern one toward the nearby Turkic tribes.

During the 5th and 6th century, many Sogdians took up residence in the Hexi Corridor, where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a &quot;Sabao&quot;, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught to read and write at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.

=== Trade and diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire ===
Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the First Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium&#x27;s capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.
It appears, however, that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited in light of the small amount of Roman and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although Roman embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) wrote that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 330 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball (2016) upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi&#x27;an, China (formerly Chang&#x27;an), dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold &quot;solidus&quot; coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage over the course of the 7th century. The fact that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans, confirms the pre-eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.

===Sogdian traders in the Tarim Basin===

The Kizil Caves near Kucha, mid-way in the Tarim Basin, record many scenes of traders from Central Asia in the 5–6th century: these combine influence from the Eastern Iran sphere, at that time occupied by the Sasanian Empire and the Hephthalites, with strong Sogdian cultural elements. Sogdia, at the center of a new Silk Road between China to the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire became extremely prosperous around that time.

The style of this period in Kizil is characterized by strong Iranian-Sogdian elements probably brought with intense Sogdian-Tocharian trade, the influence of which is especially apparent in the Central-Asian caftans with Sogdian textile designs, as well as Sogdian longswords of many of the figures. Other characteristic Sogdian designs are animals, such as ducks, within pearl medallions.


=== Sogdian merchants, generals, and statesmen in Imperial China ===
Aside from the Sogdians of Central Asia who acted as middlemen in the Silk Road trade, other Sogdians settled down in China for generations. Many Sogdians lived in Luoyang, capital of the Jin dynasty (266–420), but fled following the collapse of the Jin dynasty&#x27;s control over northern China in 311 AD and the rise of northern nomadic tribes.

Aurel Stein discovered 5 letters written in Sogdian known as the &quot;Ancient Letters&quot; in an abandoned watchtower near Dunhuang in 1907. One of them was written by a Sogdian woman named Miwnay who had a daughter named Shayn and she wrote to her mother Chatis in Sogdia. Miwnay and her daughter were abandoned in China by Nanai-dhat, her husband who was also Sogdian like her. Nanai-dhat refused to help Miwnay and their daughter after forcing them to come with him to Dunhuang and then abandoning them, telling them they should serve the Han Chinese. Miwnay asked one of her husband&#x27;s relative Artivan and then asked another Sogdian man, Farnkhund to help them but they also abandoned them. Miwnay and her daughter Shayn were then forced to became servants of Han Chinese after living on charity from a priest. Miwnay cursed her Sogdian husband for leaving her, saying she would rather have been married to a pig or dog. Another letter in the collection was written by the Sogdian Nanai-vandak addressed to Sogdians back home in Samarkand informing them about a mass rebellion by Xiongnu Hun rebels against their Han Chinese rulers of the Western Jin dynasty informing his people that every single one of the diaspora Sogdians and Indians in the Chinese Western Jin capital Luoyang died of starvation due to the uprising by the rebellious Xiongnu, who were formerly subjects of the Han Chinese. The Han Chinese emperor abandoned Luoyang when it came under siege by the Xiongnu rebels and his palace was burned down. Nanai-vandak also said the city of Ye was no more as the Xiongnu rebellion resulted in disaster for the Sogdian diaspora in China. Han Chinese men frequently bought Sogdian slave girls for sexual relations.
Still, some Sogdians continued living in Gansu. A community of Sogdians remained in the Northern Liang capital of Wuwei, but when the Northern Liang were defeated by the Northern Wei in 439 AD, many Sogdians were forcibly relocated to the Northern Wei capital of Datong, thereby fostering exchanges and trade for the new dynasty. Numerous Central Asian objects have been found in Northern Wei tombs, such as the tomb of Feng Hetu.

Other Sogdians came from the west and took positions in Chinese society. The &quot;Bei shi&quot; describes how a Sogdian came from Anxi (western Sogdiana or Parthia) to China and became a &quot;sabao&quot; (薩保, from Sanskrit &quot;sarthavaha&quot;, meaning caravan leader) who lived in Jiuquan during the Northern Wei (386 – 535 AD), and was the ancestor of An Tugen, a man who rose from a common merchant to become a top ranking minister of state for the Northern Qi (550 – 577 AD). Valerie Hansen asserts that around this time and extending into the Tang dynasty (618 – 907 AD), the Sogdians &quot;became the most influential of the non-Chinese groups resident in China&quot;. Two different types of Sogdians came to China, envoys and merchants. Sogdian envoys settled, marrying Chinese women, purchasing land, with newcomers living there permanently instead of returning to their homelands in Sogdiana. They were concentrated in large numbers around Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an, and also Xiangyang in present-day Hubei, building Zoroastrian temples to service their communities once they reached the threshold of roughly 100 households. From the Northern Qi to Tang periods, the leaders of these communities, the &quot;sabao&quot;, were incorporated into the official hierarchy of state officials.

During the 6–7th centuries AD, Sogdian families living in China created important tombs with funerary epitaphs explaining the history of their illustrious houses. Their burial practices blended both Chinese forms such as carved funerary beds with Zoroastrian sensibilities in mind, such as separating the body from both the earth and water. Sogdian tombs in China are among the most lavish of the period in this country, and are only inferior to Imperial tombs, suggesting that the Sogdian &quot;Sabao&quot; were among the wealthiest members of the population.
In addition to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose to the position of a military governor (&quot;jiedushi&quot;) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath many of them were slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that little is known about the Sogdian presence in North China since that time. The former Yan rebel general Gao Juren of Goguryeo descent ordered a mass slaughter of West Asian (Central Asian) Sogdians in Fanyang, also known as Jicheng (Beijing), in Youzhou identifying them through their big noses and lances were used to impale their children when he rebelled against the rebel Yan emperor Shi Chaoyi and defeated rival Yan dynasty forces under the Turk Ashina Chengqing, High nosed Sogdians were slaughtered in Youzhou in 761. Youzhou had Linzhou, another &quot;protected&quot; prefecture attached to it and Sogdians lived there in great numbers. because Gao Juren, like Tian Shengong wanted to defect to the Tang dynasty and wanted them to publicly recognize and acknowledge him as a regional warlord and offered the slaughter of the Central Asian Hu &quot;barbarians&quot; as a blood sacrifice for the Tang court to acknowledge his allegiance without him giving up territory. according to the book, &quot;History of An Lushan&quot; (安祿山史記). Another source says the slaughter of the Hu barbarians serving Ashina Chengqing was done by Gao Juren in Fanyang in order to deprive him of his support base, since the Tiele, Tongluo, Sogdians and Turks were all Hu and supported the Turk Ashina Chengqing against the Mohe, Xi, Khitan and Goguryeo origin soldiers led by Gao Juren. Gao Juren was later killed by Li Huaixian, who was loyal to Shi Chaoyi. A massacre of foreign Arab and Persian Muslim merchants by former Yan rebel general Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760), since Tian Shengong was defecting to the Tang dynasty and wanted them to publicly recognized and acknowledge him, and the Tang court portrayed the war as between rebel hu barbarians of the Yan against Han Chinese of the Tang dynasty, Tian Shengong slaughtered foreigners as a blood sacrifice to prove he was loyal to the Han Chinese Tang dynasty state and for them to recognize him as a regional warlord without him giving up territory, and he killed other foreign Hu barbarian ethnicities as well whose ethnic groups were not specified, not only Arabs and Persians since it was directed against all foreigners.

Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.

The Nestorian Christians like the Bactrian Priest Yisi of Balkh helped the Tang dynasty general Guo Ziyi militarily crush the An Lushan rebellion, with Yisi personally acting as a military commander and Yisi and the Nestorian Church of the East were rewarded by the Tang dynasty with titles and positions as described in the Nestorian Stele.

Amoghavajra used his rituals against An Lushan while staying in Chang&#x27;an when it was occupied in 756 while the Tang dynasty crown prince and Xuanzong emperor had retreated to Sichuan. Amoghavajra&#x27;s rituals were explicitly intended to introduced death, disaster and disease against An Lushan. As a result of Amoghavajrya&#x27;s assistance in crushing An Lushan, Estoteric Buddhism became the official state Buddhist sect supported by the Tang dynasty, &quot;Imperial Buddhism&quot; with state funding and backing for writing scriptures, and constructing monasteries and temples. The disciples of Amoghavajra did ceremonies for the state and emperor. Tang dynasty Emperor Suzong was crowned as cakravartin by Amoghavajra after victory against An Lushan in 759 and he had invoked the Acala vidyaraja against An Lushan. The Tang dynasty crown prince Li Heng (later Suzong) also received important strategic military information from Chang&#x27;an when it was occupied by An Lushan though secret message sent by Amoghavajra.

Epitaphs were found dating from the Tang dynasty of a Christian couple in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman, who Lady An (安氏) who died in 821 and her Nestorian Christian Han Chinese husband, Hua Xian (花献) who died in 827. These Han Chinese Christian men may have married Sogdian Christian women because of a lack of Han Chinese women belonging to the Christian religion, limiting their choice of spouses among the same ethnicity. Another epitaph in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman also surnamed An was discovered and she was put in her tomb by her military officer son on 22 January 815. This Sogdian woman&#x27;s husband was surnamed He (和) and he was a Han Chinese man and the family was indicated to be multiethnic on the epitaph pillar. In Luoyang, the mixed raced sons of Nestorian Christian Sogdian women and Han Chinese men has many career paths available for them. Neither their mixed ethnicity nor their faith were barriers and they were able to become civil officials, a military officers and openly celebrated their Christian religion and support Christian monasteries.
During the Tang and subsequent Five Dynasties and Song dynasty, a large community of Sogdians also existed in the multicultural &quot;entrepôt&quot; of Dunhuang, Gansu, a major center of Buddhist learning and home to the Buddhist Mogao Caves. Although Dunhuang and the Hexi Corridor were captured by the Tibetan Empire after the An Lushan Rebellion, in 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general Zhang Yichao (799–872) managed to wrestle control of the region from the Tibetans during their civil war, establishing the Guiyi Circuit under Emperor Xuānzong of Tang (r. 846–859). Although the region occasionally fell under the rule of different states, it retained its multilingual nature as evidenced by an abundance of manuscripts (religious and secular) in Chinese and Tibetan, but also Sogdian, Khotanese (another Eastern Iranian language native to the region), Uyghur, and Sanskrit.

There were nine prominent Sogdian clans (昭武九姓). The names of these clans have been deduced from the Chinese surnames listed in a Tang-era Dunhuang manuscript (Pelliot chinois 3319V). Each &quot;clan&quot; name refers to a different city-state as the Sogdian used the name of their hometown as their Chinese surname. Of these the most common Sogdian surname throughout China was Shí (石, generally given to those from Chach, modern Tashkent). The following surnames also appear frequently on Dunhuang manuscripts and registers: Shǐ (史, from Kesh, modern Shahrisabz), An (安, from Bukhara), Mi (米, from Panjakent), Kāng (康, from Samarkand), Cáo (曹, from Kabudhan, north of the Zeravshan River), and Hé (何, from Kushaniyah). Confucius is said to have expressed a desire to live among the &quot;nine tribes&quot; which may have been a reference to the Sogdian community.
The influence of Sinicized and multilingual Sogdians during this &quot;Guiyijun&quot; (歸義軍) period (c. 850 – c. 1000 AD) of Dunhuang is evident in a large number of manuscripts written in Chinese characters from left to right instead of vertically, mirroring the direction of how the Sogdian alphabet is read. Sogdians of Dunhuang also commonly formed and joined lay associations among their local communities, convening at Sogdian-owned taverns in scheduled meetings mentioned in their epistolary letters. Sogdians living in Turfan under the Tang dynasty and Gaochang Kingdom engaged in a variety of occupations that included: farming, military service, painting, leather crafting and selling products such as iron goods. The Sogdians had been migrating to Turfan since the 4th century, yet the pace of migration began to climb steadily with the Muslim conquest of Persia and Fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, followed by the Islamic conquest of Samarkand in 712.

== Language and culture ==
The 6th century is thought to be the peak of Sogdian culture, judging by its highly developed artistic tradition. By this point, the Sogdians were entrenched in their role as the central Asian traveling and trading merchants, transferring goods, culture and religion. During the Middle Ages, the valley of the Zarafshan around Samarkand retained its Sogdian name, Samarkand. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, medieval Arab geographers considered it one of the four fairest regions of the world. Where the Sogdians moved in considerable numbers, their language made a considerable impact. For instance, during China&#x27;s Han dynasty, the native name of the Tarim Basin city-state of Loulan was &quot;Kroraina&quot;, possibly from Greek due to nearby Hellenistic influence. However, centuries later in 664 AD, the Tang Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang labelled it as &quot;Nafupo&quot; (納縛溥), which according to Hisao Matsuda is a transliteration of the Sogdian word &quot;Navapa&quot; meaning &quot;new water&quot;.

=== Art ===

The Afrasiab paintings of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and events such as the arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects of their social and political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians&#x27; understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Iranian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the paintings of Samarkand and Panjakent.

=== Language ===
The Sogdians spoke an Eastern Iranian language called Sogdian, closely related to Bactrian, Khwarazmian, and the Khotanese Saka language, widely spoken Eastern Iranian languages of Central Asia in ancient times. Sogdian was also prominent in the oasis city-state of Turfan in the Tarim Basin region of Northwest China (in modern Xinjiang). Judging by the Sogdian Bugut inscription of Mongolia written c. 581, the Sogdian language was also an official language of the First Turkic Khaganate established by the Gokturks.

Sogdian was written largely in three scripts: the Sogdian alphabet, the Syriac alphabet, and the Manichaean alphabet, each derived from the Aramaic alphabet, which had been widely used in both the Achaemenid and Parthian empires of ancient Iran. The Sogdian alphabet formed the basis of the Old Uyghur alphabet of the 8th century, which in turn was used to create the Mongolian script of the early Mongol Empire during the 13th century. Later in 1599, the Jurchen leader Nurhaci decided to convert the Mongolian alphabet to make it suitable for the Manchu people.

The Yaghnobi people living in the Sughd province of Tajikistan still speak a descendant of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and Persians, and came to speak Persian. In 819, the Persian speaking population founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates can be found in the modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.

=== Clothing ===

Early medieval Sogdian costumes can be divided in two periods: Hephtalitic (5th and 6th centuries) and Turkic (7th and early 8th centuries). The latter did not become common immediately after the political dominance of the Gökturks but only in c. 620 when, especially following Western Turkic Khagan Ton-jazbgu&#x27;s reforms, Sogd was Turkized and the local nobility was officially included in the Khaganate&#x27;s administration.

For both sexes clothes were tight-fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were appreciated. The silhouettes for grown men and young girls emphasized wide shoulders and narrowed to the waist; the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more complicated. The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization in the ensuing centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common.

=== Religious beliefs ===

The Sogdians practiced a variety of religious faiths. However, Zoroastrianism was most likely their main religion, as demonstrated by material evidence, such as the discovery in Samarkand, Panjakent and Er-Kurgan of murals depicting votaries making offerings before fire altars and ossuaries holding the bones of the dead – in accordance with Zoroastrian ritual. At Turfan, Sogdian burials shared similar features with traditional Chinese practices, yet they still retained essential Zoroastrian rituals, such as allowing the bodies to be picked clean by scavengers before burying the bones in ossuaries. They also sacrificed animals to Zoroastrian deities, including the supreme deity Ahura Mazda. Zoroastrianism remained the dominant religion among Sogdians until after the Islamic conquest, when they gradually converted to Islam, as is shown by Richard Bulliet&#x27;s &quot;conversion curve&quot;.

One of the most widely worshiped deities in Sogdia was the goddess Nana, derived from the Mesopotamian goddess Nanaya, and is traditionally depicted as a 4 armed goddess riding a lion, holding the sun and moon. She and the river god Oxus were some of the most widely attested deities from the region. She was regarded as a civic and astral goddess, and her sacred city was Panjikent.
The Sogdian religious texts found in China and dating to the Northern dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist (translated from Chinese sources), Manichaean, and Nestorian Christian, with only a small minority of Zoroastrian texts. But, tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to the last third of the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian-Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and conservatively Zoroastrian.

However, the Sogdians epitomized the religious plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians were among the principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery to the north of Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts, and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The reconversion of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind evidence of their travels along the steep cliffs of the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, in hopes that the Buddha would grant them his protection.

The Sogdians also practiced Manichaeism, the faith of Mani, which they spread among the Uyghurs. The Uyghur Khaganate (744–840 AD) developed close ties to Tang China once it had aided the Tang in suppressing the rebellion of An Lushan and his Göktürk successor Shi Siming, establishing an annual trade relationship of one million bolts of Chinese silk for one hundred thousand horses. The Uyghurs relied on Sogdian merchants to sell much of this silk further west along the Silk Road, a symbiotic relationship that led many Uyghurs to adopt Manichaeism from the Sogdians. However, evidence of Manichaean liturgical and canonical texts of Sogdian origin remains fragmentary and sparse compared to their corpus of Buddhist writings. The Uyghurs were also followers of Buddhism. For instance, they can be seen wearing silk robes in the &quot;praṇidhi&quot; scenes of the Uyghur Bezeklik Buddhist murals of Xinjiang, China, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing Sogdian donors to the Buddha.
In addition to Puranic cults, there were five Hindu deities known to have been worshipped in Sogdiana. These were Brahma, Indra, Mahadeva (Shiva), Narayana, and Vaishravana; the gods Brahma, Indra, and Shiva were known by their Sogdian names Zravan, Adbad and Veshparkar, respectively., As seen in an 8th-century mural from Panjakent, portable fire altars can be &quot;associated&quot; with Mahadeva-Veshparkar, Brahma-Zravan, and Indra-Abdab, according to Braja Bihārī Kumar.

Among the Sogdian Christians known in China from inscriptions and texts were An Yena, a Christian from An country (Bukhara). Mi Jifen a Christian from Mi country (Maymurgh), Kang Zhitong, a Sogdian Christian cleric from Kang country (Samarkand), Mi Xuanqing a Sogdian Christian cleric from Mi country (Maymurgh), Mi Xuanying, a Sogdian Christian cleric from Mi country (Maymurgh), An Qingsu, a Sogdian Christian monk from An country (Bukhara).
When visiting Yuan-era Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China during the late 13th century, the Venetian explorer and merchant Marco Polo noted that a large number of Christian churches had been built there. His claim is confirmed by a Chinese text of the 14th century explaining how a Sogdian named Mar-Sargis from Samarkand founded six Nestorian Christian churches there, in addition to one in Hangzhou during the second half of the 13th century. Nestorian Christianity had existed in China earlier during the Tang dynasty when a Persian monk named Alopen came to Chang&#x27;an in 653 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an), dated to the year 781. Within the Syriac inscription is a list of priests and monks, one of whom is named Gabriel, the archdeacon of &quot;Xumdan&quot; and &quot;Sarag&quot;, the Sogdian names for the Chinese capital cities Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang, respectively. In regards to textual material, the earliest Christian gospel texts translated into Sogdian coincide with the reign of the Sasanian Persian monarch Yazdegerd II (r. 438–457), and were translated from the &quot;Peshitta&quot;, the standard version of the Bible in Syriac Christianity.

==Slave trade ==

Slavery existed in China since ancient times, although during the Han dynasty the proportion of slaves to the overall population was roughly 1%, far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco-Roman world (estimated at 15% of the entire population). During the Tang period, slaves were not allowed to marry a commoner&#x27;s daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female member of their master&#x27;s family, and although fornication with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law, it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master&#x27;s son, which allowed for her elevation to the legal status of a commoner, yet she could only live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master.
Sogdian and Chinese merchants regularly traded in slaves in and around Turpan during the Tang dynasty. Turpan under Tang dynasty rule was a center of major commercial activity between Chinese and Sogdian merchants. There were many inns in Turpan. Some provided Sogdian sex workers with an opportunity to service the Silk Road merchants, since the official histories report that there were markets in women at Kucha and Khotan. The Sogdian-language contract buried at the Astana graveyard demonstrates that at least one Chinese man bought a Sogdian girl in 639 AD. One of the archaeologists who excavated the Astana site, Wu Zhen, contends that, although many households along the Silk Road bought individual slaves, as demonstrated in the earlier documents from Niya, the Turpan documents point to a massive escalation in the volume of the slave trade. In 639 a female Sogdian slave was sold to a Chinese man, as recorded in an Astana cemetery legal document written in Sogdian. Khotan and Kucha were places where women were commonly sold, with ample evidence of the slave trade in Turfan thanks to contemporary textual sources that have survived. In Tang poetry Sogdian girls also frequently appear as serving maids in the taverns and inns of the capital Chang&#x27;an.

Sogdian slave girls and their Chinese male owners made up the majority of Sogdian female-Chinese male pairings, while free Sogdian women were the most common spouse of Sogdian men. A smaller number of Chinese women were paired with elite Sogdian men. Sogdian man-and-woman pairings made up eighteen out of twenty-one marriages according to existing documents.

A document dated 731 AD reveals that precisely forty bolts of silk were paid to a certain Mi Lushan, a slave dealing Sogdian, by a Chinese man named Tang Rong (唐榮) of Chang&#x27;an, for the purchase of an eleven-year-old girl. A person from Xizhou, a Tokharistani (i.e. Bactrian), and three Sogdians verified the sale of the girl.

Central Asians like Sogdians were called &quot;Hu&quot; (胡) by the Chinese during the Tang dynasty. Central Asian &quot;Hu&quot; women were stereotyped as barmaids or dancers by Han in China. Han Chinese men engaged in mostly extra-marital sexual relationships with them as the &quot;Hu&quot; women in China mostly occupied positions where sexual services were sold to patrons like singers, maids, slaves and prostitutes. Southern Baiyue girls were exoticized in poems. Han men did not want to legally marry them unless they had no choice such as if they were on the frontier or in exile since the Han men would be socially disadvantaged and have to marry non-Han. The task of taking care of herd animals like sheep and cattle was given to &quot;Hu&quot; slaves in China.

== Modern historiography ==
In 1916, the French Sinologist and historian Paul Pelliot used Tang Chinese manuscripts excavated from Dunhuang, Gansu to identify an ancient Sogdian colony south of Lop Nur in Xinjiang (Northwest China), which he argued was the base for the spread of Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity in China. In 1926, Japanese scholar Kuwabara compiled evidence for Sogdians in Chinese historical sources, and by 1933, Chinese historian Xiang Da published his &quot;Tang Chang&#x27;an and Central Asian Culture&quot;, detailing the Sogdian influence on Chinese social religious life in the Tang-era Chinese capital city. 

The Canadian Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank published an article in 1952, demonstrating the presence of a Sogdian colony founded in Six Hu Prefectures of the Ordos Loop during the Chinese Tang period, composed of Sogdians and Turkic peoples who migrated from the Mongolian steppe. The Japanese historian Ikeda on wrote an article in 1965, outlining the history of the Sogdians inhabiting Dunhuang from the beginning of the 7th century, analyzing lists of their Sinicized names and the role of Zoroastrianism and Buddhism in their religious life. Yoshida Yutaka and Kageyama Etsuko, Japanese ethnographers and linguists of the Sogdian language, were able to reconstruct Sogdian names from forty-five different Chinese transliterations, noting that these were common in Turfan whereas Sogdians living closer to the center of Chinese civilization for generations adopted traditional Chinese names.

<text>Cudham is an area in Greater London, England, located within the London Borough of Bromley and beyond London&#x27;s urban sprawl. It is located on the Greater London border with Kent, bordering the Sevenoaks District. Cudham lies south of Orpington and north west of Sevenoaks. It is located south-southeast of Charing Cross.

==History==
Cudham church, dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, is mentioned in the Domesday Book.

Lord Simon de Manning, a former Lord of the Manor for Kevington, London, and holder of the land which now includes Cudham, was a Grandson of Rudolph de Manning, Count Palatine, (who, married Elgida, aunt to King Harold I, (Harold Harefoot), of England); he was the royal Standard Bearer to King Richard the Lionheart, who carried the royal Standard to Jerusalem in 1190, during the First Crusade. In England, the forms Earl Palatine and Palatine Earldom are preferred.

The &quot;Blacksmith&#x27;s Arms&quot;, originally a 17th-century farmhouse, has memorabilia relating to the music hall artiste known as &quot;Little Tich&quot;. Cudham was part of Bromley Rural District from 1894 and Orpington Urban District from 1934 to 1965. The village was therefore part of Kent (and administered by Kent County Council) until the creation of Greater London on 1 April 1965. Cudham Recreation Ground, behind the church and pub, is home to Cudham Wyse Cricket Club, which was formed in 1965.

==Transport==
Cudham, being in the county of Greater London, is still under the Transport for London remit and is served by a London Buses bus service, with the R5/R10 connecting the area with Orpington via Green Street Green, and also to Knockholt in Kent. The closest rail links to the area are Chelsfield station and Knockholt station, in Travelcard Zone 6.

==Events==
Cudham hosts one of the oldest village shows and fetes, dating back to Victorian times. It is held annually on the August Bank Holiday Monday.

Cudham also hosts the famous annual Cudham Craic music festival, a popular two day music event in Cudham&#x27;s recreation ground.

==Local politics==

Cudham is part of the largest ward in Greater London, Darwin (ward), covering a rural area including Downe, Leaves Green, Berry&#x27;s Green, Single Street, and Westerham Hill.

Since 2019, the local Member of Parliament is Gareth Bacon, elected with 30,882 votes or 63.4% of the vote share. Previously, the local Member of Parliament has been Jo Johnson of the Conservatives who is brother of the former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. 

By a numerical majority of 22,378 votes (45.9%), Orpington is the safest Conservative Parliamentary seat in London.

One councillor is elected every four years to Bromley London Borough Council. To date, the Darwin ward has only been represented by representatives from the Conservative Party.

<text>Dalston () is an area of East London, in the London Borough of Hackney. It is northeast of Charing Cross. Dalston began as a hamlet on either side of Dalston Lane, and as the area urbanised the term also came to apply to surrounding areas including Kingsland and Shacklewell, all three of which being part of the Ancient Parish of Hackney.

The area has experienced a high degree of gentrification in recent years, a process accelerated by the East London line extension, now part of London Overground, and the reopening of Dalston Junction railway station, part of London&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics.

==Bounds==
Dalston has never been an administrative unit, and partly for this reason the boundaries are not formally defined. There are generally understood boundaries in the south and west, but less clarity to the north and east. There is an electoral ward of the same name which covers a part of the northwest of Dalston.

Dalston&#x27;s boundaries (taking in Kingsland and Shacklewell, but not De Beauvoir Town, which is also sometimes associated with Dalston) are described with more or less precision below:
* South: Dalston takes Hackney&#x27;s southern border with Shoreditch. Albion Drive forms much of this boundary.
* West: The originally Roman A10 road (under the names, south to north: Kingsland Road, Kingsland High St, Stoke Newington Road) is widely understood as Dalston&#x27;s western margin. The exception is that both sides of Kingsland High St are included – here Dalston takes Hackney&#x27;s western boundary as it crosses the A10 to take in a small area bounded by Boleyn Road and the Crossway, to include Dalston Kingsland Railway Station. The western boundary corresponds with the western side of the E8 postal area with which Dalston is associated, though postcodes are not intended to define districts, and the postal area also takes in areas that are not ever described as part of Dalston.
* North: There is not a tradition of a clear northern boundary with West Hackney. Dalston&#x27;s association with the E8 postal area means that its &#x27;sphere of self-identification&#x27; does not extend far, if at all, beyond the postcode boundary, and no further north than Farleigh Road.
* East: Between Downs Road and Amhurst Road, the physical barrier of the railway embankment marks the postcode boundary with Lower Clapton. There is little tradition of a boundary with the central Hackney area except that it is sometimes said that Dalston extends as far as the park at London Fields.

==History==
The name Dalston is thought to have derived from &quot;Deorlaf&#x27;s tun&quot; (farm) in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of &quot;Hoch&quot;. The first written record available is from 1294 when the name was written as Derleston.

The village was one of four small villages within the Parish of Hackney (along with Newington, Shacklewell, and Kingsland) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the village of Hackney.

John Rocque&#x27;s map of 1746 shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane. Another clear feature is Roman Ermine Street which now forms most of the western boundary of this area. Ermine Street now has the road number A10 and goes by a number of names, including Kingsland Road as it travels through London.

Around 1280 CE a leper hospital was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.

During the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to an urban one. By 1849, it was described as &quot;a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses&quot;, and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.

During the 1930s, 1940s and 1960s the area&#x27;s large Jewish and other minority populations made it a target for provocative rallies by Oswald Mosley and the various organisations he founded. These were actively opposed by many local people, together with organisations such as the 43 Group in the 1940s and the 62 Group from 1962, and this led to a number of violent confrontations, notably in the Ridley Road and Hertford Road areas. A 2014 novel, &quot;Ridley Road&quot;, and its BBC One TV adaptation uses the clashes as a backdrop to the narrative.

In July 2017 a riot broke out on Dalston Road, which had originally started as a demonstration against police violence. Protesters barricaded the spot where a man, who later died at the Royal London Hospital, had been arrested. The rioters threw fire bombs at police and caused property damage.

===Administrative history===
The Ancient Parish of Hackney, of which Dalston was a part, detached from Stepney in the Middle Ages and had consistent boundaries from that time on. 

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets), a historic ‘county within a county’, under the leadership of the Lord-Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets (the post was always filled by the Constable of the Tower of London). The military loyalty to the Tower meant local men served in the Tower garrison and Tower Hamlets Militia, rather than the Middlesex Militia. This arrangement lasted until 1900.

In 1900 the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney was formed, using the boundaries of the former parish, and it became part of the County of London. In 1965 Hackney merged with the boroughs of Shoreditch and Stoke Newington to form the modern London Borough of Hackney, part of a new larger county of Greater London.

==Notable buildings==
St. Mark&#x27;s is a large Victorian church primarily built in the period 1864–66 to a design by Chester Cheston. It is reputedly the largest parish church in London, larger than Southwark Cathedral, capable of hosting congregations of 1800–2000 people and its great size has earned it the nickname, the &quot;Cathedral of the East End&quot;. The residential area around the church is also of high architectural quality and has accordingly been designated the &quot;St. Mark&#x27;s Conservation Area&quot;.

The Rio Cinema is a Grade II listed independent Art Deco cinema. It is a popular single-screen cinema located on Kingsland High Street, with a history stretching back over 100 years.

The German Hospital, locally known as &#x27;The German&#x27;, is a group of attractive Victorian red brick buildings that were home to a hospital from 1845 to 1987. The hospital was initially founded to cater primarily for London&#x27;s then large German-speaking community. It eventually became an ordinary NHS facility before its facilities were merged and moved to Homerton University Hospital.

==Festivals==
Dalston is known for music, events and its nightlife. Its biggest festival to date began in 2015, Dalston Music Festival. Centred on Gillett Square and 8 clubs in the surrounding area, it was founded by Andrew Bunsell of Dalston Studios.

==Arts and entertainment==
Dalston hosts several art and entertainment venues, and has a history as an entertainment centre, with at one time hosting four or five cinemas within a radius of , and the Dalston Theatre, a former hippodrome and music hall that later became the Four Aces blues club and the Labyrinth nightclub. The Dalston Theatre was demolished in February 2007, despite an active local campaign to save it. Dalston was also a hub for 1970s and 1980s pub rock venues but these are largely defunct.

==Shopping==

Established in the 1880s, Ridley Road Market is opposite Dalston Kingsland railway station. Fruit and vegetables, some fairly exotic, are available. Halal butchers cluster around the high street end of the market.

Ridley Road market is reputedly the basis for the one found in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The Kingsland Shopping Centre (formerly Dalston Cross) is just south of Ridley Road Market.
Kingsland Road and the surrounding streets are home to an ever-growing number of boutiques, bars and cafés.

==Area profile==

Contemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th- and 19th-century terraced houses and 20th-century council estates. It is currently undergoing rapid gentrification, partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at Dalston Junction and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics. (Hackney was one of the four host boroughs of the Games.)

Dalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived Jewish people from central Europe. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.

Fassett Square was the inspiration for the BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square (Albert Square) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both Barbara Windsor and Tony Holland, one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.

The Hackney Peace Carnival Mural created in 1985, depicts a group of people marching for peace against &quot;the bomb&quot; and has become an important cultural statement from that era. It can be found opposite Dalston Junction Overground station on Dalston Lane. It has also been used on the cover of an album by local group Rudimental.

Music hall artist Marie Lloyd (1870–1922) used to reside on Graham Road. The house now has a blue plaque.

In April 2009 &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article on Dalston claiming that it was the &quot;coolest&quot; place to live in Britain. In the same year however, sculpture park The Towers of Hackney was torn down to give way to new buildings.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Dalston is on the London Overground network, served by three stations:
*Dalston Kingsland – for London Overground services between Stratford and Richmond or Clapham Junction. This provides Dalston with a direct rail link to Hackney Central, Highbury &amp; Islington, Camden Road, Willesden Junction and destinations in West London.
* Dalston Junction – for London Overground services between Highbury &amp; Islington and either West Croydon, Crystal Palace, New Cross or Clapham Junction. This gives the area a direct rail connection to Shoreditch, Whitechapel, Canada Water and destinations in South London.
* Haggerston – partly in the district, served by London Overground trains between Highbury &amp; Islington and West Croydon, Crystal Palace, New Cross or Clapham Junction.

All stations are in London fare zone 2, and Oyster Cards are valid for travel from Dalston to other destinations in London. Dalston Junction is the busiest station of the three, with 5.677 million passenger entries and exits at the station in 2017–2018.

There is no direct rail link to Central London, and Dalston is not on the London Underground network. Direct connections to London&#x27;s Zone 1 can be found at Hackney Central and Highbury &amp; Islington stations. A new station in Dalston has been proposed as part of the Crossrail 2 development.

=== Buses ===
Dalston is served by London Buses on routes 30, 38, 56, 67, 76, 149, 236, 242, 243, 277, 488 and N38. Routes 76, 149, 242, 243 and 277 run 24-hours, daily.

Dalston Bus Garage on Shrubland Road has been demolished.

==== Air Pollution ====
The London Borough of Hackney measures roadside air quality in Dalston, in particular the concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the district. Diffusion tubes which measure the concentration of NO2 in roadside air show that across Dalston, the local roadside air quality failed to meet the UK National Objective of 40μg/m3 (micrograms per cubic metre) in 2017.

In 2017, the average roadside NO2 levels in several key locations in Dalston were:
* Dalston Lane (A104) – 63 μg/m3
* Kingsland High Street (A10) – 62 μg/m3
* Kingsland Road (A10) – 52 μg/m3
* Dalston Library – 39 μg/m3 (which meets the UK National Air Quality objective)

=== Cycling ===
Cycling infrastructure is maintained and managed in Dalston by the London Borough of Hackney and Transport for London (TfL).

Several key routes pass through the district, including:
* Cycle Superhighway 1 (CS1) – an unbroken, signposted route running on residential streets, north–south through Dalston. Northbound, the route carries cyclists to Stoke Newington, Seven Sisters and Tottenham. Southbound, the route passes through De Beauvior Town and Hoxton &quot;en route&quot; to Moorgate in the City.
* Quietway 2 (Q2) – an unbroken, signposted route running on quieter streets or shared-use paths, east–west through Dalston. Westbound, the route runs to Bloomsbury via Canonbury, Angel and Finsbury. Eastbound, Q2 runs to Walthamstow via London Fields and Clapton.

Also nearby, there is a signed cycle route through Shacklewell from Hackney Downs to the east, to Clissold Park and Finsbury Park to the northwest. The Regent&#x27;s Canal towpath passes through neighbouring Haggerston, which runs unbroken from Limehouse to Angel, via Mile End.

<text>Deptford is an area on the south bank of the River Thames in southeast London, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich and London Borough of Lewisham. It is named after a ford of the River Ravensbourne. From the mid 16th century to the late 19th it was home to Deptford Dockyard, the first of the Royal Dockyards. This was a major shipbuilding dock and attracted Peter the Great to come and study shipbuilding. Deptford and the docks are associated with the knighting of Sir Francis Drake by Queen Elizabeth I aboard the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, the legend of Sir Walter Raleigh laying down his cape for Elizabeth, Captain James Cook&#x27;s third voyage aboard HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, and the mysterious apparent murder of Christopher Marlowe in a house along Deptford Strand.

Though Deptford began as two small communities, one at the ford, and the other a fishing village on the Thames, Deptford&#x27;s history and population has been mainly associated with the docks established by Henry VIII. The two communities grew together and flourished during the period when the docks were the main administrative centre of the Royal Navy, and some grand houses like Sayes Court, home to diarist John Evelyn, and Stone House on Lewisham Way, were erected. The area declined as first the Royal Navy moved out, and then the commercial docks themselves declined until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.

A Metropolitan Borough of Deptford existed from 1900 until 1965, when the area became part of the newly created London Borough of Lewisham.

==History==
Deptford took its name from a ford across the Ravensbourne (near what is now Deptford Bridge DLR station) along the route of the Celtic trackway which was later paved by the Romans and developed into the medieval Watling Street. The modern name is a corruption of &quot;deep ford&quot;.

Deptford was part of the pilgrimage route from London to Canterbury used by the pilgrims in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, and is mentioned in the prologue to &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The ford developed into first a wooden then a stone bridge, and in 1497 saw the Battle of Deptford Bridge, in which rebels from Cornwall, led by Michael An Gof, marched on London protesting against punitive taxes, but were soundly beaten by the King&#x27;s forces.
A second settlement, Deptford Strand or Deptford Strond, developed as a modest fishing village on the Thames until Henry VIII used that site for a royal dock repairing, building and supplying ships, after which it grew in size and importance, shipbuilding remaining in operation until March 1869. 

Trinity House, the organisation concerned with the safety of navigation around the British Isles, was formed in Deptford in 1514, with its first Master being Thomas Spert, captain of the Mary Rose. It moved to Stepney in 1618. The name &quot;Trinity House&quot; derives from the church of Holy Trinity and St Clement, which adjoined the dockyard.

Originally separated by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming an important part of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade – the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became an important part of the abolition of the slave trade, was sold from one ship&#x27;s captain to another in Deptford around 1760.

Diarist John Evelyn lived in Deptford at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford, from 1652 after he had married the daughter of the owner of the house, Sir Richard Browne. After the Restoration, Evelyn obtained a 99-year lease of the house and grounds, and laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Peter the Great, the Russian tsar, studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698 while staying at Sayes Court. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the tsar, who got drunk with his friends who, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed their way through a &quot;fine holly hedge&quot;. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy Victualling Yard, which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All that remains is the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualling Yard.

The Docks had been gradually declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found the Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under competition from the new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 the need for a Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until 1913 the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation&#x27;s Foreign Cattle Market, to which live animals were brought by cattle boat from four continents and from whence came about half of London&#x27;s meat supply.

The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.

Deptford experienced economic decline in the 20th century with the closing of the docks, and the damage caused by the bombing during the Blitz in the Second World War – a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store in New Cross Gate, killing 160 people. High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.

==Governance==

The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was bestowed by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, bishop of Lisieux, one of the eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford. The location of the building is not known, but ancient foundations found on the brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court may be the remains of the building.
Deptford was mostly located in the Blackheath Hundred of the county of Kent, with the Hatcham part in the Brixton Hundred of Surrey.

In 1730 Deptford was divided into the two parishes of St Nicholas and St Paul. It was also referred to as West Greenwich, with the modern town of Greenwich being referred to as East Greenwich until this use declined in the 19th century. The whole of Deptford came within the Metropolitan Police District in 1830 and was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855.

It was transferred to the County of London in 1889. Originally under the governance of the ancient parishes of St Paul and St Nicholas, in 1900, a Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was formed out of the southern parish of St Paul, with St Nicholas and the area around the Royal Dockyard coming under the governance of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich.

Under the London Government Act 1963, the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was absorbed in 1965 into the newly created London Borough of Lewisham, with the Deptford St Nicholas area becoming part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, with both these new boroughs now forming part of the new Greater London body. In 1994 the bulk of the northern part, including the former Royal Dockyard area, was transferred to Lewisham, an adjustment of about , leaving only the north eastern area, around St Nicholas&#x27;s church, in Greenwich.

Deptford is split between two electoral wards - Evelyn in the north and part of New Cross to the south. Following public consultation, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England recommended in June 2020 that the Deptford wards (Evelyn and New Cross) should be unified and renamed Deptford.

==Geography==
Deptford borders the areas of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross to the west and Rotherhithe to the north west; the Ravensbourne river divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the Thames separates the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is the only part of the London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some southern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.

The name Deptford – anciently written Depeford meaning &quot;deep ford&quot; — is derived from the place where the road from London to Dover, the ancient Watling Street (now the A2), crosses the River Ravensbourne at the site of what became Deptford Bridge at Deptford Broadway. The Ravensbourne crosses under the A2 at roughly the same spot as the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) crosses over; and at the point where it becomes tidal, just after Lewisham College, it is known as Deptford Creek, and flows into the River Thames at Greenwich Reach.

==Demography==
Deptford&#x27;s population has been mainly associated with the docks since the establishment of the Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though there has also been some market gardening and potteries. When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.

There was a start of a demographic shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and the docks moved into storage and freight. The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population&#x27;s dependency on the docks continued: as the docks themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.

In common with neighbouring areas of South East London, immigrants from the Caribbean settled in Deptford in the 1950s and 1960s.

Deptford&#x27;s northern section nearest the old docks contains areas of council housing, with some concentrations of people experiencing the forms of deprivation typically associated with the poverty of Inner London. Northern Deptford near the Thames, along with neighbouring New Cross, has been touted as &quot;the new Shoreditch&quot; by some journalists and estate agents paying attention to a trendy arts and music scene that is popular with students and artists. To the south where Deptford rolls into the suburban spread of Brockley, the previously multi-occupancy Victorian houses are being gentrified by young city workers and urban professionals. Deptford has a growing Vietnamese community reflected in the number of restaurants in the area.

Deptford contains a number of student populations, including those of Goldsmiths College, the University of Greenwich, Bellerbys College and Laban Dance Centre. Goldsmiths College&#x27;s hall of residence, Rachel McMillan, in Creek Road was sold in 2001 for £79 million, and was subsequently demolished and replaced with the McMillan Student Village which opened in 2003 and provides accommodation for approximately 970 students of the University of Greenwich, Trinity Laban and Bellerbys colleges.

==Economy==
Deptford&#x27;s economic history has been strongly connected to the Dockyard - when the Dockyard was thriving, so Deptford thrived; with the docks now all closed, Deptford has declined economically. However, areas of Deptford are being gradually re-developed and gentrified - and the local council has plans to regenerate the riverside and the town centre. A large former industrial site by the Thames called Convoys Wharf is scheduled for redeveloping into mixed use buildings. This will involve the construction of around 3,500 new homes and an extension of the town centre northwards towards the river.

The site of a former foundry (established in 1881 by J. Stone &amp; Co in Arklow Road) which closed in 1969 is being redeveloped for commercial and residential use.

Much of the area along Creek Road, close to Greenwich, has also been redeveloped, with the demolition of the old Deptford Power Station and Rose Bruford College buildings. Aragon Tower on the Pepys Estate was sold by Lewisham Borough to fund regeneration plans for the estate; the award-winning refurbishment into privately owned accommodation was featured in the BBC One documentary, &quot;The Tower&quot;.

Deptford Market, a street market in Deptford High Street sells a range of goods, and is considered one of London&#x27;s liveliest street markets. In February 2005, the High Street was described as &quot;the capital&#x27;s most diverse and vibrant high street&quot; by Yellow Pages business directory, using a unique mathematical formula.

==Culture==
The Albany Theatre, a community arts centre with a tradition of &quot;radical community arts and music&quot; including holding 15 &quot;Rock Against Racism&quot; concerts, has its roots in a charity established in 1894 to improve the social life of Deptford&#x27;s deprived community. The original building, the Albany Institute, was opened in 1899 on Creek Road, changing its name in the 1960s to the Albany Empire. It was burnt down in 1978, but rebuilt on Douglas Way, with Prince Charles laying the foundation stone, and Diana, Princess of Wales opening it in 1982.

Deptford Cinema is a volunteer run, not-for-profit, community cinema, art gallery, and occasional music venue, open since late 2014 and located at 39 Deptford Broadway. At the time of opening it was the borough of Lewisham&#x27;s only functioning cinema.

Creekside, a regeneration area beside Deptford Creek, is used for educational and artistic purposes, such as the Laban Dance Centre, which was designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and opened in February 2003; and the Art in Perpetuity Trust (APT) gallery and studio space. In 2002 the Creekside Discovery Centre was established to retain some urban habitat that was being destroyed through the area&#x27;s regeneration. A record label, Deptford Fun City Records was set up by Miles Copeland III, brother of Stewart Copeland, in the late 1970s as an outlet for Deptford bands such as Alternative TV and Squeeze.

The area has several pubs, including the &quot;Dog &amp; Bell&quot; which has a reputation for serving a range of cask ales, &quot;The Royal Albert&quot; which is a Grade II listed building from the mid-19th century that was previously known as The Paradise Bar and saw early gigs by Bloc Party and Art Brut, and &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot; which has live music, film and art performances from local bands and artists. The town hall of the former Metropolitan Borough of Deptford, built in 1905 with decorative sculpture by Henry Poole, lies just outside Deptford, on the New Cross Road in New Cross. It was purchased by Goldsmiths College in 2000.

There are several green spaces in the area, the largest being Brookmill Park, Deptford Park, Ferranti Park, Pepys Park and Sayes Court Park. In 1884 William John Evelyn, a descendant of John Evelyn, sold ground then being used as market gardens in Deptford, to the London County Council for less than its market value, as well as paying toward the cost of its purchase. It was officially opened to the public as Deptford Park on 7 June 1897. In 1886, he dedicated an acre and a half of the Sayes Court recreation ground in perpetuity to the public and a permanent provision was made for the Evelyn estate to cover the expense of maintenance and caretaking, this was opened on 20 July 1886.

==Transport==
Deptford is served by National Rail and Docklands Light Railway services. The National Rail service is operated by Southeastern and Thameslink on the suburban Greenwich Line at Deptford railway station, the oldest passenger-only railway station in London. Deptford station was redeveloped during 2011 and 2012. The works included the demolition of the original 1836 station building and its replacement by a new station to the west in the former station yard. Deptford&#x27;s DLR station is at Deptford Bridge on the DLR&#x27;s Lewisham branch.

There are two main road routes through Deptford: the A200 which runs along Evelyn Street and Creek Road, and the A2 which runs along New Cross Road, and is the modern version of the Celtic trackway which was later paved by the Romans and developed into the medieval Watling Street. The A20 marks the southern boundary of the area, along Lewisham Way and Loampit Vale.

Since June 2016, Deptford has been on the cycling route of the London Quietway route Q1 that starts in Greenwich and ends near Waterloo Bridge in central London. A second Quietway route, Q14, between Waterloo and Thamesmead, passes through Deptford&#x27;s riverfront.

==Education==
There are five primary schools in the area. There are no local secondary schools directly in Deptford, however there are two secondary schools near the border between New Cross and Deptford: Deptford Green, regarded by Ofsted as &quot;needing improvement&quot;, and Addey and Stanhope, regarded by Ofsted as &quot;good&quot;. A branch of the further education college, Lewisham College incorporating Southwark College (known as LeSoCo), is located on Deptford Church Street; the college was regarded as &quot;inadequate&quot; in the 2014 Ofsted inspection.

==Landmarks==
Deptford railway station is one of the oldest suburban stations in the world, being built (c.1836-38) as part of the first suburban service (the London and Greenwich Railway), between London Bridge and Greenwich. Close to Deptford Creek is a Deptford pumping station, a Victorian pumping station built in 1864, part of the massive London sewerage system designed by civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette.

The former Deptford Power Station, in use from 1891 to 1983, originated as a pioneering plant designed by Sebastian de Ferranti, which when built was the largest station in the world.

In 2008, Lewisham Council granted permission for the last remnants of the Deptford Ragged School known as The Princess Louise Institute to be demolished and replaced by flats.

Albury Street (previously Union Street) contains a fine row of early urban houses largely dating from 1705 to 1717 which were once popular with naval captains and shipwrights.

Tanners Hill in the St John&#x27;s or New Deptford area to the south of New Cross Road, is part of an Area of Archaeological Priority due to the longevity of settlement and early industry, and contains a set of commercial buildings from numbers 21 to 31 which are survivors from a row of 31 which were built in the 1750s on the site of cottages dating from the 17th century.

These timber-frame buildings have a Grade II listing from English Heritage and are home to established businesses such as bicycle maker Witcomb Cycles. Of Deptford&#x27;s two important houses, Sayes Court no longer exists, but the Stone House in St Johns, built around 1772 by the architect George Gibson the Younger, and described by Pevsner as &quot;the one individual house of interest in this area&quot;, still stands by Lewisham Way.

Deptford&#x27;s Albany Theatre has a history stretching back over 100 years and is a prominent feature of the South-East London arts scene.

===Churches===
St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, the original parish church, dates back to the 14th century but the current building is 17th century. The entrance to the churchyard features a set of skull-and-bones on top of the posts. A plaque on the north wall commemorates playwright Christopher Marlowe, who was stabbed to death by Ingram Frizer in a nearby house, and buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard on 1 June 1593. Frizer was pardoned for the killing on the grounds that he acted in self-defence.

There is also St. Luke&#x27;s, another historic circular church, dating from 1870. It is the daughter church of the parish of St Nicholas&#x27;.

In the 18th century St. Paul&#x27;s, Deptford (1712–1730) was built, acclaimed by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England as one of the finest Baroque churches in the country. John Betjeman is attributed as referring to the church as &quot;a pearl at the heart of Deptford&quot;. It was designed by the architect Thomas Archer, who was a pupil of Sir Christopher Wren, as part of the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches with the intention of instilling pride in Britain, and encouraging people to stay in London rather than emigrate to the New World.

Adjacent to the church yard is Albury Street, which contains some fine 18th-century houses which were popular with sea captains and shipbuilders.

===Deptford Dockyard===

Deptford Dockyard was established in 1513 by Henry VIII as the first Royal Dockyard, building vessels for the Royal Navy, and was at one time known as the King&#x27;s Yard. It was shut down from 1830 to 1844 before being closed as a dockyard in 1869, and is currently known as Convoys Wharf. From 1871 until the First World War it was the City of London Corporation&#x27;s Foreign Cattle Market. In 1912, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that over 4 million head of live cattle, and sheep, had been landed.

From 1932 until 2008 the site was owned by News International, which used it to import newsprint and other paper products from Finland until early 2000. It is now owned by Hutchison Whampoa Limited and is subject to a planning application to convert it into residential units, though it has safeguarded wharf status.

Other notable shipyards in Deptford were Charles Lungley&#x27;s Dockyard and the General Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s yards at Deptford Green and Dudman&#x27;s Dock, also sometimes referred to as &quot;Deadmans Dock&quot; at Deptford Wharf.
==Murder of Christopher Marlowe==


The Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe was killed during an alleged drunken brawl in Eleanor Bull&#x27;s house in Deptford Strand in May 1593. Various versions of Marlowe&#x27;s death were current at the time. Francis Meres says Marlowe was &quot;stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love&quot; as punishment for his &quot;epicurism and atheism&quot;. In 1917, in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Sir Sidney Lee wrote that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight. Some modern theories posit that he was assassinated. It is commonly assumed that the fight took place in a Deptford tavern.

The scholar Leslie Hotson discovered in 1925 the coroner&#x27;s report on Marlowe&#x27;s death in the Public Record Office which gave fuller details. Marlowe had spent all day in a house owned by the widow Eleanor Bull, along with three men, Ingram Frizer, Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. Witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had earlier argued over the bill, exchanging &quot;divers malicious words.&quot; Later, while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch, Marlowe snatched Frizer&#x27;s dagger and began attacking him. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner&#x27;s report, Marlowe was accidentally stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Deptford, on 1 June 1593.

==Notable people==

Among people associated with Deptford are Christopher Marlowe, who was stabbed to death at Deptford Strand; diarist John Evelyn (1620–1706), who lived at Sayes Court, and had Peter the Great (1672–1725) as a guest for about three months in 1698; Sir Francis Drake, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I aboard the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; in Deptford Docks; and Emperor Norton (Joshua Abraham Norton), the San Francisco eccentric and self-proclaimed &quot;Emperor of the United States&quot;, who was born in Deptford in 1818.

Other people who have lived in Deptford range from the first governor of the East India Company and ambassador to the court of Russia, Thomas Smythe, whose magnificent house was destroyed by fire in 1618; to early members of the Chartist movement, John Gast and George Julian Harney; and the Cleveleys, John Cleveley the Elder and his sons John and Robert, a family of marine artists who also worked as tradesmen in the Dockyard. Another artist born in Deptford is Henry Courtney Selous, who is known for &quot;The Opening of The Great Exhibition&quot;, painted in 1851.

Members of rock groups Squeeze and Dire Straits lived on the Crossfield Estate in Deptford in the late 1970s, along with Mark Perry, founder of the punk fanzine &quot;Sniffin Glue&quot; and punk rock band Alternative TV. The DJ and music journalist Danny Baker lived near the Crossfield Estate, where he was born and brought up. Steve Harley, frontman of the glamrock band Cockney Rebel, was born in Deptford.

Children&#x27;s author Robin Jarvis wrote two trilogies of books: &quot;The Deptford Mice&quot; (and a couple of spin off books called &quot;The Deptford Mouselets&quot; series) and &quot;The Deptford Histories&quot;, set in and around Deptford and featuring many of its landmarks.

Rapman (Andrew Onwubolu) is a British rapper and filmmaker who gained fame through YouTube storytelling series like &quot;Blue Story Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Shiro&#x27;s Story.&quot; His unique style blends rap with visual narratives, addressing London&#x27;s urban life and social issues. RapMan&#x27;s success led to a record deal with Island Records and Roc Nation. In 2019, he directed the critically acclaimed film &quot;Blue Story,&quot; which became the highest-grossing British urban film. His work continues to influence UK grime and hip-hop culture, spanning music, film, and television.

<text>Dulwich (; ) is an area in south London, England. The settlement is mostly in the London Borough of Southwark, with parts in the London Borough of Lambeth, and consists of Dulwich Village, East Dulwich, West Dulwich, and the Southwark half of Herne Hill (which is often referred to as the North Dulwich triangle). Dulwich lies in a valley between the neighbouring districts of Camberwell (to the north), Crystal Palace, Denmark Hill, Forest Hill, Peckham, Sydenham Hill, and Tulse Hill.

For the last four centuries Dulwich has been centred on the College of God&#x27;s Gift, also known as the &quot;Old College&quot;, which owned most of the land in the area today known as the Dulwich Estate. The College, founded with educational and charitable aims, established three large private schools in the 19th century (Dulwich College, Alleyn&#x27;s School and James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School). In recent decades four large state secondary schools have opened in the area (The Charter School East Dulwich, The Charter School North Dulwich, Kingsdale Foundation School and Harris Boys&#x27; Academy East Dulwich).

Dulwich formed part of the ancient parish of Camberwell in Surrey, which became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell within the County of London in 1889; in 1965, the borough was abolished and the area became part of the newly created London Borough of Southwark.

==History==
The first documented evidence of Dulwich is as a hamlet outside London in 967 AD, granted by King Edgar to one of his thanes. The name of Dulwich has been spelt in various ways since the Medieval period: Dylways, Dullag and most commonly Dilwysshe (from dile-wisc &#x27;meadow where the dill grew&#x27;). The land was granted in 1127 by King Henry I to Bermondsey Abbey who then owned the surrounding land. In 1333, the population of Dulwich was recorded as 100.

In 1538, Henry VIII sold the area to goldsmith Thomas Calton for £609. Calton&#x27;s grandson Sir Francis Calton, due to financial reasons, sold the Manor of Dulwich for £5,000 in 1605 to Elizabethan actor and entrepreneur Edward Alleyn. He vested his wealth in a charitable foundation, the College of God&#x27;s Gift, established in 1619. The charity&#x27;s modern successor, The Dulwich Estate, still owns in the area, including a number of private roads and a tollgate. As part of the foundation, Alleyn also constructed a school, the Christ&#x27;s Chapel (where Alleyn is buried) and alms houses in Dulwich (today the Dulwich Almshouse Charity). Alleyn&#x27;s original school building is no longer used for that purpose, instead now housing the Estate&#x27;s Governors.

In the 17th century, King Charles I of England visited Dulwich Woods on a regular basis to hunt. In 1738, a man named Samuel Bentyman was murdered in Dulwich Woods. On 5 August 1677 John Evelyn writes that he took the waters at Dulwich. The Dulwich waters were cried about in the streets of London as far back as 1678. In 1739, Mr. Cox, master of the Green Man, a tavern situated about a mile south of the village of Dulwich, sunk a well for his family. The water was found to be possessed of purgative qualities, and was for some time used medicinally. While the water was popular much custom was drawn to the adjoining tavern, and its proprietor flourished. The oak-lined formal avenue, known as Cox&#x27;s Walk, leading from the junction of Dulwich Common and Lordship Lane was cut soon after 1732 by Francis Cox to connect his establishment of the Green Man Tavern and Dulwich Wells with the more popular Sydenham Wells.

By 1815 the Green Man had become a school known as Dr. Glennie&#x27;s academy in Dulwich Grove, although it was demolished about ten years later. Among the pupils here there were a few who became well known, Lord Byron, General Le Marchant and Captain Barclay. Dr Glennie held Saturday evening concerts which attracted visitors from outside the family circle, such as the poet Thomas Campbell, then living in nearby Sydenham, and Robert Barker, inventor of the panorama. Following the closure of the school, the building reverted to its original use and was known as the Grove Tavern. The building has now been boarded up and neglected for many years by owners the Dulwich Estate. In 1803, Samuel Matthews – known as the &quot;Dulwich Hermit&quot; – was also murdered in Dulwich Woods; he was buried in Dulwich Old Cemetery. 1811–1814 saw the building of the Dulwich Picture Gallery.

The school founded by Alleyn expanded in 1842 into a small new building, designed by Sir Charles Barry who designed Westminster Palace, known as the Old Grammar School next to the Old College. In 1857, the foundation was restructured as part of a nationwide review of educational foundations; this resulted in a significant expansion of the school, which was split into an Upper School (later Dulwich College) which moved into new buildings designed by Charles Barry (junior) in 1870, and a Lower School (later Alleyn&#x27;s School) which moved to its present day site in Townley Road in 1887.

By 1901, the population had grown to 10,247 from a smaller population of 1,632 in 1851 due to the development of railway networks and a growth in housing for the middle and working classes. In the Second World War, Dulwich was hit by many V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. A possible explanation for this is that the British military when announcing V-1 and V-2 explosions deliberately gave map co-ordinates four miles north of the truth in an attempt to protect densely populated central London and focus the drops on the open spaces in the suburbs instead.

==Geography==
There are a number of recognised districts in Dulwich: 
*Dulwich Village which includes the traditional village centre
*West Dulwich which is a mainly residential area bordering West Norwood and Tulse Hill.
*Herne Hill (the Southwark half) which forms the North Dulwich Triangle, borders Brixton, Denmark Hill, Loughborough Junction and Tulse Hill.
*Sydenham Hill Wood and Dulwich Wood – The southern border includes Sydenham Hill station, St. Stephen&#x27;s Church and the mid-century housing estates of Great Brownings and Peckarmans Wood.
*East Dulwich, also a residential area, bordering Peckham

Dulwich Village contains the original shopping street and still contains nearly all of its original 18th and 19th century buildings. It remains very uncommercialised and is a conservation zone. The village borders on Dulwich Park, where the Dulwich Horse and Motor Show is held every year.

==Sport and leisure==
Dulwich is also home to Dulwich Hamlet F.C., founded in 1893 and competing in the Isthmian League today. They ground share with another Non-League football club Fisher F.C. at Champion Hill in East Dulwich. In recent years Sainsbury&#x27;s acquired the site, built Dulwich Hamlet a new ground, and developed one of the largest Sainsbury&#x27;s in the country.

The Old Alleynian Football Club is a local rugby union team originally for former pupils of Dulwich College, but is now open to all who wish to play. Dulwich Paragon cycling club are also based in the area. Alleyn Old Boys Club – former pupils of Alleyn&#x27;s School – is located on Burbage Road.

Dulwich is also home to Dulwich Harps Gaelic football team (Men and ladies teams) who train in Peckham Rye. The men&#x27;s team most recently winning Division 2 football league and Intermediate 2024 and Junior Championships. 

Dulwich has two running clubs, namely Dulwich Park RC and Dulwich Runners.

==Local landmarks==
Dulwich Park was opened in 1890. It was formerly farmland, part of the Court Farm, and now offers duck and rowing ponds, children&#x27;s play area, bowling green, tennis court, bridle path for horse-riding, and a café.

Dulwich Hospital in East Dulwich Grove was designed by Henry Jarvis and built on of land purchased in East Dulwich by the Guardians of the Poor of the Parish of St Saviour, Southwark, for the price of £50,000 in 1885. At the time of opening in 1887, it offered a 723-bed capacity. It was transformed from an infirmary into the Southwark Military Hospital during World War I, when it is estimated 14,000–15,000 wounded soldiers were treated at the hospital. After the Poor Law was abolished in 1930, the Southwark Union Infirmary was renamed Dulwich Hospital and the following year an operating theatre was built. In 1964, the hospital was aligned with King&#x27;s College Hospital on Denmark Hill. There is no casualty department at Dulwich at present. However, in 2015 it was announced that Dulwich Hospital was to be closed and replaced by a school.

There is a memorial fountain in Dulwich Village which is in remembrance to Dr George Webster, founder of the first British Medical Association (BMA), who worked in Dulwich from 1815 until his death in 1875.

Old Burial Ground, Dulwich Village, was created by Edward Alleyn as part of the foundation of his College of God&#x27;s Gift. The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, conducted the consecration on Sunday 1 September 1616. Guests included Edmund Bowyer, Thomas Grimes and William Gresham. Thirty five Dulwich victims of the plague were buried in unmarked graves in the ground. Old Bridget, queen of the Norwood Gypsies (who appeared in the writings of Samuel Pepys) was also buried here in 1768. The ground was declared &quot;full&quot; in 1858, however the family of Louisa Shroeder obtained special permission for her remains to be interred in 1868. The ground&#x27;s wrought iron gates and twelve tombs are Grade II listed.

The old Grammar School adjacent to the Old College and Almshouses at the junction of Burbage Road and Gallery Road was designed by Charles Barry (senior).

===Houses===
Belair House on the boundary between West Dulwich and Dulwich itself, is opposite West Dulwich railway station and was designed in 1785 for John Files. It remained a private house until 1938 when it came into the hands of Southwark Council. It fell into disrepair in the 1990s but was bought in 1998 and refurbished and turned into an upmarket restaurant. The house has a large park ground attached which is now public, including tennis courts and a children&#x27;s play area. This area used to be the fields for its farm. The lake is the only substantial stretch of the ancient River Effra remaining above ground.

Bell House (Dulwich) in College Road was designed in 1767 for Thomas Wright, a stationer and later Lord Mayor of the City of London. A large extension was added in the mid-19th century and it is accompanied by a lodge house. The house is Grade II listed. Its name comes from its Bell Tower situated on top of the original house and the bell was restored in the late 1990s. It became a Dulwich College boarding house in 1926 and only returned to private ownership in 1993. The house was bought in the summer of 2016 by an educational charity.

The Crown and Greyhound public house is in Dulwich Village. In the 19th century, two separate pubs stood in this area – the centre of Dulwich Village. The Crown was for the labourers of the area, while the Greyhound across the road, was for local gentry. The Greyhound was a coach stop on the London Piccadilly-Sittingbourne route. Charles Dickens was a frequent visitor to the village and used to drink at The Greyhound pub. The current pub known as &quot;The Dog&quot;, is a Grade II listed building. In the 1960s, it used to be known as the venue of the &quot;Dulwich Poets&quot;.

One of the area&#x27;s most famous residents and architects was Sir George Frederick Ellyatt (founder of the architecture practice, Ellyatt &amp; Porter). He was responsible for the design or influence of in excess of 25 homes in the area, each built in its own individual style. One of the most notable homes was Crossways, 1 Dulwich Village, which he built as his own home following being granted permission to do so in January 1927 at a cost of just over £2000 and with a ground rent of £22 10s per annum. Uniquely, Ellyatt sought and was granted permission to build in 9&quot; solid brick walls rather than 11&quot; cavity walls (as was usual convention) as long as he used cement mortar. The site was originally occupied by a Georgian built home, known locally as &quot;the Hall&quot; which had become partially derelict during World War I and was demolished in 1925. Crossways still exists in substantially the same manner and form as when it was originally built.

The Dulwich Wood and Sydenham Hill area contains mid-century housing estates designed by Austin Vernon and Partners for the Dulwich Estate. Examples include Peckarmans Wood and Great Brownings.

===Churches===
All Saints Church, West Dulwich (Church of England) alongside Rosendale Road is a Victorian Gothic building, originally intended to be the cathedral for south London. The church was built between 1888 and 1897 and designed by George Fellowes Prynne, a pupil of George Edmund Street. Although plans were scaled down it was still a huge building and is a Grade I listed building. Unfortunately it was gutted by a huge fire on 9 June 2000, the cause remains unknown. The building reopened in April 2006 after a three-year restoration project.

St Barnabas&#x27; Church (Church of England) lies on Calton Avenue at the edge of Dulwich Village. The old church was designed by W H Wood of Newcastle upon Tyne and consecrated in 1894. However the original church burnt down in an arson attack by &#x27;unknown persons&#x27; on Monday 7 December 1992. The &quot;Phoenix appeal&quot; raised money to build a new church and the replacement structure, designed by Larry Malcic with an all-glass spire, was opened in 1996.

Grace Church Dulwich is situated on Turney Road and was built in 1900. The church is currently a conservative evangelical Church of England church and meets on Sunday mornings at 10:30. The building is otherwise home to Rosendale School.

In the south, the spire of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church can be seen above the trees of Dulwich Wood, adjacent to Sydenham Hill railway station.

<text>Edgware () is a suburban town in northern Greater London. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex east of the ancient Watling Street in what is now the London Borough of Barnet but it is now informally considered to cover a wider area, including parts of the boroughs of Harrow and Brent. The district is located north-northwest of Charing Cross and has a generally suburban character. The urban-rural fringe includes some elevated woodland on a high gravel and sand ridge along the Hertfordshire border with Greater London.

Edgware is principally a shopping and residential area, identified in the London Plan as one of the capital&#x27;s 35 major centres, and one of the northern termini of the Northern line. It has a bus garage, a shopping centre called the Broadwalk Centre, a library, a community hospital—Edgware Community Hospital, and two streams—Edgware Brook and Deans Brook which merge and become known as the Silk Stream, itself a tributary of the River Brent.

As of 2011, the town had a population of 58,619.

==Toponymy==
Edgware is an Old English place-name first recorded in the 970s as Aegces wer, meaning Ecgi&#x27;s weir. Ecgi is a Saxon name and the weir relates to a pond where his people would catch fish. The name was subsequently applied to the ancient parish of Edgware.

A legal record of 1422 mentions &quot;Eggeswer&quot;, in Middlesex, which, being in Latin, may have been written deliberately using an older form of the spelling. By 1489, and the beginning of the Tudor period those writing the name added the &quot;d&quot; and it was Edggeware.

==Administration and boundaries==
===Administration===
Edgware was an ancient parish of in the county of Middlesex. 

Edgware parish was part of a grouping of parishes called Hendon Rural District (which didn&#x27;t include Hendon) from 1894. In 1931 Edgware moved from Hendon Rural District to the separate Hendon Urban District which did include Hendon.

The following year Hendon Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Hendon. In 1965 the Borough of Hendon merged with the Municipal Borough of Finchley, the urban districts of Barnet, East Barnet and Friern Barnet to become the new London Borough of Barnet.

===Boundaries and scope===
The Ancient parish formally defined the extent of Edgware for over 800 years, but the district is now sometimes perceived as covering a wider area.

====Ancient Parish====
Ancient parishes served one or more manors (occasionally very large manors would be divided into more than one parish). The boundaries of these underlying manors occasionally changed through subinfeudation (sub-division), and parish boundaries might sometimes change with that, but in 1180 the parish boundaries were frozen, so that sub-division of parishes was unusual after that time, usually only occurring in rapidly developing urban areas. 

The ancient parish served by St Margaret&#x27;s church was bounded to the west by Roman Watling Street with the parish of Little Stanmore beyond it. South of Deans Brook and Edgware Brook to the south and east was Hendon. &quot;Ecgi&#x27;s Weir&quot;, which gave the district its name is likely to have been built on one of these boundary brooks.

The parish appears to have inherited a much older boundary along these brooks, as these are described as part of the boundary of an estate in neighbouring Hendon. 

The parish&#x27;s northern boundary with the parish of Elstree, was also that of Middlesex and Hertfordshire. Middlesex&#x27;s northern boundary was, in this area, marked by a 20 kilometre hedge of great antiquity. When still unfragmented, the hedge extended from the River Colne (Middlesex&#x27;s western boundary) to Barnet Gate Wood. This boundary of Middlesex with Hertfordshire was inherited, in part, by the new Greater London in 1965. 

The area of Edgware was consistent and in the 1930s measured as .

====Electoral wards====
Both Barnet and Harrow have electoral wards named Edgware. The ward in Harrow was called &quot;South Stanmore&quot; until 2002. Electoral wards are regularly altered to ensure a consistent number of electors per ward across a local authority area.

====Postal area====
Edgware is part of the HA postcode area, named after nearby Harrow, of the London post town. More specifically Edgware is part of the HA8 postcode locality, associated with Edgware, but which covers a much wider area including Burnt Oak, The Hale, Canons Park, and parts of Queensbury. In this way HA8 take in part of the boroughs of Barnet, Harrow and Brent. Postcode areas are an operational convenience for the Royal Mail, and not intended to define districts.

Some eastern streets are in the NW postcode area.

==History==
===Origins and pre-industrial history===
The Romans made pottery at Brockley Hill, thought by some to be the site of Sulloniacis. 

Edgware does not appear in the Domesday survey of 1086. A manorial centre has, since at least 1216, been . 

Edgware Road follows the same line as the ancient Watling Street, an important Roman Road, and used in the medieval period by pilgrims. The Road was improved by the Edgware-Kilburn turnpike trust in 1711, and a number of the local inns functioned as a stop for coaches. By 1867 a railway line had been built between Edgware and Finsbury Park and a station was built. James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos built a stately home called Cannons in nearby Little Stanmore, around 1713 for £250,000 () and was by far the wealthiest resident in the vicinity at that time. 

By the 17th century Edgware had a small market selling cattle driven from other parts of England and fattened and sold locally. Local trades included butchers, tailors, colliers (charcoal sellers) and brewers. The market was held every week but petered out in 1790s.

Edgware was associated with the highwayman Dick Turpin. The infamous scene of his worst incident, which happened on 4 February 1735, was when five gang members, including Turpin, broke into a farmhouse owned by Joseph Lawrence, called Earlsbury Farm. Lawrence was at least 70 (so considered fairly old) and yet Turpin et al. beat him with their pistols and tortured him by setting him on a fire whilst naked, before announcing that they would amputate his legs. While this was going on, the leader of the gang took a servant girl upstairs and raped her.

===Early economic history===
Industry played a minor role in the economy of Edgware. There was a cattle and pleasure fair from 1760s to 1860s with horse racing between 1834 and 1855. Ribbon development along this part of the A5 road included development in the parish of Edgware to the east of the road, and Little Stanmore to the west of it.

Gravel pits were probably being worked by 1802 and certainly by 1834, partly at least by the labour of the able-bodied poor as a parish employment, and in 1963 gravel was still being extracted on the eastern side of the parish. In 1831 there were no persons engaged in manufacturing in the parish, and in fact there were no industries until in 1900 the firm of Chas. Wright Ltd., manufacturing engineers, moved from Clerkenwell: employed for the UK government in World War I and after this it struck 2,000,000 Mons or 1914 Stars and Victory Medals. Its largest production in World War II was for the metal parts of respirator filters: making 94½ million between 1937 and 1943. In 1963 the company was chiefly engaged in the manufacture of car registration plates. There were 70 workmen employed, together with an office staff of 30. The firm of A.E.W. Ltd., founded in 1923 and established in Edgware in 1927, at the start of the 1970s employed 50 people and manufactured laboratory and industrial electric ovens and furnaces.

Edgware had few residents for its size but saw some prosperous commerce: in 1870, for instance, there were six insurance agents in the village. The opening of the Great Northern Railway branch in 1867, however, seems to have had little effect on the expansion of the village, and plans to extend the railway met with strong local opposition. A Bill to establish a line from Watford to Edgware, brought before Parliament in 1896 and 1897, was opposed by residents, and it was said that the real harm of the railways was the opening up of building sites &#x27;which are quickly covered with architectural atrocities&#x27;. In this time the parish had begun to display a tendency to split into an opulent north and a workaday south, separated by an agricultural buffer zone. By 1896 several large houses had been built in the Elstree area or along the Elstree–Barnet road, while the old village gained the post office, the infants&#x27; school, the station, and the Railway Hotel. The southern part of the parish was unable to repel the tide of suburban development, but the threatened distinction was to a large extent averted by the quality of buildings between the two world wars.

===Suburban transformation===
The first (non-tube connected) railway accompanied a brief decline in population. By the mid 19th century the area was almost entirely for the purpose of hay production. In 1939 the overground railway passenger service ceased to run, and goods traffic ceased by 1964. A tram service began in 1904. In 1921 the population was 1,516. Although much suburban development was encouraged by the opening of the tube station in 1924, the area was already attracting developers like George Cross to the area by 1919. The conurbation increased as far north as the Edgware Way. In 1932 the parish became a part of Hendon Urban District. The shopping district around Station Road developed to include the Ritz Cinema, which opened in May 1932. Following several name changes the cinema was eventually demolished in 2001 and replaced by a large gym, apartments and a Caffè Nero. The Edgware Town F.C. was founded in 1939 after a predecessor team in 1915.

A general hospital on Burnt Oak Broadway dates back to an that was added at a workhouse from the Hendon Board of Guardians in 1865, with an all new site adjacent to it built and opened with 175 beds in December 1927 as Redhill Hospital. It was extended greatly by Middlesex County Council in the late 1930s. It became part of the National Health Service in 1948 and was renamed Edgware General Hospital.

Post-war development has been restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt, sparing urban sprawl into the Scratch Wood and Deacons Hill areas apart from the M1 motorway. By this time the population was more than 17,000. In 1990, the Mall Shopping Centre, originally called the Broadwalk Shopping Centre, replaced the former Edgware Town station pulled down in 1961.

Following a review in 1994, Edgware General Hospital was controversially closed by the Conservative government of John Major in April 1997 despite public opposition. After the Labour Party election victory the closure was upheld, leading to further outcry from the public. Eventually a review and lengthy consultations took place with local campaigners and authorities, which resulted in the building of a community hospital. Some of the General Hospital site was demolished and Edgware Community Hospital, which cost £38 million, opened in its place in February 2005.

Edgware was identified in 2008 as a major centre for preferred development in the London Plan.

In the mid-2010s, many new apartments have been built on Green Lane.

==Geography==
Edgware town centre lies about above sea level. Much of Edgware is steep, particularly around Edgwarebury Park (a Site of Nature Conservation Interest) and the Broadfields Estate.

The Edgwarebury Brook (not to be confused with the &quot;Edgware Brook&quot;), is a tributary of Deans Brook. 
The Deans Brook and &quot;Edgware Brook&quot;, which form the historic southern boundary of the area, merge and take the name Silk Stream in the vicinity of Edgware Hospital (known as Redhill Hospital till 1948). The Silk Stream is a tributary of the River Brent, which it meets at Brent Reservoir. 

Open spaces in the area include Edgwarebury Park and Stoneyfields Park. 

Major roads in the vicinity include the A5, the A41 road (Watford Bypass) and the M1 motorway. The A5 Road (originally the Roman Watling Street) runs from central London by way of Edgware and onto Wroxeter in Shropshire. The Road is known as the &quot;High Street&quot;, &quot;Stone Grove&quot; and &quot;Brockley Hill&quot; as it runs along the Edgware/Little Stanmore parish boundary; immediately south of that boundary it is known as &quot;Burnt Oak Broadway&quot;. Further south it is known as Edgware Road, meaning &quot;the road to Edgware&quot;.

==Demography and religion==
Until the 20th century there were no major rises in the population of Edgware. In the manor of Edgware in 1277 there were eight free tenants (excluding the Grand Priory of Clerkenwell) and 52 customary tenants (assumed to all be men); the survey from which these figures are taken, however, includes lands appurtenant to the manor lying in Kingsbury. In 1425–26 the manor of Edgware had three free and 29 customary tenants in the parish, and in 1525–26 the numbers were two or three free and 26 customary tenants. In 1547 there were 120 (adult or teenage) communicants in the parish. In 1597 there were between 60 and 70 houses in the parish, and 44 more in the village of Edgware but on the west side of Watling Street and therefore in the parish of Little Stanmore. In 1599 there were six free and 25 customary tenants of the manor within Edgware. In 1642 in the Civil War the protestation oath of 1641 was taken by 103 adult males. In 1664 there were 73 houses in the parish, but the hearth tax of 1672 gives only 66. During the 18th century the average numbers both of baptisms and burials declined gently but steadily; in the period 1717–26 the average number of baptisms was between 15 and 16 a year and the average number of burials 20, but by 1801–10 the figures were 11 and 9, respectively. There were said to be 69 houses in the village in 1766 and 76 houses in 1792. At the first census in 1801 the population was 412. Throughout the 19th century numbers rose slowly, except for the years between 1851 and 1871; the censuses of 1861 and 1871 show successive declines of 7 percent, attributed in 1871 to migration and to the absence of direct trains to London.

Ten years later the losses had been more than made good, and in 1901 the figure of 868 had been reached. By 1921 the population had grown to 1,516, but the great infilling of the southern part of Edgware after 1924 caused the most spectacular increase. In 1931 the population was 5,352; this had increased to 17,513 by 1951 and to 20,127 by 1961.

As well as Christian and subsequent settling of other religious groups, Edgware&#x27;s development coincided with that of its Jewish community, currently forming the largest single religious group. In the 2001 Census, 36% of Edgware residents give their religion as Jewish, 28% Christian, 9% Hindu and 5% Muslim. The Jewish community in Edgware has constructed its own Eruv.

Edgware has a strong Jewish character, and also has significant Hindu and Muslim minorities, mostly of Indian origin.

According to the 2011 census:

*Edgware ward of Barnet was 60% white (47% British, 12% Other White, 1% Irish). 13% was Indian and 7% Black African. 33% of the population was Jewish, 28% Christian and 11% Muslim. The most spoken foreign language is Gujarati.
*Hale ward of Barnet (east from the centre) was 59% white (45% British, 12% Other, 2% Irish) and 10% Indian. 39% was Christian and 19% Jewish. The most spoken foreign language is Gujarati followed by Persian and Romanian.

==Economy==

Argonaut Games once had its head office in Edgware. They were in Argonaut House, now known as Cavendish House. The computer game &quot;Worms&quot; was designed there and contracts came from Nintendo.

Green Shield Stamps was also headquartered in Edgware until its closure in 1991. It occupied Premier House who commenced its development in 2014 into 121 residential flats, now subject to dispute by current residents over the Grenfell type of cladding used in the development. Premier House residential is known as Premier Place.

<text>Aelia Eudocia Augusta (; ; 460 AD), also called Saint Eudocia, was an Eastern Roman empress by marriage to Emperor Theodosius II (). Daughter of an Athenian philosopher, she was also a poet, whose works include &quot;Homerocentones&quot;, or Homeric retellings of Biblical stories. After an estrangement with Theodosius, she permanently settled in Jerusalem, where she supported the local population.

==Early life==

Aelia Eudocia was born circa 400 in Athens. The 7th century &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; describes her as Greek. She was said to be of pagan background, and according to her contemporary Socrates Scholasticus, she was baptized shortly before her marriage to Theodosius. Her father, an Athenian sophist named Leontius, taught rhetoric at the Academy of Athens, where people from all over the Mediterranean came to either teach or learn. Eudocia&#x27;s first name was Athenais, a pagan name chosen by her parents in honour of the city&#x27;s protector, the goddess Pallas Athena, or as her parents&#x27; devotion to Attic culture. Her father was rich and had a magnificent house on the Acropolis with a large courtyard in which young Athenais frequently played as a child.

When Athenais was 12 years old, her mother died and she became her father&#x27;s comfort, taking on the responsibilities of household chores, raising her siblings and tending to her father. She had two brothers, Gessius and Valerius, who would later receive honours at court from their sister and brother-in-law. In return for her household activities, her father spent time giving her a thorough training in rhetoric, literature and philosophy. He taught her the Socratic virtue of knowledge of moderation, and predicted that she would have a great destiny. She had a gift for memorization, and easily learned the poetry of Homer and Pindar, which her father would recite to her. Both as a teacher and a role model, he had a great impact on her, prepared her for her destiny and influenced the literary work she created after she became Empress.

According to John Malalas, who wrote in the 6th century, when her father died, he left all his property to her brothers, with only 100 coins reserved for her in his will, saying that &quot;[s]ufficient for her is her destiny, which will be the greatest of any woman.&quot; Athenais had been her father&#x27;s confidante and had expected more than this meager 100-coin inheritance. She begged her brothers, to give her an equal share of their father&#x27;s property, but they refused. Shortly after her father&#x27;s death, Athenais went to live with her aunt, who advised her to go to Constantinople and &quot;ask for justice from the Emperor&quot;, confident she would receive her fair share of her father&#x27;s wealth.

Historian Kenneth Holum further introduced the suggestion that her father, Leontius, was a native of Antioch rather than Athens, drawing from the &quot;traditional link&quot; between the two cities and their philosophers. Holum suggests that Eudocia may have been named after the great city of Athens, but she would have been born in Antioch. The argument has been doubted by some scholars, because the building activity of Eudocia in the 420s focused on Athens rather than Antioch.

==Life as an empress==

===Marriage===

Legend has it that when Theodosius (b. 401) was 20 years old, he wanted to get married. He talked to his sister Pulcheria, who began to search for a maiden fit for her brother, that was of either &quot;patrician or imperial blood.&quot; His longtime childhood friend, Paulinus, also helped Theodosius in his search. The Emperor&#x27;s search began at the same time that Athenais had arrived in Constantinople. Pulcheria had heard about this young woman, who had only 100 coins to her name, and when she met her, she was &quot;astonished at her beauty and at the intelligence and sophistication with which she presented her grievance.&quot; Athenais&#x27;s aunts assured Pulcheria that she was a virgin and was well educated. Pulcheria reported back to her brother that she had &quot;found a young girl, a Greek maid, very beautiful, pure and dainty, eloquent as well, the daughter of a philosopher&quot;, and young Theodosius, who was full of desire, fell in love instantly.

Athenais had been raised pagan, and upon her marriage to Theodosius II converted to Christianity and was renamed Eudocia. They were married on 7 June 421, and there were &quot;reports that Theodosius celebrated his wedding with chariot races in the hippodrome&quot;. Her brothers, who had rejected her after their father&#x27;s death, fled since they were fearful of the punishment they thought they were going to receive when they learned that she became empress. Eudocia instead called them to Constantinople, and Theodosius rewarded them. The emperor made Gessius praetorian prefect of Illyricum and made Valerius &quot;magister officiorum&quot;. Both Gessius and Valerius were rewarded because Eudocia believed that their mistreatment of her was part of her destiny. Theodosius also honoured his best friend, Paulinus, with the title of &quot;magister officiorum&quot;, for he had helped find his wife.

This rags-to-riches story, though it claims to be authentic and is accepted among historians, leads one to believe that the tale may have been twisted due to the detail of how the romance was portrayed. The earliest version of this story appeared more than a century after Eudocia&#x27;s death in the &quot;World Chronicle&quot; of John Malalas, &quot;an author who did not always distinguish between authentic history and a popular memory of events infused with folk-tale motifs&quot;. The facts are that she was the daughter of Leontius and she did originally have the name Athenais, according to the contemporary historians Socrates of Constantinople, and Priscus of Panion; however, they leave out any mention of Pulcheria&#x27;s role in playing match-maker for her brother. The historians Sozomen and Theodoret did not include Eudocia in their respective historical works, perhaps because they wrote after 443 when Eudocia had fallen into disgrace.

Eudocia also built the original Church of St. Polyeuctus in Constantinople, which her great-granddaughter Anicia Juliana greatly expanded and furnished in the 6th century.

===Children===
Eudocia had two, or possibly three, children with Theodosius II. Licinia Eudoxia, born in 422, was the oldest. Licinia Eudoxia had been betrothed since her birth to her cousin, the Western Roman emperor Valentinian III, whom she married on 29 October 437. The second child, Flaccilla, died in 431. Arcadius, if he existed, may have been the only son and died in infancy. Only a year after she gave birth to her first child, Eudocia was proclaimed Augusta by her husband on 2 January 423.

Eudocia also was the guardian for the Georgian prince Nabarnugios who had been sent as a hostage to the Byzantine court. Nabarnugious, who would become known as Peter the Iberian, would later decide to became an ascetic and flee to Jerusalem with his friend John the Eunuch.

===Pilgrimage to Jerusalem (438–439)===

After being named &quot;Augusta&quot;, her relationship to her sister-in-law, Pulcheria, worsened. Eudocia was jealous over the amount of power Pulcheria had within the court, while Pulcheria was jealous of the power Eudocia could claim from her. Their relationship created a &quot;pious atmosphere&quot; in the imperial court, and probably explains why Eudocia travelled to the Holy Land in 438. Eudocia went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 438, bringing back with her holy relics to prove her faith. Her relationship with her husband had deteriorated, and with much pleading from Melania the Younger, a wealthy widow from Palestine and good friend of Eudocia, Theodosius allowed her to go.

===Blending Christianity with classical culture===
While on her pilgrimage to Jerusalem in spring of 438, Eudocia stopped in Antioch, and during her stay she addressed the senate of that city in Hellenic style (i.e., an encomium cast in Homeric hexameters) and distributed funds for the repair of its buildings. She was very conscious of her Greek heritage, as demonstrated in her famous address to the citizens of Antioch where she quoted a famous line by Homer: &quot;ὑμετέρης γενεής τε καὶ αἵματος εὔχομαι εἶναι&quot; (&quot;Of your proud line and blood I claim to be&quot;).c These last words of Eudocia&#x27;s oration brought loud acclaim from the listeners, which resulted in the citizens of Antioch celebrating the Empress Eudocia&#x27;s Christian Hellenism and commemorating her by erecting a golden statue of her in the curia and a bronze statue in the museum. 

Eudocia convinced her husband to &quot;extend the walls of Antioch to take in a large suburb&quot;. Furthermore, she also influenced state policy towards pagans and Jews under her husband&#x27;s reign, and used the powerful influence she had to protect them from persecution. Eudocia also advocated for &quot;reorganization and expansion&quot; of education in Constantinople. Eudocia had been raised and educated in traditional and classical sophist education from Athens, but her goal was to blend classical pagan education with Christianity. This was her way of using her power as empress to honour teachers and education, something that was very important to her in her life.

===Banishment===
On her arrival from Jerusalem, her position was allegedly undermined by the jealousy of Pulcheria and the suspicion of an affair with Paulinus, the master of the offices.

Around 443, Eudocia left the palace for reasons that cannot be fully ascertained. One rumor has it that Eudocia was banished from the court towards the latter part of her life for adultery. Theodosius suspected that she was having an affair with his long-time childhood friend and court advisor, Paulinus. According to Malalas&#x27;s account of this story, Theodosius II had given Eudocia a very large Phrygian apple as a gift. One day Paulinus had shown the emperor the same apple, not knowing that the emperor had given it to Eudocia as a gift. Theodosius recognized the apple and confronted Eudocia who had sworn she had eaten it. Eudocia&#x27;s denials made the emperor believe that she had fallen in love with Paulinus and was having an affair, and had given his best friend the same apple he had given to her as a symbol of his love. Theodosius had Paulinus executed and Eudocia, embarrassed, decided to leave the court in 443.

On the other hand, Marcellinus&#x27; version suggests intrigues of Theodosius and Eudocia against each other: on Theodosius&#x27; orders, comes domesticorum Saturninus killed two allies of the empress, and in revenge, she went on to have Saturninus assassinated. Theodosius subsequently deprived Eudocia of her royal attendants, prompting her to leave the palace. Whatever the cause of her departure may be, she still retained her wealth and the title &quot;Augusta&quot;.

===In Jerusalem (443–460)===
Eudocia returned to Jerusalem in circa 443, where she lived for the last part of her life. In Jerusalem she focused on her writing. She nevertheless retained great influence. She also rekindled her relation with her former ward Peter the Iberian as well as with Melania the Younger, a famous ascetic. Although involved in the revolt of the Syriac Monophysites (453), she was ultimately reconciled to Pulcheria and readmitted into the Eastern Orthodox Church. She died an Orthodox Christian in Jerusalem on 20 October 460, having devoted her last years to literature. She was buried in Jerusalem in the Church of Saint Stephen, one of the churches she had herself built in Jerusalem; modern St. Stephen&#x27;s Basilica now stands at the site. The empress never returned to the imperial court in Constantinople, but &quot;she maintained her imperial dignity and engaged in substantial euergetistic programs.&quot;

==Literary work==

Soon after her accession as an empress, Eudocia wrote a hexameter poem eulogizing the Roman performance in the Persian wars of 421–22. The work is now lost. While Eudocia could have written a lot of literature after leaving the court, only some of her work survived. Eudocia &quot;wrote in hexameters, which is the verse of epic poetry, on Christian themes&quot;. She wrote a poem entitled The &quot;Martyrdom of St. Cyprian&quot; in three books, of which 900 lines survived, and an inscription of a poem on the baths at Hamat Gader. Her most studied piece of literature is her Homeric cento, which has been analyzed recently by a few modern scholars, such as Mark Usher and Brian Sowers. According to Usher, Eudocia is an understudied poet and has been neglected due to &quot;lack of complete and authoritative text&quot;.

===Martyrdom of St. Cyprian===
There are three books (or volumes) to this epic poem, which tells the story of how &quot;Justa, the Christian virgin, defeated the magician Cyprian through her faith in God. Cyprian had been hired by Aglaidas to force Justa to love him. It ends with the conversion of Cyprian, his swift rise to the rank of Bishop, and Justa becoming a deaconess, with the new name, Justina.&quot; She later became known as Justina of Antioch. This story is all fiction, although the parallels between Eudocia&#x27;s character Justa and Eudocia herself are interesting, as both of them converted to Christianity and changed their names upon succeeding to power. Although some of the text has been lost, most of it has been paraphrased by Photius. The poem is very long despite not all of it surviving the centuries, and can be found in &quot;Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome&quot; (2004) edited by Michael Ian Plant. Homer (particularly the Odyssey) is a pivotal linguistic and thematic model for the poem.

===The Hamat Gader poem===
The poem inscribed on the baths at Hamat Gader was very short, and can be included here, as evidence of her hexameter writing style. The poem was inscribed so visitors could read it as they went into the pool.

The line &quot;Of the Empress Eudocia&quot; flanked by two crosses is set above the poem. This title line was added after the carving of the main inscription, making room for some doubt whether the poem was indeed authored by Eudocia. Clibanus is the name given to the source of the hot water. After praising his qualities and those of his many springs (&quot;the thousandfold swell&quot;), the poem enumerates &quot;four-fold four&quot;, thus sixteen different parts of the bath complex, fourteen of which bear a name; these names include Hygieia (the pagan goddess of health), a whole range of pagan personal names, &quot;holy Elijah&quot; referring to the prophet, and two refer to Christians – a nun and a patriarch.

===Homeric centos===
The Homeric centos that Eudocia composed are her most popular poems, as well as those most analyzed by modern scholars, because Homer was a popular choice on which to write a cento. Eudocia&#x27;s centos are the longest Homeric centos, and consist of 2,344 lines. These centos are a clear representation of who Eudocia was, and what she believed in—an epic poem combining her Athenian classical educational background, but adding stories from the book of Genesis and the New Testament stories of the life of Jesus Christ. The most extensive surviving portion of Eudocia&#x27;s work is 2354 lines about Adam and Eve, based upon an incomplete poem by a man named Patricius.

Mark Usher analyzed this poem as a way to understand why Eudocia chose to use Homeric themes as a means to express her biblical interpretations. According to Usher, Eudocia needed to convey human experience relating to the Bible. She used themes from the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; because &quot;they contained all Eudocia needed to tell the Gospel story. Whenever and wherever Eudocia needed to express greatness, pain, truthfulness, deceit, beauty, suffering, mourning, recognition, understanding, fear, or astonishment, there was an apt Homeric line or passage ready in her memory to be recalled.&quot; Eudocia&#x27;s Homeric poetry is essential to understanding her as a Christian woman in the Eastern Roman Empire, and understanding her role as empress. Her classical educational background is clearly seen in her poetry, which captures her literary talent, as exemplified by her potential use of acrostics. She made a point to connect her background love for studying classical Greek literature to her Christian beliefs.

==Legacy==
Eudocia is regarded as a saint. Her feast day is 13 August.

She is a prominent Greek historical figure in understanding the rise of Christianity during the beginning of the Byzantine Empire. Eudocia lived in a world where Greek paganism and Christianity existed side by side. According to Brian Sowers, Eudocia&#x27;s work (including the Homeric centos and an epic poem on the martyrdom of St. Cyprian) has been mostly ignored by modern scholars, but her poetry and literary work are an example of how her Christian faith and paganism were intertwined, exemplifying a legacy that the Roman Empire left behind on the Christian world.

The plot of Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s opera &quot;Atenaide&quot; is based on the courtship and marriage of Eudocia and Theodosius.
Eudocia is a featured figure on Judy Chicago&#x27;s installation piece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, being represented as one of the 999 names on the &quot;Heritage Floor,&quot; associated with the place setting for Theodora (wife of Justinian I)&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Royal Marines, also known as the Royal Marines Commandos, and officially as the Corps of Royal Marines, are the United Kingdom&#x27;s amphibious special operations capable commando force, one of the five fighting arms of the Royal Navy, and provide a company strength unit to the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG). The Royal Marines trace their origins back to the formation of the &quot;Duke of York and Albany&#x27;s maritime regiment of Foot&quot; on 28 October 1664, and the first Royal Marines Commando unit was formed at Deal in Kent on 14 February 1942 and designated &quot;The Royal Marine Commando&quot;.

The Royal Marines have seen action across many conflicts but do not have battle honours as such, but rather the &quot;Great Globe itself&quot; was chosen in 1827 by King George IV in their place to recognise the Marines&#x27; service and successes in multiple engagements in every quarter of the world. The Corps has close ties with allied marine forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps ().

==History==
=== Origins ===

The Royal Marines trace their origins back to 28 October 1664 when the Duke of York and Albany&#x27;s Maritime Regiment of Foot was formed at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company.

The &#x27;first official&#x27; unit of English naval infantry, originally called the Duke of York and Albany&#x27;s Maritime Regiment of Foot and soon becoming known as the Admiral&#x27;s Regiment, was formed on 28 October 1664, with an initial strength of 1,200 infantrymen recruited from the Trained Bands of London as part of the mobilisation for the Second Anglo-Dutch War. James (later King James VII &amp; II), the Duke of York and Albany, Lord High Admiral and brother of King Charles II, was Captain-General of the Artillery Company, now the Honourable Artillery Company, the unit that trained the Trained Bands.

It was the fifth European Marine unit formed, being preceded by the Spain&#x27;s Infantería de Marina (1537), the &quot;Fanti da Mar&quot; of the Republic of Venice (1550), the Portuguese Marine Corps (1610) and France&#x27;s Troupes de marine (1622). It consisted of six 200-man companies and was initially commanded by Colonel Sir William Killigrew with Sir Charles Lyttleton as lieutenant-colonel. Killigrew had commanded an English regiment in Dutch service, and many of the regiment&#x27;s initial complement of officers had served there as well.

The Holland Regiment (later The Buffs) was also raised to serve at sea and both of these &quot;Naval&quot; regiments were paid for by the Treasurer of the Navy by Order of Council of 11 July 1665. John Churchill, later the 1st Duke of Marlborough, was a famous member of this regiment. A Company of Foot Guards served as Marines to augment the Marines of the Admiral&#x27;s Regiment during the key sea battle the Battle of Solebay in 1672. The regiment was disbanded in 1689 shortly after James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution.

Two marine regiments of the army were raised in 1690. They were the Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s and Torrington&#x27;s, later Lord Berkeley&#x27;s. These two regiments participated in an opposed landing during the Williamite War in Ireland at Cork, Ireland on 21 September 1690 under the command of John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough.

In 1699 the marine regiments were disbanded, but they were raised again from 1702 to 1713 to fight in the War of the Spanish Succession; their most notable contribution being the capture of Gibraltar in 1704.

===Early British Empire===
On 5 April 1755, His Majesty&#x27;s Marine Forces, fifty Companies in three Divisions, headquartered at Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, were formed by Order of Council under Admiralty control. Initially Marine field officer ranks were honorary sinecure positions awarded to senior Royal Navy officers. This meant that the furthest a Marine officer could advance was to lieutenant colonel. It was not until 1771 that the first Marine was promoted to colonel. This attitude persisted well into the 1800s. During the rest of the 18th century, they served in numerous landings all over the world, the most famous being the landing at Belle Île on the Brittany coast in 1761. They also served in the American War of Independence, notably in the Battle of Bunker Hill led by Major John Pitcairn.
In 1788 a detachment of four companies of marines, under Major Robert Ross, accompanied the First Fleet to protect a new colony at Botany Bay (New South Wales). Due to an error the Fleet left Portsmouth without its main supply of ammunition, and were not resupplied until the Fleet docked in Rio de Janeiro midway through the voyage. Some scholars contend that the Marines deliberately spread smallpox among Australia&#x27;s Indigenous population in order to protect the settlement, but this incident does not appear in contemporaneous Marine or government records and most researchers associate the disease outbreak with other causes.
In 1802, largely at the instigation of Admiral the Earl St Vincent, they were titled the Royal Marines by King George III. The Royal Marines Artillery (RMA) was formed as a separate unit in 1804 to man the artillery in bomb ketches. These had been manned by the Army&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Artillery, but a lawsuit by a Royal Artillery officer resulted in a court decision that Army officers were not subject to Naval orders. As RMA uniforms were the blue of the Royal Regiment of Artillery they were nicknamed the &quot;Blue Marines&quot; and the infantry element, who wore the red uniforms of the British infantry, became known as the &quot;Red Marines&quot;, often given the semi-derogatory nickname &quot;Lobsters&quot; by sailors. A fourth division of the Royal Marines, headquartered at Woolwich, was formed in 1805.

During the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Marines participated in every notable naval battle on board the Royal Navy&#x27;s ships and also took part in multiple amphibious actions. Marines had a dual function aboard ships of the Royal Navy in this period; routinely, they ensured the security of the ship&#x27;s officers and supported their maintenance of discipline in the ship&#x27;s crew, and in battle, they engaged the enemy&#x27;s crews, whether firing from positions on their own ship, or fighting in boarding actions. In the Caribbean theatre volunteers from freed French slaves on Marie-Galante were used to form Sir Alexander Cochrane&#x27;s first Corps of Colonial Marines. These men bolstered the ranks, helping the British to hold the island until reinforcements arrived. This practice was repeated during the War of 1812, where escaped American slaves were formed into Cochrane&#x27;s second Corps of Colonial Marines. These men were commanded by Royal Marines officers and fought alongside their regular Royal Marines counterparts at the Battle of Bladensburg. Throughout the war Royal Marines units raided up and down the east coast of America including up the Penobscot River and in the Chesapeake Bay. They fought in the Battle of New Orleans and later helped capture Fort Bowyer in Mobile Bay in what was the last action of the war.

In 1855 the infantry forces were renamed the Royal Marines Light Infantry (RMLI). During the Crimean War in 1854 and 1855, three Royal Marines earned the Victoria Cross, two in the Crimea and one in the Baltic. In 1862 the name was slightly altered to Royal Marine Light Infantry. The Royal Navy did not fight any other ships after 1850 and became interested in landings by Naval Brigades. In these Naval Brigades, the function of the Royal Marines was to land first and act as skirmishers ahead of the sailor infantry and artillery. This skirmishing was the traditional function of light infantry. For most of their history, British Marines had been organised as fusiliers. In the rest of the 19th Century the Royal Marines served in many landings especially in the First and Second Opium Wars (1839–1842 and 1856–1860) against the Chinese. These were all successful except for the landing at the Mouth of the Peiho in 1859, where Admiral Sir James Hope ordered a landing across extensive mud flats.

The Royal Marines also played a prominent role in the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900), where a Royal Marine earned a Victoria Cross.

===Status and roles===
Through much of the 18th and 19th centuries Marine officers had a lower standing status than their counterparts in the Royal Navy. A short-lived
effort was made in 1907, through the common entry or &quot;Selborne scheme&quot;, to reduce the professional differences between RN and RM officers through a system of common entry that provided for an initial period of shared training.

By the early twentieth century the Royal Marines had achieved a high professional status, although there was a serious shortage of junior officers. Numbering about 15,000 during the Edwardian era, enlistment for other ranks was for at least 12 years, with entitlement to a pension after 21 years of service. After basic training new recruits were assigned to one of three land-based divisions and from there to warships as vacancies arose. From 1908 onwards one gun turret on each battleship was manned by RMA gunners. The RMLI continued their traditional role of providing landing parties and shore-based detachments. Specialist positions on board ship, such as postmen, barbers, lamp trimmers and butchers, were reserved for Royal Marines. After 1903 the Royal Marines provided bands for service on board battleships and other large vessels.

===World wars===
====First World War====
During the First World War, in addition to their usual stations aboard ship, Royal Marines were part of the Royal Naval Division which landed in Belgium in 1914 to help defend Antwerp and later took part in the amphibious landing at Gallipoli in 1915. It also served on the Western Front. The Division&#x27;s first two commanders were Royal Marine Artillery Generals. Other Royal Marines acted as landing parties in the Naval campaign against the Turkish fortifications in the Dardanelles before the Gallipoli landing. They were sent ashore to assess damage to Turkish fortifications after bombardment by British and French ships and, if necessary, to complete their destruction. The Royal Marines were the last to leave Gallipoli, replacing both British and French troops in a neatly planned and executed withdrawal from the beaches.

The Royal Marines also took part in the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. Five Royal Marines earned the Victoria Cross in the First World War, two at Zeebrugge, one at Gallipoli, one at Jutland and one on the Western Front.

====Between the wars====
After the war Royal Marines took part in the allied intervention in Russia. In 1919, the 6th Battalion RMLI mutinied and was disbanded at Murmansk. The Royal Marine Artillery (RMA) and Royal Marine Light Infantry (RMLI) were amalgamated on 22 June 1923. Post-war demobilisation had seen the Royal Marines reduced from 55,000 (1918) to 15,000 in 1922 and there was Treasury pressure for a further reduction to 6,000 or even the entire disbandment of the Corps. As a compromise an establishment of 9,500 was settled upon but this meant that two separate branches could no longer be maintained. The abandonment of the Marine&#x27;s artillery role meant that the Corps would subsequently have to rely on Royal Artillery support when ashore, that the title of Royal Marines would apply to the entire Corps and that only a few specialists would now receive gunnery training. As a form of consolation the dark blue and red uniform of the Royal Marine Artillery now became the full dress of the entire Corps. Royal Marine officers and SNCO&#x27;s however continue to wear the historic scarlet in mess dress to the present day. The ranks of private, used by the RMLI, and gunner, used by the RMA, were abolished and replaced by the rank of Marine.

====Second World War====

During the Second World War, a small party of Royal Marines were first ashore at Namsos in April 1940, seizing the approaches to the Norwegian town preparatory to a landing by the British Army two days later. The Royal Marines formed the Royal Marine Division as an amphibiously trained division, parts of which served at Dakar and in the capture of Madagascar. After the assault on the French naval base at Antsirane in Madagascar was held up, fifty Sea Service Royal Marines from commanded by Captain Martin Price were landed on the quay of the base by the destroyer after it ran the gauntlet of French shore batteries defending Diego Suarez Bay. They then captured two of the batteries, which led to a quick surrender by the French.

In addition the Royal Marines formed Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisations (MNBDOs) similar to the United States Marine Corps Defense Battalions. One of these took part in the defence of Crete. Royal Marines also served in Malaya and in Singapore, where due to losses they were joined with remnants of the 2nd Battalion of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at Tyersall Park to form the &quot;Plymouth Argylls&quot;. The Royal Marines formed one Commando (A Commando) which served at Dieppe. One month after Dieppe, most of the 11th Royal Marine Battalion was killed or captured in an ill staged amphibious landing at Tobruk in Operation Agreement. Again, the Marines were involved with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, this time the 1st Battalion. In 1942 the Infantry Battalions of the Royal Marine Division were re-organised as Commandos, joining the British Army Commandos. The Division command structure became a Special Service Brigade command. The support troops became landing craft crew and saw extensive action on D-Day in June 1944.

A total of four Special Service Brigades (redesignated Commando brigades in December 1944 as the &quot;SS&quot; abbreviation was unpopular) were raised during the war, and Royal Marines were represented in all of them. A total of nine RM Commandos were raised during the war, numbered from 40 to 48. These were distributed as follows:

* 1 Commando Brigade 
**45 (RM) Commando
*2 Commando Brigade
** 40 (RM) Commando 
** 43 (RM) Commando
*3 Commando Brigade 
**42 (RM) Commando
** 44 (RM) Commando 
*4 Commando Brigade (entirely Royal Marine after March 1944)
**41 (RM) Commando
**46 (RM) Commando
**47 (RM) Commando
**48 (RM) Commando

1 Commando Brigade took part in first in the Tunisia Campaign and then assaults on Sicily and Normandy, campaigns in the Rhineland and crossing the Rhine. 2 Commando Brigade was involved in the Salerno landings, Anzio, Comacchio, and operations in the Argenta Gap. 3 Commando Brigade served in Sicily and Burma. 4 Commando Brigade served in the Battle of Normandy and in the Battle of the Scheldt on the island of Walcheren during the clearing of Antwerp.

In January 1945, two further RM Brigades were formed, 116th Brigade and 117th Brigade. Both were conventional Infantry, rather than in the Commando role. 116th Brigade saw some action in the Netherlands, but 117th Brigade was hardly used operationally. In addition one Landing Craft Assault (LCA) unit was stationed in Australia late in the war as a training unit. In 1946 the Army Commandos were disbanded, leaving the Royal Marines to continue the Commando role (with supporting Army elements). A number of Royal Marines served as pilots during the Second World War. It was a Royal Marines officer who led the attack by a formation of Blackburn Skuas that sank the Königsberg. Eighteen Royal Marines commanded Fleet Air Arm squadrons during the course of the war, and with the formation of the British Pacific Fleet were well represented in the final drive on Japan. Captains and Majors generally commanded squadrons, whilst in one case Lt Colonel R.C. Hay on HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was Air Group Co-ordinator from HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; of the entire British Pacific Fleet.

Throughout the war Royal Marines continued in their traditional role of providing ships detachments and manning a proportion of the guns on Cruisers and Capital Ships. They also provided the crew for the UK&#x27;s Minor Landing craft, and the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group manned Centaur IV tanks on D Day; one of these is still on display at Pegasus Bridge.

Only one marine (Corporal Thomas Peck Hunter of 43 Commando) was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War for action at Lake Comacchio in Italy. Hunter was the most recent RM Commando to be awarded the medal. The Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment under Blondie Haslar carried out Operation Frankton and provided the basis for the post-war continuation of the SBS.

===Post-colonial era===
The Corps underwent a notable change after 1945 however, when the Royal Marines took on the main responsibility for the role and training of the British Commandos. , since their creation in 1942 Royal Marines Commandos had engaged on active operations across the globe, every year except 1968. Notably they provided the first military unit to perform an air assault insertion by helicopter, during the Suez Crisis in 1956. They were also part of the land element during the 1982 Falklands War.

43 Commando was active as amphibious infantry from 1961 to 1968, and 41 Commando was disbanded in 1981.

=== After 1945 and the Cold War ===
In 1946 the Army Commandos were disbanded, leaving the Royal Marines to continue the commando role (with supporting army elements). During the Cold War the Royal Marines were earmarked to reinforce NATO&#x27;s northernmost command Allied Forces North Norway. Therefore, 3 Commando Brigade began to train annually in Northern Norway and had large stores of vehicles and supplies pre-positioned there. At the end of the Cold War in 1989 the structure of the Royal Marines was as follows:

* Commandant General Royal Marines, London 
** 3 Commando Brigade, Plymouth
*** 40 Commando, Taunton
*** 42 Commando, Bickleigh
*** 45 Commando, Arbroath
*** 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery, Plymouth, one battery in Arbroath, (18× L118 light guns)
*** 4 Assault Squadron, Plymouth (4× LCU Mk.9, 4× LCVP Mk.4, 2× Centurion BARV), served aboard 
*** 539 Assault Squadron, Plymouth (4× LCU Mk.9, 4× LCVP Mk.4, 2× Centurion BARV), served aboard 
*** 59 Independent Commando Squadron, Royal Engineers, Plymouth, one troop in Arbroath
*** 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron, RNAS Yeovilton, (12× Gazelle AH.1, 6× Lynx AH.1)

*** 131 Independent Commando Squadron, Royal Engineers (V), Kingsbury, London 
*** 289 Commando Battery, Royal Artillery (V), East Ham (6× L118 light guns)
** Special Boat Service, Poole, under operational control of United Kingdom Special Forces
** Comacchio Group, HMNB Clyde, guarded HMNB Clyde and the UK&#x27;s naval nuclear weapons stored at RNAD Coulport

Royal Marines were involved in the Korean War. 41 (Independent) Commando was reformed in 1950, and was originally envisaged as a raiding force for use against North Korea. It performed this role in partnership with the United States Navy until after the landing of United States Army X Corps at Wonsan. It then joined the US&#x27;s 1st Marine Division at Koto-Ri. As Task Force Drysdale with Lt. Col. D.B. Drysdale RM in command, 41 Commando, a USMC company, a US Army company and part of the divisional train fought their way from Koto-Ri to Hagaru after the Chinese had blocked the road to the North. It then took part in the famous withdrawal from Chosin Reservoir. After that, a small amount of raiding followed, before the Marines were withdrawn from the conflict in 1951. It received the Presidential Citation after the USMC got the regulations modified to allow foreign units to receive the award.

After playing a part in the long-running Malayan Emergency, the next action came in 1956, during the Suez Crisis. Headquarters 3 Commando Brigade, and Nos 40, 42 and 45 Commandos took part in the operation. It marked the first time that a helicopter assault was used operationally to land troops in an amphibious attack. British and French forces defeated the Egyptians, but after pressure from the United States, and French domestic pressure, they backed down.

In September 1955 45 Commando was deployed to Cyprus to undertake anti-terrorist operations against the EOKA guerrillas during the independence war against the British. The EOKA were a small, but powerful organisation of Greek Cypriots, who had great local support from the Greek community. The unit, based in Malta at the time travelled to the Kyrenia mountain area of the island and in December 1955 launched Operation Foxhunter, an operation to destroy EOKA&#x27;s main base.

Further action in the Far East was seen during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. Nos 40 and 42 Commando went to Borneo at various times to help keep Indonesian forces from worsening situations in the neighbouring region, in what was an already heated part of the world, with conflicts in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. During the campaign there was a company-strength amphibious assault by Lima Company of 42 Commando at the town of Limbang to rescue hostages. The Limbang raid saw three of the 150 marines involved decorated, L company 42 commando are still referred to today as Limbang Company in memory of this archetypal commando raid.

In January 1964, part of the Tanzanian Army mutinied. Within 24 hours elements of 41 Commando had left Bickleigh Camp, Plymouth, Devon, and were travelling by air to Nairobi, Kenya, continuing by road into Tanzania. At the same time, Commandos aboard HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; sailed to East Africa and anchored off-shore from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The revolt was put down and the next six months were spent in touring Tanzanian military out-posts disarming military personnel.

From 1969 onwards, Royal Marine units regularly deployed to Northern Ireland during The Troubles, during the course of which 13 were killed in action. A further eleven died in the Deal barracks bombing of the Royal Marines School of Music in 1989. Between 1974 and 1984, the Royal Marines undertook three United Nations tours of duty in Cyprus. The first was in November 1974, when 41 Commando took over the Limassol District from the 2nd Battalion of the Guards Brigade, following the Turkish invasion, and became the first commando to wear the light blue berets of the UN when they began the Corps&#x27; first six-month tour with the UN forces in Cyprus (UNIFCYP).

The Falklands War provided the backdrop to the next action of the Royal Marines. Argentina invaded the islands in April 1982. A British task force was immediately despatched to recapture them, and given that an amphibious assault would be necessary, the Royal Marines were heavily involved. 3 Commando Brigade was brought to full combat strength, with not only 40, 42 and 45 Commandos, but also the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Parachute Regiment attached. The troops were landed at San Carlos Water at the western end of East Falkland, and proceeded to &quot;yomp&quot; across the entire island to the capital, Stanley, which fell on 14 June 1982 to 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment. A Royal Marines divisional headquarters was deployed, under Major-General Jeremy Moore, who was commander of British land forces during the war.

The main element of 3 Commando Brigade was not deployed in the 1991 Gulf War. However, 24 men from K Company, 42 Commando Royal Marines were deployed as six-man teams aboard two Royal Navy destroyers and frigates. They were used as ship boarding parties and took part in numerous boardings of suspect shipping. There were also further elements deployed to provide protection of shipping whilst in ports throughout the Gulf. The main element of 3 Commando Brigade was deployed to northern Iraq in the aftermath to provide aid to the Iraqi Kurds as part of Operation Safe Haven.

In 1992 recruiting into the RM Band Service was opened to females. From 2000 onwards, the Royal Marines began converting from their traditional light infantry role with the introduction of the Commando 21 concept, an emphasis on force protection leading to the introduction of the Viking, the first armoured vehicle to be operated by the Royal Marines for half a century.

==Current status and deployment==

===Personnel===
The Royal Marines are part of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service, alongside the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and they are under the full command of the Fleet Commander. Despite that, the rank structure of the Royal Marines is the same as that of the British Army. Uniquely, in the Royal Marines, officers and all other ranks undergo initial, commando and specialist training together at the Commando Training Centre, Royal Marines (CTCRM).

On average, 26,000 men apply to join the Royal Marines Commandos every year, but only 400 make it.

At its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 70,000 men served in the Royal Marines. Following the Allied victory the Royal Marines were quickly reduced to a post-war strength of 13,000. When National Service was ended in 1960, the Marines were again reduced, but this time to an all Commando-trained force of 9,000 personnel. As of 1 January 2021, the Royal Marines had a strength of 5,968 Regulars, and a combined strength of 6,500 when including reserves. The Royal Marines are also the only British naval unit capable of conducting amphibious operations at brigade level.

===Equipment===
====Light weapons====
The basic personal weapon of the Royal Marines Commandos is the 5.56mm C8 carbine rifle, sometimes fitted with the L123A3 underslung grenade launcher. Support fire is provided by the L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) and the L111A1 heavy machine gun (which is often mounted on an armoured vehicle); indirect fire is by the L16A2 81mm mortar. Sniper rifles used include the L115A3, produced by Accuracy International. More recently the L129A1 has come into service as the designated marksman rifle. Other weapons include the Javelin anti tank guided missile, the NLAW disposable anti tank missile, MATADOR anti-structure recoilless rifle, the L131A1 pistol and the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife. The Royal Marines are in the process of replacing all of their L85 rifles with the L119 and the KS-1 (L403).

====Armour====
The Royal Marines maintain no heavy armoured units, instead, they operate a fleet of lightly armoured and highly mobile vehicles intended for amphibious landings or rapid deployment. The primary armoured fighting vehicle operated by the Viking Squadron is the BvS 10 Viking All Terrain Armoured Vehicle. Other, lighter vehicles include the Land Rover Wolf, and the Jackal 2 (MWMIK) protected patrol vehicle.

====Artillery====
Field artillery support is provided by 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery of the British Army using the L118 Light Gun, a 105 mm towed howitzer. The regiment is Commando-trained.

====Aviation====
The Commando Helicopter Force of the Fleet Air Arm provides transport helicopters in support of the Royal Marines. It currently uses both Merlin HC4/4A medium-lift transport and Wildcat AH1 light transport/reconnaissance helicopters to provide direct aviation support for the Corps. In addition, the Royal Air Force provides Chinook heavy-lift and Puma HC2 medium-lift transport helicopters, and the British Army provides Apache AH-64E attack helicopter gunship support.

====Vessels====
The Royal Marines operate a varied fleet of military watercraft designed to transport troops and materiel from ship to shore or conduct river or estuary patrols. These include the Mk10 Landing Craft Utility and the Mk5b Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, and the BAE Fast Interceptor Craft and MK 11 Shallow Water Combat Submersible used by the Special Boat Service. Other smaller amphibious craft such as the Offshore Raiding Craft, Rigid Raider and Inflatable Raiding Craft are in service in much greater numbers.

==Organisation ==
=== Command structure ===
The overall head of the Royal Marines is King Charles III, in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. The ceremonial head of the Royal Marines is the Captain General Royal Marines. In October 2022 King Charles was announced as the new Captain General on the occasion of the 358th anniversary of the foundation of the corps. Full Command of the Royal Marines is vested in the Fleet Commander (FLTCDR).

The operational capability of the corps comprises a number of battalion-plus sized units, of which six are designated as &quot;commandos&quot;:

*Commando Units
** 40 Commando, Royal Marines (known as &quot;Forty&quot; Commando) based at RM Norton Manor, Taunton, Somerset, England
** 45 Commando, Royal Marines (known as &quot;Four Five&quot; Commando) based at RM Condor, Arbroath, Angus, Scotland
*Maritime Security
** 42 Commando, Royal Marines (known as &quot;Four Two&quot; Commando) based at RM Bickleigh, Plymouth, Devon, England
*Nuclear Deterrent Protection
**43 Commando Fleet Protection Group, Royal Marines based at HM Naval Base Clyde, Faslane, Argyll and Bute.
*Intelligence, Surveillance and Target Acquisition
** 30 Commando (Information Exploitation) Group, Royal Marines based at Stonehouse Barracks, Plymouth
*** Surveillance Reconnaissance Squadron (SRS)
**** Brigade Patrol Troop
*Raiding 
** 47 Commando (Raiding Group), Royal Marines based at RM Tamar, Devonport (previously 1 Assault Group RM)
*Logistic Support
** Commando Logistic Regiment based at RM Chivenor, Devon
*** Viking Squadron is an element of the Royal Marines that operates the Viking BvS 10 All Terrain Vehicle. It is based at Stanley Barracks, Bovington Garrison in Dorset.
With the exception of 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group and the Commando Logistic Regiment, which are each commanded by a full colonel, each of these units is commanded by a lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Marines, who may have sub-specialised in a number of ways throughout their career.
*Royal Marines Band Service
**Band of HM Royal Marines, Portsmouth (HMS &quot;Nelson&quot;)
**Band of HM Royal Marines, Plymouth ()
**Band of HM Royal Marines, Scotland (MoD Caledonia, Rosyth)
**Band of HM Royal Marines, (replacing the Band of Britannia Royal Naval College)
**Band of HM Royal Marines, Commando Training Centre Royal Marines
**The Band of the Royal Marines School of Music in Portsmouth (The Training Band)

===UK Commando Force===

Operational command of the five commandos and the Commando Logistics Regiment is delegated to UK Commando Force, of which they are a part. Based at Stonehouse Barracks, the brigade exercises control as directed by either CINCFLEET or the Permanent Joint Headquarters. 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a battalion-sized formation providing information operations capabilities, life support and security for the Brigade Headquarters.

43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, responsible for the security of the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear deterrent and other security-related duties was originally outside the brigade, but was incorporated into it from April 2012. It also provides specialist boarding parties and snipers for the Royal Navy worldwide, for roles such as embargo enforcement, counter-narcotics, counter-piracy and counter-insurgency activities of the Royal Navy. It is the largest unit in the brigade, at 790 strong.

===Other elements===
The other elements of the Royal Marines outside of the UK Commando Force are:

* Commando Training Centre: This is the training unit for the entire corps, and consists of three separate sections:
** Commando Training Wing: This is the initial basic commando training section for new recruits to the Royal Marines, and the UK Forces All Arms Commando Course.
** Specialist Wing: This provides specialist training in the various trades which Marines may elect to join once qualified and experienced in a Rifle Company.
** Command Wing: This provides command training for both officers and NCOs of the Royal Marines.
* Royal Marines Band Service provides regular bands for the Royal Navy and provides expertise to train RN Volunteer Bands. Musicians have an important secondary roles as medics, field hospital orderlies, CBRN specialists and any other roles that may be required of them. Personnel may not be commando trained, usually wearing the dark blue beret instead of green; until 2017, the band service was the only branch of the Royal Marines to admit women.

===Structure of a commando===

40 and 45 Commando are each organised into six companies, further organised into platoon-sized troops, as follows:

* Command company
** Main HQ
** Tactical HQ
** Reconnaissance Troop with a sniper section
** Mortar Troop
** Anti-Tank (AT) Troop
** Medium Machine Gun Troop
* 2× Close Combat Companies
** Company Headquarters
** 3× Close Combat Troops
* 2× Stand Off Companies
** Company Headquarters
** Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) Troop
** AT Troop
** Close Combat Troop.
* Logistic Company
** A Echelon 1
** A Echelon 2
** FRT (Forward Repair Team)
** RAP (Regimental Aid Post)
** B Echelon

In general a rifle company Marine will be a member of a four-man fire team, the building block of commando operations. A Royal Marine works with their team in the field and shares accommodation if living in barracks. This structure is a recent development, formerly Commandos were structured similarly to British Army light infantry battalions.

===Commando Helicopter Force===

The Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) forms part of the Fleet Air Arm. It comprises three helicopter squadrons and is commanded by the Joint Aviation Command. It consists of both Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Marines personnel. RN personnel need not be commando trained. The CHF is neither under the permanent control of UK Commando Force nor that of the Commandant General Royal Marines, but rather is allocated to support Royal Marines units as required. It uses both Merlin HC4/4A medium-lift and Wildcat AH1 light transport/reconnaissance helicopters to provide aviation support for the Royal Marines.

==Future Commando Force (FCF) Programme==
On 11 April 2017 the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Philip Jones, announced that the Royal Marines Commandos were to be restructured, and will be capable of deploying on special operations as part of the Future Commando Force (FCF) Programme. Indeed, the Ministry of Defence has also said that under the FCF programme, the Royal Marines Commandos will take on many of the traditional tasks of the SAS and SBS, alongside a new Army Ranger Regiment. As part of this programme, Navy Command is also creating the staff and intellectual horsepower for a land littoral strike division programme. An example of the FCF was depicted by young engineering graduates from the UK Naval Engineering Science and Technology forum (UKNEST). There will be two Littoral Response Groups: One based East of Suez, one based in the High North. On 27 June 2020, the Royal Marines announced they will adopt a new uniform with the MultiCam camouflage instead of the MTP camo.

==Selection==
=== Process ===

Royal Marine Commandos are required to undergo the longest and one of the most physically demanding specialist infantry training courses in the world. Recruit training lasts for 36 weeks for Royal Marine Commandos and 64 weeks for Royal Marine Commando Officers. Potential recruits must be aged 16 to 32 (18 to 25 for Commissioned Officers). Applicants must undertake a series of interviews, medical tests, an eye/sight test, psychometric tests, a PJFA (pre-joining fitness Assessment), a 5-day CPC (candidate preparation course), and a 4-week ROP (recruit orientation phase). If an applicant successfully completes all of these phases, then they will get selected for a place in mainstream recruit training, which will take place at CTCRM (commando training centre Royal Marines) in Lympstone, Devon, UK. A large proportion of training is carried out on Dartmoor&#x27;s inhospitable terrain and Woodbury Common woodland.

=== Training ===
Throughout recruit training, Royal Marines Commando recruits learn and develop a vast amount of knowledge and warfighting skills such as weapons handling, marksmanship, proficiency with a variety of different firearms and weapon systems, unarmed and armed close quarters combat (CQC), develop elite levels of physical fitness and mental resilience, demolition, reconnaissance, small team tactics, small boat operations, breaching, raiding, direct action, SERE training, fieldcraft skills such as camouflage and stalking, survival skills, bushcraft, mountaineering, fast-roping (helicopter), abseiling, vertical assault, underwater escape, chemical biological radiological nuclear (CBRN) training, military communications and signals, map reading and navigation, leadership and teamwork skills, first aid, patrolling and sentry duty, amphibious landings training, personal administration, and marching and parade ground skills.

The best recruit to finish training is awarded the Kings Badge. King George V directed that his Royal Cypher, surrounded by a laurel wreath, would be known as the King&#x27;s Badge, and would be awarded to the best all round recruit in the King&#x27;s Squad, provided that he was worthy of the honour. The badge was to be carried on the left shoulder, and worn in every rank. The King&#x27;s Badge is not awarded to every squad, and is only presented if a recruit measures up to the very exacting standards required.

Throughout their career, a Royal Marine Commando can specialise in a number of different roles upon completion of their respective courses after spending one to two years as a general duties (GD) rifleman at a unit. Examples of some specialisations and different courses includes the mountain leader (ML), physical training instructor (PTI), Assault Engineer (AE), Royal Marines police (RMP), sniper (S), medical assistant (MA), pilot, reconnaissance operator (RO), drill instructor (DL), driver (D), clerk (C), signaller (SI), combat intelligence (CI), armourer (A), and heavy weapons (HW). Royal Marines can also apply for swimmer canoeist/Special Boat Service selection (SBS) or any other branch of the UKSF. All Royal Marines will also conduct training exercises on differing military skills on a regular basis including development in mountain, arctic, jungle, amphibious and desert warfare. They can also be involved in exchange training programs with other countries&#x27; forces – particularly the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps/Korps Mariniers.

==Museum==
The Royal Marines Museum (established in October 1958) is an institution dedicated to the history of the Royal Marines. In 2011, it became part of the National Museum of the Royal Navy, which has since been the executive public body of the museum in the Ministry of Defence. It will soon be moving from Eastney Barracks to Portsmouth Dockyard.
==Customs==
=== Traditions ===
The Royal Marines have a proud history and unique traditions. With the exceptions of &quot;Gibraltar&quot; and the laurel wreath for the Battle of Belle Island, their colours (flags) do not carry battle honours in the manner of the regiments of the British Army or of the US Marine Corps, but rather the &quot;globe itself&quot; as a symbol of the Corps.

The heraldic badge of the Royal Marines commemorates the history of the Corps. The Lion and Crown denotes a Royal regiment. King George III conferred this honour in 1802 &quot;in consideration of the very meritorious services of the Marines in the late war.&quot; The &quot;Great Globe itself&quot; was chosen in 1827 by King George IV in place of battle honours to recognise the Marines&#x27; service and successes in multiple engagements in every quarter of the world. The laurels are believed to honour the gallantry they displayed during the investment and capture of Belle Isle, off Lorient, in April–June 1761. The word &quot;Gibraltar&quot; refers to the Capture of Gibraltar by a force of Anglo-Dutch Marines in 1704 and the subsequent defence of the strategic fortress throughout a nine-month siege against a numerically superior Franco-Spanish force. Their determination and valour throughout the siege led to a contemporary report published in &quot;The Triumphs of Her Majesty&#x27;s Arms&quot; in 1707 to announce:

There are no other battle honours displayed on the colours of the four battalion-sized units of the current Corps. The Latin motto &quot;Per Mare Per Terram&quot; translates into English as &quot;By Sea By Land&quot;. Believed to have been first used in 1775, this motto describes the Royal Marines ability in fighting both afloat on-board ships of the Royal Navy as well as ashore in their many land engagements. The fouled anchor, incorporated into the emblem in 1747, is the badge of the Lord High Admiral, and shows that the Corps is part of the Naval Service.

The regimental quick march of the Corps is &quot;A Life on the Ocean Wave&quot;, while the slow march is the march of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, awarded to the Corps by Admiral of the Fleet Earl Mountbatten of Burma on the occasion of the Corps&#x27;s tercentenary in 1964. Lord Mountbatten was Life Colonel Commandant of the Royal Marines until his murder by the IRA in 1979.

The Royal Marines are allowed by the Lord Mayor of the City of London to march through the City as a regiment in full array. This dates to the charter of Charles II that allowed recruiting parties of the Admiral&#x27;s Regiment of 1664 to enter the city with drums beating and colours flying.
===Uniforms===
Modern Royal Marines uniforms are broadly similar to British Army uniforms but include a number of distinctive uniform items. These include the green &quot;Lovat&quot; shade of service dress uniform; the green beret (for those who have passed the commando course) or navy blue beret with a scarlet patch behind the badge (for those who have not); dark blue parade dress worn with either the white Wolseley Pattern Helmet (commonly referred to as &quot;pith helmet&quot;) or white and red peaked cap; the scarlet and blue mess dress for officers and senior non-commissioned officers; and the white hot-weather uniform of the Band Service.

For historical information regarding Marine uniforms, see &quot;Uniforms of the Royal Marines&quot;.

=== Ranks and insignia ===
The Royal Marines rank alongside their army equivalents. However, when on the books of any HM Ship or Naval Establishment, Royal Marines were subject to the Naval Discipline Act 1957. In those circumstances, many officer ranks in the Royal Marines formerly enjoyed greater status. Second lieutenants were equivalent to sub lieutenants and ranks from lieutenant to major were considered equivalent to one rank higher (OF-2 to OF-4). Lieutenant colonels were considered equivalent to RN captains with less than six years in the rank, and colonels were equivalent to captains with more than six years seniority. This state of affairs ended on 1 July 1999, when Royal Marine officer ranks were fully aligned with those of the army.

==== Captain General ====

The current uniform and insignia worn by the Captain General Royal Marines, presently King Charles III, is the uniform and insignia of field marshal, consisting of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below a Crown.

However, as Captain General Royal Marines, Prince Harry was instead entitled to wear the rank insignia of a Major General. Despite this, Prince Harry, at least on some occasions, opted to wear the rank insignia of a Colonel, traditionally worn by some Colonels-in-chief in the British Army.

== Associations with other regiments and marine corps ==
===Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders===
Early connections date from Balaclava in the Crimean War and Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the main association stems from World War II. In July 1940, after the fall of Dunkirk, the 5th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders served with the Royal Marine Brigade for over a year. When the battleships and were sunk in December 1941, the Royal Marines survivors joined up with the remnants of the 2nd Battalion, in the defence of Singapore. They formed what became known as &#x27;The Plymouth Argylls&#x27;, after the association football team, since both ships were Plymouth manned. Most of the Highlanders and Marines who survived the bitter fighting were taken prisoner by the Japanese. The Royal Marines inter-unit rugby football trophy is the &#x27;Argyll Bowl&#x27;, presented to the Corps by the Regiment in 1941.

===Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment===
The fore-bearer regiments of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment, 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot was initially raised as amphibious troops. They served as Marines for a period. To this day one officer from the Royal Marines serves with the PWRR and Vice Versa. Also the Royal Marine Lanyard is worn by all ranks in Service Dress and Number 2 Dress uniform and barrack dress of PWRR.

===United States Marine Corps===
The Royal Marines and the United States Marine Corps have close cultural links arising from the Special Relationship, having trained together and fought together on multiple occasions.

===Barbados Defence Force===
Close links have existed between the Royal Marines and the Barbados Defence Force since 1985 when a bond was established following a series of cross-training exercises in the Caribbean. The Alliance was approved by HM the Queen in 1992.

===Netherlands Marine Corps===
The Royal Marines have close links with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps, with whom they conduct NATO exercises throughout the year. Units of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps work in close co-operation with 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines. Operational units of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps are fully integrated into this brigade. This integration is known as the United Kingdom-Netherlands Landing Force and is a component of the United Kingdom-Netherlands Amphibious Force as a key strike force during the Cold War to strengthen the Nordic area.

===French 9th Marine Infantry Brigade (former 9th Light Armoured Marine Brigade)===
The 9th Marine Infantry Brigade (, 9e BIMa) is a Marine infantry brigade which is one of the two designated amphibious brigades in France. It is unique in being the only &#x27;All Marine&#x27; Brigade in the French Army; the other amphibious brigade, 6th Light Armoured Brigade (, 6e BLB), is composed of a mix of cap badges. 9e BIMa is also a light armoured brigade, formed of two Marine infantry regiments (2e RIMa and 3e RIMa — ) and a tank battalion.

<text>The London Borough of Hounslow ( ) is a London borough in west London, England, forming part of Outer London. It is governed by Hounslow London Borough Council.

The borough stretches from near Central London in the east (Chiswick) to the border with Surrey in the west (Feltham and Bedfont), covering five major towns: Chiswick (W4), Brentford (TW8), Isleworth (TW7), Hounslow (TW3, TW4, TW5) and Feltham (TW13, TW14); it borders the boroughs of Richmond upon Thames, Hammersmith and Fulham, Ealing and Hillingdon, in addition to the Spelthorne district of Surrey.

The borough is home to the London Museum of Water &amp; Steam and the attractions of Osterley Park, Gunnersbury Park, Syon House, and Chiswick House. Moreover, landmarks straddling the border of Hounslow include; Twickenham Stadium and London Heathrow Airport in the London Boroughs of Richmond-upon-Thames and Hillingdon respectively.

==Toponymy==
The town of Hounslow, which has existed since the 13th century, is located at the centre of the Borough of Hounslow. The name Hounslow means &#x27;Hund&#x27;s mound&#x27;; the personal name Hund is followed by the Old English &quot;hlaew&quot; meaning mound or barrow. (The mound may have been his burial place.) It was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Honeslaw&quot;.

==History==
The borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick, the Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth and Feltham Urban District. The area was transferred from Middlesex to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs. The new borough was named Hounslow after the town at the centre of the new borough. The old Heston and Isleworth district had nearly been renamed Hounslow in 1927; a large majority of voters in a referendum had supported the change of name, but it was vetoed by Middlesex County Council.

The borough is an outer borough of Greater London and lies on the north bank of the River Thames. It is the site of the first stop on an important coach route to Southampton, Bath, Bristol and Exeter. The A30 Great South West Road, which runs down to Penzance in Cornwall, starts in the borough. Hounslow town developed on either side of the main Great West Road (now the A3006/A4 Bath Road ) from London to the West of England, causing a large number of inns to be built to serve the travellers. A few, such as &quot;The Bell&quot; retain their names, although the buildings have largely been replaced. The Bell marks the former junction of the coaching routes of the A314 Hanworth Road, A315 Staines Road, A3005 Lampton Road and the A3006 Bath Road. Historic milestones are preserved on the Staines Road (now re-numbered as the A315 but joining the &quot;old&quot; A30 again just inside the borough&#x27;s western boundary)

Hounslow grew rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century due to other travel, a connection to the largest of London&#x27;s airports since the 1940s, Heathrow Airport which is in the Hounslow post town but administratively in the London Borough of Hillingdon. Aviation in the area dates to the early 1900s when one of London&#x27;s earliest airfields was situated on Hounslow Heath because of the extremely flat terrain. The Great West Road, which crosses the borough from Chiswick to Heathrow, at one time served nationally and globally famous manufacturers including Firestone, Gillette and Coty. As a result, the area became known as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;. A few of these factory sites remain today, such as Gillette Corner, and the Great West Road is still home to many prestigious names (see &quot;famous companies&quot; below), providing them with easy non-motorway access between Slough, London Heathrow Airport and Central London.

==Geography==

===List of districts in Hounslow===
Main settlements (head district is located in the borough):

Although the majority of these towns are situated in the borough, many smaller settlements that comprise them are located in adjacent boroughs. Approximately a third of Chiswick – north of the London Underground (District/Piccadilly line) railway line – falls within the London Borough of Ealing. A few roads in Brentford (around Claypond Hospital) and Isleworth (south of the River Crane and around Whitton) lay within the London Boroughs of Ealing and Richmond upon Thames respectively. A significant minority of Hounslow – south of the railway and southeast of Hounslow Heath – fall within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, whilst some of Hounslow – west of the River Crane – falls within the London Borough of Hillingdon. Minor parts of Feltham fall within the Borough of Spelthorne in Surrey, meaning that these parts of the town are situated outside Greater London.

<doc id="93994" wikidata="Q146671" url="?curid=93994" title="Erith">
<text>Erith () is an area in south-east London, England, east of Charing Cross. Before the creation of Greater London in 1965, it was in the historical county of Kent. Since 1965 it has formed part of the London Borough of Bexley. It lies north-east of Bexleyheath and north-west of Dartford, on the south bank of the River Thames. 

The town centre has been modernised with further dwellings added since 1961. The curved riverside high street has three listed buildings, including the Church of England church and the Carnegie Building. Erith otherwise consists mainly of suburban housing. It is linked to central London and Kent by rail and to Thamesmead by a dual carriageway. It has the longest pier in London, and retains a coastal environment with salt marshes alongside industrial land.

==History==
===Pre-medieval===
Work carried out at the former British Gypsum site in Church Manorway by the Museum of London Archaeological Service shows that the area was covered by a dense forest of oak, yew and alder in the Neolithic Period, which by the Bronze Age had given way in part to sedge fen.

The museum&#x27;s work at the former site of Erith School in Belmont Road revealed traces of prehistoric settlement and a substantial community or farmstead in the first century CE.

===Anglo-Saxons===
After the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, Britain was colonised by Anglo-Saxon invaders from northern Europe. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that they won the Battle of Crecganford (thought to be modern Crayford) in 457 and shortly after claimed the whole of Kent. Their different way of life was reflected in their settlement pattern. The town and country estates of Roman bureaucrats gave way to a network of villages occupied by warriors and farmers. Erith was one such and has a Saxon name, originally &quot;Ærre hyðe&quot; meaning &quot;old haven&quot;.

There was probably a church on the site of the present St John the Baptist&#x27;s in the Anglo-Saxon period. The early settlement was based around it, meaning that the centre of Erith was once west of its current location.

===Medieval===

The earliest written reference to the area is in a Latin charter of 695, recording a grant by the Bishop of the East Saxons of land at Erith. The surrounding area was known as Lesnes or Lessness, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Norman Conquest, Lessness passed into the possession of Bishop Odo. In 1315, a Royal Charter was granted for a market to be held in Erith every Thursday, but it was noted in 1776 that the market was long discontinued.

Erith owes its existence to the Thames, and was until the 1850s essentially a small riverside port, given prominence by King Henry VIII&#x27;s decision to open a naval dockyard there, approximately where the Riverside Gardens are now. Henry&#x27;s famous warship, &quot;Henri Grace à Dieu&quot;, was fitted out there in 1515.

After the death of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury in 1538, Erith &quot;alias Lysnes&quot; was granted to his widow, Elizabeth, by Henry VIII &quot;with all its members and appurtenances, to hold in capite, by knight&#x27;s service.&quot;

Erith remained a popular anchorage until the 19th century. Ships often discharged cargo there to reduce their displacement before entering shallows upstream.

===Industrial era===
In 1797 Edward Hasted described Erith as &quot;one small street of houses, which leads to the water side&quot;, and mentions annual fairs at Ascension and Michaelmas. In 1831 Erith&#x27;s population was 1,533. It was composed in 1840 &quot;chiefly of two streets, one leading down to the water side, the other branching off to the left towards the church.&quot;

By 1849 Erith was enjoying a short spell as a riverside resort. Its pier and nearby hotel gave hospitality for day-trippers arriving on Thames pleasure boats or by rail. An arboretum with extensive pleasure grounds was opened to attract visitors.

The Local Government Act 1894 brought into existence Erith Urban District, which became the Municipal Borough of Erith in 1938. It included Northumberland Heath and Belvedere.

Erith Iron Works was established in 1864 on a riverside site at Anchor Bay, east of Erith&#x27;s centre, by William Anderson.

On 1 October 1864 a 46½-ton gunpowder explosion blew out the river wall, exposing large areas of South London to flooding at high tide. A crowd of navvies and soldiers directed by a local engineer managed to plug the gap just before high water.

From 1881 an area north-west of Erith&#x27;s centre was the site of a cable works founded by William Callender. This became British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Cables (BICC) and eventually Pirelli, which announced its partial closure in 2003. The remainder became Prysmian.

===20th century===
Erith&#x27;s first library, designed by local architect William Egerton and funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, opened in 1906.

Engineering became an important industry in Erith, with armaments and cables as the main products. Vickers was a major employer, with links to the Royal Arsenal at nearby Woolwich.
During the First World War Erith was an important area for the manufacture of guns and ammunition, largely due to the presence of the large Vickers works. In the Second World War, the town suffered heavy bomb damage, mainly because of its riverside position near the Royal Arsenal. The bomb damage and a gradual decline in local trade prompted major redevelopment in the 1960s.
In 1961, Erith began to be redeveloped as a modern shopping and working environment, through the clearing of sub-standard housing by the riverside and alterations to the street layout. Some of the new buildings, such as the social housing tower blocks, have a brutalist form typical of overspill estates built by councils in major cities as an affordable way to clear the slums.

In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, Erith became part of the London Borough of Bexley.
Demolition of the old town started in 1966 and continued in phases until 1980, leaving only a few reminders of the old town centre. Many of the original Victorian buildings were lost, but some original townscape remains, including the &quot;White Hart&quot; in the High Street and St John&#x27;s Church in West Street.

===Regeneration===
Since the late 1990s Erith has undergone marked changes, culminating in the Erith Western Thames Gateway project. The regeneration falls within the remit of the Thames Gateway project, with Erith as a focus for Bexley Council, as its only population centre on the River Thames. Since 2000 a significant number of new flats have been built on the river by private developers. The Erith Western Gateway will include riverside flats, and is expected to include the regeneration of a large underused area of the town centre, earmarked by Bexley Council for a mixed-use development with up to 6,000 sq. m of new commercial space and over 500 new homes.

In 2020, local campaigners secured National Lottery funding to restore the former library building as new community facilities.

==Demography==
The population of Erith is 62% White British, according to the 2011 census, down from 82% in 2001 and 89% in 1991. The second highest ethnicity is Black African, at 14%.

The median house price in Erith ward was £181,000 in 2014, the third lowest of the 628 wards in Greater London, with only neighbouring Belvedere and the Abbey ward of Barking and Dagenham having lower prices.

==Representation==

Much of Erith is in the Erith ward of the London Borough of Bexley. The local councillors are Joe Ferreira and Nicola Taylor (both Labour). The eastern part of Erith is in North End ward and the southern part in Colyers ward.

Most of Erith lies within the Erith and Thamesmead constituency. The current Member of Parliament is Abena Oppong-Asare (Labour). The eastern part of Erith is within the Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency, whose MP is Daniel Francis (Labour).

Erith is in the Bexley and Bromley London Assembly constituency and is represented on the London Assembly by Thomas Turrell (Conservative).

<doc id="93996" wikidata="Q383914" url="?curid=93996" title="Darkwing Duck">
<text>Darkwing Duck is an American animated superhero comedy television series produced by Disney Television Animation (formerly Walt Disney Television Animation) that first ran from 1991 to 1992 on both the syndicated programming block &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; and Saturday mornings on ABC. A total of ninety-one episodes were aired. It features the adventures of Darkwing Duck, who is the superheroic alter-ego of ordinary suburban duck Drake Mallard.

Though it was originally thought by some fans to be a spin-off of the 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, creator Tad Stones stated in a 2016 report that the two shows exist in different universes. Despite this, supporting characters Launchpad McQuack and Gizmoduck appear in both series in similar roles, and Scrooge McDuck is mentioned in the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode &quot;Tiff of the Titans&quot;, and thus established a relation to both shows. Additionally, the 2011 comic book series &quot;DuckTales&quot; makes reference to Darkwing Duck and features various villains from the series. A crossover between the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; and &quot;DuckTales&quot; comics occurs in issues 17–18 and issues 5–6, respectively, of each. A reboot of the series is in development for Disney+.

==Premise==
&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; tells the adventures of the titular superhero, aided by his sidekick and pilot Launchpad McQuack (from &quot;DuckTales&quot;). In his secret identity of Drake Mallard (a parody of Kent Allard, the alter ego of the Shadow), he lives in an unassuming suburban house with his adopted daughter Gosalyn, next door to the dim-witted Muddlefoot family. Darkwing struggles to balance his egotistical craving for fame and attention against his desire to be a good father to Gosalyn and help do good in St. Canard. Most episodes put these two aspects of Darkwing&#x27;s character in direct conflict, though Darkwing&#x27;s better nature usually prevails.

The show was the first Disney Afternoon series to emphasize action rather than adventure, with Darkwing routinely engaging in slapstick battles with both supervillains and street criminals. While conflict with villains was routine in earlier Disney Afternoon shows, actual fight scenes were relatively rare.

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was also the first Disney Afternoon property that was produced completely as a genre parody. Prior shows would contain elements of parody in certain episodes, but would otherwise be straight-faced adventure concepts, this in the tradition of Carl Barks&#x27; work in the Disney comics. By contrast, every episode of &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; is laden with references to superhero, pulp adventure, or super-spy fiction. Darkwing Duck himself is a satirical character. His costume, gas gun and flashy introductions are all reminiscent of pulp heroes and Golden Age superheroes such as The Shadow, The Sandman, Doc Savage, Batman, The Green Hornet and the Julius Schwartz &quot;Flash&quot;, as well as The Lone Ranger and Zorro. The fictional city of St. Canard is a direct parody of Gotham City. (&quot;Canard&quot; is the French word for &quot;duck&quot;.)

==Episodes==

==Characters==
==Production==
&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was developed as a last-minute replacement with concept artwork by Michael Peraza for a proposed reboot of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, when the management team realized that Disney did not own the rights to the characters (Disney merely held home video rights to the series).

The show was a spin-off of the very successful series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; entered production roughly one year after &quot;DuckTales&quot; ended. &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was inspired by two specific episodes of &quot;DuckTales&quot;: &quot;Double-O-Duck&quot; starring Launchpad McQuack as a secret agent, and &quot;The Masked Mallard&quot; in which Scrooge McDuck becomes a masked vigilante superhero wearing a purple uniform and cape. The name &quot;The Masked Mallard&quot; became an epithet often used in the new show to refer to Darkwing himself.

Tad Stones was directed to come up with a series for The Disney Afternoon around the premise of &quot;Double-O-Duck&quot;, as an executive liked the title &quot;Double-O Duck&quot; as a spoof of James Bond and felt Launchpad McQuack would take the starring role. It turned out that the title &quot;Double-O Duck&quot; could not be used as the Broccoli family owned the &#x27;double-o&#x27; title.

A new name was selected, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;. Thus, Stones designed a new character for the lead, Drake Mallard, while selecting McQuack as the sidekick. This name would result in a new look (Double-O Duck was to wear a white tuxedo and black domino mask). Other elements of the show, such as Darkwing&#x27;s habit of coining new catchphrases every time he announced himself, would be invented during production. (As an in-joke, the episode &quot;A Duck by Any Other Name&quot; had Drake suggest &quot;Double-O Duck&quot; as his new secret identity and Launchpad remarked that it &quot;seems kinda silly&quot;.)

Where most prior &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; series included at least some preexisting animated characters, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; featured a completely original cast. Even the &quot;DuckTales&quot; characters it reused had no counterpart in early Disney shorts or the comics. The only exception was the episode &quot;In Like Blunt&quot;, which featured cameo appearances by the Beagle Boys, Flintheart Glomgold and Magica De Spell.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; first aired on The Disney Channel on March 31, 1991, as a &quot;sneak preview&quot;, and then from April 6 into July 14 of that year as a regularly scheduled run on weekend mornings, as it was advertised to be &quot;The newest animated TV series exclusively to The Disney Channel&quot;. In reality, this was a preview-run of the series before it aired on &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;.

The two-part episode &quot;Darkly Dawns the Duck&quot; originally aired as an hour-length TV special on September 6, 1991, as part of a larger syndicated TV special, &quot;The Darkwing Duck Premiere / Back to School with the Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. The film served as the show&#x27;s pilot. Seasons 1 and 2 were aired simultaneously in the autumn of 1991. Season 1 aired in syndication as part of &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; block of shows. Seasons 2 and 3 aired on Saturday mornings on ABC. The final episode aired on December 12, 1992. ABC stopped airing reruns of the show in September 1993, and it was replaced by &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. All episodes remained in syndicated reruns on &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; until 1995 and then returned to the lineup from 1996 to 1997.

Starting on October 2, 1995, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was rerun on The Disney Channel as part of a two-hour programming block called &quot;Block Party&quot; which aired on weekdays in the late-afternoon/early-evening and which also included &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;. On September 3, 1996, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was dropped from the beginning of the block when &quot;Goof Troop&quot; was added to the end.

The series was last seen in the U.S. on Toon Disney on January 19, 2007, as part of the Toon Disney Wild Card Stack. Certain episodes from the show&#x27;s original run rarely re-aired while the show was on Toon Disney. These episodes appear to have been removed for content reasons. The most prominent of the rarely seen episodes is &quot;Hot Spells&quot;, which was never re-aired after its initial broadcast on ABC because of its religiously sensitive subject matter.

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was one of the first American animated TV series to be officially broadcast in syndication in the former Soviet Union.

The show formerly aired on Disney XD in international territories such as the Netherlands and Germany.

The show is available on the Disney+ streaming service, with the exception of the episode &quot;Hot Spells&quot;.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval of 83% based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10.

Nigel Mitchell of &quot;CBR.com&quot; stated, &quot;He was the terror that flapped in the night. He was the fingernail that scraped the blackboard of your soul. He was Darkwing Duck, and he made a generation laugh and thrill with his crazy adventures. Following the success of &quot;Ducktales,&quot; the 1992 TV show &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was one of the first action-oriented shows on Disney&#x27;s block, and wasn&#x27;t like any other show on TV.&quot; Amanda Dyer of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; rated the series 4 out of 5 stars, writing, &quot;&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; is a 1990s Disney animated comedy that has slapstick cartoon violence (including weapon use) and mild name calling. It follows the heroic yet self-serving antics of cartoon duck superhero Darkwing Duck as he battles various wacky supervillains with his sidekick, Launchpad McQuack.&quot;

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was named the 93rd Best Animated Series by &quot;IGN&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the many reasons why after-school cartoons rule.&quot; &quot;Torgo&#x27;s Pizzeria Podcast&quot; gave a favorable retrospective review to &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; in April 2012; the podcast did however note some weaknesses with the series. Nick Caruso of &quot;TVLine&quot; lists the theme song from the series, performed by longtime &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; veteran Jeff Pescetto, among the best animated series themes of all time.

* &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; video game was released by Capcom on the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy as a platform side-scroller. The game was developed for the NES in 1992 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1993. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.
* &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (a different game with the same title) was also released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992 as an action side-scroller.
* A &quot;Disney&#x27;s Darkwing Duck&quot; hand-held LCD game from Tiger Electronics was also released in 1992.

Darkwing Duck himself is a townsperson in the 2.0 Toy Box. Darkwing Duck was close to being a playable character in 2.0 but was eventually scrapped. 
* &quot;Disney Infinity 3.0&quot; had Darkwing Duck close to being a playable character but lost to Olaf in the fan polls for the initial wave of Disney characters for 3.0.

===Comic books===
Disney Comics published a four-issue &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; comic book mini-series in late 1991, right around the time of the show&#x27;s syndicated premiere. This mini-series was an adaptation of a draft of the script for &quot;Darkly Dawns the Duck&quot;. Like the &quot;TaleSpin&quot; comic before it, it was meant to spin off a regular comic series, but the Disney Comics implosion happening at the time prevented that plan. However, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; stories were regularly printed in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine between the November 1991 and January 1996 issues. Additionally, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; stories were also regularly featured in Marvel Comics&#x27; short-lived &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; comic book.

====BOOM! Studios====
On March 13, 2010, BOOM! Studios announced that they would be releasing a four-issue &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; miniseries, titled &quot;The Duck Knight Returns&quot;, starting in June of that year. The series was written by Aaron Sparrow (uncredited), Ian Brill and drawn by James Silvani, and was set one year after the end of the show. BOOM! later announced that due to positive fan reaction, the comic series would be extended indefinitely as an ongoing title. This first trade paperback collection of the initial four issues of the comic was released in the fall of 2010

Unlike the original show, the comic strengthened &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;&#x27;s ties to the parent show &quot;DuckTales&quot; and began to use a number of Carl Barks characters like Magica De Spell (allied to Negaduck in the second story) and cameoing Scrooge McDuck and Gyro Gearloose. A 4-part crossover story with Disney&#x27;s &quot;DuckTales&quot;, titled &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot;, was released with parts 1 and 3 for &quot;DuckTales&quot; #5 and #6, and parts 2 and 4 for &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; #17 and #18. The comic also made a lot of homages to other Disney shows: Magica&#x27;s powered up form in #7 has emblems that reference film villains like Hades and Jafar, someone holds a sign saying &quot;Bring Back Bonkers&quot; in the background of #6, and #3 shows Launchpad tried to get a job with Gadget Hackwrench of the Rescue Rangers from &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;.

The eighteenth issue, which shipped in October 2011, was the end of the series due to BOOM! Studios prematurely losing the Disney Comics license. &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; Vol. 5 &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot; crossover, released in November 2011, was the final printing.

====Joe Books====
On January 20, 2016, it was reported that the series would be returning to the comic book format. Writers Aaron Sparrow and artist James Silvani, both of whom worked on the previous Darkwing Duck comic book that was published by Boom! returned to this comic. Additionally Andrew Dalhouse, Deron Bennett and Jesse Post assumed their roles on the creative team, with R. Janice Orlando, who worked on &quot;The Definitively Dangerous Edition,&quot; returning as Assistant Editor. Darkwing Duck is now wearing a purple necktie instead of his usual turtleneck.

The first issue debuted on April 27, 2016. Titled &quot;Orange is the New Purple&quot;. The comic was cancelled after eight issues due to poor sales.

====IDW Publishing====
On July 25, 2018, it was announced that the Boom! Studios would be reprinted in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Afternoon Giant&quot;. The first issue will be released in October 2018.

====Comic creatorship====
Throughout the run of BOOM! Studios&#x27; &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; comic series, there was controversy as to who was responsible for the series. Editor Aaron Sparrow is largely credited with the idea to relaunch the property and has claimed to have plotted the first arc and come up with many of the concepts for following story arcs. This has been publicly disputed by Boom and credited series writer Ian Brill. However, artist James Silvani has publicly credited Sparrow not only with the idea of bringing the series back, but assisting him in ghost-writing much of the series and changing a lot of the concepts Brill brought to the series following Sparrow&#x27;s departure from BOOM! Studios. This seems to be further corroborated by the fact that Sparrow and Silvani have both stated they did not write any of the final arc of the series, &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot;, which was largely panned by fans for having many glaring character inconsistencies, particularly in the case of the character Gizmoduck.

&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; creator Tad Stones has also publicly credited Sparrow as bringing the character back in a 2010 BOOM! Kids &quot;Get A Sketch&quot; panel at San Diego Comic-Con. Sparrow continues to make public appearances with Silvani and Stones, and Brill does not. In a 2011 livestream interview Tad Stones admitted he was unhappy with later issues of the series, and particularly criticized the election arc, which he &quot;tried to talk them out of&quot;. When questioned on whether he had read the entire comic series he stated: &quot;Not the later stuff. I applaud what James tried to do. I hear he saved them but I thought the central premises were wrong.&quot;

Sparrow served as moderator at the 2013 Comic-Con panel &quot;25 Years of the Disney Afternoon: The Continuing Legacy&quot;, which featured Tad Stones, voice actors Jim Cummings and Rob Paulsen, &quot;TaleSpin&quot; creator Jymn Magon, and &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; comic artist James Silvani, associations which would seem to further corroborate his version of events.

In 2013, Disney European publisher Egmont Group released a compendium of several of the BOOM! Studios &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; stories, including &quot;The Duck Knight Returns&quot;, &quot;Crisis On Infinite Darkwings&quot;, and &quot;F.O.W.L. Disposition&quot;. Aaron Sparrow&#x27;s story credits were not only restored, but he and Silvani created an all-new 3-page introduction, and Brill&#x27;s dialogue was replaced with original dialogue by Sparrow.

On October 22, 2014, comic news website &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; announced that the first 16 issues of &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; would be packaged together and published in an omnibus by Joe Books. On his Tumblr account, Silvani stated that the omnibus would be a remastered edition, featuring revised art, a new epilogue, and that the script had been &quot;painstakingly rewritten&quot; by Sparrow. It was also announced that the omnibus would lead into a new monthly series written by Sparrow and drawn by Silvani, with no involvement by Brill. The omnibus only collects the first 16 issues and the annual, omitting the final &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot; crossover with &quot;DuckTales&quot;, seeming to further call into question Brill&#x27;s claims of sole authorship.

On January 18, 2016, Joe Books Twitter feed reported that &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; would be returning to monthly comics beginning in April 2016 with Sparrow and Silvani at the helm.

According to Silvani&#x27;s Twitter account, &quot;Dangerous Currency&quot; has been declared non-canon by Disney, and will not be referenced within the new series.

====Dynamite Entertainment====
A new comic book series based on the show, which is written by Amanda Deibert and illustrated by Carlo Cid Lauro instead of the team from the previous comic, began publication at Dynamite Entertainment in January 2023. In addition, Dynamite will re-release the original 1991 comic book run.

Dynamite Entertainment revealed a new comic series in June 2023 featuring Negaduck would be released in September written by Jeff Parker and illustrated by Ciro Cangialosi.

Dynamite Entertainment announced another comic series in September 2023 featuring the Justice Ducks would be released in December written by Roger Langridge and illustrated by Carlo Lauro.

Dynamite Entertainment started a kickstarter in June 2024 with the goal of 25k, easily reaching the goal and surpassing it within minutes. Reaching 100k pledges before the night was over. Selling three omnibuses&#x27;s featuring the classic Darkwing Duck Comics along with their &#x27;The Justice Ducks&#x27; and Negaduck&#x27;s comics under Heroes and Villains, Cowl and Fowl, and Darkly Dawns the Duck. By July 3 with the kickstarter concluded, they had 344k pledged. One reward in the 150k stretch goal for backers was a limited edition cover drawn by Tad Stones for a upcoming Darkwing Duck series scheduled for the fall of 2024.

Dynamite Entertainment announced November 22, a new run of the Darkwing Duck comic would start February 2025. The first issue would start with a Darkwing Duck cover drawn by Tad Stones, followed by being written by Daniel Kibblesmith and drawn by Ted Brandt and Ro Stein.

===Cameos on other television series===
* &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992–1993): Quackerjack makes a cameo on Max&#x27;s watch in the episode &quot;Axed by Addition&quot;. In some episodes, Darkwing Duck makes a cameo on the comics and on TV.
* &quot;Raw Toonage&quot; (1992): Gosalyn made a guest appearance.
* &quot;Bonkers&quot; (1993–1994): In a dream sequence, Bonkers accepts an award for best cartoon crime-fighter from Darkwing, who is jealous he did not win it himself. Darkwing later makes three more cameos in three other &quot;Bonkers&quot; episodes.
* &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1994–1995): In the episode &quot;My Fair Aladdin&quot;, the Genie transformed into Darkwing Duck.
* &quot;Quack Pack&quot; (1996):
* &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (2011): In the episode &quot;Kramer vs. Showgirls&quot;, a &quot;Where Are They Now&quot; segment revolves around cartoon characters from the 1990s, including Darkwing Duck. Launchpad was killed in a mishap with US Airways Flight 1549 and when Gosalyn needed a kidney transplant, Darkwing donated his body to a Chinese restaurant where he was cooked alive.
* &quot;Funny or Die&quot; had an April Fool&#x27;s sketch in 2013 where lead voice actor Jim Cummings tried to crowdfund a &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; animated film created all by himself.

====&quot;DuckTales&quot;====
In the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; plays a major recurring role. At first, it appeared as an old television show which Launchpad McQuack is a fan of. The show itself first appears in the episode &quot;Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!&quot;, which depicts Darkwing fighting Quackerjack, the Liquidator, and Megavolt. While watching the episode, Launchpad states that the actor portraying Darkwing is &quot;an old school actor who did all his own stunts&quot; named Jim Starling – a spoof of his voice actor, Jim Cummings; who reprises his role as the character alongside Michael Bell as Quackerjack. Other references include St. Canard&#x27;s name being stated in the premiere episode and the name of the evil organization F.O.W.L. appearing as Easter eggs. Additionally, both F.O.W.L. and S.H.U.S.H. appeared in &quot;From the Confidential Case Files of Agent 22!&quot; The end-credits theme of &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; appears in &quot;The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!&quot; as part of the show-within-a-show. In &quot;Friendship Hates Magic&quot;, Launchpad and Mrs. Beakley watch a &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode based on an actual episode, &quot;The Haunting of Mr. Banana Brain&quot;, featuring Paddywhack.

Darkwing&#x27;s first major role is in &quot;The Duck Knight Returns&quot;, with Drake Mallard (Chris Diamantopoulos) replacing Jim Starling as Darkwing in a movie produced by Scrooge McDuck. After an insane Starling&#x27;s attempt to kill Mallard results in the set&#x27;s explosion and the former&#x27;s presumed death, the movie is canceled. However, Launchpad convinces Drake to become a real superhero, while Starling, having secretly survived the explosion, becomes Negaduck. Drake later reappears in &quot;Moonvasion!&quot; to help thwart the Moonlanders, and at the end of the episode, F.O.W.L. plots to eliminate Scrooge and his family following the trouble they essentially caused; with Steelbeak (Jason Mantzoukas) among their ranks. Darkwing features prominently in the two-part episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Dangerous!&quot;, which introduces new incarnations of Gosalyn (Stephanie Beatriz) and Taurus Bulba (James Monroe Iglehart). In the series finale &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot; Drake and Gosalyn attend Webby Vanderquack&#x27;s birthday party before assisting the Duck family in their final battle against F.O.W.L., during which the pair battle Steelbeak.

===Films===
Darkwing makes a cameo at the end of &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, with Cummings reprising his role. He appears during a mid-credits scene, annoyed at the Rescue Rangers&#x27; newly regained fame and trying to attract attention to himself.

==Reboot==
On April 2, 2015, a rumor surfaced that Disney would be rebooting the series for a 2018 premiere on Disney XD. The report was debunked as an April Fools&#x27; prank. Instead, Darkwing Duck returned as a comic book published by Joe Books, which was released on April 27, 2016.

A &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; reboot is in development for Disney+. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg will executive produce the project via Point Grey Pictures. Tad Stones revealed that he is involved in the reboot series as a creative consultant. While Disney TVA employee Ben Siemon claimed in 2022 that it had been cancelled, Stones clarified in July 2024 that the reboot is still in development, albeit with the original writer&#x27;s room having been disbanded a month prior.

<doc id="93997" wikidata="Q2545812" url="?curid=93997" title="Feltham">
<text>Feltham () is a town in West London, England, from Charing Cross. Historically part of Middlesex, it became part of the London Borough of Hounslow in 1965. The parliamentary constituency of Feltham and Heston has been held by Labour Party MPs since 1992. In 2011, the population of the combined census area of Feltham, Bedfont and Hanworth was 63,368.

The economy of the town was largely agrarian until the early twentieth century, when it was transformed by the expansion of the London urban area. Most of the original High Street was demolished in the 1960s and 1970s. Further redevelopment in the early 2000s created the current shopping centre, which opened in 2006.

Heathrow Airport is to the north west of the town and is a major centre of employment for local residents. Feltham railway station is on the Waterloo to Reading line, between Twickenham and Staines-upon-Thames.

==History==
Feltham formed an ancient parish in the Spelthorne hundred of Middlesex. The Domesday Book records 21 households and an annual value of six pounds sterling; it was held as lord and tenant-in-chief by Robert, Count of Mortain. A large area of ten cultivated ploughlands is recorded. Following Mortain&#x27;s son&#x27;s forfeit of lands (William&#x27;s rebellion triggering the attainder), the land was granted to the Redvers/de Ripariis/Rivers family. The heir in that family, Hubert de Burgh (&#x27;Chief Justiciar and Earl of Kent&#x27;) swapped Feltham and Kempton with Henry III for his manors of Aylsham in Norfolk and Westhall in Suffolk. In 1440 Henry VI granted numerous privileges to his joint royal custodian of the two manors, including a daily income of up to 12 shillings and that &quot;corn, hay, horse and carriages and other goods and chattels should not be seized for the king&#x27;s use&quot;.

While under total royal control following Henry VIII&#x27;s full annexation of the manor into the Honour of Hampton Court, a lease of all of its manor court rights and &quot;franchises, privileges, emoluments, and hereditaments&quot; was granted under his daughter Elizabeth I to the Killigrew family of Kempton Park, for 80 years.

However the large manor itself passed 40 years later in 1631 by grant to Francis (Lord) Cottington, established at his new Hanworth Park, who had become Lord Treasurer, ambassador and leader of the pro-Spanish, pro-Roman Catholic faction in the court of Charles I. His nephew sold it, after a major fire and a very temporary loss caused by John Bradshaw, who arranged the King&#x27;s execution, under the Commonwealth of England, to Sir Thomas Chambers. His son inherited Feltham manor, whose daughter by an empowering marriage to Admiral Vere (created Lord Vere) of Hanworth in the same historic county of Middlesex (created for him 1750) led to its next owner having a very high title and degree of wealth: her son, Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans inherited the manor and a dukedom with considerable land from a cousin. The Duke was a British landowner and a collector of antiquities and works of art, seated occasionally at Hanworth, who funded an excavation in Italy which produced many sculpture artifacts. Parting with much of the Duke&#x27;s surfeit of large country houses, minor plot sales dividing the two ancient manors took place in the 19th century. Finally in the early 20th century, until death, the land now considered Feltham was either already subdivided by developers and farmers or owned by senior judge Ernest Pollock turned politician, (1st) Viscount Hanworth. He saw the very large Hanworth manor, which covered most of Hanworth parish divided up due to taxation; it became well-placed to cater to the demand for new homes with new intra-Borough transport links.

In this period in 1784 General William Roy set out the baseline of what would become the Ordnance Survey across Hounslow Heath, passing through Feltham. General Roy is commemorated by a local pub. The MOD Defence Geographic Centre maintains a base in Feltham, announced for disposal in the 2015–2020 Parliament.

In 1831, Feltham occupied an area of , stretching into Hounslow Heath and had a population of 924. The Waterloo to Reading Line established a station here from its construction in 1848. From 1894 to 1904 the Felham parish was included in the Staines Rural District. In 1901 the parish had a population of 4,534 and accordingly in 1904 it was split from the rural district to form the Feltham Urban District. In 1932 the parishes of Hanworth and East Bedfont were also transferred from the Staines district to Feltham Urban District.
From the 1860s until late 1920s Feltham was also home to the &quot;Cabbage King&quot;, A.W. Smith. Smith was considered one of the most successful market gardeners of the time, and his &quot;Glass City&quot; of greenhouses along Feltham&#x27;s High street was unmatched. Smith also lived in the Feltham House (now in the middle of MOD site in the town) for a time. His greenhouses have since disappeared, but many of the fields still remain.

Feltham Urban District was disbanded in 1965 along with the Middlesex County Council following the London Government Act 1963, which transferred administrative control over parts of Middlesex to the new county of Greater London.

Although opened in 1910, major expansion took place in a similar period, at the extreme south-west of the post town, at Feltham Young Offenders&#x27; Institution or HM Prison Feltham, which is a major such institution providing a range of employments and rehabilitation schemes for young people. It has a border with Ashford and the neighbouring village of East Bedfont.

Famous former resident Freddie Mercury (born Farokh Bulsara in Zanzibar, 1946–1991) of rock band Queen was commemorated by a permanent, Hollywood-style granite star in Feltham&#x27;s town-centre piazza, unveiled on 24 November 2009 (the eighteenth anniversary of Mercury&#x27;s death) by Queen guitarist Brian May, alongside Freddie&#x27;s mother, Jer Bulsara, and his sister. In 2011, owing to neglect and weather damage, Hounslow Council removed the memorial, resolving to substitute a smaller one elsewhere.

===Recent developments===

Feltham&#x27;s town centre developed in the period 1860–2010 when the focus of the village moved north from by St Dunstan&#x27;s Church after the coming of the railway in 1848. For most of the twentieth century, it had a traditional-looking High Street, including more mock tudor shop fronts, and a large medieval manor house which was controversially demolished in the mid-1960s to make way for a car dealership and petrol station. This has since been demolished but replaced with a hardware, carpets and supermarket site &quot;Manor Park&quot;.

Most of the original High Street shops were also demolished in the mid-1960s through to the early 1970s. Victorian and Edwardian tall-storey terraced, semi-detached and detached homes are found on Hanworth Road and adjoining roads, and in the small conservation area at Feltham Pond on the High Street. Many old cottages and workman&#x27;s terraces were demolished alongside the railway line to make way for brutalist high rise blocks of housing, of originally purely social housing to house the homeless and overcrowded people in the borough, such as Belvedere House, Hunter House and Home Court, demolished in the 2000s and replaced with mixed-ownership apartments in a more ornate style in a cluster, incorporating designer balconies and architectural demonstrations of free-form structure such as propped overhangs and an unobtrusive at street-level, multi-faceted floor plan.

The current shopping hub, The centre, Feltham (also known as the Longford Centre, if only by the original developers and some retail tenants), opened in 2006. It retained and refurbished many of the shop units built in the 1960s to replace the demolished buildings, along the High Street frontage, but replaced most of the others with new, larger units. Also added as part of the re-development was a Travelodge hotel, 800 homes, a new and larger library, and a medical centre. The anchor (and largest) store in the centre is an Asda hypermarket, coupled with fashion chains, small restaurants, a public house and cafés. Near to the retail park mentioned is a Tesco superstore and numerous grocery outlets are dotted along the area&#x27;s High Street. Added to this are regular local trades/services in small clusters in the main named neighbourhoods of North Feltham and Lower Feltham. Prior to this large-scale redevelopment, the rock band Oasis filmed the video for their song &quot;Stand by Me&quot; in The Centre in 1997. Rap group So Solid Crew also filmed the music video for their 2003 single, &quot;Broke Silence&quot;, on Highfield Estate (nearby The ), before its eventual regeneration.

In retail, the closest destination with more than 100 outlets is Hounslow, centred less than to the north-east, followed by Kingston and Staines. Late 2017 saw the approval of the &quot;Feltham Masterplan&quot; by Hounslow council which will see the transformation of Feltham for the next 15 years.

In June 2024 a Surrey Police officer, who repeatedly drove his police car into a 10-month-old breeding heifer, called Beau Lucy, in Raleigh Road, was removed from frontline duties.

==Geography==

Feltham is centred west south west of central London at Charing Cross and centred from the centre of Heathrow Airport.

The neighbouring settlements are Hounslow, Ashford, East Bedfont (including Hatton), Sunbury Common, Cranford and Hanworth.

==Governance==
There is no specific town council for Feltham; instead a Bedfont, Feltham, Hanworth area forum of councillors considers issues specific to the area on the London Borough of Hounslow&#x27;s council.

The town forms part of Feltham and Heston parliamentary constituency (and the South West London Assembly constituency which elects the geographic element of members who advise, steer, assist and scrutinise the Mayor of London who is directly responsible for only certain designated policy areas such as Transport for London). There are two local government wards falling entirely within Feltham – Feltham North and Feltham West – though locals often consider sections of the Hanworth Park and Bedfont wards as forming part of Feltham. This area was represented in Parliament from 1992 to 2011 by Alan Keen (Labour). After his death, Labour candidate Seema Malhotra won the by-election.

Feltham Magistrates&#x27; Court was built in 1902 as a town hall but converted to a magistrates&#x27; court in 1906. The court closed in 2016.
Immediately adjacent to the town centre is MoD Feltham, a secure site belonging to the Ministry of Defence.

==Economy==

The main economic activity of the Feltham area was market gardening until well into the twentieth century. A popular variety of pea known as the Feltham First is so-named for being first grown in the town. The market gardens were largely replaced with light industry, gravel and aggregate extraction, and new housing from the 1930s onwards.

Feltham has been associated with land and air transport for more than a century. In what is now the Leisure West entertainment complex of various buildings including cinema, bowling alley and restaurants, the Feltham tramcar was once manufactured and ran along the tracks of many municipal operators, though never in Feltham itself. In the same area of the town, aircraft manufacture was an important industry, particularly in the war years. Feltham was in the early and mid 20th century home to Britain&#x27;s second largest railway marshalling yard which was geared towards freight, and was a target for German air force bombs in World War II.

The motor car manufacturer Aston Martin had its main factory in Feltham between 1926 (when it bought the former Whitehead Aircraft factory) and 1963. The site is now occupied by part of Leisure West.

A former company based in Feltham from 1911 until the closure of its factory in the 1980s was Minimax Limited, manufacturers of fire extinguishers.

The largest local employer is Heathrow Airport. Associated businesses conglomerate in the business parks of the TW14 (Bedfont and Feltham North) part of the post town particularly in logistics and couriers who store and carry the air freight of much of Britain.

However, accessibility of parts of Central London and a good local road network have also made Feltham a base for a number of high-tech companies, including DHL and Arqiva. The latter is notable in having a telecommunications port (teleport) in Feltham which provides transmission and distribution facilities for TV companies including Sky and Channel 5.

==Leisure==
Feltham has in its land use considerably more open spaces than average in (Greater) London; bounding it to the east is a natural small river, the Crane separating off the once vast Hounslow Heath to the east, stretching from north by Harlington south to Hampton, London until the early 20th century. To other sides it includes a country park formed from converted gravel pits (Bedfont Lakes) with rolling adjacent meadows open to walkers by its railway and (within the post town) one of Greater London&#x27;s first airfields, London Air Park at Hanworth, which has well-trimmed grass, is surrounded by trees and is a large and sports-oriented public open space.

Public venues include Feltham Assembly Hall, opened in 1965 in Feltham Park, community rooms in the new library, as well as several residents association halls and clubs. Since the controversial removal in 2008 of the Feltham Community Association from the Feltham People&#x27;s Centre (the former Feltham Hotel), the town has lacked a dedicated community centre and after protests from the community a new one I now being built on Feltham Green with a planned opening date of spring 2025

Springwest Academy (formerly Feltham Comprehensive School) and Rivers Academy West London (known as Longford School until 2011) both have excellent sports facilities. These supplement the Hanworth Air Park Leisure Centre and Library, operated by Fusion Leisure on behalf of Hounslow Council. Leisure West (a privately developed and managed complex of entertainment and dining facilities including a multiplex cinema, tenpin bowling alley, bingo club and restaurants) opened on the former industrial sites around Browell&#x27;s Lane in the mid-1990s.
Feltham has a Non-League football club Bedfont &amp; Feltham F.C. who play at the Orchard in East Bedfont. Bedfont Recreation Ground hosts Brentford Women.

==Demography==
The 2011 ethnic groups in Feltham with a total population of 63,368 were:
*51.4% White British
*20.2% Asian
*10.1% Other White (not covering Irish or Traveller)
*9.6% Black

This is combined data for the Feltham North and West wards with Feltham North being slightly more ethnically diverse than Feltham West.

==Religion==
The town remains among the largest ecclesiastical parishes of the Diocese of London within the Church of England. The parish church of St Dunstan and the Parish of Feltham have joined with two other churches to create a larger Ecumenical Parish of Feltham founded in the late 1970s. This joins the church together in activities and church services with Southville Methodist Church and the United Free Church of Feltham.

On 24 June 1868, Father Ignatius founded an Anglican Benedictine convent in the parish. Feltham Priory, or Feltham Nunnery, was dedicated to Saints Mary and Scholastica (twin sister of St Benedict). It lasted five years before the nuns initiated a series of moves which would see them relocate to Curzon Park Abbey in Chester in 1988.

The tall spire fronting tower of an additional church first built 1880–1898, to St Catherine, opposite the railway station forms the façade of St Catherine&#x27;s House, a London Borough of Hounslow Housing office and temporary housing accommodation.
As of August 2014, St Catherine&#x27;s House is now closed because the council have moved out and relocated elsewhere.

The Roman Catholic church of Saint Lawrence, with its attendant primary school, faces onto Feltham Green.

==Transport==
===Tube===
Nearby Hatton Cross, which is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line provides a Central London and Heathrow rail option to Feltham, and is north of the town centre. Bus routes 90, 117, 235, 285, 490, H25 and H26 also run frequent services through the town, as well as bus route 116 through Feltham North.

===Railway===
The town is served by Feltham railway station on the Waterloo to Reading Line, Two branch line services operate on the line here, to Windsor and Weybridge.

===Bus and coach services===
The town has London Buses services to Kingston upon Thames, Richmond, Brentford, Heathrow, Staines-upon-Thames, Northolt, Isleworth and Sunbury on Thames. Intervening places such as Hayes, Hounslow, Hampton Court/Hampton, Twickenham and Ashford are called at.

Long-distance express services are offered predominantly from various sides of Heathrow to places such as Slough, Reading, Berkshire and Croydon, the latter under the London Buses pricing and operational scheme.

<text>Finchley () is a large district of north London, England, in the London Borough of Barnet. north of Charing Cross, nearby districts include: Golders Green, Muswell Hill, Friern Barnet, Whetstone, Mill Hill and Hendon.

It is predominantly a residential suburb, with three town centres: North Finchley, East Finchley and Finchley Church End (Finchley Central). Made up of four wards, the population of Finchley was 65,812 as of 2011.

== History ==
Finchley probably means &quot;Finch&#x27;s clearing&quot; or &quot;finches&#x27; clearing&quot; in late Anglo-Saxon; the name was first recorded in the early 13th century. Finchley is not recorded in Domesday Book, but by the 11th century its lands were held by the Bishop of London. In the early medieval period the area was sparsely populated woodland, whose inhabitants supplied pigs and fuel to London.

Extensive cultivation began about the time of the Norman conquest. By the 15th and 16th centuries the woods on the eastern side of the parish had been cleared to form Finchley Common. The medieval Great North Road, which ran through the common, was notorious for highwaymen until the early 19th century.

St Mary-at-Finchley Church is first recorded in the 1270s. Near the northern gate to the Bishop of London&#x27;s park, the hamlet of East End, later East Finchley, had begun to develop by 1365. By the 18th century Finchley was well known for the quality of its hay, which was the dominant agricultural activity until the second half of the 19th century. North Finchley only began to develop after the enclosure of the common during the 1820s.

It formed an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex, originally within the hundred of Ossulstone and later becoming its own urban district, which was then incorporated as a municipal borough in 1933. It has been part of Greater London since 1965.

The Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (later the Great Northern Railway) reached Finchley in 1867. It ran from Finsbury Park via Finchley to Edgware. The branch from Finchley to High Barnet opened in 1872. In 1905 tram services were established in Finchley, and extended shortly afterwards to Barnet. They were eventually replaced by trolleybuses.

In 1933, the Underground New Works Programme (1935–1940), to electrify the lines through Finchley, and connect the Northern line from Archway to East Finchley, via a new tunnel was announced. Much of the work was carried out and East Finchley station was rebuilt, but the project was halted by the second world war. All passenger services from Finchley to Edgware ended in September 1939. Nevertheless, Underground trains began running from central London to High Barnet in 1940, and to Mill Hill East, to reach the army barracks, in 1941.

After the war, the introduction of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Green Belt undermined pre-war plans and the upgrading between Mill Hill East and Edgware (the &#x27;Northern Heights&#x27; project) was abandoned, although the line continued to be used by steam trains for goods traffic through Finchley, until 1964.

==Governance==

From around 1547 Finchley had a parish vestry, which became a local board in 1878, an urban district council in 1895, and finally a municipal borough council between 1933 and 1965. The area is now part of the London Borough of Barnet.

From 1959 to 1992 the Finchley constituency was represented in Parliament by Margaret Thatcher, UK Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. Finchley is now included in the new constituency of Finchley and Golders Green.

In February 2010, the Green Party held its spring party conference at the artsdepot in North Finchley.

==Geography==
Finchley is on a plateau, 90 metres (300 ft) above sea level north of Charing Cross and south of Barnet. To the west is the Dollis valley formed by Dollis Brook the natural western boundary of Finchley. Mutton Brook forms the southern boundary, joining the Dollis Brook to become the River Brent.

Most of Finchley is on boulder clay or glacial moraine, skirted by a layer of gravel, then the underlying layer of London clay. This roughly triangular gravel line was the most fertile area; hamlets which grew at the three corners evolved into Finchley&#x27;s early population centres corresponding to the three town centres in the area:
* Church End, often known as &quot;Finchley Central&quot; (particularly since the station was renamed), the area north and west of the North Circular Road, centred on Ballards Lane and Finchley Central Underground station, and in postal area N3;
* East Finchley, roughly between Highgate and the North Circular Road, and in postal area N2;
* North Finchley, surrounding Tally-Ho corner, stretching west to the Northern line, in postcode district N12.

The residential areas of West Finchley, in postcode district N3, and Woodside Park, in postcode district N12, centre on their respective tube stations to the west of the area. Between East Finchley and Finchley Central is Long Lane, which runs parallel to the tube line and is dotted with small shopping parades.

The area of London known as &#x27;Finchley Road&#x27;, around Finchley Road Underground station, is not part of Finchley, but instead refers to a district further south at Swiss Cottage, Camden. The area is named after a section of the A41 road, which runs north to Golders Green and eventually continues to Henlys Corner on the North Circular Road and on to Finchley.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 UK Census in Finchley Church End ward, 67% of the population was White (47% British, 18% Other, 2% Irish), 8% South Asian and 6% Other Asian. The largest religion was Judaism, claimed by 31% of the population, whereas Christians made up 28%. West Finchley ward was 61% White (40% British, 18% Other, 3% Irish), 13% South Asian and 8% Other Asian.

<text>Aaron &quot;The A-Train&quot; Smith (born September 3, 1950) is a Nashville-based drummer and percussionist who has played as a member of multiple bands, and as a studio musician, starting in 1970. Smith played drums on several hit Motown recordings in the 1970s, including The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;. In the 1980s, he was a member of the new wave band Romeo Void and the Christian alternative rock band the 77s.

== History ==

With a singular focus, Aaron Smith began his career playing drums in marching band during the sixth grade practicing on the cafeteria tables since there were so many kids wanting to play that instrument. Smith has stated that his influences include James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Stax, RCA, Motown, Ringo Starr and the Beatles&#x27; appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. On his first recording session for the song &quot;Push, Push&quot;, Smith was paid with &quot;all the hamburgers he could eat&quot;.

At the age of 20, Smith played drums on The Temptations&#x27; recording of &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song also won two Grammy Awards at the 15th Annual Awards ceremony - one for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group Or Chorus and the other for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance. Although not formally a member of the Funk Brothers, he performed with them on several Motown albums as a part of the rhythm section. These records include &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (Temptations 71), &quot;Solid Rock&quot; (Temptations 71), &quot;All Directions&quot; (Temptations 72), &quot;Face to Face with the Truth&quot; (The Undisputed Truth 72), &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (73), &quot;The Temptations in Japan&quot; (Temptations 73), &quot;Keep on Trucking&quot; (Eddie Kendricks 73), &quot;Me and Rock and Roll Are Here to Stay&quot; (David Ruffin 74). He has also worked on &quot;Renaissance&quot; (Ray Charles 76), &quot;Prime Time&quot; (Grey And Hanks 80), &quot;A Girl In Trouble&quot; (Romeo Void 84). Smith was also a member of the progressive rock group Vector from 1983 through 1985.

In 1984, he joined the new wave group Romeo Void. Although his stint in the band was relatively brief (with the band breaking up the following year), he did perform on their most commercially successful single, &quot;A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)&quot; (along with the rest of the tracks on the accompanying &quot;Instincts&quot; album) and was even interviewed and invited back to perform with the group for their &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; episode. Also in 1984, Smith contributed to the 77s&#x27; album &quot;All Fall Down&quot;. He later joined the group officially in 1987, taking part in their albums &quot;The 77s&quot; (1987), &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; (1990), &quot;Eighty Eight&quot; (1991), &quot;The Seventy Sevens&quot; (also known as Pray Naked - 1992), and &quot;Drowning with Land in Sight&quot; (1994) leaving the group in 1995.

Smith has also appeared on the following recordings: &quot;Simple House&quot; (Margaret Becker, 1991), &quot;Love Life&quot; (Charlie Peacock, 1991), &quot;Listen&quot; (Cindy Morgan, 1996), &quot;The Loving Kind&quot; (Cindy Morgan, 1998), &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; (Rich Mullins, 1995), &quot;Hope Is Born Again&quot; (Jim Brickman/Point of Grace, 1997), &quot;The Jesus Record&quot; (Rich Mullins, 1998), &quot;Prayers of a Ragamuffin&quot; (A Ragamuffin Band, 2000), &quot;A Long Way Back&quot; (Kim Richey, 2020) and many more.

In his career, Smith has done many live tours as well with artists he has recorded with: Chuck Jackson, The Undisputed Truth, The Temptations, Mirosla Vitous, Club Nouveau, Miroslav Vitous, The 77&#x27;s, Michael Card, Engelbert Humperdinck, Michael W. Smith, Charlie Peacock, Rich Mullins and Kevin Max.

An autographed pair of Smith&#x27;s drumsticks, part of the Peter Lavinger collection which was on display in the Main Exhibition Level through Feb. 2002 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, can be found next to a pair of sticks used by Ringo Starr, one of his early influences.

<doc id="94006" wikidata="Q1817328" url="?curid=94006" title="Finsbury">
<text>Finsbury is a district of Central London, forming the southeastern part of the London Borough of Islington. It borders the City of London.

The Manor of Finsbury is first recorded as &quot;Vinisbir&quot; (1231) and means &quot;manor of a man called Finn&quot;. Finsbury lay just outside Cripplegate (and on its later construction, Moorgate) in London Wall. At that time, much of the manor was part of the &quot;great fen which washed against the northern wall of the City&quot;.
Finsbury gave its name to two larger administrative areas: the Finsbury Division of the Ossulstone Hundred of Middlesex, from the 17th century until 1900, and from 1900 to 1965 the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. The Metropolitan Borough included Finsbury (also known as St Luke&#x27;s) and Clerkenwell.

The area should not be confused with Finsbury Park, a public space roughly to the north, which gives its name to its surrounding mainly residential area.

==Geography==
The area lies immediately north of the City of London, and approximates to the part of the London Borough of Islington east of Goswell Road and south of City Road. It also includes a small area north of City Road, focused on the City Road Basin.

The parts of the City of London&#x27;s Coleman Street Ward that lie outside the line of the former City walls (now mostly covered by Finsbury Circus) were historically part of the Manor of Finsbury and still sometimes described as part of the area.

Finsbury Town Hall and the Finsbury Estate lie further west, in Clerkenwell and are named after the former borough of Finsbury which included both Finsbury and Clerkenwell.

==Origins and administration==
===Soke of Cripplegate===
The Soke of Cripplegate was a landholding outside Cripplegate and Aldersgate. Bordered (in part at least) by the Walbrook to the east, it covered the areas subsequently known as Aldersgate Without and the parish of St Giles-without-Cripplegate (which included Cripplegate Without, the part of Coleman Street Ward north of the wall and the Manor of Finsbury).

The Soke was granted to St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand by William the Conqueror in 1068, in exchange for prayers for the souls of his parents. It is thought the estate may be much older dating back to the establishment of the Diocese of London in the 7th century.
The churches of St Botolph without Aldersgate and St Giles-without-Cripplegate appear to have been built in the early decades of the twelfth century (possibly under the aegis of Matilda of Blessed Memory) and there was very little, if any, development north of the wall before that time. St Martins rights to the Soke were confirmed by the Empress Matilda (daughter of Matilda of Blessed Memory) around 1140. St Martins was permitted to enclose land there to prevent rubbish dumping in the area, but it is thought the Empress&#x27; principle intention was to promote planned development of a northern suburb.

The development of streets such as Redcross Street, Whitecross Street, Grub Street, Fore Street, Moor Lane, Chiswell Street and others were subsequently recorded.

===Manor and parishes===
It is not entirely clear how the territory and rights of the Soke evolved into the subsequent administrative and ecclesiastical units.

The area covered by the Soke was served by two parishes; the little parish of St Botolph without Aldersgate served the extramural City Ward of Aldersgate Without, while the parish of St Giles-without-Cripplegate served the extramural City Ward of Cripplegate Without and the Manor (estate) of Finsbury. In the 17th century, Little and Lower Moorfields, previously in the Manor of Finsbury and Parish of St Giles, was transferred to the Coleman Street Ward of the City of London (and also to the parish of St Stephen Coleman Street for religious purposes). This meant that Coleman Street Ward also possessed an extramural area.

From mid-12th century the Manor of Finsbury was owned by St Paul&#x27;s cathedral and managed as a Prebendary Manor to provide a prebend (a stipend of money or goods) to support an ecclesiastic person such as a canon, or an institution. For a long time the prebendary income went to Holywell Priory in nearby Shoreditch, so the estate became known as the &quot;Prebend of Halliwell and Finsbury&quot;, though the Priory itself did not lie adjacent to the prebendary manor or form part of it.

The prebendary manor of Finsbury was, from 1315, leased by the Lord Mayor of London, so that after that the formal title of the Mayors has been &quot;Mayor of London and Lord of Finsbury&quot;. The mayoral manor house, &quot;Finsbury Court&quot;, lay on the junction of Chiswell Street and Finsbury Pavement.
In this way the part of St Giles parish, &quot;Cripplegate Without&quot;, that was part of the city was also known as &quot;The Freedom&quot; and governed by the Mayor as a part of, or a dependency of the city. The remaining part, &quot;The Manor of Finsbury&quot;, was also known as &quot;The Lordship&quot;, where the Mayor&#x27;s position was that of a lessee, albeit with the title &quot;Lord of the Manor of Finsbury&quot;.

Other accounts suggest the Manor passed to the Lord Mayors later, being made over their use by Richard II, in gratitude for the killing of Wat Tyler by Mayor William Walworth at Smithfield in 1381.

In 1733, the growth of the local population, led to the part of St Giles-without-Cripplegate outside the city, the area which had been the Manor of Finsbury, being made an independent parish, known as &quot;St Luke&#x27;s&quot;, after the parish church.

===Latter administration and representation===
The parts of the parish of St Giles outside of the city (originally the Manor of Finsbury, later organised as the Parish of St Luke) were part of the Hundred of Ossulstone in Middlesex. By the 17th century, population growth made this unit inefficient, so it was sub-divided with the area north of the walls becoming part of a new Finsbury Division which handled the responsibilities previously managed by the Hundred. Parish-level institutions continued to manage the Poor Law and ecclesiastical matters.

In 1832 the parliamentary borough of Finsbury was created to represent the area in parliament. This area loosely approximated to the Finsbury division, but also included parts of west London. In 1857 Finsbury Park was opened some three miles north, for the enjoyment of the residents of this parliamentary borough.
The Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury in the County of London was created in 1900, covering the area of Finsbury (also known as St Luke&#x27;s) and Clerkenwell, with Finsbury Town Hall located on Rosebery Avenue, Clerkenwell. In 1938, Dr. Chuni Lal Katial was elected mayor of Finsbury, making him the first Asian mayor in the United Kingdom.

The Borough&#x27;s coat of arms included an embattled chief (top of the shield) representing the London Wall, a Barbican representing the three northern gates (Aldersgate, Cripplegate and Moorgate) and a Winged Bull, the heraldic symbol of St Luke.

In 1965 the area merged with Islington to form the new London Borough of Islington, though Finsbury Circus remains part of the City of London.

==History==
===Growth===
Urbanisation was slow, despite the building of a new gate in the adjacent London Wall, Moorgate, in 1511. In 1665 the Bunhill Fields burial ground was opened in the area.
Building on Finsbury Fields began in the late 17th century. The parish church of St Luke&#x27;s was built in 1732–33, development was accelerated by the building of the City Road in 1765, and at the end of the 18th century a residential suburb was built with its centre at Finsbury Square. Little and Lower Moorfields remained open until Finsbury Circus was developed after 1815.

===Military history===

In 1641 the Honourable Artillery Company moved to Finsbury, where it still remains. The City of London Yeomanry, founded at the time of the Second Boer War, made its headquarters in Finsbury Square.

In 1862 Finsbury gave its name to a volunteer infantry unit — the Finsbury Rifles, which recruited in both Finsbury and Clerkenwell, and saw distinguished service in several conflicts.

===Medical district===
Before Harley Street rose to prominence, Finsbury was London&#x27;s principal medical district. In the mid-19th century it was home to a large number of hospitals, but now only Moorfields Eye Hospital remains.
The area included the following hospitals:
* Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest
* Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (Moorfields)
* St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for Lunatics
* French Huguenot Hospital
* St Mark&#x27;s Hospital for Fistula and other Diseases of the Rectum
* Holborn &amp; Finsbury Poor Law Union
* Bethlem Hospital, on the site of what is now Finsbury Circus

==Famous residents==
* Charles Gordon, cricketer and grandson of the founder of Gordon&#x27;s Gin
* Violet Kray, mother of the gangster Kray brothers. Twins Ronnie and Reggie were arrested at her flat in Braithwaite House, Finsbury, in connection with gangland crimes including murder and fraud on 8 May 1968.
* Eric Maxon, Shakespearean and early film actor, died in Finsbury
* Arthur Mullard, comic actor
* Dadabhai Naoroji, Indian politician

<text>Goddington is an area in south-east London, located in the London Borough of Bromley. It is situated south of Ramsden, south-east of Orpington town centre, and north of Chelsfield. It lies directly adjacent to the London Green Belt. Until 1965 it lay in the historic county of Kent.

==History==
Goddington was historically a rural manor, first recorded in the 1200s as being the lands held by Simon de Godyngton, which in turn refers to his family&#x27;s ancestral lands in Godinton, Kent. The area only began to be developed in 1926 when housing was built along Park Avenue. The area was subsequently developed further, and in 1965 it became part of the London Borough of Bromley in the newly formed ceremonial county of Greater London.

==Amenities==
Goddington Park is 64 hectares in size, with five football pitches, two cricket squares, and three rugby pitches. It includes an astro-turf football court, about 10 tennis courts and two children&#x27;s play areas. The main entrance is from Goddington Lane, with footpaths from Avalon Road, Court Road and Chelsfield Lane and a further entrance from Berrylands.

St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School, built 1968, is located on Goddington Lane.

==Sports==
* Westcombe Park Rugby Club (located here since 1990).

<text>The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames is a borough in southwest London. The main town is Kingston upon Thames and it includes Chessington, Malden Rushett, New Malden, Surbiton and Tolworth. It is the oldest of the four royal boroughs in England. The others are Windsor and Maidenhead, the site of Windsor Castle, and the London boroughs of Greenwich, and Kensington and Chelsea. The local authority is Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council.

The neighbouring districts (clockwise from north) are the London boroughs of Richmond upon Thames, Wandsworth, Merton and Sutton, and the Surrey districts of Epsom and Ewell, Mole Valley and Elmbridge.

==History==
Kingston upon Thames, on the south bank of the River Thames has existed for many hundreds of years. Many Roman relics have been found in the surrounding areas. A church has stood on the site of All Saints&#x27; Church, in the centre of Kingston, for more than a thousand years. An earlier church was sacked by the Vikings in 1009 AD. Kingston was the site of the coronations of seven Anglo-Saxon monarchs:

* Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great, 900AD
* Athelstan, 925AD
* Edmund I, 939AD
* Eadred, 946AD
* Eadwig, 956AD
* Edward the Martyr, 975AD
* Ethelred the Unready, 979AD

The Coronation Stone, on which they are said to have been crowned stands outside the local council offices, the Guildhall. A coin from the reign of each of those kings is set into the base of the stone.
===Administrative history===
The town of Kingston upon Thames was an ancient borough, having been formally incorporated in 1441, with a long history prior to that as a royal manor dating back to Saxon times. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. Kingston was often described as a royal borough, with its right to that title being formally confirmed in 1927.

The old borough did not cover the whole parish of Kingston upon Thames, and separate local government arrangements were later put in place for the outlying parts of the parish. Surbiton was made an improvement commissioners district in 1855, and New Malden was made a local government district in 1866.

Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. New Malden was enlarged in 1895 to take in the neighbouring parishes of Coombe and Malden, at which point the urban district was renamed The Maldens and Coombe. Surbiton was also enlarged in 1895, absorbing the parishes of Hook and Tolworth, and again in 1933 when it absorbed Chessington. Both urban districts were incorporated to become municipal boroughs in 1936, at which point The Maldens and Coombe was renamed Malden and Coombe.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, covering the combined area of the former municipal boroughs of Kingston-upon-Thames, Malden and Coombe and Surbiton. The area was transferred from Surrey to Greater London to become one of the 32 London Boroughs. Kingston&#x27;s royal borough status transferred to the enlarged borough.

Most of the borough continued to have Surrey postal addresses until postal counties were abolished in 1996. Districts mainly use the KT postcode, except from the parts of Ham in the borough which use the TW code, and the Kingston Vale area in the north-east which has an SW15 postcode.

==Districts in the borough==
Areas in the borough include:

* Berrylands
* Canbury
* Chessington
* Coombe
* Hook
* Kingston upon Thames
* Kingston Vale
* Malden Rushett
* Motspur Park
* Worcester Park (partly)
* New Malden
* Norbiton
* Old Malden

==Governance==

The local authority is Kingston Council, which is based at Kingston upon Thames Guildhall.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the South West constituency.

===UK Parliament===
The borough includes the whole of the Kingston and Surbiton Parliamentary Constituency and part of the Richmond Park Constituency with both constituencies being created in 1997. The previous constituencies re-arranged to form these two had been essentially Conservative.

In 1997 the Liberal Democrats won both seats. Jenny Tonge took Richmond Park constituency and in 2005 Susan Kramer became its Liberal Democrat MP with a majority of 3,731 but she was beaten in the May 2010 election by Conservative Zac Goldsmith with a majority of 4,091. Goldsmith retained his seat at the 2015 general election, with a greatly increased majority of 23,015. Goldsmith stood as an Independent candidate in the by-election held on 1 December 2016, but was defeated by Sarah Olney, a Liberal Democrat, after the Conservative Party decided not to put forward its own candidate. Goldsmith regained the seat for the Conservatives in the 2017 general election with a significantly reduced majority of 45 votes. Sarah Olney then regained the seat during the 2019 general election.

In 1997 Ed Davey overturned the previous Conservative majority of more than 10,000 in Kingston and Surbiton, to win by 56 votes after three recounts. He retained the seat in 2001 with a majority of 15,676 over the Conservative candidate David Shaw. In 2005 Davey&#x27;s majority was 8,961, and in the May 2010 general election he again retained the seat with a slightly reduced majority, beating the Conservative candidate Helen Whately. In the 2015 general election, Davey&#x27;s seat was taken by Conservative James Berry with a majority of 2,834. Davey&#x27;s was one of six Liberal Democrat losses in London and 49 overall as the party suffered its worst election results since its formation in 1988. Davey regained the seat in the 2017 general election.

==Transport==
Kingston has nine South Western Railway stations and two centrally located bus stations, but no London Underground or other Transport for London stations. In 2008, 64 bus routes served the Kingston-area.

===Railway===

Coaching interests in Kingston opposed the plan of the London and Southampton Railway to run its line to Southampton near Kingston. The line consequently avoided the town with a station opened in 1838 southwest of the town; it was later resited to the present site of Surbiton station.

In 1863 a branch was built from Twickenham to a terminus in Kingston. That line was extended to the main line in 1869 to form the Kingston Loop Line.

All rail services in the borough are operated by South Western Railway, who provide regular services to and from London Waterloo.

Railway stations in the borough:
*, London Zone 5
*, London Zone 6

==Coat of arms==

The Kingston coat of arms displays three salmon and its shield is almost identical to the coat of arms of the Swedish municipality of Laholm. Both coats of arms can be traced back to the 16th century. The arms of the Norwegian town of Mandal is also similar, but more recent.

In 1966 the newly created London Borough added a set crests and supporters taken from the localities merged into it. The crest came from the Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe, with that borough&#x27;s arms hung from the neck of the stag, and the supporters taken from Municipal Borough of Surbiton, with again its arms hanging from the stags&#x27; necks.
