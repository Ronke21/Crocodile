<text>Hoxton is an area in the London Borough of Hackney, England. It was historically in the county of Middlesex until 1889. Hoxton lies north-east of the City of London and is considered to be a part of London East End and was once part of the civil parish and subsequent Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, prior to its incorporation into Hackney.

The area is generally considered to be bordered by Regent&#x27;s Canal on the north side, Wharf Road and City Road to the west, Old Street to the south, and Kingsland Road to the east.

There is a Hoxton electoral ward which returns three councillors to Hackney London Borough Council. The area forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch parliamentary constituency.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest recorded names of the settlement are Hochestone, in the Domesday Book in 1086, and Hocston, which is mentioned in a fine of 1220-1221. The name is likely to derive from the possessive form of a person&#x27;s name, possibly &quot;Hocg&quot;, and the Old English word &quot;tun&quot;, meaning a fortified enclosure, village, or manor. Little is recorded of the origins of the settlement, though there was Roman activity around Ermine Street, which ran to the east of the area from the first century. In medieval times, Hoxton formed a rural part of Shoreditch parish. It achieved independent ecclesiastical status in 1826 with the founding of its own parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist, though civil jurisdiction was still invested in the Shoreditch vestry. The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers remains Patron of the advowson of the parish of St John&#x27;s.

In 1415, the Lord Mayor of London &quot;caused the wall of the City to be broken towards Moorfields, and built the postern called Moorgate, for the ease of the citizens to walk that way upon causeways towards Islington and Hoxton&quot; – at that time, still marshy areas. The residents responded by harassing walkers to protect their fields. A century later, the hedges and ditches were destroyed, by order of the city, to enable city dwellers to partake in leisure at Hoxton.

===Tudor Hoxton===
By Tudor times many moated manor houses existed to provide ambassadors and courtiers country air nearby the city. This included many Catholics, attracted by the house of the Portuguese Ambassador, who, in his private chapel, celebrated the masses forbidden in a Protestant country. One such resident was Sir Thomas Tresham, who was imprisoned here by Elizabeth I of England for harbouring Catholic priests. The open fields to the north and west were frequently used for archery practice, and on 22 September 1598 the playwright Ben Jonson fought a fatal duel in Hoxton Fields, killing actor Gabriel Spencer. Jonson was able to prove his literacy, thereby claiming benefit of clergy to escape a hanging.

Hoxton&#x27;s public gardens were a popular resort from the overcrowded City streets, and it is reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and his particular brew.

The gardens appear to have been situated near Hoxton Street, known at that time, as &quot;Pimlico Path&quot;. The modern area of Pimlico derives its name from its former use in Hoxton.

===Gunpowder, treason and a letter===

On 26 October 1605 Hoxton achieved notoriety, when a letter arrived at the home of local resident William Parker, Lord Monteagle warning him not to attend the Parliament summoned by James I to convene on 5 November, because &quot;yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow, the Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them&quot;. The letter may have been sent by his brother-in-law Francis Tresham, or he may have written it himself, to curry favour. The letter was read aloud at supper, before prominent Catholics, and then he delivered it personally to Robert Cecil at Whitehall. While the conspirators were alerted, by the public reading, to the existence of the letter they persevered with their plot as their gunpowder remained undiscovered. William Parker accompanied Thomas Howard, the Lord Chamberlain, at his visit to the undercroft of Parliament, where Guy Fawkes was found in the early hours of 5 November. Most of the conspirators fled on the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, but Francis Tresham was arrested a few days later at his house in Hoxton. A commemorative plaque is attached to modern flats at the site of Parker&#x27;s house in Hoxton Street.

===Almshouses and madhouses===

By the end of the 17th century the nobility&#x27;s estates began to be broken up. Many of these large houses came to be used as schools, hospitals or mad houses, with almshouses being built on the land between by benefactors, most of whom were City liverymen. Aske&#x27;s Almshouses were built (to Robert Hooke&#x27;s design) on Pitfield Street in 1689 from Robert Aske&#x27;s endowment for 20 poor haberdashers and a school for 20 children of freemen.

Almshouses endowed by Robert Geffrye were estabslished by the Ironmongers&#x27; Company on the Kingsland Road in 1714. The almshouses closed in 1911, with the remaining pensioners moving to Kent and Hampshire. The LCC took on the almshouses and opened the Geffrye Museum in 1914 to house collections of furniture and wood crafts. Museum of the Home now occupies the site, and following an extensive refurbishment, is a free museum with access directly opposite Hoxton Station.

Hoxton House, was established as a private asylum in 1695. It was owned by the Miles family, and expanded rapidly into the surrounding streets being described by Coleridge as &quot;the&quot; Hoxton madhouse. Here fee-paying &#x27;gentle and middle class&#x27; people took their exercise in the extensive grounds between Pitfield Street and Kingsland Road; including the poet Charles Lamb. Over 500 pauper lunatics resided in closed wards, and it remained the Naval Lunatic Asylum until 1818. The asylum closed in 1911; the only remains are by Hackney Community College, where a part of the house was incorporated into the school that replaced it in 1921.

In the late 17th Century, Hoxton Square and Charles Square were laid out, forming a popular area for residents. Non-conformist sects were attracted to the area, away from the restrictions of the City&#x27;s regulations.

===Victorian era and 20th century===

In the Victorian era the railways made travelling to distant suburbs easier, and this combined with infill building and industrialisation to drive away the wealthier classes, leaving Hoxton a concentration of the poor with many slums. The area became a centre for the furniture trade.

In the 1860s Hoxton Square became home to the Augustinian Priory, school and Church of St Monica (architect: E. W. Pugin) built 1864-66 and the first Augustinian House in England since the Reformation era.

Charles Booth in &quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; of 1902 gave the following description:

In Hoxton Street, a plaque marks the location of the Britannia Theatre. This evolved from the former Pimlico tea gardens, a tavern and a saloon, into a 3,000-seat theatre, designed by Finch Hill. Together with the nearby Pollock&#x27;s Toy Museum, it was destroyed in Second World War bombing. Hoxton Hall, also in Hoxton Street, which survives as a community centre, began life in 1863 as a &quot;saloon style&quot; music hall. It remains largely in its original form, as for many years it was used as a Quaker meeting house. There was also the 1870 Varieties Music Hall (by C. J. Phipps) in nearby Pitfield Street, this became a cinema in 1910, closing in 1941. In 2018 construction started on a refurbished cinema (operated by Curzon Cinemas) keeping the style of the original facade but expanding vertically to include residential properties. Planning permission for the refurbishment took a considerable time due to local opposition to the design. The cinema plans to open in 2019.

The National Centre for Circus Arts is based in the former vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch Electric Light Station, just to the north of Hoxton Market. Inside, the &quot;Generating Chamber&quot; and &quot;Combustion Chamber&quot; provide facilities for circus training and production. The building was constructed by the Vestry in 1895 to burn local rubbish and generate electricity. It also provided steam to heat the public baths. This replaced an earlier facility providing gas-light, located in Shoreditch.

Gainsborough Studios were located in a former power station, in Poole Street, by the Regents Canal. Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Balcon, Ivor Novello and Gracie Fields all worked at the studios, and films including &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; were shot there. The studios operated there from 1924 to 1951, and were demolished in 2002, replaced by a modern apartment block, also named Gainsborough Studios.

The Stag&#x27;s Head, Hoxton was built in 1936 for Truman&#x27;s Brewery, and designed by their in-house architect A. E. Sewell.

With a new-found popularity, large parts of Hoxton have been gentrified. This has inevitably aroused hostility among some local residents, who believe they are being priced out of the area. Some parts of Hoxton, however, remain deprived, with council housing dominating the landscape.

===Today===
The geographical distinction between Hoxton and Shoreditch is often confused. The two districts have a historical link as part of the same manor, and in the 19th century both formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch. This was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Hackney in 1965, but old street signs bearing the name are still to be found throughout the area. Both are also considered to be part of the East End of London. 

Manufacturing developments in the years after the Second World War meant that many of the small industries that characterised Hoxton moved out. By the early 1980s, these industrial lofts and buildings came to be occupied by young artists as inexpensive live/work spaces, while exhibitions, raves and clubs occupied former office and retail space at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time Joshua Compston established his Factual Nonsense gallery on Charlotte Road in Shoreditch and organised art fetes in Hoxton Square. Their presence gradually drew other creative industries into the area, especially magazines, design firms, and dot-coms.

By the end of the 20th century, the southern half of Hoxton had become a vibrant arts and entertainment district boasting a large number of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and art galleries. In this period, the new Hoxton residents could be identified by their obscurely fashionable (or &quot;ironically&quot; unfashionable) clothes and their hair (the so-called &quot;Hoxton Fin&quot;, as exemplified by Fran Healy of Travis). The excesses and fashion-centricity of Hoxton and Shoreditch denizens have been satirised in the satirical magazine &quot;Shoreditch Twat&quot;, on the TVGoHome website, and in the sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;. This fashionable area centres around Hoxton Square, a small park bordered mainly by former industrial buildings, as well as the elegant 19th century parish church of St John&#x27;s.

The northern half of the district is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to some parts of the borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal point of this end of the district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Museum of the Home and Hoxton War Memorial.

Property prices have continued to rise steeply since the early years of the 21st century as property developers have moved to cash in on the area&#x27;s trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.

===Hoxton Market===
Hoxton Market, which is now in Hoxton Street rather than its original site to the west of Hoxton Square, was founded in 1687. This market was the cornerstone of the local community but, from the 1980s onwards, changed from a thriving market to one that lost its trade to the move towards supermarkets and away from the traditional street market meeting all of the community&#x27;s needs. In 2013 the local business community, working with the council, started work to revive the market and this has attracted great attention and increased trade, complemented by new shops opening along the length of the market.

<doc id="94119" wikidata="Q7902626" url="?curid=94119" title="Ute mythology">
<text>The Ute mythology is the mythology of the Ute people, a tribe of Native Americans from the Western United States. Ute mythology is a body of stories and beliefs that are expressive of the cultural heritage and values of the Ute people.

== Ute creation story ==
Due to copyright, the mythological story of the creation of the Utes may be found on their official website. The Southern Ute Indian Tribe has shared recent versions of their creation story, emphasizing the continuous existence of the Utes within the boundaries of their ancestral home. According to Alden Naranjo, a Southern Ute elder, it is maintained in the creation narrative of the Ute that they have always occupied this mountainous region, in contrast to the creation stories of migration told in many other tribes. The Utes&#x27; strong relationship with their land is reinforced further by this perspective.

== Bear Dance ==
As told by Snake John, the story of the origin of the bear dance goes as follows:&quot;In the fall the snow comes, and the bear has a wickiup in a hole. He stays there all winter, perhaps six moons. In the spring the snow goes, and he comes out. The bear dances up to a big tree on his hind feet. He dances up and back, back and forth, and sings, &quot;Um, um, um, um!&quot; He makes a path up to the tree, embraces it, and goes back again, singing &quot;Um, Um, Um!&quot; He dances very much, all the time. Now Indians do it, and call it the &quot;Bear Dance.&quot; It happens in the spring, and they do not dance in the winter. The bear understands the Bear Dance.&quot;
== Key Ute mythological figures ==

Anthropological linguistics studies suggest animals are significant to Ute folklore. Traditional Ute linguistics includes words for Wolf, Little Bird, Mountain Lion, Fox, Mountain Sheep, Turtle, Bear, Coyote, and Weasle.

=== Wolf ===

* &quot;Creator and culture hero of the Ute tribe. Like other figures from the mythic age, Wolf is usually represented as a man in Ute stories, but sometimes takes on the literal form of a wolf.&quot;

=== Coyote ===

* &quot;Wolf&#x27;s younger brother, Coyote is a trickster figure. Though he often assists his brother and sometimes even does good deeds for the people, Coyote&#x27;s behavior is so irresponsible and frivolous that he is constantly getting himself and those around him into trouble.&quot;

==Folk tales==
* Pokoh, the Old Man
* Blood Clot
* Porcupine Hunts Buffalo, Hunt deer, Hunt elk, Hunt grasshoppers
* Puma and the Bear
* Two Grandsons
* Coyote &amp; Duck

<doc id="94120" wikidata="Q1951434" url="?curid=94120" title="Ickenham">
<text>Ickenham is an area in Greater London, forming the northern part of Uxbridge and within the London Borough of Hillingdon.

While no major historical events have taken place in Ickenham, settlements dating back to the Roman occupation of Britain have been discovered during archaeological surveys, and the area appears in the Domesday Book. Buildings from the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries remain standing and have been restored in recent years.

The village was originally split into four manors, but later there were two: Ickenham and Swakeleys. The old manorial home of Swakeleys, a 17th-century Jacobean mansion Swakeleys House still stands, and much of the Swakeleys estate was sold for housing in the 1920s. Ickenham&#x27;s manorial home, Manor Farm, now forms part of Long Lane Farm. A military station, RAF West Ruislip, was opened in 1917. Its final use was for the Navy Exchange of the U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom command between 1975 and 2006.

At the 1901 census, Ickenham had a population of 329; at the 2001 census the population had reached 9,933, although census figures show a marked population decline during the 1960s and 1970s. By the 2011 census, the population had reached 10,387. When Ickenham obtained a railway station on the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s line between Harrow and Uxbridge, a great deal of residential development started in the village, and it gradually became part of the London commuter belt. Ickenham expanded with the sale and development of much of the Swakeleys estate in 1922 and became part of what was later termed &quot;Metro-land&quot;.

== History ==
===Toponymy===
The name &#x27;Ickenham&#x27; means &#x27;homestead/village of Tic(c)a&#x27;. The T was lost in the 13th-14th centuries because of confusion with the Middle English word for &#x27;at&#x27;.

Ickenham appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 three times under the name &quot;Ticheham&quot;. Translated from Latin, the second entry reads:
The Domesday Book describes the land as being predominantly flat and composed of London clay with the exception of alluvium along the banks of the River Pinn. Of the few archaeological surveys of Ickenham carried out, one in 1994 by the Museum of London found a system of Roman fields dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries, along with pottery fragments. Research suggest that the area may have been abandoned for a period following the departure of the Romans from Britain around AD 410.

===Early developments===

Ickenham was originally divided into the four manors of Ickenham, Tykenham, Swalcliff (Swakeleys) and Herses (Hercies). Tykenham and Herses were within the parish of Hillingdon, though Herses subsequently became part of the manor of Swalcliff. These manors were eventually merged to form the main manors of Ickenham and Swakeleys. The original lord of the manor of Ickenham was Geoffrey de Mandeville, from whom it passed to William de Brock and then, in 1334, to John Charlton whose son John owned Swakeleys from 1350. By the mid-14th century, Ickenham was owned by the Shorediche family who retained possession until 1819.

The Crosier family, major landowners in north-west Middlesex, moved to Ickenham in the 16th century. They established their manorial home as Sherwyns, and owned Home Farm and Sears house in 1624. After the Shorediche family Milton Farm was bought by William Crosier in 1685. Edward Hilliard become the direct descendant of the final member of the Crosier family, John Crosier. Under the Hilliards, Milton Farm was sold to become part of the Swakeleys estate in 1816, and Hill Farm become Northolt Aerodrome in 1916. The Shorediche family built their manor house on a track off Long Lane. Originally called Ickenham Hall, it was let out to farmers in 1818 and renamed Manor Farm, at which point the Crosier family renamed their manorial home from Sherwyns to Ickenham Hall.

Swakeleys manor, subordinate to Ickenham, was named after Robert Swalcliffe, who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century. He appears in records as Robert de Swalclyve and Robert de Wykeham, reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in Oxfordshire. In 1347, he owed £40 to a money lender, Roger Rikeman, which he was unable to pay, and so his land in Ickenham was passed by Rikeman in 1350 to John de Charlton.

A descendant of John de Charlton, the first Sir Thomas de Charlton, died in 1448 whereupon Swakeleys passed to his son, also named Sir Thomas, who became Speaker of the House of Commons and member of parliament (MP) for Middlesex. He died in 1465, at which point his son Sir Richard became owner of the manor. Sir Richard was killed fighting on the side of Richard III during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The victor of the battle, Henry VII, named him in his Act of Attainder, though he granted Sir Richard&#x27;s wife Elizabeth a life interest in the manor. However, Sir Thomas Bourchier was subsequently granted the manor of Swakeleys and Covelhall (Cowley). Upon Sir Thomas&#x27; death in 1510, the manor passed to Sir John Peeche as his executor. Sir John had no children, so Swakeleys passed to the Earl of Devon, Henry Courteney in 1521. The Earl granted a licence to control Swakeleys to Sir William Fitzwilliam in 1531, who was acting as trustee for Ralph Pexall.
The lords of the manor of Swakeleys resided at Swakeleys House, though the house that stands today was not the first on the site. The original dated to around the 14th century and was probably constructed of wattle and timber. It was subject to extensive remedial work, much lamented at the time, while under the ownership of John Bingley. Bingley later sold the estate to Sir Edmund Wright, a future Lord Mayor of London, in 1629, and the current house was built of brick in 1638.

A church in Ickenham is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and it is likely that residents travelled to nearby Harefield for services. The original nave and chancel of St Giles&#x27; Church have been dated to 1335 while the nave was extended west in 1959. The bell turret was built in the 15th century and a brick aisle added in 1575.

&#x27;The Pump&#x27; is a significant local landmark. Donated to the village by Charlotte Gell, this water pump stands close to the village pond at the intersection of Swakeleys Road and Long Lane. After Gell&#x27;s death in 1863, under the provisions of her will a water pump was sunk for the benefit for the community in 1866. The village pond next to the pump was dug at the same time as the well for the pump was sunk, to accommodate waste from the construction. An older pond on the other side of the village was filled in with the excavated earth from the new one. In 1857 Gell had also donated some of her land near St Giles&#x27;s Church for five almshouses to be built for longstanding servants of the Gell household or Ickenham residents who were members of the Church of England. No more than three people were allowed to live in the houses at one time. The cottages remain and are maintained by the St Giles&#x27; Church. Next to the pump stands the Coach &amp; Horses public house, first licensed for the sale of alcohol in 1759 but of 16th-century origin. The house was used for manorial courts throughout the 19th century until the last was held in 1878.

===Urban development===

On 25 September 1905, following lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway opened a small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway company had been reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached with the construction of the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.

The marathon event of the 1908 Summer Olympics in London passed through Ickenham and Uxbridge on its way to the White City Stadium.

As a result of the railway, more commuters gradually moved to Ickenham and travelled to work in London. On 5 July 1922, of the Swakeleys estate was auctioned for development, thereby significantly reducing its size. Roads laid out for the new development were Warren Road, Swakeleys Drive, Court Road, Milton Road, Ivy House Road, The Avenue and Thornhill Road (originally named Park Road). Other land bordering the River Pinn was designated as public open land. Shops were built around Swakeleys Road, while houses were constructed along its length. The road was widened to become a dual carriageway in 1937. Milton Farm, one of the farms on the former Swakeleys estate was demolished in 1939. The farm&#x27;s pond and listed barn were cleared to make way for housing in what became Milton Road and Milton Court, though marketed as &quot;Ickenham Garden City&quot;.
A military station, operated by the Royal Air Force and later the United States Navy, was opened on part of Home Farm close to the parish boundary with Ruislip in 1917, later becoming known as RAF West Ruislip. The site was used originally for the British No. 4 Maintenance Unit, together with the RAF Records division. It became involved in the repair of aircraft equipment and later in the servicing of American vehicles from RAF South Ruislip. Between 1955 and 1975 the United States Air Force was based at the Ruislip station, before the U.S. Naval Activities, United Kingdom command leased the site from the Ministry of Defence for the American Naval Exchange.

The original village school was built on Ickenham High Road in 1866, although by 1920 it had become overcrowded. Older children were moved to the village hall in 1928 under the name Ickenham Temporary Council School. In 1929 the village school closed and its infant pupils also moved to the village hall. The road was widened in 1934 necessitating demolition of the school building along with the original Fox &amp; Geese public house.
The village pump remained in use until December 1914, while the handle was removed in 1921 by the local council for safe keeping but was never returned. The pump was restored in 2004 in partnership with a local building company, and a similar handle was fitted during the works.

Breakspear Primary School was built in 1937, followed by Glebe Primary in 1952 on the other side of the railway line. The Roman Catholic secondary school Douay Martyrs was built in 1962 and later expanded onto the former site of Swakeleys School nearby. Swakeleys School had opened in 1929 for older children from the village school. In 1952 the boys moved to the newly opened Abbotsfield School and Swakeleys became a girls&#x27; secondary modern school. The girls&#x27; school moved from Ickenham to share the site of Abbotsfield School for Boys in Hillingdon in 1973. Vyners School opened as a grammar school on 12 January 1960 and later became a comprehensive. Delays in building work meant the first intake of pupils were taught at St Mary&#x27;s Grammar School in Northwood Hills from 9 September 1959.

The village hall, designed by Clifton Davy, was built on part of Church Farm in 1926. Opened by Princess Victoria, as well as becoming the temporary village school the hall also became a restaurant during the Second World War and went on to be used as a bank and a polling station. A police telephone box was constructed next to the Pump in February 1936, and became operational on 4 May 1936. Church Farm opposite St Giles&#x27; church was demolished after the Second World War and replaced with shops, while new roads were built in the area. By 1951 the population of Ickenham had reached 7,107, and this had risen to 10,370 by 1961 and 11,214 by 1971. The ford over the River Pinn on Swakeleys Drive, nicknamed &quot;The Splash&quot;, was replaced in 1957 by a road bridge.
Middlesex County Council bought Ickenham Hall and its grounds in 1948 in order to convert it into a youth centre. In 1968 a theatre was built behind the hall, later named the Compass Theatre by the Theatre Director John Sherratt. A new building connecting the two was built in 1976.

During the Second World War Swakeleys House was requisitioned by the military and a searchlight battery established in the grounds. The house was Grade I listed in 1956, and the head gardener&#x27;s cottage on the junction of Swakeleys Road and The Avenue was Grade II listed in 1959.

The village library opened in 1962 on the site of the 16th century cottage and tea garden, The Orchard. Uxbridge Borough Council installed a three-sided clock commemorating the 1953 coronation of Elizabeth II in the library&#x27;s tower, having been persuaded not to add it to the eight-sided village pump.

In the 1980s, St Giles&#x27; church celebrated its 650th anniversary and formed a covenant with the neighbouring United Reformed Church. The United Reformed Church moved to its current building in 1936 after the previous chapel building proved too small for the growing congregation. It was then used by a local company as a wood and scrap metal yard. Nearby, many buildings on the RAF station were demolished to make way for a new housing estate named Brackenbury Village. The US Navy eventually left in 2006 and the base was permanently closed. The site was cleared in 2007 and is currently undergoing redevelopment as residential housing under the &quot;Ickenham Park&quot; name.

The local library was closed for a complete refurbishment in 2009 and reopened in March 2010.

A garden commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II was opened in September 2012 in Swakeleys Park. The garden, featuring a landscaped area and benches around a stone obelisk, was designed by the local council&#x27;s Green Spaces Team. The opening had been scheduled for 26 May 2012, although this was postponed after vandals destroyed the stone obelisk overnight shortly after it had been installed.

==Local government==
Ickenham had a parish council but came within the Uxbridge Rural District until 1925, when this was absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Uxbridge. This remained until 1965, when the borough was included in the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon. Within the borough of Hillingdon, all of Ickenham fell within the Ickenham ward, until 1999 when parts of the village were moved into adjoining wards to balance ward populations. Following further ward boundary changes in 2022, Ickenham currently falls within the Ickenham and South Ruislip ward, with Conservative Councillors Kaushik Banerjee, Martin Goddard and Eddie Lavery representing it.

Ickenham was within the Uxbridge constituency until boundary changes at the 2010 general election meant it became part of the new Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner constituency, represented by Nick Hurd MP.

==Demography==
72% of the population is White British, according to the 2011 census. The next largest groups are Indians (10.9%) and Other Whites (3.6%).

81.2% of people living in Ickenham were born in England. Other common places of birth include India (3%), Ireland (1.6%), and Kenya (1.3%).

The most common religious affiliations in Ickenham are Christians (60%), those of no religion (17.9%), Hindus (5.8%) and Sikhs (4.3%).

Almost half the housing stock, 45.3%, are detached houses. 40.3% are semi-detached, 9.4% flats/maisonettes/apartments, and 5% terraced.

== Education ==

Primary schools in Ickenham include Breakspear School, Breakspear Junior School, and Glebe Primary School. Secondary schools include The Douay Martyrs School and Vyners School. There is also Pentland Field School – a new special school on the former USA Navy site in Ickenham. This is for young people aged between 4 and 19 years old who have severe to moderate learning difficulties.

== Sports clubs and societies ==
Sports clubs in Ickenham include Ickenham Cricket Club and Ickenham Rugby Club. Hillingdon Athletics Club (an amalgamation of the Ruislip-Northwood and Uxbridge clubs), has attracted many athletes from Ickenham since its foundation in the 1960s.

The Ickenham and District Society of Model Engineers was formed in September 1948 and originally met in the old ARP huts, before moving to Ickenham Hall. On 14 May 1949, the society held their first exhibition of miniature locomotives in a field off Swakeleys Road. A new society clubhouse opened on 18 June 1955 on a site near the Coach &amp; Horses public house where it remains. The miniature railway is open to the public on the first Saturday of each month.

Ickenham&#x27;s residents&#x27; association was established in 1924, and it plays an active role within the community; in recent years the association has been involved in preventing developments by Tesco and IKEA, which in the association&#x27;s view would have adversely affected the town.

==Transport==
Ickenham tube station is served by the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines.

West Ruislip station (opened as Ruislip &amp; Ickenham) is on the border of Ruislip and Ickenham and is served by the Central line and Chiltern Main Line.

The London Buses routes U1, U10 and 278 serve Ickenham.

B467 (Swakeleys Road) and B466 (Long Lane) intersect in the centre of Ickenham. They link the Ickenham area with Harefield, Hillingdon and Ruislip.

==Landmarks and events==
===Pynchester Moat===
The Pynchester Moat is a Scheduled Ancient Monument on the River Pinn just east of Copthall Road West. Although usually dry in the summer months, the moat surrounding the location of a manor house can still be seen. Excavations of the site between 1966 and 1969 found pottery and an oven dating back to the 14th or 15th century. It is believed the manor house at the centre of the moat was &quot;Pynchester&quot;, a building owned by the Hastings family in the 16th century.

The moat is a point of interest on the Celandine Route, a walk along the River Pinn from Pinner to the Grand Union Canal at Cowley.

===Swakeleys House===
Built between 1629 and 1638 for Sir Edmund Wright, the house replaced an existing structure dating back to the 14th century. In later years the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Sports Association bought the house, followed by the London Postal Region Sports Club. Cricket matches between the club and local teams from Ickenham and Uxbridge were played within the grounds. The house was bought by three local residents in the 1980s and restored, whereupon it was leased to Bristol-Myers Squibb for 25 years. Since the expiry of the lease in 2009, the house has been open to the public for one day a year as part of Open House London.

===Ickenham Festival===
The biennial Ickenham Festival has taken place in the town since 1976, originally with the aim of highlighting the variety of societies and groups in the area. The festival normally centres on a charity gala day in June, when various groups including Scouts, church groups and schools parade through the town, finishing with a large fête in the grounds of Swakeleys House. Fireworks mark the end of the festival in the evening. The festival Gala moved to the grounds of Vyners School in 2014 after a dispute with the owner of Swakeleys House.

<doc id="94123" wikidata="Q124295" url="?curid=94123" title="Isle of Dogs">
<text>The Isle of Dogs is a large peninsula bounded on three sides by a large meander in the River Thames in East London, England. It includes the Cubitt Town, Millwall and Canary Wharf districts. The area was historically part of the Manor, Hamlet, Parish and, for a time, the wider borough of Poplar. The name had no official status until the 1987 creation of the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood by Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. It has been known locally as simply &quot;the Island&quot; since the 19th century.

The whole area was once known as Stepney Marsh; Anton van den Wyngaerde&#x27;s &quot;Panorama of London&quot; dated 1543 depicts and refers to the Isle of Dogs. Records show that ships preparing to carry the English royal household to Calais in 1520 docked at the southern bank of the island. The name &quot;Isle of Dogges&quot; occurs in the &quot;Thamesis Descriptio&quot; of 1588, applied to a small island in the south-western part of the peninsula. The name is next applied to the &quot;Isle of Dogs Farm&quot; (originally known as &quot;Pomfret Manor&quot;) shown on a map of 1683. At the same time, the area was variously known as &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; or the &quot;Blackwell levels&quot;. By 1855, it was incorporated within the parish of Poplar under the aegis of the Poplar Board of Works. This was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar on its formation in 1900.

==Geology==
The soil is alluvial and silty in nature, underlaid by clay or mud, with a peat layer in places.

==Etymology and heraldry==
The first known written mention of the Isle of Dogs is in the &quot;Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot;. In Volume 3, entry 1009 &quot;Shipping&quot; dated 2 October 1520, there is a list of purchases, which includes &quot;A hose for the Mary George, in dock at the Isle of Dogs, 10d.&quot;

The 1898 edition of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; attributes the name: &quot;So called from being the receptacle of the greyhounds of Edward III. Some say it is a corruption of the Isle of Ducks, and that it is so called in ancient records from the number of wild fowl inhabiting the marshes.&quot; Other sources discount this, believing these stories to all derive from the antiquarian John Strype, and believe it might come from one of the following:
*a nickname of contempt: Ben Jonson and Thomas Nashe wrote a satirical play in 1597, which was a mocking attack on the island of Great Britain, titled &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, which offended some in the nobility. Jonson was imprisoned for a year; Nashe avoided arrest by fleeing the area. Samuel Pepys referred to the &quot;unlucky Isle of Doggs.&quot;
*the presence of Dutch engineers reclaiming the land from a disastrous flood.
*the presence of gibbets on the foreshore facing Greenwich.
*a yeoman farmer called &quot;Brache&quot;, this being an old word for a type of hunting dog.
*the dogs of a later king, Henry VIII, who also kept deer in Greenwich Park. Again it is thought that his hunting dogs might have been kept in derelict farm buildings on the island. Now known as the area West Ferry Circus.
* Isle of Dykes, which then got corrupted over the years.
Laura Wright in a 2015 essay showed that in the Elizabethan era the term &quot;Isle of Dogges&quot; was applied to a small eyot (mud island) lying offshore the present-day Isle of Dogs. It was across the river from the royal Deptford dockyard, whose vessels being outfitted were moored at the eyot; the first record of the name appears about the time the dockyard was established. The peninsula itself at that time was always known as Stepney Marsh. A government map, prepared in connection with the Thames defences at the time of the Spanish Armada, suggests the eyot was a recognised navigational landmark alongside an otherwise featureless marsh. Later, the name was extended to a farm on the peninsula, and then to the peninsula itself. That the name referred to the site of royal kennels, she argued, was unsupported speculation 200 years after the first attested usage. Dr Wright offered a speculation of her own: that the name &quot;dogs&quot; was bestowed by the Deptford dockyard workers as a punning reference to the barks (naval vessels) moored at this eyot.

The lost Ben Jonson/Thomas Nashe play (above) was vigorously pursued by the authorities, who even employed a torturer to track down its authors. &quot;The severity of the response seems too great to have been triggered by an attack on a mere individual&quot;; it has been hypothesised that what the play satirised was the then appalling state of England&#x27;s defences, the play&#x27;s title &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; being taken to mean the place where the Queen&#x27;s ships were outfitted.

It is said that Canary Wharf, located in the Isle of Dogs, took its name from sea trade with the Canary Islands, which were named in Latin as (). However the name Canary Wharf does not appear until 1936.

The Talbot dog in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets represents the Isle of Dogs.

==Society==

Following the building of the Docks (especially the West India Docks and the adjacent City Canal), and with an increasing population, locals increasingly referred to the area as &quot;The Island&quot;. This area includes Millwall, Cubitt Town, and Blackwall. The south of the isle opposite Greenwich was once known as &quot;North Greenwich&quot;, now applied to the area around the Millennium Dome on the Greenwich Peninsula. Between 1986 and 1992 it enjoyed a brief formal existence, as the name &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; was applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to which power was devolved from the council. The neighbourhood was later abolished.

It was the site of the highest concentration of council housing in England but is now best known as the location of the Canary Wharf office complex. One Canada Square, also known as the Canary Wharf Tower, is the second tallest habitable building in Britain at . The peninsula is an area of social extremes, comprising some of the most prosperous and most deprived areas of the country; in 2004, nearby Blackwall was the 81st most deprived ward in England out of over 8,000, while the presence of Canary Wharf gives the area one of the highest average incomes in the UK. Lincoln Plaza was the 2016 winner of the Carbuncle Cup for the year&#x27;s &quot;worst new building&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; described it as &quot;mediocre at best, ugly at worst&quot;.

==History==


===Origins===
The Isle of Dogs is situated some distance downriver from the City of London. It was originally marsh, being several feet below water at high tide. In the Middle Ages it was made available for human habitation by a process known in the Thames estuary as inning. The reclaimed land was below high water, protected by earthen banks. These banks if not properly kept up were liable to be breached. This happened in 1448, drowning the land for 40 years.

In 1660, the river started to break through the neck of the peninsula, initiating meander cutoff. This was arrested by human intervention, but it left a 5-acre lake called Poplar Gut. It appears on John Rocque&#x27;s 1746 &quot;Map of London and ten miles around&quot;, in the extract reproduced in this article.
One road led across the Marshes to an ancient ferry, at Ferry Road. There was rich grazing on the marsh, and cattle were slaughtered in fields known as the &quot;Killing Fields&quot;, south of Poplar High Street.

The western side of the island was known as &quot;Marsh Wall&quot;, and the district became known as &quot;Millwall&quot; with the building of the docks, and from the number of windmills constructed along the top of the flood defence.

===Industry===

In 1802, the West India Docks began to be developed on the Isle of Dogs. Beginning in 1812 the Poplar and Greenwich Ferry Roads Company installed tolls on the East Ferry Road. These proved to be unpopular and after many years of lobbying the Metropolitan Board of Works bought the company and abolished the tolls in 1885.

The Docks brought with them many associated industries, such as flour and sugar processing, and also ship building. On 31 January 1858 the largest ship of that time, the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott, Russell &amp; Co, of Millwall. The length was too big for the river so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch this was the last big ship to be built on the Island and the industry fell into a decline. However, parts of the launching slipway and plate works have been preserved in situ and may be seen close to Masthouse Terrace Pier.

===Docks===
The urbanisation of the Isle of Dogs took place in the 19th century following the construction of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802. This heralded the area&#x27;s most successful period, when it became an important centre for trade. The East India Docks were subsequently opened in 1806, followed by Millwall Dock in 1868.

By the 1880s, the casual employment system caused Dock workers to unionise under Ben Tillett and John Burns. This led to a demand for &quot;6d per hour&quot; (2.5p), and an end to casual labour in the docks. After a bitter struggle, the London Dock Strike of 1889 was settled with victory for the strikers, and established a national movement for the unionisation of casual workers.

The three dock systems were unified in 1909 when the Port of London Authority took control of the docks. With the docks stretching across from East to West with locks at each end, the Isle of Dogs could now almost be described as a genuine island.

Dock workers settled on the &quot;island&quot; as the docks grew in importance, and by 1901, 21,000 people lived there, largely dependent on the river trade on the Isle as well as in Greenwich and Deptford across the river to the south and west. The Isle of Dogs was connected to the rest of London by the London and Blackwall Railway, opened in 1840 and progressively extended thereafter. In 1902, the ferry to Greenwich was replaced by the construction of the Greenwich foot tunnel, and Island Gardens park was laid out in 1895, providing views across the river. The London and Blackwall Railway closed in 1926. Until the building of the Docklands Light Railway in 1987, the only public transport accessing and exiting the Island consisted of buses using its perimeter roads. These were frequently and substantially delayed by the movement of up to four bridges which allowed ships access to the West India Docks and Millwall Docks. The insular nature of the Island caused its separateness from the rest of London, and its unique nature.

During World War II, the docks were a key target for the German Luftwaffe and were heavily bombed. A number of local civilians were killed in the bombing and extensive destruction was caused on the ground, with many warehouses being destroyed and much of the dock system being put out of action for an extended period. Unexploded bombs from this period continue to be discovered today. Anti-aircraft batteries were based on Mudchute Farm; their concrete bases remain today.

After the war, the docks underwent a brief resurgence and were even upgraded in 1967. However, with the advent of containerisation, which the docks could not handle, they became obsolete soon afterwards. The docks closed progressively during the 1970s, with the last – the West India and Millwall docks – closing down in 1980. This left the area in a severely dilapidated state, with large areas being derelict and abandoned.

===&#x27;Unilateral declaration of independence&#x27;===
Local residents resented the scarcity of schools and supermarkets and inadequate transport to neighbourhoods that did have them.
On 1 March 1970 a group of activists led by Ted John and John Westfallen, in a reference to the Republic of Rhodesia&#x27;s recent unilateral declaration of independence or UDI, issued a UDI for the Isle of Dogs. For two hours (though some reports say a day, others a week) they blocked the two swing-bridges providing the only access to the area by road. According to Johns the intent was semi-jocular and the purpose was only to achieve independence from the rest of London, a right already enjoyed by the nearby City: it was the Press who dubbed him &quot;President Ted of the Isle of Dogs&#x27;. Nevertheless, and though a body of local opinion resented the stunt, it achieved wide national and international publicity. It featured on the front page of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and Johns was interviewed by satellite by Walter Cronkite for &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. A new secondary school and improvements in public transport materialised. According to one source it even served as the catalyst for the eventual development of Canary Wharf.

Patricia Cornwell&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; features an island off the coast of Virginia that declares UDI, &quot;claiming its independence lies with those who set sail from the Isle of Dogs in 1607&quot;.

===London Docklands Development Corporation===
Successive Labour and Conservative governments proposed a number of action plans during the 1970s but it was not until 1981 that the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was established to redevelop the area. The Isle of Dogs became part of an enterprise zone, which covered 1.95 km2 of land and encompassed the West India, Millwall and East India Docks. New housing, office space and transport infrastructure were built. This included the Docklands Light Railway and later the Jubilee line extension, which eventually brought access to the London Underground to the area for the first time.

Since its construction in 1987–1991, the area has been dominated by the expanding Canary Wharf development with over of office and retail space having been created; 93,000 now work in Canary Wharf alone.

===Politics===

The Island achieved notoriety in 1993 when Derek Beackon of the British National Party became a councillor for Millwall ward, in a by-election. This was the culmination of years when race was a prominent issue in local politics, especially with regards to allocation of housing. Labour regained the ward in the full council election of May 1994, and held all three seats until a further by-election in September 2004.

===Incidents===
On 9 February 1996, the IRA detonated a truck bomb near South Quay DLR station on the Isle of Dogs that killed two people and injured more than a hundred others.

==Education==
There are four state primary schools located on the Isle of Dogs – Cubitt Town Junior School, Arnhem Wharf, Harbinger School and St Edmunds. There was also an independent primary school, River House Montessori, located near South Quay, but this closed in 2024.

George Green&#x27;s School is a secondary school and Specialist Humanities School at the southern tip of the island.

Canary Wharf College is a free school on the Island which covers primary and secondary education.

==Transport==

===London Underground, DLR, and Elizabeth line stations===
The nearest London Underground station is Canary Wharf on the Jubilee line. Key areas including Regent&#x27;s Park, The West End, Westminster, South Bank, Millennium Dome and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, are all within 20 minutes of Canary Wharf by Tube.

The DLR runs north–south through the Isle of Dogs. DLR stations are Canary Wharf, Heron Quays, South Quay, Crossharbour, Mudchute and Island Gardens. Key areas including the City of London, Tower Hill and Greenwich are all within 20 minutes of the Isle of Dogs by DLR.

The Elizabeth line&#x27;s Canary Wharf station opened in 2022. Situated at the north of the Island, it provides high-frequency, fast connections to the heart of the West End, Paddington Station, Heathrow Airport and Abbey Wood.

===London bus routes===
* London Buses route 135
* London Buses route 277
* London Buses route D3
* London Buses route D6
* London Buses route D7
* London Buses route D8
* London Buses route N550

===River bus services===
Regular commuter boat services serve both Masthouse Terrace Pier and Canary Wharf Pier on the Isle of Dogs.

The Thames Clippers provides regular commuter services to Woolwich Arsenal Pier, Greenwich Pier in the east, and the City of London including St. Katherine Docks, Tower Bridge, , Greater London Authority building, Tate Modern, Blackfriars, as well as the West End of London in the west on the commuter service. There is also a connecting shuttle service to Rotherhithe and the Tate to Tate service from Tate Modern to Tate Britain via London Eye.

From Summer 2007, the service has been enhanced with express boats from central London to the O2 Arena (former Millennium Dome).

===Pedestrian and cyclists===
The Thames Path National Trail runs along the riverside. At the southern end of the Isle of Dogs, the Greenwich foot tunnel provides pedestrian access to Greenwich, across the river.

National Cycle Network route 1 runs through the foot tunnel (although cycles must not be ridden in the tunnel itself).

===Airport and helipad===
The nearest airport is London City Airport, which is 25 minutes away from Canary Wharf by DLR.

There is also a helipad situated on the west of the Island and next to Ferguson&#x27;s Wharf, which is privately run by Vanguard.

=== Sailing and watersports activities ===
The presence of docks, some of a considerable size, has enabled a practice of various watersports, like sailing, kayaking, windsurfing and standup paddleboarding.

Docklands Sailing and Watersports Centre is one of the main reference spots for watersports fans.

The Duchess of Cambridge visited the centre in 2017.

==In the media==

T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; contains the lines &quot;The barges wash / Drifting logs / Down Greenwich reach / Past the Isle of Dogs.&quot;

In modern times the Isle of Dogs has provided locations for many blockbuster films, including the opening scenes of the James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, and more recently &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Love Actually&quot;. The Isle of Dogs featured heavily in the 1980 British film &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;, and the Isle of Dogs is the primary location of the 2007 horror film &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, where it is the only secure and quarantined area in all of Britain suitable for recivilisation after a virus epidemic kills the population of Britain.

The Isle of Dogs was the setting for the 1986 Channel 4 comedy-drama &quot;Prospects&quot; starring Gary Olsen and Brian Bovell.

While shooting in East London for his film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;, Wes Anderson spotted a road sign directing to the Isle of Dogs. This sparked his imagination, becoming an eponymous source of inspiration for his animated 2018 film &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;.

In a 2024 episode of British drama series &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; set in March 1970, blockades as part of the declared independence of the Isle impede the ability of midwives in Poplar to transport a high risk pregnancy to hospital.

<text>A muzzleloader is any firearm in which the user loads the projectile and the propellant charge into the muzzle end of the gun (i.e., from the forward, open end of the gun&#x27;s barrel). This is distinct from the modern designs of breech-loading firearms, in which user loads the ammunition into the breech end of the barrel. The term &quot;muzzleloader&quot; applies to both rifled and smoothbore type muzzleloaders, and may also refer to the marksman who specializes in the shooting of such firearms. The firing methods, paraphernalia and mechanism further divide both categories as do caliber (from cannons to small-caliber palm guns).

Modern muzzleloading firearms range from reproductions of sidelock, flintlock and percussion long guns, to in-line rifles that use modern inventions such as a closed breech, sealed primer and fast rifling to allow for considerable accuracy at long ranges.

Modern mortars use a shell with the propelling charge and primer attached at the base. Unlike older muzzleloading mortars, which were loaded the same way as muzzleloading cannon, the modern mortar is fired by dropping the shell down the barrel where a pin fires the primer, igniting the main propelling charge. Both the modern mortar and the older mortar were used for high angle fire. However, the fact that the mortar is not loaded in separate steps may make its definition as a muzzleloader a matter of opinion.

Muzzleloading can apply to anything from cannons to pistols but in modern parlance the term most commonly applies to black powder small arms. It usually, but not always, involves the use of a loose propellant (i.e., gunpowder) and projectile, as well as a separate method of ignition or priming.

==Loading==
In general, the sequence of loading is to put in first gunpowder, by pouring in a measured amount of loose powder, historically mostly by using a powder flask (or powder horn), or by inserting a pre-measured bag or paper packet of gunpowder (called a cartridge) or by inserting solid propellant pellets. The gunpowder used is typically black powder or black powder substitutes like Pyrodex. Sometimes two types of gunpowder (and two flasks) were used consisting of finer priming powder for the flash pan and coarser powder for the main charge behind the ball. This was particularly the case with earlier muzzleloaders like matchlocks but appear to have been less common with flintlocks and was irrelevant with percussion locks since they used percussion caps rather than priming powder.

Wadding is made from felt, paper, cloth or card and has several different uses. In shotguns, a card wad or other secure wadding is used between the powder and the shot charge to prevent pellets from dropping into the powder charge and on top of the shot charge to hold it in place in the barrel. In smooth bore muskets and most rifles used prior to cartridges being introduced in the mid-to late nineteenth century, wadding was used primarily to hold the powder in place.
On most naval cannons, one piece of wadding was used to hold the powder in place and served the purpose of creating a better seal around the shot. Another was used to act as a plug to stop the shot rolling out because of the swaying of the ship.

The use of cartridges with both gunpowder charge and ball, made up in batches by the shooter or a servant, was known from very early on, but until roughly around 1800 loading using a powder flask and a bag of balls was more common outside of the military. The measuring stage for the barrel charge of gunpowder could be avoided by carrying a number of pre-measured charges in small containers of wood, metal or cloth, often carried on a bandolier. These were known by various names, including &quot;chargers&quot; or &quot;apostles&quot; as 12 were often carried. For most of the time muzzleloaders were in use, a round ball and pre-measured powder charge could be carried in a paper or cloth wrapping. The shooter would bite off the end of the paper cartridge with his teeth and pour the powder into the barrel followed by the ball encased in the paper wrapping.

The projectiles and wads were then pushed down into the breech with a ramrod until they were firmly seated on the propellant charge. Priming powder could be carried in a separate priming flask and poured into the priming pan or a little powder from the cartridge was used, and the frizzen was pushed down to hold the priming powder in place. After the gunpowder and projectile or shot charge were placed in the barrel a ramrod was used to firmly pack everything down at the base of the barrel. Then either a priming charge was placed in the priming pan or a percussion cap was placed on the nipple, the firing mechanism initiated; the cock or hammer was then cocked to make the firearm ready to fire.

==Projectile types and history==

Muzzleloading firearms generally use round balls, cylindrical conical projectiles, and shot charges.

In some types of rifles firing round ball, a lubricated patch (see Kentucky rifle) of fabric is wrapped around a ball which is slightly smaller than the barrel diameter. In other types of round ball firing rifles, a ramrod and hammer is used to force the round ball down through the rifling. When fired, either the lead ball or the wrapping grips the rifling and imparts spin to the ball which usually gives improved accuracy. In rifles firing Minié balls, the patch, often the paper wrapping from the cartridge, is used as an initial seal and to hold powder in place during loading.

The Minié ball replaced the round ball in most firearms, especially for military use, in the 1840s and 1850s. It has a hollow base which expands to grip the rifling. The combination of the spinning Minié ball and the consistent velocity provided by the improved seal gave far better accuracy than the smoothbore muzzleloaders that it replaced.

==Modern usage==
When aiming for great accuracy, muzzle-loaders are usually cleaned (&quot;swabbed&quot;) before reloading, so that there is no residue left in the barrel to reduce accuracy, though in competitions run by the international governing body, the MLAIC, this is prohibited for military rifle and musket events. However, in small arms muzzleloading rifles, swabbing is only done after every 5-10 shots. Large caliber muzzle-loaders such as cannons are always swabbed between shots to prevent accidents caused by live sparks igniting the fresh charge of powder as it is being loaded.

==Muzzleloading==
Muzzleloading is the sport or pastime of firing muzzleloading guns. Muzzleloading guns, both antique and reproduction, are used for target shooting, hunting, historical re-enactment and historical research. The sport originated in the United States in the 1930s, just as the last original users and makers of muzzleloading arms were dying out. The sport received a tremendous boost in the 1960s and 1970s. The Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (www.MLAIC.org) was formed in 1970 and held its first World Championship in 1971. Since then a flourishing industry manufacturing working reproductions of historic firearms now exists in the United States and Europe, particularly in northern Italy, for example at Gardone Val Trompia, in the Province of Brescia. In the United States muzzleloading guns are, subject to a number of qualifications, generally not considered firearms. Subject to state law they may be possessed by persons who might otherwise not be legally allowed to own a firearm.

The American National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association holds two national tournaments a year in Friendship, Indiana as well as the Western National Shoot Event held in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Muzzle Loaders Associations International Committee (MLAIC) governs international competition with muzzle-loading arms. The MLAIC holds a Short Range World Championship in even-numbered years and a Long Range World Championship () on odd numbered years (South Africa has won the last 5 Long Range World Championships).

===Modern use===
Driven by demand for muzzleloaders for special extended primitive hunting seasons, firearms manufacturers have developed in-line muzzleloading rifles with designs similar to modern breech-loading centerfire designs. Knight Rifles pioneered the in-line muzzleloader in the mid-1980s, manufacturing and selling them to this day. Savage Arms has created the 10ML-II, which can be used with smokeless powder, reducing the cleaning required. However, Savage has discontinued the production of smokeless muzzleloaders. Remington Firearms also have a muzzleloader in production, the model &quot;700 Ultimate&quot; or &quot;700 SL Ultimate&quot;. There are several custom gun makers that are currently building smokeless muzzleloaders on new or donor bolt actions.

<text>Isleworth ( ) is a suburban town in the London Borough of Hounslow, West London, England. 

It lies immediately east of Hounslow and west of the River Thames and its tributary the River Crane. Isleworth&#x27;s original area of settlement, alongside the Thames, is known as Old Isleworth. The northwest corner of the town, bordering on Osterley to the north and Lampton to the west, is known as Spring Grove.

Isleworth&#x27;s former Thames frontage of approximately one mile, excluding that of the Syon Park estate, was reduced to little over half a mile in 1994 when a borough boundary realignment was effected in order to unite the district of St Margaret&#x27;s wholly within London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. As a result, most of Isleworth&#x27;s riverside is that part overlooking the islet of Isleworth Ait: the short-length River Crane flows into the Thames south of the Isleworth Ait, and its artificial distributary the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s River west of the Isleworth Ait, one of two Colne distributaries constructed for aesthetic reasons between 1600 and 1750.

==Etymology==
==History==

===Roman and Anglo Saxon===
Excavations around the eastern end of the Syon Park estate have unearthed evidence of a Romano-British settlement. &#x27;Gislheresuuyrth&#x27;, meaning in Old English &quot;Enclosure belonging to [a man called] Gīslhere&quot;, is first referred to as a permanent settlement in an Anglo-Saxon charter in the year 695. The Domesday Book says that during the reign (1042–1066) of Edward the Confessor the manor belonged to &quot;Earl Algar&quot; (probably Ælfgar of Mercia), and a modern road off South St today carries his name.

===Granted to St Valeri Barons===
Isleworth was a well-cultivated farming and trading settlement, more valuable than many of its neighbours, stretching from the Middlesex bank of the River Thames west to the centre of Hounslow (including the land of later Hounslow Priory) and as far as the borders of Southall (in Hayes parish at the time) at the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066. The Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Gistelesworde&quot; records its 55 ploughlands, 118 households and amount rendered, £72 per year, to its feudal system overlords. After the Conquest, successive Norman barons of the St Valeri family held the manor of Isleworth but there is no evidence that they ever lived there – it being held as a source of revenue and power. One of the later barons gave several manorial rents and privileges to London&#x27;s Hospital of St Giles. He also gave the church and advowson to the Abbey of St Valeri, which stood at the mouth of the Somme in Picardy.

===Transfer to Earldom of Cornwall===

In 1227, when he took control of England from his childhood regents, Henry III seized Isleworth and other property of the St Valeri family and gave the manor to his brother, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. He built a new moated manor house, which is described in the Black Book of the Exchequer – having a tiled roof, chimney, two bedchambers and an inner courtyard. Beyond the moat was an outer courtyard with a number of buildings for servants and supplies, and a short distance away was a watermill. 

The exact location of this house is not recorded, but a report of an area long ago known as &#x27;Moated Place&#x27; puts the likely place between the Northumberland Arms and Twickenham Road, with the watermill being near Railshead, on the River Crane (not where the traditional Isleworth mill &#x27;Kidd&#x27;s Mill&#x27;, because the stream there is artificial and did not exist at that time). The seemingly classic medieval manor house was burned down during the Second Barons&#x27; War in 1264.

===Advowson, right to appoint the vicar===
The Abbey of St Valeri in Picardy held the livings (benefices) and revenues of several English parish church lands and, responding to growing disquiet over these foreign holdings, in 1391 it transferred those of Isleworth (for a fee) to William of Wykeham, who endowed them to Winchester College, which he founded. The Wardens and Scholars of Winchester College therefore became proprietors of productive rectory (which had glebelands). This lasted for 150 years, then in 1543 King Henry VIII exchanged with Winchester certain manors elsewhere for five churches in Middlesex, including All Saints. 

Four years later he gave the Isleworth rectory and advowson to the Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but they returned to the crown when the Duke was executed in 1552. Soon after, they were given to the Dean and Canons of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, with whom they remain today. The castle-like stone church tower by the river remains from this period, see below.

===Transfer of Manor to Syon Monastery===
In 1415 Henry V granted nuns from the Swedish Bridgettine order land on the bank of the Thames, in Twickenham parish opposite his new Sheen Palace, where they built their first house Syon Monastery. In 1422 Henry V transferred ownership of Isleworth Manor from the Duchy of Cornwall to Syon Monastery, which in 1431 selected a new location within their manor to rebuild their monastery. This is the site of the present Syon House.

===Granted to Duke of Somerset===
Henry VIII demolished most of Syon Monastery after 1539 and the site and manor was granted to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. It was Seymour who built Syon House in 1548. Lady Jane Grey was taken from here to the Tower by Royal barge in anticipation of her being crowned Queen of England.

===Acquired by Earl of Northumberland===
Forty-six years later, in 1594 Queen Elizabeth I granted a lease of the manor of Syon to Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland on his marriage to Dorothy Devereux the younger daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, who later received a grant of the freehold from King James I in 1604. It has remained in the possession of the Percy family, now the Dukedom of Northumberland, for over four hundred years. The Royalist army occupied the house during the Battle of Brentford in November 1642. Syon Park was rebuilt and landscaped by the Adam brothers and &quot;Capability&quot; Brown between 1766 and 1773. It became the new home of the Dukes of Northumberland when Northumberland House in the Strand was demolished in 1874.

===Georgian and Victorian times===

Much of Isleworth became orchards in the 18th century (including part of Hugh Ronalds&#x27; renowned nursery), and then market gardens in the 19th century, supplying the London markets. Lower Square and Church Street still have buildings dating from the 18th and early 19th centuries. A striking element of this period was the establishment in Isleworth of many mansions and large houses, principally for aristocrats and high achievers. This phenomenon arose owing mainly to the collection of royal and noble residences and ecclesiastical establishments that already existed nearby. The subject is examined in depth in the &quot;Notable houses&quot; section.

There is evidence of a Black community in Isleworth in the 18th century. This community was primarily made up of enslaved people of colour, from Africa, Asia or the Caribbean. Some of these people had fled from bondage and chose to seek their freedom in the streets of London. With very few exceptions, little is known about people of colour in 18th century London. However, as a result of contemporary sources like advertisements seeking the capture and return of runaway slaves, an insight can be gained into the lives of two people, Marina Dellap and Prince, who resided in the area in 1765.

===20th century===
The first half of the 20th century for Isleworth generally was characterised by a very substantial amount of artisan and white-collar residential development throughout the town, at the expense of numerous market gardens. The former western area was ceded to the town and parish of Hounslow, which was invested as a civil parish in 1927. This period also included the building of several new factories and offices, mostly towards the north-east, up to the town&#x27;s eastern boundary with New Brentford. This rapid spread of building transformed the nature of Isleworth&#x27;s layout in the space of just fifty years, from an agrarian pattern to an urban one.

Isleworth&#x27;s former Thames frontage of approximately one mile, excluding that of the Syon estate, which is shared with Brentford, was reduced to in 1994 when a borough boundary realignment was ordered by the UK&#x27;s Local Government Minister to add land to the district of St Margarets, Twickenham.

==Geography==
Elevations range from in the northwest to by the Thames at the opposite extreme OD. The boundaries are longstanding, subject to twentieth-century western and southern circonscriptions: Isleworth is east of the town of Hounslow which has more retail and offices, in the borough of that name; west of the River Thames; north of its tributary and the northern confluence of the Crane (before 1998 its southern channel); and south of the crest by the M4 motorway separating the Brent and Crane catchments. Half of the River Crane flows into the Thames south of the Ait, and its distributary the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s River flows toward its midpoint from the west.

==Amenities==

Isleworth is home to Isleworth Crown Court whose original remit has been expanded to include judicial work formerly conducted at the Middlesex Crown Court; an extension to create six new courtrooms was completed in 2009.

The town&#x27;s municipal facilities include a public library, a public leisure centre with swimming pool, a gymnasium, four recreation grounds, and a town hall.

There used to be a film studio in Worton Road, Isleworth. Known variously as Worton Hall Studios and Isleworth Studios, its most notable film was &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. After the Studio closed, the premises became a Mining Research Establishment for the National Coal Board. It is now an industrial estate.

Isleworth has been home to satellite television broadcaster Sky since its launch in 1989 by Rupert Murdoch. Originally centred on Grant Way, the sprawling campus around Gillette Corner once took in New Horizons Court and is now the sole occupier of the Centaurs Business Park, with offices, studios, production space, research and development facilities, plus a dedicated energy centre including a wind turbine by Arup Associates.

The Boat Cathja is moored in Old Isleworth. This is unique 38 metre barge which has been the home of a mental health charity since 1996. It helps mentally disabled people a chance to hone into their artistic skills. Situated on the boat is the Sculpture &quot;The Heron&quot; by Martin Cotts.

Isleworth was home to opera group &quot;Isleworth Baroque&quot; (now Richmond Opera) from 2002 to 2015.

===Hospitals===
Brentford Workhouse Infirmary and West Middlesex Hospital (historic)

The Brentford Poor Law Union had a workhouse built in 1838 covering much land to the east of Twickenham Road in Isleworth. At the turn of the 20th century, this was totally rebuilt as an infirmary, with a much larger workhouse newly erected in the grounds. This infirmary functioned until 1920, when it became &#x27;West Middlesex Hospital&#x27;. In 1931 it was upgraded to a county hospital, but in 1948 (under the NHS) &#x27;County&#x27; was dropped from its title. It later became a teaching hospital, and added &#x27;University&#x27; to its title in 1980. The Victorian buildings were closed in 2003, and redeveloped as housing, called Union Lane, after the original workhouse. The hospital was rebuilt on the adjacent site.

West Middlesex University Hospital (NHS Trust)

This is a major acute hospital on the Twickenham Road, Isleworth, with 394 beds, providing the full range of services expected of a general hospital. It serves residents of both the London boroughs of Hounslow and Richmond. As a university hospital it is affiliated with Imperial College London. A programme of building, renovation and modernisation in recent years has resulted in the hospital offering modern facilities.

 Percy House Auxiliary Military Hospital (historic)

Within the old union workhouse complex stood a school, facing Twickenham Road, called Percy House – Percy being the surname of the dukes of Northumberland. Owing to its gradual disuse as a school it was adapted to function as a military hospital during World War I of 1914–18. From 1915 onwards it treated some 5,000 war-wounded soldiers, and ceased operation at the end of 1918. Among the VAD nurses was Sophia Duleep Singh. The building was demolished in 1978.

Mogden Isolation Hospital (historic)

For nearly a hundred years an isolation hospital existed on the south side of Mogden Lane, which runs west from Twickenham Road. Opened in 1897, Mogden Isolation Hospital was renamed &#x27;South Middlesex Fever Hospital&#x27; in 1938 but continued under local authority control. When the National Health Service was formed it became, in 1948, simply South Middlesex Hospital. It closed in 1991.

==Transport==

===Routes===
The principal road in Isleworth is the London Road (A 315), which broadly follows the route of one of the early roads the Romans constructed in Britannia, namely Tamesis Street, built across the wide heathlands &quot;en route&quot; to Silchester, from where other roads led to Bath, Winchester and Salisbury.

As this road from the centre of London passes through Westminster it is called &#x27;Piccadilly&#x27; and then &#x27;Knightsbridge&#x27;. In Kensington it is &#x27;High Street&#x27;, in Hammersmith &#x27;King Street&#x27;, in Chiswick it&#x27;s the &#x27;High Road&#x27;, in Brentford it&#x27;s the &#x27;High Street&#x27;, and as Isleworth&#x27;s &#x27;London Road&#x27; passes into Hounslow it again becomes &#x27;High Street&#x27;. In former times it was part of the &#x27;King&#x27;s Highway&#x27; to Windsor.

A bigger road was completed in 1925, named the Great West Road (A 4), moving in much the same direction and forming the notional northern boundary of Isleworth. A six-lane dual carriageway for most of its length, with attendant cycle paths, it fulfilled the purpose of bypassing the bottlenecks of Brentford and Hounslow high streets to relieve the old road from London of traffic heading to and from Windsor and beyond. A later branch extension off this new road, named the Great South West Road, carried traffic south-westwards and this had the additional effect of relieving the London Road of traffic heading to and from Staines-upon-Thames and beyond.

The other throughway in this category is the Twickenham Road (A 310), which branches off London Road west of the Syon estate and takes traffic to Twickenham, Teddington and beyond. This was the King&#x27;s Highway to Hampton Court, so in years past those houses fronting on Twickenham Road, such as Somerset House, Kendal House and the two Silver Halls would have been favoured with a royal gaze from time to time. 

===Bus and tram===

Horse bus operation came to Isleworth in the mid-1800s.
The predominant London bus operator from 1856 to 1933 was the London General Omnibus Company, after which the London Passenger Transport Board was formed. On 19 October 1856 the LGOC took over an existing horse bus operation between Isleworth and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with the buses painted red. 

Electric trams started running in Isleworth in 1901, from a depot situated on the north side of London Road, near the border with Hounslow. The original operating company was London United Tramways, which was subsumed into the new London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. In 1935 the depot was converted to trolleybus operation. It was designed in a horseshoe shape with a travelator at the far end, which had a turntable added for the trolleybuses. Originally known as Hounslow Depot, it was renamed Isleworth and given the code &quot;IH&quot; in 1950. It had a capacity for 37 vehicles and only ever operated one service: the 57 tram route which, on conversion, became the 657 trolleybus route. Both the 57 and 657 operated between Hounslow and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green via Isleworth, Brentford, Chiswick, and Goldhawk Road. From 1902 the Hounslow terminus of the 57 tram was the &quot;Hussar&quot; in Staines Road, Hounslow Heath. In July 1922 the service was cut back to terminate at the &quot;Bell&quot; at the western end of Hounslow High Street. A special turning place half a mile along Staines Road, at its junction with Wellington Road, was built for the 657 trolleybus. At different times there were ambitious plans to extend the tram lines westward to Staines-upon-Thames and even to Maidenhead, but these never came about and the modern replacement motor bus route 237 traverses exactly the same roads between Hounslow Heath and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush as the trams did over 110 years ago (with a short extension to White City). 

When the 657 figured in the final London trolleybus conversion of all, on 8 May 1962, Isleworth Depot was closed and its staff were transferred to nearby Hounslow Bus Garage (coded &quot;AV&quot;). The replacement motor bus service was provided by an extension of route 117, which up to then had run between Egham and Hounslow. In 1978 the 117 between Hounslow and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush was superseded by an eastward extension to route 237. Until this time the 237 had operated between Chertsey and Hounslow with single deck buses – a truly suburban route. As part of the privatisation of London bus services, Hounslow Garage passed to London United that later was purchased by Transdev and later over by the RATP Group.

Another trolleybus service serving Isleworth was the 667, formerly the 67 tram, which passed through en route from Hampton Court to Hammersmith via Hampton Hill, Fulwell, Twickenham, Busch Corner, Brentford and Chiswick. Upon its transfer to motor bus operation, as part of the final London trolleybus conversions, the route had its number changed from 667 to 267. Tram 67, trolleybus 667 and motor bus 267 were all operated from Fulwell bus garage. The history of the ownership of Fulwell (coded &quot;FW&quot;) is exactly as for Hounslow Garage above.

On Summer Bank Holidays a special service was operated between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Hampton Court. In tram days this was route 65, but trolleybuses showed number 667 towards Hampton Court and 657 on the return journey. This service did not survive the trolleybuses&#x27; withdrawal.

A long-established motor bus route serving Isleworth (and Hounslow) was the number 37. This was one of the earliest motor bus routes introduced by the London General Omnibus Company and it originally ran from Isleworth to Peckham via St Margarets, Richmond, Barnes, Putney, Wandsworth, Clapham Junction, Clapham Common, Brixton, Herne Hill and East Dulwich. It was later extended westward to Hounslow (going round the back streets to avoid the low railway bridge in St John&#x27;s Road and to serve Isleworth railway station) and for a brief time in the 1920s offered a summer Sunday service extension as far as Maidenhead. Even without that short-lived extension the 37 was one of London&#x27;s longest routes. Between 1922 and 1938 its western terminus was the &quot;Hussar&quot; at Hounslow Heath but was then cut back to turn at Hounslow Bus Garage (later Bus Station). At the beginning the terminus in Isleworth was the forecourt of the Northumberland Arms public house and the destination boards displayed &quot;ISLEWORTH Market Place&quot;. Later, for &quot;short&quot; journeys, this was changed to stands in Magdala Road and then in South Street, outside the Public Hall. In 1991 this historic route was curtailed to run between Peckham and Putney, and the section between Richmond and Hounslow via Isleworth became a new, more localised service numbered H37.

===Rail===
Isleworth has only one rail service. It consists of a loop branch line running off the minor main line service operated by South Western Railway between central London and Reading. On the down-service the loop begins at the Barnes junction, then travels through Chiswick and Brentford before entering Isleworth by crossing the River Brent just south of the A4 trunk road. Thereafter it serves the two stations of Syon Lane and Isleworth before leaving the town just north of the Woodlands estate and passing under Bridge Road. The service usually runs at fifteen-minute intervals. Following its next stop at Hounslow the loop re-enters the main line on the up-service shortly before the Whitton station.

==Notable residents==
*Peter Oliver (1594–1648), watercolour copyist and miniature portrait artist, lived in his native Isleworth. He painted many figures at the courts of Kings James I and Charles I.
*Marina Dellap was a resident of Isleworth in 1765. She was enslaved and lived in the home of Mrs Dellap near All Saints’ Church in Isleworth. She ran away on 26 May 1765. Marina was in her 20s, had arrived from Jamaica about a year before, spoke English and had a child. She was a skilled seamstress. It is likely that Marina arrived in England with Elizabeth Bouffan after the death of her husband Alexander Dellap, with whom they lived in St Catherine, Jamaica.
*Prince was a resident of Isleworth in 1765. He was enslaved by a merchant called Mr Shea. Prince was aged 24, from Guinea and a musician who played the French horn. Prince ran away from Mr Shea on 13 August 1765 and is likely to have known Marina Dellap. She was seen with someone matching Prince’s description (wearing an old brown livery coat turned up with red).
*In 1779, Sir Joseph Banks, botanist, took a lease on, and eventually bought, a house with along the northern side of what is now London Road. It became known as &quot;Spring Grove House&quot;. Although he also had a home in central London, he spent much time and effort on his Isleworth property. He steadily created a renowned botanical masterpiece on the estate, achieved primarily with many of the great variety of foreign plants he had collected on his great travels around the world, particularly with Captain Cook to Australia and the South Seas. Banks died in 1820, and over the next thirty years the house was considerably modified and enlarged by a new owner, Henry Pownall, who then sold the estate in 1850 for partial redevelopment.
*In 1804, J. M. W. Turner lived for a short time in Sion Ferry House in Isleworth, where he drew inspiration from the picturesque banks of the River Thames. His paintings thereafter include the Houses of Parliament and Hampton Court from the Thames.
*Ian Gilmour, who became 3rd Baronet of Craigmillar, was Secretary of State for Defence and Lord Privy Seal during the 1970s. He lived at the current Ferry House, on the same site as above, for fifty-three years until his death in 2007.

He rebuilt it in 1892/94 on a grander scale, retaining the structure, facing the building with new red brickwork, and adding large rear extensions. This created a sizeable mansion, most of which still stands. The house is now part of West Thames College. There is a memorial to the Pears family in Isleworth cemetery, including Thomas Pears (1882–1912) who died on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.
*George Manville Fenn (1831-1909) was a prolific English novelist, journalist, editor and educationalist who lived in Isleworth and is buried there. Many of his novels were written for young adults.

===Notable houses===

A period of intense mansion-building occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries. There was a triple attraction to the area in those times. Its rural, waterside beauty had become well recognised over two hundred years or so, and a few palaces, monasteries and mansions already existed. Then the royal court began to appear at Kew, so the adjacent districts on both sides of the Thames became very fashionable places for the rich and famous to build their grand homes. Some of the cachet dropped away when the court eventually left Kew; most high-quality here survived well The Blitz and social turmoil to enable many to reach grade II* (the mid category) of architectural listed building.

*Syon House Duke of Somerset Duke of Northumberland. (standing, listed Grade 1) Although this grand house has had a close connection with Isleworth for 450 years, it has very grand architecture as the only non-royal ducal main home (&#x27;seat&#x27;) in Middlesex. It is chronicled in an exhaustive history.

*Silver Hall No. 1 &quot;(South of North Street, with four acres)&quot; [1.6 hectares] Sir John Smith Bt, Privy to William &amp; Mary  Lady Harcourt, widow of Sir W Harcourt, Chancellor (Demolished 1801)
*Silver Hall No. 2 &quot;(North of North Street)&quot; Joseph Dixon. (Demolished 1950)
*Kendal House. &quot;(Twickenham Road, near Mill Plat)&quot; Duchess of Kendal (mistress to George I).
*Somerset House
*Gunnersbury House. &quot;(At the junction of Bridge Road and London Road)&quot; (Demolished c. 1972).
*Isleworth House Sir William Cooper, chaplain to George III. Renamed Nazareth House in 1892 when it was established as the present residential nursing home and convent. (standing)
*Countess of Charleville&#x27;s Villa Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais (Campbell), Countess of Charleville.
*Wyke House
*Little Syon (formerly Cromwell House) Sir Richard Wynn Bt. (Demolished 1818).

*Gumley House John Gumley (Commissary-General to the Army)  The Earl of Bath (Gumley&#x27;s son-in-law)  General Lord Lake.
*Shrewsbury House George Talbot, 14th Earl of Shrewsbury
Shrewsbury House lay to the east of Upper Square, in the area known as Lion Wharf, once Beck&#x27;s Wharf, also Shrewsbury Wharf. The 14th Earl inherited the lease in 1719 and later by Act of Parliament gained full rights to the property (in exchange for certain fee-farm rents) from an almshouse charity established by a former landlord, Sir Thomas Ingram, from whom the 1st Duke of Shrewsbury had originally leased the site. Around 1778 the 14th Earl started the process by which the house converted to a school for boys of Roman Catholic parents.

*Gordon House, by the River Thames at Railshead Rd. (standing, listed Grade II*). General Humphrey Bland  Lord James Hay Lord John Kennedy-Erskine. Lord and Lady Frederick Gordon  Earl of Kilmorey Judge T C Haliburton MP. In Lord Hay&#x27;s time this was named &#x27;Seaton House&#x27;, after his ancestral home in Aberdeenshire. It was next bought by King William IV at 8,000 guineas for his (illegitimate) daughter Lady Augusta, who married Lord John Kennedy-Erskine of Dun, the son of the First Marquis of Ailsa who lived next door in St Margaret&#x27;s House. Gordon House is being renovated.
*Spring Grove House Sir Joseph Banks Andrew Pears. (standing, Grade II)
: In 1862 Francis Pears decided to expand his soap making business and bought land alongside the London Road for a factory. Another, larger, factory was opened along the opposite side of the road in the 1880s and soap was made on the site until 1962. His son Andrew bought the Spring Grove House estate in 1886 and greatly extended the house in 1894. &quot;Pictures are shown under &#x27;Notable residents&#x27;.&quot;

*Keppel House First Lord of the Admiralty Augustus Keppel.
*Lacy House A 17th-century house rebuilt in 1750 for James Lacy, of Drury Lane Theatre.Lacy&#x27;s son inherited the property but his extravagance compelled him to sell the house, to the Hon. Sir Edward Walpole K.B. He bequeathed it to his daughter, widow of Bishop of Exeter, and after that it was acquired by the Earl of Warwick. After him came the famous playwright Richard Sheridan, who by then had already produced his two masterpieces &quot;School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Rivals&quot;. Lacy House was demolished in the 1830s.
*St Margaret&#x27;s House (Lacy House rebuilt and renamed) First Marquis of Ailsa.
*Kilmorey House (replaced St Margarets House in 1853). Built for 2nd Earl of Kilmorey but never lived in. Became the Royal Naval School for Girls (1856–1940). (Demolished 1950).

<text>Kennington is a district in south London, England. It is mainly within the London Borough of Lambeth, running along the boundary with the London Borough of Southwark, a boundary which can be discerned from the early medieval period between the Lambeth and St George&#x27;s parishes of those boroughs respectively. It is located south of Charing Cross in Inner London and is identified as a local centre in the London Plan. It was a royal manor in the parish of St Mary, Lambeth in the county of Surrey and was the administrative centre of the parish from 1853. Proximity to central London was key to the development of the area as a residential suburb and it was incorporated into the metropolitan area of London in 1855.

Kennington is the location of three significant London landmarks: the Oval cricket ground, the Imperial War Museum, and Kennington Park. Its population at the United Kingdom Census 2011 was 15,106.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Kennington appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Chenintune&quot;. It is recorded as &quot;Kenintone&quot; in 1229 and &quot;Kenyngton&quot; in 1263. Mills (2001) believes the name to be Old English meaning &quot;farmstead or estate associated with a man called Cēna&quot;. Another explanation is that it means &quot;place of the King&quot;, or &quot;town of the King&quot;.

===Early history===
The presence of a tumulus, and other locally significant geographical features, suggest that the area was regarded in ancient times as a sacred place of assembly. According to the Domesday Book it was held by Teodric (Theodoric) the Goldsmith. It contained: 1 hide and 3 virgates; 3 ploughs, of meadow. It rendered £3 annually. The manor of Kennington was divided from the manor of Vauxhall by the River Effra, a tributary of the River Thames. A smaller river, the River Neckinger, ran along the edge of the northern part of Kennington, approximately where Brook Drive is today (i.e. the brook) still forming the borough boundary. Both rivers have now been diverted into underground culverts.
Edward III gave the manor of Kennington to his oldest son Edward the Black Prince in 1337, and the prince then built a large royal palace in the triangle formed by Kennington Lane, Sancroft Street and Cardigan Street, near to Kennington Cross. In 1377, according to John Stow, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster came to Kennington to escape the fury of the people of London. Geoffrey Chaucer was employed at Kennington as Clerk of Works in 1389. He was paid 2 shillings. Kennington was the occasional residence of Henry IV and Henry VI. Henry VII was at Kennington before his coronation. Catherine of Aragon stayed at Kennington Palace in 1501. In 1531, at the order of King Henry VIII, most of Kennington Palace was dismantled, and the materials were used in the construction of the Palace of Whitehall.

The historical manor of Kennington continues to be owned by the current monarch&#x27;s elder son (the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall: see Dukes of Cornwall). The Duchy of Cornwall maintains a substantial property portfolio within the area.

===18th century===

The eighteenth century saw considerable development in Kennington. At the start of the century, the area was essentially a village on the southern roads into London, with a common on which public executions took place. On three dates in 1746, Francis Towneley and sixteen men who had taken part in the Jacobite rising were hanged, drawn and quartered at Kennington Common.

The area was significant enough, however, to be recognised in the Peerage of Great Britain and in 1726, the title Earl of Kennington was assumed by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland.

The development of Kennington came about through access to London, which happened when, in 1750, Westminster Bridge was constructed. In 1751, Kennington Road was built from Kennington Common (as it then was; now Kennington Park) to Westminster Bridge Road.

By the 1770s, the development of Kennington into its modern form was well underway. Terraces of houses were built on the east side of Kennington Road and Cleaver Square (then called Prince&#x27;s Square) was laid out in 1788. Michael Searles, architect and developer, built semi-detached houses along Kennington Park Road in the 1790s.

A fraudster from Camberwell, named Badger, was the last person to be hanged at Kennington Common, in 1799.

===19th century===
The modern street pattern of Kennington was formed by the early nineteenth century. The village had become a semi-rural suburb with grand terraced houses.

In the early nineteenth century, Kennington Common was a place of ill-repute. Various attempts were made by the Grand Surrey Canal to purchase the land to build a canal basin, but all of these failed. Because the area had been so rapidly developed and populated in the second half of the eighteenth century, by the nineteenth century, the Common was no longer used for grazing cattle and other agricultural purposes. It became a rubbish dump, a meeting place for radical crowds and an embarrassment to the area. Common rights were extinguished over one corner of the land and in 1824, St. Mark&#x27;s Church was built on the site of the gallows. One of the four &quot;Waterloo Churches&quot; of south London, the church was opened by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1852, at the initiative of the minister of St. Mark&#x27;s Church, the Common was enclosed and became the first public park in south London.
Pockets of land between the main roads were built upon in the early nineteenth century. Walcot Square and St Mary&#x27;s Gardens were laid out in the 1830s on land formerly used as a market garden. Imperial Court, on Kennington Lane, was built in 1836 for the Licensed Victuallers&#x27; School. The first stone was laid by Viscount Melbourne, in the name of King William IV.

The Oval cricket ground was leased to Surrey County Cricket Club from the Duchy of Cornwall in 1845, and the adjacent gasometers (themselves an international sporting landmark) were constructed in 1853.

Dense building and the carving-up of large houses for multiple occupation caused Kennington to be &quot;very seriously over-populated in 1859, when diphtheria appeared&quot; (recorded by Karl Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;).

The church of St John the Divine, Kennington, which was to be described by the poet John Betjeman as &quot;the most magnificent church in South London&quot;, was designed by George Edmund Street (architect of the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London), and was built between 1871 and 1874.

The Durning Library, at Kennington Cross, was designed in 1889 by S. Sidney R. J. Smith, architect of the Tate Gallery (as it then was; now Tate Britain), and is a fine example of the Gothic Revival style. The library was a gift to the people of Kennington from Jemina Durning Smith.

A men&#x27;s public convenience, which had been built opposite in 1898, is now preserved as an arts venue and is likely to have been used by a young Charlie Chaplin who writes in his autobiography of a night when he was locked out of the family room and listened all night to the music in the newly opened White Hart pub, now The Tommyfield. When his mother fell on hard times he was taken with his brother Sydney to another Kennington landmark the old Lambeth Workhouse now the home of the Cinema Museum.

Kennington station was opened as &quot;Kennington (New Street)&quot; in 1890 by the City of London and Southwark Subway, but is in fact on the boundary of Newington, Surrey and Kennington and as such is now in the London Borough of Southwark.

The poverty map of London, created by Charles Booth in 1898–99, identifies a mixture of classifications for the streets of the district; Kennington Park Road, for example, corresponds with the description &quot;Middle class. Well-to-do&quot;. Most streets are classified as &quot;Mixed. Some comfortable, others poor&quot;. There are also several scattered streets which are considered to be &quot;Poor. 18s. to 21s. a week for a moderate family&quot;. The map shows that there existed in the district a great disparity of wealth and comfort between near-neighbours.

===20th-century history===

Two social forces were at work in Kennington at different times during the twentieth century: decline, and – later – gentrification. Decline began in the early part of the twentieth century. Middle-class households ceased to employ servants and no longer sought the large houses of Kennington, preferring the suburbs of outer London. Houses in Kennington were suited to multiple occupation and were divided into flats and bedsits, providing cheap lodgings for lower-paid workers.

Kennington ceased to be the administrative centre for the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth (as it then was) in 1908. The Old Town Hall, built on Kennington Road as a vestry hall for the local parish, was not large enough for the Council to properly carry out its functions and a new town hall was built in Brixton. The Old Town Hall was the registered office of the Countryside Alliance until September 2015.

In 1913, Maud Pember Reeves selected Kennington for &quot;Round About a Pound a Week&quot;, which was a survey of social conditions in the district. She found &quot;respectable but very poor people [who] live over a morass of such intolerable poverty that they unite instinctively to save those known to them from falling into it&quot;.
In an initiative to improve the district, from 1915, the Duchy of Cornwall set about an ambitious project to redevelop land. Courtenay Square, Courtenay Street, Cardigan Street, Denny Street and Denny Crescent were laid out to a design by architects Stanley Davenport Adshead, Stanley Churchill Ramsay and JD Coleridge, in a Neo-Georgian style.

In 1922, Lambeth Hospital on Brook Drive was created from a former workhouse. Under the control of the London County Council, Lambeth Hospital, which had a capacity of 1,250 patients in 1939, was one of the largest hospitals in London. After the National Health Service was formed, Lambeth Hospital became an acute general hospital. In 1976, the North Wing of St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital opened; services transferred there, and Lambeth Hospital was closed. A substantial part of the site has today been redeveloped for apartments, although some buildings are occupied by the Lambeth Community Care Centre.

Kennington station was substantially remodelled in 1925 to accommodate the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line along with the improvements to the City and South London Railway to form the Northern line. Because tram and bus routes converged at Kennington, in the 1920s St. Mark&#x27;s became known as the &quot;tramwayman&#x27;s church&quot;, and Kennington was referred to as the &quot;Clapham Junction of the southern roads&quot;.

By 1926, construction of the Belgrave Hospital for Children, designed by Henry Percy Adams and Charles Holden, was complete. The hospital was subsumed within the King&#x27;s College Hospital Group and closed in 1985. It was restored and converted to apartments in 1994.

In the 1930s, the Duchy of Cornwall continued to redevelop its estate in the district and employed architect Louis de Soissons to design a number of buildings in a Neo-Georgian style.

On 15 October 1940, the large trench air-raid shelter beneath Kennington Park was struck by a 50 lb bomb. The number of people killed remains unknown; it is believed by local historians that 104 people died. Forty-eight bodies were recovered.

The Brandon Estate was endowed in 1962 by the London County Council with &quot;Reclining Figure No. 3&quot;: a sculpture by Henry Moore.

St Agnes Place was a street of mid-Victorian terraces built for the servants of Buckingham Palace. Lambeth Council had decided to demolish the street to extend Kennington Park and the houses were empty by the late 1960s. In 1969, squatters moved into one of the houses and later entered the other empty properties and established a Rastafari temple. The street became London&#x27;s longest-running squat. From 1977, Lambeth Council sought to evict the squatters and eventually succeeded at the High Court in 2005. The houses and the temple were declared to be unfit for human habitation and were pulled down in 2007. The Kennington Park Extension now covers much of the site.

Lambeth Council designated much of Kennington a Conservation Area in 1968, the boundary of which was extended in 1979 and in 1997. Lambeth Council&#x27;s emphasis on conserving and protecting Kennington&#x27;s architectural heritage and enhancing its attractive open spaces for recreation and leisure is illustrated by restoration of the centre of the listed Cleaver Square in the last decade of the twentieth century. Originally grassed over in the 1790s, the centre of Cleaver Square had by the 1870s become a garden circumscribed by a formal path, but by 1898 it had been cultivated as a nursery with greenhouses. In 1927 the centre of Cleaver Square was acquired by the London County Council to forestall a proposal to build on it, and more trees were then planted and the garden was gravelled over as a recreation ground. During the war years, in particular, the recreation area became somewhat derelict but during the 1950s Cleaver Square&#x27;s inherent charm was recognised anew and its fortunes once more began to rise. In 1995, Lambeth Council resolved, with the backing of English Heritage, a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and donations from residents of Cleaver Square, to restore the centre of the square to provide once again an attractive and peaceful public space for the people of Kennington. In the summer months many people from Kennington and further afield play pétanque in the centre of the square.

===21st-century gentrification===
In recent years, Kennington has experienced gentrification, principally because of its location and good transport links to the West End and the City of London. In &quot;London: A Social History&quot;, Roy Porter describes how &quot;Victorian villas in ... Kennington, long debased by use as lodging-houses, were transformed into luxury flats for young professionals or snips for first-time buyers – or were repossessed by the class of family for whom they had first been built&quot;; and &quot;Chambers London Gazetteer&quot; observes the &quot;reuniting of formerly subdivided properties&quot; as &quot;decline is being reversed&quot;.

It is difficult to identify a single defining reason for this change. The principal factors are location and transport. The good architectural and structural quality of many properties in Kennington – characterised by Georgian and Victorian terraces of yellow London stock brick, typically three storeys or higher, fronting the main roads and squares – has unquestionably contributed to the gentrification of the area. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of housing in the area is council-owned, including some council estates adjacent to Kennington Lane, leading up to Elephant and Castle, and around the Kennington Park area. In the twenty-first century there has been an ongoing programme by Lambeth Council of upgrading its stock of housing and in many cases improving its external appearance. The area&#x27;s varied social texture demonstrates the population mix.

==Governance==
The local authority is Lambeth London Borough Council.

Kennington is a standalone ward itself represented by three Labour Party councillors. 
Council elections take place every four years, with the next one scheduled in 2026. 

The Member of Parliament for the Vauxhall constituency, which includes Kennington, is currently the Labour Co-operative MP Florence Eshalomi, who has been the MP since December 2019. It is within the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency.

==Geography==
Kennington has no official boundaries but the ancient manorial boundaries are easily discerned and for historical purposes, this article has confined itself to them although estate agents use the term more loosely so as to promote any particular property they wish to act in disposal of, and modern classifications of which areas fall within the district vary. The modern layout of Kennington reflects development as a linear settlement. Within the London post town, the postcode district for Kennington is SE11. The SE11 postcode captures most of the district, although the peripheries of Kennington are within the SE17, SE1, SW8 and SW9 postcodes. The south-western part of the district – Kennington Oval – protrudes towards Vauxhall.

Nearest places: Vauxhall, Waterloo, Walworth, Newington (usually known as Elephant and Castle), Stockwell, Camberwell, Brixton, and Lambeth North.

==Culture and community==
Kennington is essentially a multi-ethnic area with a mixed and varied population, all falling within different geodemographic strands. The area attracts young and affluent incomers who fall within the ABC1 demographic strand of the NRS social grade spectrum.


Kennington is within the Division bell zone for the Houses of Parliament. This means that, at least in theory, it is within eight minutes from the division lobbies of the Houses of Parliament. A large number of members of parliament and civil servants live within the area. An article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described Kennington as &quot;the politicians&#x27; enclave across the Thames from Westminster&quot;; and &quot;The Times&quot; observed that &quot;Kennington ... is the suburb that has featured the most in the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal. Hazel Blears and Alistair Darling are only two of the ministers with Kennington second homes&quot;.

Kennington Road and Kennington Lane, south of Kennington Cross, could properly be described as the &quot;shopping area&quot; of Kennington. This area is identified as a &quot;Local Centre&quot; in the London Plan. There is a range of local shops, restaurants, cafés and estate agents, and there is a post office.

==Landmarks==

===Kennington Park===

Kennington Park, laid out by Victorian architect James Pennethorne, and St Mark&#x27;s Churchyard now cover the site of Kennington Common. The Park was originally designated one of the Royal Parks of London (today, management of the Park is undertaken by Lambeth Council).

The Park, historically, was a place for executions, a Speakers&#x27; Corner for public gatherings for political and religious purposes, and a place for entertainment and sporting events.

In the 1730s, Methodists John Wesley and George Whitefield preached to thousands on Kennington Common. In 1746 the Surrey County Gallows at the southern end of the Common was used for the execution of nine leaders of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. The Common was also where the Chartists gathered for their biggest demonstration in 1848. &quot;The Gymnastic Society&quot; met regularly at Kennington Common during the second half of the eighteenth century to play football. The Society – sometimes claimed to be the world&#x27;s first football club – consisted of London-based natives of Cumberland and Westmorland.

The tradition of political gathering at Kennington Park in advance of marches upon Parliament returned in the 1970s. In 1986, the Park was the location for the Gay Pride march of that year, and for several years thereafter. On 31 March 1990, some 200,000 people amassed at Kennington Park to march upon Trafalgar Square, in protest against the Community Charge. This, during the course of the day, escalated into mass disturbances: the Poll Tax Riots. In April 1997, a march organised by Reclaim the Streets set off from the Park for central London; and in May 2004, the Park was the starting point for a march to the Cannabis Festival at Brockwell Park. In March 2007, the Archbishop of Canterbury preached at Kennington Park to mark the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807. The Park had been a significant location for important anti-slave trade rallies. In March 2011, the Park was the South London starting point for a feeder march to the 2011 anti-cuts protest in London. In November 2012, the Park was the location of the &quot;Demo 2012&quot; student rally against higher tuition fees.

===Kennington Oval (The Oval)===


The Oval, officially currently rebranded as &quot;The Kia Oval&quot;, is the home ground for Surrey County Cricket Club and hosts the final Test match of the English summer season. The Oval was the first ground in the United Kingdom to host Test cricket, was the location for the England v Scotland representative matches, the first ever international football match, the first FA Cup final in 1872, and held the second ever rugby union international match between England and Scotland in 1872. England&#x27;s unfortunate performance against Australia here in 1882 gave rise to The Ashes. The Oval has been labelled with the sobriquet &quot;the Grand Old Lady&quot; in recognition of the significant role the ground has played in the development of modern sport.

The presence of the Oval as a large green space available for cricket is down to an unrealised street plan. For many years prior to its use as a cricket ground, this area was used as a cabbage garden.

===Stane Street===
Kennington Park Road, which continues beyond Kennington as Clapham Road, is a long and straight stretch of road because it follows the old Roman Stane Street. This ran down from the Roman London Bridge to Chichester via the gap in the North Downs at Box Hill near Dorking. Another Roman road branched off opposite Kennington Road and went through what is now Kennington Park and down the Brixton Road. It carried on through the North Downs near Caterham to Hassocks, just north of the South Downs.

<doc id="94129" wikidata="Q5638985" url="?curid=94129" title="Haida mythology">
<text>The Haida are one of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. Their national territories lie along the west coast of Canada and include parts of south east Alaska. Haida mythology is an indigenous religion that can be described as a nature religion, drawing on the natural world, seasonal patterns, events and objects for questions that the Haida pantheon provides explanations for. Haida mythology is also considered animistic for the breadth of the Haida pantheon in imbuing daily events with .

There are innumerable Haida supernatural beings, or , including prominent animal crests, wind directions, and legendary ancestors. John R. Swanton, while documenting Haida beliefs as part of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition recorded that the highest being in all Haida mythology and the one who gave power to the was , translated as &#x27;Power-of-the-Shining-Heavens&#x27;. Some have the ability to transform between animal and human forms while others do not. In the art creatures can sometimes be found with anthropomorphic features, especially human faces, inside or as part of their bodies denoting this transformative ability.

== Raven ==
Within Haida mythology, Raven is a central character, as he is for many of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas; &quot;see Raven Tales&quot;. While frequently described as a &quot;trickster&quot;, Haidas believe Raven, or to be a complex reflection of one&#x27;s own self. Raven can be a magician, a transformer, a potent creative force, ravenous debaucher but always a cultural hero. He is responsible for creating Haida Gwaii, releasing the sun from its tiny box and making the stars and the moon. In one story he released the first humans from a clamshell on the beach; in another story, he brought the first humans up out of the ground because he needed to fill up a party he was throwing. Raven stories on one level teach listeners how to live a good life, but usually by counterexample. Raven has been described as the greediest, most lecherous and mischievous creature known to the Haida, but at the same time Raven often helps humans in our encounters with other supernatural beings. Raven acquired such things as freshwater, salmon and the house for humans. Robert Bringhurst has noted that Raven never actually creates anything; he made the world by stealing, exchanging, redistributing, and generally moving things around.

== Other figures ==
 and are death gods among the Haida. rules violent death, while rules peaceful death. , a woman associated with frogs and volcanoes, and her husband, (bear god), arrived at the homeland of the Haida from the Pacific Ocean along with six canoes full of people. is a kindly forest goddess. is an invisible spirit who helped the Haida discover the uses of iron. Shamans could speak with &#x27;s voice by clenching their teeth.

Some of the mythology has been collected by poet Anne Cameron, who created interpretations for adults and children. Epic versions of the mythology by 19th century Haida storyteller-poets Skaay and Ghandl have been translated by Robert Bringhurst, whose &quot;Story as Sharp as a Knife&quot;, a collection of their works, won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. His translations, though, are controversial in Haida circles and some have charged him with cultural appropriation.

== Contemporary artwork ==
Robert Davidson has incorporated , Southeast Wind, in a variety of media including a 2002 serigraph print, as the solitary being in a 2010 totem pole, and as the main being on a 2015 cedar panel. As recently as 2019 Davidson released a serigraph print titled &quot;Supernatural Beings&quot; showing five unnamed inscribed within a Chilkat robe.

In 2019, Terri-Lynn Williams-Davidson, alongside her stepdaughter Sara Florence Davidson, published a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Magical Beings of Haida Gwaii&quot;, which features ten supernatural beings of ancient Haida storytelling and presents them in a visual medium. The book engages children and teaches them empowering and meaningful examples of living in balance with nature.

<doc id="94132" wikidata="Q147120" url="?curid=94132" title="Kensal Green">
<text>Kensal Green, also known as Kensal Rise, is an area in north-west London, and along with Kensal Town, it forms part of the northern section of North Kensington. It lies north of the canal in the London Borough of Brent, and also to the south, within Kensington and Chelsea. Kensal Green is located on the Harrow Road, about miles from Charing Cross.

To the west on Harrow Road lies Harlesden, while in the opposite direction are Maida Hill and Westbourne. Queens Park and Brondesbury are to the north-east, Willesden is to the north-west, and Notting Hill lies to the south.

Kensal Green is best known for the Grade I listed Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Residents and businesses==
As of June 2014, the area had seen significant gentrification, attracting people from surrounding areas such as Notting Hill and Queen&#x27;s Park. It was characterised by numerous independent stores, restaurants, pubs and cafes, and was earning a reputation as a &quot;celebrity haunt-meets-Nappy Valley.&quot;

In 2009, Chamberlayne Road in Kensal Rise was named the &quot;hippest street in Europe&quot; by &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. Luxury goods maker Mulberry named its handbag Kensal and launched an advertising campaign with Cara Delevingne. The area is characterised by numerous independent stores, restaurants, pubs, and cafes. There are also various sports clubs, gyms and health studios such as Moberly Sports Centre and Gracelands Yard, as well as nearby Queens Park. The area also boasts Britain&#x27;s first independent boutique cinema and social enterprise, The Lexi Cinema. It is staffed by local volunteers and its profits go to an eco-village in South Africa.

It has been home to a number of residents including musicians Paloma Faith and Rita Ora, chef Thomasina Miers, film director, DJs and musicians Don Letts and Mark Rae, actress Thandiwe Newton, singer Lily Allen, model-turned-author Sophie Dahl, author Zadie Smith, David Cameron&#x27;s ex-strategy guru Steve Hilton, the actor and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sienna Miller.

It has traditionally been popular with those working in the media and creative industries but those buying properties increasingly include people working in the financial and technology industries, and others moving from nearby Notting Hill in search of more space. The area also attracts Americans thanks to The American School in London in neighbouring St John&#x27;s Wood, as well as being popular with the French, partly due to a Lycée Français opening in Brent&#x27;s former town hall.

==Community==
In 2014 residents successfully campaigned to save its local library after it was sold to a developer. More recently, independent local cinema Lexi raised £141,000 from locals and local businesses for a community hub. The hub was also supported by Brent Council and the Mayor of London.

In 2021 residents of Clifford Gardens successfully campaigned against the asphalting of pavements. They set up a petition and managed to get 544 signatures in a week. When the workmen arrived with lorries and rollers on 20 March they were met by a large crowd of parents with children and buggies blockading the street.

== Open space and public realm ==
Emslie Horniman&#x27;s Pleasance Park located on Bosworth Road contains tennis courts, five-a-side football pitches and children&#x27;s playground. Queens Park features tennis courts, golf, a petting zoo and an extensive children&#x27;s playground. 
King Edwards Vll park is within walking distance.

Brent Council announced planned improvements to the public realm in 2019 to enhance the pedestrian experience and reduce traffic. The changes include new cycle lanes, various measures to reduce congestion and an improved public realm with new pavements, carriageway resurfacing, community greening schemes and pocket gardens.

== Transport ==
Kensal Green station (Transport for London Travelcard Zone 2) on the Bakerloo line is about 20 minutes from Oxford Circus and the West End. National Rail London Overground services also operate to London Euston, a journey that takes around 15 minutes. Trains also go to .

London Overground&#x27;s North London Line services also operate out of Kensal Rise railway station (Transport for London Travelcard Zone 2) and provides regular services to Richmond in the west, Stratford in the east, and Clapham Junction in the south.

Extensive bus services also run from the area, including routes 18 (Sudbury - Euston), 6 (Willesden Bus Garage - Aldwych), 52 (Willesden Bus Garage - Victoria station via Notting Hill and Kensington) and 452 (Kensal Rise - Vauxhall).

Kensal Green is located on the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal (which passes by Kensal Green Cemetery) making it possible to walk and cycle along the canal to Little Venice, the Paddington Basin, Paddington Station and Regents Canal.

In 2020 the Government gave final approval to the High Speed 2 (HS2) train link running from London to Birmingham. This will bring a major HS2 and Crossrail interchange station at Old Oak Common, within walking distance from Kensal Green. It is expected to open in 2026 and will provide high-speed rail across London and to the Midlands, as well as direct connectivity with the Heathrow Express airport rail link and trains to Wales and the West of England. It will be the largest new railway station ever built in the UK.

==Schools==

The educational charity Ark, founded by venture capitalist Arpad Busson, runs three state primary schools in the area, including Ark Franklin in Harvist Road, which replaced Kensal Rise primary in September 2013. In 2024 Ark Franklin received a letter from the Minister of Education congratulating the school for being in the top 2% for early years performance. As of 2020, the following state primary schools are judged to be “good”: Ark Franklin; Princess Frederica CofE in College Road; and Kenmont Primary School in Valliere Road which was built in 1883–84 to a design by the architect by Edward Robert Robson for the School Board for London and has been Grade II listed since 1984.

Three state comprehensive schools are judged to be “good”, including Queens Park Community School in Aylestone Avenue, and Capital City Academy in Doyle Gardens.

There is a small choice of local private schools. The primary schools are Seacole (co-ed, ages four to 11) in Bosworth Road and The Lloyd Williamson School (co-ed, six weeks to 11) in Telford Road. Bales College is a very small independent co-ed secondary school and sixth form college, catering for ages 11 to 20 on Harrow Road. Many parents use the private schools in nearby Belsize Park and Hampstead.

== Kensal Green Cemetery ==

Kensal Green Cemetery is the first of the &#x27;Magnificent Seven&#x27; cemeteries in London. It is the resting place of members of the royal family, including Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, and scores of figures in history including Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Charles Babbage, and William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland. 
Architects buried there include, Decimus Burton, Philip Charles Hardwick, and John Shaw Jr.
From the Arts are playwright, Harold Pinter, actor Mario Fabrizi, William Makepeace Thackery, and Anthony Trollope.
The family plot of engineers Marc Brunel and Isambard Kingdom Brunel is also here.
Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, actor Alan Rickman, and actress Ingrid Bergman were cremated in the West London Crematorium, which is located within the grounds of the cemetery.

Cemetery directors and The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery (a charity) lobbied the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage for funding to help preserve historical monuments at the site. The 2015 project, which involved repairs to the grade one listed Anglican Chapel and the boundary wall, was estimated to have cost more than £10m.

The cemetery is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Many buildings and memorials are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as listed buildings.

== History ==
Originally part of one of the 8 manors within the district of Willesden, 
Kensal Green is first mentioned in 1253, translating from old English meaning &quot;the King&#x27;s Holt&quot; (King&#x27;s Wood). Its location marked the boundary between Willesden and the then Chelsea &amp; Paddington, on which it remains today. It formed part of one of 10 manors, most likely Chamberlayne Wood Manor, named after Canon Richard de Camera (&quot;of the Chambers&quot;). In the 15th century the then Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Chichele (1414–1443), acquired lands in Willesden and Kingsbury. In 1443 he founded All Souls&#x27; College, Oxford and endowed it with the same lands in his will. As a result, most of Willesden and Kensal Green remained largely agricultural until the mid-1800s, well into the Victorian era. In 1805, the construction of the Grand Junction Canal passed through the district to join the Regent&#x27;s Canal at Paddington. As the combined Grand Union Canal, this allowed passage of commercial freight traffic from the Midlands to London Docks, and hence onwards to the River Thames. There were two dairy farms in Kensal Green by the early 1800s, which expanded greatly after the 1864 Act of Parliament which made it illegal to keep cattle within the City of London. Although by the late 1800s residential development had greatly reduced the farmland, still in the 1890s many sheep and pigs were raised in the district. One of the farms later became a United Dairies creamery, supplied by milk trains from Mitre Bridge Junction.

St. John&#x27;s Church was built on the corner of what is now Harrow Road and Kilburn Lane in 1844 and was extensively refurbished in 2017 and fitted with new bells in anticipation of the 175th anniversary in 2019. The church was followed by a school, now Bales College, and more inns including The Plough on the opposite corner of the junction. In 1832 Kensal Green Cemetery was incorporated by Act of Parliament and opened in January 1833. This led to a revaluation of the surrounding lands, and in 1835 ecclesiastical commissioners were appointed by the Crown, who reported in 1846 that: &quot;the larger portion of the Prebendal Estates possess, in our opinion, a value far beyond their present agricultural value.&quot;

With enough people living locally to create a new parish, in 1844 St. John the Evangelist Church in Kilburn Lane was consecrated. The 1851 census records just over 800 people living in the new parish. In the 1860s, Kensal Green manor house, situated where Wakeman Road joins Harrow Road, was demolished. Rapid increase in residential development followed, firstly with land west of Kilburn High Road, followed by the sale of Banister&#x27;s Farm leading to the development of Bannister Road and Mortimer Road. Unfortunately at this time Kensal Green was suffering huge social problems and had a reputation of being a slum, with 55% off its residents living in poverty and squalor, despite being neighbours to thriving Queen&#x27;s Park.The rapid residential development led to local commissioners reporting in 1880 that there was inadequate drainage and sewerage facilities, with most houses having only improved access to what were the old agricultural drains. In that same year, All Souls&#x27; College started to develop its lands north-west of Kilburn Lane, including All Souls&#x27; Avenue and College Road, with adjacent roads being named after leading Fellows of the college, and the installation of new sewerage facilities across the district. The college donated lands on which to build Kensal Rise Reading Room, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, in 1897. Opened by American author Mark Twain in 1901, it was later extended and renamed Kensal Rise Library.

The developments of the streets around Kensal Rise railway station date from the last 10 years of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. Although opened in April 1873 as Kensal Green at Chamberlayne Wood, then a remote dead end road; it was renamed Kensal Rise on 24 May 1890. Just north of the station the National Athletic Ground (one of the many early grounds of Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers) opened in 1890. The ground which was later renamed the Kensal Rise Athletic Stadium also hosted cycling and athletics competitions before being turned over to housing in the 1920s. For a brief period before 1914 the Aeroplane Building and Flying Society had its headquarters at Kensal Rise and flew test gliders from the site. Kensal Green also boasted the Electric Pavilion Cinema which opened in November 1914 and was located on the corner of Chamberlayne Road and Bannister Road.

The construction of the Great Western Railway started in 1835, with the first of line, from Paddington station to Maidenhead Bridge station, opened on 4 June 1838. In 1901, its major carriage washing and servicing facilities and locomotive depot were developed at Old Oak Common, bringing further employment and more immigrants to the district. The first major immigrant population had been Irish people fleeing the Great Irish Famine, and then post-World War I. In World War II, due to the railway facilities, the district suffered greatly from German Luftwaffe bombing.

After the war, the area became a refuge for the first Afro-Caribbean born contingent. In the 1960s the college disposed of many freeholds, while retaining land in Willesden. Since the 1980s, the Irish-born community has reduced in size, although the legacy of their presence remains, not least in the number of Irish pubs and organisations and the many thousands with Irish ancestry who continue to populate the area. According to statistics from the 2001 census, the area has a very high proportion of young residents (28.4% 25–44 years old) and a very high educational level (30.7% hold a first degree or better).

As of June 2014 the area had seen significant gentrification as people had been priced out of surrounding areas such as Notting Hill. In 2015 it was described as &#x27;celebrity haunt-meets-Nappy Valley&#x27;.

==Demographics==
The largest ethnic group in Kensal Green ward according to the 2011 census was White British, 26%. The second largest was White other, 18%, followed by Black Caribbean, 12%. Neighbouring Queen&#x27;s Park ward, which also covers eastern areas of Kensal Green, was 30% White British. The College Park ward, which covers the southern areas of Kensal Green, was 31.6% white British, 18.4% White other and 21.1% Black. Kensal Green ward has the highest Latin American population in London.

== Tornado on 7 December 2006 ==

On 7 December 2006 at 11.00 am, a tornado struck Kensal Green. Up to 150 houses were damaged, and six people were injured, one requiring hospital attention. Residential roads were closed off and residents had to seek temporary accommodation. Traffic was also diverted, causing disruption. The cost of the damage was estimated to be at least £2 million.

<text>Kentish Town is an area of northwest London, England, in the London Borough of Camden, immediately north of Camden Town, close to Hampstead Heath. 

Kentish Town likely derives its name from Ken-ditch or Caen-ditch, meaning the &quot;bed of a waterway.&quot; The area was initially a small settlement on the River Fleet, first recorded in 1207 during King John&#x27;s reign. The early 19th century brought modernization to the area, and it became a popular resort due to its accessibility from London. Notably, Karl Marx resided at 46 Grafton Terrace in Kentish Town from 1856.

The area saw further development after World War II and has a rich history of political representation, with the Holborn and St Pancras seat held by Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer as of July 2024. Kentish Town has also been a popular filming location for various movies and television shows. It is home to numerous independently owned shops, music venues, and cultural establishments, such as the Kentish Town Community Centre.

==Toponymy==
The name of Kentish Town is probably derived from &quot;Ken-ditch&quot; or &quot;Caen-ditch&quot;, meaning the &quot;bed of a waterway&quot; and is otherwise unrelated to the English county of Kent. In researching the meaning of &quot;Ken-ditch&quot;, it has also been noted that &quot;ken&quot; is the Celtic word for both &quot;green&quot; and &quot;river&quot;, while &quot;ditch&quot; refers to the River Fleet, now a subterranean river. However, another theory is the name comes from its position near the Fleet; it has been suggested that Kentish Town, which lies in between two forks of the Fleet, takes its name from &quot;cant&quot; or &quot;cantle&quot; (from the Middle English meaning &quot;corner&quot;).

==History==
Kentish Town was originally a small settlement on the River Fleet (the waterway is now one of London&#x27;s underground rivers). It is first recorded during the reign of King John (1207) as &quot;kentisston&quot;. By 1456 Kentish Town was a thriving hamlet. In this period, a chapel of ease was built for its inhabitants.

The early 19th century brought modernisation, causing much of the area&#x27;s rural qualities, the River Fleet and the 18th-century buildings to vanish, although pockets still remain, for example Little Green Street. Between the availability of public transport to it from London, and its urbanisation, it was a popular resort.
Large amounts of land were purchased to build the railway, which can still be seen today. Kentish Town was a prime site for development as the Kentish Town Road was a major route from London northwards. Karl Marx was a famous resident, living at 46 Grafton Terrace from 1856. Jenny Marx described this eight-room house in Kentish Town as &quot;A truly princely dwelling, compared with the holes we used to live in&quot; (March 11, 1861 letter by Jenny Marx, quoted in Rachel Holmes, &quot;Eleanor Marx: A Life&quot;, Bloomsbury Books, London, 2014,P 10).

1877 saw the beginning of mission work in the area as it was then poor. The mission first held their services outside but as their funding increased they built a mission house, chapel, and vicarage. One mission house of the area was Lyndhurst Hall which remained in use before being taken over by the Council. The Council wished it to sell it for residential use, and the hall was demolished in 2006.

During the 19th century and early 20th century the area of Kentish Town became the home of several piano and organ manufacturers, and was described by The Piano Journal in 1901 as &quot;...that healthful suburb dear to the heart of the piano maker&quot;.

A network of streets in the East of Kentish Town has streets named after places or persons connected with Christ Church, Oxford viz: Oseney, Busby, Gaisford, Caversham, Islip, Wolsey, Frideswide, Peckwater &amp; Hammond. All these streets lay behind the Oxford Arms. Some of the freehold of these streets is still in the name of Christ Church Oxford.

A network of streets in the north of Kentish Town was part of a large estate owned by St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Lady Margaret Road is named after Lady Margaret Beaufort, foundress of St John&#x27;s College. Burghley Road is named after Lord Burghley, Chancellor to Elizabeth I and benefactor of St John&#x27;s. Similarly, College Lane, Evangelist Road and Lady Somerset Road are street names linked to the estate of St John&#x27;s College.

In 1912 the Church of St Silas the Martyr (designed by architect Ernest Charles Shearman) was finally erected and consecrated, and by December of that year it became a parish in its own right. It can still be seen today along with the church of St Luke with St Paul and the Church of St Barnabas (handed over to the Greek Orthodox Church in 1957). The present Church of England parish church is St Benet and All Saints, Lupton Street.

In his poem &quot;Parliament Hill Fields,&quot; Sir John Betjeman refers to &quot;the curious Anglo-Norman parish church of Kentish Town&quot;. This possibly refers to the former parish Church of St John Kentish Town.

Kentish Town Road contains one of London&#x27;s many disused Tube stations. South Kentish Town tube station was closed in June 1924 after strike action at the Lots Road Power Station meant the lift could not be used. It never reopened as a station, although it was used as an air raid shelter during World War II. The distinctive building is now occupied underground by a massage shop and on ground level by a &#x27;Cash Converters&#x27; pawn shop at the corner of Kentish Town Road and Castle Road. There have been proposals to rebuild the station.

Kentish Town was to see further modernisation in the post-World War II period. However, the residential parts of Kentish Town, dating back to the mid-19th century have survived.

== Political representation ==
Kentish Town is part of the Holborn and St Pancras seat which is held by Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer as of March 2024. Kentish Town was an early base for the Social Democratic Party and the increasingly middle class population has returned large votes for the Greens and Liberal Democrats. In May 2006 the Liberal Democrats won two of the three Council seats in Kentish Town, strengthening this hold by taking the final seat in a by-election in November of the same year. In the Council elections in May 2010, Labour regained all three Council seats.

In May 2022, the ward of Kentish Town North elected two Labour Councillors Sylvia McNamara and James Slater. Kentish Town South reelected Labour Councillors Georgia Gould, Meric Apac, and Jenny Headlam-Wells.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census, 53% of the population was White British and 15% were White Other.

== Filming location ==

In 2002 the comedy and drama film &quot;About a Boy&quot; was filmed in Lady Margaret Road, which is located at the top of Kentish Town, and Oseney Crescent. Many of the filming locations used in the 2006 film &quot;Venus&quot;, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole, Leslie Phillips, and Jodie Whittaker were in Kentish Town. In 1959 Lady Somerset Road and Oakford Road were used substantially for the filming of &quot;Sapphire&quot;, a film exploring racial tension in London, directed by Basil Dearden. The Assembly House pub was the location for the 1971 film &quot;Villain&quot; starring Richard Burton. The 1993 comedy &quot;Bad Behaviour&quot;, featuring Stephen Rea and Sinéad Cusack, was set in Kentish Town and includes scenes set in several local streets and the Owl Bookshop.

The 1947 Ealing Studios film &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot; had scenes shot in Clarence Way during 1944 or 46 showing Holy Trinity Church with just the lower part of its spire still intact following the destruction of the upper section of the spire in WWII. The entire spire has since been removed leaving the church, effectively, with a tower. Kentish Town was also used as the location for the BBC comedy series &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot; with its main protagonists Tom and Linda living with their ex-prostitute landlord and upstairs neighbour Beryl at the fictional and suggestively named &quot;69 Paradise Passage&quot;. In addition, the video of the Madness track &quot;Baggy Trousers&quot; was filmed at Islip Street School and the park in Kentish Town.

The Anglican Parish Church of St John Kentish Town, now known as &quot;Christs Apostolic Church&quot;, was used by &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; as the backdrop (in external scenes) exterior of the Church where Damien was christened.

Plenty of exterior shots in the BBC tragicomedy Fleabag were filmed in Kentish Town, star/writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge being a resident.

== Shops and businesses ==
In 2005, a survey of Kentish Town by the local Green Party claimed that out of 87 shops on Kentish Town Road (locally known as Kentish Town High Street), 53 were still independently owned. The high street is a mixture of national retail chains and independent shops, including a long-standing bookshop, several delis and organic stores. Many &#x27;World Food&#x27; shops have opened up on the street. However, since 2009 there has been a marked increase in independent shops being replaced with chain stores including Pret a Manger, Costa Coffee, Caffe Nero and Sainsbury&#x27;s.

=== Kentish Town Health Centre ===
An architectural design competition was launched by RIBA Competitions and Camden Primary Care Trust and James Wigg Practice to design a new integrated care centre in Kentish Town that would deliver a flagship building, new models of care, enhance integrated working and provide a model for future delivery of primary care throughout the country. Through this process Architects AHMM were selected and the building opened in 2008 and has since been credited with a number of awards including RIBA Award for Architecture 2009 and &quot;Building Magazine&quot; Public Building Project of the Year 2010.

=== Kentish Town Community Centre ===
Kentish Town Community Centre is a community centre, created in 2004, to provide meeting spaces and activities for local residents of all ages.

== Culture ==

Pub rock is usually traced back to the &quot;Tally Ho&quot; in Kentish Town, a former jazz pub, where Eggs over Easy started playing in May 1971, and were soon joined by Bees Make Honey, Brinsley Schwarz, Max Merritt and the Meteors, Ducks Deluxe and others. The Assembly House is a Grade II listed pub at 292–294 Kentish Town Road.

Kentish Town is also home to The Forum (formerly known as the Town and Country club), during the 1950s a cinema, and now a live music venue. Spring 2014 saw Kentish Town to get its first speak easy, 1920s style hidden bar, when Knowhere Special opened its doors next to Kentish Town station.

Torriano Avenue, dating back to 1848, is a Kentish Town street home to Pete Stanley, one of the country&#x27;s best-known bluegrass banjo players; British actor Bill Nighy; and The Torriano Poets, where local poets have met for over 20 years and still hold weekly public poetry readings on Sunday evenings: its founder was John Rety. The street is also home to two pubs, one being an 1850s hostelry The Leighton, the other The Torriano, which was for many years an old-fashioned community off-licence. They take their names from the local landowners, Sir David Leighton and Joshua Torriano, who developed the land for housing in the mid 19th century.

One of London&#x27;s most famous nudist public baths, Rio&#x27;s, is in Kentish Town.

===Kentish Town Sports Centre===

The largest municipal building is the Kentish Town Sports Centre which opened as the St Pancras public baths in 1903, designed by Thomas W. Aldwinckle. The large complex originally had separate first and second class men&#x27;s baths and a women&#x27;s baths, along with a public hall. Little of the interior remains intact. The baths were closed in January 2007 for refurbishment and re-opened at the end of July 2010.

== Architecture and geography ==

Kentish Town has a fairly large boundary, stretching from Camden Gardens to as a far north as the Highgate Road/Gordon House Road junction near Dartmouth Park. Kentish Town generally includes the areas to the west, around Queens Crescent and to the east around Torriano.

<text>Kenton is a district in north-west London, England, to the east of Harrow and historically in Middlesex. As with surroundings in Harrow, Wembley and Kingsbury, the area was a product of Metroland suburbia of the early 20th century. Both the London and North Western Railway and Metropolitan Railway reached the area by the 1920s. The main road through Kenton, the east-west Kenton Road, is a busy and important road that links Harrow to the major Edgware Road. The road now forms the boundary between the London boroughs of Harrow and Brent.

== History ==
The hamlet was recorded as &quot;Keninton&quot; in 1232. The name derives from the personal name of the Saxon &quot;Coena&quot; and the Old English &quot;tun&quot;, a farm – and means &quot;the farm of Coena&quot; and his family who once lived on a site near here. Before the 20th century, the tiny settlement was concentrated around in what was Kenton Lane (the easternmost part of which remains as Old Kenton Lane to the east of Kingsbury station) and is now part of the present-day Woodgrange Avenue and Kenton Road.

The Windermere is a Grade II listed public house in Windermere Avenue. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors and was built in 1938. The Plough public house was Kenton&#x27;s first, opening in the early 18th century; the current building is not the original. It is now an Indo-Chinese fusion restaurant and bar.

Local Primary Schools include Uxendon Manor on Vista Way and Priestmead Primary School on Hartford Avenue. The local high school is Claremont High School on Claremont Avenue off Kenton Road.

Kenton station was opened by the London and North Western Railway on 15 June 1912. The Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s Northwick Park and Kenton station (later renamed Northwick Park) followed on 28 June 1923.

==Geography==

From its original location near The Grange, Kenton expanded toward Wealdstone, Wembley and Stanmore after the opening of Kenton station on the Euston to Watford Junction railway in 1912 and grew into a suburb of London from the 1920s.

The South Kenton area is distinct from Kenton, being almost contiguous with North Wembley and Preston. It is entirely within Brent.

Most of the district is part of the HA3 postcode, but the southern part is in HA9 and Northwick Park is in HA1.

===Waterways===
The Wealdstone Brook is the only visible waterway within the area. It has two branches, one originating in Wealdstone and the other in Stanmore; these combine underground near the junction of Kenton Lane and Kenton Road. The Western (Wealdstone) branch is in culvert as far as the south side of the Kenton Recreation Ground; the Eastern (Stanmore) branch is mostly in culvert from near the source on Clamp Hill to where it combines with the Western branch. It functions mainly as a land drain devoid of wildlife until it reaches Woodcock Park and was previously heavily polluted by run-off water and illicit connections from adjacent houses; a 2013 Thames Water project in the vicinity of Woodcock Park identified 140 premises discharging into the Brook.

==Housing==

The coming of the railways was soon followed by suburban development, most of Kenton being built between the Wars.

The London County Council built the Kenmore Park cottage estate between the wars. There are 654 houses on the site, a housing density of 11.3 per acre (28/ha).

Thomas Francis Nash owned building companies which from the 1920s onward built numerous private housing estates in Kenton, Ruislip and other parts of the &quot;Metroland&quot; area of Middlesex. F. &amp; C. Costin was another local building company that built much of Kenton between the wars. Local estate agents still use the term &quot;Nash-built&quot; or &quot;Costin-built&quot; to describe properties built by them in Kenton.

==Culture and media==
Apart from the infamous appearance of several of Kenton&#x27;s streets in the &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; episode of the BBC-TV comedy series &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; starring John Cleese, the only known reference to Kenton in modern popular culture is the song &quot;Kenton Kev&quot;, by the Berlin-based punk-jazz band The Magoo Brothers on their album &quot;Beyond Believable&quot;, released on the Bouncing Corporation label in 1988. The song refers to the &quot;pleasant valley&quot; high suburban boredom factor then prevalent in the area, and cites local characters and places, some fairly well known. It is said that &quot;Kenton Kev&quot; refers in fact to Kevin Jones, the US-based property magnate, who was actually born in Kenton. The song was written by Paul Bonin, Philip Ulysses Sanders and Melanie Hickford, all of whom grew up and lived in the area.

==Demography==
Kenton is represented by three electoral wards: Kenton East and Kenton West in Harrow, and Kenton in Brent. All together the population was 35,600 as of 2015.

Kenton has a high degree of its population belonging to ethnic minorities, over 70% in all three wards and higher than the Harrow and Brent averages; like much of Harrow and Wembley, there is a particularly large number of people from Indian descent.

The Kenton ward in Brent has a female life expectancy of 91.6 years, which is the third-highest in Greater London. The male expectancy was 83.3 years. The crime rate of Kenton East ward in Harrow was 33.5 in 2014/15, which was one of the lowest out of all wards in Greater London. Kenton East also has the lowest proportion of bicycle commuters in Greater London, amounting to only 0.2% of the population.

==Governance==
Kenton is part of both the Harrow East parliamentary constituency, most recently represented by Bob Blackman (Conservative), and the Brent North constituency which is represented by Barry Gardiner (Labour).

==Public services==

Kenton Library, run by Harrow Council, is located in Kenton Lane. Kenton Ambulance Station is located at the eastern end of Kenton, near Kingsbury Circle. Northwick Park Hospital is located very close by Kenton.

===Parks and sports===
There are three large open spaces in or near Kenton: Woodcock Park, Kenton Recreation Ground, and Northwick Park directly to the west in the northern part of Wembley.

The Kenton Sports Club and its ground is located on Kenton Lane which consists of cricket, tennis and table tennis.

===Education===
Secondary schools in the area are: St Gregory&#x27;s Catholic Science College, Claremont High School, and JFS.

===Religion===
Kenton has several religious institutions. Churches in the area include the Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, Kenton Baptist Church, Kenton Evangelical Church, and Kenton Methodist Church. Further east on Kenton Road are the All Saints Roman Catholic Church, and the St Panteleimon Greek Orthodox Church, the latter being one of the capital&#x27;s few Greek Orthodox churches outside North London. The building of St Panteleimon&#x27;s dates back to 1932. It was originally built as a mission church for St Mary&#x27;s, used by the Orthodox community from 1989, and acquired fully in 1994.

There are two Hindu mandirs: Haridham Swaminarayan Temple on Woodcock Hill, and Shree Kutch Satsang Swaminarayan Temple by Kenton Road. Kenton is also home to one of the UK&#x27;s Derasars on the east side of Kenton Road which serve followers of Jainism. By Woodcock Park is also a United Synagogue. There are no mosques in Kenton itself but the Harrow Central Mosque is quite proximate from some parts.

<text>Keston is a village in Greater London, England, located within the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London. Prior to 1965 it was within the historic county of Kent. It is part suburban, part rural in nature and lies on the edge of Hayes Common, just beyond the London conurbation to the south of Bromley Common. It includes the small hamlet of Nash to the southwest. The northern, more suburban part of Keston is sometimes referred to as Keston Mark.

==History==

Flint implements and pit dwellings on Keston and Hayes Commons show occupation of the area back to at least 3000 BCE, and there are Iron Age encampments in Holwood Park and on Keston Common.

In the valley below the village are the ruins of a complex of 3rd century AD Roman tombs and mausolea () connected with the nearby 1st - 4th century AD Roman villa excavated 1967-1992 ().

Sited closer to the original Keston Court than the main village itself, Keston&#x27;s small medieval church is unusual in that does not have a dedication to a saint; but built into the altar-table is the top of the 17th-century altar inlaid with a very elaborate cross and inscribed &quot;The Keston Marke: IN HOC SIGNO VINCES&quot;, so the parish has a distinctive symbol instead.

The slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce was a frequent visitor to the area as his close friend, the Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, lived at Holwood Park. It was on top of the vale of Keston near to an oak tree that he discussed the abolition of slavery with his friend, Pitt. Only the partial dead remains of the &#x27;Wilberforce oak&#x27; are left, but a new oak tree has been planted in its place. A stone bench, &#x27;Wilberforce seat&#x27;, commemorating the event, now marks the spot and bears the inscription from his diary &quot;Just above a steep descent into the vale of Keston, I resolved to give notice ... in the House of Commons of my intention to bring forward the abolition of the Slave Trade.&quot;

Holwood was described in Pitt&#x27;s time as &quot; a small, neat, white building; it is more simple than elegant&quot;. Pitt engaged John Soane to enlarge the house and Humphry Repton to improve the grounds. Soane&#x27;s house burnt down, and was rebuilt in 1823-6 for John Ward in a Grecian style by Decimus Burton. The new house was on a larger scale than Pitt&#x27;s, in white brick and Portland stone. Later owners included Lord Chancellor Cranworth, the Earl of Derby, and Seismograph Service Ltd.
The Keston Institute, now at Oxford, was so named because for some years from the early 1970s it was located (as Keston College) in the former parish school on Keston Common. Its archive is at the Keston Centre for Religion Politics and Society at Baylor University, Texas, so the parish&#x27;s name has spread surprisingly far.

There was historically a small hamlet situated to the north-east of Keston village, at the junction of Croydon Road and Westerham Road/Oakley Road; it was called Keston Mark as it lay on the border (&#x27;march&#x27; or &#x27;mark&#x27;) of Keston proper. This area was more heavily developed in the 20th century, and it now effectively forms a suburban continuation of Locksbottom and Bromley Common.

==Keston Park==
Keston Park is a gated community covering an area of approximately with approximately 200 residential properties. It is bounded by Westerham Road to the west, Croydon Road to the north and Farnborough Common to the north east. The land on which the Park stands was part of the Holwood Estate owned by the Earl of Derby.

Its most famous past resident is former prime minister Margaret Thatcher who with her late husband Denis raised their children, Mark and Carol. Others residents include Rolling Stone, Bill Wyman, Arsenal and England footballer, Kenny Sansom, founder of Direct Line, Peter Wood and some of the YouTube stars KSI, Miniminter, Vikkstar123 and Zerkaa, who are part of the YouTube supergroup SIDEMEN ., Nobel Prize winner for medicine Sir John Vane, chef Gary Rhodes, founder of Pimlico Plumbers Charlie Mullins, Tennis Player and TV Presenter Annabelle Croft.

===History===
When Frederick Rogers bought of land from the Earl of Derby on 9 January 1923 for £6000, it was for the purpose of developing Keston Park.

The land was formerly known as the Keston Lodge Estate. Keston Lodge was the dower house to Holwood House and was occupied by Lady Ashton. It was probably regarded at the time as a separate part of the Holwood Estate and was divided from it by the public footpath which runs from Farnborough Common, almost opposite Hilda Vale Road, to Westerham Road, near to Fishponds Road.

Keston Lodge (not to be confused with a property of the same name, which stood on the opposite side of Croydon Road and is now occupied by houses in the vicinity of Cedar Crescent) later became the Keston Park Hotel. It was taken down in the 1960s. The site is now developed as Keston Park Close. The stables of the old Keston Lodge remained until the late 1970s when they too were demolished to make way for three new houses in Forest Ridge. Keston Lodge was approached through the present entrance to Forest Ridge/Forest Drive on Croydon Road. The drive ran up the line of Forest Ridge, curving back around the stables to the left to come out in front of the south side of the house. An unfenced road is shown on early maps on the line of the present Forest Drive, and this was probably the main link between Keston Lodge and Holwood House.

Holwood Park Avenue lies on the line of the north carriageway from Holwood House. According to some early maps the north carriageway was used as the principal entrance to Holwood House. There was a further access onto Croydon Road and another lodge house at Poynters Lodge near Gap House. Access is now gained to Holwood House along the west carriageway which comes out into Westerham Road at Bowens Lodge.

As well as Holwood House (built in the 1750s, Grade II listed and now called Holwood Mansion) and the old lodges, there are still some physical remains of the Keston Lodge Estate. There are also three fishponds on Keston Common, adjacent to Fishponds Road. The ponds were constructed in the early 19th century to provide a water supply to Holwood House, and are now part of popular recreational area and part of Keston Common.

Jesmond Cottage, now renamed Bushwood at 30 Forest Drive, is older than the rest of the houses on the Park. Close behind it are the walls of the old kitchen garden and greenhouses which used to serve the estate. The garden and greenhouses covered a substantial area and incorporated two ponds in the run of the stream between Forest Drive and Forest Ridge.

Further west is the old pavilion, which dates from the time when the lower part of Longdon Wood was a cricket ground.

==River Ravensbourne==
The River Ravensbourne rises at &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Well&quot; via Keston Ponds. The Ravensbourne is in length and flows through the London Boroughs of Bromley, Lewisham and Greenwich. Since 1991, Quaggy Waterways Action Group (QWAG) have spent millions maintaining the River Ravensbourne. The &quot;London LOOP&quot; walk passes the ponds on its way from Farnborough to West Wickham. Every year on 1 May at 05:32, the Ravensbourne Morris Men dance up the Beltane Sunrise at Caesar&#x27;s Well, the source of the Ravensbourne River.

==Public Houses==
Following the conversion of the &quot;Keston Mark&quot; to residential accommodation, Keston has three pubs. &quot;The Two Doves&quot; in Oakley Road lies between the village and Bromley Common, with the remaining two being in the village itself and within sight of each other; &quot;The Fox Inn&quot; on Heathfield Road and the &quot;Greyhound&quot; on Commonside. The latter is well-known locally as the venue for the Boxing Day performance of the local Morris Dancing side, the Ravensbourne Morris Men who have performed there, collecting for charity, since a visit in 1963 to Keston by Richard Chamberlain.

==Windmills==
Keston has had three windmills over the centuries: the post mill built in 1716 that still stands on Keston Common, a smock mill known as Olive&#x27;s Mill, built in 1824 and burnt down between 1878 and 1885, and a third mill, which stood at Holwood Park.

===St. Audrey&#x27;s===
A small private church dedicated to St. Audrey was built by Lord Sackville Cecil, son of the Marquess of Salisbury, on the site of Olive&#x27;s Mill in 1889. The church and other mill premises came into the possession of the parish in 1908, and since 1925 the former Olive&#x27;s Mill House has been used as the rectory. (The former rectory, next to the parish church, was sold off as it was deemed too large, and was later bombed in the Second World War). The mill buildings were for nearly a century used as parish rooms. The church has now been secularised.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The nearest railway station to Keston is Hayes, the terminus of the Hayes line, some to the northwest.

<text>Rifling is the term for helical grooves machined into the internal surface of a firearms&#x27;s barrel for imparting a spin to a projectile to improve its aerodynamic stability and accuracy. It is also the term (as a verb) for creating such grooves.

Rifling is measured in &quot;twist rate&quot;, the distance the rifling takes to complete one full revolution, expressed as a ratio with 1 as its base (e.g., 1:). A shorter distance/lower ratio indicates a faster twist, generating a higher spin rate (and greater projectile stability). 

The combination of length, weight, and shape of a projectile determines the twist rate needed to gyroscopically stabilize it: barrels intended for short, large-diameter projectiles such as spherical lead balls require a very low twist rate, such as 1 turn in 48 inches (122 cm). Barrels intended for long, small-diameter projectiles, such as the ultra-low-drag 80-grain 0.223 inch bullets (5.2 g, 5.56 mm), use twist rates of 1 turn in 8 inches (20 cm) or faster.

Rifling which increases the twist rate from breech to muzzle is called a &quot;gain&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot;
twist; a rate which decreases down the length of a barrel 
is undesirable because it cannot reliably stabilize the projectile as it travels down the bore.

An extremely long projectile, such as a flechette, requires impractically high twist rates to stabilize; it is often stabilized aerodynamically instead. An aerodynamically stabilized projectile can be fired from a smoothbore barrel without a reduction in accuracy.

== History ==

Muskets are smoothbore, large caliber weapons using ball-shaped ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to the high cost, great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily and speedily from the muzzle, musket balls were generally a loose fit in the barrels. Consequently, on firing the balls would often bounce off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final destination after leaving the muzzle was less predictable. This was countered when accuracy was more important, for example when hunting, by using a tighter-fitting combination of a closer-to-bore-sized ball and a patch. The accuracy was improved, but still not reliable for precision shooting over long distances.

Like the invention of gunpowder itself, the inventor of barrel rifling is not yet definitely known. Straight grooving had been applied to small arms since at least 1480, originally intended as &quot;soot grooves&quot; to collect gunpowder residue.

Some of the earliest recorded European attempts of spiral-grooved musket barrels were of Gaspard Kollner, a gunsmith of Vienna in 1498 and Augustus Kotter of Nuremberg in 1520. Some scholars allege that Kollner&#x27;s works at the end of the 15th century only used straight grooves, and it was not until he received help from Kotter that a working spiral-grooved firearm was made. There may have been attempts even earlier than this, as the main inspiration of rifled firearms came from archers and crossbowmen who realized that their projectiles flew far faster and more accurately when they imparted rotation through twisted fletchings.

Though true rifling dates from the 16th century, it had to be engraved by hand and consequently did not become commonplace until the mid-19th century. Due to the laborious and expensive manufacturing process involved, early rifled firearms were primarily used by wealthy recreational hunters, who did not need to fire their weapons many times in rapid succession and appreciated the increased accuracy. Rifled firearms were not popular with military users since they were difficult to clean, and loading projectiles presented numerous challenges. If the bullet was of sufficient diameter to take up the rifling, a large mallet was required to force it down the bore. If, on the other hand, it was of reduced diameter to assist in its insertion, the bullet would not fully engage the rifling and accuracy was reduced.

The first practical military weapons using rifling with black powder were breech loaders such as the Queen Anne pistol.

== Twist rate ==


For best performance, the barrel should have a twist rate sufficient to spin stabilize any bullet that it would reasonably be expected to fire, but not significantly more. Large diameter bullets provide more stability, as the larger radius provides more gyroscopic inertia, while long bullets are harder to stabilize, as they tend to be very backheavy and the aerodynamic pressures have a longer arm (&quot;lever&quot;) to act on. The slowest twist rates are found in muzzle-loading firearms meant to fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in , or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose muzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in is very common. The M16A2 rifle, which is designed to fire the 5.56×45mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer bullets, has a 1 in or 32 calibers twist. Civilian AR-15 rifles are commonly found with 1 in or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in or 41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle. Rifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general have higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter bullets.

There are three methods in use to describe the twist rate:

The, traditionally speaking, most common method expresses the twist rate in terms of the &#x27;travel&#x27; (length) required to complete one full projectile revolution in the rifled barrel. This method does not give an easy or straightforward understanding of whether a twist rate is &quot;relatively&quot; slow or fast when bores of different diameters are compared.

The second method describes the &#x27;rifled travel&#x27; required to complete one full projectile revolution in calibers or bore diameters:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the twist rate expressed in bore diameters; formula_3 is the twist length required to complete one full projectile revolution (in mm or in); and formula_4 is the bore diameter (diameter of the lands, in mm or in).

The twist travel formula_3 and the bore diameter formula_4 must be expressed in a consistent unit of measure, i.e. metric (mm) &quot;or&quot; imperial (in).

The third method simply reports the angle of the grooves relative to the bore axis, measured in degrees.

The latter two methods have the inherent advantage of expressing twist rate as a ratio and give an easy understanding if a twist rate is &quot;relatively&quot; slow or fast even when comparing bores of differing diameters.

In 1879, George Greenhill, a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich, London, UK developed a rule of thumb for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets. This shortcut uses the bullet&#x27;s length, needing no allowances for weight or nose shape. The eponymous &quot;Greenhill Formula&quot;, still used today, is:

formula_7

where formula_8 is 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s); formula_9 is the bullet&#x27;s diameter in inches; formula_3 is the bullet&#x27;s length in inches; and formula_11 is the bullet&#x27;s specific gravity (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation).

The original value of formula_8 was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn, when given the diameter formula_9 and the length formula_3 of the bullet in inches. This works to velocities of about 840 m/s (2800 ft/s); above those velocities, a formula_8 of 180 should be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600 m/s (2000 ft/s), a diameter of and a length of , the Greenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in .

Improved formulas for determining stability and twist rates include the Miller Twist Rule and the McGyro program developed by Bill Davis and Robert McCoy.

If an insufficient twist rate is used, the bullet will begin to yaw and then tumble; this is usually seen as &quot;keyholing&quot;, where bullets leave elongated holes in the target as they strike at an angle. Once the bullet starts to yaw, any hope of accuracy is lost, as the bullet will begin to veer off in random directions as it precesses.

Conversely, too high a rate of twist can also cause problems. The excessive twist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and coupled with high velocities also induce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile jacket ruptures causing high velocity spin stabilized projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono metals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they disintegrate in flight due to their spin rate. Smokeless powder can produce muzzle velocities of approximately for spin stabilized projectiles and more advanced propellants used in smoothbore tank guns can produce muzzle velocities of approximately . A higher twist than needed can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency within the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass, may be magnified by the spin. Undersized bullets also have problems, as they may not enter the rifling exactly concentric and coaxial to the bore, and excess twist will exacerbate the accuracy problems this causes.

A bullet fired from a rifled barrel can spin at over 300,000 rpm (5 kHz), depending on the bullet&#x27;s muzzle velocity and the barrel&#x27;s twist rate.

The general definition of the spin formula_16 of an object rotating around a single axis can be written as:

formula_17

where formula_18 is the linear velocity of a point in the rotating object (in units of distance/time) and formula_8 refers to the circumference of the circle that this measuring point performs around the axis of rotation.

A bullet that matches the rifling of the firing barrel will exit that barrel with a spin:

formula_20
where formula_21 is the muzzle velocity and formula_3 is the twist rate.

For example, an M4 Carbine with a twist rate of 1 in and a muzzle velocity of will give the bullet a spin of 930 m/s / 0.1778 m = 5.2 kHz (314,000 rpm).

Excessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet&#x27;s designed limits and the resulting centrifugal force can cause the bullet to disintegrate radially during flight.

== Design ==
A barrel of circular bore cross-section is not capable of imparting a spin to a projectile, so a rifled barrel has a non-circular cross-section. Typically the rifled barrel contains one or more grooves that run down its length, giving it a cross-section resembling an internal gear, though it can also take the shape of a polygon, usually with rounded corners. Since the barrel is not circular in cross-section, it cannot be accurately described with a single diameter. Rifled bores may be described by the &quot;bore diameter&quot; (the diameter across the &quot;lands&quot; or high points in the rifling), or by &quot;groove diameter&quot; (the diameter across the &quot;grooves&quot; or low points in the rifling). Differences in naming conventions for cartridges can cause confusion; for example, the projectiles of the .303 British are actually slightly larger in diameter than the projectiles of the .308 Winchester, because the &quot;.303&quot; refers to the bore diameter in inches (bullet is .312), while the &quot;.308&quot; refers to the bullet diameter in inches (7.92 mm and 7.82 mm, respectively).

Despite differences in form, the common goal of rifling is to deliver the projectile accurately to the target. In addition to imparting the spin to the bullet, the barrel must hold the projectile securely and concentrically as it travels down the barrel. This requires that the rifling meet a number of tasks:
*It must be sized so that the projectile will swage or obturate upon firing to fill the bore.
*The diameter should be consistent, and must not increase towards the muzzle.
*The rifling should be consistent down the length of the bore, without changes in cross-section, such as variations in groove width or spacing.
*It should be smooth, with no scratches lying perpendicular to the bore, so it does not abrade material from the projectile.
*The chamber and crown must smoothly transition the projectile into and out of the rifling.

Rifling may not begin immediately forward of the chamber. There may be an unrifled throat ahead of the chamber so a cartridge may be chambered without pushing the bullet into the rifling. This reduces the force required to load a cartridge into the chamber, and prevents leaving a bullet stuck in the rifling when an unfired cartridge is removed from the chamber. The specified diameter of the throat may be somewhat greater than groove diameter, and may be enlarged by use if hot powder gas melts the interior barrel surface when the rifle is fired. Freebore is a groove-diameter length of smoothbore barrel without lands forward of the throat. Freebore allows the bullet to transition from static friction to sliding friction and gain linear momentum prior to encountering the resistance of increasing rotational momentum. Freebore may allow more effective use of propellants by reducing the initial pressure peak during the minimum volume phase of internal ballistics before the bullet starts moving down the barrel. Barrels with freebore length exceeding the rifled length have been known by a variety of trade names including paradox.

== Manufacture ==

An early method of introducing rifling to a pre-drilled barrel was to use a cutter mounted on a square-section rod, accurately twisted into a spiral of the desired pitch, mounted in two fixed square-section holes. As the cutter was advanced through the barrel it twisted at a uniform rate governed by the pitch. The first cut was shallow. The cutter points were gradually expanded as repeated cuts were made. The blades were in slots in a wooden dowel which were gradually packed out with slips of paper until the required depth was obtained. The process was finished off by casting a slug of molten lead into the barrel, withdrawing it and using it with a paste of emery and oil to smooth the bore.

Most rifling is created by either:

* Cutting one groove at a time with a tool (&quot;cut rifling&quot; or &quot;single point cut rifling&quot;);
* Cutting all grooves in one pass with a special progressive broaching bit (&quot;broached rifling&quot;);
* Pressing all grooves at once with a tool called a &quot;button&quot; that is pushed or pulled down the barrel (&quot;button rifling&quot;);
* Forging the barrel over a mandrel containing a reverse image of the rifling, and often the chamber as well (&quot;hammer forging&quot;);
* Flow forming the barrel preform over a mandrel containing a reverse image of the rifling (&quot;rifling by flow forming&quot;)
* Using non-contact forces such as chemical reaction or heat from laser source to etch the rifling pattern (&quot;etching rifling&quot;)
* Machining the rifling grooves texture on a thin metal plate, then folding the plate into the inner bore of the barrel (&quot;liner rifling&quot;)

The &quot;grooves&quot; are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called &quot;lands&quot;. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape, direction of twist (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by rifling significantly improves the stability of the projectile, improving both range and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel, usually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn. Occasionally firearms are encountered with a &quot;gain twist&quot;, where the rate of spin increases from chamber to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare, due to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common. Since a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy, gunsmiths who are machining a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist carefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference is, at the muzzle end.

== Projectiles ==

The original firearms were loaded from the muzzle by forcing a ball from the muzzle to the chamber. Whether using a rifled or smooth bore, a good fit was needed to seal the bore and provide the best possible accuracy from the gun. To ease the force required to load the projectile, these early guns used an undersized ball, and a patch made of cloth, paper, or leather to fill the &quot;windage&quot; (the gap between the ball and the walls of the bore). The patch acted as a wadding and provided some degree of pressure sealing, kept the ball seated on the charge of black powder, and kept the ball concentric to the bore. In rifled barrels, the patch also provided a means to transfer the spin from the rifling to the bullet, as the patch is engaged rather than the ball. Until the advent of the hollow-based Minié ball, which expands and obturates upon firing to seal the bore and engage the rifling, the patch provided the best means of getting the projectile to engage the rifling.

In breech-loading firearms, the task of seating the projectile into the rifling is handled by the &quot;throat&quot; of the chamber. Next is the &quot;freebore&quot;, which is the portion of the throat down which the projectile travels before the rifling starts. The last section of the throat is the &quot;throat angle&quot;, where the throat transitions into the rifled barrel.

The throat is usually sized slightly larger than the projectile, so the loaded cartridge can be inserted and removed easily, but the throat should be as close as practical to the groove diameter of the barrel. Upon firing, the projectile expands under the pressure from the chamber, and obturates to fit the throat. The bullet then travels down the throat and engages the rifling, where it is engraved, and begins to spin. Engraving the projectile requires a significant amount of force, and in some firearms there is a significant amount of freebore, which helps keep chamber pressures low by allowing the propellant gases to expand before being required to engrave the projectile. Minimizing freebore improves accuracy by decreasing the chance that a projectile will distort before entering the rifling.

When the projectile is swaged into the rifling, it takes on a mirror image of the rifling, as the lands push into the projectile in a process called &quot;engraving&quot;. Engraving takes on not only the major features of the bore, such as the lands and grooves, but also minor features, like scratches and tool marks. The relationship between the bore characteristics and the engraving on the projectile are often used in forensic ballistics.

== Recent developments ==

The grooves most commonly used in modern rifling have fairly sharp edges. More recently, polygonal rifling, a throwback to the earliest types of rifling, has become popular, especially in handguns. Polygonal barrels tend to have longer service lives because the reduction of the sharp edges of the land (the grooves are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called lands) reduces erosion of the barrel. Supporters of polygonal rifling also claim higher velocities and greater accuracy. Polygonal rifling is currently seen on pistols from CZ, Heckler &amp; Koch, Glock, Tanfoglio, and the Kahr Arms (P series only), as well as the Desert Eagle.

For field artillery pieces, the &quot;extended range, full bore&quot; (ERFB) concept developed in early 1970s by Dennis Hyatt Jenkins and Luis Palacio of Gerald Bull&#x27;s Space Research Corporation for the GC-45 howitzer replaces the bourrelet with small nubs, which both tightly fit into lands of the barrel. Guns capable of firing these projectiles have achieved significant increases in range, but this is compensated with a significantly (3–4 times) decreased accuracy, due to which they were not adopted by NATO militaries. Unlike a shell narrower than the gun&#x27;s bore with a sabot, ERFB shells use the full bore, permitting a larger payload. Examples include the South African G5 and the German PzH 2000. ERFB may be combined with base bleed.

== Variable pitch rifling ==
A &quot;gain-twist&quot; or &quot;progressive rifling&quot; begins with a slow twist rate that gradually increases down the bore, resulting in very little initial change in the projectile&#x27;s angular momentum during the first few inches of bullet travel after it enters the throat. This enables the bullet to remain essentially undisturbed and trued to the case mouth. After engaging the rifling at the throat, the bullet is progressively subjected to accelerated angular momentum as it is propelled down the barrel. The theoretical advantage is that by gradually increasing the spin rate, torque is imparted along a much longer bore length, allowing thermomechanical stress to be spread over a larger area rather than being focused predominantly at the throat, which typically wears out much faster than other parts of the barrel. Gain-twist rifling was used prior to and during the American Civil War (1861–65). Colt Army and Navy revolvers both employed gain-twist rifling. Gain-twist rifling, however, is more difficult to produce than uniform rifling, and therefore is more expensive. The military has used gain-twist rifling in a variety of weapons such as the M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used in some current fighter jets and the larger GAU-8 Avenger Gatling gun used in the A10 Thunderbolt II close air support jet. In these applications it allows lighter construction of the barrels by decreasing chamber pressures through the use of low initial twist rates but ensuring the projectiles have sufficient stability once they leave the barrel. It is seldom used in commercially available products, though notably on the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 460 (X-treme Velocity Revolver).

<text>Kew () is a district in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Its population at the 2011 census was 11,436. Kew is the location of the Royal Botanic Gardens (&quot;Kew Gardens&quot;), now a World Heritage Site, which includes Kew Palace. Kew is also the home of important historical documents such as Domesday Book, which is held at The National Archives.

Julius Caesar may have forded the Thames at Kew in 54 BC during the Gallic Wars. Successive Tudor, Stuart and Georgian monarchs maintained links with Kew. During the French Revolution, many refugees established themselves there and it was the home of several artists in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Since 1965 Kew has incorporated the former area of North Sheen which includes St Philip and All Saints, the first barn church consecrated in England. It is now in a combined Church of England parish with St Luke&#x27;s Church, Kew.

Today, Kew is an expensive residential area because of its prosperous suburban attributes. Among these are sports-and-leisure open spaces, schools, transport links, architecture, restaurants, no high-rise buildings, modest road sizes, trees and gardens. Most of Kew developed in the late 19th century, following the arrival of the District line of the London Underground. Further development took place in the 1920s and 1930s when new houses were built on the market gardens of North Sheen and in the first decade of the 21st century when considerably more river-fronting flats and houses were constructed by the Thames on land formerly owned by Thames Water.

==Etymology==

The name Kew, recorded in 1327 as &quot;Cayho&quot;, is a combination of two words: the Old French &quot;kai&quot; (landing place; &quot;quay&quot; derives from this) and Old English &quot;hoh&quot; (spur of land). The land spur is formed by the bend in the Thames.

==Governance==

Kew is one of 18 wards in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It forms part of the Richmond Park constituency in the UK Parliament; the Member of Parliament is Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats. For elections to the London Assembly it is part of the South West London Assembly constituency, which is represented by Gareth Roberts of the Liberal Democrats.

Kew was added in 1892 to the Municipal Borough of Richmond which had been formed two years earlier and was in the county of Surrey. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the Municipal Borough of Richmond was abolished. Kew, along with Richmond, was transferred from Surrey to the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, one of 32 boroughs in the newly created Greater London.

==Economy==
The fashion clothing retailer Jigsaw&#x27;s headquarters, now at Water Lane, Richmond, were previously in Mortlake Road, Kew.

A former industry in Kew was that of nameplate manufacturing, by the Caxton Name Plate Manufacturing Company, based on Kew Green. The company was founded in 1964 and folded in 1997.

It was in Kew that viscose was first developed into rayon, in a laboratory near Kew Gardens station run by Cowey Engineering. Rayon was produced in a factory on South Avenue, off Sandycombe Road, before Courtaulds acquired the patents for rayon in 1904.

Also on a site near Kew Gardens station, the engineering company F C Blake, now commemorated in the Kew street name Blake Mews, produced petrol-powered traction engines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Chrysler and Dodge===

Kew Retail Park stands on the site of a former aircraft factory established in 1918 by Harry Whitworth, who owned Glendower Aircraft Ltd. The factory built Airco DH.4s and Sopwith Salamanders for the British government in the First World War.

In 1923 the now-redundant aircraft factory was sold and it became a factory for road vehicles. From the 1920s until 1967, Dodge made lorries at this factory, with the model name Kew. Cars were also manufactured there. Dodge Brothers became a Chrysler subsidiary in 1928 and lorry production moved to Chrysler&#x27;s car plant at Kew. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis, at its works in Kew, using American engines and gearboxes. After Chrysler bought the Maxwell Motor Company and their Kew works, the cars of the lighter Chrysler range – Chryslers, De Sotos and Plymouths – were assembled at this Kew site until the Second World War. The various models of De Sotos were named &quot;Richmond, Mortlake&quot; and &quot;Croydon&quot;; Plymouths were &quot;Kew Six&quot; and &quot;Wimbledon&quot;.

During the Second World War this Chrysler factory was part of the London Aircraft Production Group and built Handley Page Halifax aircraft assemblies. When wartime aircraft production ceased, the plant did not resume assembly of North American cars.

==People==
===Royal associations with Kew===



====The Tudors and Stuarts====
Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester (c.1460–1526) was granted lands at Kew in 1517. When he died in 1526 he left his Kew estates to his third wife, Eleanor, with the remainder to his son George. In 1538 Sir George Somerset sold the house for £200 to Thomas Cromwell (c.1485–1540), who resold it for the same amount to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (c. 1484–1545). Brandon had probably already inhabited Kew during the life of his wife Mary Tudor, daughter of Henry VII and widow of the French king Louis XII. According to John Leland&#x27;s &quot;Cygnea Cantio&quot; (&quot;Swan Song&quot;), she stayed in Kew (which he refers to as &quot;Cheva&quot;) for a time after her return to England.

One of Henry VIII&#x27;s closest friends, Henry Norris (c.1482–1536), lived at Kew Farm, which was later owned by Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (1532–1588). This large palatial house on the Thames riverbank predated the royal palaces of Kew Palace and the White House. Excavations at Kew Gardens in 2009 revealed a wall that may have belonged to the property.

In Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and under the Stuarts, houses were developed along Kew Green. West Hall, which survives in West Hall Road, dates from at least the 14th century and the present house was built at the end of the 17th century.

Elizabeth Stuart (1596–1662), daughter of James I, later known as the &quot;Winter Queen&quot;, was given a household at Kew in 1608.

Queen Anne subscribed to the building of the parish church on Kew Green, which was dedicated to St Anne in 1714, three months before the queen&#x27;s death.

====The Hanoverians====
The Hanoverians maintained the strongest links with Kew, in particular Princess Augusta who founded the botanic gardens and her husband Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707–1751) who lived at the White House in Kew. Augusta, as Dowager Princess of Wales, continued to live there until her death in 1772. Frederick commissioned the building of the first substantial greenhouse at Kew Gardens.

In 1772 King George III and Queen Charlotte moved into the White House at Kew. Charlotte died at the Dutch House (now Kew Palace) in 1818.

King William IV spent most of his early life at Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors.

===Georgian expansion===
During the French Revolution, many refugees established themselves in Kew, having built many of the houses of this period. In the 1760s and 1770s the presence of royalty attracted artists such as Thomas Gainsborough and Johann Zoffany.

===Artists associated with Kew===
*Diana Armfield (born 1920) lives in Kew. She is known for landscapes, and has also painted portraits, literary subjects and still lifes. She has a particular interest in flower paintings, and is considered to owe much to the tradition of Walter Sickert.
*Margaret Backhouse (1818–1896) was a successful British portrait and genre painter during the 19th century who lived at Lichfield Villas.
*Franz (later Francis) Bauer (1758–1840) was an Austrian microscopist and botanical artist who became the first botanical illustrator at Kew Gardens. By 1790 he had settled at Kew, where as well as making detailed paintings and drawings of flower dissections, often at microscopic level, he tutored Queen Charlotte, her daughter Princess Elizabeth and William Hooker in the art of illustration, and often entertained friends and botanists at his home. He is buried at St Anne&#x27;s, next to Thomas Gainsborough.
* The American-born English artist Walter Deverell (1827–1854), who was associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, lived at 352 Kew Road, then called Heathfield House. He had a studio at the end of the garden where there are now garages. In this setting he painted &quot;The Pet&quot;.
* Bernard Dunstan (1920–2017) lived in Kew. He was an artist, teacher and author, best known for his studies of figures in interiors and landscapes. At the time of his death, he was the longest serving Royal Academician.
*George Engleheart (1750–1829), one of the greatest English painters of portrait miniatures, was born in Kew.
* Walter Hood Fitch (1817–1892), botanical illustrator, lived on Kew Green.
*Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788), who is considered one of the most important British artists of the second half of the 18th century, visited Kew many times, staying with his friend Joshua Kirby and, after Kirby&#x27;s death, in a house probably rented by his daughter close to St Anne&#x27;s Church, where he is buried.
*Arthur Hughes (1832–1915), Pre-Raphaelite painter, lived and died at Eastside House, 22 Kew Green. The site is marked by a blue plaque.
*Tom Keating (1917–1984), artist, art restorer and art forger, lived in Kew from 1961 to 1967. He was best known for his highly-publicised crusade against the art world, his trial for art fraud at the Old Bailey, and his critically acclaimed Channel 4 television series &quot;Tom Keating On Painters.&quot;
*Joshua Kirby (1716–1774) was a landscape painter, engraver, and writer, whose main artistic focus was &quot;linear perspective&quot;, based on the ideas of English mathematician Brook Taylor. He was the son of topographer John Kirby, and the father of the writer Sarah Trimmer and the entomologist William Kirby. In 1760 he moved to Kew, where he taught linear perspective to George III. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society.
*Sir Peter Lely (1618–1680), portrait painter, had a house on the north side of Kew Green. On almost exactly the same site, Jeremiah Meyer (1735–1789), miniaturist to Queen Charlotte and George III, built a house a century later. Meyer is buried at St Anne&#x27;s.
*Charles Mozley (1914–1991), artist and art teacher, lived and died at 358 Kew Road, Kew.
*Victorian artist Marianne North (1830–1890) did not live in Kew, but she left to Kew Gardens her collection of botanic art, painted on her extensive overseas travels, and funded a gallery – the Marianne North Gallery – to house them.
* French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro (1830–1903) stayed in 1892 at 10 Kew Green, on the corner of Gloucester Road, now marked by a blue plaque. During his stay he painted &quot;Kew Gardens – Path to the Great Glasshouse&quot; (1892), &quot;Kew Greens&quot; (1892) and &quot;Church at Kew&quot; (1892). His third son, Félix Pissarro (1874–1897), painter, etcher and caricaturist, died in a sanatorium at 262 Kew Road in 1897.
*Charles Shannon (1863–1937), artist best known for his portraits, died in Kew at 21 Kew Gardens Road.
*Matilda Smith (1854–1926), the first official botanical artist of the Royal Botanic Gardens, lived at Gloucester Road, Kew.
*The painter Johan Zoffany (1725–1810), who lived at Strand-on-the-Green, is buried in St Anne&#x27;s churchyard.

===Botanists who have lived in Kew===
Unsurprisingly, many botanists have lived in Kew, near the botanic gardens:

*William Aiton (1731–1793), botanist, was appointed director in 1759 of the newly established botanical garden at Kew, where he remained until his death. He effected many improvements at the gardens, and in 1789 he published &quot;Hortus Kewensis&quot;, a catalogue of the plants cultivated there. When he died, he was succeeded as director at Kew Gardens by his son William Townsend Aiton (1766–1849), who was also a botanist, and was born in Kew. William Townsend Aiton was one of the founders of the Royal Horticultural Society. He retired in 1841 but remained living at Kew, although passing much of his time with his brother at Kensington where he died in 1849. Both father and son lived at Descanso House on Kew Green and are buried in St Anne&#x27;s churchyard where the substantial family tomb is a prominent feature. Inside the church there is also a memorial to them.
* Sir William Hooker (1785–1865) and his son Sir Joseph Hooker (1817–1911), botanists and directors of Kew Gardens, lived at 49 Kew Green, Kew. The site is marked by a blue plaque.
*John Hutchinson (1884–1972), botanist, lived on Kew Green, near Kew Gardens&#x27; Herbarium, during the Second World War.
* Daniel Oliver (1830–1916), Professor of Botany at University College London 1861–88 and Keeper of Kew Gardens&#x27; Herbarium 1864–90, lived on Kew Green.
* Henry Nicholas Ridley (1855–1956), botanist, geologist and naturalist, died at his home in Kew.
*John Smith (1798–1888), botanist, the first curator at Kew Gardens, lived on Kew Green. He died at Park House, Kew Road, and is buried in St Anne&#x27;s churchyard.
* William T Stearn (1911–2001), botanist, who was president of the Linnean Society, lived in Kew.
*John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (1713–1792), botanist and honorary director of Kew Gardens 1754–72, adviser to Princess Augusta and tutor to George III and, later, Prime Minister of Great Britain 1762–63, lived at King&#x27;s Cottage, 33 Kew Green.

==Demography==
In the ten years from the time of the 2001 census, the population rose from 9,445 to 11,436, the sharpest ten-year increase in Kew since the early 20th century. This was partly accounted for by the conversion of former Thames Water land to residential use, and increases in property sizes. The figures are based on those for Kew ward, the boundaries of the enlarged parish having been adjusted to allow for all wards in the borough to be equally sized.

===Homes and households===


===Ethnicity===
In the 2011 census, 66.2% of Kew&#x27;s population were White British. Other White was the second largest category at 16%, with 8.1% being Asian.

==Transport==
In the past, a main mode of transport between Kew and London, for rich and poor alike, was by water along the Thames, which separated Middlesex (on the north bank) from Surrey: Kew was also connected to Brentford, Middlesex by ferry, first replaced by a bridge in 1759. The current Kew Bridge, which carries the South Circular Road (the A205), was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1903.

Kew Road (A307) passes through Kew as a single carriageway, and provides the main road link to Richmond. The M4 motorway starts a short distance north of Kew, providing access to Heathrow Airport and the west. The A316 road starts in Chiswick and continues over Chiswick Bridge and a complex junction with the South Circular Road at Chalker&#x27;s Corner at the south-eastern end of the district.

Since 1869 rail services have been available from Kew Gardens station. London Underground (District line) services run to Richmond and to central London. London Overground (Mildmay line) trains run to Richmond and (via Willesden Junction) to Stratford.

The 65, 110 and R68 bus routes serve Kew.

River bus services run from Kew Pier to Westminster Millennium Pier, Richmond and Hampton Court.

==Parks and open spaces==

*Kew Green is used by Kew Cricket Club for cricket matches in the summer.
*Kew Pond, near the northeast corner of Kew Green, believed to date from the tenth century, is originally thought to have been a natural pond fed from a creek of the tidal Thames. During high (spring) tides, sluice gates are opened to allow river water to fill the pond via an underground channel. The pond is concreted, rectangular in shape and contains an important reed bed habitat which is vital for conservation and resident water birds.
* North Sheen Recreation Ground in Dancer Road, known locally as &quot;The Rec&quot;, was originally part of an orchard belonging to the Popham Estate, owned by the Leyborne Pophams whose family seat was at Littlecote House, Wiltshire. Opened in June 1909 and extended in 1923, it now contains football pitches, a running track, a children&#x27;s paddling pool and two extensive playgrounds. It is also the home of a local football club, Kew Park Rangers. A sports pavilion was opened in September 2011.
*Pensford Field, previously playing fields of the former Gainsborough School, is now a nature reserve managed by Pensford Field Environmental Trust and also the home of Pensford Tennis Club and of Dose of Nature, a mental health and well-being charity.
* St Luke&#x27;s Open Space, a quiet sitting area and toddlers&#x27; play area, was previously a playground for a former Victorian primary school.
* Westerley Ware is at the foot of Kew Bridge. It was created as a memorial garden to the fallen in the First World War, and also has a grass area, three hard tennis courts and a children&#x27;s playground. Its name refers to the practice of netting weirs or &quot;wares&quot; to catch fish.

==Sport and leisure==
Kew&#x27;s several other sports clubs include:
* North Sheen Bowling Club on Marksbury Avenue
* Priory Park Club on Forest Road – tennis and (until 2017) bowls
* Putney Town Rowing Club on Townmead Road
* Richmond Gymnastics Association on Townmead Road

The nearest football club in the Premier League is Brentford FC, whose stadium, opened in 2021, is on the other side of Kew Bridge, near Kew Bridge station.

==Societies==
The Kew Horticultural Society, founded in 1938, organises an annual show in late August/early September as well as talks, events and outings throughout the year.

The Kew Society, founded in 1901 as the Kew Union, is a civic society that seeks to enhance the beauty of Kew and preserve its heritage. It reviews all planning applications in Kew with special regard to the architectural integrity and heritage of the neighbourhood, and plays an active role in the improvement of local amenities. The Society, which is a member of Civic Voice, organises community events including lectures and outings and produces a quarterly newsletter.

The Richmond Local History Society is concerned with the history of Kew, as well as that of Richmond, Petersham and Ham.

==Education==

===Primary schools===
* Darell Primary and Nursery School is on Darell Road and Niton Road. It opened in 1906, as the Darell Road Schools, at the southern end of what had been the Leyborne-Popham estate. It was Richmond Borough Council&#x27;s first primary school and was built in the Queen Anne Revival style, in brick with white stone facings. Although it has been extended several times, it is now the only Richmond borough primary school still in its historic original pre-1914 building.
* Kew Riverside Primary School, on Courtlands Avenue, opened in 2002.
* The King’s Church of England Primary School is in Cumberland Road, where it moved in 1969. In her will of 1719, Dorothy, Lady Capel of Kew House left to four trustees Perry Court Farm in Kent, which she had inherited from her father. One twelfth of the rent from the farm was to be given to St Anne&#x27;s Church to establish a school in Kew. In 1810, a &quot;Free School&quot; was opened in the church for 50 children, financed by subscribers who gave one guinea a year, in addition to a contribution by King George III. In 1824 the school moved to a site near the pond on Kew Green. The foundation stone was laid on 12 August, the birthday of King George IV, who gave £300 on condition that it be called &quot;The King&#x27;s Free School&quot;. Queen Victoria gave permission for it to be called &quot;The Queen&#x27;s School&quot; and decreed that its title should change with that of the monarch. In 2016, the building that had been created after the move to the Cumberland Road site in 1970 was demolished and a new structure installed in its place.

===Independent preparatory schools===
* Broomfield House School, on Broomfield Road, was founded in 1876.
* Kew College Prep, a co-educational school for 3- to 11-year-olds, was founded in 1927 by Mrs Ellen Upton in rooms over a shop in Kew. Mrs Upton&#x27;s young daughter was one of the first pupils. The school later moved to Cumberland Road. In 1953, Mrs Upton retired and sold the school to Mrs Hamilton-Spry who, in 1985, handed over the buildings to a charitable trust to ensure the school&#x27;s long term continuity.
* Kew Green Preparatory School, at Layton House, Ferry Lane, near Kew Green, opened in 2004.
* Unicorn School, established in 1970, is a co-educational, parent-owned independent preparatory school on Kew Road, opposite Kew Gardens.

===Former schools===
In the 19th century, Leopold Neumegen operated a Jewish school at Gloucester House in Kew after his earlier school in Highgate closed and when, for financial reasons, he needed to commence work again.

==Places of worship==
Four churches in Kew are currently in use:
Former churches include:
* Kew Baptist Church, a Grace Baptist church, was founded in 1861 in Richmond as Salem Baptist Church. It moved in 1973 to a new building on Windsor Road in Kew, adopting the name Kew Baptist Church in 1990, and closed in 2020.
* the late 19th-century Cambridge Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, previously known as the Gloucester Road Wesleyan Methodist Chapel and also known as Cambridge Road Methodist Church, which was in use from 1891 to 1969. It is now a private residence.
A late Victorian Salvation Army hall at 6 North Road, built in the style of a chapel, was converted into flats (1–5 Quiet Way) in the early 21st century.

==Cemeteries and crematorium==

Mortlake Crematorium and two cemeteries – North Sheen Cemetery and Mortlake Cemetery – are located in Kew. The crematorium serves the boroughs of Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames and the two cemeteries are managed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council.

<text>Kidbrooke is an area of south-east London, England, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich south-east of Charing Cross and north west of Eltham.

The district takes its name from the Kyd Brook, a watercourse which runs from Orpington to Lewisham, by which point it is part of the River Quaggy. It is a tributary to the River Ravensbourne.

==History==
Kidbrooke, derived from an Anglo-Saxon name meaning &#x27;the brook where the kites were seen,&#x27; indicates that the area was uninhabited at the time of naming. With its three streams and heavy, wet clay, Kidbrooke would have been unsuitable for Saxon settlement.

However, by the late 11th or 12th century, Kidbrooke had established a church and likely had a small population, although this presence didn&#x27;t endure. By 1428, the church lacked a priest, and by 1494, it had fallen into disrepair.

Remaining rural until the inauguration of Kidbrooke railway station in 1895, the region was primarily dedicated to farming until the 1930s. Significant development ensued thereafter, particularly following the construction of the Rochester Way.

===Housing===
The area contains a large amount of 1920s and 1930s domestic housing, developed partly as the Kidbrooke Park Estate, between Shooters Hill and Rochester Way.

A large RAF stores base, RAF Kidbrooke, formerly occupied much of the land around Kidbrooke railway station, north and south of the railway line. In 1965 the Government released most of the land to the Greater London Council for housing. The Ferrier Estate, built from 1968, was conceived to be a flagship scheme but became one of the largest and most deprived council housing developments in London.

The housing estate was demolished in 2012 and has been redeveloped as Kidbrooke Village, a development of 5,300 homes masterplanned by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands with Design and Build MEP contractor Cilantro Engineering.

==Features==

Immediately south of the former Ferrier Estate is Sutcliffe Park which includes a lake, acting as a flood defence, and created by partly releasing the Kyd Brook from concrete conduits underground in which it had run until 2006.

Rochester Way, a road which was built along much of the course of the old country lane Kidbrooke Lane, was intended as a bypass for Shooters Hill to the north. Rochester Way has itself now been bypassed by a dual carriageway – part of the A2 road – built in the 1980s over most of Kidbrooke Green. A small remaining piece of this open land, alongside the road, is now Kidbrooke Green Park, and adjacent to that, a small nature reserve managed by Greenwich Council. The nature reserve is visible, but not open to the public.

Little sign of the former RAF base remains. A handful of buildings survive, south of the houses of Nelson Mandela Road, to the north of the railway line, that escaped demolition when the Rochester Way Relief Road dual carriageway was constructed. These are currently used for additional collection storage by the National Maritime Museum, with some now removed to make way for a new purpose-built conservation facility, the Prince Philip Maritime Collections Centre, which opened in 2019.

To the west of this Thomas Tallis School is built on another part of the former base, the former site of a prisoner-of-war camp, barrage balloon centre, and then a military language-teaching facility. (There are several other military facilities in the general vicinity, which is also close to a surviving base in Woolwich, long home to the Royal Artillery and now to other parts of the British Army.)

==Transport==
===Rail===
Kidbrooke railway station provides the area with Southeastern services to London Victoria, London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street, Dartford and Slade Green.

===Buses===
Kidbrooke is served by London Buses routes 132, 178, 286, 335, 386 and B16. These connect it with areas including Bexleyheath, Blackheath, Eltham, Greenwich, Lewisham, North Greenwich, Sidcup, Welling and Woolwich.

===Roads===
The A2 road gives the area rapid access to the London Inner Ring Road, the South Circular Road and the M25 motorway.

* Wingfield School
* Kidbrooke Park
* Holy Family R.C.

<text>The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (often known by its initialism as RBKC) is an Inner London borough with royal status. It is the smallest borough in London and the second smallest district in England; it is one of the most densely populated administrative regions in the United Kingdom. It includes affluent areas such as Notting Hill, Kensington, South Kensington, Chelsea, and Knightsbridge.

The borough is immediately west of the City of Westminster and east of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. It contains major museums and universities in Albertopolis, department stores such as Harrods, Peter Jones and Harvey Nichols, and embassies in Belgravia, Knightsbridge and Kensington Gardens. The borough is home to the Notting Hill Carnival, Europe&#x27;s largest, and contains many of the most expensive residential properties in the world, as well as Kensington Palace, a British royal residence.

The local authority is Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council. Its motto, adapted from the opening words of Psalm 133, is , which translates roughly as &#x27;How good it is to dwell in unity&#x27;.

== History ==
Chelsea and Kensington were both ancient parishes in the historic county of Middlesex. From 1856 the two parishes were in the area governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards, with both Chelsea and Kensington being governed by their respective vestries. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, two of which were called Chelsea and Kensington, corresponding to the two parishes. The borough of Kensington was given the honorific title of royal borough in 1901.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963, which reorganised 86 boroughs and urban districts into 32 London boroughs and also created the Greater London Council. It was a merger of the old metropolitan boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington, and it inherited Kensington&#x27;s royal borough status. The new borough was originally intended to be called only &quot;Kensington&quot;, but after protests from thousands of Chelsea residents, the then Minister of Housing and Local Government, Sir Keith Joseph, announced on 2 January 1964 that the name of the new borough would be the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Of its history the council states: &quot;Despite the boroughs being separate originally, Kensington and Chelsea still retain their unique characters. Even the amalgamation of the two boroughs, unpopular as it was at the time, has been accepted. Today conservation combined with the adoption of sympathetic new architecture is seen as a key objective. In every corner of the borough signs of its history can be seen: from Grade 1 listed buildings Kensington Palace and the Royal Hospital, Chelsea to others recalled in street names such as Pottery Lane and Hippodrome Mews.&quot;

In 200 years the area has been transformed from a &quot;rural idyll&quot; to a thriving part of the modern metropolis. Chelsea had originally been countryside upon which Thomas More built Beaufort House. He came to Chelsea in 1520 and built the house, which in his day had two courtyards laid out between the house and the river, and in the north of the site acres of gardens and orchards were planted. It was from here in 1535 that More was taken to the Tower and beheaded later that year. This area of Cheyne Walk continued its historic significance; nearby Crosby Hall sits on the river near the Church of Thomas More, and what was once Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s residence remains on Cheyne Row.

Kensington&#x27;s royal borough status was granted in 1901 as it included of Kensington Palace, where Queen Victoria was born in 1819 and lived until her accession in 1837. Commissioned by King William III, Christopher Wren enlarged and rebuilt the original house in 1689, turning it into a fitting royal residence. With the King came many court officials, servants and followers. Kensington Square, until then a failing venture, became a popular residential area. The Palace was regularly used by reigning monarchs until 1760 and since then by members of the Royal family. Kensington&#x27;s royal borough status was inherited by the new borough.

In the 19th century the last emperor of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Duleep Singh who was brought to England as a child following the Second Anglo-Sikh War, along with the Koh-i-noor diamond, lived in the borough at 53 Holland Park, while his mother Maharani Jind Kaur (wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh) lived at the nearby Abingdon House till her death in 1846.

During the Second World War civilians suffered great hardship; there were some 800 deaths and 40,000 injuries. A huge army of civilian volunteers was raised, including Auxiliary Fire Service, Red Cross, Air Raid Wardens and Rescue Services. During the Blitz much damage was caused by explosive and incendiary bombs, especially along Chelsea&#x27;s riverside. But worse was to come in 1944 with the arrival of the V2 rockets, or flying bombs. Among the buildings either destroyed or seriously damaged, usually with terrible loss of life, were Chelsea Old Church, Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer, Our Lady of Victories, St Mary Abbots, St Stephens Hospital, St Mary Abbots Hospital, Sloane Square tube station, World&#x27;s End, the Royal Hospital and Holland House.

==Governance==

The local authority is Kensington and Chelsea Council, which is based at Kensington Town Hall on Horton Street.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the West Central constituency.

=== UK Parliament ===
The borough is divided between two constituencies represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Kensington and Bayswater, held by Joe Powell for the Labour Party, and Chelsea and Fulham (partly in Hammersmith &amp; Fulham), held by Ben Coleman for the Labour Party.

At the 2005 General Election, the borough was divided differently:
* Kensington and Chelsea, held by Sir Malcolm Rifkind for the Conservative Party, and
* Regent&#x27;s Park and Kensington North (partly in City of Westminster), held by Karen Buck for the Labour Party.

Rifkind held the Kensington seat until the 2015 General Election when he stood down after becoming embroiled in a scandal, uncovered by a television investigation, over accepting money in return for access to influential British diplomats and politicians.

== Demographics ==

At the 2011 census, the borough had a population of 158,649 who were 71 percent White, 10 percent Asian, 5 percent of multiple ethnic groups, 4 percent Black African and 3 percent Black Caribbean. It is the least populated of the 32 London boroughs. Due to its high French population it has long held the unofficial title of the 21st arrondissement of Paris.
In 2005, the borough had more of its land covered by domestic buildings than anywhere else in England at 19%, over half the national average. It also had the fifth highest proportion of land covered by non-domestic buildings at 12 percent.

As of 2010 statistics released by the Office for National Statistics showed that life expectancy at birth for females was 89.8 years in 2008–2010, the highest in the United Kingdom. Male life expectancy at birth for the same period was 85.1 years. The figures in 1991–1993 were significantly lower: 73.0 years for males (ranking 301st in the nation) and 80.0 for females (ranking 129th). Further investigation indicates a 12-year gap in life expectancy between the affluent wards of Chelsea (Royal Hospital, Hans Town) and the most northerly wards of North Kensington (Golborne, Dalgarno), which have high levels of social housing and poverty.

The borough has a higher proportion (16.6 percent) of high earners (over £60,000 per year) than any other local government district in the country. It has the highest proportion of workers in the financial sector and the lowest proportion working in the retail sector.

In December 2006 Sport England published a survey which showed that the borough&#x27;s residents were the fourth most active in England in sports and other fitness activities. 27.9 percent of the population participate at least three times a week for 30 minutes.

A 2017 study by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that Kensington &amp; Chelsea has the greatest income inequality of any London Borough. Private rent for low earners was also found to be the least affordable in London. However, the borough&#x27;s poverty rate of 28% is roughly in line with the London-wide average.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
The following shows the religious identity of residents residing in Kensington and Chelsea according to the 2001, 2011 and the 2021 censuses.

===Places of worship===
The borough has a number of notable churches, including:
* Brompton Oratory – &quot;Roman Catholic&quot;
* Chelsea Old Church (All Saints) – &quot;Church of England&quot;
* Holy Trinity Brompton – &quot;Church of England&quot;
* St Columba&#x27;s Church, Pont Street – &quot;Church of Scotland&quot;
* St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea, Sydney Street – &quot;Church of England&quot;
* St Mary Abbots – &quot;Church of England&quot;
* St Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral – &quot;Greek Orthodox Church&quot;

It is home to a small Spanish and Portuguese synagogue, several mosques and the Sikh Central Gurudwara in Holland Park. There are two Armenian churches – Saint Sarkis Armenian Church and Church of Saint Yeghiche. Westminster Synagogue is also partially located in the borough.

==Transport==
===Underground===

The borough has 12 tube stations, on five of the 11 London Underground lines: the Central line, Circle line, District line, Hammersmith &amp; City line and Piccadilly line. The borough contains the stations of , , , , , , , , , , and .
====Crossrail====

Chelsea (SW3, SW10 and partly SW1) has significantly less Underground access than Kensington, the only station within Chelsea being Sloane Square. There have for some time been long-term plans for a Chelsea-Hackney line, with a station in the King&#x27;s Road near Chelsea Town Hall, and possibly another at Sloane Square. As of June 2019, the plans for Crossrail 2 materialising show the proposed route tunnelling through Chelsea and featuring the planned station on the site of Dovehouse Green. The future of this station, being the only fully new station on the proposed line, remains ambiguous; initial reports of the station idea having been scrapped seem to be contradicted by the station&#x27;s placement on an official Transport for London map for the route.

A Crossrail station on the original Crossrail route, from Paddington to Reading, has been proposed and endorsed by the council. This station would be located near the northern end of , and would serve the areas of North Kensington and Kensal. The council supports this station concept as it would renew infrastructure and build regeneration benefits in the area.

===National Rail and Overground===

 and are the nearest major railway termini; National Rail stations in the borough are and (and partly ), both served by London Overground and Southern.

===Buses===

Many London bus routes pass through the borough, most of them along King&#x27;s Road, Fulham Road, Kensington High Street and Ladbroke Grove.

===Cycling===

Kensington and Chelsea council has been criticised for its lack of support for cycle lanes and active travel in general. In 2019 the council vetoed a flagship programme by Transport for London for safer walking and cycling in the borough. In 2020 it scrapped a cycle lane along Kensington High Street just seven weeks after it was installed.

=== Travel to work ===

In March 2011 the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: underground, metro, light rail, tram, 23.6 percent of all residents aged 16–74; driving a car or van, 8.2 percent; on foot, 8.2 percent; bus, minibus or coach, 8.0 percent; work mainly at or from home, 7.0 percent; bicycle, 3.1 percent; train, 2.1 percent.

== Social housing and Grenfell tower fire ==

The RBKC is a major provider of social housing in the borough owning 9,459 properties. Of these over 73 percent are tenanted, with the remainder being leasehold. The management of this housing was devolved to the Kensington and Chelsea TMO (KCTMO), a tenant management organisation. Properties included Trellick Tower.

The 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, in which one public-housing tower of the estate Grenfell Tower was completely destroyed and 72 lives were lost, drew international attention to the borough. After widespread criticism of the borough council&#x27;s response to the fire, responsibility for providing services to those affected by the fire was taken away from RBKC. Prime Minister Theresa May previously branded the response to the tragedy &quot;not good enough&quot;, with Whitehall civil servants drafted in as part of a beefed-up operation in the local area.
Anna Stec who gave evidence as an expert witness to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry has urged the authorities to test rescue workers, nearby residents and survivors for carcinogenic chemicals following the fire.

<text>Kilburn is an area in North West London, in the London Boroughs of Camden, Brent and the City of Westminster. Kilburn High Road railway station lies 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-west of Charing Cross.

Kilburn developed from a linear hamlet that grew up on ancient Watling Street (the modern A5 Road), the hamlet took its name from Kilburn Priory, which was built on the banks of Kilburn Brook. Watling Street forms the contemporary boundary between the boroughs of Brent and Camden.

The area has London&#x27;s highest Irish population, as well as a sizable Afro-Caribbean population, and was once home to the black civil rights leader Billy Strachan.

==Geographic and administrative context==
Kilburn has never been an administrative unit and has therefore never had any formally defined boundaries. The area, which took its name from a nearby watercourse and eponymous priory, developed from a linear hamlet along Watling Street (here called Kilburn High Road) which was the boundary of the Ancient parishes of Willesden – to the west of Watling Street and now part of Brent, and Hampstead to the east (now part of Camden). These parishes subsequently became a Municipal and a Metropolitan Borough respectively (based on the same boundaries), before merging with neighbouring areas in 1965 to form modern London Boroughs of which they are now part.
If Kilburn is taken to extend into the City of Westminster then the historic districts it overlaps are Paddington, to the west of Watling Street, and Marylebone to the east of it. Both of these areas became part of the City of Westminster in 1965.
The electoral wards of &#x27;Kilburn (Camden)&#x27; and &#x27;Kilburn (Brent)&#x27; cover some of the area.
Much of the area is in the NW6 postcode area, and by some interpretations the area extends into W9; however these do not define the Kilburn – post code areas were never intended to delineate districts and Kilburn (like many London districts) overlaps with others – some which have a history of formal definition (e.g. Willesden, Hampstead) and others which do not (e.g. Brondesbury in Willesden).

==History==
Kilburn High Road originated as an ancient trackway, part of a route between the Brittonic settlements now known as Canterbury and St Albans. Under Roman rule, the route was paved. In Anglo-Saxon times the road became known as Watling Street.

Kilburn Priory was built on the banks of a stream variously recorded as &quot;Cuneburna&quot;, &quot;Kelebourne&quot; and &quot;Cyebourne&quot; (in the latter source most other places with the phonetic sound were rendered in writing &quot;Cy&quot; such as &quot;Cynestone&quot; (Kingston)). The stream flowed from Hampstead through this parish then through Paddington – specifically through areas that became &quot;Westbourne&quot;, &quot;Bayswater&quot; and Hyde Park – South Kensington and the narrow east part of Chelsea into the Thames. The first two names perhaps imply meanings of &quot;King&#x27;s Bourne&quot; and &quot;Cattle Bourne&quot;. The word &quot;Bourne&quot; is the southern variant of &quot;burn&quot; (any small &quot;river&quot;), as still commonly used in the technical term, &quot;winterbourne&quot; - a watercourse which tends to dry up in dry periods. The river is known today as the Westbourne. From the 1850s many of its feeder ditches were diverted into combined sewers feeding away to the east; it was otherwise piped underground and became one of London&#x27;s underground rivers.

The name &quot;Kilburn&quot; was first recorded in 1134 as &quot;Cuneburna&quot;, referring to the priory which had been built on the site of the cell of a hermit known as Godwyn.
Godwyn had built his hermitage by the Kilburn river during the reign (1100-1135) of Henry I, and both his hermitage and the priory took their name from the river.

Kilburn Priory was a small community of nuns, probably Augustinian canonesses. It was founded in 1134 at the Kilburn river crossing on Watling Street (the modern-day junction of Kilburn High Road and Belsize Road). Kilburn Priory&#x27;s position on Watling Street meant that it became a popular resting point for pilgrims heading for the shrines at St Albans and Willesden. Henry VIII&#x27;s administration dissolved the priory in 1536–37, and nothing remains of it today 
except the name of Abbey Road (in nearby St John&#x27;s Wood), named from a track which once led to the priory.
The priory lands included a mansion and a &quot;hostium&quot; (a guesthouse), which may have been the origin of the Red Lion pub, thought to have been founded in 1444. Opposite, the Bell Inn opened around 1600, on the site of the old mansion.

The fashion for taking &quot;medicinal waters&quot; in the 18th century came to Kilburn when a well of chalybeate waters (water impregnated with iron) was discovered near the Bell Inn in 1714. In an attempt to compete with the nearby Hampstead Well, gardens and a &quot;great room&quot; opened to promote the well, and its waters were promoted in journals of the day as cure for &quot;stomach ailments&quot;:

In the 19th century the wells declined, but the Kilburn Wells remained popular as a tea garden. The Bell was demolished and rebuilt in 1863, the building which stands there today. The Kilburn stretch of Watling Street, now called Edgware Road and Kilburn High Road, was gradually built up with inns and farm houses. Despite the discovery of the medicinal well in 1714, and the construction of gardens and a fine room to exploit the water, Kilburn did not attract any significant building until around 1819 in the area near St John&#x27;s Wood. These 19th century developments mark the emergence of the nucleated roadside hamlet from which the modern district of Kilburn developed.

Between 1839 and 1856 the newsagent and future First Lord of the Admiralty William Henry Smith lived in a house to the west of Kilburn High Road. Solomon Barnett developed much of the area in the last decades of the 19th century, naming many of the streets after places in the West Country (e.g. Torbay) or after popular poets of the day (e.g. Tennyson) in honour of his wife.

The funeral of Michael Gaughan, an Irish republican and a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) who died from hunger strike in 1974, took place on 8 June 1974. Over 3,000 mourners lined the streets of Kilburn and marched behind his coffin - which was flanked by an IRA &quot;honour guard&quot; - to a Requiem Mass held in the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The &quot;Biddy Mulligan&#x27;s&quot; pub on High Road, which was popular among the local Irish population, was bombed in retaliation on 21 December 1975 by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), an Ulster loyalist group during the Troubles of Northern Ireland. Although there were 90 people in the pub at the time of the bomb, there were few injuries. It was the only loyalist bombing in London during the conflict in Northern Ireland.

==Demographics==
Kilburn has a number of different ethnic groups, including people of Irish, Afro-Caribbean, Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Eritrean and Ethiopian descent. As the area is split between more than one London borough, statistics are gathered from different parts of Kilburn.

The Kilburn ward of Brent was 28% White British, 17% White Other, and 12% Black African in the 2011 census. The Kilburn ward of Camden was 35% White British and 19% White Other. The Maida Vale ward of Westminster was 38% White British and 22% White Other.

4.7% of the population was born in Ireland with an even higher percentage of second-generation (born in England of Irish descent) people, giving it the highest Irish population of any London area. Irish community activities, pubs, local GAA sports clubs, and annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations are prominent in parts of the area. The 2007 Irish-language film &quot;Kings&quot; has been associated with Kilburn, a number of scenes were filmed there, and is based on Jimmy Murphy&#x27;s play, &quot;The Kings of the Kilburn High Road&quot;.

===Housing and inequality===

Kilburn has a high degree of socio-economic inequality, as it is home to both large and expensive Victorian and Edwardian houses as well as deprived, often run-down council housing estates.

==Landmarks==
===Kilburn High Road===

Kilburn High Road is the main road in Kilburn. It follows a part of the line of the Roman route, Iter III in the Antonine Itinerary, which later took the Anglo-Saxon name Watling Street. This was based on an earlier Celtic route from Verlamion to Durovernum Cantiacorum, modern day St Albans and Canterbury.

Running roughly north-west to south-east, it forms the boundary between the London boroughs of Camden to the east and Brent to the west. It is the section of the Edgware Road (itself part of the A5) between Shoot Up Hill and Maida Vale.

There are two railway stations on Kilburn High Road: Brondesbury station (London Overground on the Mildmay line). Approximately 1.25 km (nearly a mile) further south is Kilburn High Road station (also London Overground, on the Watford DC Line). Kilburn Park Underground station, on the Bakerloo line, lies a little west of the southern end of the High Road. Kilburn Underground station sits on the northern side of the intersection of Christchurch Avenue and Kilburn High Road, which marks the High Road&#x27;s northern boundary.

The green space of Kilburn Grange Park is located to the east side of Kilburn High Road.

The name of Ian Dury&#x27;s first band, Kilburn and the High Roads, refers to this road, as does the Flogging Molly song, &quot;Kilburn High Road&quot; and the Shack song, &quot;Kilburn High Road&quot;.

===Gaumont State Cinema===

A landmark in Kilburn High Road is the Grade II* listed Art Deco Gaumont State Cinema, designed by George Coles and opened in 1937. It was the biggest auditorium in Europe at the time, with seating for 4,004 people. For twenty years, the building was run as a bingo hall by Mecca Bingo. In December 2007, it was purchased by Ruach City Church.

===The Kiln Theatre===
The Kiln Theatre is located on Kilburn High Road north of Buckley Road. It was opened in 1980 as the Tricycle Theatre in a converted Foresters&#x27; Hall, and was renamed the Kiln in April 2018. The Kiln complex includes a cinema. The theatre also runs an extensive community outreach programme. For nearly 30 years (1984-2012) the Tricycle was run by Nicolas Kent who, as artistic director, built the theatre&#x27;s reputation for political dramas including verbatim plays based on recent events, and for plays that reflected the experiences of local communities - Irish, Afro-Caribbean and Asian. In 2012, Indhu Rubasingham succeeded Kent as artistic director. She continued the theatre&#x27;s radical reputation. She also oversaw a major revamp of the building and, controversially, renamed the theatre the Kiln. In 2024 she left the Kiln, having been appointed director of the Royal National Theatre. She was succeeded at the Kiln by Amit Sharma. Sharma said: &quot;&quot;The Kiln is a theatre right at the heart of its community – a beacon for the people of Brent, bringing audiences to the borough from across London, the UK and internationally. There’s a magic that happens&quot; &quot;on that stage.&quot;&quot;

He outlined his first season and his plans for the theatre in a YouTube video.

Other buildings

To the south, the Kilburn skyline is dominated by the Gothic spire of St. Augustine&#x27;s, Kilburn. Completed in 1880 by the architect John Loughborough Pearson, the church has an ornate Victorian interior, a carved stone reredos and screen and stained glass, adjacent to its partners, St Augustine&#x27;s Primary and Secondary Schools. The church is sometimes nicknamed &quot;the Cathedral of North London&quot; due to its size - at the time of construction, it was the third-largest place of worship in London, after St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.

Located at 10 Cambridge Avenue, just off Kilburn High Road, is &quot;The Animals WW1 memorial dispensary&quot;. The building itself dates back to the early 1930s. Formally opened in March 1931, it treated over 6,000 animals in its first year. The front of the building has a large bronze plaque above the door as a memorial to animals killed in the first world war. It&#x27;s an impressive piece of bronze sculpture by F Brook Hitch of Hertford. Next door at 12-14 Cambridge Avenue, is one of the only surviving London examples of a &quot;Tin Tabernacle&quot; from 1863, which is currently used by a local arts charity. This very unusual building, originally built as St. James&#x27; Episcopal Chapel, is Grade II listed and is open to the public on Saturdays.

Just to the south of St. Augustine&#x27;s on Carlton Vale stands the rebuilt Carlton Tavern, a pub built in 1920-21 for Charrington Brewery and thought to be the work of the architect Frank J Potter. The building, noted for its unaltered 1920s interiors and faience tile exterior, was being considered by Historic England for Grade II listing when it was unexpectedly demolished in March 2015 by the property developer CLTX Ltd to make way for a new block of flats. The pub was subsequently rebuilt and re-opened following a community campaign and planning appeals.

205 High Road was home to the Irish pub &quot;Biddy Mulligan&#x27;s&quot;. It was built in 1862 as was originally known as &quot;The Victoria Tavern&quot;. It was renamed in the 1970s, with the name Biddy Mulligan taken from a character of Irish comedian Jimmy O&#x27;Dea, a character dressed as a female street seller in Dublin from the 1930s onwards. The pub was bombed on 21 December 1975 by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), an Ulster loyalist group that fought against Irish republicans in Northern Ireland (The Troubles). The pub was later renamed as &quot;Biddy&#x27;s&quot;, before briefly turning into an Australian sports bar called &quot;Southern K&quot;, and then closing in 2009 to make way for a new Ladbrokes branch.

==Transport==
===Tube/train===
Kilburn High Road is served by several railway lines which traverse the road in an east–west direction, connecting the area with central London and outer north-west London suburbs. The railways were first introduced to Kilburn in 1852 when the London &amp; North Western Railway opened Kilburn &amp; Maida Vale station (today&#x27;s Kilburn High Road railway station), followed by two stations opened in the Brondesbury area of Kilburn by the Hampstead Junction Railway (1860) and the Metropolitan Railway (1879). Numerous plans were drawn up at the turn of the 20th century to construct an underground railway tunnel under the length of the Edgware Road and Kilburn High Road, including an unusual scheme to build a type of subterranean monorail roller coaster, but these proposals were abandoned.

Today, Kilburn is served by London Underground and London Overground from the following stations:

* Kilburn Park station (London Underground Bakerloo line) - Central Kilburn
* Brondesbury station (London Overground Mildmay line) - North Kilburn
* Kilburn High Road station (London Overground Lioness line) - Central Kilburn

Despite its name, Kilburn tube station (Jubilee line) is actually in Brondesbury Park rather than in Kilburn itself.

===Bus===
Kilburn is served by many bus routes that go along the High Road. Most routes come south from Cricklewood, and serve various points in central and west London.

==Media==
The &quot;Brent &amp; Kilburn Times&quot; and the &quot;Camden New Journal&quot; provide local news in print and online forms.
In the 2017 film, &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot;, Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s character, Mimi, explains that she moved from Belsize Park to Kilburn because it felt more real. 

==Sport==

Kilburn is home to Kilburn Cosmos RFC
*South Kilburn F.C. play in the Combined Counties League
*Kilburn is home to Kilburn Gaels GAA Hurling Club.
* Kilburn Football Club play in the Middlesex County League, and hold regular training sessions in Grange Park.
*One of the 12 founder members of the Football Association was formed in Kilburn in 1863. It was referred to as the N.N. Club or N.N. Kilburn, &quot;N.N.&quot; being thought to stand for &quot;Non Name&quot;. It supplied the first president of the Football Association.

<text>Kingsbury is a district of northwest London in the London Borough of Brent. Its ancient scope stretches to include various distinct areas that were once small villages until the inter-war period. Kingsbury was in 2001 a ward and in 2011 was identifiable with the Fryent and Barnhill wards approximately. Today it forms a quiet suburb between Fryent Country Park to the west and the Brent Reservoir to the east, along with a tube station of the same name and accompanying shopping district on the western side. The postal district is NW9 which it shares with Colindale and West Hendon.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kingsbury&quot; means &quot;The King&#x27;s fortification&quot;.

==History==
Kingsbury was an ancient parish of a fairly modest in the Hundred of Gore and county of Middlesex. Following local government redrawing of electoral wards Kingsbury corresponds to the Fryent and Barnhill wards and in all of its various older guises, a minority or all of the Queensbury ward.

The early English kings had parted with their manor of Kingsbury long before the Conquest. An estate called Tunworth, in the northern part of Kingsbury parish, was granted by Edwy to his thegn Lyfing in 957. By 1066 it probably formed part of the manor of Kingsbury, which was then held by Wlward White, a thegn of the Confessor, and passed from him to Ernulf of Hesdin who died in 1097 and his lands passed to the family of Walter of Salisbury. Thereafter the overlordship of Kingsbury descended with Edgware manor. By 1086 on the Domesday survey of property, Ernulf&#x27;s manor in Kingsbury had been subinfeudated to Albold as Lord. It was not mentioned again until 1317, when, under the name of the manor of Kingsbury, it belonged to Baldwin Poleyn of Tebworth.

Kingsbury developed little in housing and population in the 19th century, remaining a polyfocal village. In this age, Oliver Goldsmith, writer and playwright, lived at Hyde Farm, Kingsbury (1771–1774); the third Lord Mansfield was buried at St. Andrew&#x27;s churchyard in 1840.

Although it lay close to London, development started slowly, and it was not until after the First World War that the district became built up. An aircraft industry was established in the part of Kingsbury adjacent to Hendon aerodrome during the war, while the road network was improved to cater for the British Empire Exhibition in nearby Wembley in 1924. The number of inhabited houses in the civil parish increased from just 140 in 1901 to 3,937 in 1931. By 1951 this had risen to 11,776. Between 1921 and 1931 Kingsbury&#x27;s population increased by 796%.

Population growth meant the existing parish church, built in 1884, dedicated to the Holy Innocents, and adjacent to the more historic Old St Andrew&#x27;s church, became too small. It was replaced during the 1930s. The current church, completed to designs by Samuel Daukes in 1847, had originally been constructed in Wells Street in central London but after its use declined it was deconstructed, transported and rebuilt (by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts, directed by architect William Adam Forsyth) in its entirety in Kingsbury in 1933–34.
John Logie Baird&#x27;s experimental television transmissions from the United Kingdom to Berlin, Germany were transmitted from the stable block of Kingsbury Manor; this later housed the Veterans Club, and is now a children&#x27;s nursery.

From 1923 to 1979 Kingsbury Road was the location of the Vanden Plas specialist motor body works, body makers for Bentley and later part of Austin, BMC, and British Leyland. The site is now Kingsbury Trading Estate.
A congregation of Jews affiliated to the United Synagogue is first recorded in Kingsbury in 1939. In 1942 Eden Lodge at Kingsbury Green was registered for worship, becoming Kingsbury district synagogue in 1954.

===Local government===
In 1894, the area of the medieval ancient parish of Kingsbury was included in the urban district of Wembley. However, as Kingsbury had only three councillors on the urban district council to Wembley&#x27;s nine, Kingsbury&#x27;s councillors felt the needs of the area were not well-served. In 1900 Kingsbury became a separate urban district with six councillors. The new council was immediately involved in controversy and in 1906 it failed to make a rate or meet its financial commitments. Following an inquiry initiated by ratepayers, the councillors numbered nine, not halting fiscal accusations directed towards the initial three councillors.

In 1934 the Kingsbury Urban District was abolished and merged once more in Wembley Urban District. The urban district became a municipal borough in 1937 and in 1965 the area became part of the London Borough of Brent.

==Locale and amenities==
===Station area===

Kingsbury tube station on the Jubilee line is located in the western part of the district. This part of the road with an urban atmosphere contains supermarkets, banks, Arabic and Indian food and vegetable shops, and other businesses for the surrounding community. There is also a council-run library here. At its western end is Kingsbury Circle, a roundabout where roads leading to Wembley Park, Kenton &amp; Harrow, and Queensbury &amp; Stanmore along with Kingsbury Road meet.The surrounding area has places to dine.

This area remained agricultural until the Metropolitan Railway extension to Stanmore opening the station in 1932. This effectively caused further development in the station&#x27;s vicinity and a new population centre for Kingsbury. The Kingsbury Odeon cinema opened in 1934 and existed until 1972 - today it is an Aldi supermarket. A public house called the Prince of Wales existed in front of the roundabout, which was demolished and replaced by a Tesco supermarket and flats in 2008.

===Fryent Country Park===
A major part of the district is the large Fryent Country Park which contains fields, woods, a fish pond, and a farm, and adjoins Barn Hill to the south.

===Kingsbury Green and Fryent===
The centre of Kingsbury Green which is today around the Kingsbury Road/Church Lane crossing was historically the centre of Kingsbury in the 15th century, built 1 mile north from the former settlement at Blackbird Hill. To its south, Church Lane leads to the St Andrew&#x27;s parish church, built in 1933. In Slough Lane and Buck Lane there exist 1920s timbered houses designed by Ernest Trowbridge .

On the east side of the green is the Kingsbury Trading Estate, which formerly housed a United Dairies depot. This area was once an aerodrome run by the Barningham brothers under their company Kingsbury Aviation, until the 1920s. Afterwards the site was taken by Vanden Plas. The Kingsbury Works site continued manufacturing vehicles until it closed in 1979. On the west side of the green lies Kingsbury Synagogue.

Fryent (between Kingsbury Green and Blackbird Hill) meets the Welsh Harp to its east and has a road crossing the reservoir towards West Hendon. This part in the south retains traces of the district&#x27;s quiet, wooded appearance.

===Roe Green Village===

The Roe Green Garden Village is located to the east of Roe Green Park. In 1968 the area became a conservation area and it retains the atmosphere of a historic village green. The garden suburb estate was originally built during the First World War for workers at the nearby Aircraft Manufacturing Company. The rest of the area was opened up by the early 1930s.

The area is next to a previous medieval village called Roe Green, at the junctions of Stag Lane, Hay Lane and Bacon Lane, of which little remains.

The Kingsbury Manor in Roe Green Park, built in 1899, is today Grade II listed. Roe Green Park is community maintained by the Barnhill Conservation Group.

===Blackbird Hill===

Blackbird Hill is the ancient centre of Kingsbury which is today the very southern end of the district, separating west–east Wembley Park and Neasden. Today it is an important road that connects various suburbs in and around Kingsbury and Wembley to the North Circular Road. Little remains of the medieval village: the southern part was redeveloped into shops in the inter-war period, while the former farmhouse was demolished in the 1950s to make way for a public house, The Blackbird, later renamed Blarney Stone, which itself was demolished in 2011. The building of the old St Andrew&#x27;s Church still exists on Old Church Lane.

Because of its location it is often referred to as being in Wembley Park or Neasden.

===The Hyde===

Holy Innocents church is located on Kingsbury Road, next to Oliver Goldsmith Primary School and opposite the Silver Jubilee Park. Next to the park is a large mandir complex including offices that opened in 2014 and combines Indian architecture with eco friendly technology. The community of the mandir moved over from a previous site located in Golders Green.

==Demography==

Kingsbury has large Asian and Irish communities. The local crime rate is average to below-average compared to London overall.

The 2011 census showed that the Fryent ward&#x27;s largest ethnic group was Indian at 21%. Whites as a whole form 34% (20% Black Caribbean, 14% Other, 6% Black African). 11% was Other Asian. 41% were Christian, 21% Muslim and 20% Hindu. The Welsh Harp ward, which covers southern areas of Kingsbury Green, was 17% White Other, 17% Indian, and 16% White British.

==In film, literature and music==
The first two series of BBC children&#x27;s drama &quot;Grange Hill&quot; were filmed at Kingsbury High School. Video of &quot;Round Here&quot;, about George Michael&#x27;s childhood, features Roe Green Park, Roe Green Primary School and other local landmarks.

<doc id="94153" wikidata="Q26328" url="?curid=94153" title="Knightsbridge">
<text>Knightsbridge is a residential and retail district in central London, south of Hyde Park. It is identified in the London Plan as one of two international retail centres in London, alongside the West End. Knightsbridge is also the name of the roadway which runs near the south side of Hyde Park from Hyde Park Corner.

Knightsbridge is an affluent district in London with a rich history and high property prices. The name has Old English origins, meaning &quot;bridge of the young men or retainers.&quot; The area was initially divided between local authorities and has been home to several parishes. Knightsbridge has been associated with exclusive shops including Harrod’s and Harvey Nichols, banks catering to wealthy individuals, renowned restaurants, and high-end salons. Property prices in the district are among the highest in the world, with the most expensive apartment at One Hyde Park selling for £100 million in 2007.

Knightsbridge is located between Exhibition Road and Sloane Street, with its southern border along Brompton Road, Beauchamp Place, and the western section of Pont Street. The district has been a target for high-profile crimes throughout history, including the Spaghetti House siege, the Walton&#x27;s Restaurant bombing, and the Knightsbridge Security Deposit robbery. It is served by the Knightsbridge station on the Piccadilly line and the Sloane Square station on the District and Circle lines.

==Toponymy==
Knightsbridge is an ancient name, spelt in a variety of ways in Saxon and Old English, such as &quot;Cnihtebricge&quot; (c. 1050); &quot;Knichtebrig&quot; (1235); &quot;Cnichtebrugge&quot; (13th century); and &quot;Knyghtesbrugg&quot; (1364). The meaning is &quot;bridge of the young men or retainers,&quot; from the Old English &quot;cniht&quot; (genitive case plural –a) and &quot;brycg&quot;. &quot;Cniht&quot;, in pre-Norman days, did not have the later meaning of a warrior on horseback, but simply meant a youth. The allusion may be to a place where &quot;cnihtas&quot; congregated: bridges and wells seem always to have been favourite gathering places of young people, and the original bridge was where one of the old roads to the west crossed the River Westbourne. However, there is possibly a more specific reference to the important &quot;cnihtengild&quot; (&#x27;guild of &quot;cnihtas&quot;‘) in 11th-century London and to the limits of its jurisdiction (certainly Knightsbridge was one of the limits of the commercial jurisdiction of the City of London in the 12th century).

== History ==

Knightsbridge was a hamlet located primarily in the parish of St Margaret (detached) and partly in St Martin in the Fields (the part that later became St George Hanover Square). It also extended into the parishes of Kensington and Chelsea. It was therefore divided between local authorities from a very early time.

In the time of Edward I, the manor of Knightsbridge appertained to the abbey of Westminster. It was named after a crossing of the River Westbourne, which is now an underground river. It is recorded that the citizens of London met Matilda of England at the Knight&#x27;s Bridge in 1141.

From 1885 to 1887, as a result of the opening of trade between Britain and the Far East, Humphreys&#x27; Hall in Knightsbridge hosted an exhibition of Japanese culture in a setting built to resemble a traditional Japanese village. The exhibition was very popular, with over 250,000 visitors during its early months. Japanese artisans illustrated &quot;the manners, customs and art-industries of their country, attired in their national and picturesque costumes. Magnificently decorated and illuminated Buddhist temple. Five o&#x27;clock tea in the Japanese tea-house. Japanese Musical and other Entertainments. Every-day Life as in Japan&quot;. W. S. Gilbert and his wife attended the exhibition, which is said to have inspired him to write &quot;The Mikado&quot;. When the Mikado requests of Ko-Ko the address of his son (Nanki-Poo) after Ko-Ko tells the Mikado that Nanki-Poo has &quot;gone abroad&quot;, Ko-Ko replies that Nanki-Poo has gone to Knightsbridge.

== Geography ==

Knightsbridge is east of Exhibition Road and west of Sloane Street. Brompton Road, Beauchamp Place and the western section of Pont Street serve roughly as its southern border together with their adjacent gardens and squares such as Ovington Square, Lennox Gardens and Cadogan Square. South of this area, the district fades into Chelsea while Belgravia lies to the east and South Kensington to the west.

== Economy ==
Knightsbridge is home to many expensive shops, including the department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols, and flagship stores of many British and international fashion houses, including those of London-based shoe designers Jimmy Choo and Manolo Blahnik, and two Prada stores. The district also has banks that cater to wealthy individuals. Some of London&#x27;s most renowned restaurants are here, as well as many exclusive hair and beauty salons, antiques and antiquities dealers, and chic bars and clubs. One of Bonhams auction houses is located in Knightsbridge.

=== Property ===
The district and the road itself, which is the only definitive place within it, is small, which assists its cachet: more than half of the zone closest to its tube station (and nearer to no others) is Knightsbridge Underground station. Knightsbridge had in its park side, east and west gold-coloured blocks of exceptional wealth in philanthropist Charles Booth&#x27;s late Victorian Poverty Map, formerly excluding Brompton Road to the west but extending well into Piccadilly, St James&#x27;s to the east. Knightsbridge is home to many of the world&#x27;s richest people and has some of the highest property prices in the world. In 2014 a terrace of 427m2 sold for £15,950,000, a home in Montpelier Square. The average asking price for all the properties in slightly wider SW7 was £4,348,911 (as at Autumn 2014). On-street parking spaces have sold for as much as £300,000 for a 94-year lease. Fourteen of Britain&#x27;s two hundred most expensive streets are in the neighbourhood, as defined by &quot;The Times&quot;.

====One Hyde Park====
In February 2007, the world&#x27;s most expensive apartment at One Hyde Park, sold off plan for £100 million, bought by a Qatari prince, and another apartment at the same place in February 2009, at almost the same price, was bought by a Qatari prince. Apartments of this secure, optimum specification, address equate to in excess of £4,000 per square foot (£43,000 per square metre).

In 2014, a 16,000 ft2 two-storey penthouse in One Hyde Park sold for £140 million.

====History of property construction====
Land in Knightsbridge is for the most part identified by City of Westminster (and by the RBKC, where former Brompton parts are included) as strengthened planning law-governed Conservation Areas: &#x27;Albert Gate&#x27;, &#x27;Belgravia&#x27;, &#x27;Knightsbridge&#x27; and &#x27;Knightsbridge Green&#x27;. Properties must be offered here by developers as refurbished flats or houses meeting the enhanced architectural demands in the local Conservation Areas policy of the Local Plan. Within each many buildings are covered by the similar but separate requirements of being listed. Growing demand has since 2000 persuaded the authority to revise its planning policies to permit roof terraces and basement extensions, for residential facilities from leisure suites to private nightclubs, a degree of economic liberalisation documented by a non-tabloid paper in 2008.

The underlying landowners of the few streets making up, without any dispute, Knightsbridge are the Duke of Westminster, Lord Cadogan and the Wellcome Trust with a minority of the freeholds to houses in each street sold to others. Red-brick Queen Anne revival buildings form most of the Cadogan Estates, whereas white stucco-fronted houses are mostly found on the Grosvenor Estate, designed by architect Thomas Cubitt.

The Brompton Oratory, a place of Catholic worship, marks one of the transitions into Kensington, but Belgravia and Brompton have competing mapped neighbourhood status in the east and south of the neighbourhood, and as they have no eponymously named tube stations or historic parish boundaries, their limits are arbitrary and the triangular salient of Brompton, administratively in Kensington, as part of South Kensington, once coloured mid-wealth by Charles Booth, is now blurred with &#x27;Knightsbridge&#x27;, into which it long projected.

Brompton is only used when the postcode and/or Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is being emphasised, rather than the modern Central London &#x27;district&#x27; definitions, which suggest Knightsbridge or South Kensington, either tube station, being at most 350 m away and thus can be easily found on all maps.

== Crime ==
For centuries, the area was renowned as the haunt of highwaymen, robbers and cutthroats targeting travellers on the western route out of London, but its fortunes were transformed in the 19th century. However, the area has been a target of several high-profile crimes.

In September and October 1975, the Spaghetti House siege happened.

In November 1975, two civilians were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the Walton&#x27;s Restaurant bombing.

In 1980, the Iranian Embassy siege took place, lasting several days. It ended when the Special Air Service stormed the building, which was on live television.

In 1983, three Christmas shoppers and three Metropolitan Police officers were killed by an IRA car bomb outside Harrods.

In 1987, the Knightsbridge Security Deposit centre was the target of a robbery worth £60 million.

In 2005, 22-year-old beautician Clare Bernal was gunned down by her ex-boyfriend Michal Pech on the shopfloor of Harvey Nichols in front of colleagues and shoppers before Pech fatally turned the gun on himself. The case attracted extensive coverage in the media, and Clare&#x27;s mother Patricia has since led a campaign to address flaws in the system, which allowed her daughter&#x27;s murder to happen.

Many residential buildings are heavily covered by CCTV and are staffed by security guards, and railings or bars on lower floor windows are commonplace.

== Buildings ==

To the north of the area, is the Hyde Park Barracks of the Household Cavalry, with a distinctive 33-storey tower by Sir Basil Spence. The Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Department is based in Walton Street. The Embassy of Libya is located at 15 Knightsbridge, the Embassy of France at no 58 and the Embassy of Kuwait at 2 Albert Gate, just off Knightsbridge.

On the religious side it contains the impressive Brompton Oratory (Catholic church, Brompton Road) and the CoE Holy Trinity Church behind it, a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Exhibition Road, the Russian Orthodox Church in Ennismore Gardens, St Columba&#x27;s Church of Scotland, Pont Street, and Deutsche Evangelische Christuskirche. The former St Saviour&#x27;s church, designed by George Basevi, is now a private home.

Notably, two of the four London buildings of Hill House School are located here at Cadogan Gardens and Hans Place.

== Transport ==

Knightsbridge takes its name from the road that runs along the south side of Hyde Park, west from Hyde Park Corner, spanning the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Up to Brompton Road, it is a part of the A4 arterial road, while the remainder is part of the A315 road. West of Rutland Gardens, the road becomes Kensington Road.

It is served by Knightsbridge station on the Piccadilly line, and Sloane Square station on the District and Circle lines. Brompton Road station closed in 1934.

==In popular culture==
Eric Coates uses Knightsbridge as the setting of a march for the 3rd movement of his &quot;London Suite&quot; (1933). It gained popularity through the radio show &quot;In Town Tonight&quot; (1933–1960).

Knightsbridge is referenced in the Rolling Stones song &quot;Play with Fire&quot;, released in 1965. Knightsbridge is used as an indicator of a character&#x27;s affluence, as opposed to the more working class Stepney.

According to season 3 episode &#x27;Happy New Year,&#x27; Knightsbridge is the setting of the television series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous.&quot; St. Columba&#x27;s Church in Knightsbridge is the setting of a wedding in the 1996 episode &#x27;The Last Shout.&#x27;

Knightsbridge is referenced in the story book &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman as a place the protagonists need to cross to go to the next floating market. &quot;The Knightsbridge&quot; is used as metaphor for the night and its dangers they need to pass through.

In the 2017 film &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, Knightsbridge is the location of a detonated bomb that sets the plot in motion.

On his 2017 mixtape &quot;Working on Dying&quot; Swedish rapper Bladee references Knightsbridge in the title and lyrics of a song.

Bars, clubs and restaurants of Knightsbridge frequently feature in the Channel4&#x27;s reality tv show Made in Chelsea.

<text>A songwriter is a person who creates musical compositions or writes lyrics for songs, or both. The writer of the music for a song can be called a composer, although this term tends to be used mainly in the classical music genre and film scoring. A songwriter who mainly writes the lyrics for a song is referred to as a lyricist. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that song writing is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed among a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be composed by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have external publishers.

The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by university degrees, college diplomas and &quot;rock schools&quot;. Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are significant for modern songwriters. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules. Since songwriting and publishing royalties can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a hit record; legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international copyright law.

Songwriters can be employed in a variety of different ways. They may exclusively write lyrics or compose music alongside another artist, present songs to A&amp;R, publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriter&#x27;s behalf by their publisher or independently using tip sheets like &quot;RowFax&quot;, the &quot;MusicRow&quot; publication and &quot;SongQuarters&quot;. Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity. Staff writers do not necessarily get printed credit for their contributions to the song.

== Staff writers ==

Songwriters who sign an exclusive songwriting agreement with a publisher are called &quot;staff writers&quot;. Being a staff writer effectively means that, during the term of the songwriter&#x27;s contract with the publisher, all their songs are automatically published by that company and cannot be published elsewhere.

In the Nashville country music scene, there is a strong staff writer culture where contracted writers work normal &quot;9-to-5&quot; hours at the publishing office and are paid a regular salary, says staff writer Gary Growden. This salary is in effect the writer&#x27;s &quot;draw&quot;, an advance on future earnings, which is paid monthly and enables them to live within a fixed budget. The publisher owns the copyright of songs written during the term of the agreement for a designated period, after which the songwriter can reclaim the copyright. In an interview with HitQuarters, songwriter Dave Berg extolled the benefits of the set-up: &quot;I was able to concentrate on writing the whole time and have always had enough money to live on.&quot;

Unlike contracted writers, some staff writers operate as employees for their respective publishers. Under the terms of these
work for hire agreements, the compositions created are fully owned by the publisher. Because the recapture provision of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 does not apply to &quot;works made for hire&quot;, the rights to a song created under an employment contract cannot be &quot;recaptured&quot; by the writer after 35 years. In Nashville, young writers are often strongly encouraged to avoid these types of contracts.

Staff writers are common across the whole industry, but without the more office-like working arrangements favoured in Nashville. All the major publishers employ writers under contract. Obtaining a staff writer contract with a publisher can be the first step for any professional songwriting career, with some writers with a desire for greater independence outgrowing this set-up once they achieve a degree of success. Songwriter Allan Eshuijs described his staff writer contract at Universal Music Publishing as a starter deal. His success under the arrangement eventually allowed him to found his own publishing company so that he could &quot;keep as much [publishing income] as possible and say how it&#x27;s going to be done.&quot;

== Specific roles ==

=== Beatmaker ===

A beatmaker is a songwriter who creates and composes music or beats for a song, often laying the groundwork or &quot;musical bed&quot;. Tools typically used are synthesizers, drum machines, and digital audio workstations. Beat makers or composers are not necessarily record producers by definition since they generally do not work directly with artists in a recording studio that oversees the production and recording of the final product.

However, record producers can be involved in co-writing songs as the composer wearing two hats as the producer and songwriter as they may write and compose the original music such as the beat and then oversee the production that takes control of the recording sessions with the artist and engineer all the way down to the mix stage. They are referred to as Record Producer / Songwriters as they generally receive songwriting and production credits for both roles. This is especially true for R&amp;B, hip-hop producers in urban hip hop production, when composing the original music as the co-writer is integrated into their traditional role as a Record Producer, such as Rodney Jerkins, Dr. Dre, Timbaland or Pharrell Williams, as opposed to a rock producer that may rarely contribute as a co-writer of a song.

=== Top-liners ===

A top-line writer or top-liner is a songwriter who writes a song over a pre-made beat. In top-lining, the writer is not creating a song from scratch, but rather creating lyrics and melodies over an existing music genre, tonality, harmony, rhythm, and form of a song.

In modern commercial writing, it is a common practice for the musical track to be produced first without any vocal melody or lyrics. This is partially due to the rise of portable music production equipment and digital audio workstations that are designed for the swift arrangement of electronic music, such as Cubase and Ableton Live.

The top-liner usually is also a singer, and will sing over the track as the demo singer. If the song is for a particular artist, the top-liner may sing the demo in that artist&#x27;s style. Top-liners often work in groups to co-write. Sometimes producers send out tracks to more than one top-line writer so that the producer or singer could choose the best option. Since the track is the same, melodies by different writers can sometimes be very similar. Occasionally, the producer might choose a few lines of melodic or lyrical ideas from one top-liner without properly crediting or paying them. These situations sometimes result in legal battles over ownership of the melodies or lyrics.

There is a way to prevent such legal battles. A songwriter can commit their &quot;intent to make a song&quot;, which prevents any of the parties ripping the song apart. Some artists send out a legal disclaimer making clear that if their melody is not used after doing a topline, it reverts to them, and the track back to the track writer.

== Multi-tasking songwriters ==

=== As instrumentalists===

Songwriters are also often skilled musical instrument players. In part, this is because the process of &quot;working out&quot; a song or arrangement requires a songwriter to play an instrument, typically the guitar or the piano, to hear how the chord progression sounds and to hear how well a given set of chords supports a melody. In addition to selling their songs and musical concepts for other artists to sing, some songwriter-musicians create songs to perform themselves. Songwriters need to create a number of elements for a song, including an introduction, various verses and a chorus. At minimum, a songwriter must prepare a lead sheet for a song, which consists of one or more pieces of sheet music with the melody notes and chord progression indicated on it.

The songwriter may expand upon the melody and chord progression by adding an instrumental melody (which may occur before or after the vocal melody, or alongside the vocal melody) and creating a more complex song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental solo section, etc.).

=== As producers ===

With recent technological improvements, a songwriter can now create commercially viable music almost entirely on their laptop. This technological advancement has made the producer/songwriter role a much more popular occurrence. Perhaps because the role of producer is not generally understood by the public, the average listener does not know when an artist also takes on the role of producer.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys is one of the earliest and most widely known examples of a songwriter turned music producer. Within two years of the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, Wilson had taken over from his father Murry, and he was the sole producer of all their recordings between 1963 and 1967.

=== As singers ===
Many singers also write songs for themselves, and as such, they are usually referred to as singer-songwriters.

== Sole writing ==

In solitary songwriting or sole writing, only one person is responsible in creating the entire music and lyrics of a song. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, 44% of the songs that reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart during the 1970s were written by just one songwriter. The percentage declined to 42% in the 1980s, 24% in the 1990s, 6% in the 2000s, and 4% in the 2010s.

Lionel Richie and Diane Warren are the only songwriters with at least 8 number-one singles written solely by themselves. A very few artists solely wrote, produced, and performed a Hot 100 number-one song such as Prince (&quot;When Doves Cry&quot;), Debbie Gibson (&quot;Foolish Beat&quot; and &quot;Lost in Your Eyes&quot;), Lauryn Hill (&quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;), Alicia Keys (&quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot;), and Pharrell Williams (&quot;Happy&quot;).

== Co-writing ==
Songs can be written jointly or written in collaboration with other songwriters. Co-writers may use the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; approach, referring to having ideas flow rather than being discussed. The first step in co-writing is to establish the division of the contribution between co-writers. In copyright law, there is no distinction of importance between the lyrics of the song or the melody of the song, therefore each writer is given equal ownership over the song, unless another agreement is arranged. &quot;Phantom&quot; songwriters provide small contributions to songs. The songwriter suggests a line for a verse or a session musician who informally proposes a chord progression for a coda. &quot;Phantom&quot; songwriters are usually not given credit.

=== Songwriting partnership ===

Songwriting partnership or songwriting duo is a prolific collaboration which consists of two songwriters, usually sharing 50% royalty each. Songwriting partnership can be between a composer and a lyricist (Andrew Lloyd Webber with Tim Rice, or Elton John with Bernie Taupin), a performer and a producer (Madonna with Patrick Leonard or Mariah Carey with Walter Afanasieff), or between bandmates (Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones or Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA).

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the songwriting partnership between John Lennon and Paul McCartney remains the most successful one of all time, resulting over 180 songs and a record 20 number ones for the Beatles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Songwriting partnership between siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas O&#x27;Connell have generated multiple wins at the Academy Awards for Best Original Song as well as the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

=== Songwriting camp ===
Songwriting camp is a gathering of multiple producers and topliners in a pre-selected location for the purpose of writing songs for a specific artist. As one of the most successful artists in releasing many hit songs, Rihanna has been known for holding various writing camps to make her albums. Writing camps are also very popular in the K-pop music industry.

===Sampling===

Sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. The original songwriter(s) of a song usually receive co-writing credit when their work is sampled on another song, although they did not literally involve in making the latter. For example, Sting is credited as a co-writer alongside Todd Gaither and Faith Evans for &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; (1997) due to the sample of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (1983), a song he solely wrote for the Police. However, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; did not have legal approval for the sample before its release, thus Sting sued and received 100% of the song royalties, with payments reportedly going until 2053. Beyoncé&#x27;s album &quot;Lemonade&quot; (2016) features as many as 72 co-writers due to use of samples in majority of its tracks.

<doc id="94155" wikidata="Q376608" url="?curid=94155" title="Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology">
<text>Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology is the sacred spirituality represented in the stories performed by Aboriginal Australians within each of the language groups across Australia in their ceremonies. Aboriginal spirituality includes the Dreamtime (&quot;the Dreaming&quot;), songlines, and Aboriginal oral literature.

Aboriginal spirituality often conveys descriptions of each group&#x27;s local cultural landscape, adding meaning to the whole country&#x27;s topography from oral history told by ancestors from some of the earliest recorded history. Most of these spiritualities belong to specific groups, but some span the whole continent in one form or another.

==Antiquity==
An Australian linguist, R. M. W. Dixon, recording Aboriginal myths in their original languages, encountered coincidences between some of the landscape details being told about within various myths, and scientific discoveries being made about the same landscapes. In the case of the Atherton Tableland, myths tell of the origins of Lake Eacham, Lake Barrine, and Lake Euramoo. Geological research dated the formative volcanic explosions described by Aboriginal myth tellers as having occurred more than 10,000 years ago. Pollen fossil sampling from the silt which had settled to the bottom of the craters confirmed the Aboriginal myth-tellers&#x27; story. When the craters were formed, eucalyptus forests dominated rather than the current wet tropical rainforests.

Dixon observed from the evidence available that Aboriginal myths regarding the origin of the Crater Lakes might be dated as accurate back to 10,000 years ago. Further investigation of the material by the Australian Heritage Commission led to the Crater Lakes myth being listed nationally on the Register of the National Estate, and included within Australia&#x27;s World Heritage nomination of the wet tropical forests, as an &quot;unparalleled human record of events dating back to the Pleistocene era.&quot;

Since then, Dixon has assembled a number of similar examples of Australian Aboriginal myths that accurately describe landscapes of an ancient past. He particularly noted the numerous myths telling of previous sea levels, including:

* the Port Phillip myth (recorded as told to Robert Russell in 1850), describing Port Phillip Bay as once dry land, and the course of the Yarra River being once different, following what was then Carrum Carrum swamp.
* the Great Barrier Reef coastline myth (told to Dixon) in Yarrabah, just south of Cairns, telling of a past coastline (since flooded) which stood at the edge of the current Great Barrier Reef, and naming places now completely submerged after the forest types and trees that once grew there.
* the Lake Eyre myths (recorded by J. W. Gregory in 1906), telling of the deserts of Central Australia as once having been fertile, well-watered plains, and the deserts around present Lake Eyre having been one continuous garden. This oral story matches geologists&#x27; understanding that there was a wet phase to the early Holocene when the lake would have had permanent water.

Other volcanic eruptions in Australia may also be recorded in Aboriginal myths, including Mount Gambier in South Australia, and Kinrara in northern Queensland.

==Aboriginal mythology: whole of Australia==
The stories enshrined in Aboriginal mythology variously &quot;tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group&#x27;s local landscape. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent&#x27;s topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to time immemorial&quot;.

David Horton&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia&quot; contains an article on Aboriginal mythology observing: A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else.

Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories.
Australian Aboriginal mythologies have been characterised as &quot;at one and the same time fragments of a catechism, a liturgical manual, a history of civilization, a geography textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of cosmography.&quot;

===Diversity across a continent===
There are 900 distinct Aboriginal groups across Australia,
each distinguished by unique names usually identifying particular languages, dialects, or distinctive speech mannerisms. Each language was used for original myths, from which the distinctive words and names of individual myths derive.

With so many distinct Aboriginal groups, languages, beliefs and practices, scholars cannot attempt to characterise, under a single heading, the full range and diversity of all myths being variously and continuously told, developed, elaborated, performed, and experienced by group members across the entire continent. Attempts to represent the different groupings in maps have varied widely.

&quot;The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia&quot; nevertheless observes: &quot;One intriguing feature [of Aboriginal Australian mythology] is the mixture of diversity and similarity in myths across the entire continent.&quot;

===Public education about Aboriginal perspectives===
The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation&#x27;s booklet, &quot;Understanding Country&quot;, formally seeks to introduce non-Indigenous Australians to Aboriginal perspectives on the environment. It makes the following generalisation about Aboriginal myths and mythology: ...they generally describe the journeys of ancestral beings, often giant animals or people, over what began as a featureless domain. Mountains, rivers, waterholes, animal and plant species, and other natural and cultural resources came into being as a result of events which took place during these Dreamtime journeys. Their existence in present-day landscapes is seen by many Indigenous peoples as confirmation of their creation beliefs...&lt;br&gt;
The routes taken by the Creator Beings in their Dreamtime journeys across land and sea... link many sacred sites together in a web of Dreamtime tracks criss-crossing the country. Dreaming tracks can run for hundreds, even thousands of kilometres, from desert to the coast [and] may be shared by peoples in countries through which the tracks pass...

===An anthropological generalisation===

Australian anthropologists willing to generalise suggest Aboriginal myths still being performed across Australia by Aboriginal peoples serve an important social function amongst their intended audiences: justifying the received ordering of their daily lives; helping shape peoples&#x27; ideas; and assisting to influence others&#x27; behaviour. In addition, such performance often continuously incorporates and &quot;mythologises&quot; historical events in the service of these social purposes in an otherwise rapidly changing modern world.
It is always integral and common... that the Law (Aboriginal law) is something derived from ancestral peoples or Dreamings and is passed down the generations in a continuous line. While... entitlements of particular human beings may come and go, the underlying relationships between foundational Dreamings and certain landscapes are theoretically eternal ... the entitlements of people to places are usually regarded strongest when those people enjoy a relationship of identity with one or more Dreamings of that place. This is an identity of spirit, a consubstantiality, rather than a matter of mere belief...: the Dreaming pre-exists and persists, while its human incarnations are temporary.

===An Aboriginal generalisation===

Aboriginal specialists willing to generalise believe all Aboriginal myths across Australia, in combination, represent a kind of unwritten (oral) library within which Aboriginal peoples learn about the world and perceive a peculiarly Aboriginal &#x27;reality&#x27; dictated by concepts and values vastly different from those of western societies:
===Sacred sites===

Aboriginal people observe some places as sacred, owing to their central place in the mythology of the local people.

==Pan-Australian mythology==
===Rainbow Serpent===
In 1926 a British anthropologist specialising in Australian Aboriginal ethnology and ethnography, Professor Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, noted many Aboriginal groups widely distributed across the Australian continent all appeared to share variations of a single (common) myth telling of an unusually powerful, often creative, often dangerous snake or serpent of sometimes enormous size closely associated with the rainbows, rain, rivers, and deep waterholes.

Radcliffe-Brown coined the term &#x27;Rainbow Serpent&#x27; to describe what he identified to be a common, recurring myth. Working in the field in various places on the Australian continent, he noted the key character of this myth (the &#x27;Rainbow Serpent&#x27;) is variously named: &quot;Kanmare&quot; (Boulia, Queensland); &quot;Tulloun&quot;: (Mount Isa); &quot;Andrenjinyi&quot; (Pennefather River, Queensland), &quot;Takkan&quot; (Maryborough, Queensland); &quot;Targan&quot; (Brisbane, Queensland); &quot;Kurreah&quot; (Broken Hill, New South Wales);&quot;Wawi&quot; (Riverina, New South Wales), &quot;Neitee &amp; Yeutta&quot; (Wilcannia, New South Wales), &quot;Myndie&quot; (Melbourne, Victoria); &quot;Bunyip&quot; (Western Victoria); &quot;Arkaroo&quot; (Flinders Ranges, South Australia); &quot;Wogal&quot; (Perth, Western Australia); &quot;Wanamangura&quot; (Laverton, Western Australia); &quot;Kajura&quot; (Carnarvon, Western Australia); &quot;Numereji&quot; (Kakadu, Northern Territory).

This &#x27;Rainbow Serpent&#x27; is generally and variously identified by those who tell &#x27;Rainbow Serpent&#x27; myths, as a snake of some enormous size often living within the deepest waterholes of many of Australia&#x27;s waterways; descended from that larger being visible as a dark streak in the Milky Way, it reveals itself to people in this world as a rainbow as it moves through water and rain, shaping landscapes, naming and singing of places, swallowing and sometimes drowning people; strengthening the knowledgeable with rainmaking and healing powers; blighting others with sores, weakness, illness, and death.

Even Australia&#x27;s &#x27;Bunyip&#x27; was identified as a &#x27;Rainbow Serpent&#x27; myth of the above kind. The term coined by Radcliffe-Brown is now commonly used and familiar to broader Australian and international audiences, as it is increasingly used by government agencies, museums, art galleries, Aboriginal organisations and the media to refer to the pan-Australian Aboriginal myth specifically, and as a shorthand allusion to Australian Aboriginal mythology generally.

===Captain Cook===
A number of linguists, anthropologists and others have formally documented another common Aboriginal myth occurring across Australia. Predecessors of the myth tellers encounter a mythical, exotic (most often English) character who arrives from the sea, bringing western colonialism, either offering gifts to the performer&#x27;s predecessors or bringing great harm upon the performer&#x27;s predecessors.

This key mythical character is most often named &quot;Captain Cook&quot;, this being a mythical character shared with the broader Australian community, who also attribute James Cook with playing a key role in colonising Australia. The Aboriginal Captain Cook is attributed with bringing British rule to Australia, but his arrival is not celebrated. More often within the Aboriginal telling, he proves to be a villain.

The many Aboriginal versions of this Captain Cook are rarely oral recollections of encounters with the Lieutenant James Cook who first navigated and mapped Australia&#x27;s east coast on HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1770. Guugu Yimidhirr predecessors, along the Endeavour River, did encounter James Cook during a 7-week period beached at the site of the present town of Cooktown while the &quot;Endeavour&quot; was being repaired. From this time the Guugu Yimidhirr did receive present-day names for places occurring in their local landscape; and the Guugu Yimmidhir recollect this encounter.

The pan-Australian Captain Cook myth, however, tells of a generic, largely symbolic British character who arrives from across the oceans sometime after the Aboriginal world was formed and the original social order founded. This Captain Cook is a harbinger of dramatic transformations in the social order, bringing change and a different social order, into which present-day audiences have been born. (see above regarding this social function played by Aboriginal myths)

In 1988 Australian anthropologist Kenneth Maddock assembled several versions of this Captain Cook myth as recorded from a number of Aboriginal groups around Australia. Included in his assemblage are:
* Batemans Bay, New South Wales: Percy Mumbulla told of Captain Cook&#x27;s arriving on a large ship which anchored at Snapper Island, from which he disembarked to give the myth-teller&#x27;s predecessors clothes (to wear) and hard biscuits (to eat). Then he returned to his ship and sailed away. Mumbulla told how his predecessors rejected Captain Cook&#x27;s gifts, throwing them into the sea.
* Cardwell, Queensland: Chloe Grant and Rosie Runaway told of how Captain Cook and his group seemed to stand up out of the sea with the white skin of ancestral spirits, returning to their descendants. Captain Cook arrived first offering a pipe and tobacco to smoke (which was dismissed as a &#x27;burning thing... stuck in his mouth&#x27;), then boiling a billy of tea (which was dismissed as scalding &#x27;dirty water&#x27;), next baking flour on the coals (which was rejected as smelling &#x27;stale&#x27; and thrown away untasted), finally boiling beef (which smelled well, and tasted okay, once the salty skin was wiped off). Captain Cook and group then left, sailing away to the north, leaving Chloe Grant and Rosie Runaway&#x27;s predecessors beating the ground with their fists, fearfully sorry to see the spirits of their ancestors depart in this way.
* South-eastern side of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland: Rolly Gilbert told of how Captain Cook and others sailed the oceans in a boat, and decided to come to see Australia. There he encountered a couple of Rolly&#x27;s predecessors whom he first intended to shoot, but instead tricked them into revealing the local population&#x27;s main camping area, after which they:

set up the people [cattle industry] to go down the countryside and shoot people down, just like animal, they left them lying there for the hawks and crows... So a lot of old people and young people were struck by the head with the end of a gun and left there. They wanted to get the people wiped out because Europeans in Queensland had to run their stock: horses and cattle.
* Victoria River: it is told in a Captain Cook saga that Captain Cook sailed from London to Sydney to acquire land. Admiring the country, he landed bullocks and men with firearms, following which local Aboriginal peoples in the Sydney area were massacred. Captain Cook made his way to Darwin, where he sent armed horsemen to hunt down the Aboriginal people in the Victoria River country, founding the city of Darwin and giving police plus cattle station managers orders on how to treat Aboriginal people.
* Kimberley: Numerous Aboriginal myth-tellers say that Captain Cook is a European culture hero who landed in Australia. Using gunpowder, he set a precedent for the treatment of Aboriginal peoples throughout Australia, including the Kimberley. On returning to his home, he claimed he had not seen any Aboriginal peoples, and advised that the country was a vast and empty land which settlers could come and claim for themselves. In this myth, Captain Cook introduced &#x27;Cook&#x27;s Law&#x27;, upon which the settlers rely. The Aboriginal people note, however, that this is a recent, unjust and false law compared to Aboriginal law.

=== Views on death ===

The response to death in Aboriginal religion may seem similar in some respects to that to be found in European traditions - notably in regard to the holding of a ceremony to mark the death of an individual and the observance of a period of mourning for that individual. Any such similarity, however, is, at best, only superficial (with ceremony and mourning of some kind being common to most, if not all, human cultures). In death - as in life - Aboriginal spirituality gives pre-eminence to the land and sees the deceased as linked indissolubly, by a web of subtle connections, to that greater whole: &quot;For Aboriginal people when a person dies some form of the persons spirit and also their bones go back to the country they were born in&quot;. &quot;Aborigine people [sic] believe that they share their being with their country and all that is within it&quot;. &quot;So when a person dies their country suffers, trees die and become scarred because it is believed that they came into being because of the deceased person&quot;.

When an Aboriginal person dies the families have death ceremonies called the &quot;Sorry Business&quot;. During this time the person is mourned for days by the family and whole community, crying together and sharing their grief. Often the deceased person&#x27;s family stay in one room and mourn together.

Naming a person after their death is often taboo, as it is thought that it could disturb their spirit. Photos of the deceased are often not allowed, for the same reason. A smoking ceremony may be conducted, using smoke on the belongings and in the home of the deceased, which is believed to aid in releasing the spirit. The cause of death, often of a spiritual nature, may be determined by Aboriginal elders.

Ceremonies and mourning periods can last days, weeks and even sometimes months depending upon the social status of the deceased person. It is culturally inappropriate for a non-Aboriginal person to contact and inform the next of kin of a person&#x27;s passing. When someone passes away, the family of the deceased move out of their house and another family then moves in. Some families will move to &quot;sorry camps&quot;, which are usually further away. Mourning includes the recital of symbolic chants, the singing of songs, dance, body paint, and cuts on the bodies of the mourners. In some Aboriginal cultures, the body is placed on a raised platform for several months, covered in native plants, or in a cave or tree. When only the bones remain, family and friends scatter them in various ways, or place them in a special place.

Many Aboriginal people believe in a place called the &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. This place was also commonly known as the &quot;sky-world&quot;, which is really just the sky. As long as certain rituals were carried out during their life and at the time of their death, the deceased is allowed to enter The Land of the Dead in the &quot;Sky World&quot;. The spirit of the dead is also a part of different lands and sites and then those areas become sacred sites. This explains why the Aboriginal people are very protective of sites they call sacred.

The rituals that are performed enable an Aboriginal person to return to the womb of all time, which is &quot;Dreamtime&quot;. It allows the spirit to be connected once more to all nature, to all their ancestors, and to their own personal meaning and place within the scheme of things. &quot;The Dreamtime is a return to the real existence for the aborigine&quot;. &quot;Life in time is simply a passing phase – a gap in eternity&quot;. It has a beginning and it has an end. &quot;The experience of Dreamtime, whether through ritual or from dreams, flowed through into the life in time in practical ways&quot;. &quot;The individual who enters the Dreamtime feels no separation between themselves and their ancestors&quot;. &quot;The strengths and resources of the timeless enter into what is needed in the life of the present&quot;. &quot;The future is less uncertain because the individual feels their life as a continuum linking past and future in unbroken connection&quot;. Through Dreamtime the limitations of time and space are overcome. For the Aboriginal people, dead relatives are very much a part of continuing life. It is believed that in dreams dead relatives communicate their presence.&quot; At times they may bring healing if the dreamer is in pain&quot;. &quot;Death is seen as part of a cycle of life in which one emerges from Dreamtime through birth, and eventually returns to the timeless, only to emerge again. It is also a common belief that a person leaves their body during sleep, and temporarily enters the Dreamtime&quot;.

===Link to astronomy===

There are many songlines which include reference to the stars, planets and the Moon, although the complex systems which go to make up Australian Aboriginal astronomy also serve practical purposes, such as navigation.

==Group-specific mythology==
===Yolngu===
===Murrinh-Patha people===

The Murrinh-Patha people (whose country is the saltwater country immediately inland from the town of Wadeye) describe a Dreamtime in their myths which anthropologists believe is a religious belief equivalent to, though wholly different from, most of the world&#x27;s other significant religious beliefs.

In particular, scholars suggest the Murrinh-Patha have a oneness of thought, belief, and expression unequalled within Christianity, as they see all aspects of their lives, thoughts and culture as under the continuing influence of their Dreaming. Within this Aboriginal religion, no distinction is drawn between things spiritual/ideal/mental and things material; nor is any distinction drawn between things sacred and things profane: rather all life is &#x27;sacred&#x27;, all conduct has &#x27;moral&#x27; implication, and all life&#x27;s meaning arises out of this eternal, everpresent Dreaming.
In fact, the isomorphic fit between the natural and supernatural means that all nature is coded and charged by the sacred, while the sacred is everywhere within the physical landscape. Myths and mythic tracks cross over.. thousands of miles, and every particular form and feature of the terrain has a well-developed &#x27;story&#x27; behind it.

Animating and sustaining this Murrinh-patha mythology is an underlying philosophy of life that has been characterised by Stanner as a belief that life is &quot;... a joyous thing with maggots at its centre.&quot; Life is good and benevolent, but throughout life&#x27;s journey, there are numerous painful sufferings that each individual must come to understand and endure as he grows. This is the underlying message repeatedly being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people motive and meaning in life.

The following Murrinh-patha myth, for instance, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood.
&quot;A woman, &quot;Mutjinga&quot; (the &#x27;Old Woman&#x27;), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents&#x27; absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body.&quot;
Within the myth and in its performance, young, unadorned children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being (who transforms into a giant snake), then regurgitated before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and privileges of young adults.

===Pintupi people===

Scholars of the Pintupi peoples (from within Australia&#x27;s Gibson Desert region) believe they have a predominantly &#x27;mythic&#x27; form of consciousness, within which events occur and are explained by the preordained social structures and orders told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology, rather than by reference to the possible accumulated political actions, decisions and influences of local individuals (i.e. this understanding effectively &#x27;erases&#x27; history). The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied.

These human creations are objectified – thrust out – into principles or precedents for the immediate world.. Consequently, current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order.

Within this Pintupi world view, three long geographical tracks of named places dominate, being interrelated strings of significant places named and created by mythic characters on their routes through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of narratives, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as &quot;Tingarri&quot;. It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country.

==Newer belief systems==
In principle, census information could identify the extent of traditional Aboriginal beliefs compared to other belief systems such as Christianity; however the official census in Australia does not include traditional Aboriginal beliefs as a religion, and includes Torres Strait Islanders, a separate group of Indigenous Australians, in most of the counts.

In the 1991 census, almost 74 percent of Aboriginal respondents identified with Christianity, up from 67 percent in the 1986 census. The wording of the question changed for the 1991 census; as the religion question is optional, the number of respondents reduced. The 1996 census reported that almost 72 percent of Aboriginal people practised some form of Christianity, and that 16 percent listed no religion. The 2001 census contained no comparable updated data.

The Aboriginal population also includes a small number of followers of other mainstream religions.

<doc id="94157" wikidata="Q2750829" url="?curid=94157" title="Leyton">
<text>Leyton ( ) is a town in East London, England, within the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It borders Walthamstow to the north, Leytonstone to the east, and Stratford to the south, with Clapton, Hackney Wick and Homerton, across the River Lea, to the west. The area includes New Spitalfields Market, Leyton Orient Football Club, as well as part of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The town consists largely of terraced houses built between 1870 and 1910, interspersed with some modern housing estates. It is north-east of Charing Cross.
It was historically part of the ancient parish of Leyton St Mary in the Becontree hundred and part of the ancient county of Essex. The town expanded rapidly in the late 19th century, forming part of the conurbation of London and becoming a suburb, similar to much of south-west Essex. It became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1839 and has been part of the London postal district since its inception in 1856. The parish became an urban district in 1894 and gained municipal borough status in 1926. In 1965, it merged with the neighbouring municipal boroughs of Walthamstow and Chingford to form the London Borough of Waltham Forest, a local government district of Greater London.

The town has become one of the most ethnically diverse areas in England, with 69 per cent of residents belonging to a non-British ethnic background. Once a traditional, working class area, it is undergoing large-scale regeneration and gentrification, with large numbers of young professionals moving into the area.

==History==
 Paleolithic implements and fossil bones show that early man hunted in Leyton. A Roman cemetery and the foundations of a Roman villa have been found here. From Anglo-Saxon times, Leyton has been part of the County of Essex. The name means &quot;settlement (&quot;tun&quot;) on the River Lea&quot; and was also known until 1921 as &quot;Low Leyton&quot;. In the Domesday Book, the name is rendered as &quot;Leintun&quot;. at which time the population was 43.

The ancient parish church of St Mary the Virgin was largely rebuilt in the 17th century. The parish of Leyton also included Leytonstone. The old civil parish was formed into an Urban District within Essex in 1894 and it gained the status of Municipal Borough in 1926. The parish and urban district were officially known as Low Leyton until 1921. In 1965, the Municipal Borough of Leyton was abolished and was combined with that of Walthamstow and Chingford to form the London Borough of Waltham Forest, within the new county of Greater London. Although Leyton did not become officially part of London until 1965, the borough formed part of London&#x27;s built-up area and had been part of the London postal district since its inception in 1856 and the Metropolitan Police District since 1839.

The main route through the town is the High Road, which forms part of the ancient route to Waltham Abbey. At the top end of the High Road is a crossroads with Lea Bridge Road and Hoe Street. This junction and the surrounding district is known as Bakers Arms, named after the public house which has now closed down. The pub was named in honour of the almshouses on Lea Bridge Road built in 1857 by the London Master Bakers&#x27; Benevolent Institution.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Leyton was a &quot;pretty retiring place from London&quot; for wealthy merchants and bankers; in 1766 there were said to be 50 or 60 gentlemen with houses in the parish. Leyton&#x27;s development from an agricultural community to an industrial and residential suburb was given impetus by the arrival of the railway. First at Lea Bridge Station in 1840, then at Low Leyton in 1856 (now Leyton Underground). Finally Leyton Midland Road opened in 1894, after an elevated line had been built on brick arches across the already developed streets. However, not all the green spaces were lost, of Epping Forest within Leyton&#x27;s borders were preserved by the Epping Forest Act 1878. In 1897 Leyton Urban District Council purchased the land for a formal park close to the town hall; it opened in 1903 as Coronation Gardens, named after the coronation of King Edward VII. In 1905, the &quot;Lammas land&quot;, common pasture land on Leyton Marshes, was purchased by the council for use as a recreation ground.

In World War I, about 1,300 houses were damaged by Zeppelin raids. By the 1920s, it had become a built-up and thriving urban industrial area known for manufacturing neckties and for its Thermos factory. During the Blitz of World War II, Leyton suffered as a target because of its proximity to the London Docks and Temple Mills rail yard. The yard (named after an ancient mill owned by the Knights Templar) is now reduced in size as part of it has become a retail park &#x27;Leyton Mills&#x27;, whilst the rest has been renovated to serve as a depot for high-speed Eurostar trains.

After World War Two, Leyton suffered from large-scale industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century. But, like much of east London, Leyton, which also borders the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, has benefited from significant regeneration projects over the past decade. Parks have been spruced up, some new small parks and gardens created and several tower blocks have been demolished. The millennium was marked with a clock tower in the Lea Bridge Rd area and a major piece of street art at Baker&#x27;s Arms. And, most recently, in the build-up to the Olympics, Waltham Forest Borough Council spent £475,000 restoring 41 shopfronts on the part of Leyton High Road closest to the 2012 London Olympic Games site. The Olympics authority also funded the smartening up of pavements and street furniture.

==Geography==
Leyton is in the Lower Lea Valley, the river forming its western boundary. The area rises from low-lying marshland along the river Lea to over 90 feet at Whipps Cross on the southern edge of Epping Forest. Leyton is partially bisected by the A12 (M11 link road, built in the 1990s), with most of the district lying on the north-west side of this busy traffic artery through east London.

The High Road Leyton bridge crossing the A12 offers some of the best views in London of the Olympic Park, which also borders the district, as well as of skyscrapers further west. It borders Walthamstow along Lea Bridge Road and areas of the London Borough of Hackney via the River Lea.

==Demography==

Leyton, which comprises three electoral wards with a total population of 42,061, is a diverse district. Between 61 and 69 per cent of its residents are either Black, Asian, or from an ethnic minority, according to the London Borough of Waltham Forest profile reports for the Leyton (ward), Grove Green and Lea Bridge (ward) wards. This compares to 55.1% in the Borough as a whole, according to the 2011 United Kingdom census. Within these groups, there are many people whose origins are from Russia, North Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Jamaica, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus, and Italy as well as newer arrivals from South Africa, Bosnia, Serbia, and Poland. Moreover, more than half the population is under the age of 30, according to the most recent census. It is also highly multi-cultural, with just 34% of the population recorded as White British, the lowest White British proportion in Waltham Forest.

Once a more traditional, working class district, it has become much more gentrified and expensive in recent years. A number of articles have referenced the large numbers of young professionals and other university-educated people moving into Leyton, and its subsequent gentrification and location as a current &#x27;hot spot&#x27; to buy in. The area was referenced in the July 2015 edition of Vogue (magazine), which said: &quot;All eyes are on Leyton and Stratford [right now].&quot; More widely in Waltham Forest, the borough has seen an influx of those who cannot afford higher house prices or rent in neighbouring Hackney as well as areas such as Bethnal Green and Bow in the nearby London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Related to this, Waltham Forest has been one of the fastest rising boroughs in terms of house prices since 2013.

==Facilities==
 The New Spitalfields Market, relocated in 1991 from the Old Spitalfields market, is the UK&#x27;s leading horticultural market specialising in exotic fruit and vegetables.

There are two main shopping areas in the district, located at opposite ends of the High Road. There is a large retail park at Leyton Mills, next to the station. This has a large, 24-hour Asda store, a B&amp;Q store and a selection of furniture and electrical stores. At the north end of the town, Baker&#x27;s Arms has a more traditional selection of shops lining Lea Bridge Road and the High Road, including a branch of Tesco.

The newly built local police station is at Boreham Close near Leyton Midland Road station. It moved from Francis Road in December 2012.

Restaurants reflect the diversity of Leyton&#x27;s population, with cuisines on offer including Turkish, Portuguese, Polish, Indian, Mauritian, Somali and Cypriot. There are also several fast-food takeaway shops, cafes and bakeries.

Leyton lies on the eastern side of the Hackney Marshes, one of the largest areas of open land in London. A bridge to the marshes crosses the Orient Way road and railway tracks from Leyton Jubilee Park, which was created as a merger of two previously separate playing fields to mark the 60th anniversary of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.

 A major focal point in the centre of Leyton is Coronation Gardens, a park built in 1902 to commemorate the coronation that year of King Edward VII. It includes a fountain, landscaped gardens, a bandstand and a children&#x27;s maze.

On the High Road, near the site of the Bakers Arms, there is also a municipal gym and Leyton Leisure Centre swimming pool, which was formerly called the Leyton Leisure Lagoon and was reopened in October 2013 following a period of renovation.

There are two public libraries in Leyton. One on the High Road next door to the former Town Hall, and the other on Lea Bridge Road which has been recently modernised to offer extensive computer facilities.

The London Borough of Waltham Forest also operates Brooks Farm, a city farm in Skelton Lane Park, near Leyton Midland Road station. It is free to visitors and the livestock include pigs, sheep, cows, horses and llamas.

A recent regeneration of Ive Farm Fields in 2018 has brought a host of new facilities to the area, with floodlit sports pitches, a running track, volleyball courts and a series of walking routes. In memory of those who lost their lives in Waltham Forest during the Covid pandemic, a memorial plaque and tree has been placed in Jubilee Park as a tribute.
==Housing==


The majority of homes in the area consists of Victorian and Edwardian terraces built between 1870 and 1910 during Leyton&#x27;s phase of rapid development from what had been a small village at the beginning of the 1800s. These properties range in size from two- to seven-bedroom houses. As a result, the area is popular with families.

Large-scale redevelopment and inner city regeneration has been underway in Leyton for many years, as is also the case in the neighbouring areas of Hackney, Bow, Clapton and Stratford. Leyton&#x27;s skyline is comparatively low-rise compared to other districts of east London. High-rise estates once dominated the horizon, but the towers were unpopular with many residents and considered to be poorly constructed. The Oliver Close and Cathall Road estates were the first to be completely redeveloped by demolition and rebuilding with the help of the multimillion-pound Waltham Forest Housing Action Trust scheme during the early 2000s. The redevelopment of the problematic Avenue Road Estate followed. 

Demolition of the last large high-rise estate in the area, the Beaumont Road Estate, began in 2006. It has since been almost completely redeveloped. The only remaining 20-storey tower block left in Waltham Forest – from a 1970s peak of 20 across the borough – is the Northwood Tower in Walthamstow. However, smaller 1960s-built blocks, such the 10-storey Slade Tower in the Leyton Grange estate, still dot the area. A host of modern apartment buildings have also been built since the late 1990s, including the flats built at each end of Leyton Orient Football Club&#x27;s Brisbane Road stadium. There is now further development taking place opposite Coronation Gardens and the Stadium with 750 new homes set to be built by 2027, known as The Score Centre.

==Sports==

The town is the home to the football club, Leyton Orient F.C., viewed by many residents as one of the most important parts of Leyton&#x27;s identity. Orient came to Brisbane Road, Leyton in 1936 from Clapton. The stadium has over time been re-constructed and changed its name from Leyton Stadium to the Matchroom Stadium and is now the Gaughan Group Stadium. Although they reached the top flight of English football when promoted to the Football League First Division in 1962, Orient currently play in League One.

Leyton Orient&#x27;s future in the heart of Leyton is uncertain. In October 2011, Orient submitted a request to the Football League to move into and become tenants of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium, following complaints over West Ham United being given a 99-year lease of the stadium. Orient said that the stadium was too close to their stadium, which they said would breach FA rules. There has also been talk of the club moving into the 15,000 seater Riverbank Arena.

Leyton F.C. (between 1975 and 1992 called &quot;Leyton Wingate&quot;) was founded in 1868, and until January 2011 played in the Isthmian League Division One North at the Leyton Stadium in Lea Bridge Road. Leyton FC amalgamated with Walthamstow Pennant FC, in 1995 and renamed as Leyton Pennant FC. In 1994, they changed their name again to Waltham Forest FC.

Leyton also has a cricket pitch and pavilion, which was the former home of Essex County Cricket Club. In 1886, the club purchased Leyton Cricket Ground in the High Road, which became their headquarters until 1933; however, they continued to play at Leyton until 1977. The pavilion (a Grade II listed building) still stands today as part of Leyton Youth Centre.

Wapping Hockey Club and East London Hockey Club are field hockey clubs that both play at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre, and compete in the Women&#x27;s England Hockey League and the London Hockey League.

The Lee Valley Ice Centre is home to the Lea Valley Lions Ice Hockey Club who play in the English National Ice Hockey League.

Leyton borders the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympic Games. The training facilities at the Waltham Forest Pool &amp; Track were used by Olympians to prepare for the Games.

Also in Leyton is the Lee Valley VeloPark, which has a 6,000-seat indoor velodrome for track cycling and a 6,000-seat outdoor BMX racing track. The Lee Valley Tennis and Hockey centres at Eton Manor are also due to open to the public in late 2013. The London Legacy Development Corporation said this North Park area, the first section of the Olympic Park to reopen to the public after the 2012 Games, will &quot;be a valuable area of open green space for the neighbouring communities&quot; and &quot;a place for jogging, kickabouts, children’s play and family picnics&quot;.

==Education==
Leyton has a number of secondary schools, including George Mitchell School, Lammas School and Norlington School. There is also a college, Leyton Sixth Form College, which is the second sixth form college in Southern England to get a licence, and the best college in London for sport.

==Transport==
Leyton is on the Central line of London Underground, with the station located at the southern end of the High Road. There is a London Overground station at Midland Road on the Gospel Oak to Barking line.

Leyton is served by a number of London bus routes day and night.

Central London may be reached by bicycle from Lea Bridge Road following the London Cycle Network Route 9 through Hackney and Shoreditch.

<text>In mathematical analysis, the Lagrange inversion theorem, also known as the Lagrange–Bürmann formula, gives the Taylor series expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function. Lagrange inversion is a special case of the inverse function theorem.

==Statement==

Suppose is defined as a function of by an equation of the form

:formula_1

where is analytic at a point and formula_2 Then it is possible to &quot;invert&quot; or &quot;solve&quot; the equation for , expressing it in the form formula_3 given by a power series
:formula_4
where
:formula_5

The theorem further states that this series has a non-zero radius of convergence, i.e., formula_6 represents an analytic function of in a neighbourhood of formula_7 This is also called reversion of series.

If the assertions about analyticity are omitted, the formula is also valid for formal power series and can be generalized in various ways: It can be formulated for functions of several variables; it can be extended to provide a ready formula for for any analytic function ; and it can be generalized to the case formula_8 where the inverse is a multivalued function.

The theorem was proved by Lagrange and generalized by Hans Heinrich Bürmann, both in the late 18th century. There is a straightforward derivation using complex analysis and contour integration; the complex formal power series version is a consequence of knowing the formula for polynomials, so the theory of analytic functions may be applied. Actually, the machinery from analytic function theory enters only in a formal way in this proof, in that what is really needed is some property of the formal residue, and a more direct formal proof is available. In fact, the Lagrange inversion theorem has a number of additional rather different proofs, including ones using tree-counting arguments or induction.
If is a formal power series, then the above formula does not give the coefficients of the compositional inverse series directly in terms for the coefficients of the series . If one can express the functions and in formal power series as

:formula_9

with and , then an explicit form of inverse coefficients can be given in term of Bell polynomials:

:formula_10

where
:formula_11
is the rising factorial. 

When , the last formula can be interpreted in terms of the faces of associahedra 

:formula_12 

where formula_13 for each face formula_14 of the associahedron formula_15

==Example==
For instance, the algebraic equation of degree 
:formula_16
can be solved for by means of the Lagrange inversion formula for the function , resulting in a formal series solution

:formula_17

By convergence tests, this series is in fact convergent for formula_18 which is also the largest disk in which a local inverse to can be defined.

==Applications==

===Lagrange–Bürmann formula===

There is a special case of Lagrange inversion theorem that is used in combinatorics and applies when formula_19 for some analytic formula_20 with formula_21 Take formula_22 to obtain formula_23 Then for the inverse formula_6 (satisfying formula_25), we have

:formula_26

which can be written alternatively as

:formula_27

where formula_28 is an operator which extracts the coefficient of formula_29 in the Taylor series of a function of .

A generalization of the formula is known as the Lagrange–Bürmann formula:
:formula_30

where is an arbitrary analytic function.

Sometimes, the derivative can be quite complicated. A simpler version of the formula replaces with to get 

:formula_31

which involves instead of .

===Lambert &quot;W&quot; function===
The Lambert function is the function formula_32 that is implicitly defined by the equation

:formula_33

We may use the theorem to compute the Taylor series of formula_32 at formula_35 We take formula_36 and formula_37 Recognizing that

:formula_38

this gives

:formula_39

The radius of convergence of this series is formula_40 (giving the principal branch of the Lambert function).

A series that converges for formula_41 (approximately formula_42) can also be derived by series inversion. The function formula_43 satisfies the equation

:formula_44

Then formula_45 can be expanded into a power series and inverted. This gives a series for formula_46

:formula_47

formula_48 can be computed by substituting formula_49 for in the above series. For example, substituting for gives the value of formula_50

===Binary trees===

Consider the set formula_51 of unlabelled binary trees. An element of formula_51 is either a leaf of size zero, or a root node with two subtrees. Denote by formula_53 the number of binary trees on formula_54 nodes.

Removing the root splits a binary tree into two trees of smaller size. This yields the functional equation on the generating function formula_55
:formula_56

Letting formula_57, one has thus formula_58 Applying the theorem with formula_59 yields
:formula_60

This shows that formula_53 is the th Catalan number.

=== Asymptotic approximation of integrals===
In the Laplace–Erdelyi theorem that gives the asymptotic approximation for Laplace-type integrals, the function inversion is taken as a crucial step.

<doc id="94161" wikidata="Q123741" url="?curid=94161" title="Limehouse">
<text>Limehouse is a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London. It is east of Charing Cross, on the northern bank of the River Thames. Its proximity to the river has given it a strong maritime character, which it retains through its riverside public houses and steps, such as The Grapes and Limehouse Stairs.

The area gives its name to Limehouse Reach, a section of the Thames which runs south to Millwall after making a right-angled bend at Cuckold&#x27;s Point, Rotherhithe. The west-to-east section upstream of Cuckold&#x27;s Point is properly called the Lower Pool.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name relates to the local lime kilns or, more precisely, lime oasts, by the river. The name is from Old English &quot;līm-āst&quot; &quot;lime-oast&quot;, and appears in a 1335 record.

The name is found used in 1417:Inquisicio capta sup&#x27; litus Thomisie apud Lymhosteys pro morte Thome Frank.
(&quot;Inquest held on the shore of the Thames by Lymhosteys for the death of Thomas Frank&quot;)
17 Aug, 5 Henry V. [A.D. 1417], inquest held before &quot;les Lymehostes&quot; within the liberty and franchise of the City, before Henry Bartone, the Mayor, and the King&#x27;s Escheator, as to the cause of the death of Thomas Franke, of Herewich, late steersman (conductor) or &quot;lodysman&quot; of a ship called &quot;la Mary Knyght&quot; of Danzsk in Prussia. A jury sworn, viz., John Baille, Matthew Holme, Robert Marle, Henry Mark, Alexander Bryan, John Goby, Richard Hervy, Walter Steel, Peter West, Richard Stowell, John Dyse, and Walter Broun. They find that the said Thomas Franke was killed by falling on the sharp end of an anchor

===Administrative history===
The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets), under the leadership of the Lord-Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets (the post was always filled by the Constable of the Tower of London).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Limehouse became part of the new County of London in 1889. In 1900, metropolitan boroughs were created for the County of London, and Limehouse became a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. In 1965, the County of London was replaced by Greater London, and Stepney borough merged with neighbouring boroughs to form Tower Hamlets.

===Maritime links===

From its foundation, Limehouse, like neighbouring Wapping, has enjoyed better links with the river than the land, the land route being across a marsh. Limehouse became a significant port in late medieval times. Although most cargoes were discharged in the Pool of London before the establishment of the docks, industries such as shipbuilding, ship chandlering and rope making were established in Limehouse.

Limehouse Basin opened in 1820 as the &quot;Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock&quot;. This was an important connection between the Thames and the canal system, where cargoes could be transferred from larger ships to the shallow-draught canal boats. This mix of vessels can still be seen in the Basin: canal narrowboats rubbing shoulders with seagoing yachts.

From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crews would be found wherever they were available – foreign sailors in their own waters being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in ports around the world. Crews would be paid off at the end of their voyages and, inevitably, permanent communities of foreign sailors became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinese communities developed at Shadwell, Limehouse and the adjoining Pennyfields area of Poplar. These were established by the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades, particularly Han Chinese. The area achieved notoriety for opium dens in the late 19th century, often featured in pulp fiction works by Sax Rohmer and others. Like much of the East End it remained a focus for immigration, but after the devastation of the Second World War many of the Chinese community relocated to Soho.

On 12 February 1832, the first case of cholera was reported in London at Limehouse. First described in India in 1817, it had spread here via Hamburg. Although 800 people died during this epidemic, it was fewer than had died of tuberculosis in the same year. Unfortunately, cholera visited again in 1848 and 1858.

The use of Limehouse Basin as a major distribution hub declined with the growth of the railways, although the revival of canal traffic during World War I and World War II gave it a brief swansong. Today, Stepney Historical Trust works to advance the public&#x27;s education in the history of the area.

===Post-industrial regeneration===

Limehouse Basin was amongst the first docks to close in the late 1960s. By 1981, Limehouse shared the docklands-wide physical, social and economic decline which led to the setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation. In November 1982, the LDDC published its Limehouse Area Development Strategy. This built on existing plans for Limehouse Basin, and offered a discussion framework for future development, housing refurbishment and environmental improvements across the whole of Limehouse. It was based on four major projects: Limehouse Basin, Free Trade Wharf, what was then known as the Light Rapid Transit Route (DLR) and the Docklands Northern Relief Road, a road corridor between The Highway and East India Dock across the north of the Isle of Dogs.

In the mid-1980s, developments on the nearby Isle of Dogs (particularly at Canary Wharf), proved to be the catalyst to delivering infrastructure improvements which benefitted Limehouse and some other areas of the London Docklands.

The sheer scale of the Canary Wharf proposals, and, in due course, the rapid implementation of the first phase of development, provided the impetus to the transport improvements which completely altered prospects for Limehouse as well as for the Isle of Dogs. The derelict Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock was converted into Limehouse Marina.

The Troxy concert venue is located in Limehouse on the Commercial Road.

==Politics==

On 30 July 1909, the Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George made a polemical speech in Limehouse attacking the House of Lords for its opposition to his &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; and speaking of the Budget&#x27;s social aims. This was the origin of the verb &#x27;to Limehouse&#x27;, &quot;To make fiery (political) speeches such as Mr. Lloyd George made at Limehouse in 1909&quot;.

From 1906 to 1909, Clement Attlee worked as manager of Haileybury House, a club for working class boys in Limehouse run by his old school. Before this, Attlee&#x27;s political views had been conservative, but he was shocked by the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with slum children, and this caused him to become a socialist. He joined the Independent Labour Party in 1908, and became mayor of Stepney in 1919. At the 1922 general election, Attlee became Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Limehouse, which he represented while Deputy Prime Minister. After WWII, in 1950, he moved constituencies to Walthamstow West.

On 25 January 1981, MPs Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, William Rodgers and David Owen made the Limehouse Declaration from the bridge over Limehouse Cut in Narrow Street: it announced the formation of the Council for Social Democracy in opposition to the granting of block votes to the trade unions in the Labour Party to which they had previously belonged. They soon became leading politicians in the Social Democratic Party.

Today, Limehouse is part of the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse and has been represented in the House of Commons since 2019 by Apsana Begum MP (Independent), and in the London Assembly since 2016 by Unmesh Desai AM (Labour).

==In popular culture==
The area inspired Douglas Furber (lyricist) and Philip Braham (composer) in 1921 to write the popular jazz standard &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot;, which was introduced by Jack Buchanan and Gertrude Lawrence in the musical revue &quot;A to Z&quot;. Much later, it was reprised in the ballet &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot; featuring Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer in the musical film &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946) and by Julie Andrews in &quot;Star!&quot; (1968). In both instances the actors were in yellowface. Other notable performances on film include those by Hoagy Carmichael in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944) and by Borrah Minevich and His Harmonica Rascals in &quot;One in a Million&quot; (1936). &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot; was also the name of a 1934 film, starring George Raft.

Thomas Burke wrote &quot;Limehouse Nights&quot; (1916), a collection of stories centred around life in the poverty-stricken Limehouse district of London. Many of Burke&#x27;s books feature the Chinese character Quong Lee as narrator. The area also features in the &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; books of Sax Rohmer, where a Limehouse opium den serves as the hideout of the Chinese supervillain. The notion of East End opium dens seems to have originated with a description by Charles Dickens of a visit he made to an opium den in nearby Bluegate Fields, which inspired certain scenes in his last, unfinished, novel &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1870). More recently, the popular graphic novels of Alan Moore, &quot;From Hell&quot; (1989) and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (1999) contain a number of references to the notorious criminality of the area in Victorian London. Victorian-era Limehouse was also the setting of the novel &quot;Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem&quot; (1995) by Peter Ackroyd, a fictionalized account of the notorious &#x27;Limehouse Golem&#x27; serial murders.

The area also appeared in Anna May Wong&#x27;s 1929 film &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, where, as the toughly alluring Shosho, Wong was said to embody the Limehouse Chinatown mystique. The Limehouse district of London is depicted in the silent film &quot;Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl&quot; (1919), directed by D. W. Griffith, &quot;where the Orient squats at the portals of the West&quot;. Limehouse is also the setting of the 1926 film &quot;The Blackbird&quot;, directed by Tod Browning and starring Lon Chaney. The Limehouse district features prominently in the 1942 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror&quot;, when Holmes enlists the aid of rather unsavory residents to help catch a Nazi agent.

==Society==

St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse was built by Nicholas Hawksmoor. A pyramid originally planned to be put atop the tower now stands in the graveyard. The church is next door to Limehouse Town Hall and close to Limehouse Library, both Grade II listed buildings, the former now used as a community centre and the latter as a hotel. Across the road is the Sailors&#x27; Mission, where Situationist International held its conference in 1960. The building subsequently became a run-down hostel for the homeless which became notorious for its squalor, although it has since been converted into a luxury apartment block.

Further to the southwest, Narrow Street, Limehouse&#x27;s historic spine, which runs along the back of the Thames wharves, boasts one of the few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the &quot;Six Jolly Fellowship Porters&quot; in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. A few doors along was Booty&#x27;s Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building on the other side of Narrow Street was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker &amp; Co&#x27;s Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as &#x27;The House They Left Behind&#x27;, because it was the only Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.

Further along the street is &#x27;Bread Street Kitchen on the River&#x27;, a gastropub, now run by Gordon Ramsay. It is housed in the Grade II listed, former dockmaster&#x27;s and customs house, for Limehouse Dock.

==Education==
The Stepney Greencoat School is a Church of England primary school that was founded in 1710 by leading community members to local children, it has served the area as it transformed from an industrial to the mixed, multicultural settlement that Limehouse has become today.

==Transport==
Limehouse station, opened in 1987, is served by National Rail c2c and Docklands Light Railway. On 22 April 1991, two trains collided between Limehouse and Poplar during morning rush hour, requiring a shutdown of the system and evacuation of passengers by ladder.

A number of London Buses routes serve Limehouse, including routes 15, 115, 135, D3 and night bus routes N15, N550 and N551.
Limehouse is connected to the National Road Network by the A13 Commercial Road which passes west–east through Limehouse, while the A1203 Limehouse Link tunnel passes under Limehouse Basin, linking The Highway with the Docklands Northern Relief Road. The northern entrance of the Rotherhithe Tunnel emerges in Limehouse, to the west of the Basin and close to Limehouse railway station.

Narrow Street forms a part of the north bank of the Thames Path and had previously been the principal street in Limehouse. It includes the Cycleway 3 between Tower Gateway to Barking, one of London&#x27;s first Cycle Superhighways.

Though no longer a working dock, Limehouse Basin with its marina remains a working facility. The same is not true of the wharf buildings that have survived, most of which are now highly desirable residential properties. Limehouse Basin connects to the Regent&#x27;s Canal via the Commercial Road Lock to the north, and the River Thames via Limehouse Basin Lock to the south. The Limehouse Cut connects the Basin to the River Lea in the east.

==Notable residents==

Sir Humphrey Gilbert lived here, and was an advocate of opening up the Northwest Passage. This inspired Martin Frobisher to sail to Baffin Island, and he returned with a mysterious black rock. Gilbert set up the Society of the New Art with Lord Burghley and the Earl of Leicester, who had their alchemical laboratory in Limehouse; however, their attempts to transmute the black rock into gold proved fruitless. (Humphrey&#x27;s brother Adrian Gilbert was reputed a great alchemist and worked closely with John Dee.) 

Captain Christopher Newport lived in Limehouse for several years up until 1595. He rose through the sailing ranks from a poor cabin boy to a wealthy English privateer and eventually one of the Masters of the Royal Navy. He became rich pirating Spanish treasure vessels in the West Indies. In 1607 he sailed the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, followed by the &quot;Godspeed&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;, as Admiral of the Fleet to Jamestown. He helped secure England&#x27;s foothold in North America through five voyages to Jamestown. He sailed his entire life, dying on a trading voyage to Bantam, on the island of Java in present-day Indonesia. His sailing experience in Limehouse made him known as Captain Christopher Newport, of Limehouse, Mariner.

Charles Dickens&#x27; godfather, Christopher Huffam, ran his sailmaking business from 12 Church Row (Newell Street). Huffam is said to be the inspiration for the Paul Dombey character in Dickens&#x27; &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;.

James McNeill Whistler and Charles Napier Hemy sketched and painted at locations on Narrow Street&#x27;s river waterfront.

Contemporary residents include the actor Sir Ian McKellen, Matthew Parris, comedy actress Cleo Rocos, actor Steven Berkoff, comedian Lee Hurst , as well as politician Lord David Owen. Limehouse was also the home of the late film director Sir David Lean.

<doc id="94166" wikidata="Q870863" url="?curid=94166" title="Bolt action">
<text>Bolt action is a type of manual firearm action that is operated by &quot;directly&quot; manipulating the turn-bolt via a bolt handle, most commonly placed on the right-hand side of the firearm (as most users are right-handed). The majority of bolt-action firearms are rifles, but there are also some variants of shotguns and handguns that are bolt-action.

Bolt action firearms are generally repeating firearms, but many single-shot designs are available particularly in shooting sports where single-shot firearms are mandated, such as most Olympic and ISSF rifle disciplines.

From the late 19th century all the way through both World Wars, bolt action rifles were the standard infantry service weapons for most of the world&#x27;s military forces, with the exception of the United States Armed Forces, who used the M1 Garand Semi-automatic rifle. In modern military and law enforcement after the Second World War, bolt-action firearms have been largely replaced by semi-automatic and selective-fire firearms, and have remained only as sniper rifles due to the design&#x27;s inherent potential for superior accuracy and precision, as well as ruggedness and reliability compared to self-loading designs.

Most bolt action firearms use a &quot;rotating bolt&quot; operation, where the handle must first be rotated upward to unlock the bolt from the receiver, then pulled back to open the breech and allowing any spent cartridge case to be extracted and ejected. This also cocks the striker within the bolt (either on opening or closing of the bolt depending on the gun design) and engages it against the sear. When the bolt is returned to the forward position, a new cartridge (if available) is pushed out of the magazine and into the barrel chamber, and finally the breech is closed tight by rotating the handle down so the bolt head relocks on the receiver. A less common bolt-action type is the &quot;straight-pull&quot; mechanism, where no upward handle-turning is needed and the bolt unlocks automatically when the handle is pulled rearwards by the user&#x27;s hand.

==History==
The first bolt action rifle was produced in 1824 by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse, following work on breechloading rifles that dated to the 18th century. Von Dreyse would perfect his &quot;Nadelgewehr&quot; (Needle Rifle) by 1836, and it was adopted by the Prussian Army in 1841. While it saw limited service in the German Revolutions of 1848, it was not fielded widely until the 1864 victory over Denmark. In 1850 a metallic centerfire bolt-action breechloader was patented by Béatus Beringer. In 1852 another metallic centerfire bolt-action breechloader was patented by Joseph Needham and improved upon in 1862 with another patent. Two different systems for primers –the mechanism to ignite a metallic cartridge&#x27;s powder charge – were invented in the 1860s as well, the Berdan and the Boxer systems.

The United States purchased 900 Greene rifles (an under hammer, percussion capped, single-shot bolt-action that used paper cartridges and an ogival bore rifling system) in 1857, which saw service at the Battle of Antietam in 1862, during the American Civil War; however, this weapon was ultimately considered too complicated for issue to soldiers and was supplanted by the Springfield Model 1861, a conventional muzzle loading rifle. During the American Civil War, the bolt-action Palmer carbine was patented in 1863, and by 1865, 1000 were purchased for use as cavalry weapons. The French Army adopted its first bolt-action rifle, the Chassepot rifle, in 1866 and followed with the metallic cartridge bolt-action Gras rifle in 1874.

European armies continued to develop bolt-action rifles through the latter half of the 19th century, first adopting tubular magazines as on the Kropatschek rifle and the Lebel rifle. The first bolt-action repeating rifle was patented in Britain in 1855 by an unidentified inventor through the patent agent Auguste Edouard Loradoux Bellford using a gravity-operated tubular magazine in the stock. Another more well-known bolt-action repeating rifle was the Vetterli rifle of 1867 and the first bolt-action repeating rifle to use centerfire cartridges was the weapon designed by the Viennese gunsmith Ferdinand Fruwirth in 1871. Ultimately, the military turned to bolt-action rifles using a box magazine; the first of its kind was the M1885 Remington–Lee, but the first to be generally adopted was the British 1888 Lee–Metford. World War I marked the height of the bolt-action rifle&#x27;s use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs.

During the buildup prior to World War II, the military bolt-action rifle began to be superseded by semi-automatic rifles and later fully automatic rifles, though bolt-action rifles remained the primary weapon of most of the combatants for the duration of the war; and many American units, especially the USMC, used bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles until sufficient numbers of M1 Garand rifles were made available. The bolt-action is still common today among many sniper rifles, as the design has the potential for superior accuracy, reliability, reduced weight, and the ability to control loading over the faster rate of fire that all semi-automatic rifle alternatives allow. There are, however, many semi-automatic rifle designs used especially in the designated marksman role.

Today, bolt-action rifles are chiefly used as hunting and target rifles. These rifles can be used to hunt anything from vermin to deer and to large game, especially big game caught on a safari, as they are adequate to deliver a single lethal shot from a safe distance. Target shooters favour single-shot bolt actions for their simplicity of design, reliability, and accuracy.

Bolt-action shotguns are considered a rarity among modern firearms but were formerly a commonly used action for .410 entry-level shotguns, as well as for low-cost 12-gauge shotguns. The M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System (MASS) is the most recent and advanced example of a bolt-action shotgun, albeit one designed to be attached to an M16 rifle or M4 carbine using an underbarrel mount (although with the standalone kit, the MASS can become a standalone weapon). Mossberg 12-gauge bolt-action shotguns were briefly popular in Australia after the 1997 changes to firearms laws, but the shotguns themselves were awkward to operate and had only a three-round magazine, thus offering no practical or real advantages over a conventional double-barreled shotgun.

Some pistols use a bolt-action system, although this is uncommon, and such examples are typically specialized hunting and target handguns.

==Major bolt-action systems==
===Rotating bolt===

Most of the bolt-action designs use a rotating bolt (or &quot;turn pull&quot;) design, which involves the shooter doing an upward &quot;rotating&quot; movement of the handle to unlock the bolt from the breech and cock the firing pin, followed by a rearward &quot;pull&quot; to open the breech, extract the spent cartridge case, then reverse the whole process to chamber the next cartridge and relock the breech. There are four major turn bolt-action designs: the Remington M-700, possibly the single most numerous produced rifle in history which is now also used as basis for most custom competition rifle actions, along with the Mauser system, the Lee–Enfield system, and the Mosin–Nagant system. 

All four differ in the way the bolt fits into the receiver, how the bolt rotates as it is being operated, the number of locking lugs holding the bolt in place as the gun is fired, and whether the action is cocked on the opening of the bolt (as in both the Mauser system and the Mosin Nagant system) or the closing of the bolt (as in the Lee–Enfield system). The vast majority of modern bolt-action rifles were made for the commercial market post-war, numbering in the tens of millions by Remington in the unique, and most accurate Model 700, two of the others use the Mauser system, with other designs such as the Lee–Enfield system and the Mosin Nagant system, of only limited usage.

====Mauser====
The Mauser bolt-action system is based on 19th-century Mauser bolt-action rifle designs and was finalized in the Gewehr 98 designed by Paul Mauser. It is the most common bolt-action system in the world, being in use in nearly all modern hunting rifles and the majority of military bolt-action rifles until the middle of the 20th century. The Mauser system is stronger than that of the Lee–Enfield system, due to two locking lugs just behind the bolt head, which make it better able to handle higher-pressure cartridges (i.e. magnum cartridges). The 9.3×64mm Brenneke and 8×68mm S magnum rifle cartridge &quot;families&quot; were designed for the Mauser M 98 bolt-action.

A novel safety feature was the introduction of a third locking lug present at the rear of the bolt that normally did not lock the bolt, since it would introduce asymmetrical locking forces. The Mauser system features &quot;cock on opening&quot;, meaning the upward rotation of the bolt when the rifle is opened cocks the action. A drawback of the Mauser M 98 system is that it cannot be cheaply mass-produced very easily. Many Mauser M 98-inspired derivatives feature technical alterations, such as omitting the third safety locking lug, to simplify production.

The controlled-feed on the Mauser M 98 bolt-action system is simple, strong, safe, and well-thought-out design that has inspired other military and sporting rifle designs that became available during the 20th century, including the:
*Gewehr 98/Standardmodell/Karabiner 98k
*M24 series
*vz. 24/vz. 33
*Type 24 rifle
*M1903 Springfield
*Pattern 1914 Enfield
*M1917 Enfield
*Arisaka Type 38/Type 99
*M48 Mauser
*Kb wz. 98a/Karabinek wz. 1929
*FR 7/FR 8
*modern hunting/sporting rifles like the CZ 550, Heym Express Magnum, Winchester Model 70 and the Mauser M 98
*modern sniper rifles like the Sako TRG, Accuracy International Arctic Warfare and GOL Sniper Magnum

Versions of the Mauser action designed prior to the Gewehr 98&#x27;s introduction, such as that of the Swedish Mauser rifles and carbines, lack the third locking lug and feature a &quot;cock on closing&quot; operation.

====Lee–Enfield====
The Lee–Enfield bolt-action system was introduced in 1889 with the Lee–Metford and later Lee–Enfield rifles (the bolt system is named after the designer James Paris Lee and the barrel rifling after the Royal Small Arms Factory in the London Borough of Enfield), and is a &quot;cock on closing&quot; action in which the forward thrust of the bolt cocks the action. This enables a shooter to keep eyes on sights and targets uninterrupted when cycling the bolt. The ability of the bolt to flex between the lugs and chamber, which also keeps the shooter safer in case of a catastrophic chamber overpressure failure. 

The disadvantage of the rearward-located bolt lugs is that a larger part of the receiver, between chamber and lugs, must be made stronger and heavier to resist stretching forces. Also, the bolt ahead of the lugs may flex on firing which, although a safety advantage with repeated firing over time, this may lead to a stretched receiver and excessive headspacing, which if perceived as a problem can be remedied by changing the removable bolt head to a larger sized one (the Lee–Enfield bolt manufacture involved a mass production method where at final assembly the bolt body was fitted with one of three standard size bolt heads for correct headspace). In the years leading up to World War II, the Lee–Enfield bolt system was used in numerous commercial sporting and hunting rifles manufactured by such firms in the United Kingdom as BSA, LSA, and Parker–Hale, as well as by SAF Lithgow in Australia. Vast numbers of ex-military SMLE Mk III rifles were sporterised post WWII to create cheap, effective hunting rifles, and the Lee–Enfield bolt system is used in the M10 and No 4 Mk IV rifles manufactured by Australian International Arms. Rifle Factory Ishapore of India manufactures a hunting and sporting rifle chambered in .315 which also employs the Lee Enfield action.

====Mosin–Nagant====

The Mosin–Nagant action, created in 1891 and named after the designers Sergei Mosin and Léon Nagant, differs significantly from the Mauser and Lee–Enfield bolt-action designs. The Mosin–Nagant design has a separate bolthead that rotates with the bolt and the bearing lugs, in contrast to the Mauser system where the bolthead is a non-removable part of the bolt. The Mosin–Nagant is also unlike the Lee–Enfield system where the bolthead remains stationary and the bolt body itself rotates. The Mosin–Nagant bolt is a somewhat complicated affair, but is extremely rugged and durable; like the Mauser, it uses a &quot;cock on open&quot; system. Although this bolt system has been rarely used in commercial sporting rifles (the Vostok brand target rifles being the most recognized) and has never been exported outside of Russia, although large numbers of military surplus Mosin–Nagant rifles have been sporterized for use as hunting rifles in the following years since the end of World War II.

====Swing====
The Swing was developed in 1970 in the United Kingdom as a purpose-built target rifle for use in NRA competition. Fullbore target rifle competitions historically used accurised examples of the prevailing service rifle, but it was felt these had reached the end of their development potential.

The Swing bolt featured four lugs on the bolt head, at 45 degrees when closed - splitting the difference between the vertically locking Mauser and horizontally locking Enfield bolt designs. Supplied with Schultz &amp; Larsen barrels and a trigger derived from the Finnish Mantari, the Swing was commercially successful, with the basic design reused in the Paramount, RPA Quadlock and Millenium rifles.

====Other designs====

The Vetterli rifle was the first bolt-action repeating rifle introduced by an army. It was used by the Swiss army from 1869 to circa 1890. Modified Vetterlis were also used by the Italian Army. Another notable design is the Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen, which was used by Norway, Denmark, and briefly the United States. It is unusual among bolt-action rifles in that is loaded through a gate on the right side of the receiver, and thus can be reloaded without opening the bolt. 

The Norwegian and Danish versions of the Krag have two locking lugs, while the American version has only one. In all versions, the bolt handle itself serves as an emergency locking lug. The Krag&#x27;s major disadvantage compared to other bolt-action designs is that it is usually loaded by hand, one round at a time, although a box-like device was made that could drop five rounds into the magazine, all at once via a stripper or en bloc clip. This made it slower to reload than other designs which used stripper or en bloc clips. Another historically important bolt-action system was the Gras system, used on the French Mle 1874 Gras rifle, Mle 1886 Lebel rifle (which was the first to introduce ammunition loaded with nitrocellulose-based smokeless powder), and the Berthier series of rifles.

===Straight pull===

Straight-pull bolt-actions differ from conventional turn-pull bolt-action mechanisms in that the bolt can be cycled back and forward without rotating the handle and thus only a linear motion is required, as opposed to a traditional bolt-action, where the user has to axially rotate the bolt in addition to the linear motions to perform chambering and primary extraction. The bolt locking of a straight pull action is achieved differently without needing manual inputs, therefore the entire operating cycle needs the shooter to perform only two movements (pull back and push forward), instead of four movements (rotate up, pull back, push forward, and rotate down), this greatly increases the rate of fire of the gun.

In 1993, the German Blaser company introduced the Blaser R93, a new straight pull action where locking is achieved by a series of concentric &quot;claws&quot; that protrude/retract from the bolthead, a design that is referred to as &quot;Radialbundverschluss&quot; (&quot;radial connection&quot;). As of 2017 the Rifle Shooter magazine listed its successor Blaser R8 as one of the three most popular straight pull rifles together with Merkel Helix and Browning Maral. Some other notable modern straight pull rifles are made by Beretta, C.G. Haenel, Chapuis, Heym, Lynx, Rößler, Savage Arms, Strasser, and Steel Action.

Most straight bolt rifles have a firing mechanism without a hammer, but there are some hammer-fired models, such as the Merkel Helix. Firearms using a hammer usually have a comparably longer lock time than hammerless mechanisms.

In the sport of biathlon, because shooting speed is an important performance factor and semi-automatic guns are illegal for race use, straight pull actions are quite common and are used almost exclusively in the Biathlon World Cup. The first company to make the straight pull action for .22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; Peter Fortner junior designed the &quot;Fortner Action&quot;, which was incorporated into the Anschütz 1827 Fortner. The Fortner action is specifically the straight-pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings on the side of the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt&#x27;s housing. With the new design came a new dry fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The action was later used in the centre-fire Heym SR 30.

== Operating the bolt ==
Typically, the bolt consists of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or &quot;lugs&quot;, which serve to lock the bolt in place. The operation can be done via a rotating bolt, a lever, cam action, a locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight pull designs have seen a great deal of use, though manual turn bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt designs when talking about a specific weapon&#x27;s type of action. 

However, both straight pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to a rotating bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or bolt guide rib into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in .22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is a rotating bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin–Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee–Enfield has a lug and guide rib, which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.

=== Bolt knob ===
The bolt knob is the part of the bolt handle that the user grips when loading and reloading the firearm and thereby acts as a cocking handle. On many older firearms, the bolt knob is welded to the bolt handle, and as such becoming an integral part of the bolt handle itself. On many newer firearms, the bolt knob is instead threaded onto the handle, allowing the user to change the original bolt knob for an aftermarket one, either for aesthetical reasons, achieving better grip or similar. The type of threads used vary between firearms. European firearms often use either M6 1 or M8 1.25 threads, for example M6 is used on the SIG Sauer 200 STR, Blaser R93, Blaser R8, CZ 457 and Bergara rifles, while M8 is used on the Sako TRG and SIG Sauer 404. Many American firearms instead use 1/4&quot; 28 TPI (6.35 0.907 mm) or 5/16&quot; 24 TPI (7.9375 1.058 mm) threads. Some other thread types are also used, for example, No. 10 32 TPI (4.826 0.794 mm) as used by Mausingfield. There also exists aftermarket slip-on bolt handle covers which are mounted without having to remove the existing bolt handle. These are often made of either rubber or plastic.

==Reloading==
Most bolt-action firearms are fed by an internal magazine loaded by hand, by en bloc, or by stripper clips, though a number of designs have had a detachable magazine or independent magazine, or even no magazine at all, thus requiring that each round be independently loaded. Generally, the magazine capacity is limited to between two and ten rounds, as it can permit the magazine to be flush with the bottom of the rifle, reduce the weight, or prevent mud and dirt from entering. A number of bolt-actions have a tube magazine, such as along the length of the barrel. In weapons other than large rifles, such as pistols and cannons, there were some manually operated breech-loading weapons. However, the Dreyse Needle fire rifle was the first breech loader to use a rotating bolt design. Johann Nicholas von Dreyse&#x27;s rifle of 1838 was accepted into service by Prussia in 1841, which was in turn developed into the Prussian Model in 1849. The design was a single shot breech-loader and had the now familiar arm sticking out from the side of the bolt, to turn and open the chamber. The entire reloading sequence was a more complex procedure than later designs, however, as the firing pin had to be independently primed and activated, and the lever was used only to move the bolt.

<text>Mayfair is an area of London, England, in the City of Westminster. It is in Central London and part of the West End. It is between Oxford Street, Regent Street, Piccadilly and Park Lane and one of the most expensive districts in the world.

The area was originally part of the manor of Eia and remained largely rural until the early 18th century. It became well-known for the annual May Fair that took place from 1686 to 1764 in what is now Shepherd Market. Over the years, the fair grew increasingly downmarket and unpleasant, and it became a public nuisance. The Grosvenor family (who became Dukes of Westminster) acquired the land through marriage and began to develop it under the direction of Thomas Barlow. The work included Hanover Square, Berkeley Square and Grosvenor Square, which were surrounded by high-quality houses, and St George&#x27;s Hanover Square Church.

By the end of the 18th century, most of Mayfair had been rebuilt with high-value housing for the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its affluent status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to the area becoming more commercial, with many houses converted into offices for corporate headquarters and various embassies. Mayfair retains a substantial quantity of high-end residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and luxury hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane. Its prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London &quot;Monopoly&quot; board.

==Geography==
Mayfair is in the City of Westminster, and mainly consists of the historical Grosvenor estate and the Albemarle, Berkeley, Burlington, and Curzon estates. It is bordered on the west by Park Lane, north by Oxford Street, east by Regent Street, and the south by Piccadilly. Beyond the bounding roads, to the north is Marylebone, to the east Soho, and to the southwest Knightsbridge and Belgravia.

Mayfair is surrounded by parkland; Hyde Park and Green Park run along its boundary. The Grosvenor Square is roughly in the centre of Mayfair, and its centrepiece, containing numerous expensive and desirable properties.

==History==

===Early history===
Following analysis of the alignment of Roman roads, it has been speculated that the Romans settled in the area before establishing Londinium. &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot; suggested that Aulus Plautius built a fort here during the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 while waiting for Claudius. The theory was developed in 1993, with a proposal that a town grew outside the fort but was later abandoned as it was too far from the River Thames. The proposal has been disputed because of lack of archaeological evidence. If there was a fort, it is believed the perimeter would have been where the modern Green Street, North Audley Street, Upper Grosvenor Street and Park Lane now are, and that Park Street would have been the main road through the centre. This area was the manor of Eia in the Domesday Book, and owned by Geoffrey de Mandeville after the Norman Conquest. It was subsequently given to the Abbey of Westminster, who owned it until 1536 when it was taken over by King Henry VIII during the dissolution of the monasteries.

Mayfair consisted mainly of open fields until development began in the Shepherd Market area around 1686–88 to accommodate the May Fair, which had moved from Haymarket in St James&#x27;s because of overcrowding. There were some buildings before 1686. A cottage in Stanhope Row, dating from 1618, was destroyed in the Blitz in late 1940. A 17th-century English Civil War fortification established in what is now Mount Street was known as Oliver&#x27;s Mount by the 18th century.

===The May Fair ===
The May Fair was held every year at Great Brookfield (which is now part of Curzon Street and Shepherd Market) from 1 to 14 May. It was established during the reign of Edward I in open fields beyond St. James. The fair was recorded as &quot;Saint James&#x27;s fayer by Westminster&quot; in 1560. It was postponed in 1603 because of plague, but otherwise continued throughout the 17th century. In 1686, the fair moved to what is now Mayfair. By the 18th century, it had attracted showmen, jugglers and fencers and numerous fairground attractions. Popular attractions included bare-knuckle fighting, semolina-eating contests and women&#x27;s foot racing.

By the reign of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was regarded as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and, with local residents, led a public campaign against it. It was abolished in 1764. One reason for Mayfair&#x27;s subsequent boom in property development was that it was able to keep out lower-class activities.

===Grosvenor family and estates===

Building on Mayfair began in the 1660s on the corner of Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street. Burlington House was started between 1664 and 1665 by John Denham and sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington, who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and is the only one of this era to survive into the 21st century.

The origins of major development began when Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet, married Mary Davies, heiress to part of the Manor of Ebury, in 1677. The Grosvenor family gained of land, of which around lay south of Oxford Street and east of Park Lane. The land was referred to as &quot;The Hundred Acres&quot; in early deeds.

In 1721, the &quot;London Journal&quot; reported &quot;the ground upon which the May Fair formerly was held is marked out for a large square, and several fine streets and houses are to be built upon it&quot;. Sir Richard Grosvenor, 4th Baronet, asked the surveyor Thomas Barlow to design the street layout, which has survived mostly intact to the present day despite most of the properties being rebuilt. Barlow proposed a grid of wide, straight streets, with a large park (now Grosvenor Square) as a centrepiece.

Buildings were constructed in quick succession, and by the mid-18th century the area was covered in houses. Much of the land was owned by seven estates: Burlington, Millfield, Conduit Mead, Albemarle Ground, the Berkeley, the Curzon and, most importantly, the Grosvenor. Of the original properties constructed in Mayfair, only the Grosvenor estate survives intact and owned by the same family, who became the Dukes of Westminster in 1874. Chesterfield Street is one of the few streets that has 18th-century properties on both sides, with a single exception, and is probably the least altered road in the area.
Hanover Square was the first of three great squares to be constructed. It was named after King George I, the Elector of Hanover, soon after his ascension to the throne in 1714. The original houses were inhabited by &quot;persons of distinction&quot; such as retired generals. Although most have been demolished, a small number have survived to the present day. The Hanover Square Rooms became a popular place for classical music concerts, including Johann Christian Bach, Joseph Haydn, Niccolò Paganini and Franz Liszt. A large statue of William Pitt the Younger is sited at the southern end of the square.
In 1725, Mayfair became part of the new parish of St George Hanover Square, which stretched as far east as Bond Street and to Regent Street north of Conduit Street. It ran as far north as Oxford Street and south near to Piccadilly. The parish continued into Hyde Park to the west and extended southwest to St George&#x27;s Hospital. Most of the area belonged to (and continues to be owned by) the Grosvenor family, though the freehold of some parts belongs to the Crown Estate.

A water supply to the area was built by the Chelsea Water Works, and a royal warrant was issued in 1725 for a reservoir in Hyde Park that could supply water at what is now Grosvenor Gate. In 1835, the reservoir was decorated with an ornamental basin and a fountain in its centre. In 1963, following the widening of Park Lane, it was rebuilt as the Joy of Life Fountain.

Grosvenor Square was planned as the centrepiece of the Mayfair estate. It was laid out from 1725–31 with 51 individual plots for development. It is the second-largest square in London (after Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields) and housed numerous members of the aristocracy until the mid-20th century. By the end of the 19th century, the Grosvenor family were described as &quot;the wealthiest family in Europe&quot; and annual rents for their Mayfair properties reached around £135,000 (). The square has never declined in popularity and continues to be a prestigious London address into the 21st century. Only two original houses have survived; No. 9, once the home of John Adams, and No. 38 which is now the Indonesian Embassy.
Berkeley House on Piccadilly was named after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, who had purchased its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House), on condition that the view from the rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides. The west side still has various mid-18th-century buildings, and the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.

The expansion of Mayfair moved upper-class Londoners away from areas such as Covent Garden and Soho, which were already in decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was its proximity to the Court of St James and the parks, and the well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to stables, coach houses and servants&#x27; accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets. Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.

The Rothschild family owned several Mayfair properties in the 19th century. Alfred de Rothschild lived at No. 1 Seamore Place and held numerous &quot;adoration dinners&quot; where the only guest was a female companion. The marriage of his brother Leopold to Marie Perugia took place here in 1881. The house was demolished after the First World War when Curzon Street was extended through the site to meet Park Lane. The future Prime Minister Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, was born in Charles Street in 1847, and grew up in the area.

Mayfair has had a long association with the United States. Pocahontas is believed to have visited in the early 17th century. In 1786, John Adams established the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square. Theodore Roosevelt was married in Hanover Square, and Franklin D. Roosevelt honeymooned in Berkeley Square. A small memorial park in Mount Street Gardens has benches engraved with the names of former American residents in and visitors to Mayfair.

===Modern history===

The death of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal point in the development of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as David Lloyd George&#x27;s establishment of the welfare state in 1909 greatly reduced the power of the Lords. Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.

Following World War I, the British upper class was in decline, for the reduced workforce meant servants were less readily available and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became more expensive to service; consequently, many were converted into foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and move his residence to Bourdon House. Mayfair attracted commercial development after much of the City of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.

In 1961, the old US embassy at No. 1 Grosvenor Square became the Canadian High Commission, and the building was named Macdonald House, after the first Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. The Italian Embassy is at No. 4 Grosvenor Square.

The district has become increasingly commercial, with many offices in converted houses and new buildings, though the trend has been reversed in places. The United States embassy announced in 2008 it would move from its long-established location at Grosvenor Square to Nine Elms, Wandsworth, owing to security concerns, despite constructing an £8m security upgrading after the September 11 attacks including high blast walls. Since the 1990s residential properties have become available again, though the rents are among the highest in London. Mayfair remains one of the most expensive places to live in London and the world, and it possesses some exclusive shopping, London&#x27;s largest concentration of luxury hotels and many restaurants, particularly around Park Lane and Grosvenor Square.

The Al-Thani family, the ruling family of Qatar, and their relatives and associates owned a quarter of the 279 acres of Mayfair by 2006. The north-western part of Mayfair has subsequently been nicknamed &quot;Little Doha&quot;. The area has also been called a &quot;Qatari quarter&quot; and &#x27;Qataropolis&#x27;. Prominent properties owned in Mayfair by Qataris include Dudley House on Park Lane and Lombard House on Curzon Street. Family members also own The Connaught and Claridge&#x27;s hotels in Mayfair through the Maybourne Hotel Group.

==Properties==

===Churches===

St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, constructed between 1721 and 1724 by John James, was one of 50 churches built following the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches Act in 1711. Emma, Lady Hamilton, in 1791, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1814, and Prime Ministers Benjamin Disraeli and H. H. Asquith in 1839 and 1894 respectively were all married in the church. The porch houses two cast-iron dogs rescued from a shop in Conduit Street that was bombed during the Blitz.

Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street was built by Benjamin Timbrell in 1730 for the Grosvenor Estate. It was used by American armed forces during the Second World War. The parents of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, are buried in the churchyard.

The Mayfair Chapel on Curzon Street was a popular place for illegal marriages, including over 700 in 1742. James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton, married Elizabeth Gunning here in 1752. The Marriage Act 1753 stopped the practice of unlicensed marriages. The chapel was demolished in 1899.

===Hotels===
Having opened in 1837, Brown&#x27;s Hotel is considered one of London&#x27;s oldest hotels. Straddling Albemarle and Dover streets, it is thought to have been a popular tea location for Queen Victoria, and it was from the hotel that in 1876 Alexander Graham Bell made the first successful telephone call in Britain. Certain writers were known to stay there frequently; Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;At Bertram&#x27;s Hotel&quot; were each partly written during a visit to Brown&#x27;s. Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed staying at the hotel and married his fiancée Edith Roosevelt with a reception there in 1886. Now part of Rocco Forte Hotels, the Hotel maintains its popular tea room and has expanded to occupy 11 townhouses.
Claridge&#x27;s was founded in 1812 as Mivart&#x27;s Hotel on Brook Street. It was acquired by William Claridge in 1855, who gave it its current name. The hotel was bought by the Savoy Company in 1895 and rebuilt in red brick. It was extended again in 1931. Several European royal families in exile stayed at the hotel during the Second World War. Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia, was born there on 17 July 1945; the Prime Minister Winston Churchill is said to have declared the suite he was born in to be Yugoslav territory.

Flemings Mayfair on Half Moon Street was opened in 1851 by Robert Fleming, who worked for Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey. It is the second-oldest independent hotel in London.

The London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square on the corner of Grosvenor Square and Duke Street was the first Marriott Hotel in Britain. It opened as the Europa Hotel in 1961 and was bought by Marriott in 1985. It was a popular place for visitors to the American Embassy.

The Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane is on the former site of Grosvenor House, the home of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (who later became the 1st Marquess of Westminster). It was built by Arthur Octavius Edwards in the 1920s and has over 450 bedrooms, with 150 luxury flats in the south wing. It was the first London hotel to have a swimming pool.

The Dorchester is named after Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester. The first building here was erected by Joseph Damer in 1751, and renamed Dorchester House following the Earl&#x27;s succession in 1792. The property was purchased by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and Gordon Hotels Ltd in 1928 to be converted into a hotel, which opened on 18 April 1931. It was General Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s London headquarters in the Second World War. The Duke of Edinburgh held his stag night at the hotel prior to his marriage to Princess Elizabeth.

The May Fair Hotel opened in 1927 on the site of Devonshire House in Stratton Street. It also accommodates the May Fair Theatre, which opened in 1963.

The Ritz opened on Piccadilly on 24 May 1906. It was the first steel-framed building to be constructed in London, and it is one of the most prestigious and best-known hotels in the world.

===Retail===
Mayfair has had a range of exclusive shops, hotels, restaurants and clubs since the 19th century. The district—especially the vicinity of Bond Street—is also the home of numerous commercial art galleries and international auction houses such as Bonhams, Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s.

From the early 19th century, tailors, attracted by the affluent and influential residents, began to take up premises on Savile Row in south-eastern Mayfair, beginning in 1803. The earliest extant tailor to move to Savile Row was Henry Poole &amp; Co in 1846. The street&#x27;s reputation steadily grew throughout the late 19th and early-20th centuries, under the patronage of monarchs, moguls and movie stars, into the global home of men&#x27;s tailoring; a reputation retained to the present day.

Gunter&#x27;s Tea Shop was established in 1757 at Nos. 7–8 Berkeley Square by the Italian Domenico Negri. Robert Gunter took co-ownership of the shop in 1777, and full ownership in 1799. During the 19th century it became a fashionable place to buy cakes and ice cream, and was well-known for its range of multi-tiered wedding cakes. The shop moved to Curzon Street in 1936 when the eastern side of Berkeley Square was demolished, until closing in 1956. The business as a whole survived until the late 1970s.

Mount Street has been a popular shopping street since Mayfair was developed in the 18th century. It was largely rebuilt between 1880 and 1900 under the direction of the 1st Duke of Westminster, when the nearby workhouse was relocated to Pimlico. It now houses a number of shops dealing with luxury trades.

Shepherd Market has been called the &quot;village centre&quot; of Mayfair. The current buildings date from around 1860, and house food and antique shops, pubs and restaurants. The market had a reputation for high-class prostitution. In the 1980s, Jeffrey Archer was alleged to frequent the area and was accused of visiting Monica Coghlan, a call girl in Shepherd Market, which eventually led to a libel trial and his imprisonment for perverting the course of justice.

Alongside Burlington House is one of London&#x27;s most luxurious shopping areas, the Burlington Arcade. It was designed by Samuel Ware for George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington, in 1819. The arcade was designed with tall walls on either side to prevent passers-by throwing litter into the Earl&#x27;s garden. Ownership of the arcade passed to the Chesham family. In 1911, another storey was added by Beresford Pite, who also added the Chesham arms. The family sold the arcade to the Prudential Assurance Company for £333,000 (now £) in 1926. It was bombed during the Second World War and subsequently restored.

 Allens of Mayfair, one of the best-known butchers in London, was founded in a shop on Mount Street in 1830. It held a Royal warrant of appointment to supply meat to the Queen, as well as supplying several high-profile restaurants. After accruing spiralling debts, it was sold to Rare Butchers of Distinction in 2006. The Mayfair premises closed in 2015, but the company retains an online presence.

Scott&#x27;s restaurant moved from Coventry Street to Nos. 20–22 Mount Street in 1967. In 1975, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombed the restaurant twice, killing one and injuring 15 people.

South Audley Street is a major shopping street in Mayfair running from north to south from Grosvenor Square to Curzon Street. Originally a residential street, it was redeveloped between 1875 and 1900. Retailers include china and silverware specialists Thomas Goode and gunsmiths James Purdey &amp; Sons.
===Museums and galleries===
Numerous galleries have given Mayfair a reputation as an international art hub. The Royal Academy of Arts, based in Burlington House, was founded in 1768 by George III and is the oldest fine arts society in the world. Its founding president was Sir Joshua Reynolds. The academy holds classes and exhibitions, and students have included John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. It moved from Somerset House to Trafalgar Square in 1837, sharing with the National Gallery, before moving to Burlington House in 1868. The academy hosts an annual Summer Exhibition, showing over 1,000 contemporary works of art that can be submitted by anyone.

The Fine Art Society gallery was established at No. 148 New Bond Street in 1876. Other galleries in Mayfair include the Maddox Gallery on Maddox Street, and the Halcyon Gallery.
The Handel House Museum at No. 25 Brook Street opened in 2001. George Frideric Handel was the first resident from 1723 until his death in 1759. Most of his major works, including &quot;Messiah&quot;, and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; were composed here. The museum held an exhibition of Jimi Hendrix, who lived in an upper-floor flat in neighbouring No. 23 Brook Street in 1968–69.

The Faraday Museum in Albemarle Street occupies a basement laboratory used by Michael Faraday for his experiments with electromagnetic rotation and motors at the Royal Institution. It opened in 1973 and exhibits include the first electric generator designed by Faraday, along with various notes and medals.

===Business===
Cadbury&#x27;s head office was formerly at No. 25 Berkeley Square in Mayfair. In 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced that it was moving to Uxbridge in order to cut costs.

===Other===
Bourdon House, one of the oldest properties in Mayfair, was constructed by Thomas Barlow between 1723 and 1725 as part of the original development. An additional storey was added around 1864–65. In 1909, the 2nd Duke of Westminster ordered major refurbishments and the expansion of a three-storey wing. He moved out of Grosvenor House in 1916 into this, where he stayed until his death in 1953.

Crewe House was built in the late 18th century on the site of a house on Curzon Street owned by Edward Shepherd, a key builder and architect around Mayfair. It was bought by James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe in 1818 and became known as Wharncliffe House. In 1899, it was purchased by Robert Crewe-Milnes, Earl Crewe, giving it its current name. The house is part of the Saudi Arabian Embassy.

Mayfair has many blue plaques on buildings for its prominent residents. Standing at the corner of Chesterfield Street and Charles Street, one can see plaques for William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (later King William IV), Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, the writer Somerset Maugham and Regency-era fashion icon Beau Brummell.

==Transport==
While there are no London Underground stations inside Mayfair, there are several on the boundaries. The Central Line stops at Marble Arch, Bond Street and Oxford Circus along Oxford Street along the northern edge, and Piccadilly Circus and Green Park are along the Piccadilly line on the southern side, along with Hyde Park Corner close by in Knightsbridge.

Down Street tube station opened in 1907 as &quot;Down Street (Mayfair)&quot;. It closed in 1932 but was used during the Second World War by the Emergency Railway Committee, and briefly by Churchill and the war cabinet while waiting for the War Rooms to be ready. While there is only one bus route in Mayfair itself, the 24-hour route C2, there are many bus routes along the perimeter roads.

==Cultural references==

Mayfair (spelled &quot;May Fair&quot;) is the home of Sir Brian in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Newcomes&quot;, and otherwise features as the most desirable part of London.
Mayfair is the principal location of the television series Bridgerton.

Mayfair has featured in a number of novels, including Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1934) and P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1949). It is a partial setting for Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1811) and Michael Arlen&#x27;s &quot;The Green Hat&quot; (1924). Oscar Wilde lived in Grosvenor Square between 1883 and 1884, and referred to it in his works. He regularly socialised in the artistic quarter along Half Moon Street, which is mentioned in both &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

Mayfair is the most expensive property on the standard British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board at £400, and is part of the dark blue set with Park Lane. It commands the highest rents of all properties; landing on Mayfair with a hotel costs £2,000. The price is a reference to the property values in the area, which have remained consistently high, with real-life rent as much as £36,000 per week. At the time the board was being designed in the 1930s, Mayfair still had a significant upper-class residential population.

The department store Debenhams became one of the first companies in Britain to have a dedicated business telephone number, Mayfair 1, in 1903.

<text>Mill Hill is a suburb in the London Borough of Barnet, England. It is situated around northwest of Charing Cross, close to the Hertfordshire border. It was in the historic county of Middlesex until 1965, when it became part of Greater London. Its population was 18,451 in 2011.

It consists of the original Mill Hill Village; the later-developed Mill Hill Broadway (now the area&#x27;s main hub); and Mill Hill East, alongside large swathes of countryside. A further area at the western edge of the suburb, The Hale, is on the borders of Mill Hill and Edgware, and is partly in each.

==History==
The area&#x27;s name was first recorded as Myllehill in 1547 and appears to mean &quot;hill with a windmill&quot;. However, the workings of the original Mill are in the building adjacent to The Mill Field.
Mill Hill Village is the oldest known inhabited part of the district, a ribbon development along a medieval route called &#x27;The Ridgeway&#x27;. It is thought that the name &#x27;Mill Hill&#x27; may be derived from a mill on The Ridgeway, built on an area of open ground (now a park) known as The Mill Field. The village is bounded on the north and the south by Green Belt land, and its High Street, at 100 yards, is the shortest in London.

The area&#x27;s proximity to the city made it popular as a country retreat from the 17th century onwards, and large houses and quaint cottages survive. William Wilberforce (MP, and abolitionist of the slave trade) and Sir Stamford Raffles (founder of colonial Singapore) both briefly resided here, the former being the patron of Mill Hill&#x27;s first church, Saint Paul&#x27;s. As late as 1960, five shops existed in the Village (Griffin&#x27;s sub-Post Office, The Blenheim Steps, Cook &amp; Son (sweets and groceries), Hawes Brothers (grocers) and Vincett&#x27;s (butchers)) but although the buildings survive, they have all since been converted into private houses, as the retail focus in the area shifted to Mill Hill Broadway.

===Military===
Inglis Barracks at Mill Hill East was home to the Middlesex Regiment between 1905 and 1966. The 1941 reopening of the railway station, under wartime conditions, was to allow easy access to the barracks.

Situated along Partingdale Lane is Seafield House. Now converted into a private home, it was originally designed and operated as a secret nuclear bunker to house and protect the &#x27;London North Group&#x27; emergency regional government between about 1951 and 1985.

==Governance==
Mill Hill was part of the ancient civil parish of Hendon within the historic county boundaries of Middlesex. Mill Hill as part of Municipal Borough of Hendon was merged into the London Borough of Barnet in Greater London in 1965. Mill Hill is one of 21 electoral wards in the borough. This ward has 3 out of the 63 seats on the Barnet Council.

Mill Hill was in the parliamentary constituency of Hendon which was created in 1918. This lasted until 1945 when the constituency was split in two, Mill Hill in Hendon North. In 1997, the Hendon constituency was recreated. From then, until he lost his seat to the Conservative candidate, Matthew Offord, at the 2010 general election, Hendon was represented in the House of Commons by Andrew Dismore of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
Mill Hill&#x27;s postal address is London NW7 (which also covers Highwood Hill and part of Arkley).

===Mill Hill Village===

The village is a ribbon development along The Ridgeway. It has green belt in either side.

&quot;Partingdale&quot; and &quot;Burtonhole&quot; form a valley north of The Ridgeway. North is Folly Farm and Folly Brook, a tributary of the Dollis Brook, running west to east. Between The Ridgeway and Folly Brook are Burtonhole Farm, a garden centre called Finchley Nurseries, and several sports grounds.

The National Institute for Medical Research, a landmark building, was demolished in 2018 and the site is being developed for new houses and apartments. On 1 April 2015, the NIMR became part of the new Francis Crick Institute and ceased to exist as a separate MRC institute. The site was fully vacated and closed for redevelopment in 2017.

Arrandene Open Space and Featherstone Hill is a large open space which is bordered by Wise Lane, Wills Grove, Milespit Hill and The Ridgeway. While there are many open spaces in the area, Arrandene is unique because of its many open fields, meadows and woodland. The open fields were originally hay meadows which provided feed for the horses pulling carriages north to Barnet and beyond.

On Milespit Hill is the non-denominational Mill Hill Cemetery, formerly known as &quot;Paddington New Cemetery&quot;. The 1960s pop singer Billy Fury (Ronald Wycherley, 1940–83) is buried there. The cemetery also has two Commonwealth War Graves Commission sections of Second World War graves. One has the graves of 53 United Kingdom personnel, and has a Cross of Sacrifice. The other has the graves of 254 Dutch personnel, 212 of whom were merchant navy. Many were originally buried elsewhere in the UK, but were reburied here as a Dutch &quot;Field of Honour&quot;.

Southwest of Mill Hill Village is a small suburb called &quot;Poets&#x27; Corner&quot;, and to the north an old estate, now a nature reserve, Moat Mount Open Space.
===Mill Hill Broadway===
The modern-day centre of Mill Hill is at Mill Hill Broadway, previously known as Lawrence Street. This is a suburban district which developed from the 1890s onwards, and especially in the early part of the 20th century, after the arrival of the Midland Railway station in 1868. The Broadway itself is now an important local retail area with numerous shops and cafes and transport links.

===Mill Hill East===

Parts of the east side of Mill Hill have been redeveloped, with the former gas works replaced by a Waitrose supermarket and housing developments. The small local retail area at Mill Hill East is at &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Corner&quot; (officially Holders Hill Circus) east of the station. South of Mill Hill East are Copthall and Holders Hill.

The United Kingdom / Carl Zeiss / Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Works was established at the top of Bittacy Hill in 1912 and demolished about 1990, to be replaced by a large building owned by the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, to complement their nearby Watchtower House built on the site of the former Bittacy House.

===Neighbouring areas===
==Demography==
Mill Hill electoral ward of Barnet has a population of 18,451 as of the 2011 UK Census. The census also showed that ethnically, 64% of the population is White (49% White British, 13% Other White, 2% Irish). The largest minorities were the 7% identifying themselves as Indian, 6% as Other Asian, and 6% as Black African. On religion, 39% identified as Christian, 19% Jewish, 14% no religion, 12% Muslim, 5% Hindu, 2% other religion and 8% religion not stated. The most spoken foreign language was Persian. The majority of the 6,875 households are tenure owned. The vast majority (4,602) of the properties are in the &quot;whole house or bungalow&quot; category, of which most are semi-detached. 4.1% of economically active people were unemployed. The median age was 35.

==Transport==
===Tube and rail===
Stations in the area are:

* (Thameslink (route))
*Mill Hill East (Northern line)

There was also another smaller station, , opened by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway in 1867. Passenger services ended in 1939, and freight traffic in 1964.

The branch was opened in 1867 as part of the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway, which also built Dollis Brook Viaduct east of the station. It uesd to continue west to Edgware and east to the Great Northern main line at Finsbury Park station, following the present Northern line route as far as Highgate. 

In 1935, as part of the London Transport New Works Programme, plans were announced to modernise and electrify the railway and transfer it to the London Underground. Work was started, and steam passenger services between Edgware and Finchley Central were withdrawn in September 1939 to facilitate it. However, the Second World War soon caused the project to be cut short. The Finchley Central – Mill Hill East section had wartime priority (due to the Inglis Barracks) and was completed in 1941,
but the plans to complete the modernisation and restart passenger services to Edgware were never resumed and were abandoned in 1950. 

Steam freight trains continued to run between Finchley and Edgware until 1964; the track beyond Mill Hill East was lifted the following year. Although partly built over, including by the M1 motorway, most of the old track bed has become a footpath, and decaying 1930s concrete infrastructure, never used, can still be seen. 

===Buses===

London Buses routes serving Mill Hill are 113, 114, 186, 221, 240, 251, 292, 302, 303, 305, 382, 605, 614, 628, 644, 688 and N113.

===Road===

The A1 and A41 converge as they enter Mill Hill at Fiveways Corner, this section is known as the Watford Way. The dual carriageway passes through Mill Hill, and the routes diverge at Apex Corner (officially Northway Circus). The M1 motorway was built through the western part of Mill Hill in 1967. There is a disused southbound exit slip road which passes under the Watford Way and which covers part of the old railway between Mill Hill East and Edgware Town.

==Development==

Mill Hill East has been designated by the Mayor of London in his London Plan as a &#x27;proposed area of intensification&#x27;, in and around the Inglis Barracks site. As a result, Barnet Council designated the &#x27;Mill Hill East Area Action Plan&#x27; (AAP) and carried out public consultation events. An at-times noisy &#x27;examination in public&#x27;, to test the &#x27;soundness&#x27; of the council&#x27;s submitted AAP proposals, was held in October 2008, conducted by the Planning Inspectorate, and the subsequent report broadly agreed with the council&#x27;s plans.

Representations were made to the Planning Inspectorate to reopen the railway line from Mill Hill East station to the west.

A small victory for local protesters was that the report reaffirmed that a local closed road, Sanders Lane, would not be reopened for traffic, if only because the road was outside the AAP boundary (this had already conceded by the council) and would need separate consideration. The inspector stated in his report of December 2008:

The amended AAP was formally adopted by the council on 27 January 2009.

==Invention and discovery==
In 1749 the botanist Peter Collinson inherited an estate which is now part of Mill Hill School, here he created a botanical garden. The lexicographer James Murray started work on the first Oxford English Dictionary in 1879, whilst teaching at Mill Hill School. He had a building built in the school grounds to house the quotation slips and his small editorial staff. Murray called this building his scriptorium, when the project moved to Oxford the building was used by the school as a reading room.

In the Second World War the Maudsley Hospital moved to the evacuated Mill Hill School as the Mill Hill Emergency Hospital. Here John C. Raven developed a verbal intelligence test called the Mill Hill Vocabulary scale.

University of London Observatory is a teaching astronomical observatory which is part of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London. It is situated on the A41 Watford Way, southeast of The Broadway. The Observatory was opened on 8 October 1929 by the Astronomer Royal Frank Watson Dyson. In 2009, student astronomers at the observatory tracked the extrasolar planet HD 80606 b and for the first time accurately calculated its size.

The National Institute for Medical Research was a large medical research facility situated on the Ridgeway. Researchers at the Institute have, amongst other achievements, developed liquid and gas chromatography, discovered interferon and also discovered the sex determining gene SRY. In 2018 the Medical Research building was demolished to make way for new homes.

==Religious sites==
There are several religious institutions along the Ridgeway, including:

* The Missionary Institute (which was present on the Ridgeway until 2007)
* Holcombe House (part of the institute)
* the motherhouse of the British Province of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul
* until 2007, Saint Joseph&#x27;s College, a large seminary.
* The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have had a centre since 1958, and they redeveloped the Carl Zeiss optical works to become the International Bible Students&#x27; Association in 1988.
* The Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, an African church next to the Village Pond at the junction of Milespit Hill, High Street and The Ridgeway, occupying the former Methodist Church.
* Mill Hill Synagogue is located near Mill Hill Broadway station. The Synagogue joined the United Synagogue as an affiliated synagogue in 1950.
* John Keble Church, Mill Hill

==Public services==

Veolia Water Central Limited formerly Three Valleys Water supplies Mill Hill&#x27;s water. EDF Energy Networks is the Distribution network operator licensed to distribute electricity from the transmission grid to homes and businesses in Mill Hill. On Partingdale Lane there is a large electrical station, built in 1961. The station is served by very high-voltage cables underground along Totteridge Valley. The proposed above-ground pylons and cables were rejected after a high-profile residents&#x27; campaign.

British Gas had a large gasworks at Mill Hill East with two gasometers, now replaced with housing and shops including a Waitrose supermarket.

==Parks and recreation==
In 1923 Hendon Urban District Council brought part of Daws Farm thought to be named after Thomas Daws and turned it into Mill Hill Park. This was then transferred to Barnet Council in 1965 which now manages the park. In the park there are football pitches, cricket pitch, tennis courts, basketball court, a children&#x27;s play area, outdoor gym, cafe and toilet block. The same building also houses Mill Hill Bowls Club with two pitches.

Arrandene Open Space is a green space that sits next to Mill Hill Park separated by Wise Lane.

<text>Mitcham is an area within the London Borough of Merton in South London, England. It is centred southwest of Charing Cross. Originally a village in the county of Surrey, today it is mainly a residential suburb, and includes Mitcham Common. It has been a settlement throughout recorded history.

== Location ==
Mitcham is in the east of the London Borough of Merton, bounded by boroughs of Wandsworth, Croydon, Lambeth and Sutton. The River Wandle bounds the town to the southwest. The original village lies in the west. Mitcham Common takes up the greater part of the boundary and the area to the south part of the CR4 postcode is in the area of Pollards Hill. Some of the area which includes Mitcham Common and parts of Mitcham Junction are in the CR0 postcode area.

== History ==
The toponym &quot;Mitcham&quot; is Old English in origin and means &quot;big settlement&quot;. Before the Romans and Saxons were present, it was a Celtic settlement, with evidence of a hill fort in the Pollards Hill area. The discovery of Roman-era graves and a well on the site of the Mitcham gasplant evince Roman settlement. The Anglo-Saxon graveyard on the north bank of the Wandle is the largest discovered to date, and many of the finds therein are on display in the British Museum. Scholars such as Myres have suggested that Mitcham and other Thames plain settlements were some of the first populated by the Anglo-Saxons.

What became the parish lands could have hosted the Battle of Merton, 871, in which King Ethelred of Wessex was either mortally wounded or killed outright. The Church of England parish church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the early Kingdom of England. Mostly rebuilt in 1819–1821, the current building retains the original Saxon tower. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists Mitcham as a small farming community, an implied estimate of 250 people, living in two hamlets: Mitcham, the area today being Upper Mitcham; and Whitford (Lower Green).

The Domesday Book records Mitcham as &quot;Michelham&quot;. It was held partly by the Canons of Bayeux, partly by William, son of Ansculf and partly by Osbert. Its domesday assets were: 8 hides and 1 virgate. It had ½ mill worth £1, 3½ ploughs, of meadow. It rendered £4 5s 4d, at a time when a pound sterling still implied something similar to a pound of silver. The area lay in the Anglo-Saxon county subdivision of Wallington hundred.

During her reign Queen Elizabeth I made at least five visits to the area. John Donne and Sir Walter Raleigh also had residences here in this era. It was at this time that Mitcham became gentrified, as due to the abundance of lavender fields Mitcham became renowned for its soothing air. The air also led people to settle in the area during times of plague.

When industrialisation occurred, Mitcham quickly grew to become a town and most of the farms were swallowed up in the expansion. Remnants of this farming history today include: Mitcham Common itself; Arthur&#x27;s Pond on the corner of Watney&#x27;s Road and Commonside East, and named for a local farmer; Alfred Mizen School (Garden Primary School), named after a local nurseryman charitable towards the burgeoning town; and the road New Barnes Avenue, replacing part of New Barn(e)s Farm.
Many lavender fields were in Mitcham, and peppermint and lavender oils were also distilled. In 1749 two local physic gardeners, John Potter and William Moore, founded a company to make and market toiletries made from locally grown herbs and flowers. Lavender features on Merton Council&#x27;s coat of arms and the badge of the local football team, Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C., as well as in the name of a local council ward, Lavender Field.

Mitcham was industrialised first along the banks of the Wandle, where snuff, copper, flour, iron and dye were all worked. Mitcham, along with nearby Merton Abbey, became the calico cloth printing centres of England by 1750. Asprey, suppliers of luxury goods made from various materials, was founded in Mitcham as a silk-printing business in 1781. William Morris opened a factory on the River Wandle at Merton Abbey. Merton Abbey Mills were the Liberty silk-printing works. It is now a craft village and its waterwheel has been preserved.

Activity along the Wandle led to the building of the Surrey Iron Railway, the world&#x27;s first public railway, in 1803. The decline and failure of the railway in the 1840s also heralded a change in industry, as horticulture gradually gave way to manufacturing, with paint, varnish, linoleum and firework manufacturers moving into the area. The work provided and migratory patterns eventually resulted in a doubling of the population between the years 1900 and 1910.

In 1829 Miss Mary Tate donated land and money to build almshouses on the site of the former Tate family home in Cricket Green. The buildings were designed in a Tudor style by John Butcher and established to accommodate twelve poor widows or spinsters of the parish. Miss Tate was the only surviving member of the Tate family, who had lived from about 1700 in a large mansion on the site of the almshouses. The gardens at the rear of the property were originally provided for the use of residents, but later informally rented out as allotments.

Mitcham became a borough, within a two-tier council system, on 19 September 1934 with the charter of incorporation being presented to the 84-year-old mayor, R.M. Chart, by the Lord Lieutenant of Surrey, Lord Ashcombe.
Social housing schemes in the 1930s included New Close, aimed at housing people made homeless by a factory explosion in 1933 and Sunshine Way, for housing the poor from inner London. This industry made Mitcham a target for German bombing during World War II. During this time Mitcham also returned to its agricultural roots, with Mitcham Common being farmed to help with the war effort.

From 1929 the electronics company Mullard had a factory on New Road.

Postwar, the areas of Eastfields, Phipps Bridge and Pollards Hill were rebuilt to provide cheaper more affordable housing. The largest council housing project in Mitcham is Phipps Bridge Estate. Further expansion of the housing estates in Eastfields, Phipps Bridge and Pollards Hill occurred after 1965. In Mitcham Cricket Green, the area lays reasonable, although not definitive, claim to having the world&#x27;s oldest cricket ground in continual use, and the world&#x27;s oldest club in Mitcham Cricket Club.

The ground is also notable for having a road separate the pavilion from the pitch. Local folklore claims Mitcham has the oldest fair in England, believing it to have been granted a charter by Queen Elizabeth I, a claim never proven.

;Literature
Nimrod, sporting writer of the early 19th century, advocated against the grazing on grass of racehorses. He finds a very fast donkey chaise, investigates the donkey&#x27;s owner and finds it is a Mitcham blacksmith, who never turns out the donkey in summer onto Mitcham Common but keeps it fed with oats and beans as if a hunter racing horse.

Mitcham appears in local variants of mildly vulgar rhymes of 18th and 19th centuries, all beginning with:
:&quot;Sutton for good mutton&quot;

One variant ends with &quot;Mitcham for a thief&quot;, another &quot;Ewell&quot; which is opposite in direction. An author noted for another genre, James Edward Preston Muddock as Dick Donovan penned &quot;The Naughty Maid of Mitcham&quot; in 1910.

== Open spaces ==
Mitcham is home to a large area (460 acres) of South London&#x27;s open green space in the form of Mitcham Common, studded with a few ponds and buildings.

The buildings comprising the Windmill Trading Estate have existed in one form or another since 1782. The Mill House Ecology Centre and the Harvester (formerly the Mill House Pub) are located near the site of an old windmill, the remnants of which still exist.

The Seven Islands pond is the largest of all the ponds, created following gravel extraction of the 19th century. The most recent, Bidder&#x27;s pond, was created in 1990 and named after George Parker Bidder.

== Notable buildings ==


*The Canons. House originally built in 1680; it was the home of the family Cranmer until it was sold to the local council in 1939. The name originates from an Augustinian priory that was given this site in the 12th Century. The pond next to which it is located and the dovecote (dated at 1511) both predate the house.
*Eagle House, built in 1705. Eagle House is a Queen Anne house built in the Dutch style on land formerly owned by Sir Walter Raleigh. It is on London Road, Mitcham, the grounds forming a triangle bounded by London Road, Bond Road and Western Road. The building was commissioned by the doctor Fernando Mendes (1647–1724), former physician to King Charles II.
*Mitcham Common Windmill, a post mill dating from 1806.
*Old Mitcham Station, on the Surrey Iron Railway route. Now called Station Court, the building was a former merchant&#x27;s home and is possibly the oldest station in the world.
*The Tate Almshouses, built in 1829 to provide for the poor by Mary Tate.
*The Watermead Fishing Cottages.
*Mitcham Vestry Hall, the annex of which now houses the Wandle Industrial Museum.
*Mitcham Public Library, built in 1933.
*Elm Lodge, 1808. This listed Regency house was occupied by Dr. Parrott, a village doctor, in the early 19th century, and for a short time by the artist, Sir William Nicholson. The curved canopy over the entrance door is a typical feature of this period.
*Mitcham Court. The centre portion, first known as Elm Court, was built in 1840, the wings later. Caesar Czarnikow, a sugar merchant, lived here ca. 1865–86 and presented the village with a new horse-drawn fire engine. Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, M.P., conveyed the house to the borough in the mid-1930s. The Ionic columned porch and the ironwork on the ground floor windows are notable features.
* Renshaw&#x27;s factory, a marzipan factory, founded in 1898 in the City and thus one of the earliest in the country, which came to Mitcham in 1924. It was on Locks Lane until 1991, when the company moved its operations to Liverpool. The factory was featured in three 1950s British Pathé News shorts. The building has lent its name to the area where it stood, Renshaw Corner.
*Poulters Park, Home to Mitcham Rugby Union Football Club
*Imperial Fields, Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C.&#x27;s home ground.
*Mitcham Methodist Church was designed by the architect Edward Mills (1915–1998), and built in 1958–9. Regarded as the best surviving work by the most successful Nonconformist architect of the period. A radical and inspiring building that was forwarded by the 20th Century Society for listing as it was under threat. Grade II listed on 5 March 2010.
*St Barnabas church, Gorringe Park Avenue, Mitcham. Built in the gothic style, on 17 May 1913 the foundation stone of the church building was laid, and on 14 November 1914 the church was consecrated – by the bishop of Southwark. The architect was HP Burke-Downing. The building is still in use as an Anglican church. Both the church itself and the adjacent parish hall are Grade II listed.
*The White House, Mitcham on which the wall plaque says: &quot;This 18th Century house was renovated in the Regency style in 1826 by Dr. A.C. Bartley, a village doctor, whose daughter wrote reminiscences of old Mitcham. The house remained in his family until 1919. Fluted Greek Doric columns support a slightly altered porch with a bowed front.&quot; It is Grade II listed.
*The Burn Bullock, a public house, London Road, Mitcham is a three-storey Grade II listed building originally called the King&#x27;s Head Hotel. The front of the building dates from the 18th century whilst its wing dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. It is named after Burnett Bullock, a well known, former cricket player from the locality.
*The White Hart public house is Mitcham&#x27;s earliest recorded inn, rebuilt in 1749–50 after serious fire damage. The central porch, with frieze and balustrade, is supported by four Tuscan columns. Stagecoaches used to start from a yard at the rear. It is Grade II listed. It is located in London Road, opposite Cricket Green.

<text>Morden is a district and town in South London, England, now within the London Borough of Merton, in the ceremonial county of Greater London. It adjoins Merton Park and Wimbledon to the north, Mitcham to the east, Sutton to the south and Worcester Park to the west, and is around south-southwest of Charing Cross. Prior to the creation of Greater London in 1965, for local government purposes, Morden was in the administrative and historic county of Surrey.

At the 2011 census, Morden had a population of 48,233, including the wards of Cannon Hill, Lower Morden, Merton Park, Ravensbury and St Helier.

Morden Hall Park, a National Trust park on the banks of the River Wandle adjacent to the town centre, is a key feature of the area.

== Origin of name ==
Morden&#x27;s name may be derived from the Common Brittonic words &quot;Mawr&quot; (great or large) and &quot;Dun&quot; (fort), or possibly &quot;The Town on the Moor&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Human activity in Morden dates back to the Iron Age period when Celtic tribes are known to have occupied areas around Wimbledon, but the first significant development in Morden was the construction of the Roman road called Stane Street from Chichester to London.

The route of Stane Street through Morden followed the current A24, London Road up Stonecot Hill from the south west crossing Morden Park to the west of the current dual carriageway road and passing through the pitch and putt golf course and the grounds of St Lawrence&#x27;s Church. The road then descended the other side of the hill towards the town centre passing west of the Underground station and crossing the north corner of Morden Hall Park heading in the direction of Colliers Wood and Tooting. Small Roman artifacts, mainly coins and pottery, have been found at various locations within the area although there is no evidence of any settlement.

Ethelstan the Etheling, son of Ethelred the Unready, left &quot;land at Mordune&quot; to the abbey of Christ and St. Peter in his will of 1015, which became the site of the first Saxon parish church of St Lawrence.

In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded the manor as &quot;Mordone&quot;, part of Wallington Hundred. It was held by Westminster Abbey and its assets were: 3 hides; 1 mill worth £2 and 7 ploughs. It rendered £15 in total. Fourteen people were recorded as living in the area.

=== The Garth family ===

The manor and village remained abbey property until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in Henry VIII&#x27;s reign when the manor was sold to Lionel Ducket and Edward Whitchurch. Together, they sold it on the following year to Sir Richard Garth who became Lord of the Manor. The Garth family owned the land and maintained their connection with the parish for the next four centuries, living at Morden Hall Park until the manor was sold by another Sir Richard Garth in 1872.

The prominence of the Garth family is recorded locally in the name of Garth Road, Lower Morden and the former Garth School. The two lions included in the present civic arms of the London Borough of Merton are adopted from the arms of Sir Richard.

=== 19th century ===
Despite the rapid suburban development of nearby Wimbledon occasioned by the arrival of the new railways constructed in the mid 19th century, Morden remained a rural parish throughout the 19th century. While the population of Wimbledon grew hugely from 1,591 in 1801 to 41,652 in 1901, the population of Morden was 512 in 1801 and, one hundred years later, had grown to just 960.

In 1871, the area of the parish of Morden was with the small village clustered around St Lawrence&#x27;s church at the top of the hill on the road from London to Epsom (now London Road/Epsom Road). Approximately to the west of the main village and the grounds of Morden Park stood the hamlet of Lower Morden.

Close to the church were the George Inn, a 17th-century coaching inn (now modernised and part of a national pub restaurant chain), the estate of Morden Park and a school.

The other main public house in the village was the Crown Inn, located to the north east of the village with a small cluster of cottages on Crown Road. The rest of what is now the commercial centre of Morden was fields.

In the late 19th century the principal industry remained agriculture, although some industrial activity did exist along the River Wandle where watermills ground tobacco to snuff and a varnish works existed close to the site of Poplar Primary School. By 1898, the varnish works had gone and there was a brickworks on the site of Mostyn Gardens in Martin Way (then called Green Lane).

===20th century===
Under the Local Government Act, 1894, the parish of Morden formed part of the Croydon Rural District of Surrey. The first two decades of the 20th century saw little change in the village, with industry still mainly agricultural in nature; however, development in the parish of Merton to the north led to that area being removed from the rural district to form the Merton Urban District in 1907. Morden was merged with the Merton Urban District in 1913 to form the Merton and Morden Urban District. It was not until 1926, when Morden Underground station opened as the terminus of a new extension (from Clapham Common) of the City &amp; South London Railway (now part of the London Underground&#x27;s Northern Line), that the fast and direct route to Central London opened up the village for residential development.

To complement the new tube station, a garage was constructed on the other side of London Road, adjacent to the railway cutting and, in 1932, Morden Cinema was built next to it on the corner of Aberconway Road. Around the station, which, itself, had several shops built into the building, a new adjacent commercial centre grew quickly as shops sprang up along London Road and Crown Lane, including a rebuilt and enlarged Crown Inn public house (opened in 1932) and a large Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS) department store (opened in 1940).

Away from the new commercial centre of Morden, the existing rural roads were widened and rebuilt and the fields were rapidly divided into building plots and laid out for new housing. Further transport improvements came with the construction of a new Southern Railway branch line from Wimbledon to Sutton via stations at South Merton and Morden South (so named to differentiate it from Morden Underground Station and Morden Road (now Morden Road tram stop), although it was actually North-East of the original village centre). The new line opened between January 1930 and 1933. As a result of the new train and bus links, the population of Morden increased rapidly, from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931. In the next fifteen years, the population continued to grow, as most of the parish was covered in new suburban homes.

One of the main residential developments in the 1930s was the St. Helier Estate, built by the London County Council (LCC) to house workers from Inner London and named in honour of Lady St. Helier, an alderman of the LCC. The estate was, at the time, the largest local authority development in South London and has its road names arranged in alphabetical order, from the North-West corner (Abbotsbury Road) to the South-East corner (Woburn Road). Reflecting the previous ownership of the land by Westminster Abbey, all are named after religious establishments.
In 1943, the council was granted a civic coat-of-arms incorporating lions from the Garth family arms and the fret from the arms of Merton Priory. The motto, &quot;In Libertate Vis&quot;, means &quot;Our Strength is our Freedom&quot;. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the Merton and Morden Urban District Council was abolished and its area combined with that of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon and the Municipal Borough of Mitcham to form the present-day London Borough of Merton. It then became part of London and not Surrey any more.

===Today===
Despite London&#x27;s suburban expansion, a little of the earlier rural nature of Morden has survived; for instance several grand period buildings remain, especially within Morden&#x27;s parks. The area retains a good provision of parks and green spaces, many of them created from former country estates. The Morden Hall Park is of particular note and is run by the National Trust (see below). Its main entrance is only from Morden Underground Station.

The largest building in the town centre is Crown House, sixties-built and 14 storeys tall; designed in 1959 by A. Green ARIBA and built between 1960 and 1962. The concaved frontage of the building lends it some distinction, as does the &quot;chessboard&quot; style juxtaposition of its light and dark facade features. It incorporated The Crown public house, on which site part of the building covered. The building is home to Merton Civic Centre and a large adjoining library.

At around the same time, Morden Underground Station, originally a single storey building, with shops, had three-storey office accommodation incorporated above it.

A further office building with a large supermarket (now a Sainsbury&#x27;s) at ground-floor level, was built in the 1980s in the centre of the town shopping centre.. This replaced an equally large building housing the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society.

The cinema and adjoining garage were demolished and replaced by shops some years ago.

==Landmarks==

Morden plays host to a number of buildings and parks worthy of note including:
*The Bait&#x27;ul Futuh Mosque, the largest mosque in Western Europe, built by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Completed in 2003 at a cost of approximately £5.5 million, the mosque covers an area of and the full complex can accommodate up to 10,000 worshippers. It is located next to Morden South railway station and approximately 700 yards from Morden Underground station.
*Morden Hall Park is a key feature of the Morden area with large, period buildings located within its boundaries. It is a National Trust park, and is located on the banks of the River Wandle, near the town centre and few hundred yards from Morden Underground station. It covers over of parkland with the River Wandle meandering through it spanned by numerous foot-bridges. The estate contains a number of historic buildings including Morden Hall itself, Morden Cottage, an old Snuff Mill, and many old farm buildings, some of which are now a garden centre and a city farm. The rose garden has over 2000 roses. The estate land was originally owned by Westminster Abbey. There is evidence of an earlier manor-house, but Morden Hall dates back to the 1770s and contains a variety of natural landscapes, including the parkland of the &quot;Deer Park&quot;, meadow and marshland.

*Morden Park, another park containing a period building of note. The park includes land that previously formed the grounds of Morden Park House, a small 18th-century country estate. The Georgian country house was built at the top of the hill in the 1770s for merchant and distiller John Ewart with attached landscaped gardens.

*St Lawrence Church, Morden. St Lawrence Church is the Church of England parish church for Morden. The building is Grade I listed, and located on London Road, at the highest point of Morden, overlooking Morden Park. Located on the Garth family estate, the current church was built in the 1630s in the Protestant style, and replaced an earlier wooden one from the Saxon period.
*Morden Baptist Church, opened in 1935 to replace an earlier (1885) corrugated iron building. The Church stands with the main entrance facing up Crown Lane on the Morden one way system. In 1990 a very substantial building scheme was undertaken to provide the current improved facilities.

<text>Mortlake is a suburban district of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on the south bank of the River Thames between Kew and Barnes. Historically it was part of Surrey and until 1965 was in the Municipal Borough of Barnes. For many centuries it had village status and extended far to the south, to include East Sheen and part of what is now Richmond Park. Its Stuart and Georgian history was economically one of malting, brewing, farming, watermen and the Mortlake Tapestry Works (1617–1704), Britain&#x27;s most important producer. A London landmark, the former Mortlake Brewery or Stag Brewery, is on the edge of Mortlake.

The Waterloo to Reading railway line runs through Mortlake, which has a pedestrianised riverside, two riverside pubs and a village green. The Boat Race finishes at Mortlake every March/April.

==Governance==
The area lies within the Mortlake and Barnes Common ward of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. In the 2018 local elections two Conservatives and one Liberal Democrats were elected to represent the ward, with two Liberal Democrats and one Green elected in 2022. The ward is part of the Richmond Park parliamentary constituency, and the South West constituency in the London Assembly.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Mortlake&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Mortelaga&quot; and &quot;Mortelage&quot;, a name with two possible derivations. If the second element is the Old English &quot;lacu&quot; meaning a stream, then the first element is very likely the fish-name &quot;mort&quot; meaning a young salmon, hence &#x27;salmon stream&#x27;. If the second element is the dialect &quot;lag&quot; meaning a long, narrow marshy meadow, then the name means &#x27;Morta&#x27;s meadow&#x27;.

Mortlake lay in the hundred of Brixton, which faded into obscurity.

According to the Domesday Book, the manor and parish of &quot;Mortlage&quot; was held by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury when its assets were: 25 hides; 1 church, 2 mills worth £5, 1 fishery, 33 ploughs, of meadow, wood worth 55 hogs. It rendered a large £38 plus 4s 4d from 17 houses in London, 2s 3d from houses in Southwark and £1 from tolls at Putney per year to its feudal system overlords. The manor belonged to the Archbishops of Canterbury until the time of Henry VIII, when it passed by exchange to the Crown. From the early part of the 17th century until after the English Civil War, Mortlake was celebrated for the manufacture of tapestry, founded during the reign of James I at the Mortlake Tapestry Works.

Mortlake was reduced by when Richmond Park was created by Charles I in 1637. Other parishes also lost smaller amounts of land to the new deer park.

Colston House&#x27;s forebear was built by Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex then acquired by Edward Colston, major benefactor and investor to the port city of Bristol. This was pulled down in 1860. John Barber, Lord Mayor in 1733, a suspected Jacobite opposed to the &#x27;Georgian&#x27; House of Hanover but Member of Parliament for the City on the strength of his opposition to Walpole&#x27;s protectionist excise scheme, was buried in Mortlake in 1741. He had given land to extend the churchyard. Sir Henry Taylor, KCMG, the dramatic poet, lived in Mortlake in the 19th century.

Sir John Barnard, Lord Mayor of London in the year 1737 and also an MP, used public addresses and private campaigns to outstanding effect in supporting the government against the Jacobite movement in 1745.

Since 1845, the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race has had its finish point at Mortlake, marked by the University Boat Race stone just downstream of Chiswick Bridge. Several other important rowing races over the Championship Course also either start or finish at the stone. The first National School in Mortlake was built providing compulsory education at primary level in 1869, followed by an infants school in 1890 and county level, into secondary level school in 1906. James Chuter Ede taught there in the years leading up to his election to Surrey County Council in 1914, when he became the leading figure in the development of education in Surrey; he eventually became Home Secretary throughout the Attlee administration.

Apart from Archbishops of Canterbury, Mortlake&#x27;s most famous former resident is John Dee (1527–1608/09), mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, alchemist and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I. He lived at Mortlake from 1565 to 1595 except for the six years between 1583 and 1589 when he was travelling in Europe. His house no longer exists but it became the Mortlake Tapestry Works and at the end of the 18th century was a girls&#x27; school.

Sir Christopher Packe (1593?–1682), Lord Mayor of London, lived in Mortlake in about 1655–60.

John Partridge (astrologer) (1644–c.1714) was born at East Sheen and apprenticed to a local shoemaker. He died in Mortlake and is buried there.

Edward Colston, the English merchant, philanthropist and Tory Member of Parliament who was involved in the Atlantic slave trade, lived at (old) Cromwell House (demolished 1857) from about 1689 until his death in 1721. 

The cemetery of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake contains the tomb of the Victorian explorer and orientalist Sir Richard Burton (1821–1890). 

Former British Prime Minister Henry Addington (1757–1844) who, as Lord Sidmouth, was Ranger of Richmond Park, and after whom the park&#x27;s Sidmouth Plantation is named, is buried at St Mary the Virgin Mortlake.

Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), English mathematician and writer, lived in Mortlake when she was 15 years old.

==Economy==
Mortlake is mostly a residential commuter town with a strong history of self-employed trades as it has traditionally centred its commerce on its foreshortened boundary, the Upper Richmond Road, arguably half part of East Sheen. Some businesses on the north side of the Upper Richmond Road make reference to the old ecclesiastical and ward boundaries supported by their still Mortlake side streets. East Sheen was once a manor in the parish of Mortlake and since early times an economic forum, and now a dining and convenience hub of the two districts. The Victoria County History&#x27;s volume on Surrey, written from 1910 to 1912, does not list East Sheen as a parish, describes its detailed history under Mortlake and states the parish was &quot;now connected with Barnes on one side and with New Richmond on the other&quot;. With the advent of motor transport, the buildings on Mortlake&#x27;s winding high street, also known as the Lower Mortlake Road, have been mostly residential or used by the brewery.

==Stag Brewery or Mortlake Brewery==


In the 1840s Charles James Philips and James Wigan acquired Mortlake Brewery, which had existed since the 15th century.

In 1889 the brewery was acquired by James Watney &amp; Co., which in 1898 became Watney Combe &amp; Reid after acquiring Messrs. Combe Delafield and Co. and Messrs. Reid and Co. When Watney&#x27;s Stag Brewery in Victoria, London, was demolished in 1959, the name was 30 years later, applied to Mortlake Brewery. Being the last phase of The Boat Race which refers to all the traditional local names, it is still widely referred to as the Mortlake Brewery.

The brewery became part of Scottish Courage, briefly part of Heineken and was then divested to Anheuser-Busch Europe Ltd as it produced the company&#x27;s &quot;Budweiser&quot; pale lager. In January 2009, Anheuser-Busch InBev said that the company was proposing to close the Stag Brewery in 2010 as a result of a merger between InBev and Anheuser-Busch. In November 2015, it was announced that the site had been sold for £158m to Reselton – part of Singapore&#x27;s City Developments, which also bought the former Teddington Studios. The brewery closed in December 2015 and there are plans to build 850 apartments on the location.

==Amenities==
Mortlake affords an undistracted view of the river as its riverside promenade is set by its buildings including the former brewery, unlike the embankment style roads along other London banks such as in Barnes until Barnes Bridge.

The two large pubs at either end of the riverside promenade are not listed buildings:
* The White Hart
* The Ship

Places of worship include:
* St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake
* St Mary the Virgin Mortlake (Anglican)

==Transport==
===Adjoining districts===
* Barnes
* Chiswick (Grove Park, after which is Old Chiswick or Strand-on-the-Green, depending on direction)
* East Sheen
* Kew

===Nearest railway stations===
* Mortlake railway station
* Barnes Bridge railway station
* North Sheen railway station

These are minor stops on the Waterloo–Reading line which has four branch lines: to Windsor Riverside station, to Weybridge and back to the London terminus via Kingston upon Thames or Brentford. The stations are only served by trains on the latter two lines, as services to Windsor or Reading bypass both.

This railway is a narrow bisector of the settlement, being generally on the flat with its streets, which tend to run perpendicular to it. It runs in the middle of Worple Way, separating it into north and south sides.

Adjacent to Mortlake Station is Queen Victoria&#x27;s old Waiting Room – now occupied by a classic car showroom – built for her and Prince Albert as they frequented White Lodge in Richmond Park, where their family and later their son, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII ) lived.

==Demography and housing==
To ensure that all the local authority wards have electorates of approximately the same size, the ward covering Mortlake also includes parts of Barnes.

<text>The 1924 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the VIII Olympiad () and officially branded as Paris 1924, were an international multi-sport event held in Paris, France. The opening ceremony was held on 5 July, but some competitions had already started on 4 May. The Games were the second to be hosted by Paris (after 1900), making it the first city to host the Olympics twice.

The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921. The cost of these Games was estimated to be 10,000,000 F (equivalent to in ). With total receipts at 5,496,610 F (equivalent to in ), the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that reached up to 60,000 in number daily. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, having 229 athletes competing compared to France&#x27;s 401.

==Highlights==

* The Uruguay national football team won the gold medal in football, which was recognized as a world championship by FIFA.
* The opening ceremony and several sporting events took place in the Olympic Stadium of Colombes, which had a capacity of 45,000 in 1924.
* This VIII Olympiad was the last one organized under the presidency of Pierre de Coubertin.
* The &quot;Flying Finns&quot; dominated the long-distance running, while the British and Americans dominated the shorter events. Paavo Nurmi won the 1500 m and 5,000 m (which were held with only an hour between them) and the cross-country run. Ville Ritola won the 10,000 m and the 3,000 m steeplechase while finishing second to Nurmi in the 5,000 m and cross country. Albin Stenroos won the marathon, while the Finnish team (with Nurmi and Ritola) was victorious in the 3,000 m and cross-country team events.
* The British runners Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell won the 100 m and the 400 m events, respectively. Liddell refused to compete in the 100-meter dash because it was held on a Sunday, and he was an observant Christian. Their stories were depicted in the 1981 movie &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. In addition, Douglas Lowe won the 800-metre competition.
* DeHart Hubbard became the first African-American to win an individual gold medal in the Long jump.
* The marathon distance was fixed at , from the distance run at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.
* The 1924 Olympics were the first to use the standard 50 m pool with marked lanes.
* Dual-sport athlete Johnny Weissmuller won three gold medals in swimming and one bronze in water polo.
* Harold Osborn won gold medals and set Olympic records in the high jump and the 1924 Olympic decathlon. His 6&#x27; 6&quot; high jump remained the Olympic record for 12 years, while his decathlon score of 7,710.775 points also set a world record and resulted in worldwide press coverage recognizing him as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest athlete.&quot;
* Fencer Roger Ducret of France won five medals, of which three were gold.
* In gymnastics, 24 men scored a perfect 10. Twenty-three scored it in the now-discontinued rope climbing event. Albert Seguin scored a ten here and a perfect ten on the side vault.
* The Olympic motto &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot; (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was used for the first time at the Olympics. It had been used before by the , a French sporting federation whose founding members included Pierre de Coubertin. De Coubertin took the motto from his friend Henri Didon, a Dominican priest who had coined the phrase during a speech before a Paris youth gathering of 1891.
* Ireland was given formal recognition as an independent nation in the Olympic Movement in Paris in 1924, and it was at these games that Ireland made its first appearance in the Olympic Games as an independent nation.
* Originally called &quot;Semaine des Sports d&#x27;Hiver&quot; (&quot;Week of Winter Sports&quot;) and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions held in Chamonix between 25 January and 5 February 1924 were later designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games. (1924 Winter Olympics)
* These were the first Games to have an Olympic Village.
* The Art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics were the first time that the Olympic Art competitions were contested seriously, with 193 entries in five categories. A total of 14 medals were awarded, though none were given in the music category.

===Demonstration sports===
* 
* La canne

===Jeux de L’Enfance===
The Jeux de L’Enfance, a program of youth sports competitions and activities, were held by Olympic organizers alongside the Games in cooperation with the YMCA. The following future Olympic sports were exhibited:
* 

==Venues==
Seventeen sports venues were used in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Stade de Colombes served as the final venue for the 1938 FIFA World Cup between Italy and Hungary.

==Participating nations==
A total of 44 nations were represented at the 1924 Games. Germany was still absent, having not been invited by the Organizing Committee. China (although it did not compete), Ecuador, Ireland, Lithuania, and Uruguay attended the Olympic Games for the first time, while the Philippines competed for first time in an Olympic Games as a nation (though it first participated in the 1900 Summer Olympic Games). Latvia and Poland also attended the Summer Olympic Games for the first time (having both appeared earlier at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix).

The 1924 Olympics saw a return of the following nations: Austria, Bulgaria, Cuba, Haiti, Hungary, Mexico, Romania and Turkey

At the time, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Ireland were all dominions of the British Empire. India was also part of British Empire, but was not a dominion. For other sovereign states (i.e. United States, France, Brazil, Japan, etc) and the international community as a whole (i.e League of Nations) the term dominion, used internally in the British Empire, was very ambiguous, meaning &quot;something between a colony and state&quot;. It was only years later with the Statute of Westminster 1931 that this ambiguity would be dispelled. 

And Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States.
* China also took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its four athletes (all tennis players) withdrew from competition.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===


==Medal count==

These are the nations that won
medals the 1924 Games.
* Pierre de Coubertin—founder of the IOC &amp; father of the modern Olympics movement—personally awarded 21 gold medals to members of the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition including 12 Britons, 7 Indians, 1 Australian and 1 Nepalese.

==Legacy==
The 1924 Summer Olympics was the second edition of the Summer Olympics to be held in Paris. 100 years later, the city has hosted the games once again with the 2024 Summer Olympics, marking its third time, becoming the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the 1908, 1948, and 2012 Games). Paris 2024 also marks the centenary of Chamonix 1924, which in turn marks the centenary of the Winter Olympics; making Paris 2024 the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics), and the first French Olympics since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville.

Notable debuts of participating countries for the Paris 1924 Olympics include Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Philippines, Poland, Romania, and Uruguay; all of which celebrated their centenary participation at the 2024 Summer Olympics back in Paris. 

One venue from the 1924 Games was used in the 2024 Games. The extensively renovated and downsized main stadium, known since 1928 as Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir, hosted field hockey.

The last surviving competitor of the 1924 Summer Olympics was Croatian swimmer Ivo Pavelić, who died on 22 February 2011 at the age of 103; he competed for Yugoslavia, which Croatia was part of at the time. 

Continuation of Jeux de L’Enfance, games for youth sports and competition, from the Paris 1924 was embodied through the creation of Youth Olympics Games inaugurating in Singapore with the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics with 3,600 athletes aged 14–18 from 204 nations competing in 201 events in 26 sports.

<text>Mottingham is a district of south-east London, England, which straddles the border of the London Borough of Bromley, the London Borough of Lewisham and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It is located south west of Eltham, . It was historically within the county of Kent.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The earliest records of Mottingham are from 862 AD during the Anglo-Saxon era when it was recorded as &quot;Modingahema&quot;, which means the land of Moda&#x27;s people and is commonly interpreted as &quot;the proud place&quot;. In William Henry Ireland&#x27;s 1830 work &quot;England&#x27;s Topographer: Or A New and Complete History of the County of Kent Volume 4&quot;, he writes

In the seventeenth century Thomas Fuller recorded in &quot;The Worthies of England&quot; a curious incident that happened on 4 August 1585:
The cause of the incident, referred to as a &quot;marvellous accident&quot; at the time, was then unknown, and it is likely that a sinkhole had developed. The area is well coursed with streams, both above and below ground, and the collapse or shifting of subsoil might be attributed to them. The site of the sinkhole is now unknown, and the incident is also largely unknown. The only body of standing water that is in the area today is a lake at The Tarn Bird Sanctuary.

Mottingham was originally a farming hamlet, with a few large houses on Mottingham Lane, one of them Fairy Hall. Development began in the mid-19th century with the building of cottages on what is now Mottingham Road and the Terrace shops. Mottingham station opened in 1866, but was originally named for Eltham. In the 1880s the West Park estate, housing intended for the middle class, was developed and St. Andrew&#x27;s church was built between the station and the village.

The opening of the Sidcup arterial road in 1923 led to suburban development at Mottingham, with the London County Council creating the Mottingham estate, with 2,000 houses, schools and shops, on Court Farm. The estate opened in 1935. The King and Queen pub, later used as a performance venue, opened in 1937; it was replaced by housing in 1992.

In January 2019, Bromley council approved the borough&#x27;s Local Plan, a document outlining how and where Bromley will be developed up to 2030. Policy 18 details the commitment to improve the vitality and viability of the Mottingham Local Centre and Kimmeridge Cross Neighbourhood Centre, and to enhance links to other areas of Bromley and adjoining boroughs, particularly in relation to centres of employment.

=== Local government ===
Mottingham was originally a hamlet in Eltham parish, in the Blackheath hundred of Kent. In 1840 it was included in the Metropolitan Police District by the Metropolitan Police Act 1839. In 1866, the same year the station was opened, Mottingham was separated from Eltham as a distinct civil parish. In 1881, the parish had a population of 779 and covered an area of .

When the County of London was created in 1889, Mottingham was excluded from the new county and formed a protrusion of Kent, bordering London to the west, north and east. From 1894 to 1934, it formed a &#x27;detached part&#x27; of Bromley Rural District and had its own parish council. In 1931, the parish had a population of 2,120. In 1934, the rural district and the Mottingham civil parish were abolished and the area was transferred to Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District. In 1965, the urban district was abolished and the area was transferred from Kent to Greater London, to form part of the London Borough of Bromley. The boundary between Bromley and Greenwich, and between Bromley and Lewisham, around Mottingham was adjusted in 1994. Most of Mottingham is contained within the Mottingham and Chislehurst North ward of Bromley constituency, but the area around Mottingham Station is in the Coldharbour and New Eltham ward of Eltham constituency.

=== Landmarks ===

The first church in Mottingham was St Andrew&#x27;s Church on Court Road, which was established in 1884 and further helped establish Mottingham as separate from Eltham.

Sir Robert Geffrye&#x27;s almshouses on Mottingham Road were built by the Ironmongers&#x27; Company in 1912 to replace the almshouses in Hoxton that are now the Museum of the Home; they were remodelled by the Greater London Council and additional housing built in the grounds.

Martins Bank had a branch in Mottingham village, facing the war memorial; it was the first branch of the bank to undergo an armed raid, in 1967. It became a Barclays following their 1969 takeover of Martins, was closed in 1992.

Also by the war memorial stood the Porcupine Inn public house, licensed as long ago as 1688. The premises dated from about 1800 and were replaced in 1922. The pub closed in 2013 and was acquired by German global discount supermarket chain Lidl, who tried and failed to obtain permission to develop the site. In 2022, Lidl appealed over the head of Bromley Borough and were given permission to clear the site and build their new supermarket. The new store opened for business in April 2023.

Mottingham has a branch of the fraternal order Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity.

Mottingham village contains a sign depicting Eltham College within the branches of a tree, a cricket bat and ball (making reference to W G Grace) and the date AD 862.

Mottingham and some of its landmarks appear in filmmaker Dewyne Lindsay&#x27;s mini-documentary series &quot;London Districts&quot;.

=== Education ===
==== Mottingham Primary School ====

==== Elmstead Wood Primary School ====

==== Capel Manor College ====
Capel Manor College is a specialist environmental college offering land-based further and higher education on a campus that was previously part of Hadlow College.

==== Eltham College ====

Eltham College, an independent day school for girls and boys 7–18, founded in 1842 as the London Missionary Society&#x27;s School for the Sons of Missionaries, has been housed since 1912 in the former Fairy Hall in Mottingham, which had earlier been the Royal Naval School from 1889 to 1910.

==Geography==

Mottingham borders Eltham to the north, New Eltham to the east, Chislehurst to the south, Elmstead to the south west, Lewisham to the west and Lee to the north west. Since 2010, Mottingham has fallen within the Mottingham and Chislehurst North polling and policing districts.

===Quaggy===
A tributary of the River Quaggy known as the Little Quaggy flows through Mottingham; rising on the borders of Chislehurst and Mottingham, it flows through The Tarn and emerges alongside the Sidcup bypass to join the Quaggy, which continues to Mottingham playing fields (colloquially known as &#x27;Foxes Field&#x27;).

===Mottingham Estate===

London County Council bought the Court Farm estate in the early 1930s and planned a 2000 home cottage estate. The first houses were to the west of Mottingham Road and completed in 1935. The estate was fairly self-contained; the community facilities included a shopping centre and several schools.

The British gangster film &quot;Piggy&quot; was filmed around North Kent, Mottingham and London and one scene was filmed in The Prince of Wales pub on Mottingham Road. African American boxer Frank Craig trained at the Prince of Wales for the bout he ultimately lost to Australian Dan Creedon in 1895.

===Coldharbour Estate===
In 1946 Woolwich Council built the Coldharbour Estate to the east of Mottingham Road, primarily to provide accommodation for local people made homeless by the Blitz. This completed the use of the LCC land.
