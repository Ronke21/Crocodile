<text>The Société nationale des chemins de fer français (, , SNCF ) is France&#x27;s national state-owned railway company. Founded in 1938, it operates the country&#x27;s national rail traffic along with that of Monaco, including the TGV, on France&#x27;s high-speed rail network. Its functions include operation of railway services for passengers and freight (through its subsidiaries SNCF Voyageurs and Rail Logistics Europe), as well as maintenance and signalling of rail infrastructure (SNCF Réseau). The railway network consists of about of route, of which are high-speed lines and electrified. About 14,000 trains are operated daily.

In 2010 the SNCF was ranked 22nd in France and 214th globally on the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 list. It is the main business of the SNCF Group, which in 2020 had €30 billion of sales in 120 countries. The SNCF Group employs more than 275,000 employees in France and around the world. Since July 2013, the SNCF Group headquarters are located in a Parisian suburb at 2 Place aux Étoiles in Saint-Denis. The president of SNCF Group has been since 2019.

==Business scope==
===High-speed rail===
SNCF operates almost all of France&#x27;s railway traffic, including the TGV (&quot;Train à Grande Vitesse&quot;, meaning &quot;high-speed train&quot;). In the 1970s, the SNCF began the TGV high-speed train program with the intention of creating the world&#x27;s fastest railway network. It came to fruition in 1981 with the completion of the first high-speed line LGV Sud-Est (&quot;Ligne à Grande Vitesse Sud-Est&quot;, meaning &quot;southeast high-speed line&quot;), where the first TGV service, from Paris to Lyon, was inaugurated. In 2017, the national rail network owned by SNCF Réseau had 28,710 km (17,839 mi) of lines, 58% of which were electrified and 2,640 high-speed lines. Every day, the SNCF runs 15,000 commercial trains and transports more than 5 million passengers and more than 250,000 tonnes of goods. TGV lines and TGV technology are now spread across several European countries.

The SNCF&#x27;s TGV has set many world speed records, the most recent on 3 April 2007, when a new version of the TGV dubbed the V150 with larger wheels than the usual TGV, was able to cover more ground with each rotation and had a stronger engine, and broke the world speed record for conventional railway trains, reaching .

The SNCF has a remarkable safety record. After nearly 30 years in operation, SNCF&#x27;s TGV system has only experienced one fatal accident, which occurred during pre-opening testing and not in regular operation.

===United Kingdom===
In 2011 SNCF in partnership with Keolis, unsuccessfully bid for the InterCity West Coast franchise. In April 2017 SNCF took a 30% shareholding in a joint venture with Stagecoach Group and Virgin Group to bid for the West Coast Partnership that will operate services on the West Coast Main Line from May 2020 and the High Speed 2 line from 2026.

In April 2019 Stagecoach were banned from bidding for any franchises including the West Coast Partnership which has meant that Virgin and SNCF have now had to withdraw from the shortlist.

===SNCF operations===
Since the 1990s, SNCF has been selling railway carriages to regional governments, with the creation of the Train Express Régional brand. SNCF also maintains a broad scope of international business that includes work on freight lines, inter-city lines and commuter lines. SNCF experts provide logistics, design, construction, operations and maintenance services. SNCF operates the international ticketing agency SNCF Connect, formerly oui.sncf/Voyages-sncf.com and Rail Europe, previously Loco 2.

SNCF has employees in 120 countries offering extensive overseas and cross border consulting. Those projects include

*Israel: Assistance and Training. SNCF International provides assistance to Israel Railways in every area of rail operations including projects to upgrade the network&#x27;s general safety regulations. Other assistance and training programmes involve Infrastructure and the Traction Division.
*Taiwan: Operations Training. SNCF supervised the prime contractor responsible for construction of the Taiwan Railways Administration&#x27;s main high-speed rail line. It also trained rail traffic controllers, drivers, and crew members. On behalf of the Government of Taiwan, SNCF managed the high-speed railway Command Control Centre.
*United Kingdom: Maintenance. In 2007–2008, SNCF-International consultants audited the maintenance practices applied to the track, signalling and overhead electric power line on British high-speed rail lines connecting London to the Channel Tunnel. In addition, it conducted an audit of the maintainer&#x27;s performance from the service quality and cost control standpoint, made recommendations for improvements, and proposed a three-year Business Plan.
*South Korea: HSR Electrification Design. SNCF advised Korean Railroads on the electrification of tracks between Daegu and Busan and on linking existing conventional tracks to the new high-speed line. SNCF also assisted in selecting and inspecting high-speed rolling stock and trained 400 senior manager, engineers, and executives in a broad range of skills, including signalling, catenaries, track, rolling stock maintenance, HSR operation, safety management, marketing, and passenger information systems. Until the end of 2009, SNCF assisted Korea in maintaining its high-speed.
*Spain: Signalling System. SNCF partnered with ADIF (Spanish railway infrastructure provider) in the study, supply, installation, and maintenance of the standard EU railway signaling system along the Madrid-Lleida high-speed line. On behalf of the Spanish Government, SNCF designed and led maintenance operations on this line over a two-year period.
*France: Lead Infrastructure and Rolling Stock Maintainer – The SNCF maintains of track, 26,500 main sets of points and crossings, 2,300 signal boxes, 80,000 track circuits, over 1 million relays, etc. It also maintains 3,900 locomotives and 500 high-speed trains. Each of SNCF&#x27;s TGV trains travels more than a month – enough to circle the globe. Each year SNCF&#x27;s Human Resources Department provides over 1.2 million hours of training to its over 25,000 employees.
*Morocco: Design, construction and operations for the Al Boraq bullet train service between Tangier and Casablanca
==History==

SNCF was formed in 1938 with the nationalisation of France&#x27;s main railway companies (&quot;Chemin de fer&quot;, literally, &#x27;way of iron&#x27;, means railway). These were the:
* Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est (Est, &quot;Eastern Railways&quot;)
* Chemins de fer de l&#x27;État (État, &quot;State Railways&quot;; merged in 1908 with the Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Ouest, &quot;Western Railways&quot;)
* Chemins de fer du Nord (Nord, &quot;Northern Railways&quot;)
* Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM, &quot;Paris, Lyon and Mediterranean Railways&quot;)
* Chemins de fer de Paris à Orléans et du Midi (&quot;Paris, Orléans and Southern Railways&quot;; PO-Midi, formed in 1934 from the merger of the Chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans and the Chemins de fer du Midi)
* Administration des chemins de fer d&#x27;Alsace et de Lorraine (AL, &quot;Alsace-Lorraine Railways&quot;)
* Syndicats du Chemin de fer de Grande Ceinture et de Petite Ceinture (&quot;Great and Small Belt Railways&quot;) in Paris and its suburbs.

The French state originally took 51% ownership of SNCF and invested large amounts of public subsidies into the system. Today, SNCF is wholly owned by the French state.

===World War II===

Following the 1940 Armistice and until August 1944, SNCF was requisitioned for the transport of German armed forces and armaments. The invading German troops were responsible for the destruction of nearly 350 French railway bridges and tunnels. According to differing estimates, SNCF surrendered between 125,000 and 213,000 wagons and 1,000–2,000 locomotives.
France&#x27;s railway infrastructure and rolling stocks were a target for the French Resistance aimed at disrupting and fighting the German occupying forces. This allowed SNCF employees to perform many acts of resistance, including the formation of the Résistance-Fer movement in 1943. Nearly 1,700 SNCF railway workers were killed or deported for resisting Nazi orders. 150 Résistance-Fer agents were shot for their acts of resistance, 500 of them were deported. Half of those deported died in concentration camps.

German occupying forces in France also requisitioned SNCF to transport nearly 77,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims to Nazi extermination camps. These deportations have been the subject of historical controversy and lawsuits (such as the Lipietz case) in France as well as in the United States (where subsidiary Keolis is a transportation contractor) to the present day.

In 1992 SNCF commissioned French academics to write a history of SNCF activities during World War II. The resultant report was published in 1996.

More recently, some sources have claimed that SNCF billed Nazi-occupied France for third-class tickets for Holocaust victims transported to extermination camps, although passengers were transported in cattle cars. Other sources have reported that after the liberation of France SNCF continued to seek payment for transporting Holocaust victims to Germany. However, historian Michael Marrus has written that claims that SNCF billed for third-class tickets and continued to seek payment after the war ended were made as part of a legal case brought against SNCF, and did not match with historians&#x27; understanding of what happened. Marrus argues that SNCF had no margin of maneuver during the German occupation and that the actions of SNCF employees were not ideologically motivated. According to Serge Klarsfeld, president of the organization Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France, SNCF was forced by German and Vichy authorities to cooperate in providing transport for French Jews to the border and did not make any profit from this transport.

In December 2014, SNCF agreed to pay up to $60 million worth of compensation to Holocaust survivors in the United States. It corresponds to approximately $100,000 per survivor.

===Modern era===
In the early 2000s, SNCF sought to get a contract from the state of California for a bullet train project between Los Angeles and San Francisco. SNCF recommended that the train take the most direct route between the two locations to reduce the complexity and cost of the project, but the SNCF&#x27;s recommendations were cast aside by California politicians who wanted to divert the train through various communities, raising the cost and complexity of the project, as well as the expected travel time. SNCF pulled out of the project in 2011 and went to Morocco to help the country construct a bullet train service. By 2018, Morocco&#x27;s bullet train started service while the California bullet train project was not close to being operational in 2022, with some saying that the project would never be completed.

In May 2014, the company had discovered that 2,000 new trains they ordered at a cost of 15 billion euros are too wide for many of France&#x27;s regional platforms. Construction work has started to reconfigure them.

On 1 January 2015, Réseau ferré de France (RFF) merged with SNCF Infra and the Direction de la circulation ferroviaire (DCF) and became &quot;SNCF Réseau&quot;, the operational assets of SNCF became &quot;SNCF Mobilités&quot;, and both groups were placed under the control of SNCF.

Jean-Pierre Farandou, the head of the state-owned railway operator, SNCF informed on 26 July 2024 that its high-speed rail network Eurostar suffered from multiple instances of coordinated sabotage, causing significant disruptions to train services. The incident occurred just hours before the opening ceremony of the Olympics, which was considered a high-risk event. The affected lines were located in the western, northern, and eastern regions of France, impacting not only domestic trains but also those travelling to neighboring Belgium and London via the Channel Tunnel. It was expected that roughly 800,000 travellers were impacted because of this arson attack on French railway networks.

===Design===

The industrial designer Paul Arzens styled many of SNCF&#x27;s locomotives from the 1940s until the 1970s. A particularly distinctive type is the &quot;broken nose&quot; style of electric and diesel locomotives.

==Codeshare with airlines==
SNCF codeshares with Air Austral, Air France, Air Tahiti Nui, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Middle East Airlines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and SriLankan Airlines. In exchange, SNCF allows passengers on these flights to book railway services between Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy (near Paris) and Aix-en-Provence, Angers, Avignon, Bordeaux, Le Mans, Lille, Lyon Part-Dieu, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, Nîmes, Poitiers, Rennes, Strasbourg, Tours, and Valence with their airline. The IATA designator used by airlines in connection with these journeys is 2C.

Continental Airlines discontinued its codeshare with SNCF on 15 August 2010.

==Company structure==
===Headquarters===

Until 1999, the SNCF&#x27;s historic headquarters was located at 88 Rue Saint-Lazare in the 9th arrondissement. In 1996 the chairman of SNCF, Louis Gallois, announced that SNCF would move its headquarters to a new location during the middle of 1997.

From 1999 to 2013, SNCF&#x27;s headquarters were located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of the 14th arrondissement of Paris, located near the Gare Montparnasse.

Since July 2013, the SNCF headquarters are located in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis at 2, place aux Étoiles, 93200 Saint Denis. The move was motivated by cutting operating costs by 10 million euros per year.

== Company image ==
According to a TNS SOFRES survey published in 2010, 66% of French people have a good image of SNCF. At the end of 2019, this proportion was measured at 50% by the Posternak-Ifop barometer on the image of companies. In 2020, Eight Advisory and IFOP unveil their ranking of the &quot;most admired French companies&quot;: SNCF is in 23rd position.

Safety on trains is also often a priority. To do this, around 2,800 railway workers form the Railway Security, the general supervision of SNCF, of which 50% of the workforce is assigned to the Île-de-France region.

Furthermore, the experts of the BCG, Boston Consulting Group, use to compare the rail systems in 25 European countries. They rank France in tied 4th position (with Germany, Austria and Sweden), behind Switzerland, Denmark and Finland. The criteria are : the utilization rate, quality of service and safety.

== Visual and sound identity ==

=== Logotype ===
SNCF&#x27;s current visual logo was created in 2005 by the Carré Noir agency, a subsidiary of the Publicis communication group. It was slightly reworked in 2011: rounded corners, disappearance of shadows inside the letters as well as behind, and a clearer separation between them.

=== Sound Identity ===
The SNCF sound logo – the four notes C – G – A flat – E flat –, in a sung version, was created in 2005 by Michaël Boumendil. David Gilmour, guitarist of the group Pink Floyd, used the jingle as the inspiration for the title track of his 2015 album &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot;. Simone Hérault has been the voice of SNCF since 1981.

== Culture ==

=== Cinema ===
Since the Auguste and Louis Lumière&#x27;s first film, SNCF has been the company that hosts the most film shoots in France, between 50 and 60 shoots per year, which represents around two thirds of French productions. A selection of iconic films where SNCF is at the heart of the matter include: 
* Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday 
* The Tourist 
* Hugo Cabret &lt;br&gt; (Hugo)

=== TV Show ===
* Killing Eve

<text>Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A (&quot;Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A.&quot; also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) is a Brazilian low-cost airline based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2019, Gol had 37.7% of the domestic and 3.8% of the international market shares in terms of passenger-kilometers flown, making it the largest domestic and third largest international airline in Brazil.

Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries primarily with LATAM Brasil and Azul. It also owned the brand Varig between 2007 and 2013, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the &quot;new&quot; Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct &quot;old&quot; Varig airline, founded in 1927.

Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, and Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre. Gol refers to itself as GOL Intelligent Airlines (GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company was traded on the New York Stock Exchange as &quot;GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A.&quot; from 2004 to 2024.

The company&#x27;s name is a Brazilian Portuguese word borrowing from the English word &quot;goal&quot; from association football. The company slogan is &quot;Nova Gol. Novos tempos no ar.&quot; ; &quot;New Gol. New times in the air.&quot; .

It is informed the debt of company until final July 2024 totals R$ 29.1 billion.

==History==

The airline was established in 2000 as Gol Transportes Aéreos S.A. and started operations on 15 January 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo. It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil&#x27;s largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.

In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1.5%). The growth in GOL&#x27;s stock price made the Constantino family a member of the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine billionaire list in 2005.

In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines.

On 24 February 2010, Gol announced it was in &quot;advanced talks&quot; to join the Oneworld alliance, which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on 6 October 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a &quot;patchwork of code-sharing agreements.&quot;. Following this trend, on 28 September 2011, Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.

On 18 March 2010, Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120. Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013, it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.

On 23 December 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on 31 July 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.

On 7 December 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares. The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of GOL&#x27;s Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.

On 1 October 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.

On 6 October 2012, Gol started seasonal operations at Miami and Orlando, which are available for Smiles account holders and originated in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.

In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

Some disagreement exists about whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second-best low-cost airline in South America after Azul. Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, &quot;GOL&#x27;s costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore.&quot;.

On 26 September 2019, Delta announced that it will exit its minority stake in GOL, following Delta acquiring 20% stake of LATAM Airlines Group.

On 11 May 2022, it was announced that Gol would merge with Avianca to form the Abra Group, which would own both companies.

Celso Ferrer became the CEO of the Brazilian airline 1 July 2022.

In March 2023, Gol reduced frequencies in Fortaleza as well as cancelled the Fortaleza airline&#x27;s hub.

In January 2024, Gol prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stating that the airline has been struggling with high debt and recently hired Seabury Capital to help it in a broad capital structure review. As a result, the company&#x27;s shares tumbled as much as 13% or 27% at Ibovespa. On 24 January 2024, Gol sought US$950 million in financing to fund itself during its bankruptcy procedures. On 25 January 2024, Gol declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York to bounce back from high debt costs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the bankruptcy procedure, Gol continued to operate. Gol declared more than US$8.3 billion in debt as well as a summe of more than R$40 billion. Following, Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody downgraded Gol&#x27;s rating, Gol lied and owes more than R$1.1 billion to the Air Force and admitted it did not paid air navigation fees in Brazil and Gol (GOLL4) studied measures against Latam for trying to take over planes. According to Gol&#x27;s lawyers, Latam had sent letters to the lessors. The Debt with Workers is more than R$1.3 billion. R$420 million in judicial processes in Brazil. Banco do Brasil and Bradesco questioned Gol&#x27;s DIP Financing guarantees.

===Purchase of Varig===
On 28 March 2007, Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the &quot;new Varig,&quot; a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities hedge fund. At that time, the &quot;old Varig&quot; was under bankruptcy protection. Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA posted a first-quarter loss of 3.5 million Reais (2 million US dollars) after revenues of 1.6 billion Reais (one billion US dollars).

Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas. The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million. The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as &quot;old Varig,&quot; which continued to exist until its bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.

In 2009, Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700s configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter was also used in wet-lease operations. This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network and has aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.

Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the &quot;new Varig&quot; (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the &quot;old Varig&quot; (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on 20 August 2010.

===Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas===
On 9 July 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas. The purchase contract was signed on 2 August 2011. On 10 October 2012, the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency. Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks. Integration started on 17 October 2012 when sales requested via Webjet&#x27;s web-portal started to be redirected to GOL&#x27;s site. However, on 23 November 2012, Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by GOL. The Webjet brand ceased to exist. Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet&#x27;s Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet&#x27;s 737-800s.

===Partnership with TwoFlex===
On 12 April 2019, Gol announced an adapted Essential Air Service partnership with TwoFlex in which the latter would operate feeder services on behalf of Gol in the States of Amazonas, Pará and Mato Grosso using the Cessna 208 Caravan. The flights are marketed by Gol in its reservation platform but operated by TwoFlex and integrated into the network of Gol. This partnership greatly increased the number of Gol destinations in these three States. However, on 14 January 2020, Azul Brazilian Airlines signed an agreement to purchase Twoflex. On 27 March 2020, the Brazilian regulatory bodies gave the nihil obstat to the purchase and sale of flights started on 14 April 2020. thus ending the partnership.

===Purchase of MAP Linhas Aéreas===
On 8 June 2021, Gol Linhas Aéreas announced the purchase of MAP Linhas Aéreas from Voepass Linhas Aéreas. The transaction included 26 slots at São Paulo–Congonhas Airport belonging to MAP and Voepass. MAP&#x27;s Amazonian operations and much of its fleet would be transferred to Voepass.

===Operational agreement with Voepass===
Between August 2021 and May 2023, Gol and Voepass had an operational agreement in which the latter operated certain routes for the former.

Smiles was part of the &quot;new Varig&quot; package bought by GOL, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.

On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.

In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 29 September 2006, Flight 1907, operated by a Boeing 737-800 SFP (Short Field Performance) registered as PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet registered N600XL, near the town of Matupá, south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft broke up in mid-air and crashed in the Amazon rainforest, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet. As of 2025, Flight 1907 is the only fatal accident in the airline&#x27;s history.
* On 29 April 2022, a Gol Linhas Aéreas Boeing 737 registered as PR-GUQ collided with an Azul Brazilian Airlines Embraer E195 while taxiing at Viracopos International Airport after landing from Santos Dumont Airport. Nobody was injured, with damage only caused to the 737&#x27;s left winglet and the E195&#x27;s tailcone.
* On 11 February 2025, Flight G3-1674 using a 737 MAX 8, registration PS-GPP collided with a maintenance car while accelerating for takeoff at Galeão Airport of Rio de Janeiro. The aircraft aborted and came to a standstill and the passengers left the plane normally. No injuries were reported.

<doc id="87115" wikidata="Q1335161" url="?curid=87115" title="Model car">
<text>A model car, or toy car, is a miniature representation of an automobile. Other miniature motor vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or even ATVs, etc. are often included in this general category. Because many miniature vehicles were originally aimed at children as playthings, there is no precise difference between a model car and a toy car, yet the word &#x27;model&#x27; implies either assembly required or the accurate rendering of an actual vehicle at smaller scale. The kit building hobby became popular through the 1950s, while the collecting of miniatures by adults started to gain momentum around 1970. Precision-detailed miniatures made specifically for adults are a significant part of the market since the mid-1980s.

The scope of the vehicles involved in the hobby, according to Louis Heilbroner Hertz author of &quot;The Complete Book of Building and Collecting Model Automobiles&quot;, encompasses &quot;ordinary or stock automobiles, racing cars ([...]), buses, trucks, specialized service vehicles (especially fire engines), military vehicles, including such equipment as self-propelled gun carriers and mobile rocket launchers; construction equipment, including bulldozers and road rollers, tractors and related farm equipment; mobile showmen&#x27;s engines, customized automobiles, hot rods, dragsters, the recently popular so-called &#x27;funny cars&#x27;, early self-propelled road carriages, and so on.&quot;

==History==
Miniature models of automobiles first appeared in Europe around the time real automobiles did. Then, shortly after, they appeared in the United States. These were toys and replicas often made of lead and brass. Later models made in the early 20th century were slush cast plaster or iron. Tin and pressed steel cars, trucks, and military vehicles, like those made by Bing of Germany, were introduced in the 1920s through the 1940s, but period models rarely copied actual vehicles, likely because of the crudeness of early casting and metal shaping techniques. Casting vehicles in alloys such as zinc-aluminum-magnesium-copper (trademarked as zamak) became popular in the late 1930s and remained prominent after World War II.

=== Fabricating the &#x27;real&#x27; thing ===

Many early model cars were not intended either as toys or for collecting. By the 1920s, the manufacturers of real automobiles would design and construct scale as well as full-sized models for design or promotion. Citroën of France, for example, made its own models for promotional purposes as early as 1923. Sometimes styling or concept models were made out of wood or clay, often in 3/8 scale. From 1930 until 1968, General Motors sponsored the Fisher Body Craftsman&#x27;s Guild Competition where hundreds of modelers competed for scholarship money.. The emphasis was to earn recognition for creativity which would lead to possible employment as an industry stylist.

In-house models could also be precise replicas made of similar materials to the real vehicles. For example, Hudson Motor Car Company made twelve precisely crafted 1/4 scale replicas of its 1932 vehicles for promotion at the 1932 New York Auto Show (see Hudson display models). About the same time, but in a different vein, Studebaker made a wooden model of a cabriolet over &quot;twice&quot; the size of the real car. The vehicle was stationary on the company grounds and large enough to hold a whole band that played mostly for photo shoots (Quinn 2004). As time went by, companies in the United States, Europe and Asia made, provided, or sold toys or precision promotional models to attract succeeding generations to their products. More models also displayed advertising on their bodies for non-automotive promotions.
=== Scale sizes ===

The scales of toy and model cars vary according to historical precedent, market demand and the need for detail. Many &#x27;in house&#x27; models of real car companies are made by professional modelers in full size, or at very large scales like 1:4, 1:5, 3:8, or 1:10 to portray adequate features and proportions. For toys, many European pre-war cars and trucks were made to display with railroad layouts, making 1:87 (1 to 2 inches, or HO scale) or 1:43 (about 4 inches long, or O scale) common scales. Other companies made vehicles in variations around 1:40 to 1:50 scales. Some companies went smaller to appeal to the hands of smaller children (about 1:64 scale or about 3 inches), which improved profit margins in packaging more items per carton, and increasing profit per vehicle sold. Others moved to larger scales from 1:43 toward 1:40, 1:38 or 1:35. Later, popular scales went even larger. In the United States, 1:25 (6 to 7 inches) became the staple size for plastic promotional models, while European manufacturers went to 1:24 or 1:18 (about 9 inches long). The larger 1:12 scale was occasionally seen and more rarely, 1:10 or 1:8. At the other extreme, some very tiny toys since the 1980s were fairly accurate down to about 1:120 (a little over an inch).
=== Materials and markets ===

Toys in the United States almost always were simpler castings of zinc alloy (zamak), pressed steel or plastic and often castings of only seven parts (a car body, four plastic wheels and two axles) – while more complex plastic and zamak models in Europe often had precision detail with more working features. This provides instruction on different regions of the world and their varied cultures, markets, labor and economies.

Europe quickly developed niche marketing after World War II. The greater availability of labor there generally allowed the development of relatively complex toys to serve different markets in different countries. In the United States, less labor availability would not allow for complex toys with opening doors, hoods, and complete interiors with all detail, so they were often single castings with few parts. Sophistication in America did come in the form of detailed (but simply cast) promotional models for automotive dealerships which preceded the appearance of automotive kits for assembly.

==European die casting==
 Among more collectible vehicles in Europe after World War II and during the 1950s, smaller scales, like 1:43, and 1:64 generally became popular first. Since the 1980s, many factory assembled scale model cars made of diecast metal have become more and more adult collectible oriented and less and less toy-like. Besides the smaller scales, these models are manufactured in various scales like 1:12, 1:18, and 1:24.

=== Early European diecast ===

Northern Europe and the British Isles were the homes of the most successful European producers in the 1950s and 1960s in the post-war revitalized economies across the continent (Rixon 2005, p. 9). Quite popular were models produced in the altered railroad modeling scale of 1:43.

Examples of well known companies are (or were) Corgi Toys, Dinky Toys, Matchbox, and Spot-On Models of the United Kingdom; Solido, Norev, and Majorette of France; Schuco Modell, Gama, and Siku of (West) Germany; Tekno of Denmark, and Mercury, Polistil and Mebetoys of Italy. Immediately post-war, Belgium made Septoy and Gasquy. Even Israel got into the act quite successfully with Gamda Koor Sabra which made its own tooling for several unique models. Non-market system communist countries also had some successful factories, like Kaden models and Igra of Czechoslovakia, Espewe of East Germany, and Estetyka of Poland. State factories of the Soviet Union (commonly known as Novoexport, Saratov, or Tantal) produced many carefully crafted diecast models mostly in 1:43 scale. These were known for their intricate detail, numerous parts, and delicate construction. 

Larger sizes in die-cast grew out of offerings of European companies like Polistil, Schuco Modell, and Martoys, which was later to become Bburago. 1:24 and 1:18 scales did not become really popular until the late 1980s when other brands like Yatming and Maisto were produced in Hong Kong or China by either American or Asian companies. 1:87 scale plastic vehicles, related to railroad modeling or not, also continue to be popular in Europe. Despite continued European companies, today, China is now the center of diecast production.
Post-war European diecast models were produced in fairly simple form, such as Dinky Toys (often in the train related 1:64 or 1:43). Dinky production began in 1934, while Matchbox cars (often approx. 1:64) were introduced in the mid-1950s. These early die-cast toys featured no opening parts whatsoever. Affected by market forces and by improvements in production technology, companies began to improve the quality of the toys over time. The &quot;best&quot; improvements were often copied by the competition within 1–2 years of their appearance on the market. Examples of these would be plastic windows, interiors, separate wheel/tire assemblies, working suspensions, opening/moving parts, jeweled headlights, mask-spraying or tampo-printing, and low-friction &#x27;fast&#x27; wheels.

Into the 1970s, model makers began to feel the squeeze of rising costs. Often press tooling for a new model might cost more than 30,000 pounds (more than US$50,000). Companies began to offer fewer new issues and the models became simpler with fewer opening parts.

=== Trends in toy detail ===

Larger 1:24 and 1:18 scale premium models became extremely popular at toy and hobby centers during the 1990s, but are less popular circa 2010. This size is generally made with close attention to the details of the real vehicles, such as a working steering, and opening doors, trunk/boot, and hood/bonnet. Detailed interiors, instrument panels, trunks/boots with spare tires and engine compartments are common. Chassis often show intricacies of exhaust systems and suspensions. A working suspension system is often included. In smaller scales some of the details are often eliminated, so in 1:43, 1:64, or 1:87 scale cars, working steering is not common. Likewise, only the front doors and hood might open, with non-opening rear doors and trunk. (There are exceptions, of course, such as the steering by lever on the late 1960s 3 inch Ford Mustang by Matchbox or the patented steering on 1:32 Modarri toy cars.)

Over time, market pressures have caused further changes in the way models are designed and manufactured. In the 1960s, many European models had opening parts and working components, but today few of the smaller scale toys do. More working parts mean more production expense and Hot Wheels and Matchbox vehicles now rarely have such features. Today, the number of moving parts has been reduced even in large-scale models. For example, premium model maker AUTOart introduced a line of race and sports cars in 1:18 scale with no opening parts.

=== Die cast seconds ===
Also notable is the diffusion of model dies to companies in other countries which could not afford tooling expenses for their own new lines. Traditionally, when European companies have finished marketing their models, newer dies are developed and introduced and older dies are sold off to other companies, often in less developed countries.

As early as about 1970, Dinky tooling became &#x27;Nicky&#x27; Toys in India, just as older Matchbox models became &#x27;Miltons&#x27; or Corgi dies became &#x27;Maxwell&#x27;. Many dies previously made by Corgi, Efsi, Tekno, Sablon or Solido, trekked southward in Europe to Spanish or Portuguese companies like MetOsul, Nacoral or Auto Pilen. Politoys became MacGregor in Mexico and also showed up in plastic in the Soviet Union. Earlier Solido and Schuco dies made their way to Brazil. Even some of Mattel&#x27;s earlier Hot Wheels tooling showed up in Argentina as Muky. Tomicas became Yat Mings, Tomicas and Yat Mings became Playarts, and Matchbox tooling reappeared in other forms in many places.

The trend is nearly always a diffusion from more industrialized to somewhat lesser industrialized countries and often the result is poorer paint, faulty zamac alloys, and imprecise assembly. One example was the copies of Italian Ediltoys made by Meboto in Turkey. The Argentine Mukys featured paint that was flat and dull, unlike the bright colors of the original Hot Wheels. At the other extreme, Auto Pilen of Spain was an exception and copied models beautifully. These were as good as, or sometimes better, than the original Dinkys or Solidos in quality and paint.

== Collecting ==
Organized collecting of model cars developed shortly after the models first appeared on the market. Even before such companies as Corgi and Dinky were ten years old, adults were collecting them, particularly in the UK and the USA. Often, as well, adults seek the joys of childhood, collecting what they had destroyed in youth or what their parents had thrown away. This also lead to the foundation of the Diecast Hall of Fame in 2009.

===The adult collector===
Many manufacturers began catering to the adult collector market. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, David Sinclair in Erie, Pennsylvania, was important in bringing new, more sophisticated and rarely produced years and makes to the United States. Model brands like Rio, Western Models, Brooklin, Idea3 and Pirate Models were sold to adult collectors for the first time. Many of these were handmade in white metal in fewer numbers. Also in the early 1970s, craftsmen like Carlo Brianza and Michelle Conti started making ultra-detailed large replicas in Italy and Spain – costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars. In addition, the company Pocher, from Italy, made extremely complex kits in 1:8 scale

Around the early 1990s, many began to collect and record vehicle variations in miniature (in a manner similar to stamp or coin collecting) which led to rising values, especially for rare models (for an example, see Parker 1993). This led to mass producers such as Matchbox (specifically with its Models of Yesteryear series) and Corgi intentionally catering to a higher-price market segment with exclusive &#x27;limited editions&#x27; of collectible vehicles. Thus, this smaller movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s gradually gave rise to a huge premium market segment by the early 1990s.

===Licensing===
The collectors&#x27; market also led to licensing aspects not known until the 1980s. In the 1950s and 1960s, models were produced spontaneously without licensing agreements, and real auto manufacturers saw it as free advertising. Today, model companies have licensing arrangements with real car manufacturers to make replicas of their products, whether they be concepts, cars in current production, or models no longer produced.

Licenses appear on models where model car manufacturers enter similar licensing agreements. Licenses are expensive, which enhances the position of mass producers of model cars, while smaller companies have been marginalized and forced out of business. For example, when Ferrari entered into an exclusive agreement with Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels, companies like Solido and Bburago felt the crunch, and Bburago went out of business (though the name was eventually reacquired by Maisto).

===Collectible manufacturers and locations===
Manufacturers focusing on premium models, usually in white metal and sometimes resin, include Brooklin Models, Western Models, Enchantment Land, Conquest / Madison, Durham Classics, Elegance Models, Mini Auto Emporium, Mini Marque, Motor City USA, Tron, Starter, RacingModels, SMTS and Victory. Several of these started production in the 1970s and 1980s and were handmade in the United States, Canada, or England with the occasional constructor in France, Belgium or the Netherlands. A couple of geographical oddities include Goldvarg (made in Argentina) and some early Milestone Models which were made in South Africa. Mail order companies like Franklin Mint and Danbury Mint also focus on the collector market, though in a more popular vein.

Since 2000, more than fifty different diecast, resin and white metal manufacturers in England, France, Italy, Ukraine and Russia have exploded onto the adult collector market. These include Spark which focus on motorsport such as 24h Le Mans and F1, Bizarre is the brand dedicated to the unusual and extraordinary in the car world, FDS, YOW Modellini (from Japan) and many others. Since 2000, companies like Altaya, Ixo, and Model Car World (for example, with its White Box line) have been started in Europe – with production increasingly seen in China. Many of these producers have focused on global auto marques producing vehicles that were produced in Russia or Brazil. Some of these companies only produce kits – others produce kits and build them up to order. Still others are professional kit builders, who do not produce the kits themselves.

==Promotional models==

Promotional models are sometimes used when the real auto manufacturers contract with model or toy companies to make copies of their real vehicles. Some of the earliest promotional models were from the early 1930s, when TootsieToy introduced a line of 1932 Grahams and later, the 1935 LaSalle. These were both diecast and made available in boxes with the brand name displayed with appropriate logos and colors (Seeley, No Date). National Products made models of about 1/28th scale starting in 1934. Later manufacturers like Winross, Lesney Matchbox, Lledo, AHL, and White Rose used their toy vehicles to advertise logos on their flanks promoting various companies.
In the U.S., Banthrico started producing diecast promotional model car banks in the late 1940s for the banking industry. These coin-banks were available as gifts to customers who opened a new account and had a slot in the bottom to put their spare change. Usually the bank&#x27;s name and address was painted on the roof of the car. Banthrico models were also painted in authentic Big Three colors and used as &quot;paint chips&quot; so dealers could gauge the upcoming colors on real models. These primitive promotionals included Buicks, Cadillacs, Lincolns, Packards, DeSotos, Chryslers, Dodges, Ramblers and the more common Chevrolets and Fords.

In the United States, the word &#x27;promo&#x27; is usually associated with 1:25 scale plastic, pre-assembled models. In Europe, promotionals were made in smaller vehicle sizes in diecast zamac in 1:32, 1:43, or 1:50 scales. In the case of Chrysler&#x27;s later Turbine Car, where 50 real cars were put into consumer use, the model by Jo-Han was widely distributed as a good will gesture by Chrysler, though the Turbine was never actually marketed.

In Japan, promotional models from the late 1950s until the 1970s were typically cast in pot metal and given a chrome or gold finish; they typically doubled as cigarette holders and ash trays.

=== The plastic promo ===

About the time Banthrico was declining as a promotional maker, two companies, PMC and Ideal Models (later to become Jo-Han) were introducing plastic promotional models to the public. Similar to metal model producer Banthrico, PMC also made many in the form of banks. Many Chevrolet bank models had the inscription on the bottom &quot;To help save for a rainy day, or to buy a new Chevrolet.&quot; The scale for these cars was 1:25, however a few Chevrolets and Plymouths were produced in a larger 1:20 scale. Other less well known plastic companies like Lincoln Line, Cruver or Burd Manufacturing, made the occasional promotional model though cars may not have been the company&#x27;s specialty.

AMT began producing assembled 1/25 friction and coaster models in 1948. These were mostly promotional models manufactured for automobile dealers. Youngsters would be given the scale models to play with while the parents and the salesman haggled. Collecting and trading these &quot;promos&quot; soon became a popular hobby. AMT soon took control of SMP, another plastic promotional model producer. By 1960, Wisconsin-based PMC ceased to produce promo models, though continued to make toys.

Interest in the hobby peaked during the 1950s and 1960s, with AMT, Jo-Han, and Model Products Corporation (MPC) as the primary promotional manufacturers.

Throughout, the promo producers were at the whim of the real automakers and would respond to requests of particular scales, paint colors, and other details like working suspensions or even, on occasion, detailed engines, or other opening features.

=== American promo details ===

These plastic models were intricately detailed, with body scripts, trim, and emblems, as well as dashboard details, exact duplicates of the real thing, in 1/25 scale. Typically, each automaker would license their cars to one or more model companies. Sometimes the contracts seemed piecemeal – for example in 1965, Chrysler had promos made by AMT, Jo-Han, and MPC. But often one of the BIG 3 favored a particular model maker. For example, Jo-Han produced most Chrysler products and Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles from GM, while AMT did the Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac, and Fords. American Motors Corporation shared promotional duties between Jo-Han and AMT depending on the year. Also, contracts sometimes changed between companies for similar models almost on an annual basis. For example, Jo-Han uncharacteristically produced the 1972 Ford Torino, and MPC did full-size Chevrolets in the early and mid-1970s. While Jo-Han did Chrysler early on, MPC took on the pentastar in the mid-1970s. 1968 through 1970 Chevy Impala kits were made by both MPC and AMT, as were some Camaros. Trying to beat competition to market, sometimes a model company would make a &#x27;guess&#x27; at a particular model for a member of the Big 3 for a particular year and thus get details wrong.

=== Marketing approaches ===

Commercial versions of the promos were also marketed and sold in retail stores like Zayre and Murphy USA from the early 1960s, up until around 1973. Differences from dealer promos were lack of manufacturer&#x27;s official paint schemes and often the addition of a friction motor located on the front axle, noticeable by the studded white vinyl gear that protruded around the axle (and through the oil pan). However, they were painted and looked just as attractive as dealer promos.

Some model companies sold unassembled versions of the promo cars, that were typically simpler and easier to assemble than the annual kits (with engine and customizing parts available in the full-blown kits left out). They were molded in color (instead of the traditional white) and easily assembled without glue (thus no glue or paint was required). When assembled these were almost identical to the much more elite promotional models. What usually gives them away is that they were mostly molded in a brighter nonmetallic color without paint matched to official &#x27;Big 3&#x27; colors. AMT&#x27;s &quot;Craftsman&quot; series of promo-like models had perforations in the bodies for mirrors and antennae – thus the model&#x27;s final appearance was not precisely like a promo (which would have had no custom parts attached to the body of the car). Probably, because of the promo look, however, today these often command higher prices than the detailed &quot;3-in-1&quot; kits, especially AMT&#x27;s Craftsman series of the early and mid sixties.

After being owned for a time by Seville Enterprises, Okey Spaulding purchased once-defunct Jo-Han, which produced a few of its original Jo-Han models in limited quantities. These include the 1963 Chrysler Turbine Car, 1959 Rambler station wagon, and some of its original 1950s Oldsmobiles and Plymouths. However, he has had financial problems from the start, and there are no indications that he will be able to continue to produce the highly desired Johan line of models.

===European promotionals===

With the exception of some firms like Stahlberg which made larger scale plastic promotional models of Swedish Volvos and Saabs in an American style, European promotionals were usually based on the 1:43 or 1:32 scale diecast metal models produced as toys or collectors items, often brightly colored or with authentic tampo or silk screen liveries for commercial products. Companies commonly making promotionals in Europe have been NZG Models, Conrad Models, Gescha in Germany and Tekno and Emek Muovi in Denmark and Finland, respectively. Tekno was one of the first European companies to offer a wide variety of multiple promotional variations. Almost all European toy model brands had some kind of promotional service, but in Germany, 1:50 scale was, and remains very common for trucks. In the United States, such diecast companies are rare, but Winross Models and Pennjoy are a couple of European style examples which have had much success, particularly Winross which has been making models since the early 1960s.

Another variation on promotionals were whole toy lines or brands constructed to represent vehicles on display at particular automotive museums. Examples were Cursor Models of Germany which made models specifically on display in the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Sindelfingen, R.A.M.I. by J.M.K. of France which made vehicles in the Automobile Museum de Rochetaillée sur Saône in France, or also Dugu Miniautotoys of Italy which made vehicles for the classic automobile museum in Turin.

==Model kits==

Scale miniatures of real production vehicles, designed as kits for children or the enthusiast to construct, can be made of plastic, die-cast metal, resin, and even wood. In plastic model kits, parts are molded in single cast &#x27;trees&#x27; with thin connections that can be easily severed for painting and assembly. Parts come molded in a variety of colors, white being the most common in the 1960s and 1970s. Some parts are chrome plated to simulate real bumpers, grilles, wheels, and other pieces that might be chrome on the actual vehicle. Tires are most commonly molded in rubber. Water &#x27;slide-on&#x27; decals are usually included along with an instruction brochure.

The best kits have incredible levels of accuracy, even in detail and parts unseen when the model is complete. Major manufacturers are AMT, MPC, Revell, Monogram, and Tamiya but many smaller plastics companies, like Aurora, Pyro, IMC, and Premier have come and gone.

=== Pioneers ===

The model car &quot;kit&quot; hobby began in the post World War II era with Ace and Berkeley wooden model cars. Revell pioneered the plastic model car in the late 1940s with their Maxwell kit, which was basically an unassembled version of a pull toy. Derek Brand, from England, pioneered the first real plastic kit, a 1932 Ford Roadster for Revell. He was also known for developing a line of 1/32 scale model car kits in England for the Gowland brothers. These kits were later introduced by Revell in the U.S. as the &quot;Highway Pioneers&quot; Series of kits.

On the heels of the promotional model business, Aluminum Model Toys or AMT introduced model car kits in 1957. Jo-Han, Revell and Monogram also started producing model car kits about this same time. Most of these were known as &quot;annual&quot; kits, and were the unassembled kit version of the promotional models or &#x27;promos&#x27; representing the new cars that were introduced at the beginning of each model year. As early as 1962, avid British collector Cecil Gibson had even written a book on plastic model cars. By the mid-1960s, plastic model kits had become more plentiful and varied, with increased level of detail. Typically, the kits often had opening hoods, separate engines and detailed suspension parts.

=== Customizers ===

The mid-1960s is generally considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of plastic model car kits. Many specialty modelers and customizers, famous for their wild creations, were hired by model companies to sponsor and create new kit designs. George Barris, Darryl Starbird, and the Alexander Brothers worked for AMT. Tom Daniel design vehicles for Monogram and Mattel. Dean Jeffries was employed by MPC. Bill Campbell created hippie monster designs for Hawk. Ed Roth, famous for his &#x27;Rat Fink&#x27; was hired by Revell about 1962. Many of these customizers created real cars and had to have specialists convert their creations into model kit form. Jim Keeler, a model kit designer for Revell, brought the world highly detailed model cars in the early sixties and is credited with bringing Ed Roth&#x27;s famous hot rods and customs to the model car marketplace. He also designed Revell&#x27;s Custom Car Parts which allowed kit builders to add engines, custom wheels and other custom features to existing models. Keeler later went on to Aurora Plastics and innovated the Prehistoric Scenes, which were highly detailed models of prehistoric dinosaurs. Many of Keelers kit designs are still being sold in the 21st century.

In addition to building them stock, most annual kits offered &quot;3 in 1&quot; versions which allowed the builder to assemble the car in stock, custom, or racing form. MPC joined the kit/promo business in 1965, and among their first annual kits/promos, was the full-size Dodge Monaco, which was released with a gold metallic plastic body and is a valuable collector&#x27;s item today.

=== Decline and revival ===

Interest in model car kits began to wane in the mid-1970s, and while the precise causes are not perfectly clear, some factors were a sharp rise in the price of plastics, parents becoming cautious of &#x27;glue sniffing&#x27; and, later, the rise of video gaming. A revival of sorts was seen in the late 1980s, especially among adults, as Monogram introduced a series of replicas of NASCAR race cars, as did AMT with a kit of the 1966 Chevrolet Nova, which American modelers had been requesting for years. New model specific magazines sprang up, such as &quot;Scale Auto Enthusiast&quot;, (now simply &quot;Scale Auto&quot;) and &quot;Model Cars Magazine!&quot;. These magazines spread the word, helped advertisers, and brought a new generation of modelers together from all across the country.

Many of the kits from the golden age of modeling have been reissued. Not only does this allow the craftsman to build the cars they always wanted (but couldn&#x27;t obtain or afford), but it tends to lower the prices of the originals. In some cases, models of cars from the 1950s and 1960s have been issued with all-new tooling, which allows for even more detailing with modern kit design and manufacturing methods. These include AMT&#x27;s 1966 Fairlane and 1967 Impala SS, and Monogram&#x27;s 1967 Chevelle and 1965 Impala Super Sport.

Today, model car companies are still in business, fueled by this renewed interest. ERTL took over AMT and MPC which are now both under the Round 2 LLC name. Revell and Monogram have merged. Modelers today can take advantage of modern technology, which includes photoetched details, adhesive chrome foil for chrome trim, wiring for engines, and billet-aluminum parts. Many builders today can construct a model so it resembles the real car in miniature, much more than could have been done with essentially the same kit more than forty years ago.

The internet has also fueled a growing modeling community through websites, online forums and bulletin boards, and sites that host photographs, allowing the hobby to expand internationally.

=== Japanese kits ===

Japanese model kit manufacturers – Tamiya, Fujimi, Aoshima, and Hasegawa, among them – also stepped up their presence in the U.S. market during the 1980s and 1990s. Lesser known kit manufacturers, at least in the United States, were Doyusha, Yamada, Nichimo, Otaki, Marui, Rosso, and Arii. Japanese kits are generally known for being ultra detailed and of very high quality. Most of the subjects of these companies are Japanese cars, both classic and current (and, of course, ships, planes and military vehicles). For example, Hasegawa and Aoshima make detailed models of the first-generation Toyota Celica, which has become somewhat of a classic. Nevertheless, Hasegawa also produced 1/25 scale models of 1965–66 American cars, including the 1965 Chevrolet Impala, and 1966 Buick Wildcat, Cadillac Coupe DeVille, and Thunderbird Landau. These were actually Johan and AMT kits that were simplified and modified for the Japanese market.

=== Short-run multimedia kits ===

Since the mid-1990s several companies including: Tameo, Studio 27, Model Factory Hiro, and Renaissance have issued hundreds of Sports Car and Formula 1 subjects in limited-run, multimedia kit sets. These so-called &quot;multimedia&quot; offerings consist of a combination of resin, white metal, photo-etch, and machined aluminum instead of inject plastic parts. The most popular scales are 1/43, 1/20, and 1/24. These multimedia kits are very high quality, require a wide set of construction skills to complete, and are marketed to international competition enthusiasts.

==Powered models==

Though most car models are static display items, individual model builders have sometimes powered their vehicles in various ways, including rubber bands, springs, inertia mechanisms, electric motors, internal combustion engines, air engines and steam engines. In order to make them less fragile, powered models are often somewhat simplified and not as detailed as the best static models. For this reason, some modelers dismiss nearly all powered miniature cars as toys; however many individual efforts and commercial products are sufficiently well-scaled and detailed that they deserve to be called models. The main types of commercially produced powered car models include:

Uncontrolled powered models, which were developed in the 1930s and were common until the 1960s. Often guided by a rail between the wheels, or by a tether staked to the center of a circular course, most of these cars use small internal combustion glow plug engines and are known as tether cars.

Electrically powered slot cars which draw power from the track. They became extremely popular in the 1960s, but commercial slot car racing experienced a rapid decline in popularity late in the decade. By the end of the 1970s, the slot car hobby had diminished significantly, especially public tracks operating larger scale cars, and modeling in general was on the decline (HO Slot Car Racing 1999–2011). One website attributes the weakening of the pastime to both the ageing of the baby-boomers along with the fragile economics of the slot car industry and the closing of many commercial slot car tracks perhaps as toy companies offered smaller sets to be used at home. A wide variety of electrically powered vehicles, however are available today – in various forms.

Battery powered model cars are also available. They exist in versions with or without remote control and are common toys.

Spring-powered or &quot;clockwork&quot; car models, that are wound with a key or by a friction mechanism. These were common until slot cars largely replaced them in the 1960s. In fact, the first commercially successful slot cars, the Scalextric 1/32 line (originally 1:30) which debuted in 1957, were simply motorized versions of the earlier Scalex clockwork racers.

Radio-controlled cars, which can be bought assembled or built from kits. These are usually powered by electric motors or glow plug engines. Drivers can control the speed and steering of these cars remotely by a radio signal.

Combustion engine powered model cars are expensive and usually remote controllable. As combustion engines have a significant danger such cars are not suitable for children. Combustion engine powered model cars are often used for races.

<text>In Norse mythology, Göndul (Old Norse: &quot;Gǫndul&quot;, &quot;wand-wielder&quot;) is a valkyrie. Göndul is attested in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;, and a 14th-century Norwegian charm. In addition, Göndul appears within the valkyrie list in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, in both of the two &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; lists found in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and among the valkyries listed in &quot;Darraðarljóð&quot;.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to &quot;choose among the kings&#x27; kinsmen&quot; and decide who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning &quot;Skögul&#x27;s-stormblast&quot; for &quot;battle&quot;. Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that &quot;groweth now the gods&#x27; following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads.&quot; Haakon hears &quot;what the valkyries said,&quot; and the valkyries are described as sitting &quot;high-hearted on horseback,&quot; wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:

:&quot;Hákon said:&quot;
:&quot;Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?&quot;
:&quot;Skogul said:&quot;
:&quot;&#x27;Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled.&quot;

Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the &quot;green homes of the godheads&quot; to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the Einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.

===&quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;===
In &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;, a short late 14th century narrative from a later and extended version of the &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot; found in the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; manuscript, a figure by the name of Göndul appears and instigates the meeting of the kings Hedinn of Serkland and Hogni of Denmark and, by means of seduction and a memory-altering draught, provokes a war between the two.

In the work (chapter 5), Hedinn and his household enter a wood in his realm. Hedinn is separated from his men and enters a clearing. He sees a tall, beautiful woman sitting on a chair, and he asks her what her name is, and the woman replies that her name is Göndul. The two talk, and she asks him of his great deeds. He tells her of his deeds and asks her if she knows of any king who is his equal in accomplishments and stature. She says that she knows of one named Hogni of Denmark, who also rules over no less than twenty kings. Hedinn says that they two must compete to find which is better. Göndul comments that Hedinn should now go back to his men, for they are searching for him:

:&quot;Then whot I,&quot; said Hedinn, &quot;that we shall try it which of us twain is foremost.&quot;
:&quot;Now will it be time for thee to go to thy men,&quot; said Gondul; &quot;they will be seeking thee.&quot;

In chapter 6, Hedinn travels with his men to meet Hogni in Denmark and there the two test their skills in swimming, archery, fencing and by other means and find their skills to be evenly matched. The two make an oath of brotherhood and halve all their possessions between themselves. Hogni soon leaves to go warring and Hedinn stays behind to guard their combined realm. 

On a day with beautiful weather, Hedinn goes for a walk in the woods and, like back in Serkland, loses his men and finds himself in an open meadow. In the lawn sits the same woman, Göndul, in the same chair, and yet she seems more beautiful than before. His heart yearns for her. In her hand she holds a drinking horn, shut with a lid, and she tells the king to drink. Hedinn is thirsty from the heat, and drinks from the horn. The drink causes Hedinn to forget his oath of brotherhood with Hogni.

Göndul asks if Hedinn has tried his prowess against that of Hogni, as she had suggested. Hedinn says that he has done this and that, indeed, they found themselves to be equal. Göndul says that he is mistaken, they are not equal at all. Hogni asks her what she means, and she responds that he no bride, yet Hogni has a noble wife. Hedinn says that he will marry Hogni&#x27;s daughter Hildr, and that Hogni will surely approve. Göndul replies that it would be more glorious for Hedinn to take Hildr and to slay Hogni&#x27;s bride, specifically by placing her on a ship and then to kill her before launching it. Influenced by the draught he drank, Hedinn leaves with only this plan in mind.

After Hedinn has executed the plan as Göndul suggested, he returns alone to the wood in Serkland and again sees Göndul sitting in the same chair. The two greet one another and Hedinn tells her that he has completed the plot. With this she is pleased. She again gives him the horn, from which he again drinks, yet this time he falls asleep in her lap. Göndul draws away from his head and says &quot;Now hallow I thee, and give thee to lie under all those spells and the weird that Odin commanded, thee and Hogni, and all the hosts of you.&quot;

Hedinn wakes up and sees the ghostly shadow of Göndul. She has become black and huge, and he remembers everything. Great woe comes over him.

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A witchcraft trial in Bergen, Norway held in 1324 resulted in the recording of a spell used by the witch Ragnhild Tregagás to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of Göndul being &quot;sent out&quot;:

:I send out from me the spirits of (the valkyrie) Gondul.
:May the first bite you in the back.
:May the second bite you in the breast.
:May the third turn hate and envy upon you.
==Theories==
Rudolf Simek says that the name &quot;Göndul&quot; is etymologically rooted in Old Norse &quot;gandr&quot; (meaning &quot;magic, magic wand&quot;), yet in the Norwegian &#x27;Göndul charm&#x27; it appears to mean &quot;magical animal; werewolf?&quot;, and that, whatever the case, the name &quot;awakens magical associations which certainly are connected with the function of the Valkyries as directors of human fate.&quot;

<text>In Norse mythology, Hildr (Old Norse &quot;battle&quot;) is a valkyrie. Hildr is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; as Högni&#x27;s daughter and Hedin&#x27;s wife in the &quot;Hjaðningavíg&quot;. She had the power to revive the dead in battlefields and used it to maintain the everlasting battle between Hedin and Högni.

Hildr is also mentioned along with other valkyries in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Darraðarljóð&quot; and other Old Norse poems. The Old Norse word &quot;hildr&quot; is a common noun meaning &quot;battle&quot; and it is not always clear when the poets had the valkyrie in mind, as a personification of battle.

<text>Sigrún (Old Norse &quot;victory rune&quot;) is a valkyrie in Norse mythology. Her story is related in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot; and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The original editor annotated that she was Sváfa reborn.

The hero Helgi Hundingsbane first meets her when she leads a band of nine Valkyries:

The two fall in love, and Sigrún tells Helgi that her father Högni has promised her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmarr. Helgi invades Granmar&#x27;s kingdom and slays anyone opposing their relationship. Only Sigrún&#x27;s brother Dagr is left alive on condition that he swears fealty to Helgi.

Dagr is however obliged by honour to avenge his brothers and after having summoned Odin, the god gives him a spear. In a place called Fjoturlund, Dagr kills Helgi and goes back to his sister to tell her of his deed. Sigrún puts Dagr under a powerful curse after which he is obliged to live on carrion in the woods.

Helgi is put in a barrow, but returns from Valhalla one last time so that the two can spend a night together.

Sigrún dies early from sadness, but is reborn as a Valkyrie. In the next life, she is Kára and Helgi is Helgi Haddingjaskati, whose story is related in &quot;Hrómundar saga Gripssonar&quot;.

==Modern influence==
Sigrún appeared in the 2018 video game God of War, in which she is the Valkyrie Queen. She can be fought by the player after defeating eight other Valkyries. Her fight is considered to be one of the most difficult and demanding encounters in the franchise.

In 2022, she also appeared in God of War Ragnarök. But this time, she was an ally with Kratos, Freya, Mimir, Atreus and the shield maidens—her sisters. She and the other eight Valkyries, her sisters, are now free of the corruption spells of Odin thanks to the events which happened in God of War.

In the series The Dresden Files, Sigrun, more commonly referred to as &quot;Gard&quot;, is a warrior in the service of Monoc Securities, headed by Donar Vadderung. Vaddering is a being who is also Odin and Santa Claus.

<doc id="87127" wikidata="Q850506" url="?curid=87127" title="Brunhild">
<text>Brunhild, also known as Brunhilda or Brynhild ( , , or ), is a female character from Germanic heroic legend. She may have her origins in the Visigothic princess and queen Brunhilda of Austrasia.

In the Norse tradition, Brunhild is a shieldmaiden or valkyrie, who appears as a main character in the and some Eddic poems treating the same events. In the continental Germanic tradition, where she is a central character in the , she is a powerful Amazon-like queen. In both traditions, she is instrumental in bringing about the death of the hero Sigurd or Siegfried after he deceives her into marrying the Burgundian king Gunther or Gunnar. In both traditions, the immediate cause for her desire to have Siegfried murdered is a quarrel with the hero&#x27;s wife, Gudrun or Kriemhild. In the Scandinavian tradition, but not in the continental tradition, Brunhild kills herself after Sigurd&#x27;s death.

Richard Wagner made Brunhild (as ) an important character in his opera cycle . The majority of modern conceptions of the figure have been inspired or influenced by Wagner&#x27;s depiction.

Brunhild has been called &quot;the paramount figure of Germanic legend.&quot; The introduces her by saying:
== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Brunhild&quot; in its various forms is derived from the equivalents of Old High German (armor) and (conflict). The name is first attested in the sixth century, for the historical Brunhilda of Austrasia, as .

In the context of the heroic tradition, the first element of her name may be connected to Brunhild&#x27;s role as a shieldmaiden. In the Eddic poem , the valkyrie from is identified with Brunhild. This name consists of the elements and and can be translated as &quot;driver to victory&quot;. It could simply be a synonym for valkyrie.

== Origins ==

The most popular theory about the origins of the legendary Brunhild is that she originates from two historical figures of the Merovingian dynasty: Brunhilda of Austrasia, a Visigothic princess who married the Frankish king Sigebert I, and Fredegund, who was married to Sigebert&#x27;s brother Chilperic I. Frankish historian Gregory of Tours blames Fredegund for Sigebert&#x27;s murder in 575, after which Fredegund and Brunhild carried on a feud that lasted until 613, when Chilperic&#x27;s son Chlothar II captured and killed her. If this theory is correct, then Brunhild has essentially taken the role of Fredegund in the Nibelungen story while maintaining Brunhilda of Austrasia&#x27;s name.

A less widely accepted theory locates the origins of the Brunhild figure in the story of the Ostrogothic general Uraias. Uraias&#x27;s wife insulted the wife of the Ostrogothic king Ildibad, and the king&#x27;s wife then had Uraias murdered.

== Scandinavian traditions and attestations ==

Brunhild was a popular figure in Scandinavia, with traditions about her firmly attested around 1220 with the composition of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. The Scandinavian tradition about Brunhild shows knowledge of the continental Germanic traditions as well.

=== Prose Edda ===

The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson is the earliest attestation of the Scandinavian version of Brunhild&#x27;s life, dating to around 1220. Snorri tells the story of Brunhild in several chapters of the section of the poem called &quot;Skáldskaparsmál&quot;. His presentation of the story is very similar to that found in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; (see below), but is considerably shorter.

After Sigurd kills the dragon Fafnir, he rides up to a house on a mountain, inside of which he finds a woman sleeping wearing armor. He cuts the armor from her, and she wakes up, and says that she was a valkyrie named Hild, but called Brunhild. Sigurd then rides away.

Later, Sigurd brings Gunnar to Brunhild&#x27;s brother Atli to ask for Brunhild&#x27;s hand in marriage. Brunhild lives on a mountain called Hindarfjall, where she is surrounded by a wall of flame. Atli tells them that Brunhild will only marry a man who rides through the flame. Gunnar is unable to do this, and Sigurd switches shapes with him, riding through the flames. Sigurd then weds Brunhild as Gunnar, but places a sword between the two of them on their wedding night. The next morning, he gives Brunhild a ring from the hoard of the Nibelungen, and Brunhild gives him a ring in return. Gunnar and Sigurd then return to their own shapes and return to the court of Gunnar&#x27;s father Gjuki.

Some time later, Brunhild and Gudrun quarrel while washing their hair in the river. Brunhild says that she does not want the water that passes through Gudrun&#x27;s hair to touch her own, because her husband Gunnar is braver. Gudrun replies with Sigurd&#x27;s deeds of killing the dragon, but Brunhild says that only Gunnar had dared to ride through the wall of flame. Then Gudrun reveals to Brunhild that Sigurd was the one who rode through the wall, producing Brunhild&#x27;s ring as proof. Brunhild then encourages Gunnar to kill Sigurd, which eventually he does. Once Sigurd is dead, Brunhild kills herself, and is burned on the same pyre as Sigurd. It is possible that Snorri&#x27;s account of the quarrel between Brunhild and Gudrun derives from a lost Eddic poem.

=== Poetic Edda ===

The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a collection of heroic and mythological Nordic poems, appears to have been compiled around 1270 in Iceland, and assembles mythological and heroic songs of various ages. A large number of poems deal with the relationship between Sigurd and Brunhild, which seems to have been of special interest to the compiler.

Generally, none of the poems in the collection is thought to be older than 900 AD and some appear to have been written in the thirteenth century. It is also possible that apparently old poems have been written in an archaicizing style and that apparently recent poems are reworkings of older material, so that reliable dating is impossible. Much of the Brunhild material is taken to have a relatively recent origin.

==== Grípisspá ====

In &quot;Grípisspá&quot;, Sigurd receives a prophecy of his life from his uncle Grípir. Among the prophesied actions are that he will awaken a valkyrie who will teach him the runes. Later, he will betroth himself to Brunhild at the court of Heimir. He will marry Gudrun but then aid Gunnar in wooing Brunhild, marrying but not sleeping with her. She, however, will later accuse Sigurd of taking her virginity and have him killed.

The poem appears to distinguish between Sigrdrífa in the following &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; and Brunhild as two different women. It also seems to identify Sigrdrífa with the valkyrie Sigrún from the preceding poems in the &quot;Edda&quot; about Helgi Hundingsbane.

It is generally taken to be a late poem that was written on the basis of the other poems about Sigurd&#x27;s life.

==== Fáfnismál ====

In &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, once Sigurd has tasted the blood of the dragon Fafnir, Sigurd understands the birds who tell him to go to a palace where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa sleeps surrounded by flames.

==== Sigrdrífumál ====

In &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, Sigurd rides to the mountain Hindarfjall, where he sees a wall of shields that surround a sleeping woman. The woman is wearing armor that seems to have grown into her skin, and Sigurd uses his sword to cut it open. This awakens the maiden, who explains that she is the valkyrie Sigrdrífa and, in a prose interlude, tells how she had disobeyed Odin who then demanded she marry. She refused and said she would only marry a man without fear. She proceeds to teach Sigurd wisdom and the runes.

The condition that Sigrdrífa will only marry a man without fear is the same as Brunhild will later make, perhaps pointing to the two figures originally being identical.

==== Brot af Sigurðarkviðu ====

&quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot; is only preserved fragmentarily: the surviving part of the poem tells the story of Sigurd&#x27;s murder. Brunhild has evidently accused Sigurd of having slept with her, and this has caused Gunnar and Högni to have their half-brother Guthorm kill Sigurd. Once Sigurd has been murdered, Brunhild rejoices before admitting to Gunnar that Sigurd never slept with her.

==== Guðrúnarkviða I ====

In &quot;Guðrúnarkviða I&quot;, Brunhild briefly appears while Gudrun mourns the death of Sigurd. Brunhild defends herself against the accusation that she is responsible for Sigurd&#x27;s death and accuses her brother Atli of responsibility. In a prose section at the close of the poem, Brunhild commits suicide with several slaves.

The dialogue between Brunhild and Gudrun is characterized by immense hostility, and Brunhild is portrayed as evil.

==== Sigurðarkviða hin skamma ====

&quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; repeats the story of Sigurd once again. Sigurd wins Brunhild for Gunnar and weds her for him, but the two do not sleep together. Brunhild desires Sigurd, however, and decides to have him killed since she cannot have him. She threatens to leave Gunnar if he does not kill Sigurd, and he agrees. Once Sigurd is dead, Gudrun breaks into a lament, and Brunhild laughs loudly. Gunnar chastises her for this, whereupon Brunhild explains that she never wanted to marry Gunnar and had been forced to by her brother Atli. She had then secretly betrothed herself to Sigurd. Brunhild then gives away all her possessions and kills herself, despite Gunnar&#x27;s attempts to convince her not to. As she dies, she prophesies the future misfortunes of Gudrun and Gunnar. Finally, she asks to be burned on the same pyre as Sigurd.

Although the title indicates the poem is about Sigurd, the majority of the poem is actually concerned with Brunhild, who justifies her actions. The song is generally thought to be a recent composition.

==== Helreið Brynhildar ====

At the beginning of &quot;Helreið Brynhildar&quot;, Brunhild&#x27;s corpse is burned and she begins her journey to the Hel, the Scandinavian underworld. On her way, she encounters a giant who accuses her of having blood on her hands. In response, Brunhild tells the story of her life, defending herself and justifying her actions. She accuses the Burgundians of having deceived her. Brunhild hopes to spend the afterlife together with Sigurd.

As Brunhild narrates her life, she is clearly identified with the valkyrie Sigrdrífa and combines the story of Sigrdrífa&#x27;s awakening with Sigurd&#x27;s wooing for Gunnar as a single event. Odin himself is portrayed as requiring that only a man who knows no fear could awaken her. The song portrays Brunhild as a victim and she achieves a sort of apotheosis at the end.

=== Völsunga saga ===

The &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; tells the fullest version of Brunhild&#x27;s life in the Scandinavian tradition, explaining many unclear references found in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. It follows the plot given in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; fairly closely, although there is no indication that the author knew the other text. The author appears to have been working in Norway and to have known the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; (c. 1250), a translation of continental Germanic traditions into Old Norse (see ). Therefore, the &quot;Völsunga Saga&quot; is dated to sometime in the second half of the thirteenth century. The saga is connected to a second saga, &quot;Ragnars saga Loðbrókar&quot;, which follows it in the manuscript, by having Ragnar Lodbrok marry Aslaug, daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild.

According to the saga, Brunhild is the daughter of Budli and the sister of Atli. She is raised at a place called Hlymdalir by her King Heimir, who is married to her sister Bekkhild. At Hlymdalir she is known as &quot;Hild under the helmet&quot; (&quot;Hildr und hjálmi&quot;) and is raised to be a shieldmaiden or valkyrie. When she is twelve years old, King Agnar steals Brunhild&#x27;s magical swan shirt, and she is forced to swear an oath of loyalty to him. This causes her to intervene on Angar&#x27;s behalf when he is fighting Hjálmgunnar, despite Odin&#x27;s desire for Hjálmgunnar to win. As punishment, Odin stuck her with a sleep thorn and declared that she must marry. She swore that she would not awaken to marry unless a man came who knew no fear. Odin places the sleeping Brunhild on mount Hindarfjall and surrounds her with a wall of shields.

Eventually, Sigurd comes and awakens Brunhild. She makes foreboding prophecies and imparts wisdom to him. The two promise to marry each other. After this, Brunhild returns to Heimir. One day while Sigurd is hunting, his hawk flies up and lands at the window of the tower where Brunhild is living. Sigurd feels love when he sees her and, despite her insistence she wants only to fight as a warrior, convinces her to renew her vow to marry him. Meanwhile, Gudrun has had a foreboding dream and goes to Brunhild to have her interpret it. Brunhild tells Gudrun all of the misfortune that will befall her.

Soon afterward, Gunnar, Gudrun&#x27;s brother, decides to woo Brunhild to be his wife. Sigurd, who has married Gudrun after having been given a potion to forget his previous vows to Brunhild, aids him. Brunhild can only be wed by a man who will ride through the flames around her tower; Gunnar is unable to do this, so Sigurd takes his shape and performs the deed for him. While Brunhild is reluctant to marry Gunnar, Sigurd in his disguise reminds her of her vow to marry the man who can cross the flames. The two then wed and Sigurd places his sword between them for three nights while they share the marriage bed. Sigurd and Gunnar return to their normal shapes and take Brunhild back to Gunnar&#x27;s hall.

One day, Brunhild and Gudrun are bathing at a river; Brunhild declares that she should not have to use the same water as Gudrun, as her husband is the more important man. Gudrun then reveals that Sigurd had crossed the flames and not Gunnar, and shows a ring that Sigurd had taken from Brunhild and given to her. The next day, the queens continue their quarrel in the king&#x27;s hall. Brunhild is so full of pain that she takes to bed. She demands vengeance against Sigurd, despite Gunnar&#x27;s attempts to pacify her. Sigurd comes and confesses his love for her, offering to leave Gudrun to be with her, but Brunhild refuses. Afterwards, she demands that Gunnar kill Sigurd. Once the deed is done, Brunhild laughs loudly when she hears Gudrun&#x27;s cry of lament. She reveals that she had slandered Sigurd by claiming that he had slept with her. She then stabs herself, and while dying holds a long conversation with Gunnar in which she prophesies the future. According to her wish, she is burned on the same pyre as Sigurd.

=== Ballads ===

Brunhild lived on as a character in several late medieval and early modern Scandinavian ballads. These often have sources both from the Scandinavian tradition and from the continental tradition, either via the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; or directly from German sources.

In the Danish ballad &quot;Sivard og Brynild&quot; (DgF 3, TSB E 101), Sigurd wins Brunhild on the &quot;glass mountain&quot; and then gives her to his friend Hagen. One day, Brunhild fights with Sigurd&#x27;s wife Signild, and Signild shows Brunhild a ring that Brunhild had given Sigurd as a love gift. Brynhild then tells Hagen to kill Sigurd, and Hagen does this by first borrowing Sigurd&#x27;s sword then killing him with it. He then shows Brunhild Sigurd&#x27;s head and kills her too when she offers him her love.

A ballad from the Faroe Islands, &quot;Brynhildar táttur&quot; (the song of Brynhild, TSB E 100), also tells a version of the story of Brunhild. The original form of this ballad likely dates to the fourteenth century, though it is clear that many variants have been influenced by the Danish ballads. In the ballad, Brunhild refuses all suitors; she will only marry Sigurd. To attract him, she tells her father Budli to create a hall with a wall of fire around her. One day, Gunnar comes and sues for her hand, but she refuses. Then Sigurd comes, breaks through the wall of fire, and they sleep together. When he leaves, however, Gudrun and her mother Grimhild cast a spell on Sigurd so that he forgets Brunhild and marries Gudrun. Some time later Brunhild and Gudrun argue in the bath, with Gudrun refusing to share water with Brunhild. She reminds Brunhild that Sigurd took her virginity, whereupon Brunhild tells Högni (or in some versions, Gunnar) to kill Sigurd. Budli tries unsuccessfully to change his daughter&#x27;s mind; once Sigurd is dead, Brunhild collapses in grief.

== Continental Germanic traditions and attestations ==

The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; (c. 1200) represents the first attestation of Brunhild in either the continental or Scandinavian traditions. The German Brunhild was nevertheless still associated with Scandinavia, as shown by her kingdom being located on &quot;Island&quot; (Iceland). It has been suggested that this may show knowledge of Norse traditions about Brunhild. In general, the literature that attests the continental tradition shows far less interest in Brunhild than the surviving Scandinavian material.

=== Nibelungenlied ===

In the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, Brunhild is first presented as the ruling queen of &quot;Îsland&quot; (Iceland) from her castle of &quot;Îsenstein&quot; (iron-stone). Some manuscripts spell the name of her kingdom &quot;Îsenlant&quot; (iron-land), and it is possible that this is the original form, with the association with Iceland being secondary. Her kingdom is twelve days journey by boat from the Burgundian capital of Worms, marking her as living outside the bounds of courtly society.

Brunhild is introduced to the story when word of her immense beauty reaches Worms one day, and King Gunther decides he wishes to marry her. Siegfried, who is familiar with Brunhild, advises him against this marriage, but Gunther convinces Siegfried to help him woo Brunhild by promising to let Siegfried marry Gunther&#x27;s sister Kriemhild. Gunther needs Siegfried&#x27;s help because Brunhild has set a series of three feats of strength that any suitor for her hand must complete; should the suitor fail any one of these feats, she will kill him. Siegfried agrees to help Gunther by using his cloak of invisibility (&quot;Tarnkappe&quot;) to aid Gunther during the challenges, while Gunther will simply pretend to accomplish them himself. He and Gunther agree that Siegfried will claim to be Gunther&#x27;s vassal during the wooing.

When Siegfried and Gunther arrive at Isenstein, Brunhild initially assumes that Siegfried is the suitor, but immediately loses interest in him once he claims that he is Gunther&#x27;s vassal. With Siegfried&#x27;s help, Gunther is able to accomplish all the feats of strength; although Brunhild initially looks like she might renege on the agreement, Siegfried quickly gathers his men from his kingdom in Nibelungenland and brings them to Isenstein. Gunther and Brunhild then agree to marry. The heroes return to Worms with Brunhild, and Siegfried marries Kriemhild at the same time that Brunhild marries Gunther. Brunhild cries seeing this however, believing that the royal princess Kriemhild has been married to a vassal. On her wedding night, when Gunther attempts to sleep with Brunhild, Brunhild quickly overpowers Gunther, tying him up by his hands and feet with her belt and leaving him hanging on a hook until morning. Gunther is forced to rely on Siegfried again, who takes Gunther&#x27;s shape using his &quot;Tarnkappe&quot; and is only able to subdue Brunhild due to the &quot;Tarnkappe&quot; granting him the strength of twelve men. Gunther is secretly present during all of this, and is able to confirm that Siegfried did not sleep with Brunhild. Once Siegfried has subdued Brunhild, Gunther takes Siegfried&#x27;s place and takes Brunhild&#x27;s virginity, which results in the loss of her superhuman strength. As a trophy, Siegfried takes Brunhild&#x27;s ring and belt, which he later gives to Kriemhild.

It is mentioned that Brunhild and Gunther have a son, whom they name Siegfried. Some years later, Brunhild, still disturbed by Siegfried&#x27;s failure to behave as a vassal, convinces Gunther to invite Siegfried and Kriemhild to Worms. Once the guests arrive, Brunhild becomes increasingly insistent that her husband is superior to Kriemhild&#x27;s. This culminates when the two queens encounter each other in front of the cathedral at Worms, and fight over who has the right to enter first. Brunhild declares that Kriemhild is the wife of a vassal, to which Kriemhild replies that Siegfried has taken Brunhild&#x27;s virginity, showing her the belt and ring as proof. Brunhild bursts into tears and Kriemhild enters the church before her. Brunhild then goes to Gunther and Gunther forces Siegfried to confirm that this is not the case. However, Brunhild convinces Gunther to murder Siegfried nonetheless. The deed itself is carried out by the Burgundian vassal Hagen, who justifies his action with the sorrow that Siegfried has caused Brunhild.

After this point, Brunhild plays no further role in the story. She is shown to be glad at Kriemhild&#x27;s suffering, and to continue to hold a grudge against her much later in the text. Her disappearance in the second half of the epic may reflect the sources of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, but it also suggests a lack of interest in the character when she is no longer directly relevant to the story.

=== Nibelungenklage ===

The &quot;Nibelungenklage&quot; (c. 1200) is a sort of sequel to the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; that describes how the survivors of the end of the last poem deal with the catastrophe. After the dead are buried, Dietrich von Bern arranges for a messenger to travel to Worms to inform the Burgundians. The messenger is received by Brunhild, who admits her responsibility for Siegfried&#x27;s death and is shown to be greatly saddened by Gunther&#x27;s death. She calls together all the nobles of the realm to decide on a course of action. Following a period of mourning, Brunhild and Gunther&#x27;s son Siegfried is crowned as the new king of the Burgundians.

=== Rosengarten zu Worms ===

In the &quot;Rosengarten zu Worms&quot; version D (after 1250), Brunhild is mentioned as among the spectators watching the tournament in Kriemhild&#x27;s rose garden.

=== Þiðrekssaga ===

Although the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; (c. 1250) is written in Old Norse, the majority of the material is translated from German (particularly Low German) oral tales, as well as possibly some from German written sources such as the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Therefore, it is included here. The saga-author can nonetheless be shown to have changed some details to accord with Scandinavian traditions, of which he was aware.

According to the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot;, Brunhild is the daughter of king Heimir and lives in the castle of Saegard in Swabia. There she runs a stud farm that produces excellent horses. Sigurd encounters Brunhild shortly after he has killed the dragon Regin; he breaks into her castle and kills several of her warriors, but Brunhild recognizes Sigurd, tells him the names of his parents, and gives him the horse Grani before he leaves.

Later, Sigurd, who has gone to the court of the Burgundians (called Niflungs), advises Gunnar (Gunther) to marry Brunhild, and the two go to see her. She is angered that Sigurd has not kept his promise to marry only her—something which was not mentioned in their previous encounter—but Sigurd persuades her to marry Gunnar. She nevertheless refuses to consummate the marriage on the wedding night, and Sigurd must take Gunther&#x27;s place (and shape) to take her virginity for Gunnar, which robs her of her strength.

Some time later, while Sigurd is living with the Burgundians, Brunhild begins to quarrel with Sigurd&#x27;s wife Grimhild over which of them has the higher status. One day, Grimhild fails to rise when Brunhild enters the hall. This causes Brunhild to accuse Grimhild of being married to a man without noble birth, whereupon Grimhild produces a ring that Brunhild had given to Sigurd (thinking he was Gunnar) after he had deflowered her, and publicly proclaims that Sigurd and not Gunnar took Brunhild&#x27;s virginity. Brunhild then convinces Gunnar and Högni to kill Sigurd. Brunhild is shown to be overjoyed once it has occurred. Afterwards, she largely disappears from the saga, though it is mentioned that King Atli (Etzel) visits her among the Burgundians.

=== Biterolf und Dietleib ===

In &quot;Biterolf und Dietleib&quot; (c. 1250), a parody of sorts of the heroic world, Brunhild is shown to be concerned with avoiding loss of life in the war between the Burgundians and the heroes of the Dietrich von Bern cycle. She gives Rüdiger von Bechelaren, who acts as a messenger for the Dietrich heroes, a lance with a banner on it as a reward for his having done his job well. At a later point, Rüdiger and Brunhild negotiate the transformation of the battle into a tournament, though this quickly becomes an actual battle once more. When the Dietrich heroes succeed in reaching the gates of Worms, Brunhild and the other Burgundian women force a stop to hostilities. In the conciliatory festivities that follow, Brunhild explains that she gave Rüdiger the lance so that all the warriors would be encouraged to show the best of their abilities, not so that any would be killed.

Brunhild&#x27;s role in &quot;Biterolf&quot; is usually taken to parodic, and includes the detail that she says that she is afraid of Gunther&#x27;s strength, whereupon Rüdiger reminds her of her own violent past. That Brunhild has given Etzel&#x27;s most important hero, Rüdiger, a lance to fight against the Burgundians, without however, any of them dying, likely had a strong parodic effect on the poem&#x27;s audience. &quot;Biterolf&quot; also makes no mention of the hostility between Kriemhild and Brunhild.

== Theories about the development of the Brunhild figure ==

If the origin of Brunhild in Brunhilda of Austrasia and Fredegund is correct, then Brunhild&#x27;s role in Sigurd/Siegfried&#x27;s murder would be the oldest part of her legend and an original part of the Sigurd legend. Theodore Andersson has argued that Brunhild was originally the more important figure of the two, as she is the main character in the surviving Eddic poems. He argues that only later did Sigurd come to be regarded as the more significant figure, as he acquired more stories beyond his murder.

Brunhild is nevertheless first attested as a legendary figure in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; (c. 1200), with earlier attested placenames derived from the name &quot;Brunhild&quot; most likely referring to the historical queen.

=== Identity as a valkyrie and awakening ===

There is no consensus as to whether Brunhild&#x27;s identification as a valkyrie in the Norse legends represents an old common Germanic tradition or a late development, unique to the Scandinavian tradition. It is possible that the German Brunhild&#x27;s immense strength alludes to a mythological past in which she was a valkyrie.

On the other hand, &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; gives the valkyrie whom Sigurd awakens another name, and many of the details about the Norse Brunhild do not accord with her being a valkyrie. It is possible that the Norse Sigurd was originally involved with two separate women, a valkyrie and his sister-in-law, who have been &quot;imperfectly merged.&quot; Given the close similarity of Brunhild&#x27;s awakening in the Scandinavian tradition to the common fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty, some scholars dismiss it as without basis in the original tradition. The existence of a mountain called &quot;lectulus Brunihildae&quot; (Brunhild&#x27;s bed) in the Taunus may attest to the awakening story in Germany, but it is more likely that this name refers to the historical queen Brunhilda of Austrasia. The superhuman powers Brunhild displays in both traditions may simply be a narrative way to make her an equal to Sigurd.

=== Wooing ===

There is considerable debate about whether the ride through the wall of flames attested in the Norse tradition or the feats of strength attested in the continental tradition represents the older version of the wooing of Brunhild. Although the ride through the flames is only attested in Scandinavia, a somewhat similar scene occurs in &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot; when Siegfried rescues Kriemhild. The feats of strength that Brunhild&#x27;s suitors must complete in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, on the other hand, are paralleled in a Russian fairy tale that also contains a very similar scene in which the bride ties her new husband by his hands and feet on her wedding night. These parallels have led some scholars to argue that the feats of strength are not original to the tradition. Others have argued that the Russian fairy tale may derive from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

Common to all versions of the wooing is that Sigurd takes Gunther&#x27;s place in the marriage bed in one way or another using deception and strength, which later provides part of Brunhild&#x27;s motivation to have him killed.

=== Relationship to Atli (Attila) and family ===

In the Scandinavian tradition, Brunhild is the sister of Atli (Attila); scholars generally see this as recent development of the saga. The familial connection to Atli provides an additional motivation for Atli&#x27;s enmity for the Burgundians.

Brunhild&#x27;s sister in the Scandinavian tradition, Oddrun, also does not seem to be a figure of the traditional legend. The continental tradition makes no reference to Brunhild having any kin at all, whereas the Scandinavian material mentions both a father (Budli, father of Atli) and a fosterfather, Heimir. Theodore Andersson writes that &quot;the family [that appears in Norse tradition] looks like a late speculative attempt to domesticate [Brunhild] in the style of other heroic stories.&quot;

=== Relationship to Sigurd ===

Though it is only attested in the Norse tradition, it seems likely that the German Siegfried also had prior involvement with Brunhild before he wooed her for Gunther—the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; strongly hints that the two already know each other. Brunhild&#x27;s original motivation for having Sigurd killed seems to have been her public dishonor, the only motivation observable in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; and the &quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot;. Her motivation as a scorned lover, which is introduced in the &quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; and reaches its apex in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, is likely a later development of the Norse tradition and is possibly inspired by the story of Tristan and Iseult.

=== Suicide ===

Theodore M. Andersson and Hans Kuhn have both argued that Brunhild&#x27;s suicide is a later development in the tradition, possibly modeled after the presumed original death of Gudrun/Kriemhild in the burning of Atli/Etzel&#x27;s hall.

== Modern culture ==

Modern reception of Brunhild in Germany begins with the 1755 rediscovery of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;; early reception of the poem, however, largely focused on the figure of Kriemhild rather than Brunhild. In Scandinavia, the so-called &quot;Scandinavian Renaissance&quot; meant that traditions of Brunhild from the &quot;Edda&quot; remained somewhat more current and even influenced the Scandinavian ballad tradition to some degree, in which Brunhild also played a role.

Brunhild became a more important character in Germany with the introduction of the Norse material to a German audience. The Norse versions of the material were seen as more &quot;original&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot;, and were thus often preferred to the courtly &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. In Friedrich Hebbel&#x27;s three-part tragedy &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, Brunhild comes to symbolize a heathen past that must be overcome by Christianity, represented by Dietrich von Bern.

Richard Wagner&#x27;s four-part opera cycle &quot;Ring des Nibelungen&quot; makes Brunhild into a major character, closer in line to the Old Norse sources, but Wagner occasionally took elements from the continental &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; or invented them himself. Wagner refers to his Brunhild character as &quot;Brünnhilde&quot;, deriving the -e ending from the dative of the Middle High German female given name &quot;Hilt&quot; and likely respelling &quot;Brün-&quot; as &quot;Brünn-&quot; to make the connection to modern German &quot;Brünne&quot; (armor) more obvious. Wagner&#x27;s depiction of the character has largely eclipsed the original sources in the popular imagination, with most modern references to Brunhild deriving from Wagner in one way or another, particularly outside of Germany and Scandinavia. Brunhild also plays a major role in the first film of Fritz Lang&#x27;s duology &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;. Here, she is largely based on her role in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, but also features some elements taken from the Norse tradition, namely her relationship to Siegfried and her suicide.

The majority of modern treatments of the figure in comic books, video games, etc. do not engage directly with the medieval sources.

<text>CycL in computer science and artificial intelligence, is an ontology language used by Douglas Lenat&#x27;s Cyc artificial intelligence project. Ramanathan V. Guha was instrumental in designing early versions of the language. A close CycL variant exists named &quot;MELD&quot;.

The original version of CycL was a frame language, but the modern version is not. Rather, it is a declarative language based on classical first-order logic, with extensions for modal logic operators and higher-order logic quantification.

CycL is used to represent the knowledge stored in the Cyc Knowledge Base, available from Cycorp. The source code written in CycL released with the OpenCyc system is licensed as free and open-source software, to increase its usefulness in supporting the semantic web.

== Basic ideas ==
The basic ideas of CycL include:
* Naming the constants used to refer to information for represented concepts.
* Grouping the constants together in a generalization—specialization hierarchy, usually called categorization.
* Stating general rules that support inference about the concepts.
* The truth or falsity of a CycL sentence is context-relative; these contexts are represented in CycL as Microtheories.

=== Constants ===
The concept names in Cyc are known as &quot;constants&quot;. Constants start with &quot;#$&quot; and are case-sensitive. There are constants for:
* Individual items known as &quot;individuals&quot;, such as #$BillClinton or #$France. 
* &quot;Collections&quot;, such as #$Tree-ThePlant (containing all trees) or #$EquivalenceRelation (containing all equivalence relations). A member of a collection is called an &quot;instance&quot; of that collection.
* &quot;Truth Functions&quot; which can be applied to one or more other concepts and return either true or false. For example, #$siblings is the sibling relationship, true if the two arguments are siblings. By convention, truth function constants start with a lower-case letter. Truth functions may be broken down into logical connectives (such as #$and, #$or, #$not, #$implies), quantifiers (#$forAll, #$thereExists, etc.) and predicates.
* &quot;Functions&quot;, which produce new terms from given ones. For example, #$FruitFn, when provided with an argument describing a type (or collection) of plants, will return the collection of its fruits. By convention, function constants start with an upper-case letter and end with the string &quot;Fn&quot;.

=== Specialization and generalization ===
The most important predicates are #$isa and #$genls. The first one (#$isa) describes that one item is an instance of some collection (i.e., specialization), the second one (#$genls) that one collection is a subcollection of another one (i.e., generalization). Facts about concepts are asserted using certain CycL &quot;sentences&quot;. Predicates are written before their arguments, in parentheses:

For example:
: (#$isa #$BillClinton #$UnitedStatesPresident) \;
&quot;Bill Clinton belongs to the collection of U.S. presidents&quot; and
: (#$genls #$Tree-ThePlant #$Plant) \;
&quot;All trees are plants&quot;.
: (#$capitalCity #$France #$Paris) \;
&quot;Paris is the capital of France.&quot;

=== Rules ===

Sentences can also contain variables, strings starting with &quot;?&quot;. One important rule asserted about the #$isa predicate reads

 (#$implies
 (#$and
 (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUBSET)
 (#$genls ?SUBSET ?SUPERSET))
 (#$isa ?OBJ ?SUPERSET))

with the interpretation &quot;if OBJ is an instance of the collection SUBSET and SUBSET is a subcollection of SUPERSET, then OBJ is an instance of the collection SUPERSET&quot;.

Another more complicated example is one that expresses a rule about a group or category rather than any particular individual, is:

 (#$relationAllExists #$biologicalMother #$ChordataPhylum #$FemaleAnimal)

which means that for every instance of the collection #$ChordataPhylum (i.e., for every chordate), there exists a female animal (instance of #$FemaleAnimal) which is its mother (described by the predicate #$biologicalMother).

(Or in looser English, if a given animal has a backbone, then there will be a link from that animal expressing the concept of that animal&#x27;s &quot;biological Mother&quot;. The thing that &quot;fills in the blank&quot; for the biological Mother must also be able to be categorized as a Female Animal.)

=== Microtheories ===
The knowledge base is divided into &quot;microtheories&quot; (Mt), collections of concepts and facts typically pertaining to one particular realm of knowledge. Unlike the knowledge base as a whole, each microtheory is required to be free from contradictions. Each microtheory has a name which is a regular constant; microtheory constants contain the string &quot;Mt&quot; by convention. An example is #$MathMt, the microtheory containing mathematical knowledge. The microtheories can inherit from each other and are organized in a hierarchy:

one specialization of #$MathMt is #$GeometryGMt, the microtheory about geometry.

<text>Radio-controlled cars, or RC cars for short, are miniature vehicles (cars, vans, buses, buggies, etc.) controlled via radio. 

Nitro powered models use glow plug engines, small internal combustion engines fuelled by a special mixture of nitromethane, methanol, and oil (in most cases a blend of castor oil and synthetic oil). These are referred to as &quot;nitro&quot; RC cars. Nitro fuel can be dangerous. It causes complications like cancer if ingested and blindness if in the eyes. Exceptionally large models, typically of scale 1:5, are powered by small gasoline engines, similar to string trimmer motors, which use a mix of oil and gasoline. Electric cars are generally considered easier to work with compared to fuel-driven models but can be equally complex at the higher budget and skill levels. Both electric and nitro models can be very fast, although electric is easier to upgrade and more versatile. 

In both of these categories, both &quot;on-road&quot; and &quot;off-road vehicles&quot; are available. Off-road models, which are built with fully functional off-road suspensions and a wide tire selection, can be used on various types of terrain. On-road cars, with a much less robust suspension, are limited to smooth, paved surfaces. There are also rally cars, which fall somewhere between on-road and off-road and can be driven on gravel, dirt or other loose surfaces. In the past decade, advances in &quot;on-road&quot; vehicles have made their suspension as adjustable as many full scale race cars, today.

==History==
The Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA), recognized and documented early radio-controlled model aircraft as having been developed in the 1930s. However, radio-controlled model cars have only been documented more recently. There may have been earlier model car hobbyists, inspired by RC airplanes, tinkering with RC cars but not documented. Here are the RC car projects that have been documented.

===Early experiments===
- 1954 Design Competition RC Winner - A streamlined radio-controlled vehicle won a third prize in Ford Motor Company&#x27;s 1954 Industrial Arts Awards program. David Swinder of Warren, Ohio used a large control console to demonstrate the operation of the six-foot vehicle to Al Esper, Ford&#x27;s chief test driver.

- 1955 Ford Motor Company RC Model Car - Automobile manufacturer studios used scale models to reduce new design development lead times and save money. Among Ford designs executed in 3/8 size were the LaTosca, a futuristic bubble-top dream car, and the Mexico, an aerodynamic reskin of the 1955 Thunderbird that was designed to top 200 mph. For these two models the designers constructed radio control systems, adapting six-volt car batteries, convertible top motors, and other full-size components from the Ford parts bins. Along with motive power, braking, and turning, the radio control system also reportedly operated the headlights, brake lights, and turn signals.

- Early 1960&#x27;s Bill Johnson Experimental Car - In an article in the first issue (September 1970) of ‘Pit Stop’ magazine, Bill Johnson of Burbank, California is credited with building “in the early 1960’s”, an internal combustion engine-powered, radio-controlled, 1:12th scale, model car. The date is not specific, but it seems reasonable that “the early ‘60’s” would mean the car was built around 1963 or earlier.

It was described as an all metal, radio-controlled race car using an early Bonner reed radio control system. The car was composed of two sections, in the forward section the radio, power pack, two servos, and front suspension; the rear section contained the motor, rear end, rear suspension and the fuel tank.

A Veco .19 engine was chosen for its ability to deliver power at any given RPM. Bill experimented with a 4:1 direct drive gear ratio and finally settled on a 6:1 ratio. Using -inch diameter rear tires, Bill achieved a 600 to 2,500 RPM range resulting in speeds from 6 miles per hour to 29 miles per hour.

His independent front suspension, while not having adjustable camber, caster or other adjustments, and although on the heavy side by later standards, proved quite durable. The car tracked well in a straight line or in circles as small as 8 feet in diameter. Bill utilized a leaf spring front set-up to reduce jolts on rough surfaces. He had tried a worm drive to eliminate the jolts to the steering servo but that proved impractical.

For the rear suspension Johnson also used leaf springs because of the ease of installation in the car and to facilitate the changes that he anticipated as the car design evolved. Working alone, Bill achieved a remarkable degree of success and sophistication with a model car that was a very early functioning RC car, more remarkable because it was built from scratch, since no RC car parts were yet available.

- 1964 Ken Balz Experimental Car - Ken built an electric-powered, radio-controlled model car which combined a Monogram 1:8 scale Big “T” plastic model car kit with an Orbit 4-channel radio transmitter and receiver. Two “Micro Mo” motors with 485-to-1 gear reduction were used, one for steering and one to power the car. Rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries supplied the energy. Steering was proportional but required two channels, one for left turns and one for right turns. Drive was not proportional but was single speed, radio-controlled “forward-stop-reverse-stop” sequence switch.

- 1965 Chuck Eckles Experimental Cars - (Chuck was erroneously called Bill Eccles in one article) Chuck&#x27;s first experiment was a 1:8 scale plastic kit Monogram Jaguar E-Type, McCoy35 internal combustion, radio-controlled car with a stainless-steel chassis. His initial clutch was designed to engage and turn the engine to start it and then disengage so that the engine could idle. It would then re-engage centrifugally as the engine speed was increased. 

The car ran well, but the combination of a fragile plastic body, more power than needed and a complex clutch led Chuck to do a major redesign. He used a 1:11 scale Wen-Mac 1965 Mustang to make a plaster plug master for more durable vacuum-formed 0.060 butyl-acetate bodies. He developed a simplified centrifugal clutch more like current designs. Two servos were used, the forward servo being used for steering, while the rear servo for both brake and throttle. The Mustang&#x27;s rear axle ratio was 12:56 with a 56-tooth gear that was as large as space and ground clearance would permit. Wheels and tires used were semi-pneumatic, -inch Veco aircraft wheels.

After several experiments, the engine used was a Cox Medallion .15 with part of the throttle control used as a collector ring for exhaust and excess oil. The carburettor spray bar had been reworked to give a better idle, while an adjustable stop was installed. The top speed achieved was 35 miles per hour.

Steering was rack and pinion with an independent front suspension. The overall length of this pioneering vehicle was -inch, with a height of -inch, a width of -inch and an all-up weight of 3 ½ pounds.

===Early commercial RC car kits===

Toy and hobby companies had been selling various motorized model vehicles for many years but interest in commercial production of radio-controlled model car kits began with hobbyists -
- 1965 - In the July/August 1965 issue of American Modeler magazine, Walter McEntee, called the “World’s best-known writer of radio control news” published a picture of five people with transmitters racing five cars (in a slightly snowy lot) and the caption, “West Germany’s Schuco-Hegi outfit offers Porsche Carrera 904GT racing coupe kit for multi-channel operation. Car is 22.8” long on 12.6” wheel base, uses two Monoperm electric motors. Kit has ready-made plastic body, special front suspension parts and diecast wheels. These demonstration cars were said to have Metz Mecatron 10-channel superheterodyne radio receivers&quot;.

- 1967 – In the March 1967 issue of Car Model magazine, an article by an experienced RC airplane hobbyist, Tom Dion of Michigan, USA, outlined how to build an RC car and announced the availability of 1:18 scale RC car and radios in component kits.

===Early commercial ready-to-run RC Cars===
- 1955 Radicon Radio Control Bus - Masudaya is Japan’s oldest operating toy company, tracing its history back to 1724. The Masudaya Toys (MT) “Radicon Radio Control” series of toys from the middle 1950s included a bus which was said on the box to be “The First and Only Complete Radio Remote Control Toy”. From eBay company “Yuzuhina Shop” in Japan, I received this: “According to my research…it was the world’s first radio-controlled toy, launched in November 1955”.

- 1965 Astroguide Astro Car – In the July/August 1965 issue of American Modeler magazine, on pages 50 and 75, the Radio Control Equipment Report section included announcements from the 1965 Toledo (Ohio, USA) RC Conference about several radio controlled models made by the Astroguide Corporation of Addison, Illinois. Along with the Astro Cruiser boat and Astro Plane; the Astro Car was included. It used a plastic 1:25 scale AMT 1962 Ford body with proportional steering controlled by the single channel Astro Fli radio. Five different frequencies were available, range was listed as 150’ and scale speed at 180 mph.
The car, with three nickel-cad pencells and a charger was announced at $36. These items were listed in a later Montgomery Wards catalog as complete packages, the Astro Car with radio was $59.95. It is interesting to note that the range was still listed as 150’ but scale speed was up to 200 mph. 

- 1966 Wen-Mac/Testors Mustang - In the early 1950s, toy company Wen-Mac produced a cast aluminium, .049 gas engine powered Indy tether car, the Wen-Mac Automite. By the ‘60’s they were producing plastic, gas-powered tether cars. Then, in the November 19, 1965 issue of Life magazine, Ford Motor Company advertised an exclusive – “Only at Your Ford Dealers” - 16-inch, 1966 Poppy Red Motorized Mustang GT made by Wen-Mac. The price was $4.95. The ad showed a young boy playing with it indoors to show that it had a battery-powered electric motor. However, the ad also noted, “For racing buffs a conversion kit (gasoline engine and slicks) and remote-control throttle may also be ordered.” The conversion kit also included a pylon and spikes for attaching the pylon to an outdoor racing surface and a line to tether the car. The revolutionary advancement was the “remote control throttle” (not radio control). This consisted of a second line fed from the car, through the pylon and back to the “driver” to control the throttle of the .049 cubic inch, two-stroke gas engine. Remote control by radio was the next step.

Apparently that next step was being developed during late 1965 and early 1966. Wen-Mac was purchased by Testors in 1966 and, in the April 1966 issue of Car Model magazine, coverage of the February 1966 Hobby Industry Trade show in Chicago included the Testors model company announcement of a radio-controlled, electric powered version of what was apparently the same basic 16” 1966 Mustang GT. It was mistakenly called a 1:9 scale model when actually, a 16&quot; long 1966 Mustang is 1:11 scale.

It was powered by electric motors and had rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries. To operate the car, a switch on the bottom of the chassis was first set to select Low Speed or High Speed. The transmitter had 3 channels, one connected to a push button that transmitted a simple “Go or Stop” signal to the drive motors. The other two channels were very early proportional controls, activated by a single stick; pushing it right activated the right turn channel and left for the left steering channel. The innovative drive system had two transverse motors, one for the right rear wheel and one for the left. Both motors powered the car when operated in a straight line but in a turn, the inside free-wheeled, creating a form of rear differential. Three different 27MHz channels were available to allow running 3 cars at a time. The price announced in 1966 for the complete, ready to run car was $69.95, a clear indication of the high price of radio control in what was originally a $4.95 battery electric car without radio control.
- 1966 ElGi Ferrari 250LM - Another commercially viable RC car was available by mid-1966, produced by the Italian company El-Gi (Elettronica Giocattoli) from Reggio Emilia. Their first model, an electric 1:12 Ferrari 250 LM had a radio-controlled on-off motor function with no reverse. Steering had two on-off switches, turn radius was determined by how long the operator held down the appropriate left or right switch on the transmitter. An extensive article about the car and its driving characteristics appeared in the June 1966 Italian magazine Quattroruote.

Concerning viable 1:8 scale race cars, information received by David Palmeter in a November, 2018 email from Mardave founder Wes Raynor stated: &quot;When I started Mardave R/C Racing (in Leicester, England) in 1969/70 (not too sure which!) we claimed to be the first r/c (racing) car manufacturers in Europe. These cars were 1/8 scale, (proportional radio) I.C. engine powered cars.&quot;

In the early 1970s, several commercial products were created by small firms in the US. Most of these companies began as slot car companies and with the wane in popularity of that genre moved into the R/C field. Among these were Associated Electrics, Thorp, Dynamic, Taurus, Delta, and Scorpion. These primarily were 1/8 scale nitro-powered (then called gas) aluminium flat pan cars generally powered by a .21 cubic inch engine. The bodies for these cars were vacuum formed polycarbonate (the most popular made of Lexan). The most popular engine was the K&amp;B Veco McCoy. The primary sanctioning body for races for these cars was Remotely Operated Auto Racers (ROAR). In 1973–74, Jerobee, a company based in Washington State, created their 1/12 nitro car using a Cox .049 engine. Over 54,000 were sold &quot;Ready to Run&quot; W/Radio control system of which 25K were made by EK Product od Texas and the balance by JoMac when they bought the company from Rocket Research Corp. Several aftermarket companies created parts for this car including clear Lexan bodies, heat sinks, and larger fuel tanks. This scale evolved into 1/12 scale electric racing when Associated Electrics created the RC12E in 1976–77. Jerobee became Jomac and created their own electric kit called the Lightning 2000 that won the &quot;ROAR&quot; National Championships in 1981&amp; 82 for 6-Cell Modified and 82 the 6-Cell Production classes. The Lightning 2000 was designed by Don McKay and Jon Congdon.

By the late 1970s, interests in 1/12 scale electric racing began to grow as 1/8 scale IC racers, the sole racing category at the time, needing to race throughout the winter as an alternative to their impractical IC cars began to race 1/12 cars, therefore a winter national series was developed. As a result, the series grew into popularity as a large number of scratch-built cars started to appear in these meetings. Again, electric r/c cars were enabled by one revolutionary development, that of the NiCad rechargeable battery. Prior to the mid-1970s, batteries were either heavy lead acid or expensive throw away dry cells. In 1976, the Japanese firm Tamiya, which was renowned for their intricately detailed plastic model kits, released a series of elegant and highly detailed, but mechanically simple electric on-road car models that were sold as &quot;suitable for radio control&quot;. Although rather expensive to purchase, the kits and radio systems sold rapidly. Tamiya soon began to produce more purpose-built remote-controlled model cars, and were the first to release off-road buggies featuring real suspension systems. It was this progression toward the off-road class that brought about much of the hobby&#x27;s popularity, as it meant radio-controlled cars were no longer restricted to bitumen and smooth surfaces, but could be driven virtually anywhere. The first true Tamiya off-road vehicles were the Sand Scorcher and the Rough Rider, both released in 1979, and both based on realistic dune buggy designs. Tamiya continued to produce off-road vehicles in increasing numbers, featuring working suspensions, more powerful motors, textured off-road rubber tires and various stylized &quot;dune buggy&quot; bodies. They also produced trucks, such as the Toyota HiLux Pickup, that featured realistic three-speed gearboxes and leaf-spring suspension systems. All of these models were realistic, durable, easy to assemble, capable of being modified, and simple to repair. They were so popular that they could be credited with launching a boom in radio-controlled model cars in the early to mid 1980s, and provided the basis for today&#x27;s radio-controlled car market. Popular Tamiya models included the Grasshopper and the Hornet dune buggies as well as the Blackfoot and Clodbuster monster truck models. The earliest Tamiya models, particularly the early off roaders, are now highly sought after by vintage R/C collectors and can fetch prices of up to US$3000 on internet auction sites if still in mint, unbuilt form. Acknowledging their continued popularity, several of the early kits have even been re-released by Tamiya during 2005–2007, with a few alterations.

A British firm, Schumacher Racing, was the first to develop an adjustable ball differential in 1980, which allowed nearly infinite tuning for various track conditions. At the time the majority of on-road cars had a solid axle, while off-road cars generally had a gear-type differential. Team Associated followed suit with the introduction of the RC100 1/8 scale gas on-road car, RC12 1/12 scale on-road electric car, and RC10 1/10 scale off-road electric racing buggy in 1984 (see below). Team Losi followed with the introduction of the JRX2 in 1988.

==Toy-grade RC cars==
Toy-grade RC cars are typically manufactured with a focus on design coupled with reducing production costs. Whereas a hobby-grade car has separate electronic components that are individually replaceable if they fail, toy-grade cars are typically made with cheaper components that are harder to find as spare parts, and a single electronic circuit board is integrated into the design of the vehicle.

Although hobby-grade enthusiasts may look down on toy-grade RC cars, their maintenance is much easier than that of hobby-grade models since the number of components is drastically smaller, and parts can be harvested at almost no cost from any RC toy car of a similar size. Performance is generally much less than hobby-grade cars but can be upgraded by adding hobby-grade parts. Stock toy-grade cars are equipped with weaker motors and are powered by alkaline or NiCad batteries, which means their top speed is usually only . Cheaper ones lack any form of a suspension and the ones that do feature a suspension that has very primitive or rudimentary designs. Steering typically lacks proportional control (with only three positions: straight, full left, and full right) and there is typically no proportional &quot;throttle&quot; either, with stopped and full power usually being the only options.

Most toy-grade cars are primarily marketed toward children, although some older enthusiasts enjoy tinkering with them and improving them. Many toy-grade cars also have highly detailed scale body shells, which are often adapted for use on hobby-grade vehicles to give them a more scale appearance. However, you can get hold of larger more powerful real-looking RC cars but they are not exactly &quot;toy-grade&quot;.

Many hobby-grade enthusiasts began their fascination with radio-controlled models starting with Toy-Grade models during the &#x27;Golden Age of Toy RC&#x27; from the late 1980s—early 1990s when the companies Taiyo Kogyo Co. Ltd (Japan) and Tyco Toys (USA) dominated the market and became household names, with their products starring in TV shows, Hollywood movies, and featured under Christmas trees worldwide just as often as the leading Sega and Nintendo game consoles of that era. It was during this time that some of the most popular radio-controlled toys ever made were manufactured, beginning with the 1986 Taiyo Jet Hopper (Japan, Europe, Australia), later sold as the Tyco 9.6V Turbo Hopper (in the United States), followed by the Typhoon Hovercraft, the Fast Traxx, the Scorcher 6x6, the Bandit, and the Eliminator to name just a few. The designs for many of these toys can be traced back to only a few inventors, namely Shohei Suto (owner of now defunct Taiyo Kogyo Co. Ltd.) who was responsible for many of the early Taiyo cars such as the Jet Hopper, and who contributed together with Neil Tilbor, and Michael G. Hetman (inventors at Tyco) to the Bandit, Eliminator, Fast Traxx, Typhoon, Mutator 4WD, Scorcher, and Python.

==Hobby-grade radio control models==

In past several years, hobby-grade &quot;ready-to-run&quot; (or &quot;RTR&quot;) models have become readily available from major manufacturers of radio-controlled cars, attracting many hobbyists who would otherwise not have purchased a kit car. Vehicles of this type need little or no final assembly and in most cases, the bodies are shipped painted and trimmed. Safety inspection of the product to ensure correct operation is essential, as injury to operators or bystanders from disassembling vehicles is possible. A number of cars and trucks are presently available only in ready-to-run form. The growing popularity of the RTR vehicle has prompted many manufacturers to discontinue production of kit vehicles. High-spec racing vehicles are generally still available or sold only as kits, and companies like Thunder Tiger, Losi, HPI, Traxxas and Tamiya sell kit and RTR versions with the benefits of a kit version being in upgraded parts or lower costs, respectively. Hobby grade vehicles can cost much more, ranging from US$90 to over US$2000.

===Ready-to-run===
As the name suggests, are pre-assembled models ready for immediate use. They can reach varying speeds, with lower end models reaching about and higher end or modified models capable of reaching upwards of . There are versions that run on both batteries and nitro.

===Kits===

Kit vehicles are sold as a box of individual parts, and must be assembled before driving. Although they require more skill to get running than an RTR vehicle, a relatively easy kit (such as those from Tamiya) is a good way to learn more about working on RC cars. Many kits are very easily modified with a wide variety of available parts. There are also &quot;ARTR&quot; or Almost Ready To Run models, which come mostly assembled but require a small amount of extra work before running. Most ARTR&#x27;s only require electronics that are distributed by other brands.

===Electric models===

Electrically powered models utilize mechanical speed controllers (MSC&#x27;s) or electronic speed controllers (ESC&#x27;s) to adjust the amount of power delivered to the electric motor. The power delivered is proportional to the amount of throttle called for by the transmitter—the more the trigger is pulled, the faster it goes. The voltage is &quot;pulsed&quot; using pulse-width modulation to produce varying output with smooth transitions and greater efficiency. Electronic speed controllers use solid state components that regulate the duty cycle, adjusting the power delivered to the electrical motor. In addition, most electronic speed controllers can use the electric motor as a magnetic brake, offering better control of the model than is possible with a mechanical speed control.

Mechanical speed controllers use a network of resistors and switch between them by rotating a head with an electrode around a plate that has electrical contacts. Mechanical speed controllers are prone to being slow to react because they are actuated by servos, waste energy in the form of heat from the resistors, commonly become dirty and perform intermittently, and lack a dedicated braking ability. They appear only in vintage RC models, and are now essentially obsolete.

Most electric cars up to recently used brushed motors but now many people are turning to brushless motors for their higher power output and because they require much less maintenance. They are rated either in relative turns or Kv. The Kv number tells how many RPM the motor will turn per volt. However, the ability of the system to put out power is dependent on the quality of the batteries used, wires and connectors supplying power. Due to their power, brushless motors are also used in bigger monster trucks and 1/8 nitro-powered buggies that have been converted to electric. High quality brushless systems can be much more powerful than nitro and can accomplish feats such as standing backflips when installed in a monster truck, most notably the HPI Savage Flux. Some 1/5 scale gas to electric conversions are in production but are uncommon due to high price.

A new form of electric RC racing was introduced in an August 3, 2008 YouTube video by Wes Raynor of England, he called the new hobby &#x27;MAGracing&#x27;. Cars are primarily 1/32 scale with some 1/24 scale. They are powered by rechargeable batteries, speed is controlled by RC. A magnet linked to the steering follows one of multiple steel wires buried just below the track surface enabling more accurate steering than is attainable with free running RC cars. An RC steering override allows cars to change lanes at specific places for following the &#x27;racing line&#x27; and to pass a slower car. Tracks can therefore be much narrower and smaller making the system suitable for &#x27;in home&#x27; racing. Cars can be driven back onto the track after
an &#x27;off&#x27;, using reverse if necessary, so that track marshals are not required.
===Nitro powered models===

Nitromethane nitro powered models utilize a single servo for throttle and braking control; rotation of the servo in one direction will cause the throttle on the carburettor to open, providing more air and fuel mixture to the internal combustion engine. Rotation of the servo in the other direction causes torque to be applied to a linkage and cam which causes friction with the braking material. The brake is commonly located on the driveshaft or spur gear in some cases and applies stopping power only to the driven wheels. Some models will also use an additional servo to control a transmission box, enabling the vehicle to drive in reverse.

Fuel engine sizes most often range between . This is due to restrictions by the main sanctioning bodies for radio-controlled racing. Many &quot;outlaw&quot; engines are manufactured larger than these, mainly intended for vehicles which will not be used in sanctioned races and therefore do not need to comply with these regulations. Engine size is related to the class of car; 1/10 scale on and off-road vehicles usually are equipped with .12–.18 cubic inch engines, with 1/8 scale vehicles using .21–.32 cubic inch engines. There are exceptions, with many Schumacher and Thunder Tiger/Team Associated RC models being good examples of unusually large engines coming as standard equipment on certain models.
Fuel-powered engines allow model cars to reach moderate speeds unmodified. Maximum power is generally achieved at medium to high speeds, and a slightly slower throttle response than electrically powered vehicles is to be expected due to clutching and lack of torque. Electric motors effectively produce instantaneous torque, whereas nitro engines, like full-sized gasoline engines, take time for the engine to spool up and for the clutch to engage. Nitro- (and fuel) powered cars may be refuelled and returned to action in a few seconds, as opposed to electrics which require removal of the body shell and battery fasteners to replace a discharged battery. Nitro cars are cooled some by air, some by the oil mixed in with the fuel and may be run continuously with no need to take breaks for cooling down assuming they are properly tuned.

Nitro-powered cars operate like full-sized fuel vehicles more than their electric counterparts do, making use of a two stroke engine rather than an electric motor. The sound of the engine noise is a main selling points to nitro enthusiasts, even though brushless electric equivalents are generally faster and do not require special fuel. However, their exhaust contains unburned oil, which usually ends up coating the chassis. This, in turn, requires more cleaning than an electric-powered equivalent. Cleaning is usually achieved by the use of compressed air nozzles and solvents (such as denatured alcohol). Tuning a fuel-powered vehicle requires learning to maintain optimum performance and fuel economy, and to minimize engine wear and overheating, even in ready-to-run vehicles. Running a nitro-fuel motor without tuning or tuning improperly can hurt performance in rich conditions, and cause severe damage in lean conditions.

Because of their ability to be driven for longer periods of time and the use of burning fuel, mechanical wear in nitro vehicles is generally greater than in electric vehicles. In addition, the increased weight of fuel-powered vehicles generally lead to higher speed collisions, causing greater damage to the collided vehicles, and a greater degree of safety concerns needs to be taken into account. Maintenance such as cleaning of the air filter and general chassis cleaning, replacement of worn clutch parts, proper after-run lubrication (necessary for storage) and maintenance of other motor-related items such as glow plug replacement makes for a more frustrating experience for first time RC users. In addition, nitro motors typically require rebuilding or replacement after 2–8 gallons (7–30 litres) of fuel run through them, due to loss of compression, which can be accelerated by poor tuning and overheating. It is also possible to seriously damage the engines by over-revving them with no load or ingestion of dirt into the carburettor. As such, nitro-powered vehicles are by nature expensive to maintain.

===Gasoline-powered models===
Gasoline-powered vehicles, also known as &quot;fuelies&quot; or &quot;gassers&quot;, run on a mix of gasoline and oil. They cost much more (usually US$800–US$3000 RTR) than nitro and electric cars. They are also much bigger, usually scale 1/6 or 1/5 usually referred to as Large Scale, and therefore require much more space to run. They do not usually have as high top-end speeds (compared to nitro and some electrics) but have much power and do not require much fuel to run. Over time the cost of a gas-powered car can be less than some nitro-powered vehicles, because of the high cost of nitro fuel and buying new nitro engines to replace worn-out ones. In addition, gas-powered motors rarely if ever require tuning and have a very long lifespan. These gas-powered vehicles really pertain to the individual who is more interested in scale than imagination. These large-scale models have been popular in Europe for over a decade with brands like FG Modelsport, MCD, Elcon, N-R-P and have become popular in the US thanks to companies like HPI Racing and Losi producing affordable high-quality models locally. In Europe there are sanctioned EFRA races that compete both in on-road cars as well as off-road cars to determine National Champions as well as European Champions, in the US ROAR has yet not picked up these as official classes.

===Accessories and upgrades===
Most RC models generally require the purchase of additional accessories. For electrical vehicles, battery packs and a suitable charger are needed to power the car and are seldom included. A soldering iron and supplies are often necessary to build high-performance battery packs or install upgraded electronics with low-resistance connectors. A Li-Polymer battery with a hard case is popular for RC cars, with the most common voltages being 7.4 V, which represents a 2S battery or 11.1 V, known as a 3S battery.

LiPo batteries are known to be explosive if mistreated, so some enthusiasts still use NiMH batteries instead, which are less powerful but safer. For nitro-powered vehicles, a glow plug heater and fuel are needed to start the engine, as well as 4 AA size batteries, or a rechargeable six-volt, five-cell battery pack to power the on-board electronics.

Nitro vehicles also require a means of cranking the engine over, which can be achieved using a pull-start, starter box, battery operated rotostart, or by an electric drill. The Traxxas nitro rc cars come with a hand start up system, that revs the engine and starts it up. It doesn&#x27;t require a pull start system. Relatively expensive model fuel, spare glow-plugs, and after-run oil are also needed. Gasoline-powered vehicles require only a receiver battery pack and a means to start the engine, usually the included pull-start. Hobby-grade vehicles almost always require 8 AA size batteries to power the transmitter, though some can use rechargeable transmitter pack or simply rechargeable AAs.

A large industry of aftermarket manufacturers produce upgrade or hop-up parts for hobby-grade cars. Upgrades range from mere improvements to the longevity of R/C car parts, to all-out performance enhancements. Some hobbyists create their own upgrades for sale via classifieds and online forums. Hobbyists choose to upgrade hobby-grade cars from plastic stock parts to aluminium parts to increase strength and the steering angle of the car.

==Principle of operation==
Radio-controlled cars use a common set of components for their control and operation. All cars require a transmitter, which has the joysticks for control, or in pistol grip form, a trigger for throttle and a wheel for turning, and a receiver which sits inside the car. The receiver changes the radio signal broadcast from the transmitter into suitable electrical control signals for the other components of the control system. Most radio systems utilize amplitude modulation for the radio signal and encode the control positions with pulse-width modulation. Upgraded radio systems are available that use the more robust frequency modulation and pulse-code modulation. Recently however, 2.4 GHz frequency radios have become the standard for hobby-grade R/C cars. The radio is wired up to either electronic speed controls or servomechanisms (shortened to &quot;servo&quot; in common usage) which perform actions such as throttle control, braking, steering, and on some cars, engaging either forward or reverse gears. Electronic speed controls and servos are commanded by the receiver through pulse-width modulation; pulse duration sets either the amount of current that an electronic speed control allows to flow into the electric motor or sets the angle of the servo. On these models the servo is attached to at least the steering mechanism; rotation of the servo is mechanically changed into a force which steers the wheels on the model, generally through adjustable turnbuckle linkages. Servo savers are integrated into all steering linkages and some nitro throttle linkages. A servo saver is a flexible link between the servo and its linkage that protects the servo&#x27;s internal gears from damage during impacts or stress.

==Modern developments in radio-controlled racing==
In 1984, Associated Electrics, Inc. of Costa Mesa, California introduced the &quot;RC10&quot; off-road electric racer; this model was a departure from &#x27;Associated Electrics&#x27; regular line of nitromethane-powered on-road race cars. Designed as a high-grade radio-controlled car, the chassis of the RC10 buggy was manufactured from anodized, aircraft-grade aluminium alloy. The shock absorbers were machined, oil-filled and completely tuneable; they were also produced from the same aluminium alloy. Suspension control arms were manufactured from high-impact nylon, as were the three-piece wheels.

Optional metal shielded ball bearings were sometimes incorporated in RC10 wheels and transmissions. The RC10 transmission contained an innovative differential featuring hardened steel rings pressed against balls—which made it almost infinitely adjustable for any track condition. The RC10 quickly became the dominant model in electric off-road racing.

In 1986, Schumacher Racing Products released their CAT (Competition All Terrain) vehicle, widely considered the best four wheel drive off-road &quot;buggy&quot; racer of the time. The CAT went on to win the 1987 off-road world championship. This car is credited for sparking an interest in four-wheel-drive electric off-road racing.

Gil Losi Jr., whose family ran the &quot;Ranch Pit Shop R/C&quot; racetrack in Pomona, California, turned his college studies toward engineering, primarily in the field of injection molded plastics, leading to his foundation of Team Losi. When the &quot;JRX-2&quot;, the first Team Losi buggy, was released, it initiated a rivalry with Team Associated that continues to this day. Team Losi went on to secure a number of achievements, which included the industry&#x27;s first all-natural rubber tires, the first American-made four-wheel-drive racing buggy, and an entirely new class of cars, the 1/18-scale Mini-T off-road electrics.

Although Losi and Associated seemed to dominate much of the American market, Traxxas, (another American company, famous for the X-Maxx and the Slash), and Kyosho (from Japan), were also making competitive two-wheel-drive off-road racing models. Although Losi and Associated were close rivals in the US, Schumacher off-road models continued to be popular amongst European hobbyists.

Electric and nitro cars have come a long way in terms of power. Electric cars have gone from non-rebuildable brushed motors and NiCad batteries to brushless motors and LiPo. Nitro cars have gone from small engines to huge .36-.80 engines that are used in big monster trucks.

The control systems for robotic cars have greatly evolved with the advances in internet communication systems. Attempts have been made to provide web protocol based control over robots.

===Telemetry in RC racing===
In the last few years, one-way telemetry systems have also been applied in RC racing cars to get information from the car&#x27;s sensors like
* Engine/motor RPM
* Battery voltage 
* Engine/motor temperature

The telemetry system is usually integrated in car&#x27;s receiver and transmitted to the controller.

<doc id="87141" wikidata="Q253405" url="?curid=87141" title="Connectedness">
<text>In mathematics, connectedness is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, &quot;all one piece&quot;. When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is connected; otherwise it is disconnected. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a &quot;component&quot; (or &quot;connected component&quot;).

==Connectedness in topology==
A topological space is said to be &quot;connected&quot; if it is not the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. A set is open if it contains no point lying on its boundary; thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.

==Other notions of connectedness==
Fields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects. Often such an object is said to be &quot;connected&quot; if, when it is considered as a topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, manifolds, Lie groups, and graphs are all called &quot;connected&quot; if they are connected as topological spaces, and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph is said to be &quot;connected&quot; if each pair of vertices in the graph is joined by a path. This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of graph theory. Graph theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the clustering coefficient.

Other fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of &quot;connectedness&quot; often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in category theory, a category is said to be &quot;connected&quot; if each pair of objects in it is joined by a sequence of morphisms. Thus, a category is connected if it is, intuitively, all one piece.

There may be different notions of &quot;connectedness&quot; that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological space &quot;connected&quot; if each pair of points in it is joined by a path. However this condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be &quot;path connected&quot;. While not all connected spaces are path connected, all path connected spaces are connected.

Terms involving &quot;connected&quot; are also used for properties that are related to, but clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected topological space is &quot;simply connected&quot; if each loop (path from a point to itself) in it is contractible; that is, intuitively, if there is essentially only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a sphere and a disk are each simply connected, while a torus is not. As another example, a directed graph is &quot;strongly connected&quot; if each ordered pair of vertices is joined by a directed path (that is, one that &quot;follows the arrows&quot;).

Other concepts express the way in which an object is &quot;not&quot; connected. For example, a topological space is &quot;totally disconnected&quot; if each of its components is a single point.

==Connectivity==

Properties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the word &quot;connectivity&quot;. For example, in graph theory, a connected graph is one from which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph. In recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be &quot;1-connected&quot;. Similarly, a graph is &quot;2-connected&quot; if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create a disconnected graph. A &quot;3-connected&quot; graph requires the removal of at least three vertices, and so on. The &quot;connectivity&quot; of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity of a graph is the greatest integer &quot;k&quot; for which the graph is &quot;k&quot;-connected.

While terminology varies, noun forms of connectedness-related properties often include the term &quot;connectivity&quot;. Thus, when discussing simply connected topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of &quot;simple connectivity&quot; than &quot;simple connectedness&quot;. On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined notion of &quot;connectivity&quot;, the word may be used as a synonym for &quot;connectedness&quot;.

Another example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single tile:

<text>Dieterich Buxtehude (; born Diderich Hansen Buxtehude, ; – 9 May 1707) was a Danish composer and organist of the Baroque period, whose works are typical of the North German organ school. As a composer who worked in various vocal and instrumental idioms, Buxtehude&#x27;s style greatly influenced other composers, such as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. Buxtehude is considered one of the most important composers of the 17th century.

==Life==
===Early years in Denmark===
He is thought to have been born with the name Diderich Buxtehude. His parents were Johannes (Hans Jensen) Buxtehude and Helle Jespersdatter. His father originated from Oldesloe in the Duchy of Holstein, which at that time was a part of the Danish realms in Northern Germany.
Scholars dispute both the year and country of Dieterich&#x27;s birth, although most now accept that he was born in 1637 in Helsingborg in the province of Scania/Skåne, which was part of Denmark at the time (but it is now part of Sweden). His obituary stated that &quot;he recognized Denmark as his native country, whence he came to our region; he lived about 70 years&quot;. Others, however, claim that he was born at Oldesloe. Later in his life he Germanized his name and began signing documents Dieterich Buxtehude.

His father – Johannes Buxtehude – was the organist at St. Olaf&#x27;s church in Helsingør and of St.Mary&#x27;s Church in Helsingborg. Dieterich was also employed as an organist, first in Helsingborg (from 1657 until 1658 or 1660) and then at Helsingør (1660–1668). The beginning of his career coincided with the First and Second Dano-Swedish Wars that led to the Swedish conquest of eastern Denmark (Scania, Blekinge and Halland). Consequently, the Buxtehudes found themselves living in Sweden. 

It is uncertain whether the war influenced Dieterich&#x27;s work situation, but in 1660, he accepted a position at St. Mary&#x27;s in Helsingør in Zealand. This is the only church where Buxtehude was employed that still has the organ in its original location. His father&#x27;s church organ from St Mary&#x27;s Church in Helsingborg that Dieterich also used is now located at Torrlösa Church, and it is also still in use and goes under the name of the &quot;Buxtehude church organ&quot;.

===Lübeck: Marienkirche===
Buxtehude&#x27;s last post, from 1668, was at the Marienkirche, Lübeck which had two organs, a large one for big services and a small one for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded Franz Tunder and followed in many of the footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder&#x27;s daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 – it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf&#x27;s Church, his father joined the family in Lübeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich&#x27;s brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.

His post in the free Imperial city of Lübeck afforded him considerable latitude in his musical career, and his autonomy was a model for the careers of later Baroque masters such as George Frideric Handel, Johann Mattheson, Georg Philipp Telemann and Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1673 he reorganized a series of evening musical performances, initiated by Tunder, known as &quot;Abendmusik,&quot; which attracted musicians from diverse places and remained a feature of the church until 1810. In 1703, Handel and Mattheson both traveled to meet Buxtehude, who was by then elderly and ready to retire. He offered his position in Lübeck to Handel and Mattheson but stipulated that the organist who ascended to it must marry his eldest daughter, Anna Margareta. Both Handel and Mattheson turned the offer down and left the day after their arrival. In 1705, J.S. Bach, then a young man of twenty, walked from Arnstadt to Lübeck, a distance of more than , and stayed nearly three months to hear the &quot;Abendmusik,&quot; meet the pre-eminent Lübeck organist, hear him play, and, as Bach explained, &quot;to comprehend one thing and another about his art&quot;. In addition to his musical duties, Buxtehude, like his predecessor Tunder, served as church treasurer.

===Influence and legacy===
Although more than 100 vocal compositions by Buxtehude survive, very few of them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its progressive elements.

==Works==
===General introduction===
The bulk of Buxtehude&#x27;s oeuvre consists of vocal music, which covers a wide variety of styles, and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Many of Buxtehude&#x27;s compositions have been lost. The librettos for his oratorios, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, although his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Philipp Telemann. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries can be found in the catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in Lübeck.

Gustaf Düben&#x27;s collection and the so-called Lübeck tablature A373 are the two most important sources for Buxtehude&#x27;s vocal music. The former includes several autographs, both in German organ tablature and in score. Both collections were probably created during Buxtehude&#x27;s lifetime and with his permission. Copies made by various composers are the only extant sources for the organ works: chorale settings are mostly transmitted in copies by Johann Gottfried Walther, while Gottfried Lindemann&#x27;s and others&#x27; copies concentrate on free works. Johann Christoph Bach&#x27;s manuscript is particularly important, as it includes the three known ostinato works and the famous Prelude and Chaconne in C major, BuxWV 137. Although Buxtehude himself most probably wrote in organ tablature, the majority of the copies are in standard staff notation.

===Keyboard works===

====Preludes and toccatas====
The nineteen organ &quot;praeludia&quot; (or &quot;preludes&quot;) form the core of Buxtehude&#x27;s work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either fugues or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by Nicolaus Bruhns, represent the highest point in the evolution of the north German organ prelude, and the so-called &quot;stylus phantasticus&quot;. They were undoubtedly among the influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently employ similar techniques.

The preludes are quite varied in style and structure, and are therefore hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike. The texture of Buxtehude&#x27;s praeludia can be described as either free or fugal. They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants. Structure-wise, there is usually an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude&#x27;s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way. A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with a five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).

The introductory sections are always improvisatory. The preludes begin almost invariably with a single motif in one of the voices which is then treated imitatively for a bar or two. After this the introduction will most commonly elaborate on this motif or a part of it, or on a short melodic germ which is passed from voice to voice in three- or four-voice polyphonic writing, as seen in Example 1:

Occasionally the introduction will engage in parallel 3rds, 6ths, etc. For example, BuxWV 149 begins with a single voice, proceeds to parallel counterpoint for nine bars and then segues into the kind of texture described above. The improvisatory interludes, free sections and postludes may all employ a vast array of techniques, from miscellaneous kinds of imitative writing (the technique discussed above, or &quot;fugues&quot; that dissolve into homophonic writing, etc.) to various forms of non-motivic interaction between voices (arpeggios, chordal style, figuration over pedal point, etc.). Tempo marks are frequently present: &quot;Adagio&quot; sections written out in chords of whole- and half-notes, &quot;Vivace&quot; and &quot;Allegro&quot; imitative sections, and others.

The number of fugues in a prelude varies from one to three, not counting the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently with some degree of repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. The answers are usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly during the course of the fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude&#x27;s fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in Froberger&#x27;s and Frescobaldi&#x27;s ricercars and canzonas (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.):

The fugal procedure dissolves at the end of the fugue when it is followed by a free section, as seen in Example 4:

Buxtehude&#x27;s other pieces that employ free writing or sectional structure include works titled &quot;toccata&quot;, &quot;praeambulum&quot;, etc. All are similar to the &quot;praeludia&quot; in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that he had his own way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.

====Chorale settings====
There are over 40 surviving chorale settings by Buxtehude, and they constitute the most important contributions to the genre in the 17th century. His settings include chorale variations, chorale ricercares, chorale fantasias and chorale preludes. Buxtehude&#x27;s principal contributions to the organ chorale are his 30 short chorale preludes. The chorale preludes are usually four-part cantus firmus settings of one stanza of the chorale; the melody is presented in an elaborately ornamented version in the upper voice, the three lower parts engage in some form of counterpoint (not necessarily imitative). Most of Buxtehude&#x27;s chorale settings are in this form. Here is an example from chorale &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; BuxWV 184:

The ornamented cantus firmus in these pieces represents a significant difference between the north German and the south German schools; Johann Pachelbel and his pupils would almost always leave the chorale melody unornamented.

The chorale fantasias (a modern term) are large-scale virtuosic sectional compositions that cover a whole strophe of the text and are somewhat similar to chorale concertos in their treatment of the text: each verse is developed separately, allowing for technically and emotionally contrasting sections within one composition. The presence of contrasting textures makes these pieces reminiscent of Buxtehude&#x27;s &quot;praeludia&quot;. Buxtehude was careful with correct word setting, paying particular attention to emphasis and interpretation. Each section is also closely related to the text of the corresponding lines (chromatic sections to express sadness, gigue fugues to express joy, etc.). Examples include fantasias on the [hymn]s &quot;Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ&quot; BuxWV 188, &quot;&quot; BuxWV 210, &quot;Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren&quot; BuxWV 213 and &quot;Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern&quot;, BuxWV 223.

Buxtehude&#x27;s chorale variations are usually in two or three voices. They consist of around 3–4 variations of which only one may use the pedal. These pieces are not as important for the development of the form and not as advanced as Pachelbel&#x27;s or Böhm&#x27;s contributions to the genre. There are only a few chorale variations, and there are no distinctive qualities that characterize them.

The pieces that do not fall into any of the three types are the keyboard chorale partita &quot;Auf meinen lieben Gott,&quot; BuxWV 179, which, quite unusually for its time, is simultaneously a secular suite of dances and a sacred set of variations with a funerary theme; and the ones based on the chant (Magnificats BuxWV 203–5 and &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot;, BuxWV 218), which are structurally similar to chorale fantasias.

====Ostinato works====
The three ostinato bass works Buxtehude composed—two chaconnes (BuxWV 159–160) and a passacaglia (BuxWV 161)—not only represent, along with Pachelbel&#x27;s six organ chaconnes, a shift from the traditional chaconne style, but are also the first truly developed north German contributions to the development of the genre. They are among Buxtehude&#x27;s best-known works and have influenced numerous composers after him, most notably Bach (whose organ passacaglia is modeled after Buxtehude&#x27;s) and Johannes Brahms. The pieces feature numerous connected sections, with many suspensions, changing meters, and even real modulation (in which the ostinato pattern is transposed into another key).

Some of the praeludia also make use of ostinato models. The praeludium in C major, BuxWV 137, begins with a lengthy pedal solo and concludes not with a postlude of arpeggios and scale runs, but with a comparatively short chaconne built over a three-bar ostinato pattern in the pedal:

The praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 148, in which the ostinato pattern is derived from the subject of one of the fugal sections, also ends in a chaconne. In addition, another praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 149, employs a repeating bass pattern in the beginning.

====Other keyboard works====
The rest of Buxtehude&#x27;s keyboard music does not employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas are the only strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude&#x27;s oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind. There are also three pieces labelled &quot;fugues&quot;: only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 is more of a canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.

There are also 19 harpsichord suites and several variation sets. The suites follow the standard model (Allemande – Sarabande – Courante – Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande or a couple of doubles. Like Froberger&#x27;s, all dances except the gigues employ the French lute style brisé, sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, Johann Mattheson mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.

The several sets of arias with variations are much more developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 &quot;La Capricciosa&quot; may have inspired Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); there are a number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude&#x27;s work and admired him, as has been related above.

<text>Carlos Roque Monzón (7 August 1942 – 8 January 1995), nicknamed Escopeta (&quot;Shotgun&quot;), was an Argentine professional boxer who held the undisputed world middleweight championship for seven years. He successfully defended his title 14 times against 11 different fighters. As of December 2024, he is ranked by BoxRec as the third greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. Known for his speed, punching power and relentless work rate, Monzon ended his career with a record of 87-3-9-1 with 59 knockouts; all of his losses were early in his career and were avenged. Inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990, he was chosen by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine in 2002 as the 11th greatest fighter of the last 80 years and voted him as the best middleweight title holder of the last 50 years in 2011. As of January 2018, Monzón holds the 2nd longest unified championship reign in middleweight history at 9 consecutive defenses. Monzón spent five and a half years in prison for killing his wife Alicia by throwing her off a balcony, and admitted that he had hit every single woman that he had dated.

Argentinians adored Monzón throughout his career. His glamorous and violent life was avidly followed both by the media and Argentine people. He was, however, accused many times of domestic violence by his two wives and many mistresses, and of beating paparazzi. Charged with killing his second wife Alicia Muñiz in 1988, the former champion was sentenced to 11 years in jail. He died in a January 1995 car crash while on his way back to jail after receiving a weekend furlough.

==Early life==

Monzón was born in the city of San Javier, Argentina, to a family of Mocoví descent. His parents were Roque Monzón and Amalia Ledesma. Monzón was raised in poverty with his twelve siblings. When Monzón was six years old, his family moved to Barranquitas Oeste, a poor neighborhood of Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe Province. To help out his family, he quit school in the third grade, working different jobs, such as shoeshiner, paperboy and milkman. As a youngster, he showed an interest in boxing.

When he was sixteen, he met Zulema Encarnación Torres, with whom he had his first son. Later, on 11 May 1962, he married Mercedes Beatriz García, nicknamed &#x27;Pelusa&#x27;. They were so poor that they did not have enough money to buy the marriage license. They had three kids, one of whom was adopted.

==Boxing beginnings==

Monzón had his first amateur fight on 2 October 1959. This first fight ended in a draw. Three years later, after a 73-6-8 amateur record, he became a professional. His first professional bout was held on 6 February 1963. He knocked out his opponent in the second round. In 1966, he won the Argentine middleweight title. In 1967, he won the South American middleweight title. After this success, Argentine boxing promoter Juan Carlos Lectoure pushed him into the international boxing scene by organizing fights with foreign boxers such as Douglas Huntley, Charles Austin, Johnny Brooks, Harold Richardson, Tommy Bethea, Bennie Briscoe (a ten-round tie) Manoel Severino and Eddy Pace.

World middleweight champion Nino Benvenuti had long had a distinguished career that included championships in 2 divisions and 2 wins in 3 bouts vs all-time great Emile Griffith. He had lost the year before to American Tom Bethea in Australia, but in an actual title fight in Yugoslavia, he avenged that loss.

Nobody expected Monzón to beat Benvenuti in their title match (very few knew of him). Yet Monzón applied pressure from the start, and in the 12th, a right hand landed perfectly on Benvenuti&#x27;s chin, and the title changed hands. Monzón also beat Benvenuti in a rematch, this time in only three rounds in Monte Carlo when Benvenuti&#x27;s seconds threw in the towel.

==Champion==
In 1971, Monzón became only the second man to stop former three-time world champion Emile Griffith in 14 rounds, and later out-pointed him over 15 in a close fight (before the fight Monzón had to spar three rounds and run three miles in order to make the weight). Monzón then scored a win over tough Philadelphian Bennie Briscoe in their rematch, over-coming a shakey 9th round, in which Briscoe almost scored a knockout; a knockout in five rounds over European champion Tom Bogs, a knockout in seven rounds over Cuban-Mexican José &quot;Mantequilla&quot; Nápoles in Paris, and a 10-round knockout of tough Tony Licata of New Orleans at the Madison Square Garden, in what would turn out to be Monzón&#x27;s only fight in the United States.

Monzón&#x27;s middleweight championship title was lifted in 1975 by the WBC for not defending it against mandatory challenger Rodrigo Valdez. Valdez, a Colombian, won the WBC&#x27;s title, while Monzón kept the WBA&#x27;s championship. In 1976, they finally met, this time, world champion vs. world champion.

Valdez&#x27;s brother had been shot to death one week prior to the fight and he did not feel like fighting. Still, the fight went on, as they were both under contract. It took place in Monte Carlo. Monzón handed Valdez a beating, winning a 15-round unanimous decision and unifying the world title once again. Facing a lack of good challengers, Monzón was offered a high purse to again fight the Colombian.

The second fight was different. Monzón-Valdez II is a classic. Valdez came out roaring this time. In the second round, right cross to the chin put Monzón down for the first and only time in his career. Valdez built a lead through the first part of the fight. Monzón, however, mounted a brilliant comeback and outboxed Valdez for the last 8 rounds, winning a unanimous decision to retain the title and score his 14th title defense.

==Retirement==
Monzón retired after the second Valdez fight defense. His record stood at 87 wins, only three losses, nine draws and one no contest. Of his wins, 59 came by knockout. All three of his losses were on points, early in his career, and were all avenged. In 2003, he was named by the Ring Magazine as one of the 100 greatest punchers of all time. As of May 2023, BoxRec ranks Monzon as the fifth greatest fighter of all time, pound for pound.

Always known for his overhand right, following Monzón&#x27;s victory over Mantequilla Nápoles, Angelo Dundee said: &quot;Monzón is the complete fighter. He can box, he can hit, he can think, and he is game all the way.&quot;

Before retirement, in 1974, he starred in &quot;La Mary&quot;, a hit movie directed by Daniel Tinayre. After retirement, he participated as an actor in a couple of Argentine movies, which were not very successful, and TV shows.

A monument to him stands in Santa Fe, Argentina.

==Personal life==

While still a champion, a darker side of Monzón began to emerge. In 1973, Monzón was shot in the leg by his then wife of 11 years, Mercedes Beatriz García, with whom he had a daughter and two sons (one of whom was adopted). The shooting required seven hours of surgery to remove the bullet from Monzón&#x27;s leg. In 1975, he began a very publicized romance with Susana Giménez; they had previously met in the 1974 thriller &quot;La Mary&quot;, directed by Daniel Tinayre, where the two played husband and wife. Monzón hated paparazzi who detailed his affairs. He went to Italy with Giménez to participate in a movie, and started increasingly traveling with her to locations in Brazil and the rest of Latin America, allowing himself be seen with her, although still legally married. He was accused of domestic violence and of beating paparazzi.

Monzón was repeatedly detained by the police. Giménez began wearing sunglasses more often, presumably to hide her bruises, and many times, paparazzi had to be hospitalized from the beatings suffered at the hands of Monzón, who had unpredictable violent outbursts. During this period, Monzón and Mercedes Beatriz Garcia finally divorced.

Susana Giménez left him in 1978. After the breakup, Monzón dated Swiss actress Ursula Andress. In 1979, he met Uruguayan model Alicia Muñiz, with whom he had an on-and-off relationship for many years. They eventually married and had a son together, Maximiliano Roque. But his violent behavior continued. On 14 February 1988, while vacationing in the resort city of Mar del Plata, after a heated argument, he beat Muñiz. According to the investigation after this incident, he strangled her into unconsciousness, picked her up, and pushed her off the second floor balcony, killing her, during which he followed her in the fall, injuring his shoulder. On July 3, 1989, Monzón was found guilty of homicide. He received an 11-year prison sentence.

In January 1995, Monzón was given a weekend furlough while serving his term in Cárcel de Las Flores, Santa Fe Province, to visit his family and children. On 8 January 1995, when on his way to returning to jail after the weekend, he and a passenger, Gerónimo Domingo Mottura, were killed instantly when their vehicle rolled over near Santa Rosa de Calchines. The other passenger, Monzón&#x27;s sister-in-law Alicia Guadalupe Fessia, was injured.

Even in death, Monzón drew a crowd. Thousands sang &quot;Dale campeón&quot; (&quot;Go Champ&quot;) during his funeral.

<doc id="87160" wikidata="Q243451" url="?curid=87160" title="Haast's eagle">
<text>Haast&#x27;s eagle (Hieraaetus moorei) is an extinct species of eagle that lived in the South Island of New Zealand, commonly accepted to be the of Māori mythology. It is the largest eagle known to have existed, with an estimated weight of , compared to the next-largest and extant harpy eagle (&quot;Harpia harpyja&quot;), at up to . Its massive size is explained as an evolutionary response to the size of its prey—the flightless moa—the largest of which could weigh . Haast&#x27;s eagle became extinct around 1445, following the arrival of the Māori, who hunted moa to extinction, introduced the Polynesian rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;), and destroyed large tracts of forest by fire.

==Taxonomy==
Haast&#x27;s eagle was first scientifically described by Julius von Haast in 1871 from remains discovered by the Canterbury Museum taxidermist, Frederick Richardson Fuller, in a former marsh. Haast named the eagle &quot;Harpagornis moorei&quot; after George Henry Moore, the owner of the Glenmark Estate, where the bones of the bird were found. The genus name was from the Greek &quot;harpax&quot;, meaning &quot;grappling hook&quot;, and &quot;ornis&quot;, meaning &quot;bird&quot;. DNA analysis later showed that this bird is related most closely to the much smaller little eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus morphnoides&quot;) as well as the booted eagle (&quot;Hieraaetus pennatus&quot;) and not, as previously thought, to the large wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;). &quot;Harpagornis moorei&quot; was therefore reclassified as &quot;Hieraaetus moorei&quot;.

&quot;H. moorei&quot; is estimated to have diverged from these smaller eagles as recently as 1.8 million to 700,000 years ago. If this estimate is correct, its increase in weight by ten to fifteen times is an exceptionally rapid weight increase. The suggested increase in the average weight of Haast&#x27;s eagle over that period would therefore represent the largest, fastest evolutionary increase in average weight of any known vertebrate species. This was made possible in part by the presence of large prey and the absence of competition from other large predators, an example of ecological release and island gigantism. A recent mitochondrial DNA study found it to be more closely related to the little eagle than the booted eagle, with an estimated divergence from the little eagle around 2.2 million years ago. It was placed in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; by recent taxonomists.

==Description==
Haast&#x27;s eagle was one of the largest known true raptors. In length and weight, it was even larger than the largest living vulture (the Andean condor). Another giant bird (not actually an eagle save for in name) more recently and scantily described from the fossil record, the Woodward&#x27;s eagle, which resided in North America, rivaled the Haast&#x27;s in at least the aspect of total length. Female eagles were larger than males. Most estimates place the female Haast&#x27;s eagles in the range of and males around . A comparison with living eagles of the Australasian region resulted in estimated masses in Haast&#x27;s eagles of for males and for females. One source estimates that the largest females could have weighed more than . The largest extant eagles, none of which are verified to exceed in a wild state, are about forty percent smaller in body size than Haast&#x27;s eagles.
It had a relatively short wingspan for its size. It is estimated that the grown female typically spanned up to , possibly up to in a few cases. This wingspan is broadly similar to the larger range of female size in some extant eagles: the wedge-tailed eagle, golden eagle (&quot;A. chrysaetos&quot;), martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;), white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) and Steller&#x27;s sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus pelagicus&quot;) are all known to exceed in wingspan. Several of the largest extant Old World vultures, if not in mean mass or other linear measurements, probably exceed Haast&#x27;s eagle in average wingspan as well. Haast&#x27;s eagle&#x27;s relatively short wingspan has sometimes led to it being incorrectly portrayed as having evolved toward flightlessness, even though evidence strongly suggests that it flew. Instead, its short and broad wings represents an evolutionary departure from the mode of its ancestors&#x27; soaring flight in favour of navigating through a crowded woodland environment. Haast&#x27;s eagles are likely to have hunted within the dense shrubland and forests of New Zealand, somewhat akin to other forest-dwelling raptors like the goshawks or harpy eagle.

Some wing and leg remains of Haast&#x27;s eagles permit direct comparison with living eagles. The harpy eagle, the Philippine eagle (&quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;), and the Steller&#x27;s sea eagle are the largest and most powerful living eagles, and the first two also have a similarly reduced relative wing-length as an adaptation to forest-dwelling. A lower mandible from the Haast&#x27;s eagle measured and the tarsus in several Haast&#x27;s eagle fossils has been measured from . In comparison, the largest beaks of eagles today (from the Philippine and the Steller&#x27;s sea eagle) reach a little more than ; and the longest tarsal measurements (from the Philippine and the Papuan eagle, &quot;Harpyopsis novaeguineae&quot;) top out around .

The talons of the Haast&#x27;s eagle were similar in length to those of the harpy eagle, with a front-left talon length of and a hallux-claw of possibly up to . The Philippine eagle might be a particularly appropriate living species to compare with the Haast&#x27;s eagle, because it too evolved in an insular environment from smaller ancestors (apparently basal snake eagles) to island gigantism in the absence of large carnivorous mammals and other competing predators. The eagle&#x27;s talons are similar to modern eagles, suggesting that it used its talons for hunting and not scavenging. The strong legs and massive flight muscles of these eagles would have enabled the birds to take off with a jumping start from the ground, despite their great weight. The tail was almost certainly long, in excess of in female specimens, and very broad. This characteristic would compensate for the reduction in wing area by providing additional lift. Total length is estimated to have been up to in females, with a standing height of approximately tall or perhaps slightly greater.

Māori cave art depicts the Haast&#x27;s eagle with a pale head. These Māori rock art drawings can still be found in modern-day South Canterbury near Timaru. Combined with its vulture-like feeding behaviour, this might suggest it had a bald head, or had shorter feathers on its head than elsewhere on its body.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Haast&#x27;s eagle predominantly preyed on large, flightless bird species, including the moa, which ultimately led to the species&#x27; extinction. Moa would be up to fifteen times the weight of the eagle. Its large beak also could be used to rip into the internal organs of its prey and death then would have been caused by blood loss. Due to the absence of other large predators or kleptoparasites, a Haast&#x27;s eagle could easily have monopolised a single large kill over a number of days. Its prey, the moa, could weigh up to .

A 2021 analysis showed that, while predatory, the bill of the Haast&#x27;s eagle was functionally closer to that of the Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;) than to that of other eagles. This is also supported by historic Māori Cave art which depicts the Haast&#x27;s eagle being pale-headed. It also suggests that it deployed feeding tactics more similar to those of vultures after making a kill, plunging its head into the body cavity to devour the vital organs of its prey. This may have been an adaptation as a result of the bird hunting animals much larger than itself.

==Extinction==
Until recent human colonisation that introduced rodents and cats, the only placental land mammals found on the islands of New Zealand were three species of bat. Birds occupied or dominated all major niches in the New Zealand animal ecology. Moa were grazers, functionally similar to large ungulates, such as deer or cattle in other habitats, and Haast&#x27;s eagles were the hunters who filled the same niche as top-niche mammalian predators.

One study estimated the total population of Haast&#x27;s eagle at 3,000 to 4,500 breeding pairs. Early Māori settlers arrived in New Zealand sometime between AD 1250 and AD 1275, The Māori preyed heavily on large flightless birds, including all moa species. The added hunting pressure from the Māori led the moa to extinction by around 1440 to 1445. Both eagles and Māori likely competed for the same foods. Unlike the adaptable humans, eagles were dependent on the native medium and large-sized flightless birds, being specialized in hunting them. The loss of its primary prey caused the Haast&#x27;s eagle to become extinct at about the same time as its prey.

==Relationship with humans==

Some believe that these birds are described in many legends of the Māori mythology, under the names &quot;pouākai&quot;, &quot;Hakawai&quot; (or &quot;Hōkioi&quot; in the North Island). According to an account given to Sir George Grey—an early governor of New Zealand—Hōkioi were huge black-and-white birds with yellow-green tinged wings and a red crest. In Māori mythology, Pouākai would prey and kill humans along with moa, which scientists believe could have been possible if the name relates to the eagle, given the massive size and strength of the bird. However, it has also been argued that the &quot;&quot;hakawai&quot; and &quot;hōkioi&quot;&quot; legends refer to the Austral snipe—in particular the extinct South Island species.

== In popular culture==

Artwork depicting Haast&#x27;s eagle now may be viewed at OceanaGold&#x27;s Heritage and Art Park at Macraes, Otago, New Zealand. The sculpture, weighing approximately , standing tall, and depicted with a wingspan of is constructed from stainless steel tube and sheet and was designed and constructed by Mark Hill, a sculptor from Arrowtown, New Zealand. The Haast&#x27;s eagle also appeared in a 2003 BBC documentary &quot;Monsters We Met&quot;.

There is also a statue depicting the Haast&#x27;s eagle in Karamea, West Coast. This statue was unveiled by the community and the Ngāti Waewae iwi.

<text>Lillestrøm Sportsklubb is a Norwegian professional football club based in the city of Lillestrøm, just outside of the capital Oslo. Lillestrøm SK is a Norwegian football club based in Lillestrøm, playing in Eliteserien. The club was founded in 1917, after the merger of two local football clubs. Their home ground is Åråsen Stadion, which has a capacity of 12,250 people, while the principal training ground is Lillestrøm stadion, or the indoor arena, LSK-Hallen. The club holds the Norwegian record for the most consecutive years without being relegated, having played 45 seasons from 1975 until 2019. Over the years the club has had around 40 players who have represented the Norwegian national team. There has also been a number of foreigners who have represented the national teams of the United States, Sweden, Iceland, Senegal, Finland, Malta, Australia, South Africa, Slovenia, Tunisia, Canada, Somalia, and Nigeria.

==History==
Lillestrøm SK was founded on 2 April 1917. It has been Norwegian League champions five times, most recently in 1989, and also in 1986, 1977, 1976 and 1959. Additionally, they have won the Norwegian Cup in 1985, 1981, 1978, 1977, 2007 and 2017.

When Arne Erlandsen left for Sweden and IFK Göteborg after the 2004 season, former LSK player and German international Uwe Rösler took over as head coach of the team. His first season in charge became a successful one, with Lillestrøm finishing fourth in the league. This position secured LSK a place in the Royal League. The team also made it to the 2005 Norwegian Cup final, but lost 4–2 to Molde in front of a crowd of 25,000 at Ullevaal Stadion.

In the 2006 season, Lillestrøm were among the top favourites to win the league. Following a disappointing 4th place, it was announced on 13 November 2006 that Uwe Rösler had been fired from his position as head coach of Lillestrøm. Only a few days later Tom Nordlie signed a three-year contract.
A key signing ahead of the 2007 season included Fredrikstad&#x27;s Simen Brenne, an attacking midfielder with a knack for scoring important goals. LSK under Nordlie played a 4–3–3 system, which invites rapid transitional play between defence and attack, Lillestrøm finished fourth in the league and won the 2007 Norwegian cup, beating Haugesund 2–0 in the final at Ullevaal Stadion.

On 29 May 2008, Tom Nordlie resigned from his position as head coach after a disappointing start of the 2008 season. Statements from Nordlie suggested that fundamental disagreements with club director Jan Åge Fjørtoft also contributed to his resignation. It later emerged that the conflict between the controversial coach and the players was another big contributor behind Nordlie&#x27;s departure, his punishing training regime in the run-up to the 2008 season being cited as the main complaint. Nordlie, no stranger to controversy during his career, had reportedly &quot;lost the dressing room&quot; as early as autumn 2007.

Erland Johnsen and Frode Grodås stepped in as caretakers until a new head coach was hired. On 19 August 2008, the club announced that Henning Berg would take over as head coach on 1 January 2009, after leaving his post at Lyn. Berg&#x27;s first task would be to rescue the team from relegation, a feat he accomplished in his very first match as head coach. LSK beat Rosenborg 4–2 in a classic encounter to secure their place in the Tippeligaen.

The 2009 season was one of great upheaval. In an increasingly tight economic position, LSK sold or released 11 players before and during the season, with Berg also restructuring the squad and bringing in new talent. Enormous injury problems also made the start to the season a difficult one for Berg&#x27;s charges. After 9 games, LSK had won none and drawn four and seemed destined for relegation. An impressive comeback saw Lillestrøm deliver a strong second half to the season, eventually finishing 11th. Newcomer Nosa Igiebor had an especially impressive first season in the Lillestrøm jersey.

The team continued to impress over the course of the winter and start of the 2010 season. LSK were in early June fifth in the Tippeligaen, undefeated in 14 league matches. They saw, however, a dramatic drop in form over the summer which saw them briefly flirt with relegation, before a late surge of form late in the season salvaged 10th place.

In 2011, LSK made an exciting start to the new season, scoring an incredible 18 goals from their first five league matches, including a 7–0 drubbing of Stabæk in their first league match of the season – away from home. Early season form was good enough for the team to flirt with the top three until the end of July. Early in August, however, stars Anthony Ujah and Nosa Igiebor were sold to stave off the dire economic straits of the club. Also, in-form Icelandic midfielder Stefán Gíslason was out of contract and left the club. In mid-August, prodigy striker Björn Bergmann Sigurðarson was injured for the rest of the season, and the club failed to win any of their last 11 league games, a new record for Lillestrøm.

Coach Henning Berg was sacked three matches before the end of the season as investor Per Berg promised fresh funds for acquiring quality players after the season. The club again flirted with the prospect of relegation; however, the incessant poor form of Start and Sarpsborg meant Lillestrøm again saved themselves. This despite an abject 34 points gathered over 30 league matches, which normally would mean relegation.

Former Elfsborg coach Magnus Haglund was appointed coach after the season. Lillestrøm was quite active in the transfer window ahead of the 2012 season, and bought 11 new players. The change of coach and flurry of transfers did the club no good, however, as they again flirted with relegation until just a few weeks before the end of the season, hovering between 12th and 14th place before a strong finish to the season propelled them into 9th. On the whole the season was deemed a big disappointment, however, and Haglund&#x27;s position has been subject to debate throughout the winter pre-season.

Ahead of the 2013 season, the club again has reined in spending and started the season with a first team squad of just 18 full senior players and additional backup players from the youth academy. LSK under Haglund have performed well away from home (2nd best away record in 2012), but often struggled on their own turf.

<text>The 6th arrondissement of Paris (&quot;VIe arrondissement&quot;) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, it is referred to as &quot;le sixième&quot;.

The arrondissement, called Luxembourg in a reference to the seat of the Senate and its garden, is situated on the Rive Gauche of the River Seine. It includes educational institutions such as the , the and the Institut de France, as well as Parisian monuments such as the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe, the Pont des Arts, which links the 1st and 6th arrondissements over the Seine, Saint-Germain Abbey and Saint-Sulpice Church.

This central arrondissement, which includes the historic districts of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (surrounding the abbey founded in the 6th century) and Luxembourg (surrounding the Palace and its Gardens), has played a major role throughout Parisian history. It is well known for its café culture and the revolutionary existentialism intellectualism of the authors that lived there, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gertrude Stein, Paul Éluard, Boris Vian, Albert Camus and Françoise Sagan.

With its cityscape, intellectual tradition, history, architecture and central location, the arrondissement has long been home to French intelligentsia. It is a major locale for art galleries and fashion stores and is one of Paris&#x27;s most expensive areas and one of France&#x27;s richest districts in terms of average income. It is part of what is called &quot;Paris Ouest&quot; (Paris West) alongside the 7th, 8th and 16th arrondissements, as well as the Neuilly-sur-Seine inner suburb.

==History==
The current 6th arrondissement, dominated by the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés—founded in the 6th century—was the heart of the Catholic Church&#x27;s power in Paris for centuries, hosting many religious institutions.
In 1612, Queen Marie de Médicis bought an estate in the district and commissioned architect Salomon de Brosse to transform it into the outstanding Luxembourg Palace surrounded by extensive royal gardens. The new Luxembourg Palace turned the neighbourhood into a fashionable district for French nobility.

In the aftermath of the French Revolution, architect Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin was commissioned to redesign the Luxembourg Palace in 1800 to make it the seat of the newly established Sénat conservateur. Nowadays, the grounds around the Luxembourg Palace, known as the Senate Garden (&quot;Jardin du Sénat&quot;), are open to the public; they have become a prized Parisian garden across from the 5th arrondissement&#x27;s Panthéon.

Since the 1950s, the arrondissement, with its many higher education institutions, cafés (Café de Flore, , La Palette, Café Procope) and publishing houses (Gallimard, Julliard, Grasset) has been the home of much of the major post-war intellectual and literary movements and some of most influential in history such as surrealism, existentialism and modern feminism.
==Geography==


The land area of the arrondissement is , or 532 acres).

<text>Sir Joseph Whitworth, 1st Baronet (21 December 1803 – 22 January 1887) was an English engineer, entrepreneur, inventor and philanthropist. In 1841, he devised the British Standard Whitworth system, which created an accepted standard for screw threads. Whitworth also created the Whitworth rifle, often called the &quot;sharpshooter&quot; because of its accuracy, which is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle, used by some Confederate forces during the American Civil war.

Whitworth was created a baronet by Queen Victoria in 1869. Upon his death in 1887, Whitworth bequeathed much of his fortune for the people of Manchester, with the Whitworth Art Gallery and Christie Hospital partly funded by Whitworth&#x27;s money. Whitworth Street and Whitworth Hall in Manchester are named in his honour.

Whitworth&#x27;s company merged with the W.G. Armstrong &amp; Mitchell Company to become Armstrong Whitworth in 1897.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Whitworth was born in John Street, Stockport, Cheshire, where the Stockport Courthouse is today. The site is marked by a blue plaque on the back wall of the courthouse. He was the son of Charles Whitworth, a teacher and Congregational minister, and at an early age developed an interest in machinery. He was educated at Idle, near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire; his aptitude for mechanics became apparent when he began work for his uncle.

===Career===
After leaving school Whitworth became an indentured apprentice to his uncle, Joseph Hulse, a cotton spinner at Amber Mill, Oakerthorpe in Derbyshire. The plan was that Whitworth would become a partner in the business. From the outset he was fascinated by the mill&#x27;s machinery. Soon, he mastered the techniques of the cotton spinning industry. Even at this age, however, he noticed the poor standards of accuracy and was critical of the milling machinery. This early exposure to the mechanics of the industry forged in him the ambition to make machinery with much greater precision. His apprenticeship at Amber Mill lasted for a four-year term after which he worked for another four years as a mechanic in a factory in Manchester. He then moved to London where he found employment working for Henry Maudslay, the inventor of the screw-cutting lathe, alongside such people as James Nasmyth (inventor of the steam hammer) and Richard Roberts.

Whitworth developed great skill as a mechanic while working for Maudslay, developing various precision machine tools and also introducing a box casting scheme for the iron frames of machine tools that simultaneously increased their rigidity and reduced their weight.

Whitworth also worked for Holtzapffel &amp; Co (makers of lathes used primarily for ornamental turning) and Joseph Clement. While at Clement&#x27;s workshop he helped with the manufacture of Charles Babbage&#x27;s calculating machine, the Difference engine. He returned to Openshaw, 
Manchester, in 1833 to start his own business manufacturing lathes and other machine tools, which became renowned for their high standard of workmanship. Whitworth is attributed with the introduction of the thou in 1844. In 1853, along with his lifelong friend, artist and art educator George Wallis (1811–1891), he was appointed a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. They toured around industrial sites of several American states, and the result of their journey was a report &#x27;The Industry of the United States in Machinery, Manufactures and Useful and Applied Arts, compiled from the Official Reports of Messrs Whitworth and Wallis, London, 1854.&#x27;

Whitworth received many awards for the excellence of his designs and was financially very successful. In 1850, then a President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, he built a house called &#x27;The Firs&#x27; in Fallowfield in south Manchester designed by Edward Walters. In 1854 he bought Stancliffe Hall in Darley Dale, Derbyshire and moved there with his second wife Louisa in 1872. He supplied four six-ton blocks of stone from Darley Dale quarry, for the lions of St George&#x27;s Hall in Liverpool. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1859. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1857.

A strong believer in the value of technical education, Whitworth backed the new Mechanics&#x27; Institute in Manchester (later UMIST) and helped found the Manchester School of Design. In 1868, he founded the Whitworth Scholarship for the advancement of mechanical engineering. He donated a sum of £128,000 to the government in 1868 (approximately £6.5 million in 2010) to bring &quot;science and industry&quot; closer together and to fund scholarships. In 1869, Queen Victoria made Whitworth a baronet.

===Death===
In January 1887 at the age of 83, Sir Joseph Whitworth died in Monte Carlo where he had travelled in the hope of improving his health. He was buried at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Darley Dale, Derbyshire. A detailed obituary was published in the American magazine &quot;The Manufacturer and Builder&quot;. He directed his trustees to spend his fortune on philanthropic projects, which they still do to this day.

===Accuracy and standardisation ===

Whitworth popularised the three-plates method for producing accurate flat surfaces (see Surface plate) during the 1830s, using engineer&#x27;s blue and scraping techniques on three trial surfaces. Up until his introduction of the scraping technique, the same three-plate method was employed using polishing techniques, giving less accurate results. This led to an explosion of development of precision instruments using these flat-surface generation techniques as a basis for further construction of precise shapes.

His next innovation, in 1840, was a measuring technique called &quot;end measurements&quot; that used a precision flat plane and measuring screw, both of his own invention. The system, with a precision of one millionth of an inch (25 nm), was demonstrated at the Great Exhibition of 1851.

In 1841 Whitworth devised a standard for screw threads with a fixed thread angle of 55° and having a standard pitch for a given diameter. This soon became the first nationally standardised system; its adoption by the railway companies, who until then had all used different screw threads, led to its widespread acceptance. It later became a British Standard, &quot;British Standard Whitworth&quot;, abbreviated to BSW and governed by BS 84:1956.

=== Whitworth rifled musket ===

Whitworth was commissioned by the War Department of the British government to design a replacement for the calibre .577-inch Pattern 1853 Enfield, whose shortcomings had been revealed during the recent Crimean War. The Whitworth rifle had a smaller bore of which was hexagonal, fired an elongated hexagonal bullet and had a faster rate of twist rifling [one turn in twenty inches] than the Enfield, and its performance during tests in 1859 was superior to the Enfield&#x27;s in every way. The test was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on 23 April as a great success. However, the new bore design was found to be prone to fouling and it was four times more expensive to manufacture than the Enfield, so it was rejected by the British government, only to be adopted by the French Army. An unspecified number of Whitworth rifles found their way to the Confederate states in the American Civil War, where they were called &quot;Whitworth Sharpshooters&quot;. The rifles were capable of sub-MOA groups at 500 yards. It was often called the &quot;sharpshooter&quot; because of its accuracy, which is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle.

Queen Victoria opened the first meeting of the National Rifle Association at Wimbledon, in 1860 by firing a Whitworth rifle from a fixed mechanical rest. The rifle scored a bull&#x27;s eye at a range of .

===Whitworth rifled cannon breech-loading artillery===
Whitworth also designed a large rifled breech-loading gun with a bore, a projectile and a range of about . The spirally-grooved projectile was patented in 1855. This was rejected by the British Army, who preferred the guns from Armstrong, but was used in the American Civil War.

While trying to increase the bursting strength of his gun barrels, Whitworth patented a process called &quot;fluid-compressed steel&quot; for casting steel under pressure and built a new steel works near Manchester. Some of his castings were shown at the Great Exhibition in Paris .

==Legacy==
=== Scholarships ===
One of the most prominent forms of his generosity was his development of the Whitworth Scholarships with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Still running to this day, this provides financial opportunities for young engineers with a strong blend of academic and practical abilities. The Whitworth Scholarship programmes still exist with 10-15 scholarships being awarded each year. The scholarships are directed at outstanding engineers who, like Sir Joseph Whitworth, have excellent academic and practical skills and the qualities needed to succeed in industry, who are wishing to embark/or have already commenced on an engineering degree-level programme of any engineering discipline. As of 2018, the Scholarship pays up to £5,450 per year for up to four years in the case of a full time undergraduate. The handling and administration of the awards is now carried out by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Since 2006, a Whitworth Senior Scholarship was agreed by the trustees to support Postgraduate Research leading to a MPhil, PhD or EngD.

=== Memorials===

Richard Copley Christie was a friend of Whitworth&#x27;s. By Whitworth&#x27;s will, Christie was appointed one of three legatees, each of whom was left more than half a million pounds for their own use, &#x27;they being each of them aware of the objects&#x27; to which these funds would have been put by Whitworth. They chose to spend more than a fifth of the money on support for Owens College, together with the purchase of land now occupied by the Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 1897, Christie personally assigned more than £50,000 for the erection of the Whitworth Hall, to complete the front quadrangle of Owens College. He was president of the Whitworth Institute from 1890 to 1895 and was much interested in the medical and other charities of Manchester, especially the Cancer Pavilion and Home, of whose committee he was chairman from 1890 to 1893, and which later became the Christie Hospital. Part of his bequest was used to construct the Whitworth Institute in Darley Dale.

The university&#x27;s Whitworth Art Gallery (formerly the Whitworth Institute) and adjacent Whitworth Park were established as part of his bequest to Manchester after his death. Nearby Whitworth Park Halls of Residence also bears his name, as does Whitworth Street, one of the main streets in Manchester city centre, running from London Road to the south end of Deansgate. Near &#x27;The Firs&#x27; a cycleway behind Owens Park is called Whitworth Lane. In Darley Dale is another Whitworth Park. In recognition of his achievements and contributions to education in Manchester, the Whitworth Building on the University of Manchester&#x27;s Main Campus is named in his honour.

=== Whitworth Society ===
In 1923, the Whitworth Society was founded by Prof. Hele-Shaw FRS, then president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers to support all Whitworth Scholars and to promote engineering in the UK. The Society brings together those Whitworth Scholars who have benefited from Sir Joseph Whitworth&#x27;s generosity.

<text>Arachnids are arthropods in the class Arachnida () of the subphylum Chelicerata. Arachnida includes, among others, spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites, pseudoscorpions, harvestmen, camel spiders, whip spiders and vinegaroons.

Adult arachnids have eight legs attached to the cephalothorax. In some species the frontmost pair of legs has converted to a sensory function, while in others, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. 

Almost all extant arachnids are terrestrial, living mainly on land. However, some inhabit freshwater environments and, with the exception of the pelagic zone, marine environments as well. They comprise over 110,000 named species, of which 51,000 are species of spiders.

The term is derived from the Greek word (&quot;aráchnē&quot;, &#x27;spider&#x27;), from the myth of the hubristic human weaver Arachne, who was turned into a spider.

== Morphology ==
Almost all adult arachnids have eight legs, unlike adult insects which all have six legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages that have become adapted for feeding, defense, and sensory perception. The first pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair, the pedipalps, have been adapted for feeding, locomotion, and/or reproductive functions. In scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and ricinuleids the pedipalps end in a pair of pinchers, while in whip scorpions, Schizomida, Amblypygi, and most harvestmen, they are raptorial and used for prey capture. In Solifugae, the palps are quite leg-like, so that these animals appear to have ten legs. The larvae of mites and Ricinulei have only six legs; a fourth pair usually appears when they moult into nymphs. However, mites are variable: as well as eight, there are adult mites with six or, like in Eriophyoidea, even four legs. While the adult males in some members of Podapolipidae have six legs, the adult females have only a single pair.

Arachnids are further distinguished from insects by the fact they do not have antennae or wings. Their body is organized into two tagmata, called the prosoma and opisthosoma, also referred to as the cephalothorax and abdomen. However, there are questions about the validity of the latter terms. While the term &quot;cephalothorax&quot; implies a fused cephalon (head) and thorax, there is currently neither fossil nor embryological evidence that arachnids ever had a separate thorax-like division. Likewise, the &#x27;abdomen&#x27; of many arachnids contains organs atypical of an abdomen, such as a heart and respiratory organs. 

The cephalothorax is usually covered by a single, unsegmented carapace. The abdomen is segmented in the more primitive forms, but varying degrees of fusion between the segments occur in many groups. It is typically divided into a preabdomen and postabdomen, although this is only clearly visible in scorpions, and in some orders, such as the mites, the abdominal sections are completely fused. A telson is present in scorpions, where it has been modified to a stinger, and into a flagellum in the Palpigradi, Schizomida (very short) and whip scorpions. At the base of the flagellum in the two latter groups there are glands which produce acetic acid as a chemical defense. Except for a pair of pectines in scorpions, and the spinnerets in spiders, the abdomen has no appendages.

Like all arthropods, arachnids have an exoskeleton, and they also have an internal structure of cartilage-like tissue, called the , to which certain muscle groups are attached. The endosternite is even calcified in some Opiliones.

==Locomotion==

Most arachnids lack extensor muscles in the distal joints of their appendages. Spiders and whip scorpions extend their limbs hydraulically using the pressure of their hemolymph. Solifuges and some harvestmen extend their knees by the use of highly elastic thickenings in the joint cuticle. Scorpions, pseudoscorpions and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once. The equivalent joints of the pedipalps of scorpions though, are extended by elastic recoil.

==Physiology==

There are characteristics that are particularly important for the terrestrial lifestyle of arachnids, such as internal respiratory surfaces in the form of tracheae, or modification of the book gill into a book lung, an internal series of vascular lamellae used for gas exchange with the air. While the tracheae are often individual systems of tubes, similar to those in insects, ricinuleids, pseudoscorpions, and some spiders possess sieve tracheae, in which several tubes arise in a bundle from a small chamber connected to the spiracle. This type of tracheal system has almost certainly evolved from the book lungs, and indicates that the tracheae of arachnids are not homologous with those of insects.

Further adaptations to terrestrial life are appendages modified for more efficient locomotion on land, internal fertilisation, special sensory organs, and water conservation enhanced by efficient excretory structures as well as a waxy layer covering the cuticle.

The excretory glands of arachnids include up to four pairs of coxal glands along the side of the prosoma, and one or two pairs of Malpighian tubules, emptying into the gut. Many arachnids have only one or the other type of excretory gland, although several do have both. The primary nitrogenous waste product in arachnids is guanine.

Arachnid blood is variable in composition, depending on the mode of respiration. Arachnids with an efficient tracheal system do not need to transport oxygen in the blood, and may have a reduced circulatory system. In scorpions and some spiders, however, the blood contains haemocyanin, a copper-based pigment with a similar function to haemoglobin in vertebrates. The heart is located in the forward part of the abdomen, and may or may not be segmented. Some mites have no heart at all.

==Diet and digestive system==

Arachnids are mostly carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects and other small animals. But ticks, and many mites, are parasites, some of which are carriers of disease. The diet of mites also include tiny animals, fungi, plant juices and decomposing matter. Almost as varied is the diet of harvestmen, where we will find predators, decomposers and omnivores feeding on decaying plant and animal matter, droppings, animals and mushrooms. The harvestmen and some mites, such as the house dust mite, are also the only arachnids able to ingest solid food, which exposes them to internal parasites, although it is not unusual for spiders to eat their own silk. And one species of spider is mostly herbivorous. Scorpions, spiders and pseudoscorpions secrete venom from specialized glands to kill prey or defend themselves. Their venom also contains pre-digestive enzymes that helps breaking down the prey. The saliva of ticks contains anticoagulants and anticomplements, and several species produce a neurotoxin. 

Arachnids produce digestive enzymes in their stomachs, and use their pedipalps and chelicerae to pour them over their dead prey. The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients, which the arachnid sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately in front of the mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, sclerotised pharynx, which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the oesophagus and stomach. In some arachnids, the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump.

The stomach is tubular in shape, with multiple diverticula extending throughout the body. The stomach and its diverticula both produce digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. It extends through most of the body, and connects to a short sclerotised intestine and anus in the hind part of the abdomen.

==Senses==

Arachnids have two kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from compound eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the ectoderm. The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent vitreous body, and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina probably does not have enough light sensitive cells to allow the eyes to form a proper image.

In addition to the eyes, almost all arachnids have two other types of sensory organs. The most important to most arachnids are the fine sensory hairs that cover the body and give the animal its sense of touch. These can be relatively simple, but many arachnids also possess more complex structures, called trichobothria.

Finally, slit sense organs are slit-like pits covered with a thin membrane. Inside the pit, a small hair touches the underside of the membrane, and detects its motion. Slit sense organs are believed to be involved in proprioception, and possibly also hearing.

==Reproduction==
Arachnids may have one or two gonads, which are located in the abdomen. The genital opening is usually located on the underside of the second abdominal segment. In most species, the male transfers sperm to the female in a package, or spermatophore. The males in harvestmen and some mites have a penis. Complex courtship rituals have evolved in many arachnids to ensure the safe delivery of the sperm to the female. Members of many orders exhibit sexual dimorphism.

Arachnids usually lay yolky eggs, which hatch into immatures that resemble adults. Scorpions, however, are either ovoviviparous or viviparous, depending on species, and bear live young. Also some mites are ovoviviparous and viviparous, even if most lay eggs. In most arachnids only the females provide parental care, with harvestmen being one of the few exceptions.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

===Phylogeny===
The phylogenetic relationships among the main subdivisions of arthropods have been the subject of considerable research and dispute for many years. A consensus emerged from about 2010 onwards, based on both morphological and molecular evidence; extant (living) arthropods are a monophyletic group and are divided into three main clades: chelicerates (including arachnids), pancrustaceans (the paraphyletic crustaceans plus insects and their allies), and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and allies). The three groups are related as shown in the cladogram below. Including fossil taxa does not fundamentally alter this view, although it introduces some additional basal groups.
The extant chelicerates comprise two marine groups: Sea spiders and horseshoe crabs, and the terrestrial arachnids. These have been thought to be related as shown below. (Pycnogonida (sea spiders) may be excluded from the chelicerates, which are then identified as the group labelled &quot;Euchelicerata&quot;.) A 2019 analysis nests Xiphosura deeply within Arachnida.

Discovering relationships within the arachnids has proven difficult , with successive studies producing different results. A study in 2014, based on the largest set of molecular data to date, concluded that there were systematic conflicts in the phylogenetic information, particularly affecting the orders Acariformes, Parasitiformes and Pseudoscorpiones, which have had much faster evolutionary rates. Analyses of the data using sets of genes with different evolutionary rates produced mutually incompatible phylogenetic trees. The authors favoured relationships shown by more slowly evolving genes, which demonstrated the monophyly of Chelicerata, Euchelicerata and Arachnida, as well as of some clades within the arachnids. The diagram below summarizes their conclusions, based largely on the 200 most slowly evolving genes; dashed lines represent uncertain placements.

Tetrapulmonata, here consisting of Araneae, Amblypygi and Uropygi (Thelyphonida &quot;s.s.&quot;) (Schizomida was not included in the study), received strong support. Somewhat unexpectedly, there was support for a clade comprising Opiliones, Ricinulei and Solifugae, a combination not found in most other studies. In early 2019, a molecular phylogenetic analysis placed the horseshoe crabs, Xiphosura, as the sister group to Ricinulei. It also grouped pseudoscorpions with mites and ticks, which the authors considered may be due to long branch attraction. The addition of Scorpiones to produce a clade called Arachnopulmonata was also well supported. Pseudoscorpiones may also belong here, as all six orders share the same ancient whole genome duplication, and analyses support pseudoscorpions as the sister group of scorpions. Genetic analysis has not yet been done for Ricinulei, Palpigradi, or Solifugae, but horseshoe crabs have gone through two whole genome duplications, which gives them five Hox clusters with 34 Hox genes, the highest number found in any invertebrate, yet it is not clear if the oldest genome duplication is related to the one in Arachnopulmonata.

More recent phylogenomic analyses that have densely sampled both genomic datasets and morphology have supported horseshoe crabs as nested inside Arachnida, suggesting a complex history of terrestrialization. Morphological analyses including fossils tend to recover the Tetrapulmonata, including the extinct group the Haptopoda, but recover other ordinal relationships with low support.

===Fossil history===

The Uraraneida are an extinct order of spider-like arachnids from the Devonian and Permian.

A fossil arachnid in 100 million year old (mya) amber from Myanmar, &quot;Chimerarachne yingi&quot;, has spinnerets (to produce silk); it also has a tail, like the Palaeozoic Uraraneida, some 200 million years after other known fossils with tails. The fossil resembles the most primitive living spiders, the mesotheles.

===Taxonomy===
The subdivisions of the arachnids are usually treated as orders. Historically, mites and ticks were treated as a single order, Acari. However, molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that the two groups do not form a single clade, with morphological similarities being due to convergence. They are now usually treated as two separate taxa – Acariformes, mites, and Parasitiformes, ticks – which may be ranked as orders or superorders. The arachnid subdivisions are listed below alphabetically; numbers of species are approximate.
;Extant forms
* Acariformes – mites (32,000 species)
* Amblypygi – &quot;blunt rump&quot; tail-less whip scorpions with front legs modified into whip-like sensory structures as long as 25 cm or more (250 species)
* Araneae – spiders (51,000 species)
* Opiliones – phalangids, harvestmen or daddy-long-legs (6,700 species)
* Palpigradi – microwhip scorpions (130 species)
* Parasitiformes – ticks (12,000 species)
* Pseudoscorpionida – pseudoscorpions (4,000 species)
* Ricinulei – ricinuleids, hooded tickspiders (100 species)
* Schizomida – &quot;split middle&quot; whip scorpions with divided exoskeletons (350 species)
* Scorpiones – scorpions (2,700 species)
* Solifugae – solpugids, windscorpions, sun spiders or camel spiders (1,200 species)
* Uropygi (also called Thelyphonida) – whip scorpions or vinegaroons, forelegs modified into sensory appendages and a long tail on abdomen tip (120 species)
;Extinct forms
*†Haptopoda – extinct arachnids apparently part of the Tetrapulmonata, the group including spiders and whip scorpions (1 species)
*†Phalangiotarbida – extinct arachnids of uncertain affinity (30 species)
*†Trigonotarbida – extinct (late Silurian Early Permian)
*†Uraraneida – extinct spider-like arachnids, but with a &quot;tail&quot; and no spinnerets (2 species)

It is estimated that 110,000 arachnid species have been described, and that there may be over a million in total.

<text>The genus Argiope includes rather large spiders that often have a strikingly coloured abdomen. These spiders are distributed throughout the world. Most countries in tropical or temperate climates host one or more species that are similar in appearance. The etymology of &quot;Argiope&quot; is from a Latin word &quot;argentum&quot; meaning silver. The carapace of &quot;Argiope&quot; species is typically covered in silvery hairs, and when crawling in the sun, they reflect it in a way that gives them a metallic, white appearance.

== Description ==
As with most orb weavers, they have a third claw which is used to weave their complex webs. There is significant sexual dimorphism among the various species, with females measuring 19mm-28mm (0.75”-1.1”) and males coming in at 5mm-9mm (0.20”-0.35”). Their webs can be quite large, usually containing a signature zig-zag pattern, called a stabilimentum. They sport black and yellow patterning on their abdomen, and occasionally on their legs, although most species have black legs with red or yellow patterning closer to the body. Their cephalothorax is covered with short silver hairs, and they have an egg-shaped abdomen.

==Common names==


&quot;Argiope bruennichi&quot; is commonly known as the wasp spider. In Australia, &quot;Argiope keyserlingi&quot; and &quot;Argiope aetherea&quot; are known as St Andrew&#x27;s cross spiders, for their habit of resting in the web with paired legs outstretched in the shape of an X and mirroring the large white web decoration (the cross of St. Andrew having the same form). This white zigzag in the centre of its web is called the &quot;stabilimentum&quot; or web decoration.

In North America, &quot;Argiope aurantia&quot; is commonly known as the black and yellow garden spider, zipper spider, corn spider, or writing spider, because of the similarity of the web stabilimenta to writing.

The East Asian species &quot;Argiope amoena&quot; is known in Japan as &quot;kogane-gumo&quot;. In the Philippines, they are known as &quot;gagambang ekis&quot; (&quot;X spider&quot;), and &quot;gagambang pari&quot; (&quot;priest spider&quot;, due to the spider&#x27;s body resembling a priest&#x27;s head with a mitre).

==Web==
The average orb web is practically invisible, and it is easy to blunder into one and end up covered with a sticky web. The visible pattern of banded silk made by &quot;Argiope&quot; is pure white, and some species make an &quot;X&quot; form, or a zigzag type of web (often with a hollow centre). The spider then aligns one pair of its legs with each of the four lines in the hollow &quot;X&quot;, making a complete &quot;X&quot; of white lines with a very eye-catching spider forming its centre.

The zigzag patterns, called stabilimenta, reflect UV light. They have been shown to play a role in attracting prey to the web, and possibly in preventing its destruction by large animals. The centres of their large webs are often just under 1 metre above the ground, so they are too low for anything much larger than a rabbit to walk under. The overtness of the spider and its web thus has been speculated to prevent larger creatures from accidentally destroying the web and possibly crushing the spider underfoot.

Other studies suggest that the stabilimenta may actually lead predators to the spider; species such as &quot;A. keyserlingi&quot; place their web predominantly in closed, complex habitats such as among sedges.

As &quot;Argiope&quot; sit in the centre of their web during the day, they have developed several responses to predators, such as dropping off the web, retreating to the periphery of the web, or even rapidly pumping the web in bursts of up to 30 seconds, similar to the motion done by the unrelated &quot;Pholcus phalangioides&quot;.

==Reproduction==
The male spider is much smaller than the female, and unassumingly marked. When it is time to mate, the male spins a companion web alongside the female&#x27;s. After mating, the female lays her eggs, placing her egg sac into the web. The sac contains between 400 and 1400 eggs.

These eggs hatch in autumn, but the spiderlings overwinter in the sac and emerge during the spring. The egg sac is composed of multiple layers of silk and protects its contents from damage; however, many species of insects have been observed to parasitise the egg sacs.

==Bite==
Like almost all other spiders, &quot;Argiope&quot; are harmless to humans. As is the case with most garden spiders, they eat insects, and they are capable of consuming prey up to twice their size. &quot;A. savigny&quot; was even reported to occasionally feed on the small bat &quot;Rhynchonycteris naso&quot;.

They can potentially bite if grabbed, but other than for defense, they do not attack large animals. Their venom is not regarded as a serious medical problem for humans; it often contains a wide variety of polyamine toxins with potential as therapeutic medicinal agents. Notable among these is the argiotoxin ArgTX-636 (&quot;A. lobata&quot;).

A bite by the black and yellow garden spider (&quot;Argiope aurantia&quot;) is comparable to a bee sting, with redness and swelling. For a healthy adult, a bite is not considered an issue.

Though they are not aggressive spiders, the very young, elderly, those with compromised immune systems, or those with known venom allergies should exercise caution, just as one would around a beehive.

==Taxonomy==
The first description of the genus &quot;Argiope&quot; is attributed to Jean Victoire Audouin in 1826, although he wrote that the genus was established by Savigny. In the first edition of the work in which the description appeared (&quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte: Histoire Naturelle&quot;), Audouin used the spelling &quot;Argyope&quot;, for both the French vernacular name and the Latin generic name. In the second edition, he continued to use &quot;Argyope&quot; for the French vernacular name, but the first mention of the Latin generic name had the spelling &quot;&quot;Argiope&quot;, although the binomial names of the species continued to use &quot;Argyope&quot;. This led to controversy as to whether Audouin had intended to correct the spelling of the generic name, which is derived from the Greek αργιόπη. In 1975, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature validated the spelling &quot;Argiope&quot;&quot;, on the basis that the change from the first to the second edition was an intended correction.

==Injury and pain==
&quot;Argiope&quot; use autotomy – restricting blood flow to their own leg until it falls off – to minimize blood loss due to injury. This is triggered by pain. Honeybee and wasp venoms induce the same pain in &quot;Argiope&quot; – even when the injury is minor – causing &quot;Argiope&quot; to drop the affected leg. The same effect can also be produced by chemically fractionated components of those venoms (specifically serotonin, histamine, and phospholipase A2) that also cause pain in humans.

<doc id="87172" wikidata="Q47667" url="?curid=87172" title="Hu Shih">
<text>Hu Shih (; 17 December 189124 February 1962) was a Chinese academic, writer, and politician. Hu contributed to Chinese liberalism and language reform and was a leading advocate for the use of written vernacular Chinese. He participated in the May Fourth Movement and China&#x27;s New Culture Movement. He was a president of Peking University and Academia Sinica.

Hu was editor of the &quot;Free China Journal&quot;, which was shut down for criticizing Chiang Kai-shek. In 1919, he also criticized Li Dazhao. Hu advocated that the world adopt Western-style democracy. Moreover, Hu criticized Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s claim that people are incapable of self-rule. Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in &quot;The Outline of National Reconstruction&quot;.

Hu wrote many essays attacking communism as a whole, including the political legitimacy of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. Specifically, Hu said that the autocratic dictatorship system of the CCP was &quot;un-Chinese&quot; and against history. In the 1950s, Mao and the Chinese Communist Party launched a campaign criticizing Hu Shih&#x27;s thoughts. After Mao&#x27;s passing, Hu&#x27;s reputation recovered. He is now widely known for his high moral values and influential contribution to Chinese politics and academia.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Hu Shih was born on 17 December 1891, in Shanghai to Hu Chuan (), and his third wife Feng Shundi (). Hu Chuan was a tea merchant who became a public servant, serving in Manchuria, Hainan, and Taiwan. During their marriage, Feng Shun-di was younger than some of Hu Chuan&#x27;s children. After Hu Shih&#x27;s birth, Hu Chuan moved to Taiwan to work in 1892, where his wife and Hu Shih joined him in 1893. Shortly before Hu Chuan&#x27;s death in 1895, right after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, his wife Feng and the young Hu Shih left Taiwan for their ancestral home in Anhui.

In January 1904, when Hu was 11 years old, his mother arranged his marriage to Chiang Tung-hsiu (). In the same year, Hu and an elder brother moved to Shanghai seeking a &quot;modern&quot; education.

=== Academic career ===
Hu became a &quot;national scholar&quot; through funds appropriated from the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. On 16 August 1910, he was sent to study agriculture at Cornell University in the United States. In 1912, he changed his major to philosophy and literature, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was also a member and later a president of the Cosmopolitan Club, an international student organization. While at Cornell, Hu led a campaign to promote the newer, easier to learn Modern Written Chinese which helped spread literacy in China. He also helped found Cornell&#x27;s extensive library collections of East Asian books and materials.

After receiving his undergraduate degree, he went to study philosophy at Teachers College, Columbia University, in New York City, where he was influenced by his professor, John Dewey and started literary experiments. Hu became Dewey&#x27;s translator and a lifelong advocate of pragmatic evolutionary change, helping Dewey in his 1919–1921 lectures series in China. Hu returned to lecture in Peking University. During his tenure there, he received support from Chen Duxiu, editor of the influential journal &quot;New Youth&quot;, quickly gaining much attention and influence. Hu soon became one of the leading and influential intellectuals during the May Fourth Movement and later the New Culture Movement.

Hu quit &quot;New Youth&quot; in the 1920s and published several political newspapers and journals with his friends. His most important contribution was the promotion of vernacular Chinese in literature to replace Classical Chinese, which was intended to make it easier for the ordinary person to read. Hu Shih once said, &quot;A dead language can never produce a living literature.&quot; The significance of this for Chinese culture was greatas John Fairbank put it, &quot;the tyranny of the classics had been broken.&quot; Hu devoted a great deal of energy to rooting his linguistic reforms in China&#x27;s traditional culture rather than relying on imports from the West. As his biographer Jerome Grieder put it, Hu&#x27;s approach to China&#x27;s &quot;distinctive civilization&quot; was &quot;thoroughly critical but by no means contemptuous.&quot; For instance, he studied Chinese classical novels, especially the 18th century novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, as a way of establishing the vocabulary for a modern standardized language. His Peking University colleague Wen Yuan-ning dubbed Hu a &quot;Philosophe&quot; for his humanistic interests and expertise.

Hu was among the New Culture Movement reformers who welcomed Margaret Sanger&#x27;s 1922 visit to China. He personally translated her speech delivered at Beijing National University which stressed the importance of birth control. Periodicals &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Journal&quot; and &quot;The Women&#x27;s Review&quot; published Hu&#x27;s translation.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932 and the American Philosophical Society in 1936.

=== Public service ===
Hu was the Republic of China&#x27;s ambassador to the United States from 1938 to 1942. He was recalled in September 1942 and was replaced by Wei Tao-ming. Hu then served as chancellor of Peking University, at the time called National Peking University, between 1946 and 1948. In 1957, he became the third president of the Academia Sinica in Taipei, a post he retained until his death. He was also chief executive of the &quot;Free China Journal&quot;, which was eventually shut down for criticizing Chiang Kai-shek.

=== Death and legacy ===

He died of a heart attack in Nankang, Taipei at the age of 70, and was entombed in Hu Shih Park, adjacent to the Academia Sinica campus. That December, Hu Shih Memorial Hall was established in his memory. It is an affiliate of the Institute of Modern History at the Academia Sinica, and includes a museum, his residence, and the park. Hu Shih Memorial Hall offers audio tour guides in Chinese and English for visitors.

Hu Shih&#x27;s work fell into disrepute in mainland China until an 1986 article written by Ji Xianlin, &quot;A Few Words for Hu Shih&quot; (), acknowledged Hu Shih&#x27;s mistakes. This article was sufficiently convincing to many scholars that it led to a re-evaluation of the development of modern Chinese literature. Selection 15 of the Putonghua Proficiency Test is a story about Hu Shih debating the merits of written vernacular Chinese over Literary Chinese.

Hu also claimed that India conquered China culturally for 2000 years via religion. At the same time, Hu criticized Indian religions for holding China back scientifically.

Including redology, he had a wide range of interests in literature, philosophy, history, textual criticism, and pedagogy. Feng Youlan criticized Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework and ignoring all the schools of Chinese philosophy before the Warring States period. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu made the reader feel as if &quot;the whole Chinese civilization is entirely on the wrong track.&quot; Before Feng, Hu might have been the first to interpret the concept of the Tao through modern Western philosophy.

As &quot;one of Cornell University&#x27;s most notable Chinese alumni&quot;, Hu has several honors there, including the Hu Shih Professorship and Hu Shih Distinguished lecture. Hu Shih Hall, a residence hall, was dedicated at Cornell in 2022.

== Contributions to philosophy ==
=== Pragmatism ===
During his time at Columbia, Hu became a supporter of the school of Pragmatism. Hu translated &quot;Pragmatism&quot; as . Hu&#x27;s taking to the thinking reflected his own philosophical appeals. Before he encountered Dewey&#x27;s works, he wrote in his diary that he was in a search of &quot;practical philosophy&quot; for the survival of the Chinese people, rather than deep and obscure systems. He was interested in . Hu viewed Pragmatism as a scientific methodology for the study of philosophy. He appreciated the universality of such a scientific approach because he believed that such a methodology transcends the boundary of culture and therefore can be applied anywhere, including China during his time. Hu Shih was not so interested in the content of Dewey&#x27;s philosophy, caring rather about the method, the attitude, and the scientific spirit.

Hu saw all ideologies and abstract theories only as hypotheses waiting to be tested. The content of ideologies, Hu believed, was shaped by the background, political environment, and even the personality of the theorist. Thus these theories were confined within their temporality. Hu felt that only the attitude and spirit of an ideology could be universally applied. Therefore, Hu criticized any dogmatic application of ideologies. After Hu took over as the chief editor at Weekly Commentary () in 1919, he criticized Li Dazhao and engaged in a heated debate regarding ideology and problem (). Hu writes in &quot;A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms&quot; ():Throughout the literary works and other scholarships of Hu Shih, the presence of Pragmatism as a method is prevalent. Hu Shih avoided using an ill-defined scientific method. He described his own as experiential, inductive, verification-oriented, and evolutionary.

Hu quotes Dewey&#x27;s division of thought into five steps:
# A felt difficulty
# Its location and definition
# Suggestion of possible solution
# Development of the suggestions
# Further observation and experiment leads to acceptance or rejection.

Hu saw his life work as a consistent project of practicing the scientific spirit of Pragmatism as a lifestyle.

=== Skepticism ===
For Hu Shih, skepticism and pragmatism are inseparable. In his essay &quot;Introducing My Thoughts&quot; (), he states that Thomas H. Huxley is the one person who most heavily influenced his thoughts. Huxley&#x27;s agnosticism is the negative precondition to the practical, active problem-solving of Dewey&#x27;s pragmatism. Huxley&#x27;s &quot;genetic method&quot; in Hu&#x27;s writing becomes a &quot;historical attitude&quot;, an attitude that ensures one&#x27;s intellectual independence which also leads to individual emancipation and political freedom.

=== Chinese intellectual history ===
Hu Shih brought the scientific method and the spirit of Skepticism into traditional Chinese textual study (&quot;kaozheng&quot;), laying the groundwork for contemporary studies of Chinese intellectual history.

In 1919, Hu Shih published the first volume of &quot;An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy.&quot; The later portion was never finished. Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University where Hu was teaching at the time, wrote the preface for &quot;Outline&quot; and pointed out four key features of Hu&#x27;s work:

# Method of proving for dates, validity, and perspectives of methodology
# &quot;Cutting off the many schools&quot; (), meaning ignoring all schools before the time of Warring States period and starting with Laozi and Confucius
# Equal treatment for Confucianism, Mohism, Mencius, and Xunzi
# Systematic studies with chronological orders and juxtaposition that present the evolution of theories

Hu&#x27;s organization of classical Chinese philosophy imitated Western philosophical history, but the influence of textual study since the time of the Qing dynasty is still present. Especially for the second point, &quot;cutting off the many schools&quot; is a result of the continuous effort of Qing scholarship around ancient textual studies. Since the validity of the ancient texts is questionable and the content of them obscure, Hu decided to leave them out. In fact, before the publication of &quot;Outline&quot;, Hu was appointed to be the lecturer of History of Classical Chinese Philosophy. His decision of leaving out pre-Warring States philosophy almost caused a riot among students.

In &quot;Outline&quot;, other philosophical schools of the Warring States were first treated as equal. Hu did not hold Confucianism as the paradigm while treating other schools as heresy. Rather, Hu saw philosophical values within other schools, even those considered to be anti-Confucian, like Mohism. Yu Yingshi commented how this paradigm followed Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s Enlightenment theory.

Feng Youlan, the author of &quot;A History of Chinese Philosophy&quot;, criticizes Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework in &quot;Outline&quot;. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu criticizes these schools from a pragmatist perspective which makes the reader feel as if &quot;the whole Chinese civilization is entirely on the wrong track.&quot; Feng also disagrees with Hu&#x27;s extensive effort on researching the validity of the resource text. Feng believes that as long as the work itself is philosophically valuable, its validity is not as significant.

== Political views ==

=== Individualism, liberalism, and democracy ===
Unlike many of his contemporaries who later joined the Socialist camp, liberalism and democracy had been Hu&#x27;s political beliefs throughout his life. He firmly believed that the world as a whole was heading toward democracy, despite the changing political landscape. Hu defines democracy as a lifestyle in which everyone&#x27;s value is recognized, and everyone has the freedom to develop a lifestyle of individualism. For Hu, individual achievement does not contradict societal good. In fact, individual achievement contributes to overall social progress, a view that differs from the so-called &quot;selfish individualism.&quot; In his essay, &quot;ImmortalityMy Religion&quot;, Hu stresses that although individuals eventually perish physically, one&#x27;s soul and the effect one has on society are immortal. Therefore, Hu&#x27;s individualism is a lifestyle in which people are independent and yet social.

Hu sees individual contributions as crucial and beneficial to the system of democracy. In &quot;A Second Discussion on Nation-Building and Autocracy&quot; (), Hu comments that an autocratic system needs professionals to manage it while democracy relies on the wisdom of the people. When different people&#x27;s lived experiences come together, no elite politician is needed for coordination, and therefore democracy is, in fact, easy to practice with people who lack political experience. He calls democracy &quot;naive politics&quot; (), a political system that can help cultivate those who participate in it.

Hu also equates democracy with freedom, a freedom that is made possible by tolerance. In a democratic system, people should be free from any political persecution as well as any public pressure. In his 1959 essay &quot;Tolerance and Freedom&quot;, Hu Shih stressed the importance of tolerance and claimed that &quot;tolerance is the basis of freedom&quot;. In a democratic society, the existence of opposition must be tolerated. Minority rights are respected and protected. People must not destroy or silence the opposition.

==== The Chinese root of democracy ====
A large portion of Hu Shih&#x27;s scholarship in his later years is dedicated to finding a Chinese root for democracy and liberalism. Many of his writings, including &quot;Historic Tradition for a Democratic China&quot;, &quot;The Right to Doubt in Ancient Chinese Thought&quot;, &quot;Authority and Freedom in the Ancient Asian World&quot; make a similar claim that the democratic spirit is always present within the Chinese tradition. He claimed that Chinese tradition included:

# A democratized social structure with an equal inheritance system among sons and the right to rebel under oppressive regimes.
# Widespread accessibility of political participation through civil service exams.
# Intragovernmental criticism and censorial control formalized by governmental institutions and the Confucian tradition of political criticism.

=== Constitutionalism and human rights movement ===
In 1928, Hu along with Wen Yiduo, Chen Yuan, Liang Shih-chiu, and Xu Zhimo founded the monthly journal &quot;Crescent Moon&quot;, named after Tagore&#x27;s prose verse. In March 1929, he learned from Shanghai Special Representatives of National Party Chen De.

Hu criticized and rejected Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s claim that people are incapable of self-rule and considered democracy itself a form of political education. The legitimacy and the competency of people participating in the political process comes from their lived experience. Sun&#x27;s government also proposed to punish any &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot; without due process.

Hu wrote an article in &quot;Crescent Moon&quot; titled &quot;Human Rights and Law&quot; (). In the article, Hu called for the establishment of a written constitution that protects the rights of citizens, especially from the ruling government. The government must be held accountable to the constitution. Later in &quot;When Can We Have ConstitutionA Question for &quot;The Outline of National Reconstruction&quot;&quot; (), Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in &quot;The Outline of National Reconstruction&quot;.

=== Criticism of the Communist Party after 1949 ===

In the early 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party launched a years-long campaign criticizing Hu&#x27;s thoughts. In response, Hu published many essays in English attacking the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party.

In the writing field, Lu Xun and Hu represented two different political parties. The political differences between the Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party led to significantly different evaluations of the two writers. As a supporter of the Communist Party, Lu Xun was hailed by its leader Mao Zedong as &quot;the greatest and most courageous fighter of the new cultural army&quot;. By contrast, Hu Shih was criticized by Communist-leaning historians as &quot;the earliest, the most persistent and most uncompromising enemy of Chinese Marxism and socialist thought&quot;. The different evaluations of the two different writers show the complexity between two different political parties in modern China.

Hu&#x27;s opposition to the Chinese Communist Party was an ideological conflict. As a supporter of Pragmatism, Hu believed that social changes could only happen incrementally. Revolution or any ideologies that claim to solve social problems once and for all are not possible. Such a perspective was present in his early writing, as in the &quot;problem&quot; versus &quot;isms&quot; debate. He quotes John Dewey: &quot;progress is not a wholesale matter, but a retail job, to be contracted for and executed in section&quot;.

Hu also opposed communism because of his ideological belief in individualism. Hu affirms the individual&#x27;s right as independent from the collective. The individual has the right to develop freely and diversely without political suppression in the name of uniformity. He writes in &quot;The Conflict of Ideologies&quot;:
In contrast to a Marxist vision of history, Hu&#x27;s conception of history is pluralistic and particular. In his talk with American economist Charles A. Beard, recorded in his diary, Hu believed the making of history is only coincidental. Since he is a proponent of reformism, pluralism, individualism, and skepticism, Hu&#x27;s philosophy is irreconcilable with Communist ideology. Hu&#x27;s later scholarship around the Chinese root of liberalism and democracy is consistent with his anti-CCP writings. In a later manuscript titled &quot;Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern&quot;, Hu constructs three arguments from Chinese intellectual history, especially from Confucian and Taoist traditions, to combat the authoritative rule of the Chinese Communist Party:

Therefore, Hu regards the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party as not only &quot;unhistorical&quot;, but also &quot;un-Chinese&quot;.

=== Global policy ===
Along with Albert Einstein, Hu was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place from 1950 to 1951 at Palais Electoral in Geneva, Switzerland.

== Writings ==
=== Essays ===
Hu was an advocate for the literary revolution of the era, a movement which aimed to replace scholarly classical Chinese in writing with the vernacular spoken language, and to cultivate and stimulate new forms of literature. In an article originally published in &quot;New Youth&quot; in January 1917 titled &quot;A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform&quot;, Hu originally emphasized eight guidelines that all Chinese writers should take to heart in writing:

# Write with substance. By this, Hu meant that literature should contain real feeling and human thought. This was intended to be a contrast to the recent poetry with rhymes and phrases that Hu saw as being empty.
# Do not imitate the ancients. Literature should not be written in the styles of long ago, but rather in the modern style of the present era.
# Respect grammar. Hu did not elaborate at length on this point, merely stating that some recent forms of poetry had neglected proper grammar.
# Reject melancholy. Recent young authors often chose grave pen names, and wrote on such topics as death. Hu rejected this way of thinking as being unproductive in solving modern problems.
# Eliminate old clichés. The Chinese language has always had numerous &quot;chengyu&quot; used to describe events. Hu implored writers to use their own words in descriptions, and deplored those who did not.
# Do not use allusions. By this, Hu was referring to the practice of comparing present events with historical events even when there is no meaningful analogy.
# Do not use couplets or parallelism. Though these forms had been pursued by earlier writers, Hu believed that modern writers first needed to learn the basics of substance and quality, before returning to these matters of subtlety and delicacy.
# Do not avoid popular expressions or popular forms of characters. This rule, perhaps the most well-known, ties in directly with Hu&#x27;s belief that modern literature should be written in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. He believed that this practice had historical precedents, and led to greater understanding of important texts.

In April 1918, Hu published a second article in &quot;New Youth&quot;, this one titled &quot;Constructive Literary Revolution – A Literature of National Speech&quot;. In it, he simplified the original eight points into just four:

# Speak only when you have something to say. This is analogous to the first point above.
# Speak what you want to say and say it in the way you want to say it. This combines points two through six above.
# Speak what is your own and not that of someone else. This is a rewording of point seven.
# Speak in the language of the time in which you live. This refers again to the replacement of Classical Chinese with the vernacular language.

In the 15 July &quot;New Youth&quot; issue, Hu published an essay entitled, &quot;Chastity&quot; (). In the traditional Chinese context, this refers not only to virginity before marriage, but specifically to women remaining chaste before they marry and after their husband&#x27;s death (). He wrote that this is an unequal and illogical view of life, that there is no natural or moral law upholding such a practice, that chastity is a mutual value for both men and women, and that he vigorously opposes any legislation favoring traditional practices on chastity. There was a movement to introduce traditional Confucian value systems into law at the time.

His 1947 essay &quot;We Must Choose Our Own Direction&quot; () was devoted to liberalism. He held the Jiaxu manuscript () for many years until his death.

=== Academic works ===
Among academic works of Hu Shih are:
* &quot;An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy&quot;. Vol. 1 (1919).
* &quot;The Chinese Renaissance: The Haskell Lectures, 1933&quot;. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934).
* &quot;Hu Shih&#x27;s Recent Writings on Scholarship&quot; (). (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1935). Including essay &quot;Introducing My Thoughts&quot; ().
* &quot;The Conflicts of Ideologies&quot; in &quot;The Annuals of American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot;, Vol. 28, November 1941.

=== Autobiography ===
The 184-page &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; () is the only autobiography written by Hu Shih himself.

=== Fiction prose and poetry ===
In 1920, Hu Shih published the collection of his poems &quot;Experiments&quot; (&quot;Changshi ji&quot;).

The following excerpt is from a poem titled &quot;Dream and Poetry&quot;, written in vernacular Chinese by Hu. It illustrates how he applied those guidelines to his own work.
His prose included works like &quot;The Life of Mr. Close Enough&quot; (), a piece criticizing Chinese society which centers around the extremely common Chinese language phrase (), which means something like &quot;close enough&quot; or &quot;just about right&quot;:

The &quot;Marriage&quot; () was one of the first plays written in the new literature style. Published in the March 1919 issue (Volume 6 Number 3) of &quot;New Youth&quot;, this Hu Shih&#x27;s one-act play highlights the problems of traditional marriages arranged by parents. The female protagonist eventually leaves her family to escape the marriage in the story.

== Vernacular style ==
Hu Shih was part of the Chinese language reform movement and used the vernacular style in writing articles. The opposite style of writing is Classical Chinese, and one of the key leaders of this language was Zhang Shizhao. Hu Shih and Zhang Shizhao had only a ten-year age difference, but the men seemed to be of differing generations.

In October 1919, after visiting in China, Hu Shih said with emotion: &quot;In the last ten years, only deceased personalities like Song Jiaoren, Cai E, and Wu Luzhen have been able to maintain their great reputation. The true features of living personalities are soon detected. This is because the times change too quickly. If a living personality does not try his utmost, he falls behind and soon becomes &quot;against the time&quot;. In Hu Shih&#x27;s ideals, only dead people can hold their reputation; the world will soon know the real value and personality of a person if they do not follow the times. They will fall back in time soon if they are not trying to find changes that encourage writers in old China to follow the new revolution and start using the new vernacular style of writing. They cannot stay in the old style; otherwise, they will fall back in time. Furthermore, Hu Shih meant that China needed more new things.

Zhang was the biggest &#x27;enemy&#x27; of the vernacular style, According to Liang Souming: &quot;Lin Shu and Zhang Shizhao were two most significant people against vernacular style of writing in history&quot;. But in fact, Hu Shih and Zhang Shizhao had a big age difference; when Zhang was at work in Shanghai, Hu was only a middle school student.

== May Fourth Movement ==
Hu Shih participated in the May Fourth Movement, marking the beginning of modern China. Hu had a vision of the May Fourth Movement in China as part of a global shift in philosophy, led by Western countries. The global nature of the movement, in Hu&#x27;s eyes, was particularly important, given China&#x27;s relatively recent status as a global power. During the May Fourth Movement, Hu&#x27;s political position shifted dramatically. As fellow thinkers and students of the movement looked towards socialism, Hu also gained a more favorable view of the collective, centralized organization of groups like the Soviet Union and the Third International. After the early 1930s, he changed back to his earlier positions, which put more weight on individualism. Hu then began criticizing communism such as Mao&#x27;s government and the Soviet Union. During the chaotic period this movement developed, Hu felt pessimism and a sense of alienation.

Towards the end of Hu&#x27;s life, he expressed disappointment at the politicization of the May Fourth Movement, which he felt was counter to the primarily philosophical and linguistic issues that drove him to participate in it. No matter how Hu&#x27;s position shifted through the course of the Movement, he always put the May Fourth Movement in a global, albeit Eurocentric, context. Despite the implications of the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih ultimately expressed regret that he was unable to play a larger role in his nation&#x27;s history.

<doc id="87175" wikidata="Q736798" url="?curid=87175" title="Herd immunity">
<text>Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or mass immunity) is a form of indirect protection that applies only to contagious diseases. It occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination, that the communicable pathogen cannot maintain itself in the population, its low incidence thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity.

Once the herd immunity has been reached, disease gradually disappears from a population and may result in eradication or permanent reduction of infections to zero if achieved worldwide. Herd immunity created via vaccination has contributed to the reduction of many diseases.

==Effects==
===Protection of those without immunity===

Some individuals either cannot develop immunity after vaccination or for medical reasons cannot be vaccinated. Newborn infants are too young to receive many vaccines, either for safety reasons or because passive immunity renders the vaccine ineffective. Individuals who are immunodeficient due to HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, leukemia, bone marrow cancer, an impaired spleen, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy may have lost any immunity that they previously had and vaccines may not be of any use for them because of their immunodeficiency.

A portion of those vaccinated may not develop long-term immunity. Vaccine contraindications may prevent certain individuals from being vaccinated. In addition to not being immune, individuals in one of these groups may be at a greater risk of developing complications from infection because of their medical status, but they may still be protected if a large enough percentage of the population is immune.

High levels of immunity in one age group can create herd immunity for other age groups. Vaccinating adults against pertussis reduces pertussis incidence in infants too young to be vaccinated, who are at the greatest risk of complications from the disease. This is especially important for close family members, who account for most of the transmissions to young infants. In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings. Vaccinating children against pneumococcus and rotavirus has had the effect of reducing pneumococcus- and rotavirus-attributable hospitalizations for older children and adults, who do not normally receive these vaccines. Influenza (flu) is more severe in the elderly than in younger age groups, but influenza vaccines lack effectiveness in this demographic due to a waning of the immune system with age. The prioritization of school-age children for seasonal flu immunization, which is more effective than vaccinating the elderly, however, has been shown to create a certain degree of protection for the elderly.

For sexually transmitted infections (STIs), high levels of immunity in heterosexuals of one sex induces herd immunity for heterosexuals of both sexes. Vaccines against STIs that are targeted at heterosexuals of one sex result in significant declines in STIs in heterosexuals of both sexes if vaccine uptake in the target sex is high. Herd immunity from female vaccination does not, however, extend to males who have sex with males. High-risk behaviors make eliminating STIs difficult because, even though most infections occur among individuals with moderate risk, the majority of transmissions occur because of individuals who engage in high-risk behaviors. For this reason, in certain populations it may be necessary to immunize high-risk individuals regardless of sex.

===Evolutionary pressure and serotype replacement===
Herd immunity itself acts as an evolutionary pressure on pathogens, influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains, referred to as escape mutants, that are able to evade herd immunity and infect previously immune individuals. The evolution of new strains is known as serotype replacement, or serotype shifting, as the prevalence of a specific serotype declines due to high levels of immunity, allowing other serotypes to replace it.

At the molecular level, viruses escape from herd immunity through antigenic drift, which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus&#x27;s surface antigen, typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or antigenic shift, which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so people are not immune to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce herd immunity until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics. As this evolution poses a challenge to herd immunity, broadly neutralizing antibodies and &quot;universal&quot; vaccines that can provide protection beyond a specific serotype are in development.

Initial vaccines against &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; significantly reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes (VTs), including antibiotic-resistant types, only to be entirely offset by increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs). This did not result in a proportionate increase in disease incidence though, since NVTs were less invasive than VTs. Since then, pneumococcal vaccines that provide protection from the emerging serotypes have been introduced and have successfully countered their emergence. The possibility of future shifting remains, so further strategies to deal with this include expansion of VT coverage and the development of vaccines that use either killed whole-cells, which have more surface antigens, or proteins present in multiple serotypes.

===Eradication of diseases===
If herd immunity has been established and maintained in a population for a sufficient time, the disease is inevitably eliminatedno more endemic transmissions occur. If elimination is achieved worldwide and the number of cases is permanently reduced to zero, then a disease can be declared eradicated. Eradication can thus be considered the final effect or end-result of public health initiatives to control the spread of contagious disease. In cases in which herd immunity is compromised, on the contrary, disease outbreaks among the unvaccinated population are likely to occur.

The benefits of eradication include ending all morbidity and mortality caused by the disease, financial savings for individuals, health care providers, and governments, and enabling resources used to control the disease to be used elsewhere. To date, two diseases have been eradicated using herd immunity and vaccination: rinderpest and smallpox. Eradication efforts that rely on herd immunity are currently underway for poliomyelitis, though civil unrest and distrust of modern medicine have made this difficult. Mandatory vaccination may be beneficial to eradication efforts if not enough people choose to get vaccinated.

==Free riding==
Herd immunity is vulnerable to the free rider problem. Individuals who lack immunity, including those who choose not to vaccinate, free ride off the herd immunity created by those who are immune. As the number of free riders in a population increases, outbreaks of preventable diseases become more common and more severe due to loss of herd immunity. Individuals may choose to free ride or be hesitant to vaccinate for a variety of reasons, including the belief that vaccines are ineffective, or that the risks associated with vaccines are greater than those associated with infection, mistrust of vaccines or public health officials, bandwagoning or groupthinking, social norms or peer pressure, and religious beliefs. Certain individuals are more likely to choose not to receive vaccines if vaccination rates are high enough to convince a person that he or she may not need to be vaccinated, since a sufficient percentage of others are already immune.

==Mechanism==
Individuals who are immune to a disease act as a barrier in the spread of disease, slowing or preventing the transmission of disease to others. An individual&#x27;s immunity can be acquired via a natural infection or through artificial means, such as vaccination. When a critical proportion of the population becomes immune, called the &quot;herd immunity threshold&quot; (HIT) or &quot;herd immunity level&quot; (HIL), the disease may no longer persist in the population, ceasing to be endemic.

The theoretical basis for herd immunity generally assumes that vaccines induce solid immunity, that populations mix at random, that the pathogen does not evolve to evade the immune response, and that there is no non-human vector for the disease.

==Theoretical basis==


The critical value, or threshold, in a given population, is the point where the disease reaches an endemic steady state, which means that the infection level is neither growing nor declining exponentially. This threshold can be calculated from the effective reproduction number &quot;R&quot;e, which is obtained by taking the product of the basic reproduction number &quot;R&quot;0, the average number of new infections caused by each case in an entirely susceptible population that is homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning each individual is equally likely to come into contact with any other susceptible individual in the population, and &quot;S&quot;, the proportion of the population who are susceptible to infection, and setting this product to be equal to 1:

: formula_1

&quot;S&quot; can be rewritten as (1 − &quot;p&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; is the proportion of the population that is immune so that &quot;p&quot; + &quot;S&quot; equals one. Then, the equation can be rearranged to place &quot;p&quot; by itself as follows:

: formula_2
: formula_3
: formula_4

With &quot;p&quot; being by itself on the left side of the equation, it can be renamed as &quot;p&quot;c, representing the critical proportion of the population needed to be immune to stop the transmission of disease, which is the same as the &quot;herd immunity threshold&quot; HIT. &quot;R&quot;0 functions as a measure of contagiousness, so low &quot;R&quot;0 values are associated with lower HITs, whereas higher &quot;R&quot;0s result in higher HITs. For example, the HIT for a disease with an &quot;R&quot;0 of 2 is theoretically only 50%, whereas a disease with an &quot;R&quot;0 of 10 the theoretical HIT is 90%.

When the effective reproduction number &quot;R&quot;e of a contagious disease is reduced to and sustained below 1 new individual per infection, the number of cases occurring in the population gradually decreases until the disease has been eliminated. If a population is immune to a disease in excess of that disease&#x27;s HIT, the number of cases reduces at a faster rate, outbreaks are even less likely to happen, and outbreaks that occur are smaller than they would be otherwise. If the population immunity falls below the herd immunity threshold, where the effective reproduction number increases to above 1, the population is said to have an &quot;immunity gap&quot;, and then the disease is neither in a steady state nor decreasing in incidence, but is actively spreading through the population and infecting a larger number of people than usual. 

An assumption in these calculations is that populations are homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning that every individual is equally likely to come into contact with any other individual, when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together, remaining in relatively close contact with a limited number of other individuals. In these networks, transmission only occurs between those who are geographically or physically close to one another. The shape and size of a network is likely to alter a disease&#x27;s HIT, making incidence either more or less common. Mathematical models can use contact matrices to estimate the likelihood of encounters and thus transmission.

In heterogeneous populations, &quot;R&quot;0 is considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a &quot;typical&quot; contagious person, which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other. Interactions within networks are more common than between networks, in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily, resulting in a higher &quot;R&quot;0 and a higher HIT than would be required in a less connected network. In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently, diseases may persist despite not existing in better-immunized networks.
===Overshoot===
The cumulative proportion of individuals who get infected during the course of a disease outbreak can exceed the HIT. This is because the HIT does not represent the point at which the disease stops spreading, but rather the point at which each infected person infects fewer than one additional person on average. When the HIT is reached, the number of additional infections does not immediately drop to zero. The excess of the cumulative proportion of infected individuals over the theoretical HIT is known as the overshoot.

==Boosts==
===Vaccination===

The primary way to boost levels of immunity in a population is through vaccination. Vaccination is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the cowpox virus began as a way to prevent smallpox. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections.

The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to both, so immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve herd immunity through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates, and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, which decreases the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.

Assuming a vaccine is 100% effective, then the equation used for calculating the herd immunity threshold can be used for calculating the vaccination level needed to eliminate a disease, written as &quot;V&quot;c. Vaccines are usually imperfect however, so the effectiveness, &quot;E&quot;, of a vaccine must be accounted for:

: formula_5

From this equation, it can be observed that if &quot;E&quot; is less than (1 − 1/&quot;R&quot;0), then it is impossible to eliminate a disease, even if the entire population is vaccinated. Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity, as occurs with acellular pertussis vaccines, requires higher levels of booster vaccination to sustain herd immunity. If a disease has ceased to be endemic to a population, then natural infections no longer contribute to a reduction in the fraction of the population that is susceptible. Only vaccination contributes to this reduction. The relation between vaccine coverage and effectiveness and disease incidence can be shown by subtracting the product of the effectiveness of a vaccine and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, &quot;p&quot;v, from the herd immunity threshold equation as follows:

: formula_6

It can be observed from this equation that, all other things being equal (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;), any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including any increase in excess of a disease&#x27;s HIT, further reduces the number of cases of a disease. The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease&#x27;s &quot;R&quot;0, with diseases with lower &quot;R&quot;0 values experiencing sharper declines.

Vaccines usually have at least one contraindication for a specific population for medical reasons, but if both effectiveness and coverage are high enough then herd immunity can protect these individuals. Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by passive immunity, so additional doses are recommended for some vaccines while others are not administered until after an individual has lost his or her passive immunity.

===Passive immunity===
Individual immunity can also be gained passively, when antibodies to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily immunoglobulin G antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns. Passive immunity can also be gained artificially, when a susceptible person is injected with antibodies from the serum or plasma of an immune person.

Protection generated from passive immunity is immediate, but wanes over the course of weeks to months, so any contribution to herd immunity is temporary. For diseases that are especially severe among fetuses and newborns, such as influenza and tetanus, pregnant women may be immunized in order to transfer antibodies to the child. In the same way, high-risk groups that are either more likely to experience infection, or are more likely to develop complications from infection, may receive antibody preparations to prevent these infections or to reduce the severity of symptoms.

==Cost–benefit analysis==
Herd immunity is often accounted for when conducting cost–benefit analyses of vaccination programs. It is regarded as a positive externality of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population. Therefore, herd immunity&#x27;s inclusion in cost–benefit analyses results both in more favorable cost-effectiveness or cost–benefit ratios, and an increase in the number of disease cases averted by vaccination. Study designs done to estimate herd immunity&#x27;s benefit include recording disease incidence in households with a vaccinated member, randomizing a population in a single geographic area to be vaccinated or not, and observing the incidence of disease before and after beginning a vaccination program. From these, it can be observed that disease incidence may decrease to a level beyond what can be predicted from direct protection alone, indicating that herd immunity contributed to the reduction. When serotype replacement is accounted for, it reduces the predicted benefits of vaccination.

==History==
Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased. Mass vaccination to induce herd immunity has since become common and proved successful in preventing the spread of many contagious diseases. Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.

The exact herd immunity threshold (HIT) varies depending on the basic reproduction number of the disease. An example of a disease with a high threshold was the measles, with a HIT exceeding 95%.

The term &quot;herd immunity&quot; was first used in 1894 by American veterinary scientist and then Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the US Department of Agriculture Daniel Elmer Salmon to describe the healthy vitality and resistance to disease of well-fed herds of hogs. In 1916 veterinary scientists inside the same Bureau of Animal Industry used the term to refer to the immunity arising following recovery in cattle infected with brucellosis, also known as &quot;contagious abortion.&quot; By 1923 it was being used by British bacteriologists to describe experimental epidemics with mice, experiments undertaken as part of efforts to model human epidemic disease. By the end of the 1920s the concept was used extensively - particularly among British scientists - to describe the build up of immunity in populations to diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, and influenza. Herd immunity was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the epidemiology of measles in Baltimore, and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children. In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the measles vaccine began in the 1960s. Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term &quot;herd immunity&quot;. In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculate a disease&#x27;s herd immunity threshold was developed. During the smallpox eradication campaign in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of &quot;ring vaccination&quot;, to which herd immunity is integral, began as a way to immunize every person in a &quot;ring&quot; around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.

Since the adoption of mass and ring vaccination, complexities and challenges to herd immunity have arisen. Modeling of the spread of contagious disease originally made a number of assumptions, namely that entire populations are susceptible and well-mixed, which is not the case in reality, so more precise equations have been developed. In recent decades, it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to herd immunity, either because of herd immunity acting as an evolutionary pressure or because herd immunity against one strain allowed another already-existing strain to spread. Emerging or ongoing fears and controversies about vaccination have reduced or eliminated herd immunity in certain communities, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities.

<doc id="87176" wikidata="Q187153" url="?curid=87176" title="14th arrondissement of Paris">
<text>The 14th arrondissement of Paris ( ), officially named arrondissement de l&#x27;Observatoire (; meaning &quot;arrondissement of the Observatory&quot;; named after the Paris Observatory), is one of the 20 arrondissements of Paris, the capital city of France.

It is situated on the left bank of the River Seine, containing most of the Montparnasse district. Although today Montparnasse is best known for its skyscraper, Tour Montparnasse, as well as its major railway terminus, Gare Montparnasse, both are only partially located in the neighbouring 15th arrondissement. The district has traditionally been home to many artists as well as a significant Breton community, which arrived at the beginning of the 20th century upon the creation of the Montparnasse railway terminus.

Notable sites in the 14th arrondissement include the universities of Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris and the Paris School of Economics, which is located near Parc Montsouris, Stade Charléty and the Catacombs of Paris.

Since 2014, the mayor of the 14th arrondissement is Carine Petit.

==Geography==
The land area of this arrondissement is 5.621km2 (2.17 sq. miles; 1,389 acres).

==Demography==
The 14th arrondissement attained its peak population in 1954 when it had 181,414 inhabitants. It continues to have a high density of both population and business activity with 132,844 inhabitants and 71,836 jobs as of the last census, in 1999.

===Historical population===
===Immigration===
==Economy==
Aéroports de Paris has its head office in the arrondissement. In addition &quot;Société d&#x27;exploitation de l&#x27;hebdomadaire Le Point&quot; (&quot;SEBDO Le Point&quot;), the company that operates &quot;Le Point&quot;, has its head office in the arrondissement.

SNCF, the French rail company, formerly had its head office in Montparnasse and the 14th arrondissement.

<doc id="87179" wikidata="Q242256" url="?curid=87179" title="Closed-circuit television">
<text>Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of closed-circuit television cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point, point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links. Even though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that require additional security or ongoing monitoring (videotelephony is seldom called &quot;CCTV&quot;).

The deployment of this technology has facilitated significant growth in state surveillance, a substantial rise in the methods of advanced social monitoring and control, and a host of crime prevention measures throughout the world. Though surveillance of the public using CCTV is common in many areas around the world, video surveillance has generated significant debate about balancing its use with individuals&#x27; right to privacy even when in public.

In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control room, especially if the environments observed are dangerous or inaccessible to humans. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, using digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices or internal flash for stand-alone operation.

== History ==

An early mechanical CCTV system was developed in June 1927 by Russian physicist Leon Theremin. Originally requested by CTO (the Soviet Council of Labor and Defense), the system consisted of a manually-operated scanning-transmitting camera and wireless shortwave transmitter and receiver, with a resolution of a hundred lines. Having been commandeered by Kliment Voroshilov, Theremin&#x27;s CCTV system was demonstrated to Joseph Stalin, Semyon Budyonny, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, and subsequently installed in the courtyard of the Moscow Kremlin to monitor approaching visitors.

Another early CCTV system was installed by Siemens AG at Test Stand VII in Peenemünde, Nazi Germany, in 1942, for observing the launch of V-2 rockets.

In the United States, the first commercial closed-circuit television system became available in 1949 from Remington Rand and designed by CBS Laboratories, called &quot;Vericon&quot;. Vericon was advertised as not requiring a government permit due to the system using cabled connections between camera and monitor rather than over-the-air transmission.

=== Technology ===
The earliest video surveillance systems involved constant monitoring because there was no way to record and store information. The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto a take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread.

Later, videocassette recorder technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and the use of video surveillance became more common. During the 1990s, digital multiplexing was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as time lapse and motion-only recording. This saved time and money which then led to an increase in the use of CCTV. Recently, CCTV technology has been shifting towards Internet-based products and systems, and other technological developments.

=== Application ===
Early CCTV systems were installed in central London by the Metropolitan Police between 1960 and 1965. By 1963, CCTV was being used in Munich to monitor traffic. Closed-circuit television was used as a form of pay-per-view theatre television for sports such as professional boxing and professional wrestling, and from 1964 through 1970, the Indianapolis 500 automobile race. Boxing telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, with arenas, stadiums, schools, and convention centres also being less often used venues, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live. The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was Joe Louis vs. Joe Walcott in 1948.

Closed-circuit telecasts peaked in popularity with Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 1970s, with &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot; fight drawing 50million CCTV viewers worldwide in 1974, and the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot; drawing 100million CCTV viewers worldwide in 1975. In 1985, the WrestleMania I professional wrestling show was seen by over one million viewers with this scheme. As late as 1996, the Julio César Chávez vs. Oscar De La Hoya boxing fight had 750,000 viewers. Although closed-circuit television was gradually replaced by pay-per-view home cable television in the 1980s and 1990s, it is still in use today for most awards shows and other events that are transmitted live to most venues but do not air as such on network television, and later re-edited for broadcast.

In September 1968, Olean, New York, was the first city in the United States to install CCTV video cameras along its main business street in an effort to fight crime. Marie Van Brittan Brown received a patent for the design of a CCTV-based home security system in 1969. (&quot;&quot;). Another early appearance was in 1973 in Times Square in New York City. The NYPD installed it to deter crime in the area; however, crime rates did not appear to drop much due to the cameras. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, video surveillance began to spread across the country specifically targeting public areas. It was seen as a cheaper way to deter crime compared to increasing the size of the police departments. Some businesses as well, especially those that were prone to theft, began to use video surveillance. From the mid-1990s on, police departments across the country installed an increasing number of cameras in various public spaces including housing projects, schools, and public parks. CCTV later became common in banks and stores to discourage theft by recording evidence of criminal activity. In 1997, 3,100 CCTV systems were installed in public housing and residential areas in New York City.

Experiments in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, including outdoor CCTV in Bournemouth in 1985, led to several larger trial programs later that decade. The first use by local government was in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, in 1987.

== Uses ==
=== Crime prevention ===


A 2008 report by UK Police Chiefs concluded that only 3% of crimes were solved by CCTV. In London, a Metropolitan Police report showed that in 2008 only one crime was solved per 1000 cameras. In some cases CCTV cameras have become a target of attacks themselves. A 2009 systematic review by researchers from Northeastern University and the University of Cambridge used meta-analytic techniques to pool the average effect of CCTV on crime across 41 different studies. The studies included in the meta-analysis used quasi-experimental evaluation designs that involved before-and-after measures of crime in experimental and control areas. However, researchers have argued that the British car park studies included in the meta-analysis cannot accurately control for the fact that CCTV was introduced simultaneously with a range of other security-related measures. Second, some have noted that, in many of the studies, there may be issues with selection bias since the introduction of CCTV was potentially endogenous to previous crime trends. In particular, the estimated effects may be biased if CCTV is introduced in response to crime trends.
In 2012, cities such as Manchester in the UK are using DVR-based technology to improve accessibility for crime prevention. In 2013, City of Philadelphia Auditor found that the $15 million system was operational only 32% of the time. There is anecdotal evidence that CCTV aids in detection and conviction of offenders; for example, UK police forces routinely seek CCTV recordings after crimes. Cameras have also been installed on public transport in the hope of deterring crime.

A 2017 review published in the Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies found that CCTV reduced crime by 24–28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations. Furthermore, the review indicates that CCTV is more effective in preventing property crimes than in violent crimes. However, a 2019, 40-year-long systematic review study reported that the most consistent effects of crime reduction of CCTV were in car parks.

A more open question is whether most CCTV is cost-effective. While low-quality domestic kits are cheap, the professional installation and maintenance of high definition CCTV is expensive. Gill and Spriggs did a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of CCTV in crime prevention that showed little monetary saving with the installation of CCTV as most of the crimes prevented resulted in little monetary loss. Critics however noted that benefits of non-monetary value cannot be captured in a traditional cost effectiveness analysis and were omitted from their study.

In October 2009, an &quot;Internet Eyes&quot; website was announced which would pay members of the public to view CCTV camera images from their homes and report any crimes they witnessed. The site aimed to add &quot;more eyes&quot; to cameras which might be insufficiently monitored. Civil liberties campaigners criticized the idea as &quot;a distasteful and a worrying development&quot;. Russia has also implemented a video surveillance system called &#x27;Safe City&#x27;, which has the capability to recognize facial features and moving objects, sending the data automatically to government authorities. However, the widespread tracking of individuals through video surveillance has raised significant privacy issues.

==== Forensics ====
Material collected by surveillance cameras has been used as a tool in post-event forensics to identify tactics and perpetrators of terrorist attacks. Furthermore, there are various projects—such as INDECT—that aim to detect suspicious behaviours of individuals and crowds. It has been argued that terrorists will not be deterred by cameras, that terror attacks are not really the subject of the current use of video surveillance and that terrorists might even see it as an extra channel for propaganda and publication of their acts. In Germany, calls for extended video surveillance by the country&#x27;s main political parties, SPD, CDU, and CSU have been dismissed as &quot;little more than a placebo for a subjective feeling of security&quot; by a member of the Left party.

In Singapore, since 2012, thousands of CCTV cameras have helped deter loan sharks, nab litterbugs, and stop illegal parking, according to government figures. In 2013, Oaxaca, Mexico, hired deaf police officers to lip read conversations to uncover criminal conspiracies.
=== Body-worn cameras ===

In recent years, the use of body-worn video cameras has been introduced for a number of uses. For example, as a new form of surveillance in law enforcement, there are surveillance cameras that are worn by the police officer and are usually located on a police officer&#x27;s chest or head. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), in the United States, in 2016, about 47% of the 15,328 general-purpose law enforcement agencies had acquired body-worn cameras.

=== Traffic flow monitoring ===
Many cities and motorway networks have extensive traffic-monitoring systems. Many of these cameras however, are owned by private companies and transmit data to drivers&#x27; GPS systems.

Highways England has a publicly owned CCTV network of over 3000 pan–tilt–zoom cameras covering the British motorway and trunk road network. These cameras are primarily used to monitor traffic conditions and are not used as speed cameras. With the addition of fixed cameras for the active traffic management system, the number of cameras on the Highways England&#x27;s CCTV network is likely to increase significantly over the next few years. The London congestion charge is enforced by cameras positioned at the boundaries of and inside the congestion charge zone, which automatically read the number plates of vehicles that enter the zone. If the driver does not pay the charge then a fine will be imposed. Similar systems are being developed as a means of locating cars reported stolen. Other surveillance cameras serve as traffic enforcement cameras.

In Mecca, Saudi Arabia, CCTV cameras are used for monitoring (and thus managing) the flow of crowds. In the Philippines, barangay San Antonio used CCTV cameras and artificial intelligence software to detect the formation of crowds during an outbreak of a disease. Security personnel were sent whenever a crowd formed at a particular location in the city.

=== Use in homes and buildings ===

==== In schools ====
In the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools to prevent bullying, vandalism, monitoring visitors, and maintaining a record of evidence of a crime. There are some restrictions: cameras are not typically installed in areas where there is a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;, such as bathrooms, gym locker areas, and private offices. Cameras are generally acceptable in parking lots, cafeterias, and supply rooms. Though some teachers object to the installation of cameras. A study of high school students in Israeli schools shows that students&#x27; views on CCTV used in school are based on how they think of their teachers, school, and authorities. It also stated that most students do not want CCTV installed inside a classroom.

==== In private and public places ====
Many homeowners choose to install CCTV systems either inside or outside their own homes, sometimes both. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps with internet coverage. Some systems also provide motion detection, so when movement is detected, an alert can be sent to a phone.

On a driver-only operated train, CCTV cameras may allow the driver to confirm that people are clear of doors before closing them and starting the train. A trial by RET in 2011 with facial recognition cameras mounted on trams made sure that people who were banned from them did not sneak on anyway. CCTV has also been frequently operated in many department stores and shopping malls to mitigate concerns of potential theft. In some countries, malls must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior (MOI) or Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO) before installing CCTVs. Some organizations also use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers in a workplace.Many sporting events in the United States use CCTV inside the venue, either to display on the stadium or arena&#x27;s scoreboard or in the concourse or restroom areas to allow people to view action outside the seating bowl. The cameras send the feed to a central control centre where a producer selects feeds to send to the television monitors that people can view. In a trial with CCTV cameras, football club fans no longer needed to identify themselves manually, but could pass freely after being authorized by the facial recognition system.

=== Criminal use ===
Criminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an ATM can capture people&#x27;s PINs as they are entered without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data received by people who have no legal right to receive it.

== Prevalence ==
=== In Asia ===
About 65% of CCTV cameras in the world are installed in Asia. In Asia, different human activities attracted the use of surveillance camera systems and services, including but not limited to business and related industries, transportation, sports, and care for the environment.

In 2018, China was reported to have over 170 million CCTV cameras. In 2023, China was estimated to have a huge surveillance network of around 540–626 million surveillance cameras, though numbers differ significantly between sources. Beijing, China&#x27;s capital city, has the most cameras for a city overall, with a total of 1.15 million installed. The cameras are used to record details such as gender, age, and ethnicity. Cameras have been used in a southern Chinese city to issue tickets to people for infractions. In India, the cities of Hyderabad and Delhi, the capital, have around 900,000 and 450,000 cameras, respectively. The city of Chennai has the highest density per area of CCTV cameras worldwide, with 657 cameras per square kilometer in 2020 (from 280,000 CCTVs). China and India have some of the highest-density and the most amount of CCTVs in cities.

South Korea&#x27;s military has removed over 1,300 surveillance Chinese cameras from its bases for security reasons. In Hong Kong, the police have stated that they are planning to install up to 7,000 surveillance cameras across Hong Kong in roughly three years time, up from the estimated 600 installed cameras in 2024; this amounts to roughly 2,000 planned cameras every year starting from 2025. Earlier, in June 2024, the cameras have also been vaguely planned to be integrated with facial recognition artificial intelligence. The plan has been criticized for the potential for the country to become similar to the &quot;intense surveillance of mainland China&quot;. In Japan, an estimation by Nikkei Business estimated that the total number of security cameras in Japan is approximately 5 million in 2018. In Singapore, it was estimated that the total number of CCTVs was around 90,000 in 2021.

===In the Americas===

In 2009, there were an estimated 15,000 CCTV systems in Chicago, many linked to an integrated camera network. New York City&#x27;s Domain Awareness System has 6,000 video surveillance cameras linked together, there are over 4,000 cameras on the subway system (although nearly half of them do not work), and two-thirds of large apartment and commercial buildings use video surveillance cameras. In Washington, D.C., there are more than 30,000 surveillance cameras in schools, and the Metro has nearly 6,000 cameras in use across the system.

There were an estimated 30 million surveillance cameras in the United States in 2011. Video surveillance has been common in the United States since the 1990s; for example, one manufacturer reported net earnings of $120 million in 1995. With lower cost and easier installation, sales of home security cameras increased in the early 21st century. Following the September 11 attacks, the use of video surveillance in public places became more common to deter future terrorist attacks. Under the Homeland Security Grant Program, government grants are available for cities to install surveillance camera networks. In 2018, there are approximately 70 million surveillance cameras in the United States.

In Canada, Project SCRAM is a policing effort by the Canadian policing service Halton Regional Police Service to register and help consumers understand privacy and safety issues related to the installations of home security systems. The project service has not been extended to commercial businesses.

In Latin America, the CCTV market is growing rapidly with the increase of property crime. In Brazil, CCTV usage is only permitted in public areas, though individuals must be informed about the presence of the camera according to the Brazilian LGPD (which broadly aligns with the EU&#x27;s GDPR), the Brazilian Civil Code, and the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards. However, starting in 2023, in Brazil, the Smart Sampa project, a project that plans to deploy 20,000 facial recognition cameras by 2024, has been criticized for its potential to be &quot;biased against Black individuals&quot; and overall risks of data privacy.

=== In Russia ===

In 2017, in Russia, the Moscow network included 160,000 CCTV cameras and 95 percent of residential buildings; over 3,500 Russian cameras were connected to the General Centre for Data Storage and Processing. Video recordings are used to solve 70 percent of offenses and crimes. In 2024, there are over 1 million video surveillance cameras in Russia. About 230,000 are in use in Moscow alone. According to data from the Russian Minister for Digital Development, Maksut Shadayev, one in three of all CCTVs in Russia were connected to a facial recognition system. A leaked document revealed that the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, called on the Russian security services to fund &quot;a massive AI-based surveillance apparatus&quot;. The spending of over was planned for the system in 2024–2026.

=== In Europe ===

==== In the United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, the vast majority of CCTV cameras are operated not by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 requests, the total number of local government-operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.

An article published in &quot;CCTV Image&quot; magazine estimated the number of private and local government-operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85 million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.

The Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of &quot;UrbanEye&quot; published in 2002. Based on a small sample in Putney High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in Greater London to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4.2 million. According to their estimate, the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed, it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government-operated cameras in the City of London, which was about 650 in 2011.

The &quot;CCTV User Group&quot; estimated that there were around 1.5 million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK. Research conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities identified that there are over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland. The UK has often been cited as a country that has one of the most CCTV cameras in Europe.

=== In Africa ===
In South Africa, due to the high crime rate, CCTV surveillance is widely prevalent. The first IP camera was released in 1996 by Axis Communications, but IP cameras did not arrive in South Africa until 2008. To regulate the number of suppliers in 2001, the Private Security Industry Regulation Act was passed requiring all security companies to be registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA). In Egypt, the capital city of Cairo has approximately 47,000 cameras, while the New Administrative Capital has more than 6,000 surveillance cameras in 2023. In South Sudan, the Ministry of Interior has reinstated the operation of CCTV surveillance cameras in Juba after the cameras have been inactive for over four years; South Sudan also launched a drone security system in 2024 in Juba.

== Privacy ==

Proponents of CCTV cameras argue that cameras are effective at deterring and solving crime, and that appropriate regulation and legal restrictions on surveillance of &quot;public&quot; spaces can provide sufficient protections so that an individual&#x27;s right to privacy can reasonably be weighed against the benefits of surveillance. However, anti-surveillance activists have held that there is a right to privacy in public areas, that the development of CCTV in public areas, linked to databases of people&#x27;s pictures and identity, presents a breach of civil liberties and the loss of anonymity in public places.

Furthermore, some scholars have argued that situations wherein a person&#x27;s rights can be justifiably compromised are so rare as to not sufficiently warrant the frequent compromising of public privacy rights that occurs in regions with widespread CCTV surveillance. For example, in her book &quot;Setting the Watch: Privacy and the Ethics of CCTV Surveillance&quot;, Beatrice von Silva-Tarouca Larsen argues that CCTV surveillance is ethically permissible only in &quot;certain restrictively defined situations&quot;, such as when a specific location has a &quot;comprehensively documented and significant criminal threat&quot;.

=== Law by countries ===
In the United States, the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy although the Supreme Court has said several of the amendments to the Constitution implicitly grant this right. Access to video surveillance recordings may require a judge&#x27;s writ, which is readily available. However, there is little legislation and regulation specific to video surveillance. In Canada, the use of video surveillance has grown very rapidly. In Ontario, both the &quot;municipal&quot; and &quot;provincial&quot; versions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act outline guidelines that control how images and information can be gathered by this method and or released.

All countries in the European Union are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects individual rights, including the right to privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) required that the footage should only be retained for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. In Sweden, the use of CCTV in public spaces is regulated both nationally and via GDPR. In an opinion poll commissioned by Lund University in August 2017, the general public of Sweden was asked to choose one measure that would ensure their need for privacy when subject to CCTV operation in public spaces: 43% favored regulation in the form of clear routines for managing, storing, and distributing image material generated from surveillance cameras, 39% favored regulation in the form of clear signage informing that camera surveillance in public spaces is present, 10% favored regulation in the form of having restrictive policies for issuing permits for surveillance cameras in public spaces, 6% were unsure, and 2% favored regulation in the form of having permits restricting the use of surveillance cameras during certain times.

In the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 1998 imposes legal restrictions on the uses of CCTV recordings and mandates the registration of CCTV systems with the Data Protection Agency. In 2004, the successor to the Data Protection Agency, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, clarified that this required registration of all CCTV systems with the Commissioner and prompt deletion of archived recordings. However, subsequent case law (Durant vs. FSA) limited the scope of the protection provided by this law, and not all CCTV systems are currently regulated.

A 2007 report by the UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office highlighted the need for the public to be made more aware of the growing use of surveillance and the potential impact on civil liberties. In the same year, a campaign group claimed that the majority of CCTV cameras in the UK are operated illegally or are in breach of privacy guidelines. In response, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office rebutted the claim and added that any reported abuses of the Data Protection Act are swiftly investigated. Even if there are some concerns arising from the use of CCTV such as involving privacy, more commercial establishments are still installing CCTV systems in the UK. In 2012, the UK government enacted the Protection of Freedoms Act which includes several provisions related to controlling the storage and use of information about individuals. Under this Act, the Home Office published a code of practice in 2013 for the use of surveillance cameras by government and local authorities. The code wrote that &quot;surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to policing by consent.&quot;

In the Philippines, the main laws governing CCTV usage are Data Privacy Act of 2012 and the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) is the primary law that governs data privacy in the Philippines. The Act mandates that the privacy of individuals must be respected and protected. The law applies to CCTV cameras as they collect and process personal data. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) includes provisions that apply to CCTV usage. Under the Act, the unauthorized access to, interception of, or interference with data is a criminal offense. This means that unauthorized access to CCTV footage could potentially be considered a cybercrime.

== Technological developments ==
=== Computer-controlled identification ===
Computer-controlled cameras can identify, track, and categorize objects in their field of view. Video content analysis, also referred to as video analytics, is the capability of automatically analyzing video to detect and determine temporal events not based on a single image but rather on object classification. Advanced VCA applications can measure object speed. Some video analytics applications can be used to apply rules to designated areas. These rules can relate to access control. For example, they can describe which objects can enter into a specific area. There are different approaches to implementing VCA technology. Data may be processed on the camera itself (edge processing) or by a centralized server. Artificial intelligence-powered CCTV cameras have also been further tested to detect congestion, be used as a facial recognition system, and predict signs of criminal activities.

=== Compression ===
There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, and image size, and is affected by the retention period of the videos or images. DVRs store images in a variety of proprietary file formats. CCTV security cameras can either store the images on a local hard disk drive, an SD card, or in the cloud. Recordings may be retained for a preset amount of time and then automatically archived, overwritten, or deleted, the period being determined by the organisation that generated them.

=== IP cameras ===
A growing branch in CCTV is &quot;internet protocol&quot; cameras (IP cameras). It is estimated that 2014 was the first year that IP cameras outsold analog cameras. IP cameras use the Internet Protocol (IP) used by most local area networks (LANs) to transmit video across data networks in digital form. IP can optionally be transmitted across the public internet, allowing users to view their cameras remotely on a computer or phone via an internet connection. IP cameras are considered part of the Internet of things (IoT) and have many of the same benefits and security risks as other IP-enabled devices. Smart doorbells are one example of a type of CCTV that uses IP to allow it to send alerts.

Main types of IP cameras include fixed cameras, pan–tilt–zoom (PTZ) cameras, and multi-sensor cameras. Fixed cameras&#x27; resolution typically does not exceed 20 megapixels. The main feature of a PTZ is its remote directional and optical zoom capability. With multi-sensor cameras, wider areas can be monitored. Industrial video surveillance systems use network video recorders to support IP cameras. These devices are responsible for the recording, storage, video stream processing, and alarm management. Since 2008, IP video surveillance manufacturers can use a standardized network interface (ONVIF) to support compatibility between systems. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN.

=== Networking CCTV cameras ===
The city of Chicago operates a networked video surveillance system which combines CCTV video feeds of government agencies with those of the private sector, installed in city buses, businesses, public schools, subway stations, housing projects, etc. Even homeowners are able to contribute footage. It is estimated to incorporate the video feeds of a total of 15,000 cameras. The system is used by Chicago&#x27;s Office of Emergency Management in case of an emergency call: it detects the caller&#x27;s location and instantly displays the real-time video feed of the nearest security camera to the operator, not requiring any user intervention. While the system is far too vast to allow complete real-time monitoring, it stores the video data for use as evidence in criminal cases.

=== Wireless security cameras ===

Many consumers are turning to wireless security cameras for home surveillance. Wireless cameras do not require a video cable for video/audio transmission, simply a cable for power. Wireless cameras are also easy and inexpensive to install. Previous generations of wireless security cameras relied on analogue technology; modern wireless cameras use digital technology with usually more secure and interference-free signals. Wireless mesh networks have been used for connection with the other radios in the same group. There are also cameras using solar power. Wireless IP cameras can become a client on the WLAN, and they can be configured with encryption and authentication protocols with a connection to an access point.

=== Talking CCTV ===

In Wiltshire, United Kingdom, in 2003, a pilot scheme for what is now known as &quot;Talking CCTV&quot; was put into action, allowing operators of CCTV cameras to communicate through the camera via a speaker when it is needed. In 2005, Ray Mallon, the mayor and former senior police officer of Middlesbrough, implemented &quot;Talking CCTV&quot; in his area. Other towns have had such cameras installed. In 2007, several of the devices were installed in Bridlington town centre, East Riding of Yorkshire.

== Countermeasures ==
In December 2016, a form of anti-CCTV and facial recognition sunglasses called &quot;reflectacles&quot; were invented by a craftsman based in Chicago named Scott Urban. They reflect infrared and, optionally, visible light which makes the user&#x27;s face a white blur to cameras. The project passed its funding goal of $28,000, and &quot;reflectacles&quot; became commercially available in June 2017.

<text>Liberty X (originally called Liberty) are a British Girl group consisting of Michelle Heaton, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young.

The group was formed by the five finalists of the 2001 ITV talent show &quot;Popstars&quot; who failed to make it into the winning group Hear&#x27;Say. The group released their debut album, &quot;Thinking It Over&quot;, on 27 May 2002 which featured their biggest single &quot;Just a Little&quot;, which gave them international success. They released their second studio album &quot;Being Somebody&quot; a year later on 3 November 2003, although not matching the success of their debut. Following disappointing sales, the group were dropped and later signed with Virgin, released a final studio album &quot;X&quot; on 10 October 2005 and disbanded in 2007. Liberty X went on to achieve ten consecutive UK Top 20 singles, and various charting singles worldwide, leading to greater commercial success than Hear&#x27;Say. In 2013 the original line up toured until 2014.

==History==

===2000–2001: &quot;Popstars&quot;, formation and name change===
While the five winning contestants of &quot;Popstars&quot; formed Hear&#x27;Say, the five runner-up contestants—Michelle Heaton, Tony Lundon, Kevin Simm, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young—formed the group Liberty. The name Liberty was chosen to reflect the freedom the members experienced following their participation in &quot;Popstars&quot;. Amidst pejorative media commentary (including the term &quot;Flopstars&quot;), the act signed a multi-million-pound record contract with Richard Branson&#x27;s independent record label, V2 Records.

Shortly after forming, Liberty received a legal challenge in the UK High Court from a funk R&amp;B band, also called &quot;Liberty&quot;, who achieved success in the 1990s, including being awarded Capital Radio Band of the Year, playing Wembley Arena, European tours and the release of albums in the US, Europe and UK. The original Liberty claimed that the newly formed Liberty was taking advantage of the goodwill that had been created by the former&#x27;s success (known in English law as the &quot;tort of passing off&quot;). The final judgment was in favour of the funk R&amp;B band and the ex-&quot;Popstars&quot; then asked readers of UK tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; to suggest a new name. The winning name was &quot;X Liberty&quot;, but the group used the entry as the basis for the official title, Liberty X.

===2001–2002: &quot;Thinking It Over&quot; and touring===
On 24 September 2001, whilst the group were known as Liberty, they released their debut single, &quot;Thinking It Over&quot;. It was an instant hit, reaching number five on the UK Singles Chart; the single&#x27;s physical release featured remixes by the Wideboys and Boy George. The follow-up single, &quot;Doin&#x27; It&quot;, released on 3 December 2001, peaked at number fourteen. Following a five-month gap, in which the band were involved with the High Court dispute regarding their original name, their third single, &quot;Just a Little&quot;, was released. That song reached number one in the UK and became the ninth best-selling single of 2002, as well as becoming a top ten hit in several other countries. It was also the fifth most played song on the radio of the 2000s.

&quot;Just a Little&quot; preceded the release of Liberty X&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Thinking It Over&quot; (originally called &quot;To Those Who Wait&quot;). The album reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, eventually selling over one million copies worldwide. Two more hit singles were released from the album, the first being a cover of the 1989 track by electro funk group Mantronix, &quot;Got To Have Your Love&quot;; Mantronix&#x27;s founding member, Kurtis Mantronik, remixed the Liberty X version for the single release, which peaked at number two in the UK. The final single was &quot;Holding on for You&quot;, released in December 2002. The single peaked at number five. During 2002, the group headlined their first arena tour.

===2003–2005: &quot;Being Somebody&quot; and record label change===
Following a short break, the group released &quot;Being Nobody&quot;, a mash-up of Chaka Khan&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; and The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Being Boiled&quot;. The single was produced by Richard X and released under the billing of Richard X vs Liberty X, featured on Richard X&#x27;s album &quot;Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1&quot;. &quot;Being Nobody&quot; reached number three on the UK singles chart. Proceeding their second album, &quot;Being Somebody&quot;, the group released &quot;Jumpin&quot;, which peaked at number six. &quot;Being Somebody&quot; was released in November 2003, debuting at number twelve on the UK albums chart, but sold around 200,000 copies, significantly less than sales of their debut. The group released the album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Everybody Cries&quot;, in January 2004. The music video featured the group walking along disused railway lines, for which they were criticised by safety organisations. The single underperformed, reaching number thirteen.

The group took a hiatus following record-label issues, and each member decided to work on different individual projects. Kevin Simm appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Games&quot;, competing in a series of sporting events (in which he placed second overall, behind Philip Olivier). Michelle Heaton appeared on ITV&#x27;s ill-fated &quot;Celebrity Wrestling&quot;. Jessica Taylor appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Ice Dancing&quot;. Tony Lundon and Kelli Young took the time to work on new tracks for the band&#x27;s third album, whilst producing and writing for other artists. During this period, &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper reported that the group were to re-release &quot;Being Somebody&quot; with a cover of the 1990 hit &quot;Back to Life&quot;, but this never materialised. They also released a cover version of the Kool &amp; The Gang song &quot;Fresh&quot; which was released in a selection of European countries, but not the UK. It peaked at number 35 in France.

===2005–2007: &quot;X&quot; and split===
In mid-2005, it was announced that Liberty X had left V2 Records and signed to independent label Unique Corp Records. Their third album, &quot;X&quot;, was released in October 2005. The first single, &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot; (featuring Rev Run of Run–D.M.C., who also co-wrote the track), had been recorded when they were signed to V2, but they re-recorded it because V2 did not consider the song suitable as a Liberty X single. It was released in September 2005 and was well-received, achieving a large amount of television and radio airplay; it entered the UK charts at number five to become their first top ten hit in two years. &quot;X&quot;, however, peaked at number 27, failing to match the success of &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot;, and sold just 10,000 copies in the UK.

In late October, the group announced they had been asked to record the official 2005 Children in Need single, so they teamed up with producer Rod Gammons to record two tracks for double A-side release: &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (a cover of the Shalamar song) and &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; (a (Chic cover). The group performed both singles live on the night, 18 November 2005. The double A-side single entered at number six in the UK; it also peaked at number 16 in France, becoming their biggest hit there since &quot;Just a Little&quot;.

In May 2006, the band were featured in the line up of Aberystwyth University May ball, alongside Chesney Hawkes and BodyRockers. Their set was cut short when a smoke bomb was set off during the first two minutes, filling the room with smoke. Firefighters gave the all-clear after 50 minutes, but Liberty X failed to reappear. Students were told the band were not returning to finish their set, met by jeers from the crowd, who had paid £37 each for the evening.

Liberty X returned in June 2006 with the single &quot;X&quot;, a remixed version of the &quot;X&quot; album track. It peaked at number 47. The re-release of the album, which contains &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and the new version of &quot;X&quot;, failed to attract significant consumer interest. &quot;X&quot; also reached just number 89 in France. Despite rumours of splitting, Liberty X announced in 2006 that they were still together but concentrating on solo projects. Michelle Heaton wrote on the group&#x27;s official site that they would be releasing a new single in the new year (2007), a song from a forthcoming film, but this did not happen. Heaton married her partner of four years, Andy Scott-Lee, Taylor got engaged to cricket star Kevin Pietersen, Simm appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Games: Champion of Champions&quot; (competing for his team), and Lundon wrote tracks for what would have been the band&#x27;s fourth album. On 20 May 2007, Liberty X posted a message on their website that said they would no longer record together after the tour:

The group performed their last gig on 2 September 2007, alongside Liz McClarnon, Lisa Scott-Lee and Stonefoxx at the Wiltshire Crime Stoppers charity event held in the grounds of Bowood House, near Chippenham in Wiltshire. The band reunited in August 2008 to perform at Belfast&#x27;s gay pride celebrations, the first time they had been on stage together in over a year.

===2012–2014: Full members reunion===
On 18 October 2012, it was announced that Liberty X, along with five other pop groups of their time – B*Witched, Honeyz, 911, Five and Atomic Kitten – would reunite for an ITV2 series called &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, in which they would reveal about their individual stories about their life in the band before reforming for a gig at the Hammersmith Apollo, singing their greatest hits. The show, which aired from 31 January to 28 March 2013, followed the groups rehearsing for two weeks ahead of one major comeback performance at the London Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February.
Tickets for the Hammersmith Apollo reunion gig went on sale shortly after the premiere of the first episode of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; and sold out in less than five minutes. Due to this, it was confirmed that a full UK tour was in the works, later confirmed again by Heaton on her Twitter account. The bands were originally only supposed to perform a one-off concert at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013, but when the entire show sold out in under five minutes shortly after the premiere of the first episode on 31 January 2013, rumours circulated that producers of the show were planning to tour the concert around the UK. On 11 February, it was confirmed that due to high demands for tickets and the popularity of the show, an arena tour around the UK would be taking place from 3–12 May 2013. On 27 March 2013 it was announced that the bands would perform a mini Christmas tour in December 2013.

On 29 March 2013, Heaton confirmed that Liberty X would yet again disband following the concerts, saying: &quot;We talked about it, and we thought we&#x27;ve got so many children between us and quite a few things individually going on that we didn&#x27;t want the pressure to be successful again. We just wanted to have fun. I know some of the other bands are planning to release new material but Liberty X, we are not planning to do that. We are just enjoying it for what it is. We&#x27;re going to enjoy the gigs, all the performing and have fun and not take it too seriously – and know at the end, we go back to being mums and dads to our children. That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s different.&quot; Whilst on &quot;Lorraine&quot; on 12 September, however, Heaton said, &quot;When we filmed [&quot;The Big Reunion: On Tour&quot;] in May, we said &#x27;no&#x27; and we said we weren&#x27;t going to do anything, but because we love it so much, I&#x27;d like to say &#x27;never say never&#x27;. So maybe ask me again after Christmas.&quot; The group performed their final gig together on 15 December 2013.

In 2014, Liberty X signed to 365 Artists Management and toured at the Summer Tour. In 2016, Simm auditioned for the fifth series of &quot;The Voice UK&quot;, making it clear that he left Liberty X as he felt they were officially over since 2014. He was mentored by coach Ricky Wilson and subsequently won the competition.

===2017–present: Girls reunion===
In 2017, Heaton, Taylor and Young reformed Liberty X as a three-piece girl group and have continued touring at music festivals and Pride events since. On 4 June 2023, the group performed a headline show at &#x27;Mighty Hoopla&#x27;. In 2024, the group headlined at the Spalding Festival in Lincolnshire, between the 24 and 26 May.

<doc id="87184" wikidata="Q543609" url="?curid=87184" title="1992 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The 1992 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 9 April 1992, to elect 651 members to the House of Commons. The governing Conservative Party led by Prime Minister John Major won a fourth consecutive election victory, with a majority of 21. This would be the last time that the Conservatives would win an overall majority at a general election until 2015 and the last general election to be held on a day which did not coincide with any local elections until 2017. This election result took many by surprise, as opinion polling leading up to the election day had shown a narrow but consistent lead for the Labour Party under leader Neil Kinnock during a period of recession and declining living standards.

John Major had won the leadership election in November 1990 following the resignation of Margaret Thatcher. During his first term leading up to the 1992 election he oversaw the British involvement in the Gulf War, introduced legislation to replace the unpopular Community Charge with Council Tax, and signed the Maastricht Treaty. Britain was sliding into its second recession in a decade at the time of Major&#x27;s appointment.

Opinion polls in the run-up to the election had suggested that it would end in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority. The fact that it produced a Conservative majority meant that it was one of the most dramatic and memorable elections in the UK since the end of the Second World War. The Conservative Party received what remains the largest number of votes at a United Kingdom general election in British history, breaking the previous record set by the Labour Party in 1951. 

Former Conservative leader and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former Labour Party leader Michael Foot, former SDP leader David Owen, three former Chancellors of the Exchequer, Denis Healey, Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, former Home Secretary Merlyn Rees, Francis Maude, Norman Tebbit, Rosie Barnes, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams and Speaker of the House of Commons Bernard Weatherill left the House of Commons after this election, though Maude and Adams returned at the next election. Future Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith was elected to parliament in this election.

==Overview==
The Conservatives had been re-elected in a landslide at the 1987 general election under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, who had led the party back into power in 1979 and won a landslide majority in 1983, but her popularity and that of her government sharply declined due to internal divisions in the party and the unpopular Community Charge (also known as the &#x27;poll tax&#x27;), as well as the fact that Britain was sliding into recession in the run-up to her resignation in November 1990.

Labour began to lead the Conservatives in the opinion polls by as much as 20 percentage points. Thatcher resigned following the party leadership ballot in November 1990, initiated by Michael Heseltine, and was replaced by her Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. This was well received by the public; Labour lost some momentum as it reduced the impact of their calls for &quot;Time for a Change&quot;.

On 16 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began the Gulf War, the Major ministry&#x27;s first foreign affairs crisis. The quick and successful outcome on the conflict led to a boost in opinion polls for Major, in spite of the deepening recession and rising unemployment. Another boost in the polls for Major was his announcement that the unpopular community charge (poll tax) would be replaced with the Council Tax. The Labour opposition made repeated calls for a general election to be held during 1991, but Major resisted these calls.

As 1992 dawned, the recession had still not ended, unemployment now topped 2.5 million and the election loomed, with most opinion polls suggested that the election would produce a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, although the lead in the polls had shifted between Tory and Labour on several occasions since November 1990.

Parliament was due to expire no later than 16 June 1992. Major called the election on 11 March, as was widely expected, the day after Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont had delivered the Budget. The Conservatives maintained strong support in many newspapers, especially &quot;The Sun&quot;, which ran a series of anti-Labour articles that culminated on election day with a front-page headline which urged &quot;the last person to leave Britain&quot; to &quot;turn out the lights&quot; if Labour won the election.

==Campaign==
The 50th Parliament of the United Kingdom sat for the last time on Monday 16 March, being dissolved on the same day.

Under the leadership of Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party had undergone further developments and alterations since its 1987 general election defeat. Labour entered the campaign confident, with most opinion polls showing a slight Labour lead that if maintained suggested a hung parliament, with no single party having an overall majority.

The parties campaigned on the familiar grounds of taxation and health care. Major became known for delivering his speeches while standing on an upturned soapbox during public meetings. Immigration was also an issue, with Home Secretary Kenneth Baker making a controversial speech stating that, under Labour, the floodgates would be opened for immigrants from developing countries. Some speculated that this was a bid by the Conservatives to shore up its support amongst its white working-class supporters. The Conservatives also pounded the Labour Party over the issue of taxation, producing a memorable poster entitled &quot;Labour&#x27;s Double-Whammy&quot;, showing a boxer wearing gloves marked &quot;tax rises&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot;.

An early setback for Labour came in the form of the &quot;War of Jennifer&#x27;s Ear&quot; controversy, which questioned the truthfulness of a Labour party election broadcast concerning National Health Service (NHS) waiting lists.

Labour seemingly recovered from the NHS controversy, and opinion polls on 1 April (dubbed &quot;Red Wednesday&quot;) showed a clear Labour lead. But the lead fell considerably in the following day&#x27;s polls. Observers blamed the decline on the Labour Party&#x27;s triumphalist &quot;Sheffield Rally&quot;, an enthusiastic American-style political convention at the Sheffield Arena, where Neil Kinnock famously cried out &quot;We&#x27;re all right!&quot; three times. However, some analysts and participants in the campaign believed it actually had little effect, with the event only receiving widespread attention after the election.

This was the first general election for the newly formed Liberal Democrats, a party formed by the formal merger of the SDP–Liberal Alliance following the 1987 general election. Its formation had not been without its problems, but under the strong leadership of Paddy Ashdown, who proved to be a likeable and candid figure, the party went into the election ready to win votes and seats. They focused on education throughout the campaign, as well as a promise on reforming the voting system.

The weather was largely dull for most of the campaign, but sunny conditions on 9 April may have been a factor in the high turnout.

==Minor parties==
In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) hoped for a major electoral breakthrough in 1992 and had run a hard independence campaign with &quot;Free by &#x27;93&quot; as their slogan, urging voters to back a party which would deliver Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. Although the party increased its total vote by 50% compared to 1987, they only held onto the three seats they had won at the previous election. They lost Glasgow Govan, which their deputy leader Jim Sillars had taken from Labour in a by-election in 1988. Sillars quit active politics after the general election with a parting shot at the Scottish electorate as being &quot;ninety-minute patriots&quot;, referring to their support of the Scotland football team only during match time.

The election also saw a small change in Northern Ireland: the Conservatives organised and stood candidates in the constituent country for the first time since the Ulster Unionist Party had broken with them in 1972 over the Sunningdale Agreement. Although they won no seats, their best result was Laurence Kennedy achieving over 14,000 votes to run second to James Kilfedder in North Down.

==Retirees==

Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher stepped down at the general election, as did former cabinet minister Norman Tebbit, Labour veteran Denis Healey, former Conservative chancellor Nigel Lawson, Geoffrey Howe, former Labour leader Michael Foot, former SDP leader David Owen, Merlyn Rees, then-Speaker Bernard Weatherill, former Conservative Party chairman Cecil Parkinson, John Wakeham, Nicholas Ridley and Peter Morrison. Alan Clark also retired from Parliament, though he returned in 1997 as MP for Kensington and Chelsea, only to die two years later.

==Endorsements==
The following newspapers endorsed political parties running in the election in the following ways:
In a move later described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as appalling to its City readership, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; endorsed the Labour Party in this general election.

==Opinion polling==


Almost every poll leading up to polling day predicted either a hung parliament with Labour the largest party, or a small Labour majority of around 19 to 23. Polls on the last few days before the country voted predicted a very slim Labour majority. Of the 50 opinion polls published during the election campaign period, 38 suggested Labour had a narrow but clear lead. After the polls closed, the BBC and ITV exit polls still predicted that there would be a hung parliament and &quot;that the Conservatives would only just get more seats than Labour&quot;.

With opinion polls at the end of the campaign showing Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck, the actual election result was a surprise to many in the media and in polling organisations. The apparent failure of the opinion polls to come close to predicting the actual result led to an inquiry by the &quot;Market Research Society&quot;, and would eventually result in the creation of the British Polling Council a decade later. Following the election, most opinion polling companies changed their methodology in the belief that a &#x27;Shy Tory factor&#x27; affected the polling.

==Results==
The election turnout of 77.67% was the highest in 18 years. There was an overall Labour swing of 2.2%, which widened the gap between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Although the percentage of Conservative votes was only 0.3% down on 1987, the Conservative overall majority in the House of Commons was reduced from 102 to 21. This number was reduced progressively during the course of Major&#x27;s term in office due to defections of MPs to other parties, by-election defeats, and for a time in 1994–95 the suspension of the Conservative whip for some MPs who voted against the government on its European policyby 1996, the Conservative majority had been reduced to just 1 seat, and they were in a minority going into 1997 until the 1997 general election. The Conservatives in 1992 received 14,093,007 votes, the highest total of votes for any political party in any UK general election, beating the previous largest total vote of 13.98 million achieved by Labour in 1951 (although this was from a smaller electorate and represented a higher vote share). Nine government ministers lost their seats in 1992, including party chairman Chris Patten.

&quot;The Sun&quot;″s analysis of the election results was headlined &quot;It&#x27;s The Sun Wot Won It&quot;, though in his testimony to the April 2012 Leveson Inquiry, Rupert Murdoch claimed that the &quot;infamous&quot; headline was &quot;both tasteless and wrong&quot;. Tony Blair also accepted this theory of Labour&#x27;s defeat and put considerable effort into securing &quot;The Sun&quot;″s support for New Labour, both as Leader of the Opposition before the 1997 general election and as Prime Minister afterwards.

Steve Richards notes that one theory for Labour&#x27;s defeat relates to Kinnock seeming triumphalist, &quot;overconfident and cocky&quot; at a major Labour Party election rally in Sheffield. At the time of the event polls suggested Labour was well ahead of the Conservatives. Richards argues the rally &quot;acquired a mythological status as fatal event&quot; after Labour&#x27;s defeat, but considers this theory to be &quot;a red herring&quot;. He notes that prior to the result of the election becoming known, &quot;there was no suggestion that Kinnock had made a terrible blunder&quot; at the event. Indeed, Richards notes that the BBC&#x27;s political editor John Cole had indicated he had been impressed in his live reporting of the rally which Cole compared with similar events held by President Kennedy. Richards concluded that the party would have lost the election even if there had been no Sheffield Rally.

This election continued the Conservatives&#x27; decline in Northern England, with Labour regaining many seats they had not held since 1979. The Conservatives also began to lose support in the Midlands, but achieved a slight increase in their vote in Scotland, where they had a net gain of one seat. Labour and Plaid Cymru strengthened in Wales, with Conservative support declining. However, in the South East, South West, London and Eastern England the Conservative vote held up, leading to few losses there: many considered Basildon to be indicative of a nouveau riche working-class element, referred to as Essex man, voting strongly Conservative. This election is the most recent in which the Conservatives won more seats than Labour in Greater London, at 48 to 35; in the 1997 election, the Conservatives would win only 11.

For the Liberal Democrats their first election campaign was a reasonable success; the party had worked itself up from a &quot;low base&quot; during its troubled creation and come out relatively unscathed.

It was Labour&#x27;s second general election defeat under leader Neil Kinnock and deputy leader Roy Hattersley. Both resigned soon after the election, and were succeeded by John Smith and Margaret Beckett respectively.

Sitting MPs Dave Nellist, Terry Fields, Ron Brown, John Hughes and Syd Bidwell, who had been expelled or deselected by the Labour Party and stood as independents, were all defeated, although in Nellist&#x27;s case only very narrowly. Tommy Sheridan, fighting the election from prison, polled 19% in Glasgow Pollok.

==Television coverage==

The BBC ran coverage from 21:55 till 06:00, and from 09:30 till 16:00 on Friday 10 April. Unlike most prior British elections, the BBC&#x27;s coverage started five minutes before the polls closed and the result of the exit poll was announced live, accompanied by footage of Big Ben striking, at 10pm. This method of revealing the exit poll has been repeated in all subsequent BBC election night broadcasts.

Coverage was, according to the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, supposed to end at 04:00 on Friday morning, but was extended.

The BBC began construction of the Election 92 studio in October 1990, completing it in February 1991, due to speculation that an early election may be called in 1991. Rehearsals were held in the event of a Conservative and Labour victory.

Although the election was not part of the storyline, there was much background chanting and campaigning in the BBC television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

On ITV, ITN produced their election night coverage from their studios in London, with Jon Snow anchoring the coverage from 22:00 until 06:00. They continued their daytime coverage on Friday 10 April from 09:25 until 15:25. Breakfast coverage of the election results were provided by TV-am, the ITV breakfast franchise, from 06:00 until 09:25, who were producing their third and final general election special.

<doc id="87187" wikidata="Q1518827" url="?curid=87187" title="European Court of Justice">
<text>The European Court of Justice (ECJ), formally just the Court of Justice (), is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state – currently – although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015.

The ECJ is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law, but not national law. It is not possible to appeal against the decisions of national courts in the ECJ, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the ECJ. However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation to the facts of any given case, although only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the ECJ the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole.

The court also acts as an administrative and constitutional court between the other EU institutions and the Member States and can annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

==History==
The court was established in 1952, by the Treaty of Paris (1951) as part of the European Coal and Steel Community. It was established with seven judges, allowing both representation of each of the six member States and being an odd number of judges in case of a tie. One judge was appointed from each member state and the seventh seat rotated between the &quot;large Member States&quot; (West Germany, France and Italy). It became an institution of two additional Communities in 1957 when the European Economic Community (EEC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) were created, sharing the same courts with the European Coal and Steel Community.

The Maastricht Treaty was ratified in 1993, and created the European Union. The name of the Court did not change unlike the other institutions. The power of the Court resided in the Community pillar (the first pillar).

The Court gained power in 1997, with the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty. Issues from the third pillar were transferred to the first pillar. Previously, these issues were settled between the member states.

Following the entrance into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the ECJ&#x27;s official name was changed from the &quot;Court of Justice of the European Communities&quot; to the &quot;Court of Justice&quot; although in English it is still most common to refer to the Court as the European Court of Justice. The Court of First Instance was renamed as the &quot;General Court&quot;, and the term &quot;Court of Justice of the European Union&quot; now officially designates the two courts, as along with its specialised tribunals, taken together.

==Composition==
===Judges===
The Court of Justice consists of Judges who are assisted by 11 Advocates-General. The Judges and Advocates-General are appointed by common accord of the governments of the member states and hold office for a renewable term of six years. The treaties require that they are chosen from legal experts whose independence is &quot;beyond doubt&quot; and who possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices in their respective countries or who are of recognised competence. In practice, each member state nominates a judge whose nomination is then ratified by all other member states.

===President===
The President of the Court of Justice is elected from and by the judges for a renewable term of three years. The President presides over hearings and deliberations, directing both judicial business and administration (for example, the time table of the Court and Grand Chamber). He also assigns cases to the chambers for examination and appoints judge as rapporteurs called Judge-Rapporteur (reporting judges). The Council may also appoint assistant rapporteurs to assist the President in applications for interim measures and to assist rapporteurs in the performance of their duties.

===Vice-President===
The post of Vice-President was created by amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice in 2012. The duty of the Vice-President is to assist the President in the performance of his duties and to take the President&#x27;s place when the latter is prevented from attending or when the office of President is vacant. In 2012, judge Koen Lenaerts from Belgium became the first judge to carry out the duties of the Vice-President of the Court of Justice. Like the President of the Court of Justice, the Vice-President is elected by the members of the Court for a term of three years.

The judges are assisted by eleven Advocates General, whose number may be increased by the Council if the Court so requests. The Advocates General are responsible for presenting a legal opinion on the cases assigned to them. They can question the parties involved and then give their opinion on a legal solution to the case before the judges deliberate and deliver their judgment. The intention behind having Advocates General attached is to provide independent and impartial opinions concerning the Court&#x27;s cases. Unlike the Court&#x27;s judgments, the written opinions of the Advocates General are the works of a single author and are consequently generally more readable and deal with the legal issues more comprehensively than the Court, which is limited to the particular matters at hand.

The opinions of the Advocates General are advisory and do not bind the Court, but they are nonetheless very influential and are followed in the majority of cases. In a 2016 study, Arrebola and Mauricio measured the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court, showing that the Court is approximately 67% more likely to deliver a particular outcome if that was the opinion of the Advocate General. As of 2003, Advocates General are only required to give an opinion if the Court considers the case raises a new point of law.

According to Article 255 TFEU the judges and advocates-general are appointed by common accord of the governments of the Member States after consultation of a panel responsible for assessing candidates’ suitability.

===The Registrar===
The Registrar is the Court&#x27;s chief administrator. They manage departments under the authority of the Court&#x27;s president. The Court may also appoint one or more Assistant Registrars. They help the Court, the Chambers, the President and the Judges in all their official functions. They are responsible for the Registry as well as for the receipt, transmission and custody of documents and pleadings that have been entered in a register initialled by the President. They are Guardian of the Seals and responsible for the Court&#x27;s archives and publications.

The Registrar is responsible for the administration of the Court, its financial management and its accounts. The operation of the Court is in the hands of officials and other servants who are responsible to the Registrar under the authority of the President. The Court administers its own infrastructure; this includes the Translation Directorate, which, employed 44.7% of the staff of the institution.

===Chambers===
The Court can sit in plenary session, as a Grand Chamber of fifteen judges (including the president and vice-president), or in chambers of three or five judges. Plenary sittings are now very rare, and the court mostly sits in chambers of three or five judges. Each chamber elects its own president who is elected for a term of three years in the case of the five-judge chambers or one year in the case of three-judge chambers.

The Court is required to sit in full court in exceptional cases provided for in the treaties. The court may also decide to sit in full, if the issues raised are considered to be of exceptional importance. Sitting as a Grand Chamber is more common and can happen when a Member State or a Union institution, that is a party to certain proceedings, so requests, or in particularly complex or important cases.

The court acts as a collegial body: decisions are those of the court rather than of individual judges; no minority opinions are given and indeed the existence of a majority decision rather than unanimity is never suggested.
==Jurisdiction and powers==

It is the responsibility of the Court of Justice to ensure that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaties of the European Union. To enable it to carry out its duties, the Court has broad jurisdiction to hear various types of action. The Court has competence to, amongst other actions, rule on applications for annulment or actions for failure to act brought by a Member State or an institution; take actions against Member States for failure to fulfil obligations; and hear references for a preliminary ruling and appeals against decisions of the General Court.

===Actions for failure to fulfil obligations: infringement procedure===
Under Article 258 (ex Article 226) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court of Justice may determine whether a Member State has fulfilled its obligations under Union law.

That action may be brought by the commission – as is practically always the case – or by another Member State, although the cases of the latter kind remain extremely rare. Only six interstate cases have been decided by the court:
*&quot;France v. United Kingdom&quot; (case C-141/78), judgement of 14 October 1979 () on a British unilateral fishery protection measure, infringement because UK had to consult and seek approval of commission
*&quot;Belgium v. Spain&quot; (case C-388/95), judgement of 16 May 2000 () on a Spanish regulation ordering wine to be bottled in the region of production if it is using the designation of origin, no infringement because it is an authorised and justifiable restriction on the free movement of goods
*&quot;Spain v. United Kingdom&quot; (case C-145/04), judgement of 12 September 2006 () on Commonwealth voting rights in Gibraltar, no infringement
*&quot;Hungary v. Slovakia&quot; (case C-364/10), judgement of 16 October 2012 (): Slovakia denies entry to Hungarian president, no infringement
*&quot;Austria v. Germany&quot; (case C-591/17), judgement of 18 June 2019 () on the discriminatory German tax relief on the motor vehicle tax; infringement.
*&quot;Slovenia v. Croatia&quot; (case C-457/18), judgement of 31 January 2020 () on their border dispute.

The commencement of proceedings before the Court of Justice is preceded by a preliminary procedure conducted by the commission, which gives the Member State the opportunity to reply to the complaints against it. The court has decided that if the European Commission does not send the formal letter to the violating member state no-one can force them. If that procedure does not result in termination of the failure by the Member State, an action for breach of Union law may be brought before the Court of Justice.

If the Court finds that an obligation has not been fulfilled, the Member State concerned must terminate the breach without delay. If, after new proceedings are initiated by the commission, the Court of Justice finds that the Member State concerned has not complied with its judgment, it may, upon the request of the commission, impose on the Member State a fixed or a periodic financial penalty under Article 260 of the TFEU.

===Actions for annulment===
By an action for annulment under Article 263 (ex Article 230) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the applicant seeks the annulment of a measure (regulation, directive, decision or any measure with legal effects) adopted by an institution, body, office or agency of the EU. The Court of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought by a Member State against the European Parliament and/or against the council (apart from Council measures in respect of State aid, dumping and implementing powers) or brought by one Union institution against another. The General Court has jurisdiction, at first instance, in all other actions of this type and particularly in actions brought by individuals. The Court of Justice has the power to declare measures void under Article 264 (ex Article 231) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

===Actions for failure to act===
Under Article 265 (ex Article 232) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court of Justice and the General Court may also review the legality of a failure to act on the part of a Union institution, body, office or agency. However, such an action may be brought only after the institution has been called on to act. Where the failure to act is held to be unlawful, it is for the institution concerned to put an end to the failure by appropriate measures.

===Application for compensation based on non-contractual liability===
Under Article 268 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (and with reference to Article 340), the Court of Justice hears claims for compensation based on non-contractual liability, and rules on the liability of the Union for damage to citizens and to undertakings caused by its institutions or servants in the performance of their duties.

===Appeals on points of law===
Under Article 256 (ex Article 225) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, appeals on judgments given by the General Court may be heard by the Court of Justice &quot;only if&quot; the appeal is on a point of law. If the appeal is admissible and well founded, the Court of Justice sets aside the judgment of the General Court. Where the state of the proceedings so permits, the Court may itself decide the case. Otherwise, the Court must refer the case back to the General Court, which is bound by the decision given on appeal. No special procedure applies to allow for an appeal to proceed to the Court of Justice, except for cases which the General Court ruled on appeal against decisions of the independent Boards of Appeal of the EU agencies (as provided by Article 58a of the Statute of the Court).

===References for a preliminary ruling===

References for a preliminary ruling are specific to Union law. Whilst the Court of Justice is, by its very nature, the supreme guardian of Union legality, it is not the only judicial body empowered to apply EU law.

That task also falls to national courts, in as much as they retain jurisdiction to review the administrative implementation of Union law, for which the authorities of the Member States are essentially responsible; many provisions of the Treaties and of secondary legislation – regulations, directives and decisions – directly confer individual rights on nationals of Member States, which national courts must uphold.

National courts are thus by their nature the first guarantors of Union law. To ensure the effective and uniform application of Union legislation and to prevent divergent interpretations, national courts may, and sometimes must, turn to the Court of Justice and ask that it clarify a point concerning the interpretation of Union law, in order, for example, to ascertain whether their national legislation complies with that law. Petitions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling are described in Article 267 (ex Article 234) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

A reference for a preliminary ruling may also seek review of the legality of an act of Union law. The Court of Justice&#x27;s reply is not merely an opinion, but takes the form of a judgment or a reasoned order. The national court to which that is addressed is bound by the interpretation given. The Court&#x27;s judgment also binds other national courts before which a problem of the same nature is raised.

Although such a reference may be made only by a national court, which alone has the power to decide that it is appropriate do so, all the parties involved – that is to say, the Member States, the parties in the proceedings before national courts and, in particular, the commission – may take part in proceedings before the Court of Justice. In this way, a number of important principles of Union law have been laid down in preliminary rulings, sometimes in answer to questions referred by national courts of first instance.

Rulings end with a dictum which summarises the decision which the Court has made and may direct how costs are to be managed.

In the ECJ&#x27;s 2009 report it was noted that Belgian, German and Italian judges made the most referrals for an interpretation of EU law to the ECJ. However, the German Constitutional Court has rarely turned to the European Court of Justice, which is why lawyers and law professors warn about a future judicial conflict between the two courts. On 7 February 2014, the German Constitutional Court referred its first case to the ECJ for a ruling on a European Central Bank program. In 2017 the German Constitutional Court referred its second case to the ECJ but contrary to the binding nature of the Court of Justice&#x27;s preliminary rulings, the German Constitutional Court in 2020 refused to abide by the preliminary ruling. According to the German Constitutional Court, the Court of Justice&#x27;s answer was unintelligble. In June 2021, the European Commission announced it would start infringement proceedings against Germany for the German Constitutional Court&#x27;s refusal to abide by the Court of Justice&#x27;s preliminary ruling.

The constitutional courts of the member-states have in general been reluctant to refer a question to the European Court of Justice.

==Procedure and working languages==
Procedure before the ECJ is determined by its own rules of procedure. As a rule the Court&#x27;s procedure includes a written phase and an oral phase. The proceedings are conducted in one of the official languages of the European Union chosen by the applicant, although where the defendant is a member state or a national of a member state the applicant must choose an official language of that member state, unless the parties agree otherwise.

However, the working language of the court is the language of the case being heard with French being the common language for discussion, and it is in this language that the judges deliberate, pleadings and written legal submissions are translated and in which the judgment is drafted. The Advocates-General, by contrast, may work and draft their opinions in any official language, as they do not take part in any deliberations. These opinions are then translated into French for the benefit of the judges and their deliberations. However, all documents used in the case are in the language of that case and the only authentic version of the judgment handed down by either the Court of Justice or the General Court is that which appears in the language of the case.

==Seat==

All the EU&#x27;s judicial bodies are based in the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. The Court of Justice is seated in the &quot;Palais de la Cour de Justice&quot;.

Luxembourg City was chosen as the provisional seat of the Court on 23 July 1952 with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community. Its first hearing there was held on 28 November 1954 in a building known as Villa Vauban, the seat until 1959 when it would move to the Côte d&#x27;Eich building and then to the Palais building in 1972.

In 1965, the member states established Luxembourg City as the permanent seat of the Court. Future judicial bodies (Court of First Instance and Civil Service Tribunal) would also be based in the city. The decision was confirmed by the European Council at Edinburgh in 1992. However, there was no reference to future bodies being in Luxembourg City. In reaction to this, the Luxembourg government issued its own declaration stating it did not surrender those provisions agreed upon in 1965. The Edinburgh decision was attached to the Amsterdam Treaty. With the Treaty of Nice Luxembourg attached a declaration stating it did not claim the seat of the &quot;Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market&quot; – even if it were to become a judicial body.

==Landmark decisions==

Over time ECJ developed two essential rules on which the legal order rests: direct effect and primacy. The court first ruled on the direct effect of primary legislation in a case that, though technical and tedious, raised a fundamental principle of Union law. In &quot;Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen&quot; (1963), a Dutch transport firm brought a complaint against Dutch customs for increasing the duty on a product imported from Germany. The court ruled that the Community constitutes a new legal order, the subjects of which consist of not only the Member States but also their nationals. Consequently Community law may, if appropriately framed, confer rights on individuals which national courts are bound to protect. The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules. In &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot; (1964), the court ruled that member states had definitively transferred sovereign rights to the Community and Union law could not be overridden by domestic law.

Another early landmark case was &quot;Commission v Luxembourg and Belgium&quot; (1964), the &quot;Dairy Products&quot; case. In that decision the Court comprehensively ruled out any use by the Member States of the retaliatory measures commonly permitted by general international law within the European Economic Community. That decision is often thought to be the best example of the European legal order&#x27;s divergence with ordinary international law. &quot;Commission v Luxembourg and Belgium&quot; also has a logical connection with the nearly contemporaneous &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; and &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot; decisions, as arguably it is the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy that allow the European legal system to forgo any use of retaliatory enforcement mechanisms by the Member States. Links between the direct effect doctrine and the suppression of inter-state retaliation between the EU member states can be found in many of the landmark early decisions of the European Court of Justice, and in the writings of the influential French judge, Robert Lecourt, perhaps the most important member of the Court between 1962 and 1976.

Further, in the 1991 case &quot;Francovich v Italy&quot;, the ECJ established that Member States could be liable to pay compensation to individuals who suffered a loss by reason of the Member State&#x27;s failure to transpose an EU directive into national law.

==Criticism==
In 2008, the former German president Roman Herzog claimed that the ECJ was overstepping its powers. He was particularly critical of the court&#x27;s judgment &quot;Mangold v Helm&quot;, which over-ruled a German law that would discriminate in favour of older workers.

In 2011, the President of the Constitutional Court of Belgium, Marc Bossuyt, said that both the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights were taking on more powers by extending their competences, creating a threat of a &quot;government by judges&quot;. He claimed that foreign judges were not always aware of the financial implications of their judgements on national governments.

<text>The General Court, informally known as the European General Court (EGC), is a constituent court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the European Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance.

==Competence==
The General Court hears disputes (such as those by persons who have been refused a trade mark by EUIPO, the EU Trade Mark and designs registry).

The creation of the General Court instituted a judicial system based on two levels of jurisdiction: all cases heard at first instance by the General Court may be subject to a right of appeal to the Court of Justice on points of law only.

In view of the increasing number of cases brought before the General Court in the last five years, to relieve it of some of the caseload, the Treaty of Nice, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, provides for the creation of &#x27;judicial panels&#x27; in certain specific areas.

On 2 November 2004 the Council adopted a decision establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal. This new specialised tribunal, composed of seven judges, heard and determined at first instance disputes involving the European Civil Service. Its decisions were subject to a right of appeal before the General Court on points of law only. Decisions given by the General Court in this area might exceptionally be subject to review by the Court of Justice. The European Union Civil Service Tribunal was duly constituted into law on 2 December 2005. Despite the success in its mandate, it was dissolved on 1 September 2016, leading to the doubling of the number of judges at the General Court.

==Composition==
Since February 2020 the General Court is composed of 54 Judges; this follows a 2016 reform which increased the number of judges to two per member state by 2019, and the departure of the UK from the EU at the end of January 2020. The Judges are appointed for a renewable term of six years by common accord of the governments of the Member States. , there are 49 Judges in post: 23 member states have nominated both their judges, whilst Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia have nominated just one, and Slovenia has nominated neither.

The members of the General Court elect their president and the presidents of the Chambers of five Judges from among their number for a renewable period of three years.

There are no permanent Advocates General attached to the General Court (unlike the European Court of Justice, which has eleven Advocates General). However, the task of an Advocate General may be performed in a limited number of cases by a Judge nominated to do so. In practice this has been done occasionally.

===List of presidents===

=== List of vice-presidents ===
===List of judges===
* Judge continues to hold the office until their successor takes up the duties according to the Article 5(3) of the Protocol No. 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the EU

===List of former judges===
=== List of registrars ===
==Jurisdiction==
The General Court, like the Court of Justice, has the task of ensuring that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaties of the European Union and the provisions adopted by the competent Union institutions.

To fulfil its main task, the General Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine at first instance all direct actions brought by individuals and the Member States, with the exception of those to be assigned to a &#x27;judicial panel&#x27; and those reserved for the Court of Justice.

===Categories of direct actions===
*Actions for annulment
(against acts of the Union institutions)

*Actions for failure to act
(against inaction by the Union institutions)

*Actions for damages
(for the reparation of damage caused by unlawful conduct on the part of a Union institution)

*Actions based on an arbitration clause
(disputes concerning contracts in public or private law entered into by the Union, containing such a clause)

*Actions concerning the civil service (disputes between the Union and its officials and other servants) – from 2005 to 2016 these cases were transferred to the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, but returned to the General Court when its size was doubled

&quot;Subject-matter of direct actions: all matters, including:&quot;

*agriculture
*State aid
*competition
*commercial policy
*regional policy
*social policy
*institutional law
*trade mark and design right law
*transport

==Procedure==
The General Court has its own Rules of Procedure. The 1991 rules were replaced by revised Rules of Procedure which came into effect on 1 July 2015. In the main, the Court&#x27;s procedure includes a written phase and an oral phase. The proceedings are conducted in a language at the petitioner&#x27;s choosing. As in the European Court of Justice, the working language of the Court is nevertheless French, and this includes the language the judges deliberate in and the drafting language of preliminary reports and judgments.

The Court is separated into 9 divisions (called &#x27;chambers&#x27;) sat by 3-judge benches, except for the 7th division whose bench is sat by 4 judges. Each chamber has an extended composition of 5 judges. Cases are assigned by the President of the Court to a relevant divisional presiding judge. The presiding judge assigned to the case then chooses a judge-reporter (&quot;judge-rapporteur&quot;) from the judges of the division, whose clerks write a preliminary report (&quot;rapport préalable&quot;) based on the parties&#x27; pleadings and applicable law.

At the close of the written phase and, as the case may be, on adoption of measures of inquiry, the case is argued orally in open court. The proceedings are interpreted simultaneously, if necessary, into various official languages of the European Union. The judges then deliberate based on a draft judgment prepared by the judge-reporter. The Court&#x27;s final judgment is handed down in open court.

<text>Whilst the [[House of Lords]] of the United Kingdom is the upper chamber of Parliament and has government ministers, for many centuries it had a judicial function. It functioned as a court of first instance for the trials of peers and for impeachments, and as a court of last resort in the United Kingdom and prior, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of England.

Appeals were technically not to the House of Lords, but rather to the King-in-Parliament. In 1876, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act devolved the appellate functions of the House to an Appellate Committee, composed of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (informally referred to as Law Lords). They were then appointed by the Lord Chancellor in the same manner as other judges.

During the 20th and early 21st century, the judicial functions were gradually removed. Its final trial of a peer was in 1935, and the use of special courts for such trials was abolished in 1948. The procedure of impeachment became seen as obsolete. In 2009, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom became the new court of final appeal in the UK, with the extant Law Lords becoming Supreme Court Justices and the appointment of new Lords ceasing.

==History==

Parliament&#x27;s role in deciding litigation originated from the similar role of the Royal Court, where the king dispensed justice. Parliament grew out of the court and took on many of its roles. As lower courts were established, the House of Lords came to be the court of last resort in criminal and civil cases, except that in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary remained the highest court in criminal matters (except for 1713–1781).

Parliament originally did not hear appeals as a court might; rather, it heard petitions for the judgments of lower courts to be reversed. The House of Commons ceased considering such petitions in 1399, leaving the House of Lords, effectively, as the nation&#x27;s court of last resort. The Lords&#x27; jurisdiction later began to decline; only five cases were heard between 1514 and 1589, and no cases between 1589 and 1621. In 1621, the House of Lords resumed its judicial role when King James I sent the petition of Edward Ewer, a persistent litigant, to be considered by the House of Lords. Petitions for the House of Lords to review the decisions of lower courts began to increase once again. After Ewer, 13 further cases would be heard in 1621. The House of Lords appointed a Committee for Petitions. At first, the Clerk of the Parliaments would bring petitions to the house, and the whole house could decide if they should or should not be referred to the Committee. As the number of petitions increased, the committee gained the power to reject petitions itself.

Petitions to the House of Lords did not have to seek reversal of lower court judgments; often, petitions were brought directly to the Lords without prior consideration in the inferior judiciary. The practice of bringing cases directly to the Lords, however, ended with the case of &quot;Thomas Skinner v East India Company&quot;. Skinner had established his business&#x27;s trading base in Asia while few British restrictions on trade existed; later the base was seized by the Honourable East India Company which had been granted a monopoly. In 1667, the king, Charles II, referred the case to the Lords after failed attempts at arbitration.

Replying to Skinner&#x27;s petition, the East India Company objected that the case was one of first instance, and that the Lords therefore should not have accepted it. Notwithstanding the company&#x27;s protests, the House of Lords proceeded with the matter. Though lawyers argued that the House could intervene only after the lower courts had failed to remedy the case, the Lords decided in Skinner&#x27;s favour in 1668. The East India Company then petitioned the House of Commons, arguing that the acceptance of a case in the first instance by the Lords was &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;extraordinary&quot;.

A famous dispute then broke out between the two houses; the Commons ordered the imprisonment of Thomas Skinner and the Lords retaliated by ordering the imprisonment of the company chairman. In 1670, Charles II requested both houses to abandon the case. When they refused, he ordered that all references to the case be expunged from the journals of both houses and that neither body continue with the dispute. The House of Lords then ceased to hear petitions in the first instance, considering them only after the lower courts had failed to remedy them.

Even afterwards the houses clashed over jurisdiction in 1675. The Commons felt that the upper house (as it was often accurately termed until 1911) had breached its privileges by considering cases with members of the Commons as defendants. After the Lords considered one of these, &quot;Shirley v Fagg&quot; (see Sir John Fagg), the Commons warned them to &quot;have regard for their Privileges&quot;. Soon the dispute became worse when two more such cases emerged. These included Thomas Dalmahoy and Arthur Onslow (grandfather of Arthur Onslow, the noted Speaker (1728–1761)). One case was from the Court of Chancery, and the other was from the equity branch of the Court of the Exchequer. The Commons unsuccessfully contended the Lords could hear petitions challenging decisions of common law courts but not those from courts of equity.

The dispute rested during prorogation commencing 1675. After the parliament reassembled in 1677, the cases involving members of the House of Commons were quietly dropped and neither House revisited the dispute.

In 1707, England united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. The question then arose as to whether or not appeals could be taken from Scottish Courts. The Acts of Union provided that &quot;no causes in Scotland be by the courts of Chancery, Queen&#x27;s Bench, Common Pleas or any other court in Westminster Hall; and that the said courts &quot;or any other of the like nature&quot; after the union shall have no power to cognosce, review or alter the acts or sentences of judicatures in Scotland, or stop the execution of the same&quot; (emphasis added). The acts were silent on appeals to the House of Lords, unless they be deemed of &#x27;like nature&#x27; to Westminster Hall, in which case it would be banned. In 1708, the first Scottish appeal to the Lords arrived, and it was accepted by the House. In 1709, the House ordered that no decree of the lower Scottish courts could be executed while an appeal was pending; that rule was reversed only by the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1808 empowering the lower court to determine if an appeal justified the stay of its decree. In 1713, the House of Lords began to consider appeals from Scotland&#x27;s highest criminal court, the High Court of Justiciary. In 1781, when deciding &quot;Bywater v Lord Advocate&quot;, the House recognised that before the Union, no further appeal lay. The House agreed not to hear further Scottish criminal appeals.

The Kingdom of Ireland was politically separate from Great Britain and subordinate to it. The Irish House of Lords regarded itself as the final court of appeal for Ireland, but the British Declaratory Act 1719 asserted the right of further appeal from the Irish Lords to the British Lords. This was odious to the Irish Patriot Party and was eventually repealed as part of the Constitution of 1782. Appellate jurisdiction for Ireland returned to Westminster when the Acts of Union 1800 abolished the Parliament of Ireland.

A 1627 lunacy inquisition judgment was appealed from Chancery to the Privy Council of England rather than the House of Lords. Bypassing the Lords was repeated at the next such appeal, in 1826 from the Irish Chancery.

==Appeals==
===Jurisdiction===
The judicial business of the House of Lords was regulated by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. Generally, only important or particularly complex appeals came before the House of Lords. The only further appeal from the House of Lords was to the European courts (the European Court of Justice or the European Court of Human Rights), and only then in matters concerning either European Community law or the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Law Lords did not have the power to exercise judicial review over Acts of Parliament. However, in 1972 the UK signed up to be a member of the European Union, and with this accepted European law to be supreme in certain areas so long as Parliament does not explicitly override it (see the &quot;Factortame&quot; case). The doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty still applied – under UK constitutional law, Parliament could have at any time unilaterally decided to dismiss the supremacy of European law. In common with other courts in the European Union, however, the Law Lords referred points involving European Union law to the European Court of Justice. The Lords could also declare a law inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights pursuant to section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Whilst this power was shared with the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the High Court of Justiciary, the Court of Session, and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, such declarations were considered so important that the question would almost inevitably be determined in the House of Lords on appeal. However, the challenged law in question was not struck down, and the courts are required to enforce them; it remained up to Parliament to amend the law.

In civil cases, the House of Lords could hear appeals from the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland and the Scottish Court of Session. Alternatively, cases raising important legal points could &quot;leapfrog&quot; from the High Court of England and Wales or High Court in Northern Ireland. In England, Wales or Northern Ireland; leave (or permission) to appeal could be granted either by the court whose decision is appealed or the House of Lords itself. Leave to appeal is not a feature of the Scottish legal system and appeals proceeded when two Advocates certified the appeal as suitable.

In criminal cases, the House of Lords could hear appeals from the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the High Court of England and Wales, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, but did not hear appeals from the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland. In addition to obtaining leave to appeal, an appellant also had to obtain a certificate from the lower court stating that a point of general public importance was involved. The effect of this was that, in criminal matters, the House of Lords could not control its own docket.

===Procedure===
====Selection of appeals====

Permission to appeal could be granted by an Appeal Committee. The Committee consisted of three Lords of Appeal or Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. Appeal Committees normally convened fifteen to twenty times per year, and their members were selected by the Principal Clerk of the Judicial Office of the House of Lords. Appeal Committees could not meet while Parliament was prorogued or dissolved. Formerly, leave to appeal was unnecessary if two solicitors certified the reasonableness of the case. This procedure was abolished in English cases in 1934 and in Northern Irish cases in 1962; Scottish cases continued to come before the House of Lords in a similar manner.

As of 1982, the House of Lords had relatively little control of its caseload. About 80% of the civil caseload and 60% of the criminal caseload came to the House of Lords either by right or by leave of a lower court, rather than by leave of an Appeal Committee.

====Hearing of appeals====

An Appellate Committee, normally consisting of five Lords of Appeal in Ordinary or Lords of Appeal, heard the actual appeals. It was not a standing committee, and hence there was no one Appellate Committee; a separate Appellate Committee was formed to hear each appeal. There was no formal attempt to ensure that any of the Law Lords who had sat on the Appeal Committee which granted leave to hear the appeal would also sit on the Appellate Committee which heard the merits of the appeal; the overlap could be anywhere from zero to all three. The Lord Chancellor was technically responsible for the selection of membership of Appellate Committees, but delegated this duty to his Permanent Secretary, who then escalated only the hardest selection questions back to the Lord Chancellor. At the end of each legal term, the Permanent Secretary met with the Principal Clerk of the Judicial Office and the Judicial Clerk to the Privy Council to discuss the appeals coming to the House of Lords and the Privy Council. Then the Secretary would put together the Appellate Committees for the appeals to be heard in the upcoming term, while keeping in mind that the Law Lords would also be hearing Privy Council appeals.

The minimum number of Law Lords that could form an Appellate Committee was four. Seven Lords could sit in particularly important cases. On 4 October 2004 a Committee of nine Lords, including both the Senior Law Lord Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Second Senior Law Lord Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, was convened to hear challenges to the indefinite detention of suspects under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, and on 16 December it announced an 8–1 ruling against the Government. Only five Appellate Committees ever comprised nine members. Three of these occurred after 2001.

The determination of each Appellate Committee was normally final, but the House of Lords (in common with the Court of Appeal and High Court of England and Wales) retained an inherent jurisdiction to reconsider any of its previous decisions; this includes the ability to vacate that decision and make a new one. It was exceptional for the House of Lords to exercise this power, but a number of important cases such as &quot;Dimes v Grand Junction Canal&quot; (a seminal case on bias in England and Wales) proceeded in this way.

A recent example of the House of Lords reconsidering an earlier decision occurred in 1999, when the judgment in the case on the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, the former President of Chile, was overturned on the grounds that one of the Lords on the committee, Lord Hoffmann, was a director of a charity closely allied with Amnesty International, which was a party to the appeal and had an interest to achieve a particular result. The matter was reheard by a panel of seven Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

The tradition that appeals should be heard by Appellate Committees and not by the full House of Lords developed relatively late, after the Second World War. Historically, appeals were heard in the House of Lords Chamber by a full sitting of the House of Lords (although the Law Lords were doing the actual work). The Lords would sit for regular sessions after four in the evening, and the judicial sessions were held prior to that time. When the Commons Chamber was bombed in 1941, the Commons began to conduct their debates in the Lords Chamber, and the Lords moved into the King&#x27;s Robing Room. After the war, the noise of postwar construction work rendered the Robing Room unusable. It was proposed in 1948, as a temporary measure, that the Lords should appoint an Appellate Committee small enough to sit in upstairs committee rooms to do the actual work of hearing appeals. The temporary measure later became a permanent one, and appeals continued to be heard in committee rooms. 

No judicial robes were worn by the judges during hearings; they wore ordinary business suits. The manner in which the Appellate Committees conducted their hearings was agonizingly slow, as observed by an American lawyer in 1975. In an appeal in a patent infringement case, it took almost seven days to go through opening argument because counsel for the appellant was expected to read out loud all relevant portions of the Court of Appeal opinion and the trial court record (all of which had already been provided in advance to the Committee in hard copy format), while interpolating extensive comment and argument, and digressing into lengthy exchanges with the Committee members. Next, the respondent delivered their response and then the appellant delivered their rebuttal, while again digressing into back-and-forth exchanges with the Committee members. As long as the appellant&#x27;s opening had fairly summarized all relevant facts in the record (both favorable and adverse), as they were expected to do, these latter arguments were more closely focused on the law and the application of law to fact. The appellant submitted on the ninth day with the words, &quot;My Lords, those are my submissions.&quot; On behalf of the House of Lords, the Committee took the appeal under &quot;advisement&quot;, and the usher shouted, &quot;Clear the bar!&quot; This was a signal that all barristers, solicitors, and others present for the hearing were expected to leave the room immediately, so the Committee could begin its deliberations.

====Delivery of judgment====

Although each Appellate Committee was essentially acting as an appellate court, it could not issue judgments in its own name, but could only recommend to the House of Lords how to dispose of an appeal. This is why all the Law Lords framed their opinions in the form of recommendations (for example, &quot;I would dismiss the appeal&quot; or &quot;I would allow the appeal&quot;). In British constitutional theory, the Law Lords&#x27; opinions were originally intended to be individually delivered as speeches in debate before the full House of Lords, upon a motion to consider the Committee&#x27;s &quot;report&quot; on a particular appeal. The actual reading of full speeches before the House was abandoned in 1963, after which it became possible for a deceased Law Lord to give a speech.

Judgment was given in the main House of Lords Chamber during what was in theory a full sitting of the House to deal with judicial matters. These sittings were traditionally held at 10:30 a.m. in the morning, while legislative and deliberative business was dealt with in the afternoons. The House of Lords&#x27; staff would notify counsel that judgment was imminent about five or six days before the relevant sitting, and provide advance copies of the Committee&#x27;s written report (the Lords&#x27; written speeches) and the House minutes (in plain English, a script of the &quot;pro forma&quot; questions to be raised and voted upon) to counsel when they arrived for the sitting. By the time the judicial functions of the House of Lords were abolished, the standard procedure was to hold such sittings at 9:45 a.m. on Wednesday mornings and to provide counsel with the Law Lords&#x27; speeches in advance on the preceding Friday.

Only the Law Lords on the relevant Appellate Committee spoke, but other Lords were free to attend, although they rarely did so. In plain English, the point of this &quot;quaint ceremony&quot; was that the Law Lords who had just heard the case as an Appellate Committee were reporting back to themselves, formally sitting as the House of Lords, and voting to adopt their own report on the matter. By the 1970s, the procedure had become such an arid formality that the same Law Lord who presided over the Appellate Committee also presided over the full sitting in which judgment was given. Thus, he would repeatedly move away from the Woolsack to make a motion in his capacity as a member of the Appellate Committee, and then move back to the Woolsack in his capacity as the presiding officer of the House of Lords to recite the traditional formula which meant that a majority had voted for the motion: &quot;As many as are of that opinion will say &#x27;Content&#x27;, to the contrary, &#x27;Not Content&#x27;. The contents have it.&quot;

After the abandonment of reading speeches in full, each Law Lord who had heard the appeal would rise only to acknowledge they &quot;have had the advantage of reading the speech&quot; (or speeches) prepared by the other Law Lords on the Appellate Committee, and to state they would allow the appeal or would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given in their own speech or in another Law Lord&#x27;s speech. After all five members of the Committee had spoken, the question was put to the House: &quot;That the report from the Appellate Committee be agreed to.&quot; The House then voted on that question and on other questions related thereto; the decisions on these questions constituted the House&#x27;s formal judgment. In theory, the full House was voting on the recommendations of the Appellate Committee, but by custom only the Law Lords on the Appellate Committee actually voted, while all other Lords (including all other Law Lords) always abstained. 

If the House of Lords was in recess, the Lord Chancellor or Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary could recall the House to give judgment. Judicial sittings could occur while Parliament was prorogued, and, with the authorisation of the Sovereign, dissolved. In the latter case, the meeting was not of the full House, but was rather of the Law Lords acting in the name of the full House. Judgment could not be given between the summoning of a Parliament and the State Opening. No Parliamentary business is conducted during that time, except the taking of oaths of allegiance and the election of a Speaker by the House of Commons.

====Related courts====

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which included the twelve Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (now the Justices of the Supreme Court) as well as other senior judges in the Privy Council, has little domestic jurisdiction. The Committee hears appeals from the appellate courts of many independent Commonwealth nations and crown dependencies. The Judicial Committee&#x27;s domestic jurisdiction was very limited, hearing only cases on the competency of the devolved legislatures in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Precedents set in devolution cases, but not in other matters, are binding on all other courts, which included the House of Lords. The &#x27;devolution issues&#x27; were transferred from the Privy Council to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; however, the former continues to hear Commonwealth appeals.

==Trials of peers==

In mediaeval times, feudal courts had jurisdiction only in their subjects; peers of the realm were subjects directly to the king, so could only be tried by what would become the House of Lords. The right of peers to be tried by peers, rather than directly by royal justice, was one ceded reluctantly from the Crown, and eventually only applied to treason and felony.

Peers of Scotland were granted the privilege of trial by the House after the union of 1707; peers of Ireland were, after the union of 1801, entitled to be elected to the Commons, but during such service their privileges, including the privilege of trial in the House of Lords, abated. Peeresses in their own right and wives or widows of peers were also entitled to trial in such a court, though they were never members of the House of Lords. Widows of peers who later married commoners lost the privilege.

===Procedure===
After a peer was indicted by the normal criminal process, the case was brought before the Court of King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Bench. The judges of that court could not accept any plea of guilty or not guilty, except a plea that the crime in question was previously pardoned. If pardon was not pleaded, the court issued a writ of certiorari moving the indictment to the House of Lords. The Lord High Steward presided, but the entire House could decide all legal, factual or procedural disputes. At the end, the Lords then voted, starting with the most junior baron, and proceeding in order of precedence, ending with the Lord High Steward. Jurors vote on (after making) oath or affirmation; a lord voted (up)on his honour. Bishops could not be tried in the House, because they were not peers, but they could participate as judges in a trial, except in the verdict. If Parliament was not sitting the case would be referred to the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court. He as president was sole judge of questions of law or procedure, but a jury of Lords Triers determined the verdict. (He selected, at his discretion, any 23 or more peers to be Lords Triers.) A simple majority of votes was enough to convict, but this could not be less than 12. Since the Crown appointed the Lord High Steward, peers lamented that in what may well be a political persecution this procedure put the accused at great disadvantage (since the Crown could appoint a hostile Lord High Steward who could select hostile peers as Lords Triers), and in the late 17th century made repeated efforts to ameliorate this.

===Abolition===
A peer&#x27;s trial for treason or felony in the House of Lords was as much an obligation as it was a privilege; from 1391 it could not be disclaimed in favour of a trial by jury. A peerage trial offered significant disadvantages over a jury trial. Whereas a commoner could, and can, challenge the members of his or her trial&#x27;s jury, peers had no such right since all lords temporal participated in the verdict; furthermore, since the House was itself the highest court of the land, no appeals were possible from the decision except for royal pardon, in contrast to the criminal court system for commoners. Nor was there leniency for any convicted peer compared to a commoner convicted of the same sentencethe privilege of a peer to be excused for a first offence was abolished in 1841, and the Lords&#x27; decisions on punishment were constrained to those provided by law. In any event, the Lords relied almost exclusively on the advice tendered by royal justices, who were the same people presiding over standard criminal cases. The sole deliberation taken by the House for its final trial of a peerthat of Lord de Clifford for vehicular manslaughter in 1935was to ask for the attorney&#x27;s opinion of the case before unanimously voting to acquit de Clifford based on it.

The practice&#x27;s persistence was in large part because so few trials occurred after the Glorious Revolutiononly two in the 20th century. By the late 1930s, the opinion of the House had turned solidly against continuing the privilege; the majority in favour of its abolition were largely holders of newly-created privileges resenting the inconvenience it caused accused peers, whereas the minority who still supported it were those holding old peerages who saw it as a privilege of the House as a whole. In 1936, a year after the de Clifford trial, the Lords voted to abolish the privilege but the legislation was not given time in the Commons by the government before the session ended.

In 1948, the First Attlee ministry introduced the Criminal Justice Act 1948 to abolish penal servitude. While the bill was in the Lords, Viscount Simon added an amendment to abolish the trial of peers by the House of Lords, which was agreed to in both houses and became law.

===In popular culture===
The novel &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; (1926) by Dorothy L. Sayers depicts in the House of Lords the fictional trial of a duke who is accused of murder. Sayers researched and used the then current trial procedures. &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949) comedy from Ealing Studios features an almost identical scene.

==Impeachment==

===Theoretical device of impeachment===
The UK constitutional institutions since early Victorian Britain have been careful to uphold a Diceyan emphasis on separation of powers (finalised with the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s ending of his judicial office thwarted by a change of government in the 1870s, which that took place in the 2000s). The Lords legally has power to try impeachments after the House of Commons agrees and words &quot;Articles of Impeachment&quot;, which it forwards.

===Mechanism of impeachment===
Originally, the Lords held that it applied only to peers and only for certain crimes. In 1681 the Commons passed a resolution that it may forward articles against anyone for any crime. The Lords tries/tried impeachment by simple majority. When the Commons demand judgment, the Lords may proceed to pronounce the sentence against the accused. The Commons may refuse to press for judgment whereupon the accused, convicted, faces no punishment.

The accused could not, under the Act of Settlement 1701, obtain and plead a pardon to avoid trial in the House of Lords; but could if liable to trial before the lesser courts. Any convict could be pardoned (absolutely) by the Sovereign. In Britain the House of Lords trials were in direct substitution of regular trial; they could impose the same sentences, and the Sovereign could pardon the convict like any other. This combined jurisdiction differs from many other nations. For instance, in the United States, impeachment serves only as a mechanism for removing officials in the executive and judicial branches; the Senate can only remove the accused from office and optionally bar them from future offices of public trust or honour, the President may not issue pardons in cases of impeachment, and an impeached officeholder remains liable to subsequent trial and punishment in the ordinary courts.

===Incidence===
Impeachment was originally used to try those who were too powerful to come before the ordinary courts. During the reign of the Lancastrians, impeachments were very frequent, but they reduced under the Tudors, when bills of attainder became the preferred method. During the reign of the Stuarts, impeachment was revived; Parliament used it as a tool against the king&#x27;s ministers during a time when it felt it needed to resist the tyranny of the Crown. The last impeachment trials were the impeachment of Warren Hastings from 1788 to 1795 and the impeachment of Viscount Melville in 1806.

===Peerage claims===

Such claims and disputes were in early centuries a matter for the monarch alone; &quot;Erskine and May&quot; states (2019) the House is regarded as guardian of its own privileges and membership. Theoretically, the Crown, as &quot;fount of honour&quot;, is entitled to decide all questions relating to such disputes. In practice such decisions are made where disputed only after full reference to the House of Lords.

Since the taking effect of the House of Lords Act 1999, the House of Lords may declare the law on matters of peerage
*by reference from the Crown (with whom the power at root resides, arranged by the Lord Chancellor considering all such regular claims via the Crown Office);
*in any petition to enter the register for by-elections (those with a view to entering the House);

where the Lord Chancellor has recommended it is proper to be considered by the Committee for Privileges and Conduct. Once the latter reports to the House, the House usually issues a concurring resolution which is reported to the Crown which by custom confirms the decision by directing entries on the Roll of Peerage. Each decision is deemed to turn on its own facts and is not of binding precedent value for other cases.

==Constitution of the Lords==

===Appeals===
At first, all members of the House of Lords could hear appeals. The role of lay members of the House in judicial sittings faded in the early nineteenth century. Soon, only &quot;Law Lords&quot;—the Lord Chancellor and Lords who held judicial office—came to hear appeals. The last time that lay members voted on a case was in 1834. The Lords later came close to breaching this convention a decade later, when the House was considering the case of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, an Irish politician. A panel of Law Lords—the Lord Chancellor, three former Lord Chancellors, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland and a former Lord Chief Justice—opined on the matter. Immediately thereafter, lay members began to make speeches about the controversial case. The Lord President of the Privy Council then advised that lay members should not intervene after the Law Lords had announced their opinions. The last time a lay peer attempted to intervene was in 1883; in that case, the Lord&#x27;s vote was ignored.

No provision stood whereby the number of Law Lords could be regulated. In 1856, it was desired to increase their number by creating a life peerage. The House, however, ruled that the recipient, Sir James Parke, was not entitled thereby to sit as a Lord of Parliament.

Under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, the Sovereign nominated a number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary to sit in the House of Lords. In practice, they were appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister (they were not covered by the Judicial Appointments Commission established in 2006). Only lawyers who had held high judicial office for a minimum of two years or barristers who had been practising for fifteen years were to be appointed Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. By convention, at least two were Scottish and at least one from Northern Ireland.

Lords of Appeal in Ordinary held the rank of Baron and seats in the House for life. Under the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 they ceased to be such at 70, but could be permitted by ministerial discretion to hold office as old as 75. The Act provided for appointment of only two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, but as of 2009 twelve could be appointed; this number could have been further raised by a Statutory Instrument approved by both Houses of Parliament. They were, by custom, appointed to the Privy Council if not already members. They served on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, highest court of appeal in certain cases such as from some Commonwealth countries. They were often called upon to chair important public inquiries, such as the Hutton inquiry.

Two of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were designated the Senior and Second Senior of their type. Formerly, the most senior of the Law Lords took these posts. Since 1984, however, the Senior and Second Senior Lords were appointed independently.

Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were joined by Lords of Appeal. These were lawyers who are already members of the House under other Acts (including the Life Peerages Act 1958 and the House of Lords Act 1999) who held or had held high judicial office. High judicial officers included judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the Inner House of the Court of Session and the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. Additionally, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary who had reached the age of seventy could become a Lord of Appeal. Between 1996 and 2001, Lord Cooke of Thorndon, a retired judge of an overseas appellate court (the Court of Appeal of New Zealand), served as a Lord of Appeal.

Judicial appeals were heard by Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and Lords of Appeal under the age of seventy-five. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were entitled to emoluments. Thus, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ceased to be paid at the time they ceased to hold office and became Lords of Appeal. The Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary received £185,705 as of 2009 (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales was the only judicial figure who received a higher salary). The other Lords of Appeal in Ordinary received £179,431.

By convention, only the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and Lords of Appeal participated in judicial matters. When the House gave judgment, the regular quorum of three applied, but these had to be Law Lords. Normally, only the Law Lords on the Appellate Committee who were deciding the case voted when the House gave judgment.

===Trials===
The Lord High Steward presided over the House of Lords in trials of peers, and also in impeachment trials when a peer was tried for high treason; otherwise, the Lord High Chancellor presided. The post of Lord High Steward was originally hereditary, held by the Earls of Leicester. After the rebellion of one of the Lord High Stewards, the position was forfeited and re-granted to Edmund Crouchback, but it later merged in the Crown. The position was created again, but its holder died without heirs in 1421, and the post has since been left vacant. Whenever a Lord High Steward became necessary—at certain trials and at coronation—one was appointed for the occasion only. Once the trial or coronation concluded, the Lord High Steward would break his white staff of office, thereby symbolising the end of his service in that position. Often, when a Lord High Steward was necessary for trials of peers, the Lord Chancellor was appointed to the post.

The Lord High Steward merely presided at trials, and the whole House could vote. The position of the Lords Spiritual (the Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England with seats in the House), however, was unclear. The Lords Spiritual, though members of the House, were not considered &quot;ennobled in blood&quot; like the temporal peers. Though they retained the right to vote in both trials of peers and impeachment trials, it was customary for them to withdraw from the chamber immediately before the House pronounced judgment. This convention was followed only before the final vote on guilt and not on procedural questions arising during the trial.

When the House was not officially in session, trials were heard by the Court of the Lord High Steward.

===Peerage claims===

If the claim is a difficult one, or if the Lord Chancellor is not satisfied that the claimant has established a right to succession, the matter is referred to the Lords, which then refers it to its Committee. In hearing such claims it sits with three current holders of high judicial office, who are granted the same speaking and voting rights as members of the Committee.

==Reform==
In 1873, the Government introduced a bill to abolish the judicial role of the House of Lords Judicial Committee in English cases (Scottish and Irish appeals were to be preserved). The bill passed, and was to come into force in November 1874. Before that date, however, the Liberal Government of William Ewart Gladstone fell. The new Conservative Government, led by Benjamin Disraeli, passed a bill to postpone the coming-into-force of the bill until 1875. By then, however, the sentiments of the Parliament had changed. The relevant provisions of the bill were repealed, and the jurisdiction of the House of Lords came to be regulated under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.

Concerns were chiefly around the Lord Chancellor, able and prone to sit in judicial and legislative/executive bodies (judicial committee &quot;and&quot; house). The other Law Lords would not participate in the latter. In the final 42 years of such office holder&#x27;s possible participation in judicial sittings this was for a minority of their sessions:
Lord Chancellors tended to recuse themselves (not sit) when the Government had a stake in the outcome; during a debate in the Lords, Lord Irvine said, &quot;I am unwilling to lay down any detailed rules because it is ever a question of judgment combined with a need to ensure that no party to an appeal could reasonably believe or suspect that the Lord Chancellor might, because of his other roles, have an interest in a specific outcome. Examples might be where the lawfulness of a decision or action by any Minister or department might be at issue.&quot; Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 the Lord Chancellor is no longer a judge.

Part 3 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which came into force on 1 October 2009, abolished the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords, and transferred it to a new body, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Among the initial Justices of the Supreme Court were ten of the twelve then existing Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (Law Lords). One of the Law Lords (Lord Scott of Foscote) had retired on 30 September 2009 and the 12th, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, became the Master of the Rolls (one of two sub-head judges, that for civil justice, in England and Wales). The 11th place on the Supreme Court was filled by Lord Clarke (previously the Master of the Rolls), a member of the House of Lords who was the first Justice to be appointed directly to the Supreme Court. The 12th place was initially vacant. Formally addressed as (customarily styled) &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;, later appointees are not elevated to the House of Lords.

<text>William Anthony Perry (born December 16, 1962) is an American former professional football defensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons, primarily with the Chicago Bears. Nicknamed &quot;the Refrigerator&quot;, he played college football for the Clemson Tigers, winning ACC Player of the Year, and was selected by the Bears in the first round of the 1985 NFL draft. Perry gained popularity during his rookie season as a member of the 1985 Bears team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XX. During the season, Perry occasionally played fullback in goal line situations and set the record for the heaviest player to score a touchdown at 335 lb (152 kg). He remains the heaviest player to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl and has the largest Super Bowl ring at size 23–25.

==Early life==
Perry was born in Aiken, South Carolina, tenth of twelve children (eight sons and four daughters) of Hollie Perry Sr (d. 2013), a house painter, and Inez (née Smith), a school dietitian. He has stated in an interview that &quot;Even when I was little, I was big&quot;; by the time he was 11 years old, he weighed 300 pounds. Frequently ridiculed for his weight while growing up, Perry took advantage of his athleticism to silence his critics. He attended Aiken High School and played as a 295-pound nose guard on the school&#x27;s football team and ran on its track team. During an exercise in which his coach instructed all of his fastest players to line up for a 100-yard dash, Perry joined the group of running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs and eventually was timed as the 6th fastest runner on the entire team, with a time of 11 seconds flat. He was also able to run the 100 meters in under 12 seconds, and competed in the shot put event, recording a top-throw of . He could also execute 360-degree dunks on regulation basketball hoops and perform a complicated dive into the swimming pool.

==College career==
Perry&#x27;s athletic performances earned him a full-ride scholarship to attend Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, where he played for coach Danny Ford&#x27;s Clemson Tigers football team from 1981 to 1984.

As a freshman in 1981, Perry earned his &quot;Refrigerator&quot; nickname when a fellow player could barely squeeze into an elevator with Perry and their laundry which they were taking to be washed. The player, Ray Brown, said &quot;Man, you&#x27;re about as big as a refrigerator.&quot; Perry was a member of Clemson&#x27;s 1981 national championship team.

Perry was recognized three times as an All-American: he was selected to the Associated Press&#x27; third-team as a sophomore, earned consensus first-team honors as a junior, and was again a member of the first-team as a senior, as chosen by United Press International and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

==Professional career==
In 1985, he was selected in the first round of the 1985 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears; he had been hand-picked by coach Mike Ditka. However, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who had a highly acrimonious relationship with Ditka, called Perry a &quot;wasted draft-pick&quot;. Perry soon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and Ryan.

Perry&#x27;s &quot;Refrigerator&quot; nickname followed him into the NFL and he quickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called him &quot;Biscuit,&quot; as in &quot;one biscuit shy of 350 pounds&quot;.

While Ryan refused to play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was near the opponents&#x27; goal line or in fourth and short situations, either as a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton. During his rookie season he rushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Ditka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him during five-yard sprint exercises. About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally began to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive lineman. Perry even had the opportunity to run the ball during the Bears&#x27; win in Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his popularity and contributions to the team&#x27;s success. The first time he got the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw his first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the ball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew in the process).

His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional football player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while the ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12.

Perry went on to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In his ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which hampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording 29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of 71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns, and had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a comeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europa).

==Beyond football==
===Music===
During his popular tenure with the Bears, Perry participated in the recording of three rap records, all in 1985, in addition to the team&#x27;s popular &quot;Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;. Walter Payton and Perry recorded an anti-drug, pro-peace rap tune entitled &quot;Together&quot; which was written by four Evanston, Illinois teens. &quot;Together&quot; was re-released in 1999 with part of the profits going to the Walter Payton Foundation.

===Media appearances===
In November 2000 Perry participated in a boxing match against former NFL player Bob Sapp during a Toughman Contest which aired on FX, Perry lost the bout. In 2002, Perry participated in (and lost) a &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot; match against 7&#x27;7&quot; former NBA player Manute Bol.

Perry participated in a World Wrestling Federation battle royal at &quot;WrestleMania 2&quot; in Rosemont, Illinois in 1986. In 2006, he returned to the Chicago area to be inducted into the &quot;Celebrity Wing&quot; of the WWE Hall of Fame by John Cena.

In 2003, he appeared in Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dog Eating Contest as a &quot;celebrity contestant&quot;. He stopped eating five minutes into the competition. Also in 2003, he appeared in a TV movie on Comedy Central called &quot;Windy City Heat&quot;, opposite an aspiring actor named Perry Caravello, who is led to believe he is acting in a major motion picture. He also made a short appearance in the opening of &quot;According to Jim&quot; (Season 8, Episode 15).

=== Pop culture ===
In 1987, Hasbro produced an action figure of Perry for their G.I. Joe toy line. The Fridge – William &quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry – was first available in early 1987 as a mail-order offer from Hasbro Direct. He was made available again through 1988, and then again in 1989. The figure had the number 72 emblazoned on his chest (the number Perry wore on his Chicago Bears jersey).

=== Television ===
In 1986, Perry appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot; alongside WWF star Hulk Hogan.

He also appeared on a 2002 episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Man Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
Perry has been married twice and has four children.

In June 2007, Perry was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves. On April 22, 2009, Perry was hospitalized in South Carolina in serious condition from his Guillain–Barré syndrome. Perry spent approximately a month in the hospital before being released. In June 2010, it was reported that Perry suffered from hearing loss, but that he was improving after his diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome. He had lost more than one hundred pounds (45.36 kg), but was, by this time, back up to .

In February 2011, ESPN ran a somber article about Perry, citing ongoing health and drinking problems and a weight of .

In April 2011, Cliff Forrest, a 10-year-old child, discovered Perry&#x27;s Super Bowl ring for sale. With help from his mother he purchased it for $8,500 and returned the ring to Perry. In September 2015, it was reported that Perry&#x27;s Super Bowl ring had been auctioned off for more than $200,000 by the man Perry had sold it to several years earlier.

As of October 29, 2014, Perry was confined to his late father&#x27;s home. Michael Dean Perry, his younger brother and another former NFL defensive lineman, was William&#x27;s guardian and conservator for his affairs. In January 2016, Perry, weighing more than 425 pounds, checked himself into the hospital to receive treatment for diabetes. Confined to a wheelchair, Perry revealed he had no feeling in his feet and was in danger of having his leg amputated. In June 2016, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that Perry was living in a retirement home, had financial difficulties and continued to drink alcohol despite having publicly acknowledged his alcoholism in 2011. However, in 2018, he reported that he was moving around again, and he felt &quot;better than he has in a long time.&quot;

<text>Boggle is a word game introduced in 1972 and in which players try to find as many words as they can from a grid of lettered dice, within a set time limit. It was invented by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers.

==Rules==

One player begins the game by shaking a covered tray of 16 cubic dice, each with a different letter printed on each of its sides. The dice settle into a 4×4 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.

Each player searches for words that fit the following criteria:

* Words must be at least three letters in length.
* Each letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.
* No individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.
* No capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.

Multiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular and plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.

In this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players&#x27; lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player&#x27;s list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.

One cube is printed with &quot;Qu&quot;. This is because &quot;Q&quot; is nearly always followed by &quot;U&quot; in English words (see exceptions), and if there were a &quot;Q&quot; in &quot;Boggle&quot;, it would be challenging to use if a &quot;U&quot; did not, by chance, appear next to it. For the purposes of scoring, &quot;Qu&quot; counts as two letters; for example, &quot;squid&quot; would score two points (for a five-letter word) despite being formed from a chain of only four cubes. Early versions of the game had a &quot;Q&quot; without the accompanying &quot;u&quot;.

Merriam-Webster publishes the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot;, which is also suitable for &quot;Boggle&quot;. This dictionary includes all variant forms of words up to eight letters in length. A puzzle book entitled &quot;100 Boggle Puzzles (Improve Your Game)&quot; offering 100 game positions was published in the UK in 2003 but is no longer in print.

Different versions of &quot;Boggle&quot; have varying distributions of letters. For example, a more modern version in the UK has easier letters, such as only one &quot;K&quot;, but an older version (with a yellow box, from 1986) has two Ks and a generally more awkward letter distribution.

Using the sixteen cubes in a standard &quot;Boggle&quot; set, the list of longest words that can be formed includes &quot;&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, all seventeen-letter words made possible by &quot;q&quot; and &quot;u&quot; appearing on the same face of one cube.

Words within words are allowed, such as &quot;mast&quot; and &quot;aster&quot; within &quot;master&quot;. Neither the cubes nor the board may be touched while the timer is running.

==Game variants==
Parker Brothers has introduced several licensed variations on the game. , only &quot;Boggle Jr.&quot; and &quot;Travel Boggle&quot; (also marketed as &quot;Boggle Folio&quot;) continue to be manufactured and marketed in North America alongside the standard &quot;Boggle&quot; game, apart from a licensed keychain miniature version. &quot;Boggle Jr.&quot; is a much-simplified version intended for young children introduced in 1988. &quot;Boggle Travel&quot; is a version of the standard 4×4 set designed to be traveled. The compact, zippered case includes pencils and small pads of paper, as well as an electronic timer, and notably, a cover made from a soft plastic that produces much less noise when the board is shaken.

&quot;Big Boggle&quot;, later marketed as &quot;Boggle Master&quot; and &quot;Boggle Deluxe&quot;, featured a 5×5 tray, and disallowed three-letter words. Some editions of the &quot;Big Boggle&quot; set included an adapter that could convert the larger grid into a standard 4×4 Boggle grid. In the United Kingdom, Hasbro UK released &quot;Super Boggle&quot; in 2004 (now discontinued), which features both the 4×4 and 5×5 grid and an electronic timer that flashes to indicate the start and finish. Despite the game&#x27;s popularity in North America, no version of &quot;Boggle&quot; offering a 5×5 grid was marketed outside Europe for an extended period until 2011, when Winning Moves Games USA revived the &quot;Big Boggle&quot; name for a new version. Their variant features a two-letter die with popular letter combinations such as Qu, Th and In.

In 2008, Parker Brothers released a self-contained version of the game with the dice sealed inside a plastic unit and featuring an integrated timer. Although the older version has been discontinued, some retailers refer to the newer one as &quot;Boggle Reinvention&quot; to avoid confusion.

In 2012, Winning Moves Games USA released a 6×6 version of the game called &quot;Super Big Boggle&quot;. In addition to the two-letter dice with popular letter combinations, there is also a die containing three faces which are solid squares. These solid squares represent a word stop, which is simply a space that may not be used in any word. The other changes are that the time limit was increased from three minutes to four minutes, three-letter words are no longer allowed, and there is a modified scoring scheme, outlined below.

Other &quot;Boggle&quot; variants have included:

* A version of the standard 4×4 set that included a special red &quot;Boggle challenge cube&quot;, featuring six relatively uncommon letters. Bonus points are awarded for all words making use of the red cube.
* &quot;Boggle&quot; CD-ROM, a version for Windows, produced and marketed by Hasbro Interactive, including both 4×4 and 5×5 versions, several 3-D versions, and facilities allowing up to four players to compete directly over the Internet.
* &quot;Body Boggle&quot;, which is more akin to &quot;Twister&quot; than it is to standard &quot;Boggle&quot;. Two players work together as a team, using their hands and feet to spell words on a large floor mat containing pre-printed &quot;Boggle&quot; letters.
* &quot;Boggle Bowl&quot;, in which players roll their own dice and compete to build longer words, in order to move their token toward their goal on a (bowl-shaped) playing area. Similar to Scrabble, the play area has special spaces, but here they alter the play for the next round.
* A 1998 game show pilot episode hosted by Bill Rafferty that was not picked up for a full production season.
* &quot;Boggle&quot;, an interactive game show hosted by Wink Martindale. It aired on The Family Channel (now ABC Family) in 1994, replacing the interactive version of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;.
* &quot;Coggle&quot;, which functions similarly to &quot;Boggle&quot; but involves creating a word to fit a particular theme. It was mainly marketed in France and Canada.
* &quot;Boggle Flash&quot;. An electronic version of &quot;Boggle&quot;, but consists of five tiles in which one to ten players make words by swapping tiles. This product is sold in the United States under the name &quot;Scrabble Flash&quot;.
* &quot;Foggle&quot;, where the 16 dice have to be used to form valid mathematical equations.

Numerous unofficial computer versions and variants of the game are available. By 1989, users of MIT&#x27;s Project Athena competed in the online game &quot;mboggle&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Ruzzle&quot;, a mobile phone game based on &quot;Boggle&quot;, topped the most-downloaded iPhone apps chart. Other games similar to or influenced by &quot;Boggle&quot; include &quot;Bananagrams&quot;, &quot;Bookworm&quot;, &quot;Dropwords&quot;, &quot;Letterpress&quot;, &quot;Puzzlage&quot;, &quot;SpellTower&quot;, &quot;Word Factory&quot;, &quot;Wordquest&quot;, &quot;Word Racer&quot;, &quot;WordSpot&quot;, &quot;Word Streak with Friends&quot;, &quot;WordTwist&quot;, and &quot;Zip-It&quot;.

Hub Network game show Family Game Night featured a game titled Bounce and Boogie Boggle, which used an electronic 5x5 game. Based on Boggle Reinvention, the main difference is that the letters would be displayed on the stage screen, and the players would have to jump on the letters in order to display their choice. Despite being part of the TV series, this game did not feature on its video game counterpart Hasbro Family Game Night 4: The Game Show.

==Club and tournament play==
While not as widely institutionally established as &quot;Scrabble&quot;, several clubs have been established for the purpose of organizing &quot;Boggle&quot; play. Official &quot;Boggle&quot; clubs exist at a number of educational institutions, including the Dartmouth Union of Bogglers at Dartmouth College, the Western Oregon University Boggle Club, the University of Michigan Boggle Club, Berkeley Boggle Club at the University of California, Berkeley, CCA Boggle Club at Canyon Crest Academy, and Grinnell College Boggle Club.

Unlike &quot;Scrabble&quot;, there is no national or international governing or rule-making body for &quot;Boggle&quot; competition and no official tournament regulations exist. When it comes to creating &quot;Boggle&quot; games for tournament play, most of the time it is done by special software designed to generate completely random and probably fair boards, using words oftentimes pre-selected by the officiating committee.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Boggle&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as a &quot;fast-moving word game&quot;.

<doc id="87202" wikidata="Q663456" url="?curid=87202" title="Coda (file system)">
<text>Coda is a distributed file system developed as a research project at Carnegie Mellon University since 1987 under the direction of Mahadev Satyanarayanan. It descended directly from an older version of Andrew File System (AFS-2) and offers many similar features. The InterMezzo file system was inspired by Coda.

==Features==
Coda has many features that are desirable for network file systems, and several features not found elsewhere.

# Disconnected operation for mobile computing.
# Is freely available under the GPL
# High performance through client-side persistent caching
# Server replication
# Security model for authentication, encryption and access control
# Continued operation during partial network failures in server network
# Network bandwidth adaptation
# Good scalability
# Well defined semantics of sharing, even in the presence of network failure

Coda uses a local cache to provide access to server data when the network connection is lost. During normal operation, a user reads and writes to the file system normally, while the client fetches, or &quot;hoards&quot;, all of the data the user has listed as important in the event of network disconnection. If the network connection is lost, the Coda client&#x27;s local cache serves data from this cache and logs all updates. This operating state is called disconnected operation. Upon network reconnection, the client moves to reintegration state; it sends logged updates to the servers. Then it transitions back to normal connected-mode operation.

Also different from AFS is Coda&#x27;s data replication method. AFS uses a pessimistic replication strategy with its files, only allowing one read/write server to receive updates and all other servers acting as read-only replicas. Coda allows all servers to receive updates, allowing for a greater availability of server data in the event of network partitions, a case which AFS cannot handle.

These unique features introduce the possibility of semantically diverging copies of the same files or directories, known as &quot;conflicts&quot;. Disconnected operation&#x27;s local updates can potentially clash with other connected users&#x27; updates on the same objects, preventing reintegration. Optimistic replication can potentially cause concurrent updates to different servers on the same object, preventing replication. The former case is called a &quot;local/global&quot; conflict, and the latter case a &quot;server/server&quot; conflict. Coda has extensive repair tools, both manual and automated, to handle and repair both types of conflicts.

== Supported platforms ==

Coda has been developed on Linux and support for it appeared in the 2.1 Linux kernel series. It has also been ported to FreeBSD. Subsequently, obsoleted there, an effort is under way to bring it back. Efforts have been made to port Coda to Microsoft Windows, from the Windows 95/Windows 98 era, Windows NT to Windows XP, by means of open-source projects like the DJGCC DOS C Compiler and Cygwin.

<text>Bubalus is a genus of Asiatic bovines that was proposed by Charles Hamilton Smith in 1827. &quot;Bubalus&quot; and &quot;Syncerus&quot; form the subtribe Bubalina, the true buffaloes.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and classification of domestic animals as species, subspecies, races or breeds has been discussed controversially for many years and was inconsistent between authors. Assessors of the Food and Agriculture Organization consider domestic water buffalo populations as breeds.

&quot;Bubalus&quot; species comprise the domestic water buffalo (&quot;B. bubalis&quot;), the wild water buffalo (&quot;B. arnee&quot;), the tamaraw (&quot;B. mindorensis)&quot;, the lowland anoa (&quot;B. depressicornis&quot;), and the mountain anoa (&quot;B. quarlesi&quot;). The latter two anoa species were proposed to form a subgenus &quot;Anoa&quot; within &quot;Bubalus&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Smith described &quot;Bubalus&quot; as low in proportion to the bulk with very solid limbs, a small dewlap and a long, slender tail; the head is large with a strong convex-shaped narrow forehead, large eyes and funnel-shaped ears; horns are lying flat or bending laterally with a certain direction to the rear; the female udder has four mammae. Lydekker added that the line of back is nearly straight with 13 pairs of ribs; the tail is tufted and reaching about to the hocks; the horns are more or less markedly triangular for the greater part of their length and situated low down on the skull; the muzzle is broad, and the hair sparse in adults.

==Species==
This genus comprises the following living species:
===Valid names===
The 2013 checklist of the Catalogue of Life lists as &quot;accepted&quot; five species binomina in the genus &quot;Bubalus&quot;:
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus depressicornis&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus mephistopheles&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus mindorensis&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus quarlesi&quot; 
&quot;Bubalus arnee&quot; is not listed here.

The Integrated Taxonomic Information System lists the same five species binomina as valid; it also lists as valid six subspecies of &quot;Bubalus bubalis&quot;:
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis arnee&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis bubalis&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis fulvus&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis kerabau&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis migona&quot; 
* &quot;Bubalus bubalis theerapati&quot; 

=== Fossil species ===
The following extinct fossil species have been described:

*&quot;Bubalus brevicornis&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus cebuensis&quot; (Cebu tamaraw) - 
*&quot;Bubalus fudi&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus grovesi&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus mephistopheles&quot; (Short-horned water buffalo) - 
*&quot;Bubalus murrensis&quot; (European water buffalo) - 
*&quot;Bubalus palaeokerabau&quot; (Long-horned Javan water buffalo) - 
*&quot;Bubalus platyceros&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus teilhardi&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus wansijocki&quot; - 
*&quot;Bubalus youngi&quot; -

<doc id="87208" wikidata="Q216169" url="?curid=87208" title="Execution by firing squad">
<text>Execution by firing squad, in the past sometimes called fusillading (from the French , rifle), is a method of capital punishment, particularly common in the military and in times of war. Some reasons for its use are that firearms are usually readily available and a gunshot to a vital organ, such as the brain or heart, most often will kill relatively quickly.

A firing squad is normally composed of at least several soldiers, all of whom are usually instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by one member and identification of who fired the lethal shot. To avoid disfigurement due to multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the heart, sometimes aided by a paper or cloth target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded as well as restrained. Executions can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at first light or at sunrise, giving rise to the phrase &quot;shot at dawn&quot;.

Execution by firing squad is a specific practice that is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an execution by shot(s) to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot to the brain by the squad&#x27;s officer with a pistol at point blank (coup de grâce) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal. Before the introduction of firearms, bows or crossbows were often used—Saint Sebastian is usually depicted as executed by a squad of Roman auxiliary archers in around AD 288; King Edmund the Martyr of East Anglia, by some accounts, was tied to a tree and executed by Viking archers on 20 November 869 or 870.
==Military significance==


The method is often the capital punishment or disciplinary means employed by military courts for crimes such as cowardice, desertion, espionage, murder, mutiny, or treason.

If the condemned prisoner is an ex-officer who is acknowledged to have shown bravery throughout their career, they may be afforded the privilege of giving the order to fire. Cases of this are the executions of Marshals Michel Ney and Joachim Murat. As a means of insulting the condemned, however, past executions have had them shot in the back, denied blindfolds, or even tied to chairs. When Galeazzo Ciano, son-in-law of Benito Mussolini, and several other former fascists who voted to remove Mussolini from power were executed, they were tied to chairs facing away from their executioners. By some reports, Ciano managed to twist his chair around at the last second to face them, but this is unconfirmed.

==Blank cartridge==
Sometimes, one or more soldiers of the firing squad may be issued a rifle containing a blank cartridge. In such cases, soldiers of the firing squad are not told beforehand whether they are using live or blank ammunition. This is believed to reinforce the sense of diffusion of responsibility among the firing squad members. It provides each member with a measure of plausible deniability that they, personally, did not fire a bullet at all. In practice however, firing a live round produces significant recoil, while firing a blank round does not. In more current times such as during the 2010 execution of Ronnie Lee Gardner in Utah, US, one rifleman may be given a &quot;dummy&quot; cartridge containing a wax bullet, which provides a more realistic recoil.

==By country==
===Argentina===
Manuel Dorrego, a prominent Argentine statesman and soldier who governed Buenos Aires in the 1820s, was executed by firing squad on 12 December 1828 after being defeated in battle by Juan Lavalle and later convicted of treason.

===Belgium===

On 12 October 1915 British nurse Edith Cavell was executed by a German firing squad at the Tir national shooting range at Schaerbeek, after being convicted of &quot;conveying troops to the enemy&quot; during the First World War.

On 1 April 1916 a Belgian woman, Gabrielle Petit, was executed by a German firing squad at Schaerbeek after being convicted of spying for the British Secret Service during World War I.

During the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, three captured German spies were tried and executed by a U.S. firing squad at Henri-Chapelle on 23 December 1944. Thirteen other Germans were also tried and shot at either Henri-Chapelle or Huy. These executed spies took part in Waffen-SS commando Otto Skorzeny&#x27;s Operation Greif, in which English-speaking German commandos operated behind U.S. lines, masquerading in U.S. uniforms and equipment.

===Brazil===

The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 expressly prohibits the usage of capital punishment in peacetime, but authorizes the use of the death penalty for military crimes committed during wartime. War must be declared formally, in accordance with international law and article 84, item 19 of the Federal Constitution, with due authorization from the Brazilian Congress. The Brazilian Code of Military Penal Law, in its chapter dealing with wartime offences, specifies the crimes that are subject to the death penalty. The death penalty is never the only possible sentence for a crime, and the punishment must be imposed by the military courts system. Per the norms of the Brazilian Code of Military Penal Procedure, the death penalty is carried out by firing squad.

Although Brazil still permits the use of capital punishment during wartime, no convicts were actually executed during Brazil&#x27;s last military conflict, the Second World War. The military personnel sentenced to death during World War II had their sentences reduced by the President of the Republic.

===Chile===
Following the military overthrow of the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende in 1973, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet initiated a series of war tribunal trials against leftist people around the country. During the first months after his coup, hundreds of people were killed by firing squads and summary executions.

===Cuba===
Cuba, as part of its penal system, still utilizes death by firing squad, although the last recorded execution was in 2003. In January 1992 a Cuban exile convicted of &quot;terrorism, sabotage and enemy propaganda&quot; was executed by firing squad. The Council of the State noted that the punishment served as a deterrent and stated that the death penalty &quot;fulfills a goal of overall prevention, especially when the idea is to stop such loathsome actions from being repeated, to deter others and so to prevent innocent human lives from being endangered in the future&quot;.

During the months following the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, soldiers of the Batista government and political opponents to the revolution were executed by firing squad.

===Finland===
The death penalty was widely used during and after the Finnish Civil War (January–May 1918); some 9,700 Finns and an unknown number of Russian volunteers on the Red side were executed during the war or in its aftermath. Most executions were carried out by firing squads after the sentences were given by illegal or semi-legal courts martial. Only some 250 persons were sentenced to death in courts acting on legal authority.

During World War II some 500 persons were executed, half of them condemned spies. The usual causes for death penalty for Finnish citizens were treason and high treason (and to a lesser extent cowardice and disobedience, applicable for military personnel). Almost all cases of capital punishment were tried by court-martial. Usually the executions were carried out by the regimental military police platoon, or by the local military police in the case of spies. One Finn, Toivo Koljonen, was executed for a civilian crime (six murders). Most executions occurred in 1941 and during the Soviet Summer Offensive in 1944. The last death sentences were given in 1945 for murder, but later commuted to life imprisonment.

The death penalty was abolished by Finnish law in 1949 for crimes committed during peacetime, and in 1972 for all crimes. Finland is party to the Optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, forbidding the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.

===France===

Pte. Thomas Highgate was the first British soldier to be convicted of desertion and executed by firing squad in September 1914 at Tournan-en-Brie during World War I. In October 1916 Pte. Harry Farr was shot for cowardice at Carnoy, which was later suspected to be acoustic shock. Highgate and Farr, along with 304 other British and Imperial troops who were executed for similar offenses, were listed at the Shot at Dawn Memorial which was erected to honor them.

On 15 October 1917 Dutch exotic dancer Mata Hari was executed by a French firing squad at Château de Vincennes castle in the town of Vincennes after being convicted of spying for Germany during World War I.

During World War II, on 24 September 1944, Josef Wende and Stephan Kortas, two Poles drafted into the German army, crossed the Moselle Rivers behind U.S. lines in civilian clothes to observe Allied strength and were to rejoin their own army on the same day. However, they were discovered by the Americans and arrested. On 18 October 1944 they were found guilty of espionage by a U.S. military commission and sentenced to death. On 11 November 1944 they were shot in the garden of a farmhouse at Toul. The footage of Wende&#x27;s execution as well as Kortas&#x27;s is shown in these links.

On 31 January 1945, U.S. Army Pvt. Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Slovik was executed by firing squad for desertion near the village of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. He was the first American soldier executed for such offense since the American Civil War.

On 15 October 1945 Pierre Laval, the puppet leader of Nazi-occupied Vichy France, was executed for treason at Fresnes Prison in Paris.

On 11 March 1963 Jean Bastien-Thiry was the last person to be executed by firing squad for a failed attempt to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle.

===Indonesia===

Execution by firing squad is the capital punishment method used in Indonesia. The following persons were executed (reported by BBC World Service) by firing squad on 29 April 2015 following convictions for drug offences: two Australians, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, the Ghanaian Martin Anderson, the Indonesian Zainal Abidin bin Mgs Mahmud Badarudin, three Nigerians: Raheem Agbaje Salami, Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise and Okwudili Oyatanze, as well as Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte.

In 2006 Fabianus Tibo, Dominggus da Silva and Marinus Riwu were executed. Nigerian drug smugglers Samuel Iwachekwu Okoye and Hansen Anthoni Nwaolisa were executed in June 2008 in Nusakambangan Island. Five months later three men convicted for the 2002 Bali bombing—Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Ali Ghufron—were executed on the same spot in Nusakambangan. In January 2013 56-year-old British woman Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to execution by firing squad for importing a large amount of cocaine; she lost her appeal against her sentence in April 2013. On 18 January 2015, under the new leadership of Joko Widodo, six people sentenced to death for producing and smuggling drugs into Indonesia were executed at Nusa Kambangan Penitentiary shortly after midnight.

===Ireland===

Following the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, 15 of the 16 leaders who were executed were shot by the Dublin Castle administration under martial law. The executions have often been cited as a reason for how the Rising managed to galvanise public support in Ireland after the failed rebellion.

Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, a split in the government and the Dáil led to a Civil War during which the Free State Government sanctioned the executions by firing squad of 81 persons. Included in those numbers were some prominent prisoners who were executed without trial as reprisals.

===Italy===

Italy had used the firing squad as its only form of death penalty, both for civilians and military, since the unification of the country in 1861. The death penalty was abolished completely by both Italian Houses of Parliament in 1889 but revived under the Italian dictatorship of Benito Mussolini in 1926. Mussolini was himself shot in the last days of World War II.

On 1 December 1945 Anton Dostler, the first German general to be tried for war crimes, was executed by a U.S. firing squad in Aversa after being found guilty by a U.S. military tribunal of ordering the killing of 15 U.S. prisoners of war in Italy during World War II.

The last execution took place on 4 March 1947, as Francesco La Barbera, Giovanni Puleo and Giovanni D&#x27;Ignoti, sentenced to death on multiple accounts of robbery and murder, faced the firing squad at the range of Basse di Stura, near Turin. Soon after the Constitution of the newly proclaimed Republic prohibited the death penalty except for some crimes, like high treason, during wartime; no one was sentenced to death after 1947. In 2007 the Constitution was amended to ban the death penalty altogether.

===Malta===

Firing squads were used during the periods of French and British control in Malta. Ringleaders of rebellions were often shot dead by firing squad during the French period, with perhaps the most notable examples being Dun Mikiel Xerri and other patriots in 1799.

The British also used the practice briefly, and for the last time in 1813, when two men were shot separately outside the courthouse after being convicted of failing to report their infection of plague to the authorities.

===Mexico===
During the Mexican Independence War, several Independentist generals (such as Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos) were executed by Spanish firing squads. Also, Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and two of his generals were executed in the Cerro de las Campanas after the Juaristas took control of Mexico in 1867. Manet immortalized the execution in a now-famous painting, &quot;The Execution of Emperor Maximilian&quot;; he painted at least three versions.

Firing-squad execution was the most common way to carry out a death sentence in Mexico, especially during the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero War. An example of that is in the attempted execution of Wenseslao Moguel, who survived being shot ten times—once at point-blank range—because he fought under Pancho Villa. After these events, the death sentence was imposed for fewer types of crimes in Article 22 of the Mexican Constitution; however, in 2005 capital punishment was constitutionally prohibited, and there has not been a judicial execution since 1961.

===Netherlands===

During the Nazi occupation in World War II some 3,000 persons were executed by German firing squads. The victims were sometimes sentenced by a military court; in other cases they were hostages or arbitrary pedestrians who were executed publicly to intimidate the population. After the attack on high-ranking German officer Hanns Albin Rauter, about 300 people were executed publicly as reprisal against resistance movements. Rauter himself was executed near Scheveningen on 12 January 1949, following his conviction for war crimes. Anton Mussert, a Dutch Nazi leader, was sentenced to death by firing squad and executed in the dunes near The Hague on 7 May 1946.

While under Allied guard in Amsterdam, and five days after the capitulation of Nazi Germany, two German Navy deserters were shot by a firing squad composed of other German prisoners kept in the Canadian-run prisoner-of-war camp. The men were lined up against the wall of an air raid shelter near an abandoned Ford Motor Company assembly plant in the presence of Canadian military.

===Nigeria===
Nigeria executes criminals who committed armed robberies—such as Ishola Oyenusi, Lawrence Anini and Osisikankwu—as well as military officers convicted of plotting coups against the government, such as Buka Suka Dimka and Maj. Gideon Orkar, by firing squad.

===Norway===

Vidkun Quisling, the leader of the collaborationist Nasjonal Samling Party and president of Norway during the German occupation in World War II, was sentenced to death for treason and executed by firing squad on 24 October 1945 at the Akershus Fortress.

===Philippines===


Jose Rizal was executed by firing squad on the morning of 30 December 1896, in what is now Rizal Park, where his remains have since been placed.

While in [Cavite] there were 13 people who executed by firing squad. They are known today as 13 martyrs of Cavite.

During the Marcos administration, drug trafficking was punishable by firing-squad execution, as was done to Lim Seng. Execution by firing squad was later replaced by the electric chair, then lethal injection. On 24 June 2006, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo abolished capital punishment through the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346. Existing death row inmates, who numbered in the thousands, were eventually given life sentences or reclusion perpetua instead.

===Romania===
Nicolae Ceaușescu was executed by firing squad alongside his wife while singing the Communist Internationale following a show trial, bringing an end to the Romanian Revolution, on Christmas Day, 1989.

===Russia/USSR===
In Imperial Russia, firing squads were used in the army for executions during combat on the orders of military tribunals.

In the Soviet Union, from the very earliest days, the bullet to the back of the head, in front of a ready-dug burial trench was by far the most common practice. It became especially widely used during the Great Purge.

===Saudi Arabia===
Executions in Saudi Arabia are usually carried out by beheading; however, at times other methods have been used. Al-Beshi, a Saudi executioner, has said that he has conducted some executions by shooting. Mishaal bint Fahd bin Mohammed Al Saud, a Saudi princess, was also executed in the same way.

===South Africa===
Two soldiers of the Bushveldt Carbineers, Breaker Morant and Peter Handcock, were executed by a British firing squad in the South African Republic on 27 February 1902 for war crimes they committed during the Second Boer War.

=== Spain ===

Since the Spanish transition to democracy in 1977 the new Spanish constitution prohibits the death penalty. Previously, execution by firing squad was reserved for cases under military jurisdiction. As in the rest of Europe, the death penalty ordered by a civil court was carried out by other methods clearly different from execution. In modern times, mainly by hanging or garrote.

During the decolonization of the Americas, several heroes of the independence of the former viceroyalties were executed by firing squad, including Camilo Torres Tenorio, Antonio Baraya, Antonio Villavicencio, José María Carbonell, Francisco José de Caldas, Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Policarpa Salavarrieta, María Antonia Santos Plata, José María Morelos, Mariano Matamoros, etc.

At the time of the Spanish Civil War the phrase &quot;¡Al paredón!&quot; (&quot;To the wall!&quot;) to express the death threat to whom certain blame is attributed to be summarily executed. &quot;Dar un paseo&quot; (Going for a walk) is the euphemism of a series of violent episodes and political repression that occurred during the Spanish Civil War, which took place on both the Republican and the Nationalist factions, looking for victims with the excuse of taking them for a walk, which ended with the shooting in the open fields, often at night. It was an abbreviated murder procedure in the form of the &quot;Ley de fugas&quot; (Law for escapes). Sometimes common criminals participated in them.

Indalecio Prieto would define these executions in &quot;Letters to a sculptor: small details of great events&quot; as:&quot;Executions without summary that were carried out in both areas of Spain and that dishonored us Spaniards on both sides equally&quot;.The last use of capital punishment in Spain took place on 27 September 1975 by firing squads for two members of the armed Basque nationalist and separatist group ETA political-military and three members of the Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP).

===United Arab Emirates===

In the United Arab Emirates, firing squad is the preferred method of execution.

===United Kingdom===

The standard method of execution in the United Kingdom was hanging. Execution by firing squad was limited to times of war, armed insurrection and in the military, although it is now outlawed in all circumstances, along with all other forms of capital punishment.

The Tower of London was used during both World Wars for executions. During World War I, eleven captured German spies were shot between 1914 and 1916: nine on the Tower&#x27;s rifle range and two in the Tower Ditch, all of whom were buried in East London Cemetery, in Plaistow, London. On 15 August 1941, the last execution at the Tower was that of German Cpl. Josef Jakobs, shot for espionage during World War II.

Since the 1960s, there has been some controversy concerning the 346 British and Imperial troops—including 25 Canadians, 22 Irish and 5 New Zealanders—shot for desertion, murder, cowardice and other offences during World War I, some of whom are now thought to have been suffering from combat stress reaction or post-traumatic stress disorder (&quot;shell-shock&quot;, as it was then known). This led to organisations such as the Shot at Dawn Campaign being set up in later years to try to uncover just why these soldiers were executed. The Shot at Dawn Memorial was erected at Staffordshire to honour these soldiers. In August 2006 it was announced that 306 of these soldiers would receive posthumous pardons.

===United States===


During the American War of Independence, General George Washington approved a sentence of death by firing squad, but the prisoner was later pardoned.

During the American Civil War, 433 of the 573 men executed were shot dead by a firing squad: 186 of the 267 executed by the Union Army, and 247 of the 306 executed by the Confederate Army.

The United States Army carried out 10 executions by firing squad during World War II from 1942 to 1945.

The United States Army took over Shepton Mallet prison in Somerset, U.K. in 1942, renaming it Disciplinary Training Center No.1 and housing troops convicted of offences across Europe. There were eighteen executions at the prison, two of them by firing squad for murder: U.S. Army Pvt. Alexander Miranda on 30 May 1944 and Pvt. Benjamin Pygate on 28 November 1944. Locals complained about the noise, as the executions took place in the prison yard at 1:00am.

In 1913, Andriza Mircovich became the first and only inmate in Nevada to be executed by shooting. After the warden of Nevada State Prison could not find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was built to carry out Mircovich&#x27;s execution.

John W. Deering allowed an electrocardiogram recording of the effect of gunshot wounds on his heart during his 1938 execution by firing squad, and afterwards his body was donated to the University of Utah School of Medicine, at his request.

Since 1960 there have been four executions by firing squad, all in Utah: The 1960 execution of James W. Rodgers, Gary Gilmore&#x27;s execution in 1977, and John Albert Taylor in 1996, who chose a firing squad for his execution, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;to make a statement that Utah was sanctioning murder&quot;. However, a 2010 article for the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; quotes Taylor justifying his choice because he did not want to &quot;flop around like a dying fish&quot; during a lethal injection. Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad in 2010, having said he preferred this method of execution because of his &quot;Mormon heritage&quot;. Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad, in opposition to popular opinion in Utah, because of concern over the state&#x27;s image in the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Execution by firing squad was banned in Utah in 2004, but as the ban was not retroactive, three inmates on Utah&#x27;s death row have the firing squad set as their method of execution. Idaho banned execution by firing squad in 2009, temporarily leaving Oklahoma as the only state utilizing this method of execution (and only as a secondary method).

Reluctance by drug companies to see their drugs used to kill people has led to a shortage of the commonly used lethal injection drugs. In March 2015, Utah enacted legislation allowing for execution by firing squad if the drugs they use are unavailable. Several other states are also exploring a return to the firing squad. Thus, after waning in both use and popularity in recent decades, as of 2022, firing squad executions appear to be at least anecdotally regaining popularity as an alternative to lethal injection.

On January 30, 2019, South Carolina&#x27;s Senate voted 26–13 in favor of a revived proposal to bring back the electric chair and add firing squads to its execution options. On May 14, 2021, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster signed a bill into law which brought back the electric chair as the default method of execution (in the event lethal injection was unavailable) and added the firing squad to the list of execution options. South Carolina had not performed executions in over a decade, and its lethal injection drugs expired in 2013. Pharmaceutical companies have since refused to sell drugs for lethal injection.

On April 7, 2022, the South Carolina Supreme Court scheduled the execution of Richard Bernard Moore for April 29, 2022. On April 15, 2022, Moore chose to be executed by firing squad instead of the electric chair, however, his execution was later stayed by the South Carolina Supreme Court, and was executed on November 1, 2024 by lethal injection.

On February 7, 2025, the South Carolina Supreme Court scheduled the execution of Brad Sigmon for March 7, 2025. He was given the choice to die by lethal injection, firing squad, or electrocution, the latter of which his lawyers stated he did not want to die from. Due to concerns about the lethal injection doses, on February 21, 2025, Sigmon chose to die by firing squad. If executed, he will be the first person executed by firing squad in nearly 15 years since Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010.

As of 2024, Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Utah use the firing squad for the death penalty. In 2023, The Tennessee legislature debated about using the firing squad as a means of execution.
 On March 20, 2023, the bill passed the Idaho state legislature, and was signed by the governor.

<text>A sigmoid function is any mathematical function whose graph has a characteristic S-shaped or sigmoid curve.

A common example of a sigmoid function is the logistic function, which is defined by the formula:
:formula_1

Other sigmoid functions are given in the Examples section. In some fields, most notably in the context of artificial neural networks, the term &quot;sigmoid function&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;logistic function&quot;.

Special cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve (used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x) and the ogee curve (used in the spillway of some dams). Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers, with return (response) value commonly monotonically increasing but could be decreasing. Sigmoid functions most often show a return value (y axis) in the range 0 to 1. Another commonly used range is from −1 to 1.

A wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions (which go from 0 to 1), such as the integrals of the logistic density, the normal density, and Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot; probability density functions. The logistic sigmoid function is invertible, and its inverse is the logit function.

== Definition ==
A sigmoid function is a bounded, differentiable, real function that is defined for all real input values and has a non-negative derivative at each point and exactly one inflection point.
== Properties ==
In general, a sigmoid function is monotonic, and has a first derivative which is bell shaped. Conversely, the integral of any continuous, non-negative, bell-shaped function (with one local maximum and no local minimum, unless degenerate) will be sigmoidal. Thus the cumulative distribution functions for many common probability distributions are sigmoidal. One such example is the error function, which is related to the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution; another is the arctan function, which is related to the cumulative distribution function of a Cauchy distribution.

A sigmoid function is constrained by a pair of horizontal asymptotes as formula_2.

A sigmoid function is convex for values less than a particular point, and it is concave for values greater than that point: in many of the examples here, that point is 0.

== Examples ==
* Logistic function formula_3
* Hyperbolic tangent (shifted and scaled version of the logistic function, above) formula_4
* Arctangent function formula_5
* Gudermannian function formula_6
* Error function formula_7
* Generalised logistic function formula_8
* Smoothstep function formula_9
* Some algebraic functions, for example formula_10
* and in a more general form formula_11
* Up to shifts and scaling, many sigmoids are special cases of formula_12 where formula_13 is the inverse of the negative Box–Cox transformation, and formula_14 and formula_15 are shape parameters.
* Smooth transition function normalized to (-1,1):

formula_16 using the hyperbolic tangent mentioned above. Here, formula_17 is a free parameter encoding the slope at formula_18, which must be greater than or equal to formula_19 because any smaller value will result in a function with multiple inflection points, which is therefore not a true sigmoid. This function is unusual because it actually attains the limiting values of -1 and 1 within a finite range, meaning that its value is constant at -1 for all formula_20 and at 1 for all formula_21. Nonetheless, it is smooth (infinitely differentiable, formula_22) &quot;everywhere&quot;, including at formula_23.

== Applications ==
Many natural processes, such as those of complex system learning curves, exhibit a progression from small beginnings that accelerates and approaches a climax over time. When a specific mathematical model is lacking, a sigmoid function is often used.

The van Genuchten–Gupta model is based on an inverted S-curve and applied to the response of crop yield to soil salinity.

Examples of the application of the logistic S-curve to the response of crop yield (wheat) to both the soil salinity and depth to water table in the soil are shown in modeling crop response in agriculture.

In artificial neural networks, sometimes non-smooth functions are used instead for efficiency; these are known as hard sigmoids.

In audio signal processing, sigmoid functions are used as waveshaper transfer functions to emulate the sound of analog circuitry clipping.

In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill and Hill–Langmuir equations are sigmoid functions.

In computer graphics and real-time rendering, some of the sigmoid functions are used to blend colors or geometry between two values, smoothly and without visible seams or discontinuities.

Titration curves between strong acids and strong bases have a sigmoid shape due to the logarithmic nature of the pH scale.

The logistic function can be calculated efficiently by utilizing type III Unums.

An hierarchy of sigmoid growth models with increasing complexity (number of parameters) was built with the primary goal to re-analyze kinetic data, the so called N-t curves, from heterogeneous nucleation experiments, in electrochemistry. The hierarchy includes at present three models, with 1, 2 and 3 parameters, if not counting the maximal number of nuclei Nmax, respectively—a tanh2 based model called α21 originally devised to describe diffusion-limited crystal growth (not aggregation!) in 2D, the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAKn) model, and the Richards model. It was shown that for the concrete purpose even the simplest model works and thus it was implied that the experiments revisited are an example of two-step nucleation with the first step being the growth of the metastable phase in which the nuclei of the stable phase form.

<doc id="87216" wikidata="Q6562703" url="?curid=87216" title="List of VFL/AFL premiers">
<text>This page is a complete chronological listing of VFL/AFL premiers. The Australian Football League (AFL), known as the Victorian Football League (VFL) until 1989, is the elite national competition in men&#x27;s Australian rules football.

The inaugural premiership was awarded as a result of a round-robin finals system; this format was replaced after the first season, and a grand final has been held every season since 1898 to determine the premiers, with the exception of 1924 when a modified round-robin system was used. The formation of a national competition, beginning in 1987, has resulted in the league attempting to develop &quot;an even and stable competition&quot; through a range of equalisation policies, such as a salary cap and draft (introduced in 1985 and 1986, respectively). This has had a significant impact on the spread of premierships: since 1990, thirteen clubs have won a premiership, compared with only five clubs between 1967 and 1989.

Three clubs, , and , have won the most VFL/AFL premierships, with 16 each. All teams currently competing in the AFL except , and (three of the four newest clubs) have won a premiership, and all except have played in a grand final.

==List of premiers==


==Premierships by club==

==Minor grade premierships==
In addition to the seniors, VFL/AFL clubs have competed in premierships in three minor grades.

===Night premierships===

The pre-season and night premiership covers three competitions which are considered historically equivalent in status:
* VFL night series, a consolation competition played amongst non-finalists between 1956 and 1971, and again in 1977, 1978 and 1987.
* Australian Football Championships night series, a mid-season knock-out competition played concurrently with the premiership and involving teams from interstate, played between 1979 and 1986.
* VFL/AFL pre-season competition, played before each season from 1988 until 2013.

===Seconds/reserves premierships===

The reserve grade premiership was held in various formats between 1919 and 1999. It was known as the Victorian Junior Football League from 1919 until 1923, the Seconds from 1924 until 1959, the VFL Reserves from 1960 until 1989, and as the AFL reserves from 1990 until 1999. Until 1991, the competition was run by the VFL/AFL, and from 1992 until 1999 it was administered by the Victorian State Football League.

===Thirds/under-19s premierships===
The VFL/AFL under-19s competition was held between 1946 and 1991. It was known as the VFL thirds from 1946 until 1959, and as the under-19s from 1960 until 1991.

<text>Levardis Robert Martyn Burton Jr. (born February 16, 1957) is an American actor, director, and television host. He played Geordi La Forge in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994), Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; (1977), and was the host of the PBS Kids educational television series &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; for 23 years (1983–2006). Burton received 12 Daytime Emmy Awards and a Peabody Award as host and executive producer of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;.

His other roles include Cap Jackson in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977), Donald Lang in &quot;Dummy&quot; (1979), Tommy Price in &quot;The Hunter&quot; (1980), which earned him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, and Martin Luther King Jr. in &quot;Ali&quot; (2001). Burton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards for his narration of the book &quot;The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; In 1990, he was honored for his accomplishments in television with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

From 2017 until 2024, Burton created and hosted the podcast &quot;LeVar Burton Reads&quot;, often described as &quot;&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; for adults&quot;. In October 2024, Burton appeared as the host of the Trivial Pursuit television game show broadcast on The CW network and streaming online.

==Early life==
Burton was born in Landstuhl, West Germany. His mother, Erma Gene (née Christian), was a social worker, administrator, and educator. Burton and his two sisters were raised by his mother in Sacramento, California, United States.

Burton&#x27;s father, also named LeVar, was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps stationed at Landstuhl at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. His paternal grandparents were both educators in rural Arkansas. His great-great grandfather, Hal B. Burton, was an African-American state legislator in Arkansas after the Reconstruction era that enfranchised African Americans in the South after the American Civil War; he was elected to represent Jefferson County in 1887.

As a teen, Burton, who was raised Catholic, entered St. Pius X Minor Seminary in Galt, California, intending to become a priest. At the age of 17, questioning the Catholic faith, he changed his vocation to acting; at the age of 19, while an undergraduate at the University of Southern California, he won a starring role in the 1977 television miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work===
Burton made his acting debut in 1976 with &quot;Almos&#x27; a Man&quot;, a film based on the Richard Wright short story &quot;The Man Who Was Almost a Man&quot;, in which Burton stars alongside Madge Sinclair.

===&quot;Roots&quot;===

Burton&#x27;s breakthrough role was as the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; (1977), based on the by Alex Haley. Burton has described his first day playing Kunta as the start of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in a Drama or Comedy Series category.

He reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film &quot;&quot;. When asked about the societal influence of &quot;Roots&quot;, Burton is quoted as saying: &quot;It expanded the consciousness of people. Blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. And if you throw a pebble into the pond, you&#x27;re going to get ripples. I think the only constant is change, and it&#x27;s always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation. &quot;Roots&quot; is part of a changing trend, and it&#x27;s still being played out.&quot;

===&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;===

Burton was the host and executive producer of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons.

After &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children. &quot; Reading Rainbow&quot; was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; brand.

On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised more than $5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days.

In 2017, Burton was sued by the public broadcasting company WNED-TV for alleged copyright infringement for use of the Reading Rainbow brand in marketing the new iPad app and other online media. RRKIDZ later became known as LeVar Burton Kids and the iPad app, Skybrary.

===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
In 1986, Gene Roddenberry approached Burton with the role of Lieutenant Junior Grade Geordi La Forge in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; television series. The character is blind but is granted &quot;sight&quot; through the use of a prosthetic device called a VISOR worn over his eyes. La Forge began as the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s helmsman, and as of the show&#x27;s second season, had become its chief engineer. At the time, Burton was considerably better known than Patrick Stewart in the United States, due to his roles in &quot;Roots&quot; and &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;. When the show premiered, the Associated Press stated that Burton&#x27;s role was essentially the &quot;new Spock&quot;. In a 2019 interview, Burton laughed in disbelief at the idea, stating &quot;that speculation never came to fruition.&quot; Burton also portrayed La Forge in the subsequent feature films based on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, from &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994) to &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002). He directed two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. He reprised the role of LaForge in the third and final season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023).

=== Podcast: &quot;LeVar Burton Reads&quot; ===
In 2017, Burton began a podcast, &quot;LeVar Burton Reads&quot;. Each 30-45-minute episode features Burton reading a piece of short fiction and sharing his thoughts on it. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he continued to read on his podcast and also gave live readings three times a week during a Twitter livestream focused at different times to different children, young adults, and adult audiences.

In reviews, the podcast is often described as &quot;&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; for adults&quot;. Since its launch, &quot;LeVar Burton Reads&quot; has won favorable reviews, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and elsewhere and numerous awards, including the 2023 Webby Award for Best Art and Culture Podcast. Burton&#x27;s five-word Webby acceptance speech was: &quot;Be a better person. Read.&quot;

In 2023, Burton launched a second podcast, this time for children, called &quot;Sound Detectives&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Burton played a role as a visitor to &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, guest star on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, was a participant in &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;, a guest of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;″s televised premiere party for the release of &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, and a frequent guest on several game shows.

In 1986, he appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Word Up!&quot; by the funk/R&amp;B group Cameo.

In 1987, Burton played Dave Robinson, a journalist (sports writer), in the third season of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, episode 16 – &quot;Death Takes a Dive&quot;, starring Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher.

Burton accepted an invitation to host &quot;Rebop&quot;, a multicultural series designed for young people aged 9–15, produced by WGBH for PBS.

On television, Burton has helped dramatize the last days of Jim Jones&#x27;s suicide cult in Guyana, the life and times of Jesse Owens, and the life of the nine-year-old Booker T. Washington. He portrayed Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2001 film &quot;Ali&quot;. He also portrayed Detroit Tiger Ron LeFlore in the television movie &quot;One in a Million, The Ron LeFlore Story&quot;.

In 1992, a clip of Burton&#x27;s voice was sampled by DC Talk for the track &quot;Time is...&quot; on their album &quot;Free at Last&quot;. The sample is at the very end of the song, in which Burton can be heard saying: &quot;Whoa, wait a minute.&quot; He has also lent his voice to several animated projects, including Kwame in the cartoon series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; (1990–1993) and &quot;The New Adventures of Captain Planet&quot; (1993–1996), &quot;Our Friend, Martin&quot; (1999), &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. Burton is on the audio version of books such as &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963&quot; by Christopher Paul Curtis. Burton has been cast as voice actor for Black Lightning in &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot; DVD.

Burton appeared several times as a celebrity guest on the Dick Clark-hosted &quot;$25,000 and $100,000 Pyramids&quot;, from 1982 until 1988. Burton also was the strongest link in the special &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. He defeated his final opponent Robert Picardo and won $167,500 for his charity, Junior Achievement of Southern California, a record for the show at that time and the largest amount won in any Celebrity Edition of the show (it was later surpassed by a $188,500 win in a &quot;Tournament of Losers&quot; episode).

He has made appearances in such sitcoms as &quot;Becker&quot;.
Burton is the host and executive producer of a documentary titled &quot;The Science of Peace&quot;, which was in production as of 2007. It investigates the science and technology aimed at enabling world peace, sometimes called peace science. The film explores some of the concepts of shared noetic consciousness, having been sponsored in part by the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

He appeared in an April Fool&#x27;s episode of &quot;Smosh&quot; pretending to have taken over the channel and making various edits at popular Smosh videos.

He makes occasional appearances on &quot;This Week in Tech&quot;, where he is a self-proclaimed &quot;nerd&quot;, and also participated in the Consumer Electronics Show 2010.

In 2010, Burton made an appearance on &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; as the ghost of himself in the episode &quot;Greene Machine&quot;. In February 2011, he made an appearance as himself on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Community&quot; in the episode &quot;Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking&quot;, and then again in January 2014&#x27;s &quot;Geothermal Escapism&quot;.

Burton has appeared as a fictionalized, humorous version of himself on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, first appearing in the episode &quot;The Toast Derivation&quot;, in which he almost attends a party thrown by Sheldon (before swearing off Twitter), in November 2012 in the episode &quot;The Habitation Configuration&quot;, in which he appears on &quot;Fun With Flags&quot; in exchange for lunch and gas money, and again in the November 2014 episode &quot;The Champagne Reflection&quot;, in which he returns for the 232nd episode of &quot;Fun With Flags&quot; in exchange for Sheldon deleting his contact details.

In 2012, he had a recurring role as dean Paul Haley on the TNT series &quot;Perception&quot;. For the second season (2013), he became part of the regular cast.

In 2014, he had a guest appearance in an introduction section for the 200th episode of Achievement Hunter&#x27;s show, &quot;Achievement Hunter Weekly Update&quot; (AHWU). In May 2014, he appeared as a guest on the YouTube channel &quot;SciShow&quot;, explaining the science behind double, tertiary, and quaternary rainbows. Late in 2014, he had another guest appearance on a 24-hour Extra Life, a fundraising organization for Children&#x27;s Miracle Network hospitals, stream by Rooster Teeth. Burton has also taped a recycling field trip for YouTube.

In November 2020, he appeared as himself on &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;. His segment was a callback to Lance Reddick&#x27;s interview (2013) in which he mentioned LeVar by name and dressed as an amalgam of Kunta Kinte and Geordi La Forge.

Burton served as a guest host on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; from July 26 to 30, 2021. This came after a petition asking the show&#x27;s producers to select him was signed by more than 250,000 fans. The ratings during his appearance were below average due to tapering audience curiosity and forced viewership competition with NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which trampled syndicated shows across the board. He has been very critical of the show&#x27;s guest host process, stating that the show&#x27;s then executive producer Mike Richards expressed disbelief about Burton wanting the job. According to Burton, Richards also claimed to have no interest in hosting the show himself even though this was disproven by later events. However, he would later say that the experience taught him that there is a &quot;perfect nature of all things&quot;.

Burton also teaches the &quot;Power of Storytelling&quot; in the MasterClass.

===Directing===
Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Burton directed episodes for each of the various &quot;Star Trek&quot; series then in production. He has directed more &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes than any other former regular cast member.

He has also directed episodes of &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, Scorpion, and &quot;Soul Food: The Series&quot;, as well as the miniseries &quot;Miracle&#x27;s Boys&quot; and the biopic &quot;The Tiger Woods Story&quot;. He also directed the 1999 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Smart House&quot; starring Katey Sagal, Kevin Kilner and Jessica Steen. In August 2020, it was revealed that Burton will sit in the director&#x27;s chair for &quot;Two-Front War&quot; from Lou Reda Productions, a multi-perspective docuseries will give &quot;an emotionally raw look at the connection between the fight for civil rights in America and the struggle for equality of Black soldiers in Vietnam&quot;.

His first theatrical film direction was &quot;Blizzard&quot; (2003), for which he received a &quot;Best of Fest&quot; award from the Chicago International Children&#x27;s Film Festival, and a Genie Award nomination for his work on the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Center of My Heart&quot;.

Burton was an alternate board director in 2000 and was elected to the board of directors for the Directors Guild of America in 2005 and re-elected in 2007.

For his commitment to public service, Burton was awarded the Common Wealth Awards of Distinguished Service in 2023.

==Personal life==
LeVar Burton married Stephanie Cozart, a professional make-up artist, on October 3, 1992. Burton has two children, son Eian Burton Smith and daughter Michaela &quot;Mica&quot; Jean Burton. The family lives in Sherman Oaks, California.

Burton does not identify with any religion, saying: &quot;I walked away from the seminary, I walked away from Catholicism, I walked away from organized religion because I felt that there was more for me to explore in the world, and that I could do that without adhering to one specific belief system or another.&quot;

In 2012, Burton joined the board of directors for the AIDS Research Alliance, a non-profit, medical research organization dedicated to finding a cure for AIDS.

In 2016, Burton was one of the five inaugural honorees to the Sacramento Walk of Stars. In 2019, Councilmember Larry Carr, representing the Meadowview neighborhood, led the renaming of Richfield Park to LeVar Burton Park in his honor. The park is in the Meadowview neighborhood, near the house where Burton and his sisters grew up.

In 2024, while on the show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Burton discovered that he has a white, Confederate great-great-grandfather. Another great-great-grandfather was Hal B. Burton, a Black member of the Arkansas House of Representatives.

<text>Massey University () is a public research university in New Zealand that provides internal and distance education. The university has campuses in Auckland, Palmerston North, and Wellington. Data from Universities New Zealand shows that in 2024 the university had approximately 26,505 students enrolled, making it the country&#x27;s second-largest university. Research is undertaken on all three campuses and people from over 130 countries study at the university. 

According to the university&#x27;s annual report, in 2023, around 17.8% of students were based at the Auckland campus, 19.2% at the Manawatū campus, and 13.9% at the Wellington campus. Distance learning accounted for 45.4% of the student body, while the remaining 3.7% studied at other locations.

==History==
===University of New Zealand===
The New Zealand Agricultural College Act of 1926 laid the foundation for the sixth college of the University of New Zealand (UNZ). It allowed for the amalgamation of the agricultural schools of Victoria University College in Wellington and Auckland University College to establish the New Zealand Agricultural College.

In 1927 the Massey Agricultural College Act was passed, renaming the college &quot;Massey Agricultural College&quot; after former New Zealand Prime Minister William Fergusson Massey, who died in 1925 and had been vigorous in land reform efforts. The Massey Agricultural College Council first met on 1 February 1927, and the Batchelar property, near the present Turitea site, was purchased that June. The college was officially opened for tuition on 20 March 1928 by Minister of Agriculture Oswald Hawken. The first woman to enrol was Enid Hills, who enrolled in 1932.

===Independence and expansion===
With the demise of the University of New Zealand in 1961, it became &quot;Massey College&quot;, and associated closer with Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) until full autonomy could be gained. In 1960 a branch of VUW, the Palmerston North University College (PNUC), was established in Palmerston North to teach humanities and social studies subjects as well as provide distance education, known then as extramural study. On 1 January 1963 PNUC amalgamated with Massey College to form &quot;Massey University College of Manawatu&quot;. The Massey University Act 1963 granted Massey full autonomy and university status with degree conferring powers from 1 January 1964, as well as a new name, &quot;Massey University of Manawatu&quot;. Its present name was adopted in 1966.

Inaugurated with a tree planting ceremony in 1993, classes began at Massey&#x27;s Albany campus that same year.

In December 2010 Massey announced that the Wellington campus would close its School of Engineering and Advanced Technology the next month. Students were offered places at either the Albany or Manawatū campuses with compensation, but those who could not make the move and chose to undertake their degree elsewhere were given no compensation, and only a few papers were able to be cross-credited.

The College of Health was launched in February 2013 with three broad goals: promoting health and wellbeing, disease and injury prevention and protecting people and communities from environmental risks to health.

===Chancellor Kelly&#x27;s resignation===
In December 2016, the Chancellor of the university, Chris Kelly, caused outrage by making several comments in a rural newspaper regarding the gender of those in the veterinarian profession. While outlining changes that were being made to the structure of the university&#x27;s veterinarian and agricultural degrees, Kelly said that more women passed the first year of the veterinarian degree &quot;because women mature earlier than men, work hard and pass. Whereas men find out about booze and all sorts of crazy things during their first year... That’s fine, but the problem is one woman graduate is equivalent to two-fifths of a full-time equivalent vet throughout her life because she gets married and has a family, which is normal.&quot; These remarks caused widespread outrage, with Kelly&#x27;s apology via Twitter and Facebook doing little to calm the situation. Kelly resigned as Chancellor on 14 December 2016, and was replaced promptly by then Pro Chancellor Michael Ahie.

===2018 Don Brash visit===
In August 2018 Don Brash, a former Leader of the Opposition, was due to speak at the university following an invitation of the Massey University Politics Society. Citing security concerns, Jan Thomas, the Vice Chancellor of Massey University, cancelled the booking the student society had made to use university facilities. Thomas was widely criticised and calls were made for her resignation. The Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern described canceling the event as an overreaction. A review by Massey University&#x27;s Council subsequently cleared Thomas of wrongdoing, with Chancellor Michael Ahie stating that the Council supported and had full confidence in Professor Thomas. Massey University&#x27;s Māori staff association Te Matawhānui publicly spoke out in support of Thomas, particularly due to her leadership of Massey as a te Tiriti-led university.

===2020s===
Since 2020, Massey University has been using an artificial intelligence remote exam monitoring tool called Remote Proctor Now (RPNow).

In 2023, Massey controversially proposed opening a campus in Singapore, aiming to have 5,000 students based offshore by 2026. The university’s plans to expand overseas while cutting jobs at home angered staff and students at a time when significant cost cutting was taking place under Vice Chancellor Jan Thomas. The university reported a loss estimated at $50 million as of October 2023, which had previously been reported as $33 million in September 2023 and at $14.2 million deficit in July 2023. Cuts, including reducing staff numbers in the schools of Natural Sciences and Food and Advanced Technology by around 60 per cent, were described as &#x27;brutal&#x27; with Radio New Zealand reporting fears the plan puts the university into a death spiral.

On 14 December 2023, Massey University confirmed that it would lay off over 60 jobs at its College of Sciences as part of a restructure. On 18 December, Massey confirmed that it was planning to sell or lease NZ$151 million worth of property on its three campuses to address its financial problems. The affected properties include nine buildings at the Albany campus including lecture halls and a recreation centre, four buildings in Wellington, and nine in Manawatū including two student villages and farmland. Under the proposed sale, the university would sell of much of its Albany campus except the new science building.

==Campuses==

Massey University has campuses in Palmerston North in the Manawatū, in Wellington (in the suburb of Mt Cook) and on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore in Albany. In addition, Massey offers most of its degrees extramurally within New Zealand and internationally. Research is undertaken on all three campuses.

New Zealand&#x27;s first satellite, KiwiSAT was designed and built by New Zealand Radio Amateurs with the support of Massey, especially in space environment testing. &quot;At the AMSAT-ZL Annual General Meeting in June, 2023 the group officially decided to dissolve and abandon plans for a luanch campaign.&quot;

=== Auckland campus (Ōtehā) ===

Since 1993 the Ōtehā campus in Auckland has grown rapidly in a fast developing part of Auckland&#x27;s North Shore City. Science and Business are the two largest colleges on the campus, with the College of Science housing the New Zealand Institute for Advanced Study solely on the campus. Around 4,809 students are enrolled at Albany. This campus has grown since then and an on-campus accommodation facility opened in semester one 2015. On the Albany campus, a large golden chicken wing sculpture commemorates the site&#x27;s history as a chicken farm.

=== Palmerston North campus (Manawatū) ===
Massey University was first established at the Turitea campus in Palmerston North, and hosts around 4,933 students annually.

The Turitea site houses the main administrative units of Massey University as well as the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Sciences, the College of Health and Massey Business School. It is also home to the only Veterinary School in New Zealand. Massey University acquired a smaller second campus in Palmerston North in Hokowhitu when it merged with the Palmerston North College of Education in 1996, which was combined with the existing Faculty of Education to form Massey University&#x27;s College of Education. In 2013 the Institute of Education was formed as part of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The Hokowhitu Campus was later sold in 2016 after the institute was relocated to the Turitea campus.
Wharerata is a historic colonial home built in 1901 and surrounded by formal gardens and mature trees. It housed the staff social club until the late 1990s, and is now used as a cafe, function centre and wedding venue.

In 2019, Heritage New Zealand listed student hostel, Colombo Hall as a category 2 historic place. It was built in 1964.

In February 2023 the university announced that it would be building two solar farms on the Palmerston North campus, with a peak output of 7.87MW.

=== Wellington campus (Pukeahu) ===
The Pukeahu campus in Wellington campus was created through the merger with Wellington Polytechnic that was approved by the New Zealand Government and took place in 1999. The history of Wellington Polytechnic goes back to 1886 when the Wellington School of Design was established, it had a name change in 1891 to Wellington Technical School and in 1963 it was divided into Wellington Polytechnic and Wellington High School.

The Pukeahu campus primarily specialises in Design (College of Creative Arts), Nursing and Communication and Journalism. It has over 2,812 students.

===Extramural===
Extramural study first began in 1960 and Massey University is New Zealand&#x27;s largest and pre-eminent provider of distance education. Massey is known for its flexible learning and innovative delivery options and this tradition continues in the use of blended and online learning.

In the mid-2010s, the university embarked on a major project to further digitise its distance delivery and in 2015 adopted Moodle (branded as Stream) as its new Learning Management System (LMS).

===Libraries===
The Massey University Library was first established at Massey Agricultural College in 1930 when the first librarian, Erica Baillie, was appointed at the college. The library of the Palmerston North University College became part of the Massey College Library after the merger of the two institutions in 1963. With the expansion of the university to other locations, site libraries were established. These include the Auckland campus library in 1993, the Hokowhitu site library in 1996 (since closed) with the merger with Palmerston North College of Education, and Wellington campus library in 1999 with the merger with Wellington Polytechnic. For a time in the 2000s, a site library was also operated at Ruawharo in Napier.

Like the university, the library has grown exponentially since the 1960s. It caters for both on-campus and distance students. Māori materials are well represented in the library collections. Among the collections with Māori material are the Ngā Kupu Ora collection, Māori Land Court Minute Books and the Bagnall collection. Heritage collections administered by the library include the Library Special Collections and the Massey University Archives.

==Governance==

The governing body of Massey Agricultural College, and Massey College, was the Council (known as the Board of Governors, between 1938 and 1952). Massey University is governed by the University Council. The council oversees the management and control of the university&#x27;s affairs, concerns and property.

The following table lists those who have held the position of Chair of the Board of Governors of the college and later Chancellor of the university, being the ceremonial head of the institution.

The following table lists those who have held the position of principal of the college and later vice-chancellor of the university, being the chief executive officer of the institution.

<text>Mego was an experimental electronic music independent record label based in Vienna, Austria. The label has been superseded by a new company, Editions Mego, which was set up both to keep Mego albums in print and to issue new albums, run by Peter Rehberg a.k.a. Pita.

==Impact and critical acclaim==
The label&#x27;s efforts were awarded a distinction at the Ars Electronica 1999. In the jury&#x27;s statement, Jim O&#x27;Rourke lauded the label&#x27;s work as defining &quot;a brand new punk computer music&quot;.
