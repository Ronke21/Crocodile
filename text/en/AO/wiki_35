<text>Bridget of Sweden, OSsS ( – 23 July 1373), also known as Birgitta Birgersdotter and Birgitta of Vadstena (), was a Swedish Catholic mystic and the founder of the Bridgettines. Outside Sweden, she was also known as the Princess of Nericia and was the mother of Catherine of Vadstena.

Bridget is one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Catherine of Siena and Teresa Benedicta of the Cross.

== Biography ==

The most celebrated saint of Sweden, Bridget was the daughter of the knight Birger Persson of the family of Finsta, governor and lawspeaker of Uppland, and one of the richest landowners of the country, and his wife Ingeborg Bengtsdotter, a member of the so-called Lawspeaker branch of the Folkunga family. Through her mother, Bridget was related to the Swedish kings of her era.

She was born in 1303. The exact date of her birth is not recorded. In 1316, at the age of 13 she married Ulf Gudmarsson of the family of Ulvåsa, a noble and lawspeaker of Östergötland, to whom she bore eight children, four daughters and four sons. Six of her children survived infancy, which was rare at that time. Her eldest daughter was Märta Ulfsdotter. Her second daughter is now honored as St. Catherine of Sweden. Her youngest daughter was Cecilia Ulvsdotter. Bridget became known for her works of charity, particularly toward Östergötland&#x27;s unwed mothers and their children. When she was in her early thirties, she was summoned to be principal lady-in-waiting to the new Queen of Sweden, Blanche of Namur. In 1341, she and her husband went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.

In 1344, shortly after their return, Ulf died at the Cistercian Alvastra Abbey in Östergötland. After this loss, Bridget became a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and devoted herself to a life of prayer and caring for the poor and the sick.

It was at this time that she developed the idea of establishing the religious community which was to become the religious order of the Most Holy Saviour, or the Bridgettines, whose principal house at Vadstena was later richly endowed by King Magnus IV of Sweden and his queen. One distinctive feature of the houses of the Order was that they were double monasteries, with men and women both forming a joint community, but they lived in separate cloisters. They were required to live in poor convents and they were also required to give all of their surplus income to the poor. However, they were allowed to have as many books as they pleased.

In 1350, a Jubilee Year, Bridget braved a plague-stricken Europe to make a pilgrimage to Rome accompanied by her daughter, Catherine, and a small party of priests and disciples. This was partly done to obtain authorization to found the new order from the Pope and it was also partly done in pursuance of her self-imposed mission to elevate the moral tone of the age. This was during the period of the Avignon Papacy within the Roman Catholic Church, however, so she had to wait for the return of the papacy from the French city of Avignon to Rome, a move for which she agitated for many years.

It was not until 1370 that Pope Urban V, during his brief attempt to re-establish the papacy in Rome, confirmed the Rule of the order, but meanwhile Bridget had made herself universally beloved in Rome by her kindness and good works. Save for occasional pilgrimages, including one to Jerusalem in 1373, she remained in Rome until her death on 23 July 1373, urging ecclesiastical reform.

In her pilgrimages to Rome, Jerusalem and Bethlehem, she sent &quot;back precise instructions for the construction of the monastery&quot; now known as the Blue Church, insisting that an &quot;abbess, signifying the Virgin Mary, should preside over both nuns and monks.&quot;

Bridget went to confession every day, and she had a constant smiling, glowing face. Although she never returned to Sweden, her years in Rome were far from happy, she was hounded by debts and opposition to her work against Church abuses. She was originally buried at San Lorenzo in Panisperna before her remains were returned to Sweden. 
===Sainthood===
After Queen Margaret of Scandinavia had worked on both Pope Urban VI and his successor for it, Bridget was canonized in the year 1391 by Pope Boniface IX, which was confirmed by the Council of Constance in 1415. Because of new discussions about her works, the Council of Basel confirmed the orthodoxy of her revelations in 1436.

== Visions ==

At the age of ten, Bridget had a vision of Jesus hanging upon the cross. When she asked who had treated him like this, he answered:

The Passion of Christ became the center of her spiritual life from that moment on. The which she had received since her childhood now became more frequent, and the records of these &quot;Revelationes coelestes&quot; (&quot;Celestial revelations&quot;) which were translated into Latin by Matthias, canon of Linköping, and her confessor, Peter Olafsson, prior of Alvastra, acquired a great vogue during the Middle Ages. These revelations made Bridget something of a celebrity to some and a controversial figure to others.

=== Vision of the birth of Christ with kneeling Virgin ===

Her visions of the Nativity of Jesus would influence later depictions of the Nativity of Jesus in art. Shortly before her death, she described a vision which included the infant Jesus lying on (not in) clean swaddling clothes on the ground, and emitting light himself, and she described the Virgin as blonde-haired and kneeling in prayer exactly as she was moments before the spontaneous birth, with her womb shrunken and her virginity intact. 

Many depictions followed this scene, they included the popular ox and donkey and they reduced other light sources in the scene in order to emphasize the &quot;child of light&quot; effect, and the Nativity was treated with chiaroscuro through the Baroque. Other details which are frequently seen, such as Joseph carrying a single candle that he &quot;attached to the wall,&quot; and the presence of God the Father above, also originated in Bridget&#x27;s vision.

The pose of the Virgin kneeling to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, technically known as the &quot;Adoration of the Child&quot;, became one of the most common depictions in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West. A few earlier depictions of the Virgin which show her with an ox and a donkey (scenes which are not described in the gospels) were produced as early as 1300, before Bridget was born, have a Franciscan origin, by which she may have been influenced, because she was a member of the Franciscan order.

Her visions of Purgatory were also well-known.

===Prophecy===
In addition, &quot;she even predicted an eventual Vatican State, foretelling almost the exact boundaries delineated by Mussolini for Vatican City in 1921.&quot;

Pope Benedict XVI spoke of Bridget in a general audience on 27 October 2010, saying that the value of Saint Bridget&#x27;s Revelations, sometimes the object of doubt, was specified by Pope John Paul II in the letter &quot;Spes Aedificandi&quot;: &quot;Yet there is no doubt that the Church,&quot; wrote my beloved predecessor, &quot;which recognized Bridget&#x27;s holiness without ever pronouncing on her individual revelations, has accepted the overall authenticity of her interior experience.&quot;

==Fifteen &#x27;Our Father and Hail Mary prayers&#x27;==

Saint Bridget prayed for a long time to know how many blows Jesus Christ suffered during the Passion. Jesus was said to have responded to these prayers by appearing to her and stating that &quot;I received 5480 blows upon My Body. If you wish to honor them in some way, recite fifteen Our Fathers and fifteen Hail Marys with the following Prayers, which I Myself shall teach you, for an entire year. When the year is finished, you will have honored each of My Wounds.&quot; 

 became known as the &quot;Fifteen O&#x27;s&quot; because in the original Latin, each prayer began with the words &quot;O Jesu&quot;, &quot;O Rex&quot;, or &quot;O Domine Jesu Christe&quot;. Some have questioned whether Saint Bridget is in fact their author; Eamon Duffy reports that the prayers probably originated in England, in the devotional circles that surrounded Richard Rolle or the English Brigittines.

Whatever their origin, the prayers were widely circulated in the late Middle Ages, and they became regular features in Books of Hours and other devotional literature. They were translated into various languages; an early English language version of them was printed in a primer by William Caxton. The prayers themselves reflect the late medieval tradition of meditation on the passion of Christ, and are structured around the seven last words of Christ. They borrow from patristic and Scriptural sources as well as the tradition of devotion to the wounds of Christ.

During the Middle Ages, the prayers were circulated with various promises of indulgence and other assurances of 21 supernatural graces supposed to attend the daily recitation of the 15 orations at least for a year. These indulgences were repeated in the manuscript tradition of the Books of Hours, and may constitute one major source of the prayers&#x27; popularity in the late Middle Ages. They promise, among other things, the release from Purgatory of fifteen of the devotee&#x27;s family members, and that they would keep fifteen living family members in a state of grace.

The extravagance of the promises which were made in these rubrics—one widely circulated version promised that the devotee would receive &quot;his heart&#x27;s desire, if it be for the salvation of his soul&quot;—attracted critics early and late. In 1538, William Marshall enjoined his readers to &quot;henseforth ... forget suche prayers as seynt Brigittes &amp; other lyke, whyche greate promyses and perdons haue falsly auaunced.&quot;

Martin Luther strongly rejected the Roman Catholic belief in the 21 promises and nicknamed St Bridget &quot;Die tolle Brigit&quot; (The foolish Bridget).
In the following decades, Protestantism sought to eradicate the devotion to similar angelic and spiritual entities claiming they were a &#x27;popish&#x27; and &#x27;pagan&#x27; legacy. Lutheranism and Calvinism were characterized by a lower degree of Marian devotion than that pertaining to the Roman Catholic Church, particularly with reference to the Marian title of Queen of Angels.

The Vatican and the Lutheran Church jointly conceived a modern devotion to St Bridget which had remained a relevant factor of disagreement between the two churches till then. 
In 1954, the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office ruled that the alleged promises (though not the prayers themselves) are unreliable, and it directed local ordinaries not to permit the circulation of pamphlets which contain the promises.

The ecumenical process of reconciliation culminated on 8 October 1991 during the sexcentennial of St Bridget&#x27;s canonization, when Pope John Paul II and two Lutheran bishops met and prayed in front of the burial place of St Peter Apostle, in Rome. It was the first time in which a joint prayer was said by members of the two communities.

== Veneration ==

The Brigitta Chapel was erected in 1651 in Vienna, and in 1900 the new district Brigittenau was founded. In Sweden, adjacent to Skederid Church, built by Bridget&#x27;s father on the family&#x27;s land, a memorial stone was erected in 1930.

On 1 October 1999, Pope John Paul II named Saint Bridget a patron saint of Europe. Her feast day is celebrated on 23 July, the day of her death. Her feast was not in the Tridentine calendar, but was inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1623 for celebration on 7 October, the day of her 1391 canonization by Pope Boniface IX. Five years later, her feast day was moved to 8 October (but the Church in Sweden celebrates it on the 7th), a date which was not changed until the revision of the General Roman Calendar in 1969, when it was set on 8 October, the date which it is currently celebrated on. Some continue to use the earlier General Roman Calendar of 1954, the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, or the General Roman Calendar of 1960.

The Third Order of Saint Francis includes her feast day on its Calendar of saints on the same day as the general Church, honoring her as a member of the order.

The Bjärka-Säby Monastery contains a portrait of Bridget of Sweden which is venerated by Christians who are members of several denominations. An hour away from this monastery, the Vadstena Abbey, also known as the Blue Church, contains relics of the saint, and her body is venerated by Lutheran and Catholic believers.

Bridget is remembered by the Church of England, which holds a commemoration on 23 July and on the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar on 7 October.

== Evaluations and interpretations ==
Although he was initially interested in Bridget&#x27;s &quot;Revelations&quot;, Martin Luther would later conclude that her visions were mere ravings. Some 19th-century writers presented her as a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation due to her criticism of popes, bishops and other members of the clergy who did not live in accordance with the teachings of their religion. However, she never criticized that teaching or the church as such.

Of her as depicted in his play &quot;Folkungasagan&quot; August Strindberg explained Bridget as &quot;a power-hungry, vainglorious woman who intentionally vied for sainthood&quot;, adding &quot;of this unpleasant woman and according to the historical documents I made the uncontrollable ninny now in my drama, although in her honor I let her awaken to clarity about her silliness and her arrogance.&quot;

&quot;Centuries of Selfies&quot; (2020) describes how Bridget damaged King Magnus and Queen Blanche by accusing them of &quot;erotic deviations, extravagance and murderous plots&quot;, a description particularly noted by &quot;Dala-Demokraten&quot; as likely to upset Swedish nuns. With the eventual translation of her Latin works into Swedish, increased understanding and appreciation of her evolved in some Swedish circles, but more historians have shown how Bridget used personally and politically motivated mud-slinging against people she didn&#x27;t like.

<text>Fredrika Bremer (17 August 1801 – 31 December 1865) was a Finnish-born Swedish writer and reformer. Her &quot;Sketches of Everyday Life&quot; were wildly popular in Britain and the United States during the 1840s and 1850s and she is regarded as the Swedish Jane Austen, bringing the realist novel to prominence in Swedish literature. In her late 30s, she successfully petitioned King Charles XIV for emancipation from her brother&#x27;s wardship; in her 50s, her novel &quot;Hertha&quot; prompted a social movement that granted all unmarried Swedish women legal majority at the age of 25 and established Högre Lärarinneseminariet, Sweden&#x27;s first female tertiary school. It also inspired Sophie Adlersparre to begin publishing the &quot;Home Review&quot;, Sweden&#x27;s first women&#x27;s magazine as well as the later magazine &quot;Hertha&quot;. In 1884, she became the namesake of the Fredrika Bremer Association, the first women&#x27;s rights organization in Sweden.


==Early life==
Fredrika Bremer was born into a Swedish-speaking Finnish family on 17 August 1801 at Tuorla Manor in Piikkiö Parish outside of Åbo, Sweden (now Turku, Finland). She was the second daughter of five and the second child of seven of (1770–1830) and Birgitta Charlotta Hollström (1777–1855). Her grandparents Jacob and Ulrika Fredrika Bremer had built up one of the largest business empires in Swedish Finland but, upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1798, Carl liquidated their holdings. (A few years later, the Finnish theater of the Napoleonic Wars would see Finland annexed to Russia.) When Fredrika was three years old, the family moved to Stockholm. The next year, they purchased Årsta Castle, about distant from the capital. Fredrika passed the next two decades of her life summering there and at another nearby estate owned by her father, spending winter in the family&#x27;s Stockholm apartment.

Fredrika and her sisters were raised to marry and became socialites and hostesses within the upper class like their own French-trained mother. They were given the education then conventional for girls of their class in Sweden, with private tutors followed by a family trip through Germany, Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands in 1821 and 1822 before their social debuts. She was a talented miniaturist and studied French, English, and German. She later recounted that she kept a diary for a few years as a girl—&quot;a kind of moral account-current, in which each day was entered, with a short observation of &quot;good&quot;, or &quot;bad&quot;, or &quot;middling&quot;&quot;—but, as the yearly totals always showed the middling days&#x27; totals to be greatest, she tired of it and thereafter only kept them while traveling as notes for others. Bremer found the limited and passive family life of Swedish women of her time suffocating and frustrating and her own education was unusually strict, with rigid timetables governing her days. She described her family as &quot;under the oppression of a male iron hand&quot;: While in Stockholm, the girls were forbidden from playing outside and took their exercise by jumping up and down while holding onto the backs of chairs. She wrote French poetry as early as the age of eight, but considered her time in Paris disappointing because of her father&#x27;s bad temper. She was considered awkward and rebellious throughout her childhood; and one of her sisters later wrote of how she enjoyed cutting off parts of her dresses and curtains and throwing things into the fire to watch them burn.

==Early adulthood==
Upon her return to Sweden, she debuted into upper-class society in Stockholm and Årsta but found the enforced passivity of women&#x27;s life intolerable: &quot;How quietly, like muddy water, time stands for a youth, who, during a boring and idle life, drags out her days.&quot; She was deeply touched by Schiller&#x27;s poems and began to long for some career through which she could do good in the world beyond ladies&#x27; traditional employments. As she later wrote, &quot;Embroidering an eternal and gray collar, I grew more and more numb... that is, in my living powers, my wish to live. The feeling of torment did not grow numb. It worsened day by day, like frost during a growing winter. The fire of my soul flickered anxiously with but one wish—to forever die out&quot;. The &quot;non-life&quot; she saw awaiting her prompted an outbreak of depression. Her resolve to find work at one of Stockholm&#x27;s hospitals was undermined by a sister, but she found great satisfaction in charity work around the family&#x27;s estate in Årsta during the winters of 1826–7 and 1827–8.

Her social work was the beginning of her literary career, as she began writing and seeking publishers in 1828 with the initial purpose of using her education in art and literature to earn funds for her charity work. (She had written an outraged retort against the male &quot;tyranny&quot; espoused in Johan Olof Wallin&#x27;s Lutheran sermon &quot;On the Quiet Calling of Women&quot; the year before but it was only published posthumously.) Her 4-volume &quot;Sketches of Everyday Life&quot; was published as an anonymous serial from 1828 to 1831 and became an immediate success, particularly the comic &quot;Family &quot; which appeared in the second and third volumes. She described the process as a revelation, as, once she had begun to write, she felt the words coming &quot;as champagne bubbles out of a bottle&quot;. The Swedish Academy awarded her their lesser gold medal on 1 January 1831; she continued to write for the remainder of her life.

Her success and desire to keep writing drove her to study literature and philosophy in greater depth. An English friend Frances Lewin introduced her to Bentham&#x27;s Utilitarianism, which liberalized her political views. Bentham&#x27;s idea of providing &quot;the greatest happiness to the greatest number&quot; also encouraged her to continue devoting her time to her writing instead of nursing. In the autumn 1831, she began taking private lessons from Per Johan Böklin (1796-1867), a reform educator and the principal of a school in Kristianstad. He challenged her support of Enlightenment and Classicist figures such as Herder and Schiller with a conception of Romanticism grounded in Plato. The lessons continued until the summer of 1833, by which time they were very close. She wrote during the time &quot;I want to kiss a man, breastfeed a baby, manage a household, to be happy, and think of nothing except for them and the praise of God.&quot; She hesitated, however, in accepting Böklin&#x27;s proposal of marriage and, after he hastily married another woman in 1835, she retired from Stockholm&#x27;s society life and never married. The two remained close correspondents for the rest of their lives. &quot;The President&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1834) is considered to represent Bremer&#x27;s increased maturity, using a well-observed portrayal of childhood for its humor while soberly illustrating a reserved young woman&#x27;s blossoming into a more open and friendly way of life. &quot;Nina&quot;, its 1835 sequel, attempted to wed her realistic style with more of the speculative philosophy she discussed with Böklin, an artistic failure that was harshly reviewed, not least by Böklin and Bremer themselves.

==Writing career==
For the next five years, Bremer settled as the guest of her friend Countess Stina Sommerheilm at Tomb Manor in Norway. She initially planned to work as a nurse at one of the local hospitals but again demurred, instead devoting her time to literature. During this period, the countess&#x27;s stories of an elderly relative inspired Bremer&#x27;s 1837 masterpiece . Her close study of the works of Goethe and Geijer—whom she met during a visit to Stockholm in 1837–8—informed several aspects of her next novel, &quot;The Home&quot; (1839). Her male contemporaries&#x27; Gothicism prompted her 1840 play &quot;The Thrall&quot;, dealing with women&#x27;s lot during the Viking Age. After the countess&#x27;s death, Bremer returned to Stockholm in 1840.

Since her father&#x27;s death in 1830, Fredrika had grown closer to her mother. However, under the terms of Sweden&#x27;s 1734 Civil Code, all unmarried women were minors under the guardianship of their closest male relative until they married, at which time they were placed under the guardianship of their husbands. Only widowed and divorced women were automatically of legal majority. Under this law, she and her unmarried sister Agathe were, since the death of their father, both wards of their elder brother who legally had complete control over their finances, an arrangement which displeased them, as their brother had irresponsibly squandered the family fortune over the last decade. The only remedy for the situation was a direct appeal to the King; such petitions, which were common for businesswomen, were customarily given a favorable reply, and their petition was approved and they were formally granted legal majority in 1840. She spent the winter of 1841–42 alone in Årsta Castle, spending her time completing the tract &quot;Morning Watches&quot; (1842), in which she stated her personal religious belief as a matter of sense first and of mystic revelation second. This aroused some opposition but she was supported by Geijer, Tegnér, and Böklin. More importantly, the work was the first which she signed by her own full name, instantly making her a literary celebrity. In 1844, the Swedish Academy awarded her their greater gold medal.

In 1842, Bremer ended the self-imposed isolation in which she had lived since Böklin&#x27;s marriage and returned to Swedish social circles, which she portrayed in her &quot;Diary&quot; the next year. The work also served as her contribution to the discussion engendered by Almqvist&#x27;s controversial &quot;Sara Videbeck&quot;. Despite being &quot;dreadfully plain&quot;, her many friends knew her as humble but loyal, energetic, and strong-willed. She proclaimed that cared little for material possessions: when asked by Carl Gustaf von Brinkman why she could never be an art collector, she replied that &quot;It is certain that nothing worth money would ever be happy with me—even a Swedish Academy medal. Offer me 50 dalers for anything except a warm overcoat and I will let it go.&quot; Regarding her unselfishness, Geijer once remarked that, &quot;my dear Fredrika, if you truly could push us all into heaven, you wouldn&#x27;t mind staying outside yourself.&quot;

She began traveling first around Sweden and then abroad. Brockhaus inaugurated its 1841 series &quot;Select Library of Foreign Classics&quot; () with a translation of &quot;Neighbors&quot; and its success led them to publish seven other volumes of Bremer&#x27;s works by the end of the next year. By then, Mary Howitt had begun publishing English translations in London and New York; these proved even more popular in England and United States than the original works had been in Sweden, ensuring her warm welcomes while overseas. After each journey, Bremer published successful volumes of descriptions or diary entries of the locations she visited. Her 1846 visit to the Rhineland prompted her 1848 volumes &quot;A Few Leaves from the Banks of the Rhine&quot;, &quot;Midsummer Journey&quot;, and &quot;Sibling Life&quot;, the last recounting her impressions of the tensions leading up to the overthrow of King Louis Philippe in France.

==Travel==
Inspired by the work of De Tocqueville and Martineau, Bremer visited and traveled extensively through the United States. Leaving Copenhagen on 11 September 1849, she arrived in New York on 4 October. With the intent of studying the effect of democratic institutions upon society, particularly for women, she visited Boston and New England, where she met Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, Hawthorne, and Irving; the Shaker and Quaker communities of the Mid-Atlantic States; the South, where she examined the conditions of its black slaves; and the Midwest, where she toured its Scandinavian communities and Indians. Like De Tocqueville before her, she visited America&#x27;s prisons and spoke with prisoners. She then visited Spanish Cuba before returning to New York, leaving for Europe on 13 September 1851. Throughout her journey, she wrote extensive letters to her sister Agathe which were later edited into her 2-volume 1853 &quot;Homes in the New World&quot;. Having previously portrayed the Swedish home as a world unto itself, she now portrayed the American world as a great home through the many families who hosted her as she roamed. She spent six weeks in Britain, visiting Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and London and meeting Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Kingsley, and George Eliot. Her series of articles about England for the &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; largely concerned her favorable impression of the Great Exhibition, which she visited four times. They were later gathered for English publication as &quot;England in 1851&quot;.

==Activism==
Following her return to Sweden in November, Bremer attempted to engage its middle- and upper-class ladies in social work similar to what she had found in America and England. She co-founded the Stockholm Women&#x27;s Society for Children&#x27;s Care (&#x27; or &#x27;) to assist the orphans left by the 1853 Stockholm cholera outbreak and the Women&#x27;s Society for the Improvement of Prisoners (&quot;&quot;) to provide moral guidance and rehabilitation of female inmates in 1854. On 28 August 1854, amid the Crimean War, the London &quot;Times&quot; published her &quot;Invitation to a Peace Alliance&quot; alongside an editorial rebuke of its contents: a pacifist appeal to Christian women.

In 1856, she published her novel &quot;Hertha&quot; as &quot;A Sketch from Real Life&quot; and concluded its fictionalized assault on the 2nd-class status of adult unmarried women under the 1734 Civil Code with an appendix recounting recent Swedish court cases on the topic. The work prompted the &quot;Hertha&quot; Discussion (&quot;&quot;) throughout Swedish society, reaching Parliament in 1858. There, the old system was reformed to allow (unmarried) women to petition their nearest courthouse (rather than the royal court) at the age of 25. Five years later, the legislation was revisited and all (unmarried) women were considered to automatically reach legal majority at 25. This did not affect the status of married women, who were still under the guardianship of their husbands, or divorced women or widows, who were already of legal majority. The novel also successfully raised the question of a &quot;women&#x27;s university&quot;. Högre Lärarinneseminariet, a state school for the education of female teachers, was opened in 1861.

Bremer was not present during the &quot;Hertha&quot; Discussion, since from 1856 to 1861 she participated in another great journey through Europe and the Levant. Leaving on 27 May 1856, she first visited Switzerland, Brussels, and Paris over the course of a year. She was particularly interested in Switzerland&#x27;s still-nascent &quot;free church&quot;. From September 1857, she traveled through the still-disunified Italian peninsula, contrasting the Catholic practices of the Papal States with the Lutheran Swedish Church. Finally, she left Messina for Malta and thence traveled to Palestine, arriving on 30 January 1859 and, though nearly 60 years old, tracing the life of Jesus Christ by ship, train, wagon, and horseback. She stayed in Constantinople before touring Greece from August 1859 to May 1861. She reached Stockholm on 4 July 1861. Her accounts of the trip were published as &quot;Life in the Old World&quot; in six volumes from 1860 to 1862.

Upon her return to Sweden, she expressed her satisfaction with the reforms &quot;Hertha&quot; had prompted and took an interest in Högre Lärarinneseminariet and its students. She resumed her charitable projects and assisted with the &quot;Home Journal&quot;, the first women&#x27;s magazine in Scandinavia, which Sophie Adlersparre had founded during her absence. After a final trip to Germany from July to October in 1862, she remained in Sweden the rest of her life. She was reportedly pleased with the abolition of the Diet in Sweden and of slavery in the United States. She died at Årsta Castle outside of Stockholm on 31 December 1865.

==Legacy==
Fredrika Bremer is the namesake of Frederika, a town in the American state of Iowa, and its surrounding Bremer County. She is also the namesake of Fredrika Bremer Intermediate School in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, includes a Fredrika Bremer Room dedicated to her accomplishments.

===Literary===
Fredrika Bremer&#x27;s novels were usually romantic stories of the time, typically concerning an independent woman narrating her observations of others negotiating the marriage market. She argued for a new family life less focused on its male members and providing a larger place for women&#x27;s talents and personalities. Reflecting her own childhood, many of her works include a sharp urban/rural dichotomy; without exception, these present nature as a place of renewal, revelation, and self-discovery.

By the time Bremer revealed her name to the public, her works were an acknowledged part of the cultural life in Sweden. Translations made her still more popular abroad, where she was regarded as the &quot;Swedish Miss Austen&quot;. Upon her arrival in New York, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; claimed she &quot;probably... has more readers than any other female writer on the globe&quot; and proclaimed her the author &quot;of a new style of literature&quot;. A literary celebrity, Bremer was never without a place to stay during her two years in America despite having known no one before her arrival. She was praised by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman and Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; includes a scene of Mrs March reading from Bremer&#x27;s works to her four daughters.

Her popularity abroad crested, however, in the 1840s and 1850s and faded by the turn of the century, although the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read &quot;Hertha&quot; in 1889. Within Sweden, she continued to be highly respected, though little read. The publication of her letters in the 1910s revived scholarly interest, but only in her personal life and travels. By 1948, the Swedish critic Algot Werin was writing that Bremer &quot;really only lives as a name and a symbol... It does not matter if her novels are forgotten.&quot; Bremer&#x27;s novels were rediscovered by Swedish feminists in the latter half of the 20th century and are undergoing critical reëvaluation.

===Social causes===
Fredrika Bremer was interested in contemporary political life and social reform regarding gender equality and social work, and she was active both as an influential participator in the debate of women&#x27;s rights as well as a philanthropist. Politically, she was a liberal, who felt sympathy for social issues and for the working class movement.

In 1853, she co-founded the Stockholms fruntimmersförening för barnavård (Stockholm women&#x27;s fund for child care) with Fredrika Limnell.

In 1854, she co-founded the Women&#x27;s Society for the Improvement of Prisoners (&quot;Fruntimmersällskapet för fångars förbättring&quot;) together with Mathilda Foy, Maria Cederschiöld, Betty Ehrenborg and Emilia Elmblad. The purpose was to visit female prisoners to provide moral support and improve their character by studies of religion. Her novel &quot;Hertha&quot; (1856) remains her most influential work. It is a dark novel about the lack of freedom for women, and it raised a debate in the parliament called &quot;The Hertha debate&quot;, which contributed to the new law of legal majority for adult unmarried women in Sweden in 1858, and was somewhat of a starting point for the real feminist movement in Sweden. &quot;Hertha&quot; also raised the debate of higher formal education for women, and in 1861, the University for Women Teachers, &quot;Högre lärarinneseminariet&quot;, was founded by the state after the suggested women&#x27;s university in &quot;Hertha&quot;. In 1859, Sophie Adlersparre, founded the paper &quot;Tidskrift för hemmet&quot; inspired by the novel. This was the starting point for Adlersparre&#x27;s work as the organizer of the Swedish feminist movement. The women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Hertha&quot;, named after the novel, was founded in 1914.

In 1860, she helped Johanna Berglind to fund &quot;Tysta Skolan&quot;, a school for the deaf and mute in Stockholm. At the electoral reforms regarding the right to vote of 1862, she supported the idea to give women the right to vote, which was talked about as the &quot;horrific sight&quot; of seeing &quot;crinolines at the election boxes&quot;, but Bremer gave the idea her support, and the same year, women of legal majority were granted suffrage in municipal elections in Sweden. The first real Women&#x27;s rights movement in Sweden, the Fredrika Bremer Association (&quot;Fredrika Bremer Förbundet&quot;), founded by Sophie Adlersparre in 1884, was named after her. Bremer was happy to mention and to recommend the work of other female professionals. She mentioned both the doctor Lovisa Årberg and the engraver Sofia Ahlbom in her work.

<text>The [[Château]] de Montreuil-Bellay is a historical building in the town of Montreuil-Bellay, &quot;département&quot; of Maine-et-Loire, France, first built on the site of a Gallo-Roman village high on a hill on the banks of the Thouet River. It is listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture.

During the medieval period the property, consisting of more than , was part of a group of 32 villages near-by that created the then known as &quot;L&#x27;Anjou&quot;. The Mountreil-Bellay fief, first belonged to &quot;Gelduin le Danois&quot; afterward by regal heredity passed to &quot;Berlay le Vieux&quot; who became the first Sir of Bellay, in 1025 the castle was seized by Foulques Nerra a Plantagenet making Giraud Berlay his vassal during the second half of the 12th century. After the defeat of the English by Philip II, the fief returned to a descendant of the Berlay le Vieux family Sir of Bellay, Guillaume de Melun, during this period the fief went under a big renovation by the creation of high massive walls construction including 13 interlocking towers, with entry only via a fortified gateway and the name was anglicized from Barley to Balley.

During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) the town of Montreuil-Bellay was ransacked and burned but the sturdy fortress suffered little damage. Ownership of the castle changed several times including, through marriage, to the Cossé-Brissac family. During the French Revolution the castle was seized by the revolutionary government and used as a prison for women suspected of being royalists.

In 1822 the property was acquired by Saumur businessman Adrien Niveleau, who divided the huge property into rental units. In 1860 Niveleau&#x27;s daughter undertook occupancy and a major restoration campaign, redoing some of the rooms in the &quot;Troubadour&quot; style. Descendants of her husband&#x27;s nephew are the current owners of the property.

Nowadays, Château de Montreuil-Bellay is also the name of a premium wine made on the property.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and myth, Nemesis (; ) also called Rhamnousia (or Rhamnusia; ), was the goddess who personified retribution for the sin of hubris: arrogance before the gods.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Nemesis&quot; is derived from the Greek word , &quot;némein&quot;, meaning &quot;to give what is due&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;nem-&quot; &quot;distribute&quot;.

== Family ==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Nemesis was one of the children of Nyx alone. Nemesis has been described as the daughter of Oceanus, Erebus, or Zeus, but according to Hyginus she was a child of Erebus and Nyx. Some made her the daughter of Zeus by an unnamed mother. In several traditions, Nemesis was seen as the mother of Helen of Troy by Zeus, adopted and raised by Leda and Tyndareus. According to the Byzantine poet Tzetzes, Bacchylides had Nemesis as the mother of the Telchines by Tartarus.

== Mythology ==
=== Fortune and retribution ===

The word &quot;nemesis&quot; originally meant the distributor of fortune, neither good nor bad, simply in due proportion to each according to what was deserved. Later, &quot;Nemesis&quot; came to suggest the resentment caused by any disturbance of this right proportion, the sense of justice that could not allow it to pass unpunished.

O. Gruppe (1906) and others connect the name with &quot;to feel just resentment&quot;. From the fourth century onward, Nemesis, as the just balancer of Fortune&#x27;s chance, could be associated with Tyche.

Divine retribution is a major theme in the Greek world view, providing the unifying theme of the tragedies of Sophocles and many other literary works. Hesiod states: &quot;Also deadly Nyx bore Nemesis an affliction to mortals subject to death&quot; (&quot;Theogony&quot;, 223, though perhaps an interpolated line). Nemesis appears in a still more concrete form in a fragment of the epic &quot;Cypria&quot;.

She is implacable justice: that of Zeus in the Olympian scheme of things, although it is clear she existed prior to him, as her images look similar to several other goddesses, such as Cybele, Rhea, Demeter, and Artemis.

In the Greek tragedies Nemesis appears chiefly as the avenger of crime and the punisher of hubris, and as such is akin to Atë and the Erinyes. She was sometimes called Adrasteia, probably meaning &quot;one from whom there is no escape&quot;; her epithet &quot;Erinys&quot; (&quot;implacable&quot;) is specially applied to Demeter and the Phrygian mother goddess, Cybele.

=== Nemesis and Zeus ===
In some less common traditions, it is Nemesis, rather than the mortal Spartan queen Leda, who is the mother of Helen of Troy. This narrative is first found in the lost epic &quot;Cypria&quot;, the prelude of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. According to its author, Stasinus of Cyprus, Helen was born from the rape of Nemesis by Zeus. Zeus fell in love with Nemesis, here possibly presented as his own daughter, and pursued her, only for her to flee in shame. She took several forms to escape Zeus, but he eventually captured her and forced himself on her.

Apollodorus speaks of a single transformation, into a goose, while Zeus turned into a swan to hunt her down and raped her, producing an egg that was given to the queen of Sparta; Helen hatched from the egg, and was raised by Leda. In another variation, Zeus desired Nemesis, but could not persuade her to sleep with him. So he tasked Aphrodite to transform into an eagle and mock-chase him, while he transformed into a swan. Nemesis, pitying the poor swan, offered it refuge in her arms, and fell into a deep sleep. While asleep, Zeus raped her and in time she bore an egg which was transported to Leda by Hermes. Leda then raised Helen as her own. According to Eratosthenes in his &quot;Catasterismi&quot;, this version was presented by Cratinus.

=== Narcissus ===
In Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses, Nemesis enacted divine retribution on Narcissus for his vanity. After he rejected the advances of the nymph Echo, Nemesis lured him to a pool where he caught sight of his own reflection and fell in love with it, eventually dying. His body was transformed by the nymphs into a narcissus flower.

=== Aura ===
In Nonnus&#x27; epic &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Aura, one of Artemis&#x27; virgin attendants, questioned her mistress&#x27; virginity due to the feminine and curvaceous shape of her body; Aura claimed that no goddess or woman with that sort of figure would be a virgin, and asserted her own superiority over the goddess thanks to her own lean and boyish silhouette. Artemis, enraged, went to Nemesis and asked for revenge. Nemesis promised to the goddess that Aura would have her punishment, and that the punishment would be to lose the virginity she took such pride in. Nemesis then contacted Eros, the god of love, and he struck Dionysus with one of his arrows. Dionysus fell madly in love with Aura, and when she rebuffed his advances, he got her drunk, tied her up and raped her as she lay unconscious, bringing Nemesis&#x27; plan to a success.

==Iconography==
She is portrayed as a winged goddess wielding a whip or a dagger. In early times the representations of Nemesis resembled Aphrodite, who sometimes bears the epithet Nemesis.

As the goddess of proportion and the avenger of crime, she is often depicted wielding a measuring rod (tally stick), a bridle, scales, a sword, and a scourge, and she rides in a chariot drawn by griffins.

The poet Mesomedes wrote a hymn to Nemesis in the early second century AD, where he addressed her:
Nemesis, winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice
and mentioned her &quot;adamantine bridles&quot; that restrain &quot;the frivolous insolences of mortals&quot;.

==Local cult==

A festival called Nemeseia (by some identified with the Genesia) was held at Athens. Its object was to avert the nemesis of the dead, who were supposed to have the power of punishing the living, if their cult had been in any way neglected (Sophocles, &quot;Electra,&quot; 792; E. Rohde, &quot;Psyche,&quot; 1907, i. 236, note I).

===Rhamnous===
As the &quot;Goddess of Rhamnous&quot;, Nemesis was honored and placated in an archaic sanctuary in the district of Rhamnous, in northeastern Attica. There she was a daughter of Oceanus, the primeval river-ocean that encircles the world. Pausanias noted her iconic statue there. It included a crown of stags and little Nikes and was made by Pheidias after the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), crafted from a block of Parian marble brought by the overconfident Persians, who had intended to make a memorial stele after their expected victory.

===Smyrna===
At Smyrna, there were two manifestations of Nemesis, more akin to Aphrodite than to Artemis. The reason for this duality is hard to explain. It is suggested that they represent two aspects of the goddess, the kindly and the implacable, or the goddesses of the old city and the new city refounded by Alexander. The martyrology &quot;Acts of Pionius&quot;, set in the &quot;Decian persecution&quot; of AD 250–51, mentions a lapsed Smyrnan Christian who was attending to the sacrifices at the altar of the temple of these Nemeses.

===Rome===

Nemesis was one of several tutelary deities of the drill-ground (as &quot;Nemesis campestris&quot;). Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that arena personnel such as gladiators, &quot;venatores&quot; and &quot;bestiarii&quot; were personally or professionally dedicated to her cult. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of &quot;Imperial Fortuna&quot; who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidized gifts on the other; both were functions of the popular gladiatorial Ludi held in Roman arenas. She is shown on a few examples of Imperial coinage as &quot;Nemesis-Pax&quot;, mainly under Claudius and Hadrian. In the third century AD, there is evidence of the belief in an all-powerful &quot;Nemesis-Fortuna&quot;. She was worshipped by a society called Hadrian&#x27;s freedmen.

Ammianus Marcellinus includes her in a digression on Justice following his description of the death of Gallus Caesar.

<text>Nemesis is a hypothetical red dwarf or brown dwarf, originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 95,000 AU (1.5 light-years), somewhat beyond the Oort cloud, to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record, which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years. In a 2017 paper, Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was probably part of a binary system at the time of its formation, leading them to suggest &quot;there probably was a Nemesis, a long time ago&quot;. Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago, meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions.

More recent theories suggest that other forces, like close passage of other stars, or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane (Shiva Hypothesis), may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer Solar System objects. In 2010, researchers found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally identified in 1984, but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long. However, in 2011, researchers analyzed the ages of known craters on Earth&#x27;s surface and found strong evidence against periodic impacts, concluding that the earlier findings based on small samples were statistical artifacts. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The 2MASS astronomical survey, which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the Solar System.

Using newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 kelvins out to a distance of 10 light-years from the Sun, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE survey) has not detected Nemesis. In 2011, David Morrison, a senior scientist at NASA known for his work in risk assessment of near Earth objects, has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like Nemesis, since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys.

==Claimed periodicity of mass extinctions==
In 1984, paleontologists David Raup and Jack Sepkoski published a paper claiming that they had identified a statistical periodicity in extinction rates over the last 250 million years using various forms of time series analysis. They focused on the extinction intensity of fossil families of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, and protozoans, identifying 12 extinction events over the time period in question. The average time interval between extinction events was determined as 26 million years. At the time, two of the identified extinction events (Cretaceous–Paleogene and Eocene–Oligocene) could be shown to coincide with large impact events. Although Raup and Sepkoski could not identify the cause of their supposed periodicity, they suggested a possible non-terrestrial connection. The challenge to propose a mechanism was quickly addressed by several teams of astronomers.

In 2010, Melott &amp; Bambach re-examined the fossil data, including the now-improved dating, and using a second independent database in addition to that Raup &amp; Sepkoski had used. They found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity, now going back 500 million years, and at a much higher statistical significance than in the older work.

==Development of the Nemesis hypotheses==
Two teams of astronomers, Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson IV, and Marc Davis, Piet Hut, and Richard A. Muller, independently published similar hypotheses to explain Raup and Sepkoski&#x27;s extinction periodicity in the same issue of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. This hypothesis proposes that the Sun may have an undetected companion star in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically disturbs comets in the Oort cloud, causing a large increase of the number of comets visiting the inner Solar System with a consequential increase of impact events on Earth. This became known as the &quot;Nemesis&quot; or &quot;Death Star&quot; hypothesis.

If it does exist, the exact nature of Nemesis is uncertain. Muller suggests that the most likely object is a red dwarf with an apparent magnitude between 7 and 12, while Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson argue for a brown dwarf. If a red dwarf, it would exist in star catalogs, but it would only be confirmed by measuring its parallax; due to orbiting the Sun it would have a low proper motion and would escape detection by older proper motion surveys that have found stars like the 9th-magnitude Barnard&#x27;s Star. (The proper motion of Barnard&#x27;s Star was detected in 1916.) Muller expects Nemesis to be discovered by the time parallax surveys reach the 10th magnitude.

, more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified. There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf. The majority of solar-type stars are single. The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary, triple, or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars, rather than the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often.

Muller, referring to the date of a recent extinction at 11 million years before the present day, posits that Nemesis has a semi-major axis of about and suggests it is located (supported by Yarris, 1987) near Hydra, based on a hypothetical orbit derived from original aphelia of a number of atypical long-period comets that describe an orbital arc meeting the specifications of Muller&#x27;s hypothesis. Richard Muller&#x27;s most recent paper relevant to the Nemesis theory was published in 2002. In 2002, Muller speculated that Nemesis was perturbed 400 million years ago by a passing star from a circular orbit into an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.7.

In 2010, and again in 2013, Melott &amp; Bambach found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity. However, because Nemesis is so distant from the Sun, it is expected to be subject to perturbations by passing stars, and therefore its orbital period should shift by 15–30%. The existence of a sharp 27-million year peak in extinction events is therefore inconsistent with Nemesis.

==Orbit of Sedna==
The trans-Neptunian object Sedna has an extra-long and unusual elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging between 76 and 937 AU. Sedna&#x27;s orbit takes about 11,400 years to complete once. Its discoverer, Michael Brown of Caltech, noted in a &quot;Discover&quot; magazine article that Sedna&#x27;s location seemed to defy reasoning: &quot;Sedna shouldn&#x27;t be there&quot;, Brown said. &quot;There&#x27;s no way to put Sedna where it is. It never comes close enough to be affected by the Sun, but it never goes far enough away from the Sun to be affected by other stars.&quot; Brown therefore postulated that a massive unseen object may be responsible for Sedna&#x27;s anomalous orbit. This line of inquiry eventually led to the hypothesis of Planet Nine.

Brown has stated that it is more likely that one or more non-companion stars, passing near the Sun billions of years ago, could have pulled Sedna out into its current orbit. In 2004, Kenyon forwarded this explanation after analysis of Sedna&#x27;s orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes.

==Past, current, and pending searches for Nemesis==
Searches for Nemesis in the infrared are important because cooler stars comparatively shine brighter in infrared light. The University of California&#x27;s Leuschner Observatory failed to discover Nemesis by 1986. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The 2MASS astronomical survey, which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect a star, or brown dwarf, in the Solar System. If Nemesis exists, it may be detected by Pan-STARRS or the planned LSST astronomical surveys.

In particular, if Nemesis is a red dwarf or a brown dwarf, the WISE mission (an infrared sky survey that covered most of the solar neighborhood in movement-verifying parallax measurements) was expected to be able to find it. WISE can detect 150-kelvin brown dwarfs out to 10 light-years, and the closer a brown dwarf is, the easier it is to detect. Preliminary results of the WISE survey were released on April 14, 2011. On March 14, 2012, the entire catalog of the WISE mission was released. In 2014, WISE data ruled out a Saturn or larger-sized body in the Oort cloud out to ten thousand AU.

Calculations in the 1980s suggested that a Nemesis object would have an irregular orbit due to perturbations from the galaxy and passing stars. The Melott and Bambach work shows an extremely regular signal, inconsistent with the expected irregularities in such an orbit. Thus, while supporting the extinction periodicity, it appears to be inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis, though of course not inconsistent with other kinds of substellar objects. According to a 2011 NASA news release, &quot;recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals, and thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed.&quot;

<doc id="89345" wikidata="Q56157" url="?curid=89345" title="Jussi Björling">
<text>Johan Jonatan &quot;Jussi&quot; Björling ( , ; 5 February 19119 September 1960) was a Swedish tenor. One of the leading operatic singers of the 20th century, Björling appeared for many years at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and less frequently at the major European opera houses, including the Royal Opera House in London and La Scala in Milan. He sang the Italian, French and Russian opera repertory with taste.

Bjorling was ranked the greatest singer of the 20th century by a poll of music critics in &quot;Classic CD&quot; magazine (UK) in July 1999.

==Early life==
Björling (surname also spelled as &quot;Bjoerling&quot; and &quot;Bjorling&quot; in English-language sources) was born in Stora Tuna, Borlänge, Dalarna, Sweden, in February 1911. The midwife&#x27;s register shows he was born on 5 February, but the church baptism records erroneously show 2 February, and that was the day on which he celebrated his birthday throughout his whole life. He was known throughout his life by the name Jussi, which he received as a child from his Finnish-born grandmother (Henrika Matilda Björling née Lönnqvist, b. 1844 Pori, d. 1918 Borlänge). His father, David, was an accomplished singer and the first teacher of Jussi and his two brothers, Olle and Gösta, who also went on to become professional singers. He also performed with his sons as &quot;Björlingkvartetten&quot; or the &quot;Björling Male Quartet&quot;. Jussi made his debut public appearance at five years of age. The group performed in concerts throughout Sweden and the United States for years. David Björling died in 1926, leading to the disbandment of the quartet and, as a consequence, Jussi Björling found work as a lamp salesman in Ystad. In 1928, Björling made his radio debut. In the same year, he auditioned for John Forsell, and was admitted to the Opera School and the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

==Career==
Björling made his first stage appearance in the small part as the Lamplighter in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; at the Royal Swedish Opera on 21 July 1930. This was soon followed by his official debut role as Don Ottavio in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; on 20 August 1930, with his teacher John Forsell as the protagonist. His other two official debut roles followed; Arnold in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; on 27 December, and Jonatan in &quot;Saul og David&quot; by Carl Nielsen on 13 January 1931. This led to a contract with the Royal Swedish Opera, where Björling added 53 parts up to 1938. Among the roles he was entrusted was Erik in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, Almaviva in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Duca in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Wilhelm Meister in &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, Vasco Da Gama in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot; with Hjördis Schymberg, Tonio in &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, Florestan in &quot;Fidelio&quot; and Belmonte in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;. He was the first Swedish Dick Johnson in &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, Luigi in &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, Elemer in &quot;Arabella&quot; and Vladimir in &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, notably performing the part opposite Feodor Chaliapin in 1935.

In July 1931 he appeared in recital at Copenhagen&#x27;s Tivoli, his first appearance outside Sweden as an adult. Björling appeared quite frequently as a recitalist, often appearing in summer recitals in Scandinavian &quot;folkparks&quot; and tivolis, while confining himself to more serious music during his recital tours abroad. In 1936–1937 he first appeared in recital and opera in Vienna and Prague and also appeared in Berlin, Dresden and Nuremberg in operas in Swedish in an otherwise German ensemble. In 1937 Björling made his recital debut in London and his first American tour as an adult. Björling made his American concert debut at the Carnegie Hall in 1937 – also appearing in opera in Chicago that year. On 24 November 1938 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot;, where he remained on the roster until 1941, often appearing in opera in San Francisco and Chicago as well.

In December 1940 Arturo Toscanini invited Björling to sing the tenor part in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; in New York, a recording of which exists. Björling also performed the &quot;Verdi Requiem&quot; under Toscanini in 1939 in Lucerne, Switzerland, and in November 1940 in New York, another performance that was recorded and eventually issued as an LP.

Björling made his debut at the Royal Opera House in London in 1939 as Manrico in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. The war confined his appearances to Europe. He appeared in opera in Copenhagen, Helsinki and Budapest and made his Italian debut at the Teatro Comunale, Florence, in 1943 in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. In 1944 Björling was appointed &quot;hovsångare&quot; (i.e. &quot;Royal Court Singer&quot;) by the Swedish King, Gustaf V.

In 1945 Björling returned to the US and appeared frequently at the Metropolitan Opera. He sang many major tenor roles in operas in the French and Italian repertoire, including &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. He appeared as &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in the opening of the 1950–1951 season, but the relationship with Rudolf Bing was strained, and as a consequence he was absent for a couple of seasons in the mid 1950s. Meanwhile, Björling appeared with other American opera companies such as Lyric Opera of Chicago and San Francisco Opera.

Björling appeared at La Scala in 1946 in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and 1951 in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. His planned Paris début in 1953 was cancelled, however, and except for recitals in United Kingdom, some performances in Yugoslavia, East Germany and South Africa in 1954, Björling rarely appeared outside Scandinavia and United States.

On 15 March 1960 Björling suffered a heart attack before a performance of &quot;La Bohème&quot; at Covent Garden. He insisted on singing in spite of his condition. Björling then made a short American tour, making his last operatic performance as &quot;Faust&quot; in San Francisco on 1 April 1960 and his final recital at Skansen, Stockholm, on 20 August 1960 (thirty years to the day after his official debut in 1930). He died of heart-related issues on the island of , Sweden, on 9 September 1960, aged 49.

==Recordings==
In 1951, RCA Victor recorded a series of duets with Björling and baritone Robert Merrill including a noted performance of &quot;Au fond du temple saint&quot; from the opera &quot;The Pearl Fishers&quot; by Georges Bizet. Among the first complete opera recordings to be issued on LP by RCA Victor was a 1952 studio recording of &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, with Björling, Zinka Milanov and Leonard Warren. In 1953, Björling recorded the roles of Turiddu and Canio in complete versions of &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; also for RCA Victor.
In the summer of 1954, Björling recorded Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; with Licia Albanese and Robert Merrill in Rome for RCA Victor followed by &quot;Aida&quot; opposite Milanov and Warren in 1955. Björling, Victoria de los Ángeles and Merrill, made a widely admired recording of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot; conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1956. Björling&#x27;s 1959 EMI recording of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, with de los Angeles in the title role and conducted by Gabriele Santini, is also widely celebrated. In Victoria de los Angeles&#x27;s biography by Peter Roberts (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1982), de los Angeles noted that &quot;In spite of technical developments, none of the Jussi Björling recordings give you the true sound of his voice. It was a far, far more beautiful voice than you can hear on the recordings he left&quot;.

In 1957, Björling, Milanov and Warren made a complete stereo recording of &quot;Tosca&quot;, for RCA Victor in Rome with Erich Leinsdorf conducting. The tenor was awarded the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist (With Or Without Orchestra) for his RCA Victor recital album, &quot;Björling in Opera&quot;.

In 1956, Björling appeared in the NBC television anthology &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; in two programs entitled &quot;Festival of Music&quot; hosted by Charles Laughton, followed by José Ferrer. Björling can be seen with soprano Renata Tebaldi in excerpts from &quot;La Bohème&quot;. Both &quot;Festival of Music&quot; programs, originally broadcast in color, have since been released on black-and-white kinescopes on DVD.

One of Björling&#x27;s final recordings was the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot; conducted by Fritz Reiner for RCA Victor in June, 1960 with Leontyne Price, Rosalind Elias, Giorgio Tozzi, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the chorus of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde.

==Personal life==
Björling was known as the &quot;Swedish Caruso&quot;. His son was also a professional tenor and so is his grandson .


His widow, Anna-Lisa Björling, published a biography with the cooperation of Andrew Farkas that described Björling as a loving family man and generous colleague. However, in the book Anna-Lisa did not attempt to hide the destructive influence of Björling&#x27;s alcoholism.

He is buried in the church cemetery at Stora Tuna, Borlänge, Sweden.

==Legacy==

Gröna Lunds Tivolis Jussi Björling-stipendium (The Gröna Lund Jussi Björling Award) was established in 1963 by the Stockholm amusement park where Björling often sang, for its 80th anniversary.

Jussi Björlings Minnesstipendium (Jussi Björlingstipendiet) was established in 1970 and is administered by Stiftelsen Kungliga Teaterns Solister (The Royal Opera Soloists Foundation) in Stockholm.

The Jussi Björling Recital Hall was dedicated at Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, Minnesota, in 1970.

The Jussi Björling Tenor Competition took place in Borlänge in 1994. 125 tenors from 38 countries participated and winner was the Chinese Deng Xiao-Jun.

Jussi Björlingmuseet (The Jussi Björling Museum) was opened in Borlänge in 1994.

Björling&#x27;s name is now used with the prestigious Jussi Björling Music Scholarship at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota.

An archive of nearly all of Björling&#x27;s recorded performances, photographs, letters, recital and opera programmes, reviews, obituaries, and other items related to his career is maintained at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University Bloomington.

Luciano Pavarotti, in a 1988 interview for the Swedish daily newspaper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, stated:

When I&#x27;m about to train a new opera, I first listen to how Jussi Björling did it. His voice was unique and it&#x27;s his path that I want to follow. I would more than anything else wish that people compared me with Jussi Björling. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;m striving to sing.

<text>The Battle of Pydna took place in 168 BC between Rome and Macedon during the Third Macedonian War. The battle saw the further ascendancy of Rome in the Hellenistic world and the end of the Antigonid line of kings, whose power traced back to Alexander the Great. The battle is also considered to be a victory of the Roman legion&#x27;s manipular system&#x27;s flexibility over the Macedonian phalanx&#x27;s rigidity.

==Prelude==
The Third Macedonian War started in 171 BC, after a number of acts on the part of King Perseus of Macedon incited Rome to declare war. At first, the Romans won a number of small victories, largely due to Perseus&#x27; refusal to consolidate his armies. By the end of the year, the tide changed dramatically and Perseus had gained a success at the Battle of Callinicus and regained most of his losses, including the important religious city of Dion. Perseus then established himself in an unassailable position on the river Elpeus, in northeastern Greece.

The next year, command of the Roman expeditionary force passed to Lucius Aemilius Paullus, an experienced soldier who was one of the consuls for the year. To force Perseus from his position, Paullus sent a small force (8,200 foot and 120 horse) under the command of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum to the coast, a feint to convince Perseus that he was attempting a riverborne flanking maneuver. Instead, that night Scipio took his force south and over the mountains to the west of the Roman and Macedonian armies. They moved as far as Pythion, then swung northeast to attack the Macedonians from the rear.

A Roman deserter, however, made his way to the Macedonian camp and Perseus sent a force of 12,000 under the command of Milo to block the approach road. The encounter that followed sent Milo and his men back in disarray towards the main Macedonian army. After this, Perseus moved his army northwards and took up a position near Katerini, a village south of Pydna. It was a fairly level plain and was very well suited to the phalanx.

Paullus then had Scipio rejoin the main force, while Perseus deployed his forces for what appeared to be an attack from the south by Scipio. The Roman armies were actually to the west, and when they advanced, they found Perseus fully deployed. Instead of joining battle with troops tired from the march, they encamped to the west in the foothills of Mount Olocrus. The night before the battle there was a lunar eclipse, which was perceived by the Macedonians as an ill omen; according to Plutarch, they interpreted it as a sign of their king&#x27;s demise. Meanwhile, Paullus is said to have understood that eclipses occurred at regular intervals but still believed it was necessary to perform sacrifices and wait for &quot;favourable omens.&quot;

The fighting began the afternoon of the next day, June 22. The exact cause of the start of the battle differs; one story is that Paullus waited until late enough in the day for the sun not to be in the eyes of his troops, and then sent an unbridled horse forward to bring about alarm. More likely it was the result of some Roman foragers getting a little too close and being attacked by some Thracians in Perseus&#x27; army.

==Battle==

The Romans had at least 28,600 men, up to 37,000, of which 22,000 to 34,000 were infantry: Romans, Italians, and allies from Greece, Numidia, and Liguria, as well as possibly Hispania. The Macedonians had 43,000 soldiers at the start of the war, of which more than 20,000 were phalangites. The cavalry forces were roughly equal, up to 4,000 Macedonians and Thracians against some 3,400 Romans and allies. By the time of the battle, the Macedonian army numbered closer to 30,000 men. For example, prior to the battle Perseus dispatched 8,000 of his Macedonians to guard against the Roman fleet threatening his rear: 2,000 peltasts, 5,000 phalangites, and 1,000 cavalry. The two armies were drawn up in their usual fashion. The Romans had placed the two legions in the middle, with the allied Latin, Italian, and Greek infantry on their flanks. The cavalry was placed on the wings, with the Roman right being supplemented by 22 elephants. The phalanx took up the center of the Macedonian line, with the elite 3,000-strong Guard formed to the left of the phalanx. Lighter peltasts, mercenaries, and Thracian infantry guarded the two flanks of the phalanx, while the Macedonian cavalry was also most probably arrayed on both flanks. The stronger contingent was on the Macedonian right, where Perseus commanded the heavy cavalry (including his elite Sacred Squadron), and the Thracian Odrysian cavalry were deployed. However, other sources state that the cavalry did not participate in the fight, as there was a strike against Perseus by the nobles.

The two centers engaged at about 3 PM, with the Macedonians advancing on the Romans a short distance from the Roman camp. Paullus claimed later that the sight of the phalanx filled him with alarm and amazement. The Roman allies tried to beat down the enemy pikes or hack off their points, but with little success. Roman allies&#x27; officers began to despair. One &#x27;rent his garments&#x27; in impotent fury. Another seized his unit&#x27;s standard and threw it among the enemy. His men made a desperate charge to recapture it, but were beaten back despite inflicting some casualties. Unable to get under the thick bristle of pikes, the Romans used a planned retreat over the rough ground.

But as the phalanx pushed forward, the ground became more uneven as it moved into the foothills, and the line lost its cohesion, being forced over the rough terrain. Paullus now ordered the legions into the gaps, attacking the phalangites on their exposed flanks. At close quarters the longer Roman sword and heavier shield easily prevailed over the Macedonian Kopis and lighter shields of the Macedonians. They were soon joined by the Roman right, which had succeeded in routing the Macedonian left.

Seeing the tide of battle turn, Perseus fled with the cavalry on the Macedonian right. According to Plutarch, Perseus&#x27; cavalry had yet to engage, and both the king and his cavalry were accused of cowardice by the surviving infantry. Poseidonius claimed that the king was injured by enemy missiles and was brought to the city of Pydna at the start of the battle. However, the 3,000 strong guard fought to the death, nearly 11,000 Macedonians were captured, and Livy reported that his various sources claimed up to 20,000 Macedonian dead. The battle lasted about an hour, but the bloody pursuit lasted until nightfall. Other reports state that due to confusion or tactical error from the king, a corps of 10,000 Macedonians were cut off and did not participate in the engagement.

There were several heroes among the Romans. Paullus&#x27;s son Scipio Aemilianus was thought to be lost for a while, but he and some friends had been pursuing the retreating Macedonians. The son of Cato the Elder, Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus distinguished himself in the battle by his personal prowess in a combat in which he first lost and finally recovered his sword.

The battle is often considered to be a victory of the Roman legion&#x27;s flexibility over the phalanx&#x27;s inflexibility. Nevertheless, modern conclusions are that the loss was actually due to a failure of command on the part of Perseus, as well as the peculiar stance of the Companion cavalry, who did not engage the enemy. From the case of the 3,000 Agema peltasts, who maintained cohesion far longer than the regular phalanx, it may be concluded that the training levels of the troops involved played an important role in determining both the frontal strength of the pike phalanx and the success of infantry trying to break through the pike wall.

==Aftermath==

This was not the final conflict between the two rivals, but it broke the back of Macedonian power. The Battle of Pydna and its political aftermath mark the effective end of Macedonian independence, although formal annexation was still some years away.

The political consequences of the lost battle were severe. Perseus later surrendered to Paullus, and was paraded in triumph in Rome in chains. He was then imprisoned. The Senate&#x27;s settlement included the deportation to Italy of many of the king&#x27;s friends and the imprisonment (later house arrest) of Perseus at Alba Fucens.

The Macedonian kingdom was dissolved, and its government was replaced with four republics which were heavily restricted from intercourse or trade with one another. In time, these were also dissolved, and Macedonia became a Roman province. In 167 BC, Paullus received orders to attack Epirus, resulting in the enslavement of 150,000 Epirotes and the sacking of 70 cities. This took place because the Molossians, one tribe of the Epirote League, had sent aid to Perseus, but all the Epirotes suffered alike in the Roman attack.

The victory was celebrated in Athens, where an inscribed decree passed by the Council and People in 168 BC honours Calliphanes, an Athenian citizen who had been present with the Roman and Attalid armies at Pydna, for bringing news of the victory to Athens.

<doc id="89355" wikidata="Q160250" url="?curid=89355" title="Flag of South Africa">
<text>The national flag of South Africa was designed in March 1994 and adopted on 27 April 1994, during South Africa&#x27;s 1994 general election, to replace the previous flag used from 1928–1994.

The flag has horizontal bands of red (on the top) and blue (on the bottom), of equal width, separated by a central green band which splits into a horizontal &quot;Y&quot; shape, the arms of which end at the corners of the hoist side (and follow the flag&#x27;s diagonals). The &quot;Y&quot; embraces a black isosceles triangle from which the arms are separated by narrow yellow or gold bands; the red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes. The stripes at the fly end are in the 5:1:3:1:5 ratio. Three of the flag&#x27;s colours were taken from the flag of the South African Republic, itself derived from the flag of the Netherlands, as well as the Union Jack, while the remaining three colours were taken from the flag of the African National Congress.
Nicknames for the flag include the &quot;Seskleur&quot; () and the &quot;Rainbow Flag&quot;.

== Colours ==
At the time of its adoption, the South African flag was the only national flag in the world to comprise six colours in its primary design and without a seal and brocade. The design and colours are a synopsis of principal elements of the country&#x27;s flag history. The colours themselves have no essential meaning.

== Symbolism ==
According to official South African government information, the South African flag is &quot;a synopsis of principal elements of the country&#x27;s flag history.&quot; Although different people may attribute personal symbolism to the individual colours or colour combinations , &quot;no universal symbolism should be attached to any of the colours.&quot; The only symbolism in the flag is the V or Y shape, which can be interpreted as &quot;the convergence of diverse elements within South African society, taking the road ahead in unity&quot;. Frederick Gordon Brownell who created the flag has said that the green Y-shaped part of the flag was influenced by the chasubles worn by Anglican priests, and stated that he was influenced to include it as he grew up Anglican.

From time to time explanations of the meanings or symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colours are published in various media, including official government publications and speeches by government officials.

The flag consists of the four colours of the Vierkleur, expanded by the addition of black and gold signifying South Africa&#x27;s mineral wealth. Three of the colours – black, green and gold – are found in the flag of the African National Congress. The other three – red, white and blue – are used in the modern flag of the Netherlands and the flag of the United Kingdom; the colours white and blue were also found in the old flag of South Africa.
Former South African President F.W. de Klerk, who proclaimed the new flag on 20 April 1994, stated in his autobiography, &quot;The Last Trek: a New Beginning&quot;, that chilli red was chosen instead of plain red (which Anglo-Africans would have preferred) or orange (as some Afrikaners would have preferred).

The Second Anglo-Boer War between 1899 and 1902 ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902 and resulted in what is now South Africa falling under the British Union Flag. The former Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek (Transvaal) became British colonies along with the existing Cape and Natal colonies. Each was also entitled to a colonial flag following in the British tradition. 

===1910–1928===

On 31 May 1910 these four colonies came together to form the Union of South Africa and the individual colonial flags were no longer used and new South African flags came into being. Once again, as a British dominion the British Union Flag was to continue as the national flag and the standard British ensign pattern was used as a basis for distinctive South African flags.

As was the case throughout the British Empire, the Red and Blue Ensigns were the official flags for merchant and government vessels at sea, and the British Admiralty authorised them to be defaced in the fly with the shield from the South African coat of arms. These ensigns were not intended to be used as the Union&#x27;s national flag, although they were used by some people as such. Although these ensigns were primarily intended for maritime use, they were also flown on land.

These flags never enjoyed much popular support due to the animosities lingering after the Anglo-Boer War – the Afrikaner descendants of the Dutch settlers from the former Boer Republics saw it as a British flag, and the English-speakers saw it was not the Union Flag alone.

===1928–1994===

Due to the lack of popularity of these flags, there were intermittent discussions about the desirability of a more distinctive national flag for South Africa after 1910, it was only after a coalition government took office in 1925 that a bill was introduced in Parliament to introduce a national flag for the Union. This provoked an often violent controversy that lasted for three years based on whether the British Union Flag should be included in the new flag design or not. The Natal Province even threatened to secede from the Union should it be decided to remove it.

Finally, a compromise was reached that resulted in the adoption of a separate flag for the Union in late 1927 and the design was first hoisted on 31 May 1928. The design was based on the so-called Van Riebeeck flag or &quot;Prince&#x27;s Flag&quot; (&quot;Prinsenvlag&quot; in Afrikaans) that was originally the Dutch flag; it consisted of orange, white, and blue horizontal stripes. A version of this flag had been used as the flag of the Dutch East India Company (known as the VOC) at the Cape (with the VOC logo in the centre) from 1652 until 1795. The South African addition to the design was the inclusion of three smaller flags centred in the white stripe. The miniature flags were the British Union Flag (mirrored) towards the hoist, the flag of the Orange Free State hanging vertically in the middle and the Transvaal Vierkleur towards the fly. The position of each of the miniature flags is such that each has equal status. However, to ensure that the Dutch flag in the canton of the Orange Free State flag is placed nearest to the upper hoist of the main flag, the Free State flag must be reversed. The British Union Flag, which is nearest to the hoist and is thus in a more favoured position, is spread horizontally from the Free State flag towards the hoist and is thus also reversed. Although placed horizontally furthest from the hoist, to balance the British Union Flag, the Vierkleur is the only one of the miniature flags which is spread in the same direction as the main flag. This compensates for its otherwise less favourable position. In this arrangement, each of the miniature flags enjoy equal precedence. Note that the miniature flags of the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State both contain miniature flags of the Netherlands, while the miniature flag of the United Kingdom is a composition of the flags of England, Scotland and the Anglo-Irish people, making the old South African flag the only former national flag in the world containing five flags within three flags within a flag.

The choice of the &quot;Prinsenvlag&quot; (which was believed to be the first flag hoisted on South African soil by Jan van Riebeeck of the VOC) as the basis upon which to design the South African flag had more to do with compromise than Afrikaner political desires, since the &quot;Prinsenvlag&quot; was politically neutral, as it was no longer the national flag of any nation. A further element of this compromise was that the British Union Flag would continue to fly alongside the new South African national flag over official buildings. This dual flag arrangement continued until 1957 when the British Union Flag lost its official status per an Act of Parliament.

Following a referendum the country became a republic on 31 May 1961, but the design of the flag remained unchanged. However, there was intense pressure to change the flag, particularly from Afrikaners who still resented the fact that the British Union Flag was a part of the flag. In 1968, the then Prime Minister, John Vorster, proposed the adoption of a new flag from 1971, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the declaration of a republic but this never materialised.

Since 2019, public display of this flag in South Africa is considered hate speech (for being a potential symbol of apartheid and white supremacy) and therefore prohibited, with exceptions for artistic, academic and journalistic purposes, as well as for museums &amp; places of historical interest.

===1994–present===
The present South African national flag was first flown on 27 April 1994, the day of the 1994 election. However, the flag was first intended to be an interim flag only, and its design was decided upon only a week beforehand.

The choice of a new flag was part of the negotiation process set in motion when Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. When a nationwide public competition was held in 1993, the National Symbols Commission received more than 7,000 designs. Six designs were shortlisted and presented to the public and the Negotiating Council, but none elicited enthusiastic support. A number of design studios were then contacted to submit further proposals, but these also did not find favour. Parliament went into recess at the end of 1993 without a suitable candidate for the new national flag.

In February 1994, Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer, the chief negotiators of the African National Congress and the National Party government of the day respectively, were given the task of resolving the flag issue. A final design was adopted on 15 March 1994, derived from a design developed by the State Herald Fred Brownell, who had also claimed to have previously designed the Namibian flag. This interim flag was hoisted officially for the first time on 27 April 1994, the day when the nation&#x27;s first fully inclusive elections commenced which resulted in Nelson Mandela being inaugurated as South Africa&#x27;s first democratically elected president on 10 May 1994. The flag was well received by most South Africans, though a small minority objected to it; hundreds of Afrikaner Volksfront members in Bloemfontein burned the flag in protest a few weeks before the April 1994 elections.

The proclamation of the new national flag by South African President F. W. de Klerk was only published on 20 April 1994, a mere seven days before the flag was to be inaugurated, sparking a frantic last-minute flurry for flag manufacturers. As stated in South Africa&#x27;s post-apartheid interim constitution, the flag was to be introduced on an interim probationary period of five years, after which there would be discussion about whether or not to change the national flag in the final draft of the constitution. The Constitutional Assembly was charged with the responsibility of drafting the country&#x27;s new constitution and had called for submissions, inter alia, on the issues of its various national symbols. It received 118 submissions recommending the retention of the new flag and 35 suggesting changes to it. Thus on 28 September 1995 it decided that the flag should be retained unchanged and accordingly it was included as Section One of the Constitution of South Africa which came into force in February 1997.

== Proper display of the flag ==
The South African government published guidelines for proper display of the flag at designated flag stations, in Government Notice 510 of 8 June 2001 (Gazette number 22356). These rules apply only to official flag stations and not to the general public.

The Southern African Vexillological Association (SAVA), a non-official association for the study of flags, published their own guide for proper display of the flag in 2002. This guide has no official authority but was drawn up with generally accepted vexillological etiquette and principles in mind.

== Official description ==

An addendum to the Transitional Executive Council agenda (April 1994) described the flag in pseudo-heraldic terms as follows:

&quot;The National flag shall be rectangular in the proportion of two in the width to three to the length; per pall from the hoist, the upper band red (chilli) and lower band blue, with a black triangle at the hoist; over the partition lines a green pall one fifth the width of the flag, fimbriated white against the red and blue, and gold against the black triangle at the hoist, and the width of the pall and its fimbriations is one third the width of the flag.&quot;

Schedule One of the Constitution of South Africa (1996) replaced the heraldic definition and described the flag in plain English as follows:

# &quot;The national flag is rectangular; it is one and a half times as long as it is wide. &quot;
# &quot;It is black, gold, green, white, chilli red and blue. &quot;
# &quot;It has a green Y-shaped band that is one fifth as wide as the flag. The centre lines of the band start in the top and bottom corners next to the flag post, converge in the centre of the flag, and continue horizontally to the middle of the free edge. &quot;
# &quot;The green band is edged, above and below in white, and towards the flag post end, in gold. Each edging is one fifteenth as wide as the flag. &quot;
# &quot;The triangle next to the flag post is black. &quot;
# &quot;The upper horizontal band is chilli red and the lower horizontal band is blue. These bands are each one third as wide as the flag.&quot;

<text>Shiraz wine refers to two different wines. Historically, the name refers to the wine produced around the city of Shiraz in Iran. In the current era, &quot;Shiraz&quot; is an alternative name for the Syrah grape, mostly used in Australia and South Africa. The modern &quot;Shiraz&quot; grape is identical to Syrah and originated in southeast France with no established connection to the city of Shiraz.

==History==
By the 9th century CE, the city of Shiraz had established a reputation for producing the finest wine in the world, and was Iran&#x27;s wine capital. The export of Shiraz wine by European merchants in the 17th century has been documented. As described by enthusiastic English and French travellers to the region in the 17th to 19th centuries, the wine grown close to the city was of a more dilute character due to irrigation, while the best Shiraz wines were actually grown in terraced vineyards around the village of Khollar. These wines were white and existed in two different styles: dry wines for drinking young, and sweet wines meant for aging. The latter wines were compared to &quot;an old sherry&quot; (one of the most prized European wines of the day), and at five years of age were said to have a fine bouquet and nutty flavour. The dry white Shiraz wines (but not the sweet ones) were fermented with significant stem contact, which should have made these wines rich in tannins.

While travellers have described the wines as white, there seem to be no ampelographic descriptions of the vines or grapes. Marco Polo made mention of the wine, and other classical accounts describe vines trained by pulleys and weights to grow up one side of a house and down another.

The British poet Edward FitzGerald later translated the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; from Persian language, in which praise is heaped on the Shiraz wines.

===Modern era===
In modern Iran, Shiraz wine cannot be produced legally due to the prohibition of alcohol in Islam. Before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, there were up to 300 wineries in Iran; now there are none. As a whole, Iran is no longer a wine-producing country, although Iranian Christians are legally allowed to ferment wine.

Despite the name, there is no proven connection between the city of Shiraz and the modern-day red grape variety &quot;Shiraz&quot;, planted in Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Canada, the United States, and some other countries. The modern Shiraz grape, now known to be identical to the Syrah grape, was brought to Australia by James Busby, the father of Australian wine. Busby travelled through Spain and France collecting vine cuttings that were the foundation of the Australian wine industry.

<text>Morton Feldman (January 12, 1926 – September 3, 1987) was an American composer. A major figure in 20th-century classical music, Feldman was a pioneer of indeterminacy in music, a development associated with the experimental New York School of composers also including John Cage, Christian Wolff, and Earle Brown. Feldman&#x27;s works are characterized by notational innovations that he developed to create his characteristic sound: rhythms that seem to be free and floating, pitch shadings that seem softly unfocused, a generally quiet and slowly evolving music, and recurring asymmetric patterns. His later works, after 1977, also explore extremes of duration.

== Biography ==
Morton Feldman was born in Woodside, Queens, New York City, on January 12, 1926. His parents, Irving and Frances Breskin Feldman, were Russian Jews who had emigrated to New York from Pereiaslav (Irving, in 1910) and Bobruysk (Frances, in 1901). His father was a manufacturer of children&#x27;s coats. As a child he studied piano with Vera Maurina Press, who instilled in him a &quot;vibrant musicality rather than musicianship&quot;. Feldman&#x27;s first composition teachers were Wallingford Riegger, one of the first American followers of Arnold Schoenberg, and Stefan Wolpe, a German-born Jewish composer who had studied under Franz Schreker and Anton Webern. Feldman and Wolpe spent most of their time simply talking about music and art.

In early 1950, Feldman heard the New York Philharmonic perform Webern&#x27;s Symphony. After this work, the orchestra was to perform a piece by Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Feldman left immediately, disturbed by the audience&#x27;s disrespectful reaction to Webern&#x27;s work. In the lobby he met John Cage, who was at the concert and had also decided to step out. The two quickly became friends, with Feldman moving into the building Cage lived in. Through Cage, he met sculptor Richard Lippold (who had a studio next door with artist Ray Johnson); artists including Sonja Sekula and Robert Rauschenberg; and composers such as Henry Cowell, Virgil Thomson, and George Antheil. An interview with Feldman was published in the first issue of &quot;0 to 9&quot; magazine in 1967.

With Cage&#x27;s encouragement, Feldman began to write pieces that had no relation to compositional systems of the past, such as traditional tonal harmony or serialism. He experimented with nonstandard systems of musical notation, often using grids in his scores, and specifying how many notes should be played at a certain time but not which ones. Feldman&#x27;s experiments with notation and indeterminacy inspired Cage to write pieces like &quot;Music of Changes&quot;, where the notes to be played are determined by consulting the I Ching.

Through Cage, Feldman met many other prominent figures in the New York arts scene, among them Jackson Pollock, Philip Guston and Frank O&#x27;Hara. He found inspiration in abstract expressionist painting, and in the 1970s wrote a number of pieces around 20 minutes in length, including &quot;Rothko Chapel&quot; (1971; written for the building of the same name, which houses paintings by Mark Rothko) and &quot;For Frank O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1973). In 1977, he wrote the opera &quot;Neither&quot; with original text by Samuel Beckett.

Feldman was commissioned to compose the score for Jack Garfein&#x27;s 1961 film &quot;Something Wild&quot;, but after hearing Feldman&#x27;s music for the opening scene, in which a character (played by Garfein&#x27;s wife Carroll Baker) is raped, the director promptly withdrew his commission, opting to enlist Aaron Copland instead. Garfein&#x27;s reaction was said to be, &quot;My wife is being raped and you write celesta music?&quot;

Feldman&#x27;s music &quot;changed radically&quot; in 1970, moving away from graphic and arhythmic notation systems in favor of rhythmic precision. The first piece of this new period was a short, 55-measure work, &quot;Madame Press Died Last Week at Ninety&quot;, dedicated to his childhood piano teacher.

In 1973, at age 47, Feldman became the Edgard Varèse Professor of Music Composition (a title of his own devising) at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York; until then, he had earned his living as a full-time employee at the family textile business in Manhattan&#x27;s Garment District. Feldman also held residencies at the University of California, San Diego in the 1980s.

Late in his career, Feldman produced a number of very long works, rarely shorter than half an hour and often much longer. These include &quot;Violin and String Quartet&quot; (1985, around 2 hours), &quot;For Philip Guston&quot; (1984, around four hours), and &quot;String Quartet II&quot; (1983, over six hours long without a break). These pieces typically maintain a very slow developmental pace and a very quiet dynamic range. Feldman said at the time that quiet sounds had become the only ones that interested him; in a 1982 lecture, he asked: &quot;Do we have anything in music for example that really wipes everything out? That just cleans everything away?&quot;

Feldman married the Canadian composer Barbara Monk shortly before his death. He died of pancreatic cancer on September 3, 1987, at his home in Buffalo.

* was originally the French 74-gun ship of the line &quot;L&#x27;Invincible&quot;, captured off Cape Finisterre in 1747. She was the first purpose-built 74-gun ship of the line to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship sank in February 1758 when she hit a sandbank in the East Solent.
* was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1765 at Deptford Dockyard and commissioned at Portsmouth in 1776. Her career saw her involvement in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780) (against the Spanish fleet) and the Battle of St. Kitts and the Glorious First of June (both against the French fleet). She was also involved in the capture of St. Lucia, Trinidad and Surinam. She was wrecked off the Norfolk coast in 1801, with the loss of 400 lives.
* was a 74-gun ship, launched at Woolwich in 1808. She saw action in the Peninsular War, supporting the British forces. She was paid off in 1814, and broken up in 1861, in Plymouth.
* HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was to have been the world&#x27;s second ocean-going iron-hulled armoured frigate, and sister to , but she was renamed before her launch.
* was an armoured &quot;broadside battleship&quot; built in 1869. She was renamed &quot;Erebus&quot; in 1904 and &quot;Fisgard II&quot; in 1906, before foundering in a storm in 1914.
* was a battlecruiser of the First World War attached to the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Home Fleet at the end of 1908.

<text>Howard Waldrop (September 15, 1946 – January 14, 2024) was an American science fiction author who worked primarily in short fiction. He received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2021.

==Early life ==
Born in Houston, Mississippi, Waldrop spent most of his life in Texas. He moved to Washington state for several years, but returned to Austin. 

As a child, he corresponded with &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; author George R. R. Martin about their shared love of comic books. He was an avid fly fisherman. He was a member of the Turkey City Writer&#x27;s Workshop, attended the Rio Hondo Writing Workshop, and taught at the Clarion Workshop.

==Career==
Waldrop was a frequent attendee of ArmadilloCon, the local science fiction convention held annually in Austin. He was the Toastmaster at the inaugural ArmadilloCon #1 (1979) and again at ArmadilloCon #29 (2007); he was Guest of Honor at ArmadilloCon #5 (1983).

Waldrop was one of three writer Guests of Honor at the 1995 World Fantasy Convention held in Baltimore and at Readercon 15 held in Burlington, Massachusetts, in 2003.

Waldrop was Professional Writer Guest of Honor at Loscon 46 in Los Angeles, California, in 2019.

In 2004 he started writing movie reviews with Lawrence Person for &quot;Locus Online&quot;.

Waldrop died from a stroke in Austin, on January 14, 2024, at the age of 77.

==Style==
Waldrop&#x27;s stories combine elements such as alternative history, American popular culture, the American South, old movies (and character actors), classical mythology, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. His style is sometimes obscure or elliptical: &quot;Night of the Cooters&quot; is a pastiche of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; told from the perspective of a small town Texas sheriff (a homage to Slim Pickens) who faces a Martian cylinder crashing down near his town; &quot;Heirs of the Perisphere&quot; involves robotic Disney characters waking up in the far future; &quot;Fin de Cyclé&quot; describes the Dreyfus affair from the perspective of bicycle enthusiasts.

Waldrop&#x27;s work is frequently out-of-print, though still available for sale online; several of his books have been reprinted in omnibus editions.

Several of his stories have been nominated for the genre&#x27;s awards; &quot;The Ugly Chickens&quot; — about the extinction of the dodo — won a Nebula Award for best novelette in 1980, and also a World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction in 1981; this is perhaps his best known work. In 2021, he won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.

==Film adaptations==
Several of his stories are being adapted to film.

<doc id="89367" wikidata="Q167339" url="?curid=89367" title="Emmer">
<text>Emmer is a hybrid species of wheat, producing edible seeds that have been used as food since ancient times. The domesticated types are &quot;Triticum turgidum&quot; subsp. &quot;dicoccum&quot; and &quot;T. t. &quot;conv.&quot; durum&quot;. The wild plant is called &quot;T. t.&quot; subsp. &quot;dicoccoides&quot;. The seeds have an awned covering, the sharp spikes helping the seeds to become buried in the ground. The principal difference between the wild and the domestic forms is that the ripened seed head of the wild plant shatters and scatters the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for people to harvest the grain.

Along with einkorn, emmer was one of the first crops domesticated in the Near East. It was widely cultivated in the ancient world, but is now a relict crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. Emmer is one of the three grains called farro in Italy.

== Etymology ==

Emmer is first attested in 1908 in English as a loanword from German , variant of , from , &#x27;starch&#x27;, likely from Latin , itself borrowing from Ancient Greek .

== Description ==

Like einkorn (&quot;T. monococcum&quot;) and spelt (&quot;T. spelta&quot;), emmer is a hulled wheat, meaning it has strong glumes (husks) that enclose the grains, and a semibrittle rachis. On threshing, a hulled wheat spike breaks up into spikelets that require milling or pounding to release the grains from the glumes. Wild emmer spikelets effectively self-cultivate by propelling themselves mechanically into soils with their awns. During a period of increased humidity during the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil. During the daytime, the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine silica hairs on the awns act as hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from backing out. During the course of alternating stages of daytime drying and nighttime humidity, the awns&#x27; pumping movements, which resemble a swimming frog kick, will drill the spikelet or more into the soil.

== Evolution ==

=== Taxonomy and phylogeny ===

Strong similarities in morphology and genetics show that wild emmer (&quot;T. dicoccoides&quot; ) is the wild ancestor and a crop wild relative of domesticated emmer. Wild emmer still grows wild in the Near East. It is a tetraploid wheat formed by the hybridization of two diploid wild grasses, wild red einkorn (&quot;Triticum urartu&quot;), and the goatgrass &quot;Aegilops speltoides&quot;.

The botanists Friedrich August Körnicke and Aaron Aaronsohn in the late 19th-century were the first to describe the wild emmer native to Palestine and adjacent countries. Earlier, in 1864, the Austrian botanist Carl Friedrich Kotschy collected specimens of the same wild emmer, without stating where he had collected them. Although cultivated in ancient Egypt, wild emmer has not been grown for human consumption in recent history, perhaps owing to the difficulty with which the chaff is separated from the seed kernels, formerly requiring the spikes to be pounded with mortar and pestle. Wild emmer is distinguished from common wheat by its tougher ear rachis and the beards releasing the grains easily, by their ear rachis becoming brittle when ripe and their firmly fitting beards. Wild emmer grows to a height of , and bears an elongated spike measuring , with long, protruding awns extending upwards. Avni &quot;et al.&quot;, 2017 provides a complete emmer genome.

=== History of cultivation ===

Wild emmer is native to the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, growing in the grass and woodland of hill country from modern-day Israel to Iran. The origin of wild emmer has been suggested, without universal agreement among scholars, to be the Karaca Dağ mountain region of southeastern Turkey. In 1906, Aaron Aaronsohn&#x27;s discovery of wild emmer wheat growing in Rosh Pinna (Israel) created a stir in the botanical world. Emmer wheat has been found in archaeological excavations and ancient tombs. Emmer was collected from the wild and eaten by hunter gatherers for thousands of years before its domestication. Grains of wild emmer discovered at Ohalo II had a radiocarbon dating of 17,000 BC and at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) site of Netiv Hagdud are 10,000–9,400 years old.

The location of the earliest site of emmer domestication is still unclear and under debate. Some of the earliest sites with possible indirect evidence for emmer domestication during the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B include Tell Aswad, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Aşıklı Höyük, and Shillourokambos. Definitive evidence for the full domestication of emmer wheat is not found until the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10,200 to 9,500 BP), at sites such as Beidha, Tell Ghoraifé, Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), Abu Hureyra, Tell Halula, Tell Aswad and Cafer Höyük.

Emmer is found in a large number of Neolithic sites scattered around the fertile crescent. From its earliest days of cultivation, emmer was a more prominent crop than its cereal contemporaries and competitors, einkorn wheat and barley. Small quantities of emmer are present during Period 1 at Mehrgharh on the Indian subcontinent, showing that emmer was already cultivated there by 7000–5000 BC.

In the Near East, in southern Mesopotamia in particular, cultivation of emmer wheat began to decline in the Early Bronze Age, from about 3000 BC, and barley became the standard cereal crop. This has been related to increased salinization of irrigated alluvial soils, of which barley is more tolerant, although this study has been challenged. Emmer had a special place in ancient Egypt, where it was the main wheat cultivated in Pharaonic times, although cultivated einkorn wheat was grown in great abundance during the Third Dynasty, and large quantities of it were found preserved, along with cultivated emmer wheat and barleys, in the subterranean chambers beneath the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Neighbouring countries also cultivated einkorn, durum and common wheat. In the absence of any obvious functional explanation, the greater prevalence of emmer wheat in the diet of ancient Egypt may simply reflect a marked culinary or cultural preference, or may reflect growing conditions having changed after the Third Dynasty. Emmer and barley were the primary ingredients in ancient Egyptian bread and beer. Emmer recovered from the Phoenician settlement at Volubilis (in present-day Morocco) has been dated to the middle of the first millennium BC.

Emmer wheat may be one of the five species of grain which have a special status in Judaism. One of these species may be either emmer or spelt. However, it is fairly certain that spelt did not grow in ancient Israel, and emmer was probably a significant crop until the end of the Iron Age. References to emmer in Greek and Latin texts are traditionally translated as &quot;spelt&quot;, even though spelt was not common in the Classical world until very late in its history.

Pliny the Elder notes that although emmer was called in his time, it had formerly been called (or &#x27;glory&#x27;), providing an etymology explaining that emmer had been held in glory. He mentions its use in sacrifices, stating that it had to be purified by roasting in order to be suitable. He states that in Etruria emmer was first roasted, then crushed either with an iron-capped pestle, or using a handmill that was toothed on the inside. This contrasted, Pliny writes, with the rest of Italy, where either a plain pestle or a watermill was used to make it into flour.

== Cultivation ==

Today emmer is primarily a relict crop in mountainous areas. Its value lies in its ability to give good yields on poor soils, and its resistance to fungal diseases such as stem rust that are prevalent in wet areas. Emmer is grown in Armenia, Morocco, Spain (Asturias), the Carpathian mountains on the border of Czechia and Slovakia, Albania, Turkey, Switzerland, Germany, Greece and Italy. It is grown in the U.S. as a specialty product. In Ethiopia, the grain is traditional.

In Italy, uniquely, emmer cultivation is well established and even expanding. In the mountainous Garfagnana area of Tuscany emmer (one of three grains known as farro) is grown by farmers as an IGP (Indicazione Geografica Protetta) product, with its geographic identity protected by law. The demand for Italian farro has led to competition from non-certified farro, grown in lowland areas and often consisting of a different wheat species, spelt.

==Food uses==

Emmer&#x27;s main use is as food, though it is also used as fodder. Ethnographic evidence from Turkey and other emmer-growing areas suggests that emmer makes good bread (judged by the taste and texture standards of traditional bread); it was widely eaten as bread in ancient Egypt. 
In Armenian cuisine, emmer pilaf is cooked in sunflower oil. The pre-cooked emmer is fried in oil and then sautéed onions are added. In the second version, boiled water and emmer are added to the sautéed onion and then cooked until tender. In Armenia, emmer porridge with lamb called &quot;kashovi&quot; is widespread in the Shirak region, while lean kashovi is known in all regions of Armenia. Chopped lamb is added to cold water then boiled for 10 minutes, emmer and sautéed onion are added and cooked over a low heat until tender.
In Italy, whole emmer grains can be found in most supermarkets and groceries, emmer bread () can be found in bakeries in some areas, while in Tuscany emmer has traditionally been consumed as whole grains in soup. Emmer has been used in beer production.

Emmer has antihyperglycemic properties and antioxidant activity, which could be useful as part of a diet for type 2 diabetes in its early stages. As with all varieties and hybrids of wheat, emmer is unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders, despite the popular claim that ancient grains contain less gluten.

<text>In automata theory, combinational logic (also referred to as time-independent logic) is a type of digital logic that is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only. This is in contrast to sequential logic, in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has &quot;memory&quot; while combinational logic does not.

Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic. For example, the part of an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders are also made by using combinational logic.

Practical design of combinational logic systems may require consideration of the finite time required for practical logical elements to react to changes in their inputs. Where an output is the result of the combination of several different paths with differing numbers of switching elements, the output may momentarily change state before settling at the final state, as the changes propagate along different paths. 

==Representation==
Combinational logic is used to build circuits that produce specified outputs from certain inputs. The construction of combinational logic is generally done using one of two methods: a sum of products, or a product of sums. Consider the following truth table:


Using sum of products, all logical statements which yield true results are summed, giving the result:

: formula_1

Using Boolean algebra, the result simplifies to the following equivalent of the truth table:

: formula_2

==Logic formula minimization==
Minimization (simplification) of combinational logic formulas is done using the following rules based on the laws of Boolean algebra:

: formula_3

: formula_4

: formula_5

: formula_6

: formula_7

With the use of minimization (sometimes called logic optimization), a simplified logical function or circuit may be arrived upon, and the logic combinational circuit becomes smaller, and easier to analyse, use, or build.

<text>MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) is an initiative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to publish all of the educational materials from its undergraduate- and graduate-level courses online, freely and openly available to anyone, anywhere. The project was announced on April 4, 2001, and uses the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. The program was originally funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and MIT. MIT OpenCourseWare is supported by MIT, corporate underwriting, major gifts, and donations from site visitors. The initiative inspired a number of other institutions to make their course materials available as open educational resources.

As of May 2018, over 2,400 courses were available online. While a few of these were limited to chronological reading lists and discussion topics, a majority provided homework problems and exams (often with solutions) and lecture notes. Some courses also included interactive web demonstrations in Java, complete textbooks written by MIT professors, and streaming video lectures. As of May 2018, 100 courses included complete video lectures. The videos were available in streaming mode, but could also be downloaded for viewing offline. All video and audio files were also available from YouTube, iTunes U and the Internet Archive.

==Project==
MIT OpenCourseWare sits within MIT Open Learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===History===
The concept of MIT OpenCourseWare grew out of the MIT Council on Education Technology, which was charged by MIT provost Robert Brown in 1999 with determining how MIT should position itself in the distance learning/e-learning environment. MIT OpenCourseWare was then initiated to provide a new model for the dissemination of knowledge and collaboration among scholars around the world, and contributes to the “shared intellectual commons” in academia, which fosters collaboration across MIT and among other scholars. The project was spearheaded by professors Dick K.P Yue, Shigeru Miyagawa, and Hal Abelson. The main challenge in implementing the MIT OCW initiative had not been faculty resistance, but rather, the logistical challenges presented by determining ownership and obtaining publication permission for the massive amount of copyrighted items that are embedded in the course materials of MIT&#x27;s faculty, in addition to the time and technical effort required to convert the educational materials to an online format. Copyright in MIT OpenCourseWare material remains with MIT, members of its faculty, or its students.

In September 2002, the MIT OpenCourseWare proof-of-concept pilot site opened to the public, offering 32 courses. In September 2003, MIT OpenCourseWare published its 500th course, including some courses with complete streaming video lectures. By September 2004, 900 MIT courses were available online. In 2005, MIT OpenCourseWare and other open educational resources projects formed the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which seeks to extend the reach and impact of open course materials, foster new open course materials and develop sustainable models for open course material publication. In 2007, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced a site called Highlights for High School that indexes resources on the MIT OCW applicable to advanced high school study in biology, chemistry, calculus and physics in an effort to support US STEM education at the secondary school level. In 2011, MIT OpenCourseWare introduced the first of fifteen OCW Scholar courses, which are designed specifically for the needs of independent learners. While still publications of course materials like the rest of the site content, these courses are more in-depth and the materials are presented in logical sequences that facilitate self-study. No interaction with other students is supported by the OCW site, but study groups on collaborating project OpenStudy are available for some OCW Scholar courses. In 2012, Harvard and MIT launched edX, a massive open online course (MOOC) provider to deliver online learning opportunities to the public. Between 2013 and 2019, some MIT OCW courses were delivered by the European MOOC platform Eliademy.

In recent years, MIT OCW has expanded its reach and features. As of 2020, the platform reported an increase in global engagement, with materials accessed by over 500 million learners worldwide since its inception. 

===Technology===
MIT OCW was originally served by a custom content management system based on Microsoft&#x27;s Content Management Server, which was replaced in mid-2010 with a Plone-based content management system. The publishing process is described by MIT as a &quot;large-scale digital publishing infrastructure&quot; that consists of planning tools, a content management system (CMS), and the MIT OpenCourseWare content distribution infrastructure. Video content for the courses was originally primarily in RealMedia format.

In 2008, OCW transitioned to using YouTube as the primary digital video streaming platform for the site, embedding YouTube video back into the OCW site. OCW video and audio files are also provided in full for offline downloads on iTunesU and the Internet Archive. In 2011, OCW introduced an iPhone app called LectureHall in partnership with Irynsoft. 
===Funding===
As of 2013, the annual cost of running MIT OCW was about $3.5 million. In 2011, &quot;MIT&#x27;s goal for the next decade [was] to increase our reach ten-fold&quot; and to secure funding for this.

<doc id="89374" wikidata="Q173245" url="?curid=89374" title="Sequential logic">
<text>In automata theory, sequential logic is a type of logic circuit whose output depends on the present value of its input signals and on the sequence of past inputs, the input history. This is in contrast to &quot;combinational logic&quot;, whose output is a function of only the present input. That is, sequential logic has &quot;state&quot; (&quot;memory&quot;) while combinational logic does not.

Sequential logic is used to construct finite-state machines, a basic building block in all digital circuitry. Virtually all circuits in practical digital devices are a mixture of combinational and sequential logic.

A familiar example of a device with sequential logic is a television set with &quot;channel up&quot; and &quot;channel down&quot; buttons. Pressing the &quot;up&quot; button gives the television an input telling it to switch to the next channel above the one it is currently receiving. If the television is on channel 5, pressing &quot;up&quot; switches it to receive channel 6. However, if the television is on channel 8, pressing &quot;up&quot; switches it to channel &quot;9&quot;. In order for the channel selection to operate correctly, the television must be aware of which channel it is currently receiving, which was determined by past channel selections. The television stores the current channel as part of its &quot;state&quot;. When a &quot;channel up&quot; or &quot;channel down&quot; input is given to it, the sequential logic of the channel selection circuitry calculates the new channel from the input and the current channel.

Digital sequential logic circuits are divided into synchronous and asynchronous types. In synchronous sequential circuits, the state of the device changes only at discrete times in response to a clock signal. In asynchronous circuits the state of the device can change at any time in response to changing inputs.

== Synchronous sequential logic ==
Nearly all sequential logic today is &quot;clocked&quot; or &quot;synchronous&quot; logic. In a synchronous circuit, an electronic oscillator called a &quot;clock&quot; (or clock generator) generates a sequence of repetitive pulses called the &quot;clock signal&quot; which is distributed to all the memory elements in the circuit. The basic memory element in synchronous logic is the flip-flop. The output of each flip-flop only changes when triggered by the clock pulse, so changes to the logic signals throughout the circuit all begin at the same time, at regular intervals, synchronized by the clock. 
The output of all the storage elements (flip-flops) in the circuit at any given time, the binary data they contain, is called the &quot;state&quot; of the circuit. The state of the synchronous circuit only changes on clock pulses. At each cycle, the next state is determined by the current state and the value of the input signals when the clock pulse occurs.

The main advantage of synchronous logic is its simplicity. The logic gates which perform the operations on the data require a finite amount of time to respond to changes to their inputs. This is called &quot;propagation delay&quot;. The interval between clock pulses must be long enough so that all the logic gates have time to respond to the changes and their outputs &quot;settle&quot; to stable logic values before the next clock pulse occurs. As long as this condition is met (ignoring certain other details) the circuit is guaranteed to be stable and reliable. This determines the maximum operating speed of the synchronous circuit.

Synchronous logic has two main disadvantages:

* The maximum possible clock rate is determined by the slowest logic path in the circuit, otherwise known as the critical path. Every logical calculation, from the simplest to the most complex, must complete in one clock cycle. So logic paths that complete their calculations quickly are idle much of the time, waiting for the next clock pulse. Therefore, synchronous logic can be slower than asynchronous logic. One way to speed up synchronous circuits is to split complex operations into several simple operations which can be performed in successive clock cycles, a technique known as &quot;pipelining&quot;. This technique is extensively used in microprocessor design and helps to improve the performance of modern processors.
* The clock signal must be distributed to every flip-flop in the circuit. As the clock is usually a high-frequency signal, this distribution consumes a relatively large amount of power and dissipates much heat. Even the flip-flops that are doing nothing consume a small amount of power, thereby generating waste heat in the chip. In battery-powered devices, additional hardware and software complexity is required to reduce the clock speed or temporarily turn off the clock while the device is not being actively used, in order to maintain a usable battery life.

==Asynchronous sequential logic==

&quot;Asynchronous&quot; (&quot;clockless&quot; or &quot;self-timed&quot;) &quot;sequential logic&quot; is not synchronized by a clock signal; the outputs of the circuit change directly in response to changes in inputs. The advantage of asynchronous logic is that it can be faster than synchronous logic, because the circuit doesn&#x27;t have to wait for a clock signal to process inputs. The speed of the device is potentially limited only by the propagation delays of the logic gates used.

However, asynchronous logic is more difficult to design and is subject to problems not encountered in synchronous designs. The main problem is that digital memory elements are sensitive to the order that their input signals arrive; if two signals arrive at a flip-flop or latch at almost the same time, which state the circuit goes into can depend on which signal gets to the gate first. Therefore, the circuit can go into the wrong state, depending on small differences in the propagation delays of the logic gates. This is called a race condition. This problem is not as severe in synchronous circuits because the outputs of the memory elements only change at each clock pulse. The interval between clock signals is designed to be long enough to allow the outputs of the memory elements to &quot;settle&quot; so they are not changing when the next clock comes. Therefore, the only timing problems are due to &quot;asynchronous inputs&quot;; inputs to the circuit from other systems which are not synchronized to the clock signal.

Asynchronous sequential circuits are typically used only in a few critical parts of otherwise synchronous systems where speed is at a premium, such as parts of microprocessors and digital signal processing circuits.

The design of asynchronous logic uses different mathematical models and techniques from synchronous logic, and is an active area of research.

<doc id="89388" wikidata="Q71483" url="?curid=89388" title="Trillian (software)">
<text>Trillian is a proprietary multiprotocol instant messaging application created by Cerulean Studios. It is currently available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, and the Web. It can connect to multiple IM services, such as AIM, Bonjour, Facebook Messenger, Google Talk (Hangouts), IRC, XMPP (Jabber), VZ, and Yahoo! Messenger networks; as well as social networking sites, such as Facebook, Foursquare, LinkedIn, and Twitter; and email services, such as POP3 and IMAP.

Trillian no longer supports Windows Live Messenger or Skype as these services have combined and Microsoft chose to discontinue Skypekit that was used for connection. They also no longer support connecting to MySpace, or a distinct connection for Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail although these can still be connected to via POP3 or IMAP. Currently, Trillian supports Facebook, Google, Jabber (XMPP), and Olark.

Initially released July 1, 2000, as a freeware IRC client, the first commercial version &quot;(Trillian Pro 1.0)&quot; was published on September 10, 2002. The program was named after Trillian, a fictional character in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams. A previous version of the official web site even had a tribute to Douglas Adams on its front page. On August 14, 2009, Trillian &quot;Astra&quot; (4.0) for Windows was released, along with its own Astra network. Trillian 5 for Windows was released in May 2011, and Trillian 6.0 was initially released in February 2017.

== Features ==

=== Connection to multiple IM services ===
Trillian connects to multiple instant messaging services without the need of running multiple clients. Users can create multiple connections to the same service, and can also group connections under separate identities to prevent confusion. All contacts are gathered under the same contact list. Contacts are not bound to their own IM service groups, and can be dragged and dropped freely. Trillian represents each service with a different-colored sphere. Prior versions used the corporate logos for each service, but these were removed to avoid copyright issues, although some skins still use the original icons. The Trillian designers chose a color-coding scheme based on the underground maps used by the London Underground that uses different colors to differentiate between different lines.

==== IM services ====
* Green And Blue for Trillian Astra Network
* Grey for IRC
* Amber and Dark Gray for Bonjour (Rendezvous)
* Purple for Jabber/XMPP (partially broken as of 10/27/2017)
* Teal and Amber for Google Talk (discontinued as of 2022)
* Blue And Teal for Facebook (discontinued as of 2022)
* Blue for MSN Messenger (discontinued as of 2013)
* Green for ICQ (discontinued as of 2017)
* Amber for AOL Instant Messenger (discontinued as of 2017)

==== Mail services ====
* A White Envelope for POP emails
* a Manila Envelope for IMAP emails
* a Teal Envelope for Twitter

Prior versions of Trillian supported:
* Microsoft Exchange
* Lotus Sametime
* Novell GroupWise Messenger

=== Metacontact ===
To eliminate duplicates and simplify the structure of the contact list, users can bundle multiple contact entries for the same person into one entry in the contact list, using the Metacontact feature (similarly to Ayttm&#x27;s fallback messaging feature). Subcontacts will appear under the metacontact as small icons aligned in a manner of a tree.

=== Activity history ===

Trillian Pro comes with Activity History, and both log the history as both plain text files and as XML files. Pro has a History Manager that shows the chat history and allows the user to add bookmarks for revision later on. XML-based history makes the log easy to manipulate, searchable and extendable for future functions.

=== Stream manipulation ===
Trillian Pro also has a stream manipulation feature labelled &#x27;time travel&#x27;, which allows the user to record, and subsequently review, pause, rewind, and fast forward live video and audio sessions.

=== SecureIM ===
SecureIM is an encryption system built into the Trillian Instant Messenger Client.

It encrypts messages from user to user, so no passively observing node between the two is supposedly able to read the encrypted messages. SecureIM does &quot;not&quot; authenticate its messages, and therefore it is susceptible to active attacks including simple forms of man-in-the-middle attacks.

According to Cerulean Studios, the makers of Trillian, SecureIM enciphers messages with 128-bit Blowfish encryption. It only works with the OSCAR protocol and if both chat partners use Trillian.

However, the key used for encryption is established using a Diffie–Hellman key exchange which only uses a 128 bit prime number as modulus, which is extremely insecure and can be broken within minutes on a standard PC.

=== Instant lookup ===
Starting with version 3.0 in both the Basic and Pro suites, Trillian makes use of the English-language version of the Wikipedia free online encyclopedia for real-time referencing using its database of free knowledge. The feature is employed directly within a conversation window of a user. When one or more words are entered (by either user), Trillian checks all words against a database file and if a match is found, the word appears with a dotted green underline. When users point their mouse over the word, the lead paragraph of the corresponding article is downloaded from Wikipedia and displayed on screen as a tooltip. When users click on the underlined word, they are given the choice to visit the article online.

=== Emotiblips ===
Emotiblips are the video equivalent of an emoticon. During video sessions, the user may stream a song or video to the other user in real time. One can send MP3s, WAVs, WMVs, and MPGs with this feature. QuickTime MOV files as Emotiblips are not currently supported.

=== Hidden smileys ===
In version 2.0 to the current, the default emoticon set contains emoticons that don&#x27;t appear in the menu but can be used in conversations. Some of these are animations that can only be viewed in Trillian Pro, but all of them can be used regardless.

=== Skins and interfaces (Discontinued) ===
Trillian has its own unique skinning engine known as &quot;SkinXML&quot;. Many skins have been developed for Trillian and they can be downloaded from the official skins gallery or deviantArt.

Trillian also came with an easier skinning language, &quot;Stixe&quot;, which is essentially a set of XML Entities that simplifies repetitive codes and allows skinners to share XML and graphics in the form of emoticon packs, sound packs and interfaces.

The default skins of Trillian are designed by Madelena Mak. Trillian Cordillera was used in &quot;Trillian 0.7x&quot;, while Trillian Whistler has been the default skin for Trillian since Pro 1.0. Small cosmetic changes were noticeable in each major release.

The &quot;Trillian Astra&quot; features a brand new design for the front-end UI, named Trillian Cordonata.

=== Plugins (Discontinued) ===
Trillian is a closed-source application, but the Pro version can be extended by plugins. Plugins by Cerulean Studios itself include spell-check, weather monitor, a mini-browser (for viewing AIM profiles), Winamp song title scroller, stock exchange monitor, RSS feedreader, and conversation abilities for the Logitech G15 keyboard, as well as a plug-in for the XMPP and Bonjour networks. Others have developed various plug-ins, such as a &quot;games&quot; plug-in which can be used to play chess and checkers, a protocol plugin to send NetBIOS messages through Trillian, a plug-in to interact with Lotus Sametime clients, a plug-in to interact with Microsoft Exchange, a POP3 and IMAP email checker, or an automatic translator for many European languages to and from English.

Trillian 5.1 for Windows and later included a plug-in that allows you to chat and make calls on Skype without Skype being installed. As of July 2014, Skype is no longer accessible from the Trillian client, as the Skype plug-in no longer works (some had been able to use older versions of the Trillian client, but now these also no longer work with Skype.)

Plugins are available for free and are hosted on the official web site, but most need Trillian Pro 2+ to run.

=== In-Game Chat ===
Starting at version 5.3, Trillian users can toggle an overlay when playing a video game on the computer that allows the user to use Trillian&#x27;s chat features, in a similar vein to Steam&#x27;s overlay chat. When toggled, the overlay will show the time according to the system&#x27;s clock, and the chat window itself is a variation Trillian&#x27;s base chat window, with tabs used for different sets of queries and channels. Also, when the overlay is not activated, users can view a toggle-able sticker that tells the user how many messages are unread.

== History ==
=== Early beginnings ===
After several internal builds, the first ever public release of Trillian, version &quot;0.50&quot;, was available on July 1, 2000, and was designed to be an IRC client. The release was deemed &#x27;too buggy&#x27; and was immediately pulled off the shelf and replaced by a new version &quot;0.51&quot; on the same day. It featured a simple Connection Manager and skinned windows.

A month later, two minor builds were released with additional IRC features and bug fixes. Despite these efforts, Trillian was not popular, as reflected in the number of downloads from CNET&#x27;s Download.com.

Trillian was a donateware at that time. They used PayPal for receiving donations through their web site.

=== Introduction of interoperability ===
Version &quot;0.6&quot;, released November 29, 2000, represented a major change in the direction of development, when the client became able to connect to AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ and MSN Messenger simultaneously in one window.

Although similar products, such as Odigo and Imici, already existed, Trillian was novel in the way that it distinguished contacts from different IM services clearly on the contact list, and it did not require registration of a proprietary account. It also did not lose connection easily like the other clients.

A month later, Yahoo! Messenger support was introduced in Trillian &quot;0.61&quot;, and it also featured a holiday skin for Christmas. Meanwhile, the Trillian community forums were opened to the public.

During this period, new versions were released frequently, attracting many enthusiasts to the community. Skinning activity boomed and fan sites were created. A skinning contest was held on deviantArt in Summer, and the winner was selected to design the default skin for the next version of Trillian. Trillian hit 100,000 downloads on August 14, 2001.

=== Entry into mainstream and the &quot;IM Wars&quot; ===
Contrary to the anticipation for version &quot;0.64&quot; in the community, the next version of Trillian was numbered &quot;0.70&quot;. It was released December 5, 2001. Development took five months, considerably longer than development of prior builds.

The new version implemented file transfer in all IM services, a feature most requested by the community at the time. It also represented a number of skin language changes. It used the contact list as the main window (as opposed to a status window &#x27;container&#x27; in prior versions) and featured a brand new default skin, &quot;Trillian Cordillera&quot;, and an emoticon set boasting over 100 emoticons, setting a record apart from other messengers available at that time.

Version &quot;0.71&quot; was released on December 18, 2001. It supported AIM group chats and was the first major IM client which included the ability to encrypt messages with SecureIM.

In the following months, the number of downloads of Trillian surged, reaching 1 million on 27 January 2002, and 5 million within 6 months. Trillian received coverage and favorable reviews from mainstream media worldwide, particularly by CNET, &quot;Wired&quot; and BetaNews. The lead developer and co-founder, Scott Werndorfer, was also interviewed on TechTV.

AOL became aware that Trillian users were able to chat with their AIM buddies without having to download the AIM client, and on January 28, 2002, AOL blocked SecureIM access from Trillian clients. Cerulean appeared to have circumvented the block with version &quot;0.721&quot; of its client software, released one day later. This &quot;AOL War&quot; continued for the next couple of weeks, with Cerulean releasing subsequent patches &quot;0.722&quot;, &quot;0.723&quot; and &quot;0.724&quot;.

Trillian appeared in the Jupiter Media Metrix Internet audience ratings in February 2002 with 344,000 unique users, and grew to 610,000 by April 2002. While those numbers are very small compared to the major IM networks, Jupiter said Trillian consistently ranks highest according to the number of average minutes spent per month.

Trillian also created a special version for Iomega ActiveDisk.

=== Commercialisation with Trillian Pro ===
On September 9, 2002, a commercial version, &quot;Trillian Pro 1.0&quot;, was released concurrently with &quot;Trillian Basic 0.74&quot;. The commercial version was sold for $25 US for a year of subscription, but all those who donated to the development of Trillian before were eligible to a year of subscription at no cost.

The new version had added SMS and mobile messaging abilities, Yahoo! Messenger webcam support, pop-up e-mail alerts and new plug-ins to shuttle news, weather and stock quotes directly to buddy lists.

It appeared Trillian Pro would be marketed to corporate clients looking to keep in touch with suppliers or customers via a secured, interoperable IM network, and a relatively stern user interface. The company had no venture capital backing, and had depended entirely on donations from users to stay alive.

Trillian Pro 1.0 was nominated and picked among three other nominees as the Best Internet Communication shareware in its debut year of being a &quot;try before you buy&quot; shareware.

On April 26, 2003, total downloads of Trillian reached ten million.

=== Blocking from Yahoo! and cooperation with Gaim ===
A few weeks after &quot;Trillian Pro 2.0&quot; was released, Yahoo! attempted to block Trillian from connecting to its service in their &quot;efforts to implement preventative measures to protect our users from potential spammers.&quot; A few patches were released by the Trillian developers, which resolved the issue.

The Trillian developers assisted its open-source cross-platform rival Gaim in solving the Yahoo! connection issues. Sean Egan, the developer of Gaim, posted in its site, &quot;Our friends over at Cerulean Studios managed to break my speed record at cracking Yahoo! authentication schemes with an impressive feat of hackery. They sent it over and here it is in Gaim 0.70.&quot; It was later revealed that the developers were friends and had helped each other on past occasions.

Meanwhile, as Microsoft forced its users to upgrade to MSN Messenger 5.0 for upgrades in their servers for security issues, October 15, 2003 also would mark the deadline for Trillian support for MSN Messenger. However, it appeared that Cerulean Studios worked with Microsoft to resolve the issue on August 2, 2003, long before the deadline.

On March 7, 2004, and June 23, 2004, Yahoo! changed its instant messaging language again to prevent third-party services, such as Trillian, from accessing its service. Like prior statements, the company said the block is meant as a pre-emptive measure against spammers. Cerulean Studios released a few patches to fix the issues within a day or two.

=== Trillian 3 Series ===

In August 2004, a new official blog was created in attempt to rebuild connections between the Studios and its customers. Trillian 3 was announced in the blog, and a sneak preview was made available to a small group of testers.

After months of beta-testing, the final build of Trillian 3 was released on December 18, 2004, with features such as new video and audio chat abilities throughout AIM, MSN Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger, an enhanced logging manager and integration with the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. It also featured a clean and re-organized user interface and a brand new official web site.

The release also updated the long-abandoned &quot;Trillian Basic .74&quot; to match the new user interface and functionalities as &quot;Trillian Basic 3.0&quot;. The number of accumulated downloads of Trillian Basic in Download.com hit 20 million within a matter of weeks.

&quot;Trillian 3.1&quot; was released February 23, 2005. It included new features such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and multiple identities support.

On June 10, 2011, all instances of Trillian 3 Basic got an automatic upgrade to Trillian 3 Pro, free of charge.

=== U3 and Google Pack ===
A version of Trillian that could run on U3 USB flash drives was released on October 21, 2005. Trillian could previously be run from generic flash drives or other storage devices with some minor unofficial modifications, known as &quot;Trillian Anywhere&quot;. A U3 version of Trillian Astra is also posted on the official Cerulean Studios forum.

On January 6, 2006, Larry Page, President of Products at Google, announced Google Pack, a bundle of various applications including &quot;Trillian Basic 3.0&quot; as &quot;a free collection of safe, useful software from Google and other companies that improves the user experience online and on the desktop&quot;.

According to the Cerulean Studios blog, Trillian was discontinued from Google Pack on 19 May 2006.

The inclusion of Trillian in Google Pack was perplexing to some media analysts as Google had at the time its own Google Talk service which touted the benefits of an open IM system. The free Trillian Basic client could not be used with Google Talk, however, the paid Trillian Pro was listed as one of the &quot;client choices&quot; in the Google Talk client choices list until Google Talk was replaced by Google Hangouts in May 2013.

=== Trillian Astra (Trillian 4) ===

More than a year after the release of &quot;Trillian 3.1&quot;, the Cerulean Studios blog began spreading news again and announced the next version of Trillian, to be named &quot;Trillian Astra&quot;. The name for version 4, &quot;Astra&quot;, is the nickname used by the same fictional character that is the namesake of the software, which is a reference to The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy. The new release claimed to be faster and include a new login screen. A new domain, www.trillianastra.com, was disclosed to the public, with only the logo and blue background. On July 3, 2009, Cerulean Studios reopened the premium web version of Astra to public testing. On August 14, 2009, Cerulean Studios released the final gold build. Trillian has its own social network named Astra Network, in which users who have Astra ID can communicate with each other on the network regardless of platform. Cerulean Studios later registered a new domain, www.trillian.im, to provide a more user-friendly experience.

On November 18, 2009, the first mobile version of Trillian was launched for iPhone. As of 2010, final builds for Android, BlackBerry, and Apple iOS were available for their markets (Market, App World and App Store respectively). Trillian initially cost US$4.99 but became free of charge, supported by ads, in 2011.

As of August 2010, the Mac OS X version was in beta testing.

=== Trillian 5 ===
On August 2, 2010, Trillian 5.0 was released as a public beta. Newer features included a resize-able interface, History synchronization, a new ribbon inspired interface with Windows theme integration, new &quot;marble-like&quot; icons for service providers, the option to revert to the Trillian 3 &amp; 4 interfaces, and a new social network interface window were introduced. Along with Trillian 5.0 For Windows and the aforementioned Mac beta. As of 2010, the Android and BlackBerry OS final builds were available on their respective markets for free.

==== OpenCandy ====
Included with the installation of Trillian 5.0 was a program called OpenCandy, which some security programs, including Microsoft Security Essentials, classed as adware. OpenCandy was removed shortly after on May 5, 2011.

=== Trillian 6 ===
On January 8, 2016, Trillian 6 was released.

=== Loss of networks ===
Trillian has stopped attempting to work around the systems to make their client work with other networks. They have also not done any development to integrate support for any of the newer networks. Instead they urge people to use their own IM service instead.

<text>A Bridge Too Far is a 1977 epic war film directed by Richard Attenborough. It depicts Operation Market Garden, a failed Allied operation in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II; the film&#x27;s screenplay, by William Goldman, is based on a book of the same title by historian Cornelius Ryan. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Krüger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann.

Independently produced by Richard and Joseph E. Levine, it was the second film based on a book by Ryan to be adapted for the screen (after &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962)). It was the second film based on the events of Operation Market Garden, following &quot;Theirs Is the Glory&quot; (1946). A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film was shot on location in the Netherlands, in many of the real locations where the historical events took place.

Although released to a tepid critical response, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; received several awards. At the 31st BAFTA Awards it won four out of eight nominated categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Edward Fox and Best Score for John Addison—who himself had served in the British XXX Corps during Market Garden. Attenborough was nominated for Best Direction, and the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture. It was a success at the box office, becoming the sixth-most popular movie of 1977.

==Plot==
Operation Market Garden involves 35,000 men being flown from airfields in England and dropped behind enemy lines in the Netherlands. Two divisions of US paratroopers are responsible for securing the road and bridges as far as Nijmegen. A British division, under Major-General Roy Urquhart, is to land near Arnhem and hold the bridge there, backed by a brigade of Polish paratroopers under General Stanisław Sosabowski. XXX Armoured Corps is to push up the road over the captured bridges and reach Arnhem within two days.

As Major-General Urquhart briefs his officers, some are surprised that they are going to attempt a landing so far from their objectives. Although the consensus is that resistance will consist entirely of inexperienced old men and Hitler Youth, reconnaissance photos show German tanks at Arnhem. General Browning nevertheless dismisses the photos and ignores reports from the Dutch underground.

The Arnhem bridge is the prime target, as the last means of escape for the German forces in the Netherlands and it is a direct route to Germany. However the road to it is only a single lane linking the key bridges, and vehicles have to squeeze onto the verge to pass. The road is also elevated, causing anything moving along it to stand out.

Although the airborne drops surprise the enemy and meet little resistance, the Son bridge is demolished by the Germans just before it can be secured. Furthermore, many of the jeeps either do not arrive or are destroyed in an ambush, in addition to their nonfunctional radio sets.

Meanwhile, XXX Corps&#x27;s progress is slowed by German resistance, the narrowness of the road, and the need to construct a Bailey bridge to replace the bridge at Son. They are halted at Nijmegen, where soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division perform a daylight crossing to capture the Nijmegen bridge, and XXX Corps is further delayed waiting for infantry to secure the town.

The Germans close in on the isolated British paratroopers occupying Arnhem near the bridge, and although Sosabowski&#x27;s troops finally arrive after being delayed in England they are too late to reinforce the British. After days of intense fighting against SS infantry and panzers the outgunned troops are either captured or forced to withdraw to Oosterbeek. Urquhart receives orders to retreat, while the other Allied commanders blame the various difficulties encountered for their failure to provide support.

Urquhart escapes with less than a fifth of his original 10,000 troops while those who are too badly injured to flee stay behind to cover the withdrawal. At British headquarters, Urquhart confronts Browning about his personal sentiments regarding the operation and the latter contradicts his earlier optimism.

Back in Oosterbeek Kate ter Horst, whose home has been converted into a makeshift hospital by the British, abandons its ruins. Passing through the front yard, now a graveyard for fallen troops, she and her children leave with an elderly doctor, pulling a few possessions in a cart, while wounded British troops sing &quot;Abide with Me&quot; as they await capture.

==Production==
Air filming was done in the first weeks of September 1976, culminating in a series of air drops of a total of 1,000 men. Supplies were dropped from a number of Dakota aircraft. The Dakotas were gathered by the film company Joseph E. Levine Presents Incorporated. All aircraft were required to be CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) or FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) registered and licensed to carry passengers. An original deal for the purchase of 10 fell through when two airframes were rejected as passenger configured without the necessary jump doors. 

Eleven Dakotas were procured. Two ex-Portuguese Air Force, 6153 and 6171 (N9984Q and N9983Q), and two from Air Djibouti, operating from Djibouti in French Somaliland, F-OCKU and F-OCKX (N9985Q and N9986Q) were purchased by Joseph E. Levine. Three Danish Air Force K-685, K-687, and K-688, and four Finnish Air Force C-47s, DO-4, DO-7, DO-10 and DO-12, were loaned for the duration of the parachute filming.

Aircraft 6171 doubled as the camera ship on most formations, with a camouflaged Piper Aztec, G-AWDI. A camera was mounted in the astrodome, one on the port upper mainplane surface, with a third camera on the outside of the forward port cabin window and a fourth under the aircraft centre section. In addition, centre escape hatches were removed to make additional camera ports available, provided that no troops were aboard during filming. A second Aztec, G-ASND, was a backup camera ship on some shots, but it was not camouflaged. An Alouette, G-BDWN, was also employed. After a mishap with G-AWDI, two locally hired Cessna 172s, PH-GVP and PH-ADF, were also used. Ten Horsa glider replicas were built, but a windstorm damaged almost all of them. Seven or eight were hastily repaired for the shoot. 

The replica gliders were tail-heavy and required a support post under the rear fuselage, with camera angles carefully chosen to avoid revealing this. Dakota 6153 was fitted with tow gear and Horsa replicas were towed at high speed, though none went airborne. A two-seat Blaník sailplane, provided by a member of the London Gliding Club, Dunstable, was towed aloft for the interior takeoff shots.
Four Harvards portrayed American and German fighters. Their original identities were PH-KLU, PH-BKT, B-64 and B-118, the former two aircraft loaned by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. These were flown by members of the &quot;Gilze Rijen Aero Club&quot;, which also provided an Auster III, PH-NGK, which depicted an Auster V, RT607, in wartime camouflage. Spitfire Mk. IX, MH434, depicting a photo reconnaissance variant, coded AC-S, was lent by the Hon. Patrick Lindsay, and was flown by aerobatic champion Neil Williams.

Sufficient American tanks, jeeps, and trucks of World War II vintage were found because many of the vehicles were being discarded from European military (almost entirely reserve) units, especially from Greece and Turkey.

The scenes set around the Arnhem bridge were shot in Deventer, where a similar bridge over the IJssel was still available. Although a replica of the original road bridge in Arnhem existed, by the mid-1970s modern urban development surrounded it, making it impossible to use as a setting for a 1940s city. A few scenes were shot in Zutphen, where the old municipality house and the main church can be seen. Additional scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios.

The Motion Picture Association of America initially gave the film an R rating for its use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; and depictions of war violence, but United Artists lobbied it to change it to a PG rating so that younger audiences could see the film. Cuts were also made to the film when released in the United Kingdom to avoid an AA rating from the British Board of Film Censors.

==Finance==
In order to keep costs down, all the star-name actors agreed to participate on a &quot;favoured-nation&quot; basis (i.e. they would all receive the same weekly fee), which in this case was $250,000 per week (the 2012 equivalent of $1,008,250 or £642,000).

Shooting of the American-led assault on the Bridge at Nijmegen was dubbed the &quot;Million-Dollar Hour&quot;. Because of heavy traffic, the crew had permission to film on the bridge only between eight and nine o&#x27;clock on October 3, 1976. Failure to complete the scene would have necessitated rescheduling at a cost—including Redford&#x27;s overtime—of at least a million dollars. For this reason, Attenborough insisted that all actors playing corpses keep their eyes closed.

After United Artists agreed to pay $6 million for US and Canada distribution rights, the film went on to become the sixth-most popular movie at the 1977 US box office.

==Reception==
The film received a favourable, but tepid response from critics. Critics agreed that the film was impressively staged and historically accurate, although many found it too long and too repetitive. On Rotten Tomatoes, 59% of 29 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.1/10. Its critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; is a war movie too long, although top-notch talent on both sides of the camera keeps the end result consistently watchable.&quot; According to Metacritic, the film received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews based on a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 from 13 critics.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said further, &quot;The movie is massive, shapeless, often unexpectedly moving, confusing, sad, vivid and very, very long.&quot; 
James Caan and Anthony Hopkins were cited by many critics for the excellence of their performances in a film with hundreds of speaking roles and cameos by many of the period&#x27;s top actors.
Generals Urquhart and Horrocks acted as military advisers to the film, adding to its historical accuracy. However, some reviewers suggested that the film contains historical inaccuracies and needs to be viewed as a &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; interpretation of events. Robin Neillands commented, &quot;A countless number of veterans have urged me to ignore most of the story in the film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;&quot;.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote &quot;A picture of conventional length on this subject might have scored some conventional ironies. But why did anyone think that a film about a failed WWII operation, without any novelty of information or deepening of history or even differently spectacular action, should run five minutes less than three hours? A Film Too Long&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four, describing it as 
Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half out of four and wrote, John Pym of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;by the end of this extravagant film, we have a fair idea of the who-did-what logistics of a costly military operation. The root problem with &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, however, is that the top-heavy complement of stars never allows for any focus of attention.&quot;
Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, 
Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;an unusually conscientious and impressive war epic&quot; that justified its high budget... 

A &quot;making-of&quot; documentary included in a special edition DVD of &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; says that, at the time of its release, &quot;the film was shunned by American critics and completely ignored at Oscar time for daring to expose the fatal inadequacies of the Allied campaign&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Promotion==

To promote the film, scriptwriter William Goldman wrote a book titled &quot;Story of A Bridge Too Far&quot; as a favour to Joseph E. Levine. It was published in December 1977 and divided into three sections:
#&quot;Reflections on Filmmaking in General and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;&quot;. This section features some essays later reprinted in Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;.
#&quot;&quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;: The Story in Pictures&quot; – 150 sequential photographs from the film with Goldman&#x27;s captions.
#&quot;Stars and Heroes&quot; – some of the movie&#x27;s actors and the men they play tell Goldman their thoughts on the film and the battle.

<text>iCab is a web browser for MacOS and Classic Mac OS by Alexander Clauss, derived from Crystal Atari Browser (CAB) for Atari TOS compatible computers. It was one of the few browsers still updated for the classic Mac OS prior to that version being discontinued after version 3.0.5 in 2008; Classilla was the last browser that was maintained for that OS but it was discontinued in 2021.

The downloadable product is fully functional, but is nagware—periodically displaying a dialog box asking the user to register the product, and upgrade to the &quot;Pro&quot; version.

== Versions ==

iCab 2.9.9 supports both 68k and PowerPC Macintosh systems running System 7.5 through Mac OS 9.2.2. While no longer maintained, iCab 2.9.9 is still available for download and registration.

iCab 2.9.8 runs natively on early versions of Mac OS X, but Mac OS X compatible versions of iCab 2.x are no longer officially available for download.

iCab 3.x can run on PowerPC systems running Mac OS 8.5 through Mac OS 9.2.2, or PowerPC or Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.1 or later. iCab 3 was last updated in January 2008.

iCab 4 was rewritten to use the Cocoa API and the WebKit rendering engine. It can run on PowerPC or Intel systems running Mac OS 10.3.9 or later.

iCab 5 was released on June 12, 2012. It runs on Mac OS 10.5 or later.

iCab 6 was rewritten using the new technologies in macOS Big Sur and released on October 31, 2020. It runs on macOS 10.13 or later.

== History ==

iCab was introduced in 1999. The first versions of iCab were criticized for not supporting CSS and DOM, but were given praise for making it easier to navigate to links listed on pages. iCab 3 introduced improved rendering capabilities, including support for CSS2 and Unicode (via the ATSUI toolkit). iCab 4 switched to WebKit for its rendering engine, giving it the same rendering abilities as Apple&#x27;s Safari browser.

On 7 June 2009, iCab 4.6, using the WebKit rendering engine, became the first desktop browser released to display a score of 100/100 and pass the Acid3 test. Apple&#x27;s Safari 4 browser was released one day later and has been officially credited as being the first official release browser to pass the Acid3 test with a score of 100/100.

== Features ==

iCab features a filter manager which allows users to avoid downloading advertisements and other content. Currently iCab comes with two filters (advertisements and video). Other kinds of filters add features, such as the YouTube video filter which adds a download link on all YouTube page views.

iCab has features for website developers, including an HTML validity checker, an automatic page refresh option, a Web Inspector, DOM Inspector, JavaScript debugger, and a Console. iCab&#x27;s &quot;Automatic Update&quot; option, for any page it is rendering directly from the local hard disk, will automatically reload the page when changes are saved to disk. The HTML syntax validity checker displays a smiley face in the Status Bar and also, optionally, in the Toolbar. Clicking on the smiley will bring up a list of any errors on the page, as will &quot;Error Report&quot; from the Tools menu. Double clicking on an error will display the page source, with the offending syntax highlighted. The HTML syntax validator was first seen in the same author&#x27;s earlier web browser, CAB.

iCab&#x27;s Download manager allows the user to start, stop, resume and review downloads. It maintains a download history, and supports downloading of an individual page, or a whole site (crawling) with many user-selectable crawl-constraint options. It can save as portable web archives (a ZIP archive containing HTML, images and other files), or as individual files on the local hard drive.

iCab also contains the following features:

* Tabbed browsing.
* Javascript and CSS2 support.
* Multiple language support, including Arabic on older Macs (cannot display UTF-16 pages).
* Filtering:
** Filtering out of images and plugin content (e.g. ads).
** Adjust rendering, network, JavaScript, and cookies settings for individual sites or types of pages.
* Kiosk mode: full-screen display and access controls.
* Acid2 test compliance.
* Configurable print dialog.
* History window which can sort by title, last access date, or URL.
* Hotlist (bookmark) mechanism which can automatically or manually check for updates to bookmarked sites.
* Reload a single image on a page without needing to reload the whole page.
* Disable web &quot;annoyances&quot; such as animated GIFs and embedded sound files.
* User agent spoofing (i.e. pretending to be another browser).
* Support for sessions (i.e. saving and then loading all open windows and tabs).
* Add any query (e.g., search engine, Wikipedia) to the toolbar search widget by point-and-click.

== iCab Mobile ==
iCab Mobile is the mobile version of the iCab Web Browser for iOS and iPadOS. It is one of the oldest third-party web browsers for iOS, being released in 2009. The app is available on the app store for $1.99. iCab Mobile includes custom gestures, quick links for sharing, a drop down window that provides previews of tabs, a customizable user interface, Apple Watch integration, quick form filling, customizable filters for CSS pages, URLs, and cookies. It also has a file downloader and manager and integration with the Files app. Some reviewers have criticized it for its cluttered user interface.

<doc id="89405" wikidata="Q846235" url="?curid=89405" title="Frustum">
<text>In geometry, a ; (: frusta or frustums) is the portion of a solid (normally a pyramid or a cone) that lies between two parallel planes cutting the solid. In the case of a pyramid, the base faces are polygonal and the side faces are trapezoidal. A right frustum is a right pyramid or a right cone truncated perpendicularly to its axis; otherwise, it is an oblique frustum. 
In a &quot;truncated cone&quot; or &quot;truncated pyramid&quot;, the truncation plane is necessarily parallel to the cone&#x27;s base, as in a frustum.
If all its edges are forced to become of the same length, then a frustum becomes a &quot;prism&quot; (possibly oblique or/and with irregular bases).

==Elements, special cases, and related concepts==
A frustum&#x27;s axis is that of the original cone or pyramid. A frustum is circular if it has circular bases; it is right if the axis is perpendicular to both bases, and oblique otherwise.

The height of a frustum is the perpendicular distance between the planes of the two bases.

Cones and pyramids can be viewed as degenerate cases of frusta, where one of the cutting planes passes through the apex (so that the corresponding base reduces to a point). The pyramidal frusta are a subclass of prismatoids.

Two frusta with two congruent bases joined at these congruent bases make a bifrustum.

==Formulas==
===Volume===
The formula for the volume of a pyramidal square frustum was introduced by the ancient Egyptian mathematics in what is called the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, written in the 13th dynasty ():
:formula_1
where and are the base and top side lengths, and is the height.

The Egyptians knew the correct formula for the volume of such a truncated square pyramid, but no proof of this equation is given in the Moscow papyrus.

The volume of a conical or pyramidal frustum is the volume of the solid before slicing its &quot;apex&quot; off, minus the volume of this &quot;apex&quot;:
:formula_2
where and are the base and top areas, and and are the perpendicular heights from the apex to the base and top planes.

Considering that
:formula_3
the formula for the volume can be expressed as the third of the product of this proportionality, formula_4, and of the difference of the cubes of the heights and only:
:formula_5
By using the identity , one gets:
:formula_6
where is the height of the frustum.

Distributing formula_4 and substituting from its definition, the Heronian mean of areas and is obtained:
:formula_8
the alternative formula is therefore:
:formula_9
Heron of Alexandria is noted for deriving this formula, and with it, encountering the imaginary unit: the square root of negative one.

In particular:
*The volume of a circular cone frustum is:
::formula_10
:where and are the base and top radii.

*The volume of a pyramidal frustum whose bases are regular -gons is:
::formula_11
:where and are the base and top side lengths.

===Surface area===
For a right circular conical frustum the slant height formula_12 is

the lateral surface area is

and the total surface area is

where &quot;r&quot;1 and &quot;r&quot;2 are the base and top radii respectively.

==Examples==

*On the back (the reverse) of a United States one-dollar bill, a pyramidal frustum appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, surmounted by the Eye of Providence.
*Ziggurats, step pyramids, and certain ancient Native American mounds also form the frustum of one or more pyramids, with additional features such as stairs added.
*Chinese pyramids.
*The John Hancock Center in Chicago, Illinois is a frustum whose bases are rectangles.
*The Washington Monument is a narrow square-based pyramidal frustum topped by a small pyramid.
*The viewing frustum in 3D computer graphics is a virtual photographic or video camera&#x27;s usable field of view modeled as a pyramidal frustum.
*In the English translation of Stanislaw Lem&#x27;s short-story collection &quot;The Cyberiad&quot;, the poem &quot;Love and tensor algebra&quot; claims that &quot;every frustum longs to be a cone&quot;.
*Buckets and typical lampshades are everyday examples of conical frustums.
*Drinking glasses and some space capsules are also some examples.
*Garsų Gaudyklė: a wooden structure in Lithuania.
*Valençay cheese
*Rolo candies

<doc id="89425" wikidata="Q33481" url="?curid=89425" title="Arrow's impossibility theorem">
<text>Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem is a key result in social choice theory, showing that no ranking-based decision rule can satisfy the requirements of rational choice theory. Most notably, Arrow showed that no such rule can satisfy all of a certain set of seemingly simple and reasonable conditions that include independence of irrelevant alternatives, the principle that a choice between two alternatives and should not depend on the quality of some third, unrelated option .

The result is most often cited in discussions of voting rules. However, Arrow&#x27;s theorem is substantially broader, and can be applied to methods of social decision-making other than voting. It therefore generalizes Condorcet&#x27;s voting paradox, and shows similar problems exist for every collective decision-making procedure based on relative comparisons.

Plurality-rule methods like first-past-the-post and ranked-choice (instant-runoff) voting are highly sensitive to spoilers, particularly in situations where they are not forced. By contrast, majority-rule (Condorcet) methods of ranked voting uniquely minimize the number of spoiled elections by restricting them to rare situations called cyclic ties. Under some idealized models of voter behavior (e.g. Black&#x27;s left-right spectrum), spoiler effects can disappear entirely for these methods.

Arrow&#x27;s theorem does not cover rated voting rules, and thus cannot be used to inform their susceptibility to the spoiler effect. However, Gibbard&#x27;s theorem shows these methods&#x27; susceptibility to strategic voting, and generalizations of Arrow&#x27;s theorem describe cases where rated methods are susceptible to the spoiler effect.

== Background ==

When Kenneth Arrow proved his theorem in 1950, it inaugurated the modern field of social choice theory, a branch of welfare economics studying mechanisms to aggregate preferences and beliefs across a society. Such a mechanism of study can be a market, voting system, constitution, or even a moral or ethical framework.

=== Axioms of voting systems ===
==== Preferences ====
In the context of Arrow&#x27;s theorem, citizens are assumed to have ordinal preferences, i.e. orderings of candidates. If and are different candidates or alternatives, then formula_1 means is preferred to . Individual preferences (or ballots) are required to satisfy intuitive properties of orderings, e.g. they must be transitive—if formula_2 and formula_3, then formula_4. The social choice function is then a mathematical function that maps the individual orderings to a new ordering that represents the preferences of all of society.

==== Basic assumptions ====
Arrow&#x27;s theorem assumes as background that any non-degenerate social choice rule will satisfy:

* Unrestricted domain – the social choice function is a total function over the domain of all possible orderings of outcomes, not just a partial function.
** In other words, the system must always make &quot;some&quot; choice, and cannot simply &quot;give up&quot; when the voters have unusual opinions.
** Without this assumption, majority rule satisfies Arrow&#x27;s axioms by &quot;giving up&quot; whenever there is a Condorcet cycle.
* &quot;Non-dictatorship&quot; – the system does not depend on only one voter&#x27;s ballot.
** This weakens &quot;anonymity&quot; (one vote, one value) to allow rules that treat voters unequally.
** It essentially defines &quot;social&quot; choices as those depending on more than one person&#x27;s input.
* Non-imposition – the system does not ignore the voters entirely when choosing between some pairs of candidates.
** In other words, it is possible for any candidate to defeat any other candidate, given some combination of votes.
** This is often replaced with the stronger Pareto efficiency axiom: if every voter prefers over , then should defeat . However, the weaker non-imposition condition is sufficient.
Arrow&#x27;s original statement of the theorem included non-negative responsiveness as a condition, i.e., that &quot;increasing&quot; the rank of an outcome should not make them &quot;lose&quot;—in other words, that a voting rule shouldn&#x27;t penalize a candidate for being more popular. However, this assumption is not needed or used in his proof (except to derive the weaker condition of Pareto efficiency), and Arrow later corrected his statement of the theorem to remove the inclusion of this condition.

==== Independence ====
A commonly-considered axiom of rational choice is &quot;independence of irrelevant alternatives&quot; (IIA), which says that when deciding between and , one&#x27;s opinion about a third option should not affect their decision.
* Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) – the social preference between candidate and candidate should only depend on the individual preferences between and .
** In other words, the social preference should not change from formula_1 to formula_6 if voters change their preference about whether formula_7.
** This is equivalent to the claim about independence of spoiler candidates when using the standard construction of a placement function.
IIA is sometimes illustrated with a short joke by philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser:
: Morgenbesser, ordering dessert, is told by a waitress that he can choose between blueberry or apple pie. He orders apple. Soon the waitress comes back and explains cherry pie is also an option. Morgenbesser replies &quot;In that case, I&#x27;ll have blueberry.&quot;
Arrow&#x27;s theorem shows that if a society wishes to make decisions while always avoiding such self-contradictions, it cannot use ranked information alone.

== Theorem ==

=== Intuitive argument ===
Condorcet&#x27;s example is already enough to see the impossibility of a fair ranked voting system, given stronger conditions for fairness than Arrow&#x27;s theorem assumes. Suppose we have three candidates (formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10) and three voters whose preferences are as follows:

If formula_10 is chosen as the winner, it can be argued any fair voting system would say formula_9 should win instead, since two voters (1 and 2) prefer formula_9 to formula_10 and only one voter (3) prefers formula_10 to formula_9. However, by the same argument formula_8 is preferred to formula_9, and formula_10 is preferred to formula_8, by a margin of two to one on each occasion. Thus, even though each individual voter has consistent preferences, the preferences of society are contradictory: formula_8 is preferred over formula_9 which is preferred over formula_10 which is preferred over formula_8.

Because of this example, some authors credit Condorcet with having given an intuitive argument that presents the core of Arrow&#x27;s theorem. However, Arrow&#x27;s theorem is substantially more general; it applies to methods of making decisions other than one-man-one-vote elections, such as markets or weighted voting, based on ranked ballots.

=== Formal statement ===
Let formula_8 be a set of &quot;alternatives&quot;. A voter&#x27;s preferences over formula_8 are a complete and transitive binary relation on formula_8 (sometimes called a total preorder), that is, a subset formula_28 of formula_29 satisfying:
# (Transitivity) If formula_30 is in formula_28 and formula_32 is in formula_28, then formula_34 is in formula_28,
# (Completeness) At least one of formula_30 or formula_37 must be in formula_28.
The element formula_30 being in formula_28 is interpreted to mean that alternative formula_41 is preferred to alternative formula_42. This situation is often denoted formula_43 or formula_44. Denote the set of all preferences on formula_8 by formula_46. Let formula_47 be a positive integer. An &quot;ordinal (ranked)&quot; &quot;social welfare function&quot; is a function
: formula_48
which aggregates voters&#x27; preferences into a single preference on formula_8. An formula_47-tuple formula_51 of voters&#x27; preferences is called a &quot;preference profile&quot;.

Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem: If there are at least three alternatives, then there is no social welfare function satisfying all three of the conditions listed below:
; Pareto efficiency
: If alternative formula_41 is preferred to formula_42 for all orderings formula_54, then formula_41 is preferred to formula_42 by formula_57.
; Non-dictatorship
: There is no individual formula_58 whose preferences always prevail. That is, there is no formula_59 such that for all formula_51 and all formula_41 and formula_42, when formula_41 is preferred to formula_42 by formula_65 then formula_41 is preferred to formula_42 by formula_57.
; Independence of irrelevant alternatives
: For two preference profiles formula_69 and formula_70 such that for all individuals formula_58, alternatives formula_41 and formula_42 have the same order in formula_65 as in formula_75, alternatives formula_41 and formula_42 have the same order in formula_78 as in formula_79.

=== Formal proof ===
Arrow&#x27;s proof used the concept of &quot;decisive coalitions&quot;.

Definition:

* A subset of voters is a coalition.
* A coalition is decisive over an ordered pair formula_80 if, when everyone in the coalition ranks formula_81, society overall will always rank formula_82.
* A coalition is decisive if and only if it is decisive over all ordered pairs.

Our goal is to prove that the decisive coalition contains only one voter, who controls the outcome—in other words, a dictator.

The following proof is a simplification taken from Amartya Sen and Ariel Rubinstein. The simplified proof uses an additional concept:

* A coalition is weakly decisive over formula_80 if and only if when every voter formula_58 in the coalition ranks formula_81, &quot;and&quot; every voter formula_86 outside the coalition ranks formula_87, then formula_82.

Thenceforth assume that the social choice system satisfies unrestricted domain, Pareto efficiency, and IIA. Also assume that there are at least 3 distinct outcomes.

By Pareto, the entire set of voters is decisive. Thus by the group contraction lemma, there is a size-one decisive coalition—a dictator.

Proofs using the concept of the pivotal voter originated from Salvador Barberá in 1980. The proof given here is a simplified version based on two proofs published in &quot;Economic Theory&quot;.

==== Setup ====

Assume there are &quot;n&quot; voters. We assign all of these voters an arbitrary ID number, ranging from &quot;1&quot; through &quot;n&quot;, which we can use to keep track of each voter&#x27;s identity as we consider what happens when they change their votes. Without loss of generality, we can say there are three candidates who we call A, B, and C. (Because of IIA, including more than 3 candidates does not affect the proof.)

We will prove that any social choice rule respecting unanimity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is a dictatorship. The proof is in three parts:
# We identify a &quot;pivotal voter&quot; for each individual contest (A vs. B, B vs. C, and A vs. C). Their ballot swings the societal outcome.
# We prove this voter is a &quot;partial&quot; dictator. In other words, they get to decide whether A or B is ranked higher in the outcome.
# We prove this voter is the same person, hence this voter is a dictator.

==== Part one: There is a pivotal voter for A vs. B ====

Consider the situation where everyone prefers A to B, and everyone also prefers C to B. By unanimity, society must also prefer both A and C to B. Call this situation &quot;profile[0, x]&quot;.

On the other hand, if everyone preferred B to everything else, then society would have to prefer B to everything else by unanimity. Now arrange all the voters in some arbitrary but fixed order, and for each &quot;i&quot; let &quot;profile i&quot; be the same as &quot;profile 0&quot;, but move B to the top of the ballots for voters 1 through &quot;i&quot;. So &quot;profile 1&quot; has B at the top of the ballot for voter 1, but not for any of the others. &quot;Profile 2&quot; has B at the top for voters 1 and 2, but no others, and so on.

Since B eventually moves to the top of the societal preference as the profile number increases, there must be some profile, number &quot;k&quot;, for which B &quot;first&quot; moves &quot;above&quot; A in the societal rank. We call the voter &quot;k&quot; whose ballot change causes this to happen the &quot;pivotal voter for B over A&quot;. Note that the pivotal voter for B over A is not, a priori, the same as the pivotal voter for A over B. In part three of the proof we will show that these do turn out to be the same.

Also note that by IIA the same argument applies if &quot;profile 0&quot; is any profile in which A is ranked above B by every voter, and the pivotal voter for B over A will still be voter &quot;k&quot;. We will use this observation below.

==== Part two: The pivotal voter for B over A is a dictator for B over C ====
In this part of the argument we refer to voter &quot;k&quot;, the pivotal voter for B over A, as the &quot;pivotal voter&quot; for simplicity. We will show that the pivotal voter dictates society&#x27;s decision for B over C. That is, we show that no matter how the rest of society votes, if &quot;pivotal voter&quot; ranks B over C, then that is the societal outcome. Note again that the dictator for B over C is not a priori the same as that for C over B. In part three of the proof we will see that these turn out to be the same too.

In the following, we call voters 1 through &quot;k − 1&quot;, &quot;segment one&quot;, and voters &quot;k + 1&quot; through &quot;N&quot;, &quot;segment two&quot;. To begin, suppose that the ballots are as follows:

* Every voter in segment one ranks B above C and C above A.
* Pivotal voter ranks A above B and B above C.
* Every voter in segment two ranks A above B and B above C.

Then by the argument in part one (and the last observation in that part), the societal outcome must rank A above B. This is because, except for a repositioning of C, this profile is the same as &quot;profile k − 1&quot; from part one. Furthermore, by unanimity the societal outcome must rank B above C. Therefore, we know the outcome in this case completely.

Now suppose that pivotal voter moves B above A, but keeps C in the same position and imagine that any number (even all!) of the other voters change their ballots to move B below C, without changing the position of A. Then aside from a repositioning of C this is the same as &quot;profile k&quot; from part one and hence the societal outcome ranks B above A. Furthermore, by IIA the societal outcome must rank A above C, as in the previous case. In particular, the societal outcome ranks B above C, even though Pivotal Voter may have been the &quot;only&quot; voter to rank B above C. By IIA, this conclusion holds independently of how A is positioned on the ballots, so pivotal voter is a dictator for B over C.

==== Part three: There exists a dictator ====

In this part of the argument we refer back to the original ordering of voters, and compare the positions of the different pivotal voters (identified by applying parts one and two to the other pairs of candidates). First, the pivotal voter for B over C must appear earlier (or at the same position) in the line than the dictator for B over C: As we consider the argument of part one applied to B and C, successively moving B to the top of voters&#x27; ballots, the pivot point where society ranks B above C must come at or before we reach the dictator for B over C. Likewise, reversing the roles of B and C, the pivotal voter for C over B must be at or later in line than the dictator for B over C. In short, if &quot;k&quot;X/Y denotes the position of the pivotal voter for X over Y (for any two candidates X and Y), then we have shown

: &quot;k&quot;B/C ≤ kB/A ≤ &quot;k&quot;C/B.

Now repeating the entire argument above with B and C switched, we also have

: &quot;k&quot;C/B ≤ &quot;k&quot;B/C.

Therefore, we have

: &quot;k&quot;B/C = kB/A = &quot;k&quot;C/B

and the same argument for other pairs shows that all the pivotal voters (and hence all the dictators) occur at the same position in the list of voters. This voter is the dictator for the whole election.
=== Stronger versions ===

Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem still holds if Pareto efficiency is weakened to the following condition:

; Non-imposition
: For any two alternatives a and b, there exists some preference profile such that is preferred to by .

== Interpretation and practical solutions ==
Arrow&#x27;s theorem establishes that no ranked voting rule can &quot;always&quot; satisfy independence of irrelevant alternatives, but it says nothing about the frequency of spoilers. This led Arrow to remark that &quot;Most systems are not going to work badly all of the time. All I proved is that all can work badly at times.&quot;

Attempts at dealing with the effects of Arrow&#x27;s theorem take one of two approaches: either accepting his rule and searching for the least spoiler-prone methods, or dropping one or more of his assumptions, such as by focusing on rated voting rules.

=== Minimizing IIA failures: Majority-rule methods ===

The first set of methods studied by economists are the majority-rule, or &quot;Condorcet&quot;, methods. These rules limit spoilers to situations where majority rule is self-contradictory, called Condorcet cycles, and as a result uniquely minimize the possibility of a spoiler effect among ranked rules. (Indeed, many different social welfare functions can meet Arrow&#x27;s conditions under such restrictions of the domain. It has been proven, however, that under any such restriction, if there exists any social welfare function that adheres to Arrow&#x27;s criteria, then Condorcet method will adhere to Arrow&#x27;s criteria.) Condorcet believed voting rules should satisfy both independence of irrelevant alternatives and the majority rule principle, i.e. if most voters rank &quot;Alice&quot; ahead of &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot; should defeat &quot;Bob&quot; in the election.

Unfortunately, as Condorcet proved, this rule can be intransitive on some preference profiles. Thus, Condorcet proved a weaker form of Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem long before Arrow, under the stronger assumption that a voting system in the two-candidate case will agree with a simple majority vote.

Unlike pluralitarian rules such as ranked-choice runoff (RCV) or first-preference plurality, Condorcet methods avoid the spoiler effect in non-cyclic elections, where candidates can be chosen by majority rule. Political scientists have found such cycles to be fairly rare, suggesting they may be of limited practical concern. Spatial voting models also suggest such paradoxes are likely to be infrequent or even non-existent.

==== Left-right spectrum ====

Soon after Arrow published his theorem, Duncan Black showed his own remarkable result, the median voter theorem. The theorem proves that if voters and candidates are arranged on a left-right spectrum, Arrow&#x27;s conditions are all fully compatible, and all will be met by any rule satisfying Condorcet&#x27;s majority-rule principle.

More formally, Black&#x27;s theorem assumes preferences are &quot;single-peaked&quot;: a voter&#x27;s happiness with a candidate goes up and then down as the candidate moves along some spectrum. For example, in a group of friends choosing a volume setting for music, each friend would likely have their own ideal volume; as the volume gets progressively too loud or too quiet, they would be increasingly dissatisfied. If the domain is restricted to profiles where every individual has a single-peaked preference with respect to the linear ordering, then social preferences are acyclic. In this situation, Condorcet methods satisfy a wide variety of highly-desirable properties, including being fully spoilerproof.

The rule does not fully generalize from the political spectrum to the political compass, a result related to the McKelvey-Schofield chaos theorem. However, a well-defined Condorcet winner does exist if the distribution of voters is rotationally symmetric or otherwise has a uniquely-defined median. In most realistic situations, where voters&#x27; opinions follow a roughly-normal distribution or can be accurately summarized by one or two dimensions, Condorcet cycles are rare (though not unheard of).

==== Generalized stability theorems ====
The Campbell-Kelly theorem shows that Condorcet methods are the most spoiler-resistant class of ranked voting systems: whenever it is possible for some ranked voting system to avoid a spoiler effect, a Condorcet method will do so. In other words, replacing a ranked method with its Condorcet variant (i.e. elect a Condorcet winner if they exist, and otherwise run the method) will sometimes prevent a spoiler effect, but can never create a new one.

In 1977, Ehud Kalai and Eitan Muller gave a full characterization of domain restrictions admitting a nondictatorial and strategyproof social welfare function. These correspond to preferences for which there is a Condorcet winner.

Holliday and Pacuit devised a voting system that provably minimizes the number of candidates who are capable of spoiling an election, albeit at the cost of occasionally failing vote positivity (though at a much lower rate than seen in instant-runoff voting).

=== Going beyond Arrow&#x27;s theorem: Rated voting ===

As shown above, the proof of Arrow&#x27;s theorem relies crucially on the assumption of ranked voting, and is not applicable to rated voting systems. This opens up the possibility of passing all of the criteria given by Arrow. These systems ask voters to rate candidates on a numerical scale (e.g. from 0–10), and then elect the candidate with the highest average (for score voting) or median (graduated majority judgment).

Because Arrow&#x27;s theorem no longer applies, other results are required to determine whether rated methods are immune to the spoiler effect, and under what circumstances. Intuitively, cardinal information can only lead to such immunity if it&#x27;s meaningful; simply providing cardinal data is not enough.

Some rated systems, such as range voting and majority judgment, pass independence of irrelevant alternatives when the voters rate the candidates on an absolute scale. However, when they use relative scales, more general impossibility theorems show that the methods (within that context) still fail IIA. As Arrow later suggested, relative ratings may provide more information than pure rankings, but this information does not suffice to render the methods immune to spoilers.

While Arrow&#x27;s theorem does not apply to graded systems, Gibbard&#x27;s theorem still does: no voting game can be straightforward (i.e. have a single, clear, always-best strategy).

==== Meaningfulness of cardinal information ====

Arrow&#x27;s framework assumed individual and social preferences are orderings or rankings, i.e. statements about which outcomes are better or worse than others. Taking inspiration from the strict behaviorism popular in psychology, some philosophers and economists rejected the idea of comparing internal human experiences of well-being. Such philosophers claimed it was impossible to compare the strength of preferences across people who disagreed; Sen gives as an example that it would be impossible to know whether the Great Fire of Rome was good or bad, because despite killing thousands of Romans, it had the positive effect of letting Nero expand his palace.

Arrow originally agreed with these positions and rejected cardinal utility, leading him to focus his theorem on preference rankings. However, he later stated that cardinal methods can provide additional useful information, and that his theorem is not applicable to them.

John Harsanyi noted Arrow&#x27;s theorem could be considered a weaker version of his own theorem and other utility representation theorems like the VNM theorem, which generally show that rational behavior requires consistent cardinal utilities.

==== Nonstandard spoilers ====
Behavioral economists have shown individual irrationality involves violations of IIA (e.g. with decoy effects), suggesting human behavior can cause IIA failures even if the voting method itself does not. However, past research has typically found such effects to be fairly small, and such psychological spoilers can appear regardless of electoral system. Balinski and Laraki discuss techniques of ballot design derived from psychometrics that minimize these psychological effects, such as asking voters to give each candidate a verbal grade (e.g. &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;excellent&quot;) and issuing instructions to voters that refer to their ballots as judgments of individual candidates. Similar techniques are often discussed in the context of contingent valuation.

=== Esoteric solutions ===
In addition to the above practical resolutions, there exist unusual (less-than-practical) situations where Arrow&#x27;s requirement of IIA can be satisfied.

==== Supermajority rules ====
Supermajority rules can avoid Arrow&#x27;s theorem at the cost of being poorly-decisive (i.e. frequently failing to return a result). In this case, a threshold that requires a formula_89 majority for ordering 3 outcomes, formula_90 for 4, etc. does not produce voting paradoxes.

In spatial (n-dimensional ideology) models of voting, this can be relaxed to require only formula_91 (roughly 64%) of the vote to prevent cycles, so long as the distribution of voters is well-behaved (quasiconcave). These results provide some justification for the common requirement of a two-thirds majority for constitutional amendments, which is sufficient to prevent cyclic preferences in most situations.

==== Infinite populations ====
Fishburn shows all of Arrow&#x27;s conditions can be satisfied for uncountably infinite sets of voters given the axiom of choice; however, Kirman and Sondermann demonstrated this requires disenfranchising almost all members of a society (eligible voters form a set of measure 0), leading them to refer to such societies as &quot;invisible dictatorships&quot;.

== Common misconceptions ==
Arrow&#x27;s theorem is not related to strategic voting, which does not appear in his framework, though the theorem does have important implications for strategic voting (being used as a lemma to prove Gibbard&#x27;s theorem). The Arrovian framework of social welfare assumes all voter preferences are known and the only issue is in aggregating them.

Monotonicity (called positive association by Arrow) is not a condition of Arrow&#x27;s theorem. This misconception is caused by a mistake by Arrow himself, who included the axiom in his original statement of the theorem but did not use it. Dropping the assumption does not allow for constructing a social welfare function that meets his other conditions.

Contrary to a common misconception, Arrow&#x27;s theorem deals with the limited class of ranked-choice voting systems, rather than voting systems as a whole.

<doc id="89440" wikidata="Q437423" url="?curid=89440" title="Philippe de Commines">
<text>Philippe de Commines (or de Commynes or &quot;Philippe de Comines&quot;; Latin: &quot;Philippus Cominaeus&quot;; 1447 – 18 October 1511) was a writer and diplomat in the courts of Burgundy and France. He has been called &quot;the first truly modern writer&quot; (Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve) and &quot;the first critical and philosophical historian since classical times&quot; (&quot;Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot;). Neither a chronicler nor a historian in the usual sense of the word, his analyses of the contemporary political scene are what made him virtually unique in his own time.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Commines was born at Renescure (in what was then the county of Flanders), to an outwardly wealthy family. His parents were Colard van den Clyte (or &quot;de La Clyte&quot;) and Marguerite d&#x27;Armuyden. In addition to being &quot;seigneur&quot; of Renescure, Watten and Saint-Venant, Clyte became bailiff of Flanders for the Duke of Burgundy in 1436, and had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Philippe took his surname from a &quot;seigneurie&quot; on the river Lys which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother, Jeanne de Waziers. His paternal grandfather, also named Colard van den Clyte (d. 1404), had been governor first of Cassel and then of Lille. However, the death of Commines&#x27; father in 1453 left him the orphaned owner of an estate saddled with enormous debts. In his teens he was taken into the care of Philip the Good (1419–1467), Duke of Burgundy, who was his godfather. He fought at the Battle of Montlhéry in 1465 and the Battle of Brusthem in 1467 but in general seems to have kept a low profile.

===Burgundy===
In 1468, he became a knight in the household of Charles the Bold, Philip&#x27;s son who succeeded to the dukedom in 1467, and thereafter he moved in the most exalted circles, being party to many important decisions and present at history-making events. A key event in Commines&#x27;s life seems to have been the meeting between Charles and Louis XI of France at Péronne in October 1468. Although Commines&#x27;s own account skates over the details, it is apparent from other contemporary sources that Louis believed Commines had saved his life. This may explain Louis&#x27;s later enthusiasm in wooing him away from the Burgundians.

In 1470 Commines was sent on an embassy to Calais, then an English possession. It is unlikely that he ever visited England itself, what he knew of its politics and personalities coming mostly from meetings with exiles, both Yorkist and Lancastrian; these included Henry Tudor and Warwick the Kingmaker. He also met King Edward IV of England during the latter&#x27;s continental exile and later wrote a description of his appearance and character. Like other Burgundians, Georges Chastellain, Olivier de la Marche, he mentions that King Edward was most beautiful, that he was very popular with his people and his subjects, but that he does not doubt at all (before the exile, Edward never heard any of Duke Charles&#x27; and his people&#x27;s warnings). Commines praises Edward&#x27;s best friend William Hastings as &quot;le plus grand chevalier&quot;, &quot;un sage chevalier&quot;, while overly attacks Richard III as murderer of princes and &quot;cruel&quot;. (In addition, according to Commines and rumours in Burgundy, Richard killed King Henry VI.) But unlike Olivier de la Marche, Commines mentions that Edward was a bastard and his real father was Blayborne (in French, Blayborgne), and that Henry Tudor was not eligible to claim the throne.
Commines was a great favorite with Duke Charles for seven years (going back to when he had still been Count of Charolais). The 19th-century scholar Isaac D&#x27;Israeli, recounts that one day, when they came home from hunting and were joking around as was their wont within the &quot;family&quot;, Commines &quot;ordered&quot; the prince to remove Commines&#x27;s boots as if he were a servant; laughing, the prince did so but then tossed the boot at Commines, and it bloodied his nose. Everyone in the Burgundian court started calling Commines &quot;booted head&quot;. D&#x27;Israeli, in his 1824 &quot;Curiosities of Literature&quot;, suggests that Commines&#x27;s hatred for the duke of Burgundy poisoned everything he wrote about him, but comments:
&quot;When we are versed in the history of the times, we often discover that memoir-writers have some secret poison in their hearts. Many, like Comines, have had the boot dashed on their nose. Personal rancour wonderfully enlivens the style... Memoirs are often dictated by its fiercest spirit; and then histories are composed from memoirs. Where is TRUTH? Not always in histories and memoirs!&quot;

===Service of Louis XI===

D&#x27;Israeli says Commines so resented his nickname that it was the reason he suddenly left Burgundy and went into the service of the French king, but the financial incentives offered by Louis provide a more than adequate explanation: Commines was still heavily burdened with his father&#x27;s debts. He fled by night from Normandy on 7 August 1472, and joined Louis near Angers. On the following morning, when Duke Charles discovered his servant and god-brother missing, he confiscated all of Commines&#x27; property. These were later given to Philip I of Croÿ-Chimay.

Louis was generous in making up for those losses. On 27 January 1473 the king wed him to a Poitevin heiress, Hélène de Chambes (d.1532), &quot;dame&quot; of the &quot;seigneuries&quot; of Argenton, Varennes, and Maison-Rouge. When Hélène&#x27;s sister, Colette de Chambes, was believed to have been poisoned by her aged husband Louis d&#x27;Amboise, Viscount of Thouars, in a fit of jealousy over her affair with Charles de Valois, Louis XI&#x27;s brother, the king had confiscated most of his properties. Some of these he later gave to Commines for life, including the Princedom of Talmond in Poitou, and the &quot;seigneuries&quot; of Berrie, Sables, and Olonne. Despite later reverses in the family&#x27;s fortunes, on 13 August 1504 their only child, Jeanne de Commines (d.1513), made a splendid marriage to the heir of Brittany&#x27;s most powerful family, René de Brosse comte de Penthièvre (d.1524).

As a long-time enemy of Burgundy, Louis no doubt valued the inside information Commines was able to provide, and Commines quickly became one of the king&#x27;s most trusted advisers. Jean Dufournet&#x27;s 1966 study of Commines has shown that the next five years, up to 1477, were the most prosperous from Commines&#x27;s point of view, and the only ones when he truly had Louis&#x27;s confidence. After Charles the Bold&#x27;s death in 1477, the two men openly disagreed about how best to take political advantage of the situation. Commines himself admitted associating with some of the king&#x27;s most prominent opponents and referred to another incident, in May 1478, when Louis reprimanded him for allegedly being open to bribery. Thereafter, much of his diplomatic work was done in the Italian arena, and he came into contact with Lorenzo de Medici on several occasions.

When Louis began to suffer ill-health, Commines was apparently welcomed back into the fold and performed personal services for the king. Many of his activities during the period seem to have involved a degree of secrecy; he was effectively acting as a kind of undercover agent. However, he never regained the level of intimacy with the king that he had previously enjoyed, and Louis&#x27;s death in 1483, when Commines was still only in his thirties, left him without many friends at court. Nevertheless, he retained a place on the royal council until 1485. Then, having been implicated in the Orleanist rebellion, he was taken prisoner and kept in confinement for over two years, from January 1487 until March 1489. For some of that period, he was kept in an iron cage.

===Mémoires===
After his release, Commines was exiled to his estate at Dreux, where he began to write his &quot;Mémoires&quot;. (This title was not used until an edition of 1552.) By 1490, however, he was recovering his position at court and was in the service of King Charles VIII of France. Charles never allowed him the privileged position he had held under Louis, and he was once again used as an envoy to the Italian states. However, his personal affairs were still problematic, and his right to some of the possessions given him by Louis was subject to legal challenges.

In 1498 (fifteen years after the death of Louis XI of France), Commines&#x27;s work was completed (first published in 1524 in Paris), and is considered a historical record of immense importance, largely because of its author&#x27;s cynical and forthright attitude to the events and machinations he had witnessed. His writings reveal many of the less savoury aspects of the reign of Louis XI, and Commines related them without apology, insisting that the late king&#x27;s virtues outweighed his vices. He is regarded as a major primary source for 15th-century European history.

The &quot;Mémoires&quot; are divided into &quot;books&quot;, the first six of which were written between 1488 and 1494, and relate the course of events from the beginning of Commines&#x27; career (1464) up to the death of King Louis. The remaining two books were written between 1497 and 1501 (printed in 1528), and deal with the Italian wars, ending in the death of King Charles VIII of France.
Commines&#x27; scepticism is summed up in his own words: &quot;Car ceux qui gagnent en ont toujours l&#x27;honneur&quot; (&quot;For the honours always go to the winners&quot;). Some have disputed whether his candid phrases disguise a deeper dishonesty. Yet at no time does he attempt to present himself as a hero, even when recounting his military career. His attitude to politics is one of pragmatism, and his ideas are practical and progressive. His reflections on the events he has witnessed are profound by comparison with those of Froissart, who lived a century earlier. His psychological insights into the behaviour of kings are ahead of their time, reminiscent in some ways of the contemporaneous writings of Niccolò Machiavelli. Like Machiavelli, Commines aims to instruct the reader in statecraft, though from a slightly different viewpoint. In particular, he notes how Louis repeatedly got the better of the English, not by military might, but by political machination.

<doc id="89442" wikidata="Q105278" url="?curid=89442" title="House of Lancaster">
<text>The House of Lancaster was a cadet branch of the royal House of Plantagenet. The first house was created when King Henry III of England created the Earldom of Lancasterfrom which the house was namedfor his second son Edmund Crouchback in 1267. Edmund had already been created Earl of Leicester in 1265 and was granted the lands and privileges of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, after de Montfort&#x27;s death and attainder at the end of the Second Barons&#x27; War. When Edmund&#x27;s son Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, inherited his father-in-law&#x27;s estates and title of Earl of Lincoln he became at a stroke the most powerful nobleman in England, with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local levels. This brought himand Henry, his younger brotherinto conflict with their cousin King Edward II, leading to Thomas&#x27;s execution. Henry inherited Thomas&#x27;s titles and he and his son, who was also called Henry, gave loyal service to Edward&#x27;s son King Edward III.

The second house of Lancaster was descended from John of Gaunt, who married the heiress of the first house, Blanche of Lancaster. Edward III married all his sons to wealthy English heiresses rather than following his predecessors&#x27; practice of finding continental political marriages for royal princes. Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, had no male heir so Edward married his son John to Henry&#x27;s heiress daughter and John&#x27;s third cousin Blanche of Lancaster. This gave John the vast wealth of the House of Lancaster. Their son Henry usurped the throne in 1399, creating one of the factions in the Wars of the Roses. There was an intermittent dynastic struggle between the descendants of Edward III. In these wars, the term Lancastrian became a reference to members of the family and their supporters. The family provided England with three kings: Henry IV (r. 1399–1413), Henry V (r. 1413–1422), and Henry VI (r. 1422–1461 and 1470–1471).

The house became extinct in the male line upon the death or murder in the Tower of London of Henry VI, following the battlefield execution of his son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, by supporters of the House of York in 1471. Lancastrian cognatic descentfrom John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster&#x27;s daughter Philippacontinued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal while the Lancastrian political cause was maintained by Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Lancastrian Beaufortseventually leading to the establishment of the House of Tudor. The Lancastrians left a legacy through the patronage of the arts, most notably in founding Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. However, to historians&#x27; chagrin, it is Shakespeare&#x27;s partly fictionalized history plays rather than medievalist scholarly research that has the greater influence on modern perceptions of the dynasty.

==Origin of the Earls of Lancaster==

After the supporters of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons&#x27; War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons&#x27; leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.

 Edmund&#x27;s second marriage to Blanche of Artois, the widow of the King of Navarre, placed him at the centre of the European aristocracy. Blanche&#x27;s daughter Joan I of Navarre was queen regnant of Navarre and through her marriage to Philip IV of France was queen consort of France. Edmund&#x27;s son Thomas became the most powerful nobleman in England, gaining the Earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury through marriage to the heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. His income was £11,000 per annumdouble that of the next wealthiest earl.

Thomas and his younger brother Henry served in the coronation of their cousin King Edward II of England on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the Sword of Mercy, and Henry carried the royal sceptre. After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the Lords Ordainers, who demanded the banishment of Piers Gaveston and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. Edward&#x27;s authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn. This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward&#x27;s power by republishing the Ordinances of 1311. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to Pontefract Castle. This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the Treaty of Leake. In 1321 Edward&#x27;s rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but because he was Edward&#x27;s cousin he was given a quicker death by beheading.

Henry joined the revolt of Edward&#x27;s wife Isabella of France and Mortimer in 1326, pursuing and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward&#x27;s deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas&#x27;s conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained possession of the Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas&#x27;s treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland&#x27;s independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and checked the revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry&#x27;s further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for the last fifteen years of his life.

==Duchy and Palatinate of Lancaster==
Henry&#x27;s son, also named Henry, was born at the castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry&#x27;s memoirs, he was better at martial arts than academic subjects and did not learn to read until later in life. Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward&#x27;s Scottish campaign. After the outbreak of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward&#x27;s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.

In 1345, Edward III launched a major, three-pronged attack on France. The Earl of Northampton attacked from Brittany, Edward from Flanders, and Henry from Aquitaine in the south. Moving rapidly through the country, Henry confronted the Comte d&#x27;Isle at the Battle of Auberoche and achieved a victory described as &quot;the greatest single achievement of Lancaster&#x27;s entire military career&quot;. The ransom from the prisoners has been estimated at £50,000. Edward rewarded Henry by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter. An even greater honour was bestowed on Lancaster when Edward created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was relatively new in England, with only Cornwall being a previous ducal title. Lancaster was also given palatinate status for the county of Lancashire, which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown. There were two other counties palatine; Durham was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate and Chester was crown property.

In 1350, Henry was present at the naval victory at Winchelsea, where he saved the life of the Black Prince. He spent 1351–2 on crusade in Prussia where a quarrel with Otto, Duke of Brunswick, almost led to a duel between the two men, which was only averted by the intervention of John II of France. As campaigning in France resumed, Henry participated in the last great offensive of the Rheims campaign of 1359–60the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; Warbefore returning to England where he fell ill and died, most likely of the plague, at Leicester Castle.

Edward III of England married John of Gaunt, his third surviving son, to Henry&#x27;s heiress Blanche of Lancaster. On Henry&#x27;s death, Edward conferred on Gaunt the second creation of the title of Duke of Lancaster, which made Gaunt, after Edward, the wealthiest landowner in England. Gaunt enjoyed great political influence during his lifetime, but upon his death in 1399 his lands were confiscated by Richard II. Gaunt&#x27;s exiled son and heir Henry of Bolingbroke returned home and gathered military support in clear contravention of Richard&#x27;s treason act of 1397, which included a definition of treason of &quot;or [to] ... raiseth People and rideth against the King to make War within his Realm ...&quot;. Although he claimed his aim was restoration of his Lancaster inheritance, this Act and Henry&#x27;s knowledge of Richard&#x27;s charactersuspicious and vindictiveprobably meant Henry knew that only by removing Richard from power could he be secure. Henry unified popular opposition to Richard II, took control of the kingdom and Richardrecognising that he had insufficient support to resistsurrendered to Henry&#x27;s forces at Conwy Castle. Henry instigated a commission to decide who should be king. Richard was forced to abdicate and although Henry was not next in line, he was chosen by an unlawfully constituted parliament dominated by his supporters. After the first unrest of his reign and a revolt by the Earls of Salisbury, Gloucester, Exeter and Surrey, Richard reputedly starved to death. There is some debate as to whether this was self-inflicted or ordered by Henry to end the risk of restoration without leaving incriminating marks on the body.

==Reign of Henry IV==

There is much debate among historians about Henry&#x27;s accession, in part because some see it as a cause of the Wars of the Roses. For many historians, the accession by force of the throne broke principles the Plantagenets had established successfully over two and a half centuries and allowed any magnate with sufficient power and Plantagenet blood to have ambitions to assume the throne. Richard had attempted to disinherit Henry and remove him from the succession. In response, Henry&#x27;s legal advisors, led by William Thirning, dissuaded Henry from claiming the throne by right of conquest and instead look for legal justification. Although Henry established a committee to investigate his assertion that his mother had legitimate rights through descent from Edmund Crouchback, who he said was the elder son of Henry III of England but was set aside because of deformity, no evidence was found. The eight-year-old Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir general to Richard II by being the great-grandson of Edward III&#x27;s second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and also the son of Richard&#x27;s last nominated heir. In desperation, Henry&#x27;s advisors made the case that Henry was heir male to Henry III and this was supported by thirteenth-century entails. Mortimer&#x27;s sister Anne de Mortimer married Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, son of Edward III&#x27;s fourth son Edmund of Langley, consolidating Anne&#x27;s place in the succession with that of the more junior House of York. As a child, Mortimer was not considered a serious contender and, as an adult, he showed no interest in the throne. He instead loyally served the House of Lancaster. Mortimer informed Henry V when Conisburgh, in what was later called the Southampton Plot, attempted to place him on the throne instead of Henry&#x27;s newly crowned sontheir mutual cousinleading to the execution of Conisburgh and the other plotters.

Henry IV was plagued with financial problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions and declining healthincluding leprosy and epilepsy. The Percy family had been some of Henry&#x27;s leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely at their own expense, but revolted in the face of lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. Henry Percy (Hotspur) was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Hotspur&#x27;s father Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, supported Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York, in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated. Henry had Scrope executed in an act comparable to the murder of another ArchbishopThomas Becketby men loyal to Henry II. This would probably have led to Henry&#x27;s excommunication, but the church was in the midst of the Western Schism, with competing popes keen on Henry&#x27;s support; it protested but took no action. In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of Harlech Castle in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.

Henry IV was succeeded by his son Henry V, and eventually by his grandson Henry VI in 1422.

==Henry V and the Hundred Years&#x27; War==


Henry V of England was a successful and ruthless monarch. He was quick to re-assert the claim to the French throne he inherited from Edward III, continuing what was later called the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The war was not a formal, continuous conflict but a series of English raids and military expeditions from 1337 until 1453. There were six major royal expeditions; Henry himself led the fifth and sixth, but these were unlike the smaller, frequent, provincial campaigns. In Henry&#x27;s first major campaignand the fifth major royal campaign of the warhe invaded France, captured Harfleur, made a chevauchée to Calais and won a near-total victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt despite being outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and low on supplies. In his second campaign, he recaptured much of Normandy and in a treaty secured a marriage to Catherine of Valois. The terms of the Treaty of Troyes were that Henry&#x27;s and Catherine&#x27;s heirs would succeed to the throne of France. This condition was contested by the Dauphin and the momentum of the war changed. In 1421, Henry&#x27;s brother Thomas, Duke of Clarence, was killed at the Battle of Baugé, and Henry V died of dysentery at Vincennes in 1422.

Henry VI of England was less than a year old but his unclesled by Henry V&#x27;s brother John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedfordcontinued the war. There were more victories, including the Battle of Verneuil, but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level given the relative economic and manpower resources of England against France. Joan of Arc&#x27;s involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burnt at the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.

==Henry VI and the fall of the House of Lancaster==


The Hundred Years&#x27; War caused political division between the Lancastrians and the other Plantagenets during the minority of Henry VI: Bedford wanted to maintain the majority of the Lancastrians&#x27; French possessions; Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester wanted to hold only Calais; and Cardinal Beaufort desired a negotiated peace. Gloucester&#x27;s attacks on Beaufort forced the latter from public life but brought him little advantage as the Earl of Suffolk&#x27;s influence over the king enabled him to direct policy for the rest of the decade. Gloucester remained heir presumptive but in 1441 his ambitious wife, Eleanor Cobham, consulted astrologers on the likelihood of the king&#x27;s death and was arrested for treasonable necromancyalthough Gloucester was not implicated he was discredited forced into retirement. In 1447 Suffolk had him arrested and within days he died in prison.

England&#x27;s ally Philip III, Duke of Burgundy defected to Charles when the English ambassadors&#x27; refusal to renounce the claim to the French crown stalled negotiations, signing the Treaty of Arras (1435). The French reorganised the superior numbers of their feudal levies into a modern professional army and retook Paris, Rouen, Bordeaux and Normandy. Victories at the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and the Battle of Castillon in 1453 brought the war to an end with the House of Lancaster losing forever all its French holdings, except Calais and the Channel Islands.

Henry VI proved to be a weak king and vulnerable to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry&#x27;s cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.

Henry&#x27;s marriage to Margaret of Anjou prompted criticism from Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, because it included the surrender of Maine and an extended truce with France. York was Henry&#x27;s cousin through his descent from Edward III sons Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Edmund, Duke of York. This gave York political influence but he was removed from English and French politics through his appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. On returning to England, York was conscious of the fate of Henry&#x27;s uncle Humphrey at the hands of the Beauforts and suspicious that Henry intended to nominate Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, as heir presumptive, and recruited military forces. Armed conflict was avoided because York lacked aristocratic support and was forced to swear allegiance to Henry. However, when Henry later underwent a mental breakdown, York was named regent. Henry was trusting and not a man of war, but Margaret was more assertive and showed open enmity towards Yorkparticularly after the birth of a male heir that resolved the succession question and assured her position.

According to historian Robin Storey, &quot;If Henry&#x27;s insanity was a tragedy; his recovery was a national disaster&quot;. When Henry&#x27;s sanity returned, the court party reasserted its authority but York and his relatives, the Nevilles, defeated them at the First Battle of St Albans. Historian Anthony Goodman suggests that around 50 men were killed; among them were Somerset and two Percy lords, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford, creating feuds that would confound reconciliation attempts despite the shock to the ruling class caused by the armed conflict. Threatened with treason charges and lacking support, York, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. Henry was captured by the opposition when the Nevilles returned and won the Battle of Northampton. York joined them, surprising parliament by claiming the throne and then forcing through the Act of Accord stating that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime and that York would succeed him. The disinheriting of Henry&#x27;s son Edward was unacceptable to Margaret so the conflict continued. York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his head was displayed at Micklegate Bar, York, along with those of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisburyboth of whom were captured and beheaded.

Margaret gained the support of the Scottish queen Mary of Guelders, and with a Scottish army she pillaged into southern England. The citizens of London feared the city being plundered and enthusiastically welcomed York&#x27;s son Edward, Earl of March. Margaret&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Towton confirmed Edward&#x27;s position and he was crowned. Disaffected with Edward&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and preferment of her formerly Lancastrian-supporting family, Warwick and Clarence defected to the Lancastrians. The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Henry&#x27;s son Edward to Anne, Warwick&#x27;s daughter. Edward and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled England. When they returned, Clarence switched sides at the Battle of Barnet and Warwick and his brother were killed. Henry, Margaret and Edward of Lancaster were caught at the Battle of Tewkesbury before they could escape back to France. Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, was executed on the battlefield and John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset, was killed in the fightingmeaning that when his brother Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset, was executed two days later, the Beaufort family became extinct in the legitimate male line. The captive Henry was murdered on 21 May 1471 in the Tower of London and buried in Chertsey Abbey, extinguishing the House of Lancaster.

==Legacy==

===Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays===

Historians have been dismayed by Shakespeare&#x27;s influence on the perception of the later medieval period exceeding that of academic research. While the chronology of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays runs from King John to Henry VIII, they are dominated by eight plays in which members of the House of Lancaster play a significant part, voicing speeches on a par with those in Hamlet and King Lear. These plays are:
* &quot;Richard II&quot;
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;
* &quot;Henry V&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;
* &quot;Richard III&quot;.

According to the historian Norman Davies, the plays were constrained by the political and religious requirements of Tudor England. While they are factually inaccurate, they demonstrate how the past and the House of Lancaster are remembered in terms of myth, legend, ideas and popular misconceptions. Shakespeare avoided contentious political and religious issues to dubiously illustrate Tudor England as having rejected medieval conflict and entered an era of harmony and prosperity. The famous patriotic &quot;sceptr&#x27;d isle&quot; speech is voiced by John of Gaunt, a man who spent the majority of his life in Aquitaine, and is a piece of poetic licence that illustrates English prejudices. &quot;Henry V&quot; is one-sided with little sympathy for the French. Many of these historical lines illustrate historical myth rather than realism.

===Succession===

Lancastrian cognatic descent from John of Gaunt and Blanche&#x27;s daughter Phillipa continued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal. The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament during the reign of Richard II. Henry IV had tried to debar them from the succession by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster&#x27;s claims to the throne but this was of limited effect. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what some might claim a better right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.

With the House of Lancaster extinct, Henry claimed to be the Lancastrian heir through his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort. His father, Edmund Tudor, was Henry VI&#x27;s maternal half-brother. In 1485, Henry Tudor united increasing opposition within England to the reign of Richard III with the Lancastrian cause to take the throne. To further legitimise his claim, Henry married Elizabeth of YorkEdward IV&#x27;s daughterand promoted the House of Tudor as a dynasty of dual Lancastrian and Yorkist descent.

===Religion, education and the arts===
The Lancastrians were both pious and well read. Henry IV was the first English king known to have possessed a vernacular Bible, supported the canonization of John Twenge, gave a pension to the anchoress Margaret Pensax and maintained close relations with several Westminster recluses. His household accounts as king record conventional payments to large numbers of paupers (12,000 on Easter day 1406) and the intercession for him of twenty-four oratores domini regis at 2d each per day. However, his reliance on the church was both personal and political. Archbishop Arundel gave the Lancastrians vital support and carried other bishops with him. In return the church required support for religious orthodoxy against heresy. Lollards were suppressed and heresy was made a capital offence in England under the statute of De haeretico comburendo even though Henry could not afford to overly antagonize his supporters with Lollard sympathies, including those among his Lancastrian retainers.

According to the author of the Gesta Henrici quinti, Henry V aimed &quot;to promote the honour of God, the extension of the Church, the deliverance of his country and the peace and tranquillity of kingdoms&quot;. He was deeply religious, engaged with ecclesiastical issues and saw that his role as king was to honour God, extend the church, fight heresy and defend the established social order. All his victories, especially Agincourt, were attributed to divine intervention. Henry V founded Syon Abbey in 1415, as penance for his father&#x27;s execution of Archbishop Scrope, and three monasteries in London: for Carthusian, Bridgettine and Celestine orders. The equally devout Henry VI continued the architectural patronage begun by his father, founding Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and leaving a lasting educational and architectural legacy in buildings including King&#x27;s College Chapel and Eton College Chapel.

The Lancastrian regime was founded and legitimised by formal lying that was both public and official. This has been described as &quot;a series of unconstitutional actions&quot; based &quot;upon three major acts of perjury&quot;. The historian K.B. McFarlane found it hard &quot;to think of another moment of comparable importance in medieval English political history when the supply of information was so effectively manipulated as it was by Henry IV on this occasion&quot;. The Lancastrians patronised poets for panegyric purposes for years before Henry IV ascended the throne, including Geoffrey Chaucer who dedicated The Book of the Duchess to Blanche of Lancaster around 1368. In 1400, poets in the pay of Henry IV were directed to propaganda purposes. John Gower based his Cronica Tripertita on the official Lancastrian accounts of the usurpation:&quot;The Record and Process of the Deposition of Richard II&quot; from 1399. Gower also produced a number of further favourable works including &quot;In praise of peace&quot; which was dedicated to Henry IV.

==Family tree==








== Coats of Arms ==



===Lancaster badges===
The Red Rose of Lancaster derives from the gold rose badge of Edward I of England. Other members of his family used variants of the royal badge, with the king&#x27;s brother, the Earl of Lancaster, using a red rose. It is believed that the Red Rose of Lancaster was the House of Lancaster&#x27;s badge during the Wars of the Roses. Evidence for this &quot;wearing of the rose&quot; includes land tenure records requiring service of a red rose yearly for a manor held directly from Henry VI of England. There are, however, doubts as to whether the red rose was actually an emblem taken up by the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses. Adrian Ailes has noted that the red rose &quot;probably owes its popular usage to Henry VII quickly responding to the pre-existing Yorkist white rose in an age when signs and symbols could speak louder than words.&quot;

It also allowed Henry to invent and exploit his most famous heraldic device, the Tudor Rose, combining the so-called Lancastrian red rose and the White Rose of York. This floral union neatly symbolised the restoration of peace and harmony and his marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York. It was a brilliant piece of simple heraldic propaganda.&quot; The Tudor Rose is used as the plant badge of England (Scotland uses the thistle, Ireland uses the shamrock, and Wales uses the leek).

<text>Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band formed in Buffalo, New York, in 1988, now based in Tampa, Florida.

The band has released sixteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums, and two live albums. The band has had little radio or television exposure throughout its existence, although a cult following began to build with the releases of their early albums, including &quot;Butchered at Birth&quot; (1991) and &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot; (1992). As of 2015, they achieved worldwide sales of two million units for combined sales of all their albums. In April 2021, Cannibal Corpse received their best &quot;first week&quot; sales of all-time and first Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album Sales Chart as &quot;Violence Unimagined&quot; entered at No. 6 with 14,000 copies sold.

Cannibal Corpse has seen several lineup changes throughout its run, with bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz being the only constant members. The band&#x27;s current lineup includes Mazurkiewicz, Webster, vocalist George Fisher, and guitarists Rob Barrett and Erik Rutan.

==History==
===Formation and early releases===

Cannibal Corpse was formed in December 1988 when members from recently disbanded Buffalo-area death metal bands Beyond Death (Alex Webster and Jack Owen) and Tirant Sin (Paul Mazurkiewicz, Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay) started jamming and writing music together. Bassist Alex Webster recalls &quot;when we got going, there were only a few other bands that you’d really call death metal&quot;. Mazurkiewicz, Barnes and Rusay knew each other from high school, and met Webster and Owen while attending area shows.

Bassist Alex Webster came up with the name Cannibal Corpse. The band played its first show at Buffalo&#x27;s River Rock Cafe in March 1989, shortly after recording a five-song self-titled demo tape, which is now commonly known as &quot;A Skull Full of Maggots&quot;. The band&#x27;s first live performance was opening for thrash metal band Dark Angel. The band signed to Metal Blade Records in July 1989. Mike Faley at Metal Blade wanted to sign the band immediately after reading the song titles in their tracklist. He heard the demo tape after having had it sent to him by the manager of the record store in which Barnes was working. Metal Blade president Brian Slagel recalled, &quot;I thought it was really interesting and cool. Plus, &#x27;A Skull Full of Maggots&#x27; is one of the greatest song titles ever.&quot; Mazurkiewicz said, &quot;It was unbelievable; it was a dream come true. When we signed the contract with Metal Blade, we were only a band for eight months. And here we are having to finish off writing material and record a record.&quot;

The band&#x27;s full-length death metal debut album, &quot;Eaten Back to Life&quot;, was released in August 1990. The band played several local area shows to support the album. Inspired by and seeking the new commercial and recording opportunities of the emerging Florida death metal scene, the band relocated to Tampa. The band released its second full-length album &quot;Butchered at Birth&quot; on July 1, 1991. Webster recalled, &quot;We went over to Europe in ’91 for Butchered At Birth and saw this great reaction from all these people on the other side of the ocean. We were like, ‘Wow, all these people know who we are!’ We were getting two or three hundred people a night at these shows, which was really great for a band with only two albums out. It was a great surprise.” The band members quit their day jobs and dropped out of college during this time.

Friction arose between the band members while touring in support of &quot;Butchered at Birth&quot;. According to Webster, Barnes was managing a tour by himself for the first time, and there were uncertainties regarding how the tour&#x27;s finances were being handled. The band privately dissolved and split into two separate camps during this time. Owen claimed to have been &quot;in the middle&quot; of the situation. Mazurkiewicz and Webster moved into an apartment just four doors down from the band&#x27;s practice space, and composed the music to &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; as a means to vent their frustrations with Barnes.

In 1992, the band toured with Obituary, Malevolent Creation and Agnostic Front. Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation shared a tour bus during this tour, and the latter of which future Cannibal Corpse guitarist Rob Barrett was playing with. According to Barrett, &quot;We were like one big family, and I am pretty sure that is why I got the call to join with them the next year.&quot;

===&quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot; and &quot;The Bleeding&quot;===

The band released their third full-length album &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot; on September 22, 1992, which was said to have showcased &quot;some of the sickest album art and song titles of all time.&quot; Vincent Jeffries of AllMusic said, &quot;the band&#x27;s attention-getting tactics worked perfectly and record sales soared. Cannibal Corpse then became one of the biggest names in the death metal genre -- just as the group&#x27;s discs and live performances were being banned all over the world.&quot; In February 1993, founding guitarist Bob Rusay was fired from the group and was replaced by Malevolent Creation guitarist Rob Barrett. The band has stated that Rusay, whose musical background was in punk rock, was having trouble adapting to the band&#x27;s increasingly technical songwriting style. Webster fired Rusay over a phonecall while the latter was attending a party in celebration of the Buffalo Bills winning the Conference Championship Game(Webster was not a sports fan and was unaware of the poor timing of the band&#x27;s decision). Webster recounted that Rusay hung up on him. Barnes has since stated that he and Owen did not agree with the decision to relieve Rusay of his duties, and expressed regret for having not called him afterward. However, by Webster&#x27;s account, the decision to dismiss Rusay was unanimous. The band has stated that Rusay has made no effort to contact them since his firing, and that he subsequently withdrew from the music scene afterwards. Despite his dismissal from the band, Mazurkiewicz commended Rusay in the Centuries of Torment documentary, calling him a &quot;monumental&quot; musician and saying &quot;it would be cool to see him.&quot; Barnes credited Rusay for having composed some of the most important songs of the band&#x27;s early career. Rusay has since become a golf instructor. Robert Pasbani of Metal Injection said, &quot;More power to Bob. Once leaving the band, he pursued his other passion and made a career out of it.&quot;

The band fired Rusay weeks before they were scheduled to leave for a US tour. Rusay&#x27;s replacement, Rob Barrett, learned the entire setlist in two weeks prior to the tour.

Cannibal Corpse had a cameo appearance in the 1994 Jim Carrey film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, performing an abridged version of their song &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot;.

The band released their fourth studio album &quot;The Bleeding&quot; on April 12, 1994. According to Paul Mazurkiewicz, “&quot;The Bleeding&quot; had begun a process of change in the band. We were developing musically, and the aim was to really take things to the next level. I believe this was obvious with the music that the four of us were coming up with at the time.”

After &quot;The Bleeding&#x27;s&quot; touring cycle had concluded, Barrett convinced the rest of the band to relocate to Florida.

===&quot;Vile&quot;, &quot;Gallery of Suicide&quot; and &quot;The Wretched Spawn&quot;===
In 1995, during recording sessions for their fifth album &quot;Vile&quot;, singer Chris Barnes was dismissed from the band while on tour with Six Feet Under, which was at the time his side project. Barnes and the rest of the band members have since stated the split was due to creative and personal differences within the group that had been mounting for years. Barnes was replaced by Monstrosity singer George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher. According to Barnes in 2025, &quot;There was always tension on a personal level in that band when I was in the band, and probably mostly my fault [&quot;laughs&quot;], so I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it.&quot;

According to Paul Mazurkiewicz, &quot;George was the only person we ever considered. We believed he could do what we wanted. If he had declined, or hadn’t have worked out, I’m not sure what would have happened. It may have been the end of Cannibal Corpse. It was as serious as that.&quot; Webster commented, &quot;I feel that certain people at our record label [Metal Blade] were making it sound like our careers would be over without Chris. And if the only good thing about our band was Chris Barnes, then we weren’t much of a band then, were we?&quot; Mazurkiewicz said, “I’ll admit that Brian Slagel, the head of [Metal Blade Records], wasn’t at all pleased. That was understandable. For any band to fire their vocalist is a really risky step. But we had complete faith in what George had done, and thankfully the fans’ reaction was almost totally positive.&quot;

According to producer Scott Burns, &quot;I thought Barnes was irreplaceable. I had no idea who could take his place, but occasionally, amid the drama and confusion, Rob Barrett would speak up and say, &quot;Let&#x27;s bring in George.&quot; Rob was the easiest to get on board with the decision. I&#x27;ll stress this: The decision to remove Barnes was ultimately the band&#x27;s. Alex and the guys knew I didn&#x27;t think Barnes&#x27;s performance was up to par, but kicking out a band member was not my territory. I wasn&#x27;t thinking about George at the time. I worried about getting the album done and didn&#x27;t see how we would do it without Barnes. I remember the Cannibal guys saying they didn&#x27;t care if Metal Blade dropped them. They wanted to make one record where they were as happy with the vocals as the music. It took a lot of courage to make that call.&quot;

The band released their fifth album &quot;Vile&quot; in 1996. Mazurkiewicz said, &quot;At first I think everybody was a little reluctant. [...] They loved Barnes, but we knew we were bettering the band and were just like, &#x27;Wait until you hear it.&#x27; And I think, for the most part, everybody shut up after that. As soon as we put the album out, we went out on the road, and it was &#x27;Barnes who?&#x27; at that point.&quot;

Barnes went on to perform with the band Six Feet Under as his main project and later, Torture Killer. Barnes designed the original Cannibal Corpse logo, which was changed following his dismissal from the band. There has been speculation regarding whether Barnes had legal ownership rights to the logo. Cannibal Corpse drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz clarified, &quot;He didn’t legally own it, [...] but Chris did draw the thing in the first place. We needed a logo when the band started out, and he came up with something suitable. But once we’d fired him, then he started asking for payment on all CDs and merchandise we sold that carried his logo. Therefore, we decided to come up with a new one for the &quot;Vile&quot; release, which also marked a new era for us. So, it really did the job on two levels.&quot;

In February 1997 Rob Barrett left Cannibal Corpse due to musical differences and rejoined his previous bands Malevolent Creation, Solstice, and HatePlow. Pat O&#x27;Brien, who first appeared on Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s 1998 release &quot;Gallery of Suicide&quot;, replaced Barrett on guitar. Founding guitarist Jack Owen left Cannibal Corpse in 2004 to spend more time on his second band, Adrift, and also joined Deicide in late 2004. Jeremy Turner of Origin substituted on guitar for the band&#x27;s 2004 tour in support of their album &quot;The Wretched Spawn&quot;. Barrett re-joined the band for a concert at the Northwest Deathfest in Washington in 2005.

===&quot;Kill&quot; and &quot;Evisceration Plague&quot;===
&quot;Kill&quot; was released in 2006, and was considered a turning point in the band&#x27;s career. Writing for the follow-up to &quot;Kill&quot; began in November 2007, as indicated in an interview with bassist Alex Webster. &quot;Evisceration Plague&quot;, Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s eleventh studio album, was released February 3, 2009, to a highly positive response from fans. They also released a live DVD in 2011 entitled &quot;Global Evisceration&quot;.

===&quot;Torture&quot;, &quot;A Skeletal Domain&quot; and &quot;Red Before Black&quot;===

Cannibal Corpse released its twelfth studio album, &quot;Torture&quot;, in March 2012. Two early bands of the members reunited for one respective benefit concert each for Tony Lorenzo of the group Sons Of Azrael in January 2012.

In February 2014, Cannibal Corpse announced that they had begun recording their thirteenth album, &quot;A Skeletal Domain&quot;, which was released on September 16. &quot;Sadistic Embodiment&quot; was released as a single in July. All the song titles of the forthcoming album were announced on the same day. The same month, Metal Blade announced the publication of the band&#x27;s authorized biography &quot;Bible Of Butchery&quot;, written by the British author Joel McIver.

In an August 2016 interview, drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz stated that Cannibal Corpse would likely begin recording a new album in 2017. In September 2017, the band announced their fourteenth studio album &quot;Red Before Black&quot;, which was released on November 3.

On December 10, 2018, guitarist Pat O&#x27;Brien was arrested for assault and battery; his bail was set at $50,000. On the eve of the news of his arrest, Cannibal Corpse was announced as one of the supporting acts for Slayer&#x27;s final North American tour, which would take place in the spring of 2019 and also be supported by Lamb of God and Amon Amarth. On January 18, 2019, Cannibal Corpse announced that Hate Eternal frontman and former Morbid Angel guitarist Erik Rutan would fill-in for O&#x27;Brien on their future tours.

===&quot;Violence Unimagined&quot; and &quot;Chaos Horrific&quot;===

Cannibal Corpse entered the studio in June 2020 to begin recording their fifteenth studio album. On February 1, 2021, the band announced that the album, &quot;Violence Unimagined&quot;, would be released on April 16. They released a music video for the song &quot;Inhumane Harvest&quot; from the album in February. The music video was largely inspired by the &quot;Saw&quot; movie franchise. The band also announced that live guitarist Erik Rutan has officially joined the band full-time, in spite of that it is currently uncertain as to whether or not lead guitarist O&#x27;Brien will return to the group following his 2018 legal troubles.

By January 2023, Cannibal Corpse had begun working on their sixteenth studio album, which was listed by &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;55 Most Anticipated Albums&quot; of the year. On June 22, 2023, the band released a new single &quot;Blood Blind&quot; and announced their next record, &quot;Chaos Horrific&quot;, would be released on September 22, 2023.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and instrumentation===
Cannibal Corpse is ultimately a death metal band. Various publications have also classified the band as brutal death metal, old school death metal and speed metal.

The band&#x27;s overall style is described as &quot;brutally aggressive but melodic.&quot; Guitarist Rob Barrett said &quot;You can be melodic without having it sound happy or triumphant. We try to go for the more uglier sounding stuff.&quot; The band&#x27;s early releases are recognized for their rawness, and have been described as being &quot;live sounding.&quot; Bassist Alex Webster commented, &quot;I guess there’s little things I’d consider mistakes on [the early albums], but that captures something -- It gives them that live feel.&quot; A great deal of the band&#x27;s early material was composed by original guitarist Bob Rusay, including tracks such as &quot;Skull Full of Maggots,&quot; &quot;Post-Mortal Ejaculaton,&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Cemetery.&quot; His musical background was in punk rock, and his writing style was described by his bandmates as abrasive, unorthodox, and &quot;offbeat.&quot; The guitar tone on early Cannibal Corpse releases, such as &quot;Butchered at Birth&quot;, has been characterized as a &quot;beehive-wall of white noise.&quot; The band&#x27;s later releases are generally considered to be more rhythmically and melodically complex, which was partially the result of Alex Webster&#x27;s desire to explore the &quot;technical side of music,&quot; beginning with &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot;. According to Joel McIver of MusicRadar, &quot;behind the horrible song titles, lyrics and artwork lies a band of unexpected subtlety and skill.&quot;

The band&#x27;s early releases are described as &quot;a progressively over-the-top approach to gore-themed death metal that pushed the envelope in every imaginable way, from cover art to song titles to the music itself.&quot; In reviews of early albums, critics have made note of the unintelligible, &quot;thundering,&quot; &quot;grunting&quot; death growls of vocalist Chris Barnes, who was called &quot;one of the best growlers in the business&quot;. Founding guitarist Jack Owen described the band&#x27;s first four albums: &quot;&quot;Eaten&quot; is thrashy, &quot;Butchered&quot; is overwritten but in a good way, &quot;Tomb&quot; is abrasive and violent, and then &quot;The Bleeding&quot; was like &#x27;okay slow it down and concentrate.&quot; He also said, &quot;You can hear everyone’s writing style in their own songs.&quot; The writing process for the band&#x27;s early releases were largely collaborative efforts. However, by the time of the writing for &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot;, the band members began composing more material on their own, and beginning with &quot;Vile&quot;, songwriting credits began being attributed to individual band members.

Despite the increasing technical proficiency and polish on the band&#x27;s albums, their overall style has remained relatively unchanged, &quot;in other words, zero chance of [any] stylistic experimentation -- [they] like things just the way they are,&quot; according to Greg Prato of AllMusic. According to former guitarist Pat O&#x27;Brien, &quot;There are certain areas where we&#x27;re not going to be able to go where other bands have gone. But we don&#x27;t want to; we&#x27;re Cannibal Corpse and we&#x27;re just gonna do what we do.&quot; In an interview with Invisible Oranges, Webster explained, &quot;Unless you’re an experimental metal band by nature, people don’t really want that experimentation, I don’t think. They want us to try and out-do what we’ve done – I don’t think people want us to stand still and put out the same album again and again but I think what they want is something stylistically consistent and hopefully even a little better than the last album. When bands go too far away from their style it’s generally not well received in the metal community. Consistency is a big part of our genre.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, he said, &quot;Some of the side projects I’ve done have allowed me to stretch out a little bit more [in terms of style], but Cannibal is really about being a big, heavy rhythm machine, and stepping out too much might detract from that.&quot;

The band&#x27;s songwriting makes use of hooks in both its guitar riffs and vocal cadences. Webster said, &quot;We do not mind writing hooks, as long as they are super heavy hooks. [...] We want the songs to be memorable, as long as there is no sacrifice in the level of heaviness. [...] And those two things should not have to be exclusive. I think you can have really catchy things that are all really heavy. I mean if we can manage to write some lyrics that are going to make you want to remember them and sing along to them each time they come around, then mission accomplished I think right?&quot;

Chris Barnes&#x27; vocals on early Cannibal Corpse albums have been described as &quot;indecipherable growls,&quot; while opting for a more intelligible style on &quot;The Bleeding&quot;. Barnes&#x27; vocals were generally characterized by a slower, groovier delivery style, while current vocalist George Fisher is noted for his highly intelligible, rapid-fire vocal delivery on later Cannibal Corpse releases, such as &quot;Vile&quot; and &quot;Kill&quot;.

According to Guitar World, &quot;Webster’s galloping three-finger technique unlocks speed and accuracy that other bassists can only dream of; remarkably, he achieves great attack and clarity without the need for a pick.&quot;

===Lyrical themes===

The band&#x27;s lyrics and song titles draw heavily on horror fiction, horror films and true crime. &quot;Loudwire&quot; wrote, &quot;Cannibal Corpse have so much gore in their songs that it&#x27;s hard to think of any other band so hyper-focused on tales of people getting killed in gruesome ways.&quot; In the early years of the Florida death metal scene, the group was considered one of the most shocking for its transgression of taste in its depiction of torture, murder, and mutilation, often in highly sexual, misogynistic and sadistic terms. Music journalist T Coles assessed, &quot;of the myriad of styles that emerged in this time, Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s was the least subtle.&quot; The band&#x27;s lyrics are described as &quot;parading a revolting fascination with the human body,&quot; drawing comparisons to Carcass, albeit &quot;with a vividly cinematic perspective.&quot; According to Alex Webster, &quot;We saw that a lot of bands in Florida seemed to have more of a darker, anti-religion thing going on, so we decided to do the gore thing with the art and lyrics.&quot; George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher stated that the band does not sing about religion or politics, and described the band&#x27;s songs as &quot;short stories&quot; that could be converted into horror films. He said, &quot;We like gruesome, scary movies, and we want the lyrics to be like that.&quot;

The lyrics of original vocalist Chris Barnes have been described as &quot;ludicrously over the top.&quot; Examples of macabre song titles from the band&#x27;s early releases include “Entrails Ripped From a Virgin’s Cunt,” “Fucked With a Knife,” &quot;Addicted to Vaginal Skin,&quot; &quot;Meat Hook Sodomy&quot; and “Post Mortal Ejaculation.” According to sociologist Natalie J. Purcell, &quot;the lyrics of these songs contain terrifying lines describing morbid urges to slaughter and sexually exploit others, particularly the weak. Perhaps these songs are especially disturbing because they relate such tales from the perspective of the perpetrator.&quot; Webster is quoted saying &quot;We’re not trying to make a happy story; we’re trying to make a negative, frightening story, and that requires sometimes very disturbing imagery. Chris never wanted to limit [himself], and he didn’t. You can see it in the lyrics that he wrote. He had no limits and some of it is really disturbing for that reason, but it’s what he felt he needed to do.&quot;

According to Jon Weiderhorn of Loudwire, &quot;what separated [Cannibal Corpse] from other death metal bands were the grizzly lyrics [...] the lyrical extremism matched the graphic subject matter, an aesthetic that helped fuel the development of the even more extreme subgenre goregrind.&quot; In his review of &quot;The Bleeding&quot;, Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic explained, &quot;it&#x27;s worth noting for novices that this stuff isn&#x27;t for the lighthearted and shouldn&#x27;t be taken too seriously, even if songs titles like &quot;She Was Asking for It&quot; perhaps go too far, even for this genre.&quot;

===Influences===
The members of the band were originally inspired by thrash metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, Testament, Dark Angel, S.O.D., Sadus, Sodom, Kreator, D.R.I. and Sacrifice, and early death metal bands such as Deicide, Possessed, Autopsy, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel and Death. Both former vocalist Chris Barnes and current vocalist George Fisher have cited late Death vocalist Chuck Schuldiner as a major influence in their development as vocalists. Jack Owen also stated that he was influenced by Bay Area thrash bands such as Exodus in the beginning, and also stated that the band was influenced by Napalm Death and Sepultura. Webster has stated that the band was fond of early black metal bands such as Venom and Bathory in its early days as well, and Owen cited Celtic Frost as an early influence. Drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz said, &quot;Nothing inspired me other than what we were doing. We were narrow-minded in those days. If it wasn&#x27;t death metal, we weren&#x27;t listening to it.&quot; On &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot;, the band began drawing more technical and progressive influences from Florida death metal acts such as Atheist and Cynic. On the &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; EP, the band paid tribute to English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, covering the song &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; from their 1983 album &quot;Born Again&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==
Alex Distefano of &quot;OC Weekly&quot; said Cannibal Corpse are &quot;hands down, the undisputed kings of death metal.&quot; Quentin Thane Singer of &quot;Forbes&quot; said Cannibal Corpse are &quot;by and large the face of the death metal sub-genre&quot; and &quot;one of metal’s most notorious and celebrated bands.&quot; Cannibal Corpse has been called &quot;one of metal&#x27;s goriest, most vile outfits.&quot; MusicRadar included the band on the site&#x27;s list of the &quot;scariest&quot; bands or artists. Greg Prato of AllMusic said, &quot;For the most part, as far as the genre of death metal goes, there is Cannibal Corpse, and there is a bunch of copycats.&quot; Bands known for emulating the band&#x27;s sound during the 1990s have been dubbed &quot;Cannibal Clones&quot; by some publications. According to Chris Dick of Decibel, &quot;I used to get alot of demos back then and 9 out of 10 bands clearly had listened to &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot;.&quot; Cannibal Corpse has been cited as an influence by extreme metal and heavy metal bands of numerous subgenres, including The Black Dahlia Murder, Disgorge, Whitechapel, All Shall Perish, Suicide Silence, Carnifex, Slipknot, As I Lay Dying, All That Remains and Escape the Fate.

==Controversy and censorship==
Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s lyrics, song titles, album covers and merchandise artwork frequently feature transgressive and macabre imagery, including depictions of extreme violence, which the band has always defended as artistic expression that is clearly fictional. Joel McIver of &quot;The Quietus&quot; wrote, &quot;Almost as depressing as the song themes is the regularity with which the members of Cannibal Corpse have been forced to explain that a) no, they don’t take their violent lyrics seriously, b) no, they don’t advise that anyone tries these things at home and c) no, they themselves are not violent or in any way generally extreme as human beings.&quot; Bassist Alex Webster commented, &quot;most Western music is people singing from the heart — singing to a girlfriend, so a lot of people are freaked out by our songs&quot;. The band&#x27;s album art (most often by Vincent Locke) and lyrics, drawing heavily on horror fiction and horror films, are highly controversial. At various points in the band&#x27;s career, several countries, such as Germany and Russia, have banned the group from performing within their borders, or have banned the sale and display of original Cannibal Corpse album covers.

Webster recalled, &quot;It got to the point where it entered global politics. That&#x27;s something I never imagined, and I never heard [Senator] Joe Lieberman actually say these words, but he said this about us: &quot;[Cannibal Corpse] is . They have a song about having sex with a severed head.&quot; I wish I could have heard him say that shit. I&#x27;d love that sound bite.&quot; Original vocalist Chris Barnes, who wrote the lyrics to the band&#x27;s first four albums, said: &quot;I never did anything for controversy. That was more a nuisance. I wanted to just write something that was exciting to me. Controversy was secondary.&quot; According to Metal Blade Records president Brian Slagel, &quot;there were times in Europe that were really scary, to the point where the local government said if they played their songs then [they] would arrest them immediately.&quot;

Current vocalist George Fisher has explained that death metal is best understood as &quot;art&quot; and claims that far more violent art can be found at the Vatican, pointing out that such depictions are arguably more transgressive because they actually happened. On the same topic, George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher stated the band does not sing about religion or politics, and that the band&#x27;s songs are simply &quot;short stories&quot; that could be converted into horror films. He said: &quot;Really, that&#x27;s all it is. We like gruesome, scary movies, and we want the lyrics to be like that. Yeah, it&#x27;s about killing people, but it&#x27;s not promoting it at all. Basically these are fictional stories, and that&#x27;s it. And anyone who gets upset about it is ridiculous.&quot; Webster also said, &quot;It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re maniacs. People from outside the death metal scene get a little spooked sometimes because they just don&#x27;t understand we&#x27;re just doing this for entertainment. It&#x27;s really ugly entertainment, but if we enjoy it, and it&#x27;s harmless, why not?&quot;

In response to accusations that his band&#x27;s lyrics desensitize people to violence, Alex Webster argued death metal fans enjoy the music only because they know the violence depicted in its lyrics is not real: &quot;If you really saw someone get their brains bashed in right in front of you, I think it would have a pretty dramatic impact [...] you&#x27;d react to it, no matter how many movies you&#x27;ve watched or how much gore metal you&#x27;ve listened to [...] even though we&#x27;ve got crazy entertainment now, our social realities are actually a bit more civilized than they were back then [...] we&#x27;re not hanging people or whipping them in the street and I think that&#x27;s positive improvement for any society&quot;. He also believes the violent lyrics can have positive value, saying &quot;it&#x27;s good to have anger music as a release.&quot; George Fisher further explained, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing ever serious. We&#x27;re not thinking of anybody in particular that we&#x27;re trying to kill, or harm or anything.&quot; When asked about his feelings regarding performing some of Barnes&#x27; more extreme lyrics as the father of two daughters, George Fisher assessed, &quot;If one of my daughters went to college and was raped or something [...] would I then want to play those songs on stage? I don’t know. I’d have to cross that bridge. I can understand how some people would be like, “If it’s happening with you and your daughters, you should feel that uncomfortable with everybody,” and I don&#x27;t have a problem with at least listening to people&#x27;s opinions about it.&quot;

===United States===

In May 1995, then-US Senator Bob Dole accused Cannibal Corpse—along with hip hop acts including the Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew—of undermining the national character of the United States. Vocalist George Fisher recalled, &quot;people were bitching us out on TV but it was like ‘cool, you’re not hurting us and you’re telling millions of people who we are’ – good job. ‘Undermining the youth’ – yeah, because we want people to get arrested and not come to our shows. We want regular jobs – great plan!”

A year later, the band came under fire again, this time as part of a campaign by William Bennett, Senator Joe Lieberman, then-Senator Sam Nunn, and National Congress of Black Women chair C. Delores Tucker to get major record labels—including Time Warner, Sony, Thorn-EMI, PolyGram and Bertelsmann—to &quot;dump 20 recording groups [...] responsible for the most offensive lyrics&quot;.

===Australia===

As of October 23, 1996, the sale of any Cannibal Corpse audio recording then available was banned in Australia and all copies of such had been removed from music shops. At the time, the Australian Recording Industry Association and the Australian Music Retailers Association were implementing a system for identifying potentially offensive records, known as the &quot;labelling code of practice&quot;.

All ten of Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s albums, the live album &quot;Live Cannibalism&quot;, the boxed set &quot;15 Year Killing Spree&quot;, the EP &quot;Worm Infested&quot;, and the single &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; were re-released in Australia between 2006 and 2007, finally classified by ARIA and allowed for sale in Australia. However, they are all &quot;restricted&quot; and only sold to those over 18 years of age. Some are sold in &quot;censored&quot; and &quot;uncensored&quot; editions, which denotes the change of cover art. Despite this, when displayed in some stores, even the &quot;uncensored&quot; editions are censored manually.

After discussion of banning them from touring, Australian comedy act The Chaser did a lounge music version of their song &quot;Rancid Amputation&quot; on their show &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, arguing that being able to perform the same song as lounge music on television proves that the music, and not the lyrics, is the problem.

===Germany===
In Germany, numerous albums have been indexed by the Federal Agency for Child and Youth Protection in the Media, which means that these albums may only be offered and sold to adults and must disappear from regular retail outlets.

* &quot;Eaten Back to Life&quot; (1990), on the index since August 1995
* &quot;Tomb of the Mutilated&quot; (1992), on the index since November 1995
* &quot;Hammer Smashed Face&quot; EP (1993), on the index since November 1995
* &quot;Worm Infested&quot; EP (2003), on the index since January 2005
* &quot;Evisceration Plague&quot; (2009), on the index since April 2010

The indexed songs may only be played in front of an adult audience and the organizer must ensure that no minors attend the event by means of an age check.

Some albums have even been confiscated by the courts and may no longer even be sold to adults.

* &quot;Butchered at Birth&quot; (1991), on the index since October 1991, confiscated since 1994
* &quot;Created to Kill&quot; (2000, a bootleg release consisting of demo recordings), on the index since August 2011, confiscated since November 2012
* &quot;Torture&quot; (2012), on the index since December 2012, confiscated since December 2013
* &quot;Vile&quot; (1996), on the index since September 2015, confiscated since July 2017

In a 2004 interview, George Fisher attempted to recall what originally provoked the ban: &quot;A woman saw someone wearing one of our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it. So [now] we can&#x27;t play anything from the first three records. And it really sucks because kids come up and they want us to play all the old songs — and we would — but they know the deal. We can&#x27;t play &#x27;Born in a Casket&#x27; but can play &#x27;Dismembered and Molested&#x27;.&quot;

In a 2019 interview with Christa Jenal, the teacher behind the numerous banning proceedings, spoke about the band: &quot;I have been dealing with the potential for brutalization in society for decades. In this context, I came across the band around 25 years ago because, as a teacher, I saw pupils wearing T-shirts depicting babies on grappling hooks. They were freely available on the market at the time. I&#x27;ve been educating people ever since. Cannibal Corpse is not the only band, but I see it as symptomatic of how far things can go when state institutions turn a blind eye.

===Russia===
Six of the eight planned shows from the band&#x27;s 2014 Russian tour were canceled after protests from local Orthodox activists. A month before the tour, religious activist Dimitry Tsorionov said Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s music was punishable under Russian law because it &quot;incites religious division.&quot; He commented unfavorably on the lyrics, saying they promoted &quot;death, violence, as well as various kinds of sexual perversion.&quot; The gig in Nizhny Novgorod was stopped halfway through the set, after police conducted a search for drugs at the venue. The concert in Saint Petersburg was canceled at the last minute because of unspecified &quot;technical reasons&quot;, OMON arrived shortly after and arrested eighteen concertgoers. Cannibal Corpse members stated that Russian authorities threatened to detain the members if they performed because they did not have the correct work visas.

<text>Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. It is based on &quot;Tevye the Dairyman&quot; and other short stories by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family&#x27;s lives. He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually evicts the Jews from their village.

The original Broadway production of the show, which opened in 1964, had the first musical theatre run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. &quot;Fiddler&quot; held the record for the longest-running Broadway musical for almost 10 years until &quot;Grease&quot; surpassed its run. The production was extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It won nine Tony Awards, including best musical, score, book, direction and choreography. It spawned five Broadway revivals and a highly successful 1971 film adaptation and has enjoyed enduring international popularity. It has also been a popular choice for school and community productions.

==Background==
&quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; is based on a series of stories by Sholem Aleichem about his character Tevye the Dairyman, which he wrote in Yiddish between 1894 and 1914 about Jewish life in a village in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia at the turn of the 20th century. The stories are based on Aleichem&#x27;s own upbringing near Kyiv (fictionalized as Yehupetz). It is also influenced by &quot;Life is with People&quot;, by Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog. Aleichem wrote a dramatic adaptation of the stories that he left unfinished at his death, but which was produced in Yiddish in 1919 by the Yiddish Art Theater and made into a film in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, a musical based on the stories, called &quot;Tevye and his Daughters&quot;, was produced off-Broadway by Arnold Perl. Rodgers and Hammerstein and then Mike Todd briefly considered bringing this musical to Broadway but dropped the idea.
Investors and some in the media worried that &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; might be considered &quot;too Jewish&quot; to attract mainstream audiences. Other critics considered that it was too culturally sanitized, &quot;middlebrow&quot; and superficial; Philip Roth, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, called it &quot;shtetl kitsch&quot;. For example, it portrays the local Russian officer as sympathetic, instead of brutal and cruel, as Sholom Aleichem had described him. Aleichem&#x27;s stories ended with Tevye alone, his wife dead and his daughters scattered; at the end of &quot;Fiddler&quot;, the family members are alive, and most are emigrating together to America. The show found the right balance for its time, even if not entirely authentic, to become &quot;one of the first popular post-Holocaust depictions of the vanished world of Eastern European Jewry&quot;. Harold Prince replaced the original producer Fred Coe and brought in director/choreographer Jerome Robbins. The writers and Robbins considered naming the musical &quot;Tevye&quot;, before landing on a title suggested by various paintings by Marc Chagall (&quot;Green Violinist&quot; (1924), &quot;Le Mort&quot; (1924), &quot;The Fiddler&quot; (1912)) that also inspired the original set design. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;title of the musical does not refer to any specific painting&quot;.

During rehearsals, one of the stars, Jewish actor Zero Mostel, feuded with Robbins, whom he held in contempt because Robbins had cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee and hid his Jewish heritage from the public. (Mostel, conversely, was admired for his confrontational testimony before the committee that led to his blacklisting in the 1950s.) Other cast members also had run-ins with Robbins, who reportedly &quot;abused the cast, drove the designers crazy [and] strained the good nature of Hal Prince&quot;.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman with five daughters, explains the customs of the Jews in the Russian shtetl of Anatevka in 1905, where their lives are as precarious as the perch of a fiddler on a roof (&quot;Tradition&quot;). At Tevye&#x27;s home, everyone is busy preparing for the Sabbath meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde, orders their daughters, Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke, about their tasks. Yente, the village matchmaker, arrives to tell Golde that Lazar Wolf, the wealthy butcher, a widower older than Tevye, wants to wed Tzeitel, the eldest daughter. The next two daughters, Hodel and Chava, are excited about Yente&#x27;s visit, but Tzeitel illustrates how it could have bad results (&quot;Matchmaker, Matchmaker&quot;). A girl from a poor family must take whatever husband Yente brings, but Tzeitel wants to marry her childhood friend, Motel the tailor.

Tevye is delivering milk, pulling the cart himself, as his horse is lame. He asks God: Whom would it hurt &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;? The bookseller tells Tevye news from the outside world of pogroms and expulsions. A stranger, Perchik, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye invites him home for the Sabbath meal and offers him food and a room in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Worried that Yente will find her a husband soon, Tzeitel tells Motel to ask Tevye for her hand before the Sabbath dinner. Motel resists, as he fears Tevye&#x27;s temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker must arrange marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers for the &quot;Sabbath Prayer&quot;.

After the Sabbath, Tevye meets Lazar for a drink at the village inn, assuming mistakenly that Lazar wants to buy his cow. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel – with a rich butcher, his daughter will never want for anything. All join in the celebration of Lazar&#x27;s good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (&quot;To Life&quot;). Outside the inn, Tevye happens upon the Russian Constable, who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a &quot;little unofficial demonstration&quot; in the coming weeks (a euphemism for a minor pogrom). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.

The next morning, after Perchik&#x27;s lessons with the younger sisters, Tevye&#x27;s second daughter Hodel mocks Perchik&#x27;s Marxist interpretation of a Bible story. He, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of Judaism, noting that the world is changing. To illustrate this, he dances with her, defying the prohibition against opposite sexes dancing together. The two begin to fall in love. Later, a hungover Tevye announces that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is devastated and begs Tevye not to force her. Motel arrives and tells Tevye that he is the perfect match for Tzeitel and that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. He promises that Tzeitel will not starve as his wife. Tevye is stunned and outraged at this breach of tradition, but impressed at the timid tailor&#x27;s display of backbone. After some soul-searching (&quot;Tevye&#x27;s Monologue&quot;), Tevye agrees to let them marry, but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (&quot;Miracle of Miracles&quot;).

In bed with Golde, Tevye pretends to be waking from a nightmare. Golde offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye &quot;describes&quot; it (&quot;Tevye&#x27;s Dream&quot;). Golde&#x27;s grandmother Tzeitel returns from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar&#x27;s formidable late wife, Fruma-Sarah (&quot;frum&quot; is a Yiddish word for a devout Jew), rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. The superstitious Golde is terrified, and she quickly counsels that Tzeitel must marry Motel. While returning from town, Tevye&#x27;s third daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some gentile youths. One, Fyedka, protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.

The wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (&quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot;) and the celebration (&quot;The Wedding Dance&quot;). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye&#x27;s daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the &quot;demonstration&quot;. They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreak more destruction in the village. Tevye instructs his family to clean up the mess.

===Act II===

Months later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kyiv to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (&quot;Now I Have Everything&quot;). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents – the world is changing, and he must change with it (&quot;Tevye&#x27;s Rebuttal&quot;). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing &quot;and&quot; his permission.

Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. &quot;Love&quot;, he says, &quot;it&#x27;s the new style.&quot; Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; After dismissing Tevye&#x27;s question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka. News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to Siberia (&quot;The Rumor/I Just Heard&quot;), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (&quot;Far From the Home I Love&quot;).

Time passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (&quot;Chavaleh Sequence&quot;). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about &quot;Anatevka&quot; and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.

As the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for Kraków, unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add &quot;God be with you.&quot; Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play. Tevye beckons with a nod, and the fiddler follows them out of the village.

==Productions==

===Original productions===

Following its tryout at Detroit&#x27;s Fisher Theatre in July and August 1964, then Washington in August to September, the original Broadway production opened on September 22, 1964, at the Imperial Theatre, transferred in 1967 to the Majestic Theatre and in 1970 to the Broadway Theatre, and ran for a record-setting total of 3,242 performances. The production was directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins – his last original Broadway staging. The set, designed in the style of Marc Chagall&#x27;s paintings, was by Boris Aronson. A colorful logo for the production, also inspired by Chagall&#x27;s work, was designed by Tom Morrow. Chagall reportedly did not like the musical.

The cast included Zero Mostel as Tevye the milkman, Maria Karnilova as his wife Golde (both won a Tony for their performances), Beatrice Arthur as Yente the matchmaker, Austin Pendleton as Motel, Bert Convy as Perchik the student revolutionary, Gino Conforti as the fiddler, and Julia Migenes as Hodel. Mostel ad-libbed increasingly as the run went on, &quot;which drove the authors up the wall&quot;. Joanna Merlin originated the role of Tzeitel, which was later assumed by Bette Midler during the original run. Carol Sawyer was Fruma Sarah, Adrienne Barbeau took a turn as Hodel, and Pia Zadora played the youngest daughter, Bielke. Both Peg Murray and Dolores Wilson made extended appearances as Golde, while other stage actors who have played Tevye include Herschel Bernardi, Theodore Bikel and Harry Goz (in the original Broadway run), and Leonard Nimoy. Mostel&#x27;s understudy in the original production, Paul Lipson, went on to appear as Tevye in more performances than any other actor (until Chaim Topol), clocking over 2,000 performances in the role in the original run and several revivals. Florence Stanley took over the role of Yente nine months into the run. The production earned $1,574 for every dollar invested in it. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning nine, including Best Musical, score, book, direction and choreography, and acting awards for Mostel and Karnilova.

The original London West End production opened on February 16, 1967, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and played for 2,030 performances. It starred Topol as Tevye, a role he had previously played in Tel Aviv, and Miriam Karlin as Golde. Alfie Bass, Lex Goudsmit and Barry Martin eventually took over as Tevye. Topol later played Tevye in the 1971 film adaptation, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, and in several revivals over the next four decades. The show was revived in London for short seasons in 1983 at the Apollo Victoria Theatre and in 1994 at the London Palladium.

===Broadway revivals===
The first Broadway revival opened on December 28, 1976, and ran for 176 performances at the Winter Garden Theatre. Zero Mostel starred as Tevye. Robbins directed and choreographed. A second Broadway revival opened on July 9, 1981, and played for a limited run (53 performances) at Lincoln Center&#x27;s New York State Theater. It starred Herschel Bernardi as Tevye and Karnilova as Golde. Other cast members included Liz Larsen, Fyvush Finkel, Lawrence Leritz and Paul Lipson. Robbins directed and choreographed. The third Broadway revival opened on November 18, 1990, and ran for 241 performances at the George Gershwin Theatre. Topol starred as Tevye, and Marcia Lewis was Golde. Robbins&#x27; production was reproduced by Ruth Mitchell and choreographer Sammy Dallas Bayes. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival.

A fourth Broadway revival opened on February 26, 2004, and ran for 36 previews and 781 performances at the Minskoff Theatre. Alfred Molina, and later Harvey Fierstein, starred as Tevye, and Randy Graff, and later Andrea Martin and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, was Golde. Barbara Barrie and later Nancy Opel played Yente, Laura Michelle Kelly played Hodel and Lea Michele played Sprintze. It was directed by David Leveaux. This production replaced Yente&#x27;s song &quot;The Rumor&quot; with a song for Yente and two other women called &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;. The production was nominated for six Tonys but did not win any. In June 2014, to celebrate the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a gala celebration and reunion was held at the Town Hall in New York City to benefit National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene, with appearances by many of the cast members of the various Broadway productions and the 1971 film, as well as Sheldon Harnick, Chita Rivera, Karen Ziemba, Joshua Bell, Jerry Zaks and others.

The fifth Broadway revival began previews on November 20 and opened on December 20, 2015, at the Broadway Theatre, with concept and choreography based on the original by Robbins. Bartlett Sher directed, and Hofesh Shechter choreographed. The cast starred Danny Burstein as Tevye, with Jessica Hecht as Golde, Alexandra Silber as Tzeitel, Adam Kantor as Motel, Ben Rappaport as Perchik, Samantha Massell as Hodel and Melanie Moore as Chava. Judy Kuhn replaced Hecht as Golde on November 22, 2016, for the last five weeks of the run. Designers include Michael Yeargan (sets), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting). Initial reviews were mostly positive, finding Burstein and the show touching. The production was nominated for three Tony Awards but won none. It closed on December 31, 2016, after 463 performances. The U.S./Canadian tour of the Sher-directed production began in 2018 and was interrupted in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic; it resumed in 2021 and continued into 2023. The role of Tevye has been played by Yehezkel Lazarov into 2022, Danny Arnold then assumed the role for several months, and the last months are being played by Jonathan Hashmonay.

===London revivals===
&quot;Fiddler&quot; was first revived in London in 1983 at the Apollo Victoria Theatre (a four-month season starring Topol) and again in 1994 at the London Palladium for two months and then on tour, again starring Topol, and directed and choreographed by Sammy Dallas Bayes, recreating the Robbins production.

After a two-month tryout at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, a London revival opened on May 19, 2007, at the Savoy Theatre starring Henry Goodman as Tevye, Beverley Klein as Golde, Alexandra Silber as Hodel, Damian Humbley as Perchik and Victor McGuire as Lazar Wolf. The production was directed by Lindsay Posner. Robbins&#x27; choreography was recreated by Sammy Dallas Bayes (who did the same for the 1990 Broadway revival), with additional choreography by Kate Flatt.

A revival played at the Menier Chocolate Factory from November 23, 2018, until March 9, 2019, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Andy Nyman as Tevye and Judy Kuhn as Golde. The production transferred to the Playhouse Theatre in the West End on March 21, 2019, with an official opening on March 27. Replacement players included Maria Friedman as Golde and Anita Dobson as Yente. The run closed on November 2, 2019.

A revival played at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre from July 27 to September 28, 2024, directed by Jordan Fein, starring Adam Dannheisser as Tevye, Lara Pulver as Golde, Liv Andrusier as Tzeitel, Georgia Bruce as Hodel, Hannah Bristow as Chava, Beverley Klein as Yente, Dan Wolff as Motel and Daniel Krikler as Perchik. The production was designed by Tom Scutt and choreographed by Julia Cheng. A review by Mark Lawson in &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it five stars out of five and praised its use of the outdoor setting its focus on &quot;the tradition of deflective Jewish humour&quot; and an ending that invites &quot;a broader reflection of displacement and refugee status&quot;. The production is scheduled to transfer to the Barbican Centre for an 8-week season from 24 May to 19 July 2025 before embarking on a UK and Ireland tour.

===Other notable UK productions===
A 2003 national tour played for seven months, with a radical design, directed by Julian Woolford and choreographed by Chris Hocking. The production&#x27;s minimalist set and costumes were monochromatic, and Fruma-Sarah was represented by a 12-foot puppet. This production was revived in 2008 starring Joe McGann.

The show toured the UK again in 2013 and 2014 starring Paul Michael Glaser as Tevye with direction and choreography by Craig Revel Horwood.

A revival played at Chichester Festival Theatre from July 10 to September 2, 2017, directed by Daniel Evans and starring Omid Djalili as Tevye and Tracy-Ann Oberman as Golde.

===Australian productions===
The original Australian production opened on June 16, 1967, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Sydney. It starred Hayes Gordon as Tevye and Brigid Lenihan as Golde. The production ran for two years. The first professional revival tour was staged by the Australian Opera in 1984 with Gordon again playing Tevye. A young Anthony Warlow played Fyedka.

In 1998, 2005, 2006 and 2007, Topol recreated his role as Tevye in Australian productions, with seasons in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Wellington and Auckland. The musical was again revived in Melbourne and Sydney in 2015–2016 with Anthony Warlow as Tevye, Sigrid Thornton as Golde and Lior as Motel.

===Other notable North American productions===
&quot;Topol in &#x27;Fiddler on the Roof&#x27;: The Farewell Tour&quot; opened on January 20, 2009, in Wilmington, Delaware. Topol left the tour in November 2009 due to torn muscles. He was replaced by Harvey Fierstein and Theodore Bikel. The cast included Mary Stout, Susan Cella, Bill Nolte, Erik Liberman, Rena Strober, and Stephen Lee Anderson.

National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene mounted a Yiddish adaptation, &quot;Fidler Afn Dakh&quot;, at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City, under the direction of Joel Grey, with a translation by Shraga Friedman that was first used in a 1965 Israeli production. The cast included Jackie Hoffman as Yente, Steven Skybell as Tevye, Daniel Kahn as Pertshik, Stephanie Lynne Mason as Hodel and Raquel Nobile as Shprintze. Previews began on July 4, and opening night was July 15, 2018. The production played through the end of that year. It then transferred to Stage 42, an off-Broadway theatre, with Skybell, Hoffman, Mason and Nobile reprising their roles. Previews began February 11, with opening night on February 21, 2019. Musical staging was by Staś Kmieć (based on the original choreography by Robbins), with set design by Beowulf Boritt, costumes by Ann Hould-Ward, sound by Dan Moses Schreier and lighting by Peter Kaczorowski. The production closed on January 5, 2020. It won the 2019 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical.

===International and amateur productions===

The musical was an international hit, with early productions playing throughout Europe, in South America, Africa and Australia; 100 different productions were mounted in the former West Germany in the first three decades after the musical&#x27;s premiere, and within five years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, 23 productions were staged in the former East Germany; and it was the longest-running musical ever seen in Tokyo. According to BroadwayWorld, the musical has been staged &quot;in every metropolitan city in the world from Paris to Beijing.&quot;

A Hebrew language staging was produced in Tel Aviv by the Israeli impresario Giora Godik in the 1960s. This version was so successful that in 1965 Godik produced a Yiddish version translated by Shraga Friedman. A 2008 Hebrew-language production ran at the Cameri Theatre in Tel Aviv for more than six years. It was directed by Moshe Kepten, choreographed by Dennis Courtney and starred Natan Datner.

&quot;Un violon sur le toît&quot; was produced in French at Paris&#x27;s théâtre Marigny from November 1969 to May 1970, resuming from September to January 1971 (a total of 292 performances) with Ivan Rebroff as Tevye and Maria Murano as Golde. Another adaptation was produced in 2005 at the théâtre Comédia in Paris with Franck Vincent as Tevye and Isabelle Ferron as Golde. The Stratford Shakespeare Festival produced the musical from April to October 2013 at the Festival Theatre directed and choreographed by Donna Feore. It starred Scott Wentworth as Tevye. An Italian version, &quot;Il violinista sul tetto&quot;, with lyrics sung in Yiddish and the orchestra on stage also serving as chorus, was given a touring production in 2004, with Moni Ovadia as Tevye and director; it opened at Teatro Municipale Valli in Reggio Emilia.

The musical receives about 500 amateur productions a year in the US alone.

==Film adaptations and recordings==

A film version was released by United Artists in 1971, directed and produced by Norman Jewison, and Stein adapted his own book for the screenplay. Chaim Topol starred. The film received mostly positive reviews from film critics and became the highest-grossing film of 1971. &quot;Fiddler&quot; received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director for Jewison, Best Actor in a Leading Role for Topol, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Leonard Frey (as Motel; in the original Broadway production, Frey was the rabbi&#x27;s son). It won three, including best score/adaptation for arranger-conductor John Williams.

In the film version, the character of Yente is reduced, and Perchik&#x27;s song to Hodel &quot;Now I Have Everything&quot; is cut and replaced by a scene in Kyiv. The &quot;Chagall color palette&quot; of the original Broadway production was exchanged for a grittier, more realistic depiction of the village of Anatevka.

Theatre historian John Kenrick wrote that the original Broadway cast album released by RCA Victor in 1964, &quot;shimmers – an essential recording in any show lover&#x27;s collection&quot;, praising the cast. The remastered CD includes two recordings not on the original album, the bottle dance from the wedding scene and &quot;Rumor&quot; performed by Beatrice Arthur. In 2020, the recording was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Kenrick writes that while the original Broadway cast version is the clear first choice among recordings of this musical, he also likes the Columbia Records studio cast album with Bernardi as Tevye; the film soundtrack, although he feels that the pace drags a bit; and some of the numerous foreign versions, including the Israeli, German and Japanese casts.

As of 2020, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and producers Dan Jinks and Aaron Harnick were planning a new film adaptation of the musical, with Thomas Kail directing and co-producing, and Steven Levenson penning the screenplay.

==Cultural influence==

The musical&#x27;s popularity has led to numerous references in popular media and elsewhere. A documentary film about the musical&#x27;s history and legacy, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2019.

===Parodies===
Parodies relating to the show have included &quot;Antenna on the Roof&quot; (&quot;Mad&quot; magazine #156, January 1973), which speculated about the lives of Tevye&#x27;s descendants living in an assimilated 1970s suburban America. In the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), Robin Williams parodies &quot;Matchmaker&quot;. In a 1994 &quot;Animaniacs&quot; parody, &quot;Pigeon on the Roof&quot;, the Goodfeathers decide to marry their girlfriends; song parodies include &quot;Scorsese&quot; (&quot;Tradition&quot;), &quot;Egg Hatcher&quot; (&quot;Matchmaker&quot;) and others. In 2001, the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society published a musical theatre and album parody called &quot;A Shoggoth on the Roof&quot;, which sets music from &quot;Fiddler&quot; to a story based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Spanish comedian and TV-host Jose Mota parodied &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; with the song &quot;Si no fuera rico&quot; (&quot;If I weren&#x27;t a rich man&quot;) during his 2008 New Year&#x27;s Eve special.

References to the musical on television have included a 2005 episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; titled &quot;Jews and Chinese Food&quot;, involving a production of the musical. A skit by &quot;The Electric Company&quot; is about a village fiddler with a fear of heights, so he is deemed &quot;Fiddler on the Chair&quot;. In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot; (2003), William Shatner is depicted as playing Tevye in a scene from &quot;Fiddler&quot;. The second episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, in 1996, featured Garth Brooks doing a piece of &quot;If I were a Rich Man&quot; in which he kicks several chickens off the roof. &quot;The Rosie Show&quot;, a 1996 episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;, parodied the dream scene, when Mr. Sheffield fakes a dream to convince Fran not to be a regular on a TV show. A 2011 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Community&quot;, entitled &quot;Competitive Wine Tasting&quot;, included a parody titled &quot;Fiddla, Please!&quot; with an all-black cast dressed in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; costumes, singing &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be Jewish in Russia, Yo&quot;. Chabad.org kicked off their 2008 &quot;To Life&quot; telethon with a pastiche of the fiddle solo and bottle dance from the musical.

Broadway references have included &quot;Spamalot&quot;, where a &quot;Grail dance&quot; sends up the &quot;bottle dance&quot; in &quot;Fiddler&quot;″s wedding scene. In 2001, Chicago&#x27;s Improv Olympic produced a well-received parody, &quot;The Roof Is on Fiddler&quot;, that used most of the original book of the musical but replaced the songs with 1980s pop songs. In 2004 the original Broadway cast of the musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot; and the Broadway 2004 revival cast of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; collaborated for a Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS benefit and produced an approximately 10-minute-long show, &quot;Avenue Jew&quot;, that incorporated characters from both shows, including puppets. The song &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; appears in the direct-to-video animated Disney film &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;.

===Covers===
Songs from the musical have been covered by notable artists. For example, in 1964, jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley recorded the album &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, which featured jazz arrangements of eight songs from the musical. In a retrospective review &quot;AllMusic&quot; awarded the album 4 stars, stating, &quot;Cannonball plays near his peak; this is certainly the finest album by this particular sextet&quot;. That same year, Eydie Gormé released a single of &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, and jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery recorded the same tune for his album &quot;Movin&#x27; Wes&quot;.

In 1999, Knitting Factory Records released &quot;Knitting on the Roof&quot;, a compilation CD featuring covers of &quot;Fiddler&quot; songs by indie and experimental bands such as the Residents, Negativland, and the Magnetic Fields. Indie rock band Bright Eyes recorded an adaptation of &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; on their 2000 album &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot;. &quot;Allmusic&quot; gave the album a favorable review, and the online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; ranked it at number 170 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. In 2005, Melbourne punk band Yidcore released a reworking of the entire show called &quot;Fiddling on Ya Roof&quot;.

Gwen Stefani and Eve covered &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; as &quot;Rich Girl&quot; for Stefani&#x27;s 2004 debut solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; in 2004. The song was inspired by the 1993 British Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One ragga version of the same name. Stefani&#x27;s version reached #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it remained for over six months. It was certified gold by the RIAA and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. It was also covered in 2008 and 2009 by the Capitol Steps, poking fun at Illinois politics, especially then-Governor Rod Blagojevich. The Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps performs the &quot;Bottle Dance&quot; from &quot;Fiddler&quot; as a &quot;recurring trademark&quot;, including at the Drum Corps International World Championships.

===Other===
The song &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; is often played at weddings, and in 2011 Sheldon Harnick wrote two versions of the song, suitable for same-sex weddings, with minor word changes. For example, for male couples, changes include &quot;When did they grow to be so handsome&quot;.

In 2015 a displaced persons camp southwest of Kyiv named Anatevka was built by Chabad Rabbi Moshe Azman to house the Jews fleeing the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Awards==

&quot;Fiddler&quot;″s original Broadway production in 1964 was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning nine, including Best Musical, score, and book, and Robbins won for best direction and choreography. Mostel and Karnilova won as best leading actor and best featured actress. In 1972, the show won a special Tony on becoming the longest-running musical in Broadway history.

Its revivals have also been honored. At the 1981 Tony Awards, Bernardi was nominated as best actor. Ten years later, the 1991 revival won for best revival, and Topol was nominated as best actor. The 2004 revival was nominated for six Tony Awards and three Drama Desk Awards but won none. The 2007 West End revival was nominated for Olivier Awards for best revival, and Goodman was nominated as best actor. The 2019 West End revival won the Olivier Award for best revival, and it received a further 7 nominations.

<text>Practical Magic is a 1998 American romantic fantasy film based on the 1995 novel &quot;Practical Magic&quot; by Alice Hoffman. The film was directed by Griffin Dunne and stars Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing, Aidan Quinn, and Goran Višnjić.

Bullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, descended from a long line of witches. Raised by their aunts after their parents&#x27; death from a family curse, the sisters were taught the uses of practical magic as they grew up. As adults, Sally and Gillian must use their magic to destroy the evil spirit of Gillian&#x27;s abusive boyfriend before it kills them.

The film was released on October 16, 1998. The film grossed $68.3 million worldwide against a $75 million budget. Upon initial release, the film received mixed reviews from critics who found the film&#x27;s combination of different genres, including supernatural fantasy, domestic abuse drama, romantic comedy, and crime procedural, to be jarring. It has since gained a cult following for its cast, soundtrack, and feminist themes. In 2024, a sequel was reported to be in development.

==Plot==

In a small Massachusetts town, the Owens family have been regarded with suspicion for over three centuries due to their ancestor Maria Owens, who survived an attempted execution for witchcraft. Heartbroken when the father of her unborn child never returned to her, Maria cast a spell to prevent herself from ever falling in love again. The spell developed into a curse upon Maria&#x27;s descendants, dooming any man an Owens woman loves.

In the present, Sally and Gillian Owens are taken in by their aunts Frances and Jet after both their parents succumb to the Owens curse. As children, Sally and Gillian are frequently ridiculed by the town&#x27;s schoolchildren. 

After witnessing their aunts cast a love spell for a woman obsessed with her beloved, Sally casts a spell on herself to ensure she will only fall in love with a man who possesses certain impossible traits, with the goal that she will never fall in love. 

Meanwhile Gillian, witnessing the same incident, cannot wait to fall in love. When the girls are teens, Gillian elopes with her boyfriend and leaves for Los Angeles. Before she departs, she and Sally make a blood spell to always be faithful to one another.

Gillian spends the next decade moving from relationship to relationship across the country, while back in Massachusetts, Sally meets and marries a man named Michael. They have two daughters, Kylie and Antonia. 

After Michael is fatally hit by a truck, Sally and her girls go to live with the aunts. Learning that they secretly cast a love spell on her so that she could marry and be happy, Sally says the aunts will never teach her daughters magic.

Gillian unexpectedly tells Sally she has become involved with a dangerously abusive man named Jimmy Angelov. When Sally arrives to rescue her sister, he holds them both hostage in his car. Sally puts belladonna into Jimmy&#x27;s tequila to sedate him, but inadvertently kills him instead. 

The sisters take Jimmy&#x27;s body back to the aunts&#x27; house, where they attempt to resurrect him using a forbidden spell, which causes him to return and attack Gillian. Sally kills him again, and the sisters bury his remains in the garden. 

Sally, Gillian and the aunts have a midnight drinking session in which Jimmy&#x27;s tequila seems to be influencing them to turn against each other; the aunts leave home the following morning, leaving a message to the sisters to &quot;clean up their own mess&quot;.

State investigator Gary Hallett arrives from Tucson, Arizona in search of Jimmy, who is also a serial killer. Gillian tries to make him drink a potion that will make him leave them alone, but Sally&#x27;s daughters realize he is the man of Sally&#x27;s childhood spell and they throw the potion away. 

After Gillian and Sally fight, Sally breaks down and confesses to Gary, only to realize he is the impossible man from her childhood love spell. Unable to deny their attraction, they kiss.

Returning home, Sally discovers Jimmy&#x27;s spirit has possessed Gillian&#x27;s body. Gary sees the spirit emerge. Jimmy tries possessing Gary, but is turned aside by his silver badge. Sally tells Gary he is there because of her spell, the feelings they have for each other are not real, and the family curse will kill him if they pursue a relationship. Gary replies that curses only work if one believes in them, before returning to Tucson.

Jimmy possesses Gillian again and tries killing Sally before Frances and Jet return. Realizing she must embrace magic to save her sister, Sally asks the aid of the townswomen and they form a coven to exorcise Jimmy&#x27;s spirit. They break the Owens curse, exorcising Jimmy&#x27;s spirit and allowing the coven to exile him permanently. 

In Tucson, Gary clears the sisters of any suspicion in Jimmy&#x27;s case and returns to Massachusetts to be with Sally. The Owens women are finally welcomed into the community by the townsfolk, who now accept them as witches.

==Production==
&quot;Practical Magic&quot; was filmed in part on an artificial set in California. Because the film&#x27;s producers decided the house was a big part of the depiction of the Owens culture, a house to accurately represent that vision was built on San Juan Island in the state of Washington. While much of the set from California was brought to that location and placed inside the house, it took nearly a year to perfect the image of the house and the interior. The house, actually only a shell with nothing inside, was built only for this filming and was torn down after filming was completed. The small town scenes were filmed in downtown Coupeville, Washington, a Victorian-era seaside port town located on the south side of Penn Cove on Whidbey Island.

Director Griffin Dunne said he originally had a darker vision for the film. The scene with Sally and Gilly inserting needles into Jimmy was supposed to be much more disturbing and the domestic violence plot line was more intense, but the studio cut the darker material. He expressed interest in a director&#x27;s cut.

According to Sandra Bullock in the DVD commentary, while filming the scene where the Owens women are drunk and slinging insults, the actresses actually got drunk on very bad tequila brought by Kidman.

The cast further stated in the film&#x27;s commentary that they felt supernatural elements of the house started to affect them. Both the cast and crew claimed they heard supernatural noises while filming the coven scene at the end of the film. For the final scene with all of the townspeople at the Owens home, the entire population of the town where filming took place was invited to show up in costume and appear as townsfolk.

==Music==
Composer Michael Nyman&#x27;s score to the film was abruptly replaced with music by Alan Silvestri for the theatrical release. This last-minute change resulted in the release of two soundtracks, although as primarily a compilation album only the two tracks of newly created material were changed. A 50-track demo (the last two tracks being &quot;Convening the Coven&quot; and &quot;Maria Owens&quot;) of Nyman&#x27;s score has been circulating among fans as a bootleg. The complete Nyman score runs 62:30 and contains music that would later appear, in altered form, in &quot;Ravenous&quot; and &quot;The Actors&quot;, as well as a bit of his stepwise chord progression theme from &quot;Out of the Ruins&quot;/&quot;String Quartet No. 3&quot;/&quot;Carrington&quot;/&quot;The End of the Affair&quot;/&quot;The Claim&quot;. &quot;Convening the Coven&quot;, though not &quot;Maria Owens,&quot; was subsequently reissued on &quot;The Very Best of Michael Nyman: Film Music 1980–2001&quot;, and music that uses material related to this piece has not been used elsewhere. &quot;Convening the Coven&quot; became &quot;City of Turin&quot; on &quot;The Glare&quot;.

Singer Stevie Nicks headlined the soundtrack&#x27;s published advertisements, promoting her song &quot;If You Ever Did Believe&quot; and a new recording of her song &quot;Crystal,&quot; both featuring Sheryl Crow on back-up vocals.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Practical Magic&quot; opened at #1 with $13.1 million in ticket sales. The film went on to gross $68.3 million worldwide, less than its $75 million production budget.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Practical Magic&quot; received negative reviews from critics upon release, who panned its inconsistent tone and script. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 26%, with an average score of 4.8/10, based on 101 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Practical Magic&quot;″s jarring tonal shifts sink what little potential its offbeat story may havethough Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock&#x27;s chemistry makes a strong argument for future collaborations.&quot; Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, gives a score of 46 out of 100 reviews based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &#x27;B-&#x27; on an A+ to F scale.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;Practical Magic&quot; a negative review, calling it &quot;a witch comedy so slapdash, plodding, and muddled it seems to have had a hex put on it.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; spoke of the film&#x27;s unsure tone, &quot;veering uncertainly from horror to laughs to romance&quot;, and opined that the film &quot;is too scary for children and too childish for adults&quot;.

Garth Stahl of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; was more positive, noting that women in dark comedy and depictions of sisterhood are rare in film. He wrote &quot;Practical Magic&quot; &quot;has its flaws. Some scenes are weak, occasionally lines are a little muddled, and there is some plot underdevelopment. Yet it is daring and fun — a frolic for two charming actresses and a dapper film premise&quot;. He concluded &quot;The main source of attraction is undeniably the enchanting and witty witchcraft. It is simultaneously what makes the Owen sisters outcasts and what makes them special. With a few very sharp scenes, including a jazzy dance sequence, &#x27;Practical Magic&#x27; is worth [it]. It is a step toward allowing women to assert themselves in the genre of dark comedy. Now isn&#x27;t that practical.&quot;

Reviewing the film for Amazon, Tom Keogh said, &quot;The film has a variety of tonal changes—cute, scary, glum—that Dunne can&#x27;t always effectively juggle. But the female-centric, celebratory nature of the film (the fantasies, the sharing, the witchy bonds) is infectious, and supporting roles by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing as Kidman and Bullock&#x27;s magical aunts are a lot of fun.&quot;

The film has acquired a cult following over the years. Writing about &quot;Practical Magic&quot;″s legacy in 2018, David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; discussed how the film centers relationships between women through the Owens bloodline as well as in the final scene involving the town&#x27;s women uniting to free Gillian from Jimmy&#x27;s control. He described the film as a mainstream studio feature &quot;that wove dark themes about gender and power into an ostensible crowd-pleasing comedy&quot;, qualities that made it unusual for its time and have contributed to its staying power.

===Audience viewership===

&quot;Practical Magic&quot; entered the Max top 10 films chart, securing the #5 spot just one day after its October 1, 2024 premiere on the streaming platform.

==Accolades ==
==Sequel==
In June 2024, it was announced that a sequel was in development. Bullock and Kidman will return to produce the film with Di Novi and be in talks to star in it. Later that same month, Nicole Kidman confirmed that she and Sandra Bullock would reprise their roles in the sequel. Akiva Goldsman, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original film, would return to write the script. Griffin Dunne hinted that a female director will helm the sequel, while he will serve as an executive producer.

In July 2024, Akiva Goldsman later confirmed that he would be returning to write the sequel. While specific plot details remain under wraps, the sequel will be based on Alice Hoffman&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;The Book of Magic&quot;, the fourth installment in her &quot;Practical Magic&quot; series. Although the timeline is still uncertain, in August 2024, producer Denise Di Novi is optimistic about beginning production next year. In January 2025, Susanne Bier was reportedly in talks to direct the sequel. In February 2025, Kidman mentioned that the sequel was &quot;moving ahead rapidly&quot;.

==In other media==
In 2004, Warner Bros. and CBS produced &quot;Sudbury&quot;, a television pilot written by Becky Hartman Edwards and directed by Bryan Spicer starring Kim Delaney in the role played by Bullock in the film and Jeri Ryan in the role played by Kidman. The series, named for the Sudbury, Massachusetts location of the novel and film, was not picked up.

In 2010, Warner Bros. and ABC Family attempted to develop a prequel television series.

<doc id="89446" wikidata="Q181425" url="?curid=89446" title="Chow Yun-fat">
<text>Chow Yun-fat (born 18 May 1955), previously known as Donald Chow, is a Hong Kong actor and filmmaker. Known for his versatility, encompassing action to melodrama and comedy and historical drama, he is the recipient of various accolades, including three Hong Kong Film Awards for Best Actor and two Golden Horse Awards for Best Actor. In a film career spanning more than forty years, Chow has appeared in over 100 television drama series and films.

Chow was propelled to fame by TVB dramas such as &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Bund&quot; (1980). His first acclaimed film was the Hong Kong political drama &quot;The Story of Woo Viet&quot; (1981), in which he played a Vietnamese refugee struggling to reach the United States. He is known for his collaborations with filmmaker John Woo in five Hong Kong action films: &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), which made Chow a box-office superstar in Asia, &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot; (1987), &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989), &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1991), and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992). He also starred in the video game &quot;Stranglehold&quot; (2007), produced by Woo. Chow also made several popular action films with Hong Kong director Ringo Lam, including &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1987), &quot;Wild Search&quot; (1989), and &quot;Full Contact&quot; (1992). Chow is credited for bringing Hong Kong gangster films to world prominence. 

His other notable Hong Kong and Chinese films include &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; (1989), &quot;All About Ah-Long&quot; (1990), &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006), &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; (2010), &quot;From Vegas to Macau&quot; (2014), and &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; (2018). Chow made his Hollywood debut in &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (1998). He is also known in the West for &quot;The Corruptor&quot; (1999), &quot;Anna and the King&quot; (1999), &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; (2003), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007).

== Early life and education ==
Chow was born in Lamma Island, Hong Kong, to Chow Yung-wan, who worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker, and Chan Lai-fong, who was a cleaning lady and vegetable farmer. Chow grew up in a farming community on Lamma Island, in a house with no electricity. He woke up at dawn each morning to help his mother sell herbal jelly and Hakka tea-pudding on the streets; in the afternoons, he went to work in the fields. His family moved to Kowloon when he was ten. At 17, Chow left school to help support the family by doing odd jobs including a bellboy, postman, camera salesman, and taxi driver. 

== Career ==
In 1973, the 18-year-old Chow responded to a newspaper advertisement for TVB&#x27;s actor training program. After a one-year training, he signed a three-year contract with the TV station and made his acting debut in soap operas. He gained recognition in such dramas as &quot;The Killer&quot; (1976) and &quot;Hotel&quot; (1976). He had his breakout role in &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly&quot; (1979), followed by &quot;The Bund,&quot; a series about the gangsters in 1930s Shanghai. The latter made Chow a star across Asia.
Although Chow continued his TV success, his goal was to become a film actor. He made his film debut in 1976 after signing an exclusive contract with Goldig Films, then the third largest film company in Hong Kong. Goldig Films, founded and solely-funded by Indonesian Chinese businessman Gouw Hiap Kian, produced and distributed over 100 movies from 1972 to 1982. However, Chow&#x27;s occasional ventures into low-budget films in the 1980s after ones by Goldig were disastrous. Most of Chow&#x27;s movies with Goldig Films in the 1970s achieved high gross revenues of over HK$1 million per movie, which is a better box office performance than his movies in early 1980s, such as &quot;Modern Heroes&quot; (江湖檔案), &quot;Soul Ash&quot; (灰靈), &quot;The Bund&quot; (上海灘), &quot;The Bund Part 2&quot; (上海灘續集).

Success came when he teamed up with film director John Woo in the 1986 gangster action-melodrama &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, which swept the box offices in Asia and established Chow and Woo as megastars. &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; won him his first Best Actor award at the Hong Kong Film Awards. It was the highest-grossing film in Hong Kong history at the time, and set a new standard for Hong Kong gangster films. Taking the opportunity, Chow quit TV entirely. With his new image from &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, he made many more &#x27;gun fu&#x27; or &#x27;heroic bloodshed&#x27; films, such as &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot; (1987), &quot;Prison on Fire&quot; (1987), &quot;Prison on Fire II (1991)&quot;, &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989), &quot;A Better Tomorrow 3&quot; (1990), &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992) and &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1987), an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;.

Chow may be best known for playing honorable tough guys, whether cops or criminals, but he has also starred in comedies like &quot;Diary of a Big Man&quot; (1988) and &quot;Now You See Love, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; (1992) and romantic blockbusters such as &quot;Love in a Fallen City&quot; (1984) and &quot;An Autumn&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1987), for which he was named Best Actor at the Golden Horse Awards. He brought together his disparate personae in the 1989 film &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;, directed by the prolific Wong Jing, in which he was by turns a suave charmer, a broad comedian, and an action hero. The film surprised many, became immensely popular, broke Hong Kong&#x27;s all-time box office record, and spawned a series of gambling films as well as several comic sequels starring Andy Lau and Stephen Chow. The often tough demeanour and youthful appearance of Chow&#x27;s characters has earned him the nickname &quot;Babyface Killer&quot;.
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; proclaimed Chow Yun-Fat &quot;the coolest actor in the world&quot;. In the mid &#x27;90s, Chow moved to Hollywood in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to duplicate his success in Asia. His first two films, &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Corruptor&quot; (1999), were box office failures. In his next film &quot;Anna and the King&quot; (1999), Chow teamed up with Jodie Foster, but the film underperformed at the box office. Chow accepted the role of Li Mu-bai in the (2000) film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot; It became a winner at both the international box office and the Oscars. In 2003, Chow came back to Hollywood and starred in &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot;. In 2004, Chow made a surprise cameo in director Dayyan Eng&#x27;s Chinese rom-com favourite &quot;Waiting Alone&quot;; it was the first time he was in a mainland Chinese film. In 2006, he teamed up with Gong Li and Jay Chou in the film &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower,&quot; directed by Zhang Yimou. 

In 2007, Chow played the pirate captain Sao Feng in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;. However, his part was omitted when the movie was shown in mainland China, where, according to Chinese unofficial sources, government censors felt that Chow&#x27;s character &quot;vilified and humiliated&quot; Chinese people. 

From 2014 to 2016, Chow reunited with his &quot;God of Gamblers&quot; director Wong Jing to make the &quot;From Vegas to Macau&quot; franchise. For the part, he lost 13 kg within 10 months. In 2018, he co-starred with Aaron Kwok in &quot;Project Gutenberg,&quot; which earned him another Best Actor nomination at the 38th Hong Kong Film Awards.

In 2023, he became the second Hong Kong actor, after Tony Leung, to be named Asian Filmmaker of the Year at the 28th Busan International Film Awards.

== Personal life ==
Chow married twice. In 1983, he married Candice Yu, an actress with Asia Television; the marriage only lasted nine months. In 1986, Chow married Singaporean Jasmine Tan. After having a stillborn daughter in 1991, they decided not to have children. Chow has a goddaughter, Celine Ng, a former child model.

Despite being famous for using martial arts moves on the screen, Chow, in a conversation with &quot;Metro&quot;, revealed that he relied heavily on stunt coordinators and was not all as ‘athletic’ as it seemed, mentioning, “I am not like Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan”.

In 2018, Chow’s wife Jasmine Tan disclosed that Chow’s net worth was HK$ 5.6b, which was not verified by any third party. Chow said he would donate 99% of his wealth to charity. 

Chow maintains a modest public image by frequenting food stalls and public transportation in Hong Kong. Chow ran a half marathon in less than 2 hours 30 minutes in November 2023.

In October 2014, Chow voiced support for students in the Umbrella Movement, a civil rights movement for universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

== Filmography ==

Chow has appeared in over 95 films and over 25 television series.

== Bibliography ==
On 26 June 2008, Chow released his first photo collection, which includes pictures taken on the sets of his films. Proceeds from the book&#x27;s sales were donated to Sichuan earthquake victims. It is published by Louis Vuitton.

<text>The Six Wives of Henry VIII is a series of six television plays produced by the BBC and first transmitted between 1 January and 5 February 1970. The series later aired in the United States on CBS from 1 August to 5 September 1971 with narration added by Anthony Quayle. The series was rebroadcast in the United States without commercials on PBS as part of its &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; series.

The series spawned a sequel, &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (1971), starring Glenda Jackson, which included several performers reprising their roles in the first episode: Ronane, Hepton, Dignam and Crutchley. A prequel, &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot; (1972), starring James Maxwell and Norma West as Henry&#x27;s parents, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.

&quot;Jane Seymour&quot; writer Ian Thorne adapted the series into the film &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot; (1972). Michell reprises his role, with the wives being portrayed by Frances Cuka, Charlotte Rampling, Jane Asher, Jenny Bos, Lynne Frederick and Barbara Leigh-Hunt. Cromwell is played by Donald Pleasence, and the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk by Michael Gough and Brian Blessed.

<text>The [[Château]] d&#x27;Oiron is located in Oiron, in the Deux-Sèvres &quot;département&quot; of western France. It has its origins in the 15th century war with the English for control of France when a victorious Charles VII of France gave the domain and great forest of Oiron to Guillaume Gouffier who became governor of Touraine. This château is the background for Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tale, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;. King Louis XIV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Montespan was one of the residents in the place.

==History==
Today, Oiron is only a short drive from the royal châteaux in the Val de Loire, but in the 15th century it was considered far removed from the seat of power at the royal domains. Nonetheless, Guillaume Gouffier built a magnificent château and his offspring updated and improved it. In 1538, his daughter-in-law, Helene de Hengest, was responsible for the construction of a collegiate church adjacent to the château. In 1551, Henry II and his entire court were guests of Claude Gouffier who had been granted the title Marquis de Caravaz. Claude Gouffier served as the model for Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Marquis de Carabas&quot; in his story, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

Two generations later, another Gouffier was exiled from the king&#x27;s court by Cardinal Richelieu in 1620. In the mid 17th century, Charlotte Gouffier became enamored with the renowned intellect, Blaise Pascal (1623–62), who spent considerable time at the Château d&#x27;Oiron. After Pascal died, Charlotte Gouffier married Francois d&#x27;Aubusson, the duc de La Feuillade, who enhanced the castle with his wealth and connections to Louis XIV. With the renovations, the castle ended up with a main building and two long projecting wings, one of which is a Renaissance structure built over a cloister. One of the galleries contains one of the most prestigious works of art from the French Renaissance period.

The Duc de La Feuillade&#x27;s son sold the château to Louis XIV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Montespan who lived there for the rest of her life. Her son had little interest in the property as he preferred to be much closer to the royal court so in 1736 he sold the château to the Duc de Villeroi. After that, the château went into severe decline and in 1793 was ransacked by Revolutionaries. For many years the château lay abandoned until the government of France took possession just before World War II eventually converting it to a museum.

Recognized worldwide, the museum is dedicated to contemporary art. In 1993, &quot;The Year of Solar Burns&quot; by conceptual artist Charles Ross was commissioned by the French Ministry of Culture for permanent installation in the Château d&#x27;Oiron. The château has been listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the Ministry of Culture since 1923.

<doc id="89452" wikidata="Q162112" url="?curid=89452" title="Norman Bethune">
<text>Henry Norman Bethune (; March 4, 1890 – November 12, 1939; ) was a Canadian thoracic surgeon, early advocate of socialized medicine, and member of the Communist Party of Canada. Bethune came to international prominence first for his service as a frontline trauma surgeon supporting the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, and later supporting the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s (CCP) Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Bethune helped bring modern medicine to rural China, treating both sick villagers and wounded soldiers.

Bethune was responsible for developing a mobile blood-transfusion service for frontline operations in the Spanish Civil War. He later died of blood poisoning after accidentally cutting his finger while operating on wounded Chinese soldiers.

Bethune&#x27;s service to the CCP earned him the respect of Mao Zedong, who wrote a eulogy dedicated to Bethune when he died in 1939. His name is honored in China to this day.

== Family history ==
Bethune came from a prominent Scottish Canadian family, whose origins can be traced back to the Bethune/Beaton medical kindred who practised medicine in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era. His great-great-grandfather, the Reverend Doctor John Bethune (1751–1815), the family patriarch, established the first Presbyterian congregation in Montreal, the first five Presbyterian churches in Ontario and was one of the founders of the Presbyterian Church of Canada.

Bethune&#x27;s great-grandfather, Angus Bethune (1783–1858), joined the North West Company (NWC) at an early age and travelled extensively throughout what was the North West of Canada at that time, exploring and trading for furs. Angus Bethune married Louise McKenzie (1793–1833), a Métis woman. Louise McKenzie was the daughter of the Hon. Roderick McKenzie, a prominent NWC partner, and his country wife. Bethune and McKenzie were both stationed at the Fort William fur trade post at the head of Lake Superior. He eventually reached the Pacific at Fort Astoria, Oregon. He became chief factor of the Lake Huron district for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company after the merger of the rival companies. Upon retirement from the HBC in 1839, he successfully ran for a post as an alderman on Toronto City Council.

Bethune&#x27;s grandfather, Norman Bethune, Sr. (1822–92), was educated as a doctor at King&#x27;s College, University of Toronto, and in London, England at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, graduating in 1848 as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He went on to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1860 and practised in Edinburgh until 1869. Upon his return to Canada, he became one of the founders of the Upper Canada School of Medicine, which was incorporated into Trinity College, Toronto and eventually the University of Toronto.

Bethune&#x27;s father, the Rev. Malcolm Nicolson Bethune, led an uneventful life as a small-town pastor, initially at Gravenhurst, Ontario, from 1889 to 1892. His mother was Elizabeth Ann Goodwin, an English immigrant to Canada. Both his parents were very religious, though Bethune himself was an atheist. Bethune grew up with a &quot;fear of being mediocre&quot;, instilled into him by his emotionally strict father and domineering mother.

Bethune was a distant relative of actor Christopher Plummer.

==Early life==

Bethune was born in Gravenhurst, Ontario, on March 4, 1890. His birth certificate erroneously stated March 3. His siblings were his sister Janet and brother Malcolm.

As a youth, Bethune attended Owen Sound Collegiate Institute, graduating in 1907. After a brief period as a primary school teacher in Edgeley, in 1909, he enrolled at the University of Toronto to study physiology and biochemistry. He interrupted his studies for one year in 1911 to be a volunteer labourer-teacher with the Reading Camp Association (later Frontier College) at a remote lumber camp near Whitefish, Sudbury. He returned to the University of Toronto in the fall of 1912, this time in the faculty of medicine.

In 1914, when World War I was declared in Europe, he once again suspended his medical studies after being accepted into the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps. Bethune joined the Canadian Army&#x27;s No. 2 Field Ambulance to serve as a stretcher-bearer in France. He was wounded by shrapnel at the Second Battle of Ypres and sent to an English hospital to recover, repatriating to Canada in October 1915. When he had recuperated from his injuries, he returned to Toronto to complete his medical degree. He received his M.D. in 1916.

== Personal life ==
In 1917, with the war still in progress, Bethune joined the Royal Navy as a Surgeon-Lieutenant at the Chatham Hospital in England. In 1919, he began an internship specializing in children&#x27;s diseases at The Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street, London. Later he went to Edinburgh, where he earned the FRCS qualification at the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1920 he met Frances Penney, whom he married in 1923. After a one-year &quot;Grand Tour&quot; of Europe, during which they spent much of her inheritance, they moved to Detroit, Michigan, where Bethune took up private practice and also took a part-time job as an instructor at the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery.

In 1926 Bethune contracted tuberculosis. He sought treatment at the Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York. At this time, Frances divorced Bethune and returned to her home in Scotland.

In the 1920s the established treatment for tuberculosis was total bed rest in a sanatorium. While convalescing Bethune read about a radical new treatment for tuberculosis called pneumothorax. This involved artificially collapsing the tubercular (diseased) lung, thus allowing it to rest and heal itself. The physicians at the Trudeau thought this procedure was too new and risky, but Bethune insisted on having the operation performed and made a full and complete recovery.

In 1929 Bethune remarried Frances; the best man at the wedding was his friend and colleague Graham Ross. They divorced again, for the final time, in 1933.

In 1928 Bethune joined thoracic surgical pioneer Edward William Archibald, surgeon-in-chief of the McGill University&#x27;s Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. From 1928 to 1936 Bethune perfected his skills in thoracic surgery and developed or modified more than a dozen new surgical tools. His most famous instrument was the Bethune Rib Shears, which remain in use today.
He published 14 articles describing his innovations in thoracic technique. He started his career in surgery at the Toronto General Hospital in 1921.

== Political activities ==
Bethune became increasingly concerned with the socio-economic aspects of disease. As a concerned doctor in Montreal during the economic depression years of the 1930s, Bethune frequently sought out the poor and gave them free medical care. He challenged his professional colleagues and agitated, without success, for the government to make radical reforms of medical care and health services in Canada.

Bethune was an early proponent of socialized medicine and formed the Montreal Group for the Security of People&#x27;s Health. In 1935 Bethune travelled to the Soviet Union to observe firsthand their system of universal free health care. During this year he became a committed Communist and joined the Communist Party of Canada. When returning from the Spanish Civil War to raise support for the Loyalist cause, he openly identified with the Communist cause.

== Spanish Civil War ==
Shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, with the financial backing of the committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, Bethune went to Spain to offer his services to the government (Loyalist) forces. He arrived in Madrid on November 3.

Unable to find a place where he could be used as a surgeon, he seized on an idea which may have been inspired by his limited experience of administering blood transfusions as Head of Thoracic Surgery at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Montreal between 1932 and 1936. The idea was to set up a mobile blood transfusion service by which he could take blood donated by civilians in bottles to wounded soldiers near the front lines. The unit was officially presented to the Republicans in 1937 by Alexander Albert MacLeod under Bethune&#x27;s direction. Though this unit, the &quot;Servicio canadiense de transfusión de sangre&quot;, was not the first of its kind—a similar service had been set up in Barcelona by a Spanish haematologist, Frederic Durán-Jordà, and had been functioning since September—Bethune&#x27;s Madrid-based unit covered a far wider area of operation.

Bethune returned to Canada on June 6, 1937, where he went on a speaking tour to raise money and volunteers for the Spanish Civil War.

Shortly before leaving for Spain, Bethune wrote the following poem, published in the July 1937 edition of &quot;The Canadian Forum&quot;:
== China ==
In January 1938 Bethune travelled to Yan&#x27;an in the Shanbei region of Shaanxi province in China. There he joined the Chinese Communists led by Mao Zedong. The Lebanese-American doctor George Hatem, who had come to Yan&#x27;an earlier, was instrumental in helping Bethune get started at his task of organizing medical services for the front and the region.

In China, Bethune performed emergency battlefield surgical operations on war casualties and established training for doctors, nurses, and orderlies. He did not distinguish between sides in treating casualties.

Bethune had thoughts on the manner in which medicine was practised, and stated:
In the summer of 1939 Bethune was appointed medical advisor to the Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei) Border Region Military District, under the direction of General Nie Rongzhen.

Stationed with the Communist Party of China&#x27;s Eighth Route Army in the midst of the Japanese invasion of China during the WWII, Bethune cut his left middle finger on October 29, 1939, while retrieving bony fragments from a soldier with a wounded leg. Three days later on November 1, while operating on another soldier with neck erysipelas, his finger wound reopened and was infected. Probably due to malnourishment, which gave him a weakened state, he contracted septicaemia and died on November 12, 1939.

There is considerable controversy surrounding the last will which Bethune purportedly wrote on the eve of his death. Here follows one version:
Dear Commander Nie,Today I feel really unwell. Probably I have to say farewell to you forever! Please send a letter to Tim Buck the General Secretary of the Canadian Communist Party. The address is No.10, Wellington Street, Toronto, Canada. Please also make a copy for Committee on International Aid to China and Democratic Alliance of Canada, tell them, I am very happy here ... Please give my Kodak Retina II camera to comrade Sha Fei.— Norman Bethune, 04:20pm, November 11th, 1939.

== Legacy ==
===In Canada===

In 1973, following the visit of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to China, the Government of Canada purchased the manse of Presbyterian Church in Gravenhurst, in which Bethune was born. The previous year, Dr. Bethune had been declared a Person of National Historic Significance. In 1976, the restored building was opened to the public as Bethune Memorial House. In 2012, the Government of Canada opened a new visitor centre, to enhance the experience of visitors to the site. The house is operated as a National Historic Site of Canada by Parks Canada.

In 1979, Dr. Norman Bethune Collegiate Institute was founded in Scarborough.

In 1998, Bethune was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame located in London, Ontario. In 2000, the University of Toronto inaugurated the annual Bethune Round Table on International Surgery, an annual surgical conference named in his honour.
In August 2000, then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, who is of Chinese descent, visited Gravenhurst and unveiled a bronze statue of him erected by the town. It stands in front of the Opera House on the town&#x27;s main street, Muskoka Road.

The city of Montreal, Quebec, has created a public square and erected a statue of him in his honour, located near the Guy-Concordia Metro station. His archives are held at McGill University in the Osler Library of the History of Medicine.
In March 1990, to commemorate the centenary of his birth, Canada and China each issued two postage stamps of the same design in his honour.

Banners with a stylized photo of him titled Local Heroes, hang in the River District of Owen Sound with his birthdate and death and listing his accomplishments as &quot;Surgeon, Inventor, Political Activist, Artist, Writer, Poet&quot;.

===In China===
Virtually unknown in his homeland during his lifetime, Bethune received international recognition when Chairman Mao Zedong of the People&#x27;s Republic of China published his eulogy entitled &quot;In Memory of Norman Bethune&quot; (), which documented the final months of the doctor&#x27;s life in China. Almost the entire Chinese population knew about the essay, which became required reading in China&#x27;s elementary schools in the 1960s. The standard elementary school text book still has the essay today: 

During the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and national defense industry in China&#x27;s interior, the eulogy was frequently assigned for Third Front workers to read. 

Bethune is one of the few Westerners to whom China has dedicated statues, of which many have been erected in his honour throughout the country. He is buried in the Revolutionary Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China, where his tomb and memorial hall lie opposite the tomb of Dwarkanath Kotnis, an Indian doctor also honoured for his humanitarian efforts in China.

Elsewhere in China, the Norman Bethune University of Medical Sciences () in Changchun, Jilin province, was one of the eleven national medical universities directly subordinated to Ministry of Health of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The predecessor of this university was the Hygiene School of of the Eighth Route Army (八路军晋察冀军区卫生学校 in Chinese) founded in 1939 by Bethune&#x27;s advocacy. The school developed with Bethune Hygiene School (February 16, 1940), Bethune Medical School (Jan 1946), Bethune Medical University (June 1946), (1948), (1951 in Tianjin), moved to Changchun in 1954, Medical College of Changchun (July 1958), Medical University of Jilin (June 1959), Norman Bethune University of Medical Sciences (March 1978), merged into Jilin University as in 2000. There are at least three dedicated statues of Bethune in this university: in the west square of College of Basic Medicine, in the Second Affiliated Hospital and in the Third Affiliated Hospital.

He is also commemorated at three institutions in Shijiazhuang – Bethune Military Medical College, Bethune Specialized Medical College and Bethune International Peace Hospital. In Canada, Norman Bethune College at York University, and Dr. Norman Bethune Collegiate Institute (a secondary school) in Scarborough, Ontario, are named after him.

The biannually awarded (), established in 1991, is the highest medical honour in China, bestowed to up to seven individuals by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Personnel of China, to recognize outstanding contribution, heroic spirit and great humanitarianism in the medical field.

The 2007 Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival featured as its central theme a memorial to Bethune.

Bethune is among the &quot;foreign friends of China&quot; that Xi Jinping cites in his foreign policy discourses in an effort to recognize the contributions of other countries to China&#x27;s national liberation.

===In Spain===
On February 7, 2006, the city of Málaga, Spain, opened the Walk of Canadians in his memory. This avenue, which runs parallel to the beach &quot;Crow Rock&quot; direction to Almeria, paid tribute to the solidarity action of Dr. Norman Bethune and his colleagues who helped the population of Málaga during the Spanish Civil War. During the ceremony, a commemorative plaque was unveiled with the inscription: &quot;Walk of Canadians – In memory of aid from the people of Canada at the hands of Norman Bethune, provided to the refugees of Málaga in February 1937&quot;. The ceremony also included a planting of an olive tree and a maple tree representative of Spain and Canada as a symbol of friendship.

=== In film and literature ===
&quot;Doctor Bethune&quot; (), was made in 1964; Gerald Tannebaum, an American humanitarian, played Bethune.

Bethune was the subject of a 1964 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Bethune,&quot; directed by Donald Brittain. The film includes interviews with many people close to Bethune, including his biographer Ted Allan.

Donald Sutherland played Bethune in the 1974–75 television show &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot; hosted by Patrick Watson.

Sutherland&#x27;s portrayal of Bethune in &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot; probably led to him securing the role of Bethune in two biographical films: &quot;Bethune&quot; (1977), made for television on a low budget, and &quot;&quot; (1990). The latter, based on a 1952 book &quot;The Scalpel, The Sword; The Story Of Doctor Norman Bethune&quot; by Ted Allan and Sydney Gordon, was a co-production of Telefilm Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, FR3 TV France and China Film Co-production.

In the CBC&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; program in 2004, he was voted the 26th Greatest Canadian by viewers.

In 2006, China Central Television produced a 20-part drama series, &quot;Norman Bethune&quot; (诺尔曼·白求恩), documenting his life, which with a budget of yuan 30 million (US$3.75 million) was the most expensive Chinese TV series to date. The series is directed by Yang Yang and starred Canadian actor Trevor Hayes.

The 2006 novel &quot;The Communist&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; by Dennis Bock, is a fictionalized account of Bethune&#x27;s life.

Adrienne Clarkson, a Chinese-Canadian and former Governor General, wrote a biography of Bethune and tells his story in the companion documentary &#x27;Adrienne Clarkson on Norman Bethune.

The Bethune biographer, Roderick Stewart, has produced five books on Norman Bethune, including &quot;Bethune&quot; (1973), &quot;The Canadians: Norman Bethune&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Mind of Norman Bethune&quot; (1990). In 2011, he co-authored with Sharon Stewart, &quot;Phoenix: The Life of Norman Bethune&quot;, a book which Canadian author Michael Bliss, in his review in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, said, &quot;should become the definitive basis for all serious discussion of Bethune&quot;. In 2014 &quot;Bethune in Spain&quot;, written by Stewart and co-author Jesus Majada, was published by Oberon Press.

The television miniseries &quot;&quot;, by CBC Television, briefly mentioned Bethune&#x27;s story during the episode describing Canadians in the Spanish Civil War.

When the CBC decided to produce a film version of Rod Langley&#x27;s 1973 play &quot;Bethune&quot;, they offered the leading role to Donald Sutherland. After accepting, Sutherland persuaded the CBC to allow Thomas Rickman to rework the Langley script. Rickman&#x27;s script, based on Roderick Stewart&#x27;s 1973 biography &quot;Bethune&quot;, was used in &quot;Bethune&quot;, the 1977 CBC film production.

The character Jerome Martell in Hugh MacLennan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot; is generally thought to have been inspired by Bethune, a claim MacLennan denied, though they were known to one another and MacLennan based much of his writing off his own life experiences. Canadian rock group The Tragically Hip wrote their 1992 hit Courage (for Hugh MacLennan) in tribute to the author and in reference to &quot;The Watch&quot; in particular. The song&#x27;s refrain &#x27;Courage, it couldn&#x27;t have come at a worse time&#x27; is a reference to the novel&#x27;s climax, in which the &#x27;Bethunian&#x27; qualities of Jerome Martell are at their peak.

&quot;The Secret History of the Intrepids&quot;, by D. K. Latta, is an alternate-history fantasy story imagining Norman Bethune, William Stephenson, Grey Owl and others as 1940s superheroes. It was published in the 2013 anthology, &quot;Masked Mosaic: Canadian Super Stories&quot;.

In the science fiction novel &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; by Cixin Liu, a foreigner named Mike Evans is given the nickname &quot;Bethune&quot; by the inhabitants of a remote area in northwestern China.

Norman Bethune is a character in the novel &quot;Los pacientes del doctor García&quot; by Almudena Grandes, where he teaches the titular character his blood transfusion techniques in a besieged Madrid during the Spanish Civil War.

<text>Dame Dorothy Tutin (8 April 19306 August 2001) was an English actress of stage, film and television. For her work in the theatre, she won two Olivier Awards and two &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Awards for Best Actress. She was made a CBE in 1967 and a Dame (DBE) in 2000.

Tutin began her stage career in 1949 and won the 1960 Best Actress &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Having made her Broadway debut in the 1963 production of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, she received a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1968 original Broadway production of &quot;Portrait of a Queen&quot;. In the 1970s, she won a second Best Actress &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award and won the Olivier Award (then the Society of London awards) for Best Actress in a Revival for &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; and &quot;The Double Dealer&quot;. Her films included &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952), &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1953), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1958), &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Shooting Party&quot; (1985).

An obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described her as &quot;one of the most enchanting, accomplished and intelligent leading ladies on the post-war British stage. With her husky voice, deep brown eyes, wistful smile and sense of humour, she brought an enduring charm to all kinds of stage drama, ancient and modern, as well as to films and television plays in a career that spanned more than 40 years&quot;.

==Biography==
Dorothy Tutin was born in London on 8 April 1930, the daughter of John Tutin and Adie Evelyn Fryers, a Yorkshire couple who married the following year.

She was educated at St Catherine&#x27;s School, Bramley, Surrey and studied for the stage at PARADA and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Tutin was also a talented pianist.

In 1963 she married the actor Derek Waring, and they had two children, Nicholas (born 1966) and Amanda, both of whom became actors (mother and daughter appeared together in the 1989 &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; episode &quot;Mending Fences&quot;). Dorothy Tutin and Derek Waring remained married until her death in 2001 at the age of 71 from leukaemia. Waring died in 2007, also from cancer.

<text>William Butterfield (7 September 1814 – 23 February 1900) was a British Gothic Revival architect and associated with the Oxford Movement (or Tractarian Movement). He is noted for his use of polychromy.

==Biography==
William Butterfield was born in London in 1814. His parents were strict non-conformists who ran a chemist&#x27;s shop in the Strand. He was one of nine children and was educated at a local school. At the age of 16, he was apprenticed to Thomas Arber, a builder in Pimlico, who later became bankrupt. He studied architecture under E. L. Blackburne (1833–1836). From 1838 to 1839, he was an assistant to Harvey Eginton, an architect in Worcester, where he became articled. He established his own architectural practice at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1840.

From 1842 Butterfield was involved with the Cambridge Camden Society, later The Ecclesiological Society. He contributed designs to the Society&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Ecclesiologist&quot;. His involvement influenced his architectural style. He also drew religious inspiration from the Oxford Movement and as such, he was very high church despite his non-conformist upbringing. He was a Gothic revival architect, and as such he reinterpreted the original Gothic style in Victorian terms. Many of his buildings were for religious use, although he also designed for colleges and schools.

Butterfield&#x27;s church of All Saints, Margaret Street, London, was, in the view of Henry-Russell Hitchcock, the building that initiated the High Victorian Gothic era. It was designed in 1850, completed externally by 1853 and consecrated in 1859. Flanked by a clergy house and school, it was intended as a &quot;model&quot; church by its sponsors, the Ecclesiological Society. The church was built of red-brick, a material long out of use in London, patterned with bands of black brick, the first use of polychrome brick in the city, with bands of stone on the spire. The interior was even more richly decorated, with marble and tile marquetry.

In 1849, just before Butterfield designed the church, John Ruskin had published his &quot;Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot;, in which he had urged the study of Italian Gothic and the use of polychromy. Many contemporaries perceived All Saints&#x27; as Italian in character, though in fact it combines fourteenth century English details, with a German-style spire.

Also in 1850 he designed, without polychromy, St Matthias&#x27; in Stoke Newington, with a bold gable-roofed tower. At St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Yealmpton in the same year, Butterfield used a considerable amount of marquetry work for the interior, and built striped piers, using two colours of marble.
At Oxford, Butterfield designed Keble College, in a style radically divergent from the university&#x27;s existing traditions of Gothic architecture, its walls boldly striped with various colours of brick. Intended for clerical students, it was largely built in 1868–70, on a fairly domestic scale, with a more monumental chapel of 1873–6. In his buildings of 1868–72 at Rugby School, the polychromy is even more brash.

Butterfield received the RIBA Gold Medal in 1884. He died in London in 1900, and was buried in a simple Gothic tomb (designed by himself) in Tottenham Cemetery, Haringey, North London. The grave can be easily seen from the public path through the cemetery, close to the gate from Tottenham Churchyard. There is a blue plaque on his house in Bedford Square, London.

<text>The Broads (known for marketing purposes as The Broads National Park) is a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes in the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Although the terms &quot;Norfolk Broads&quot; and &quot;Suffolk Broads&quot; are correctly used to identify specific areas within the two counties respectively, the whole area is frequently referred to as the Norfolk Broads.

The lakes, known as broads, were formed by the flooding of peat workings. The Broads, and some surrounding land, were constituted as a special area with a level of protection similar to a national park by the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988. The Broads Authority, a special statutory authority responsible for managing the area, became operational in 1989.

The area is , most of which is in Norfolk, with over of navigable waterways. There are seven rivers and 63 broads, mostly less than deep. Thirteen broads are generally open to navigation, with a further three having navigable channels. Some broads have navigation restrictions imposed on them in autumn and winter, although the legality of the restrictions is questionable.

The Broads has similar status to the national parks in England and Wales; the Broads Authority has powers and duties akin to the National Parks but is also the third-largest inland navigation authority. Because of its navigation role the Broads Authority was established under its own legislation, Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 which came into effect on 1 April 1989. The Broads Authority Act 2009, which was promoted through Parliament by the authority, is intended to improve public safety on the water.

==&quot;Broads National Park&quot; name==
In January 2015 the Broads Authority approved a change in name of the area to the &quot;Broads National Park&quot;, to recognise that the status of the area is equivalent to the English National Parks, that the Broads Authority shares the same two first purposes (relating to conservation and promoting enjoyment) as the English National Park Authorities, and receives a National Park grant.

This followed a three-month consultation which resulted in support from 79% of consultees, including unanimous support from the 14 UK national parks and the Campaign for National Parks. Defra, the Government department responsible for the parks, also expressed it was content that the Authority would make its own decision on the matter.

This is the subject of ongoing controversy among some Broads users who note that the Broads is not named in law as a National Park and claim the branding detracts from the Broads Authority&#x27;s third purpose which is to protect the interests of navigation. In response to this, the Broads Authority has stated that its three purposes will remain in equal balance and that the branding is simply for marketing the National Park qualities of the Broads.

==Management==
The Broads Authority is the agency which has statutory responsibility for the Broads. The Nature Conservancy Council (now Natural England), pressed for a special authority to manage the Broads which had been neglected for a long time, and in 1978 the forerunner to the present-day Broads Authority was established by the Countryside Commission (now also Natural England). Ten years later it had become clear that a statutory body was needed, and a special Act of Parliament, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (referred to as &quot;the Broads Act&quot;) made the Broads Authority into a special statutory authority which gave it parity with national park authorities but with special responsibilities for navigation. The Broads Authority Act 2009 introduced greater safety controls on the broads and rivers.

The Broads Authority has to:

* conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Broads
* promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Broads by the public
* protect the interests of navigation (as navigation authority)
* have regard for agriculture and forestry
* have regard for the economic and social interests of those who live or work in the Broads.

The authority has 21 members, who are appointed. Ten members are chosen by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, two are selected by the authority from its navigation committee, and nine are chosen by the local authorities within which the Broads lie from their own membership. Norfolk County Council appoints two members, and one member is appointed by Suffolk County Council and the district councils of Broadland, Great Yarmouth, North Norfolk, the City of Norwich, South Norfolk, and Waveney. The Broads Authority was formerly represented by one member on the East of England Regional Assembly, now defunct.

==History==

For many years the lakes known as broads were regarded as natural features of the landscape. It was only in the 1960s that Joyce Lambert proved that they were artificial features—flooded medieval peat excavations. In the Middle Ages the local monasteries began to excavate the peatlands as a turbary business, selling fuel to Norwich and Great Yarmouth. Norwich Cathedral took 320,000 tonnes of peat a year. Then the sea levels began to rise, and the pits began to flood. Despite the construction of windpumps and dykes, the flooding continued and resulted in the typical Broads landscape of today, with its reedbeds, grazing marshes and wet woodland.

Various attempts were made to extend the navigable rivers. The longest-lasting was on the River Waveney, where the Rivers Brandon and Waveney Navigation Act 1670 authorised improvements which included three locks, at Geldeston, Ellingham and Wainford. The head of navigation became a new staithe at Bungay. The new section was a private navigation which was not controlled by the Yarmouth Haven and Pier Commissioners, who had responsibility for the rest of the Broadland rivers. It remained in use until 1934 and, although the upper two locks have been replaced by sluices and Geldeston lock is derelict, the Environment Agency have negotiated with local landowners to allow use by canoes and unpowered vessels which can be portaged around the locks.

The next attempt was to extend navigation on the River Bure from Coltishall to Aylsham, which was authorised by an act of Parliament on 7 April 1773. Five locks were built, to bypass mills, at Coltishall, Oxnead Lamas, Oxnead, Burgh and Aylsham. There were financial difficulties during construction, but the works were eventually completed and opened in October 1779. At Aylsham, a cut was made from the river to a terminal basin, where several warehouses were constructed. Despite the arrival of the railways in 1879, goods continued to be carried to Aylsham by wherries until 1912, when major flooding badly damaged the locks. Unable to fund repairs, the Commissioners closed the section above Coltishall, although it was not formally abandoned until 1928. All of the locks are derelict, but the course can still be used by canoes and light craft, which can be portaged around the locks.

The third attempt was to make the River Ant navigable from Dilham to Antingham. The North Walsham and Dilham Canal Navigation Act 1812 authorised the North Walsham and Dilham Canal, but work on its construction did not start until April 1825. The canal was a true canal, as its route did not use the bed of the river, and its construction, including six locks, was completed in 1826. It was about long, and the locks raised the level by . In 1886 the canal was sold to miller, Edward Press, for £600, but the principal clerk absconded with most of the money and it was never recovered. In 1893 the section from Swafield locks to Antingham was abandoned, and the lower section was damaged by flooding in 1912. Some attempts were made to improve it in the 1920s, but the last commercial traffic used it in 1934, and it gradually became derelict after that. There is still a public right of navigation to Swafield, and there is a campaign to reopen it.

In 1814 the merchants of Norwich first suggested a plan to improve the route between Norwich and the North Sea, as the shallowness of Breydon Water created difficulties for trading vessels, and there was organised theft of cargo during its transhipment at Great Yarmouth, for which 18 men were convicted of taking the goods and one of receiving it in 1820. The initial plan was to dredge a deeper channel along the southern edge of Breydon Water, but the scheme was opposed by the people of Yarmouth. A more expensive scheme, involving the construction of a new cut to link the River Yare to the River Waveney, together with a channel between Oulton Broad and Lake Lothing, where a sea lock was needed, was also opposed by Yarmouth but formed the basis of a bill presented to Parliament. An act of Parliament, the Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation Act 1827 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. xlii), was passed on 28 May 1827, creating the Norwich and Lowestoft Navigation Company, and the work of construction and dredging of the River Yare and the Oulton Dyke was completed in 1833. The initial capital of £100,000 was inadequate and a further £50,000 was borrowed from the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission. The venture was not a commercial success and, with expenditure exceeding income, the Company was unable to repay its loan. The Haddiscoe Cut was taken over by the Commissioners in 1842 and sold to the railway developer Sir Samuel Morton Peto.

===Recreation===
The Broads have been a boating holiday destination since the late 19th century. In 1878 small yachts were available to hire from John Loynes and, with easy access to the area by rail from London, Harry Blake created an agency for yachting holidays in 1908. The first boats were owned by the boatbuilder Ernest Collins of Wroxham, but other boatyards were soon added to the business. The range of boats expanded to include powered cruisers in the 1930s, and the Hoseasons agency was founded soon after the Second World War. By the 1980s the number of cruisers available for hire was 2,400 but had decreased to around 1,700 by 2004. For conservation reasons there is a strict speed limit enforced on all vessels, to reduce waves eroding the riverbanks. These speed limits are hardwired onto most rental vessels.

The Broads have also been an important centre for racing yachts since the late 19th century, and the design of the boats have included several innovative features, including shortfin keels and a separate rudder . The design was eventually used on seagoing yachts from the 1960s.

The waterways are lock-free. There are five bridges under which only small cruisers and smaller boats can pass.

The area attracts all kinds of visitors, including ramblers, artists, anglers, and birdwatchers as well as people &quot;messing about in boats&quot;. There are a number of companies hiring boats for leisure use, including both yachts and motor launches. The Norfolk wherry, the traditional cargo craft of the area, can still be seen on the Broads as some specimens have been preserved and restored.

Ted Ellis, a local naturalist, referred to the Broads as &quot;the breathing space for the cure of souls&quot;.

A great variety of boats can be found on the Broads, from Edwardian trading wherries to state-of-the-art electric or solar-powered boats. The Broads Authority is promoting sustainable boating, and the use of electric boats is being encouraged by the provision of charging points at a number of the mooring sites provided by the Authority.

==Geography==

:See also Geology of the Broads

The Broads largely follows the line of the rivers and natural navigations of the area. There are seven navigable rivers: the River Yare and its (direct and indirect) tributaries plus the Rivers Bure, Thurne, Ant, Waveney, Chet and Wensum. There are no longer any operational locks on any of the rivers (except for Mutford Lock in Oulton Broad that links to the saltwater Lake Lothing in Lowestoft, Suffolk), and all of the waterways are subject to tidal influence. The tidal range decreases with distance from the sea, with highly tidal areas such as Breydon Water contrasting with effectively non-tidal reaches such as the River Ant upstream of Barton Broad.

The broads themselves range in size from small pools to the large expanses of Hickling Broad, Barton Broad and Breydon Water. The broads are unevenly distributed, with far more broads in the northern half of Broadland (the Rivers Bure, Thurne and Ant) than in the central and southern portions (the Rivers Yare, Waveney, Chet and Wensum). Individual broads may lie directly on the river, or are more often situated to one side and connected to the river by an artificial channel or dyke.

Besides the natural watercourses of the rivers, and the ancient but artificial broads, there is one more recent navigation canal, the lockless Haddiscoe Cut, which connects the Rivers Yare and Waveney while permitting boats to bypass Breydon Water.

There is also a second navigable link to the sea, via the River Waveney and its link to Oulton Broad. Oulton Broad is part of the Broads&#x27; tidal system, but is immediately adjacent to Lake Lothing, which acts as a harbour for Lowestoft and connects to the North Sea. Oulton Broad and Lake Lothing are connected by Mutford Lock, the only lock on the broads, and which is necessary because of the different tidal ranges and cycles in the two lakes.

The navigable section of the river is entirely urban and runs from the centre of Norwich, past Norwich Cathedral to the confluence with the Yare.

===Trinity Broads===

*Rollesby Broad
*Ormesby Broad
*Filby Broad
*Lily Broad
*Ormesby Little Broad

==Eutrophication from farming and sewage==
Eutrophication is an enormous problem in the Broads. Changes in farming practices and sewage disposal in the 1950s and 1960s released high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Broads, causing eutrophication. Algal blooms can be toxic, posing a health risk to humans and wildlife. Mass decay of plant matter removes oxygen, damaging fish stocks, preventing recreational fishing. The loss of larger plants and reed fringes in eutrophic waters increases erosion of banks and the buildup of sediment on lake floors. This impedes navigation and requires costly dredging to remove. The beauty of the area is damaged by eutrophication, which is detrimental to the tourism industry. The Broads Authority and Environment Agency have been working to return the broads to a more natural state since the problem was identified in 1965.

The first stage in reversing eutrophication in the Broads is to reduce phosphate input. Reducing nitrate input would have a similar effect, but due to the relatively higher solubility of nitrates, it is harder to control. The discharge of treated sewage was recognised as the main source of phosphates in the waters of the broads. Iron compounds have been used to precipitate phosphates out of treated sewage in all nine treatment plants upstream of Barton Broad, initially cutting phosphorus levels in sewage discharge by 90%. High levels of phosphate can remain present in the sediments at the bottom of waterways, preventing dissolved levels decreasing, even when the source is eliminated. Suction dredging has been used across the Broads to both deepen waterways and remove phosphate-rich sludge. Without stabilising the compacted peat beneath the sludge, the peat loosens and can release phosphorus at a similar rate. The growth of larger water plants, which stabilise the floor, is, therefore, necessary to complete the transformation.

Even with reduced nutrient levels, algae tend to remain dominant, blocking light and preventing plants from growing on the floor of the waterway. By manipulating the food chain, a process called biomanipulation, algae can be removed. To allow zooplankton to thrive, planktivorous fish have been largely removed from some Broads, normally by electrofishing. Around 75% of such fish must be removed for successful treatment. The explosion of zooplankton that results eats almost all algae, creating clear waters. Plants are allowed to naturally recolonise the clearer waterways. The plant growth stabilises the floor, reducing the release of phosphorus. Their own nutrient uptake reduces nutrients available to algae. Larger plants also create a favourable environment for predatory fish such as pike, which eat planktivorous fish, continuing to control their numbers. These effects tend to create a stable ecosystem where low growing underwater plants dominate.

==Ecology and conservation==
The Broads are Britain&#x27;s largest protected wetland and are home to a wealth of birdlife. Amongst the species seen are mallard, coot, moorhen, great crested grebe, greylag goose, Canada goose, Egyptian goose, grey heron, marsh harrier, cormorant, kestrel, sparrowhawk and bittern. The scarce Cetti&#x27;s warbler breeds in the broads and breeding common cranes are found in the area.

Among the rare insects are the Norfolk hawker, a species of dragonfly, and the Swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio machaon&quot; subsp. &quot;britannicus&quot;).

Some of the broads are surrounded by fens, i.e. reed and sedge beds. Norfolk reed from the broads has been a traditional material for thatching houses.

Specific parts of the Broads have been awarded a variety of conservation designations, for instance:

*Special Protection Area (SPA) status for an area named &#x27;Broadland&#x27; composed of 28 Sites of Special Scientific Interest
*Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) status for parts of the Halvergate Marshes
*National nature reserve (NNR) status for:
**Bure Marshes NNR
**Ant Broads &amp; Marshes NNR
**Hickling Broad NNR
**Ludham - Potter Heigham NNR
**Redgrave and Lopham Fen
**Martham Broad NNR
**Calthorpe Broad NNR
**Mid-Yare NNR

A specific project being considered under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan is the re-introduction of the large copper butterfly, whose habitat has been reduced by reduction of fens.

<text>Bristol Parkway, on the South Wales Main Line, serves the villages of Stoke Gifford and Harry Stoke in South Gloucestershire, England. Despite its name, it is located in Gloucestershire rather than Bristol itself, and is the busiest station in the county. It is from London Paddington. The station was opened in 1972 by British Rail and rebuilt in 2001. It is the third-most heavily used station in the West of England combined authority area, after Bristol Temple Meads and . There are four platforms, and a well-equipped waiting area. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who provide most of the trains at the station, with CrossCountry providing the rest.

Electrification using 25 kV 50 Hz AC overhead system reached Bristol Parkway in late 2018, and electric trains in the Swindon and London direction commenced passenger service on 30 December 2018. This was part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.

== Description ==
Bristol Parkway is located in the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire, in the Stoke Gifford area of the Bristol conurbation. The immediate surrounding area is mostly residential, with farmland to the south east. The main road access is from the west, with the station situated close to the M4, M5 and M32 motorways – the latter being the Bristol &quot;Parkway&quot; from which the station takes its name – as well as the A4174 Avon Ring Road. The station is on the South Wales Main Line from London to Swansea, from the eastern terminus at London Paddington. It is also on the Cross Country Route from to .

Just to the west of the station is Stoke Gifford Junction, where the Henbury Loop Line to Avonmouth Docks and Cross Country Route to Temple Meads diverge from the line to South Wales. Stoke Gifford train maintenance depot is within the junction&#x27;s confines. To the east is a Network Rail maintenance training centre. The next station north along the Cross Country Route is , the next station south is . The next station east along the South Wales Main Line is , and the next station west is , although only two trains per day call at both Bristol Parkway and Patchway.

The station is on an east–west alignment, with the main station building and car park to the north of the line. There are six lines through the station, of which the inner four have platforms, the outer two being goods loops. There is a goods yard adjacent to the station to the south. The station has four platforms, numbered 1 to 4 from south to north. Platforms 1 and 2 share an island to the south of the two central lines; platform 1 is on the south side of the island and serves southbound trains towards Bristol Temple Meads. Platform 2 is on the north side of the island and serves westbound trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. Platforms 3 and 4 share an island to the north of the two central running lines. Platform 3 serves mainly inter-city trains towards London and , while platform 4 is usually reserved for local services. An enclosed footbridge provides access to the platforms, approximately a third of the way along platforms 2 and 3 (from west to east), and at the west end of platforms 1 and 4. Platforms 2 and 3 are opposite each other, while platforms 1 and 4 are offset from platform 3, starting at the footbridge and extending further to the east. All platforms are long. Platforms 1, 3 and 4 are signalled for bidirectional running, while platform 2 is unidirectional. The footbridge can be accessed by both stairs and lifts.

The station building, a metal construction with a curved roof, opened in 2001. It contains a booking office, waiting rooms, payphones, cash machines, shops, toilets and a café overlooking the tracks. There are waiting rooms on each platform, as well as vending machines and LED displays giving next train information. Ticket barriers are in use at the station. The pay-and-display car park, run by APCOA, has 1,810 spaces.

Bristol Parkway was among the first of a new generation of park and ride railway stations, and many passengers use it for that purpose. Over the decade 2002–2012, the number of passengers starting or ending a journey at Bristol Parkway grew by 1 million passengers per year to 2.25 million, with a further 740,000 passengers changing trains there, giving an annual footfall of just under 3 million passengers and making it the 216th busiest station in the country and the third busiest in the West of England (after Bristol Temple Meads and ) . In the 2006/07 financial year, over 100,000 passengers used Parkway to travel to or from Bristol Temple Meads, and a further 500,000 used it to travel to or from London Paddington.

The line through Bristol Parkway has a linespeed of on platforms 2 and 3 ( westbound on platform 3), and on platform 4. The loading gauge is W8, and the line handles over 20 million train tonnes per year. The lines through the station were electrified in late 2018 as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.

== Services ==
===Rail===

The station is managed by Great Western Railway, who operate most rail services from the station. Their weekday service consists of two trains per hour each way between and (one extended to ), one service each way between and via , and one train per hour between and Temple Meads (one train every two hours extended to and ).

CrossCountry also operate trains from Bristol Parkway. Their weekday service consists of one hourly train each way between Bristol Temple Meads and , and one hourly train each way between , Bristol and Edinburgh Waverley via and Newcastle. Both these services run via .

Great Western Railway services between London and South Wales are formed of Class 800 or Class 802 bi-mode multiple units, while other GWR services are formed using Class 43 locomotives with British Rail Mark 3 &quot;Castle Class&quot; sets, Class 158, 165 and 166 diesel multiple-unit trains. CrossCountry services are formed of and Voyager diesel-electric multiple units.

The standard journey time to London Paddington is 90 minutes, to Cardiff Central 40 minutes, to Birmingham New Street 75 minutes, and to Bristol Temple Meads 12 minutes.

In December 2022, the ORR gave approval to the open access company Grand Union to commence a service from Paddington to Carmarthen in partnership with Spanish rail operator Renfe, for which a fleet of new bi-mode trains will be used. The new service is scheduled to commence in December 2024. The service will call at Bristol Parkway, Severn Tunnel Junction, Newport, Cardiff Central, Gowerton and Llanelli en-route to Carmarthen, and will provide Bristol Parkway with regular non-stop trains to London.



===Bus===
Bristol Parkway is served by bus routes linking it with the rest of Bristol and South Gloucestershire, including Avonmouth, Severn Beach, Cribbs Causeway, Bath, Temple Meads, Southmead Hospital, Chipping Sodbury and Yate. These routes are operated by First West of England and Stagecoach West. Metrobus route m4 started on 22 January 2023, connecting Cribbs Causeway via Parkway to Bristol.

== History ==


The line through Bristol Parkway was opened in 1903 as part of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;Badminton Line&quot; from Wootton Bassett to , a short-cut for trains from London to South Wales, avoiding Bath and . The station was built on the site of the Stoke Gifford marshalling yard, which closed on 4 October 1971, having become surplus to requirements with the cessation of wagonload freight trains. The station&#x27;s development was seen as a response to the potential growth of housing and commercial developments in north Bristol, with proximity to the M4 and M5 motorway interchange at Almondsbury also important. The name &quot;Parkway&quot; came from proximity to the M32 motorway, known as the Bristol Parkway, although the term Parkway has since been applied to park and ride stations throughout the United Kingdom. When the station was built it was outside the developed urban area, but the growth of housing and commercial development in adjoining areas of the North Fringe has brought it within the conurbation, with many large office complexes opened nearby.

The station, owned by British Rail, opened on 1 May 1972. Services were operated by the Western Region until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the InterCity and Regional Railways divisions. The original structures, built by Stone &amp; Co. of Bristol, were basic – two island platforms connected by an open metal footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the current platform 3), on the north side of the tracks, was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. The platforms were long. The station opened with a 600-space car park and a fastest journey to London of 95 minutes, which was subsequently reduced to 75 minutes with the introduction of the new High Speed Trains in 1976. Platform canopies were added in 1973, along with a cover for the footbridge. Further minor improvements were implemented over the next thirty years, including a new booking office and extensions to the car park.

Following the privatisation of British Rail in 1997, services at Bristol Parkway were franchised to several train operating companies. South Wales Main Line services were provided by Great Western Trains, which was later rebranded as First Great Western; services from Bristol to Birmingham and the north were operated by Virgin CrossCountry; and local services were franchised to Wales &amp; West, which was succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and awarded to First Great Western, which became known as Great Western Railway in 2016. Virgin CrossCountry services were taken over by Arriva CrossCountry in 2007.

In the August 1998, Royal Mail began construction of a mail terminal to the east of the station, taking over some of the station car park to provide a platform and warehouse for postal trains. The building opened on 15 May 2000, replacing a similar facility at Bristol Temple Meads, with the Royal Mail stating it would save of lorry journeys per year on local roads. However, the depot closed only four years later in 2004, when Royal Mail ceased to use the rail network. Royal Mail offered the terminal for use by freight companies, but as there were no takers it was demolished in October 2007. In 2008, Network Rail opened a maintenance training centre on the site in a £2.5 million project which saw the construction of a mezzanine floor, a welding workshop and a extension.

In 2000, work began on a complete redevelopment of the station building with a new enclosed footbridge. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers&#x27; journeys to and from the station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new long platform face on the north side of platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3million and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.

Despite the large car park, the increase in passenger numbers at Parkway led to problems with on-street parking, leading to the commissioning of a new 200-space car park east of the station. It opened in Spring 2011, but was used by only 139 motorists in its first three months; it was expected that traffic would increase when a new bus link was opened to transfer drivers from the car park to the station. A new multi-storey car park on the station site with 710 spaces was opened on 5 September 2014 by Baroness Kramer, Minister of State for Transport. Construction of the car park, which began in mid-2013, caused a short-term lack of spaces for commuters. The car park cost £13 million and was funded jointly by Network Rail and the Department for Transport under the Station Commercial Projects Fund. Improved cycle facilities, including a bike hire scheme, were provided in the late 2000s.

The station was closed for two weeks in September 2017 to allow for upgrade work as part of the electrification and upgrade work for the Great Western route. Works included resignalling, installation of overhead electrification gantries, and the start of construction of a new fourth platform on the south side of platform 2. The new platform 1 took over an existing goods loop, allowing trains towards Bristol and towards Wales to be accommodated at the same time, thus easing a bottleneck. It was opened on 13 April 2018 by Chris Grayling MP, Secretary of State for Transport. The other platforms were lengthened to at the same time. The station closed for three weeks in Autumn 2018 for further electrification works, including the installation and testing of overhead wires.

First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The CrossCountry franchise was due to expire in October 2019, but it was announced in September 2020 that the emergency timetables introduced to meet COVID-19 requirements would continue for a further 18 months and the letting of new franchises would be scrapped. , the New CrossCountry franchise is let to Arriva-owned CrossCountry until 2027 and the Greater Western franchise to FirstGroup-owned Great Western Railway until 2028.

== Future ==

The South Wales Main Line from London to Cardiff has been electrified. However, the lines to Weston-super-Mare and the Cross Country Route to Birmingham New Street, the West Midlands, the East Midlands and Northern England will not be electrified, so local and CrossCountry services will still be provided by diesel trains. In 2011, the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supported the electrification continuing to Weston, as did the Member of Parliament for Weston-super-Mare, John Penrose.

Bristol Parkway is on the Weston-super-Mare/ corridor, one of the main axes of MetroWest, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. Under its previous name of Greater Bristol Metro, 2012 plans considered the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line to passengers, with the possibility of services from Bristol Temple Meads to Bristol Parkway via and . The current MetroWest Phase 2 proposals are for a spur to Henbury, served by trains from , without a direct connection to Parkway.

<text>A flywheel is a mechanical device that uses the conservation of angular momentum to store rotational energy, a form of kinetic energy proportional to the product of its moment of inertia and the square of its rotational speed. In particular, assuming the flywheel&#x27;s moment of inertia is constant (i.e., a flywheel with fixed mass and second moment of area revolving about some fixed axis) then the stored (rotational) energy is directly associated with the square of its rotational speed.

Since a flywheel serves to store mechanical energy for later use, it is natural to consider it as a kinetic energy analogue of an electrical capacitor. Once suitably abstracted, this shared principle of energy storage is described in the generalized concept of an accumulator. As with other types of accumulators, a flywheel inherently smooths sufficiently small deviations in the power output of a system, thereby effectively playing the role of a low-pass filter with respect to the mechanical velocity (angular, or otherwise) of the system. More precisely, a flywheel&#x27;s stored energy will donate a surge in power output upon a drop in power input and will conversely absorb any excess power input (system-generated power) in the form of rotational energy.

Common uses of a flywheel include smoothing a power output in reciprocating engines, flywheel energy storage, delivering energy at higher rates than the source, and controlling the orientation of a mechanical system using gyroscope and reaction wheel. Flywheels are typically made of steel and rotate on conventional bearings; these are generally limited to a maximum revolution rate of a few thousand RPM. High energy density flywheels can be made of carbon fiber composites and employ magnetic bearings, enabling them to revolve at speeds up to 60,000 RPM (1 kHz).

== History ==
The principle of the flywheel is found in the Neolithic spindle and the potter&#x27;s wheel, as well as circular sharpening stones in antiquity. In the early 11th century, Ibn Bassal pioneered the use of flywheel in noria and saqiyah. The use of the flywheel as a general mechanical device to equalize the speed of rotation is, according to the American medievalist Lynn White, recorded in the &quot;De diversibus artibus&quot; (On various arts) of the German artisan Theophilus Presbyter (ca. 1070–1125) who records applying the device in several of his machines.

In the Industrial Revolution, James Watt contributed to the development of the flywheel in the steam engine, and his contemporary James Pickard used a flywheel combined with a crank to transform reciprocating motion into rotary motion.

== Physics ==
The kinetic energy (or more specifically rotational energy) stored by the flywheel&#x27;s can be calculated by formula_1. ω is the angular velocity, and formula_2 is the moment of inertia of the flywheel about its axis of symmetry. The moment of inertia is a measure of resistance to torque applied on a spinning object (i.e. the higher the moment of inertia, the slower it will accelerate when a given torque is applied). The moment of inertia can be calculated for cylindrical shapes using mass (formula_3) and radius (formula_4). For a solid cylinder it is formula_5, for a thin-walled empty cylinder it is approximately formula_6, and for a thick-walled empty cylinder with constant density it is formula_7.

For a given flywheel design, the kinetic energy is proportional to the ratio of the hoop stress to the material density and to the mass. The specific tensile strength of a flywheel can be defined as formula_8. The flywheel material with the highest specific tensile strength will yield the highest energy storage per unit mass. This is one reason why carbon fiber is a material of interest. For a given design the stored energy is proportional to the hoop stress and the volume.

An electric motor-powered flywheel is common in practice. The output power of the electric motor is approximately equal to the output power of the flywheel. It can be calculated by formula_9, where formula_10 is the voltage of rotor winding, formula_11 is stator voltage, and formula_12 is the angle between two voltages. Increasing amounts of rotation energy can be stored in the flywheel until the rotor shatters. This happens when the hoop stress within the rotor exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of the rotor material. Tensile stress can be calculated by formula_13, where formula_14 is the density of the cylinder, formula_15 is the radius of the cylinder, and formula_16 is the angular velocity of the cylinder.

== Design ==

A rimmed flywheel has a rim, a hub, and spokes. Calculation of the flywheel&#x27;s moment of inertia can be more easily analysed by applying various simplifications. One method is to assume the spokes, shaft and hub have zero moments of inertia, and the flywheel&#x27;s moment of inertia is from the rim alone. Another is to lump moments of inertia of spokes, hub and shaft into the rim. These may be estimated as a percentage of the flywheel&#x27;s moment of inertia, with the majority from the rim, so that formula_17. For example, if the moments of inertia of hub, spokes and shaft are deemed negligible, and the rim&#x27;s thickness is very small compared to its mean radius (formula_18), the radius of rotation of the rim is equal to its mean radius and thus formula_19.

A shaftless flywheel eliminates the annulus holes, shaft or hub. It has higher energy density than conventional design but requires a specialized magnetic bearing and control system. The specific energy of a flywheel is determined byformula_20, in which formula_21 is the shape factor, formula_22 the material&#x27;s tensile strength and formula_23 the density. While a typical flywheel has a shape factor of 0.3, the shaftless flywheel has a shape factor close to 0.6, out of a theoretical limit of about 1.

A superflywheel consists of a solid core (hub) and multiple thin layers of high-strength flexible materials (such as special steels, carbon fiber composites, glass fiber, or graphene) wound around it. Compared to conventional flywheels, superflywheels can store more energy and are safer to operate. In case of failure, a superflywheel does not explode or burst into large shards like a regular flywheel, but instead splits into layers. The separated layers then slow a superflywheel down by sliding against the inner walls of the enclosure, thus preventing any further destruction. Although the exact value of energy density of a superflywheel would depend on the material used, it could theoretically be as high as 1200 Wh (4.4 MJ) per kg of mass for graphene superflywheels. The first superflywheel was patented in 1964 by the Soviet-Russian scientist Nurbei Guilia.

== Materials ==

Flywheels are made from many different materials; the application determines the choice of material. Small flywheels made of lead are found in children&#x27;s toys. Cast iron flywheels are used in old steam engines. Flywheels used in car engines are made of cast or nodular iron, steel or aluminum. Flywheels made from high-strength steel or composites have been proposed for use in vehicle energy storage and braking systems.

The efficiency of a flywheel is determined by the maximum amount of energy it can store per unit weight. As the flywheel&#x27;s rotational speed or angular velocity is increased, the stored energy increases; however, the stresses also increase. If the hoop stress surpass the tensile strength of the material, the flywheel will break apart. Thus, the tensile strength limits the amount of energy that a flywheel can store.

In this context, using lead for a flywheel in a child&#x27;s toy is not efficient; however, the flywheel velocity never approaches its burst velocity because the limit in this case is the pulling-power of the child. In other applications, such as an automobile, the flywheel operates at a specified angular velocity and is constrained by the space it must fit in, so the goal is to maximize the stored energy per unit volume. The material selection therefore depends on the application.

== Applications ==
Flywheels are often used to provide continuous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous. For example, a flywheel is used to smooth the fast angular velocity fluctuations of the crankshaft in a reciprocating engine. In this case, a crankshaft flywheel stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing piston and then returns that energy to the piston to compress a fresh charge of air and fuel. Another example is the friction motor which powers devices such as toy cars. In unstressed and inexpensive cases, to save on cost, the bulk of the mass of the flywheel is toward the rim of the wheel. Pushing the mass away from the axis of rotation heightens rotational inertia for a given total mass.

A flywheel may also be used to supply intermittent pulses of energy at power levels that exceed the abilities of its energy source. This is achieved by accumulating energy in the flywheel over a period of time, at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time when it is needed. For example, flywheels are used in power hammers and riveting machines.

Flywheels can be used to control direction and oppose unwanted motions. Flywheels in this context have a wide range of applications: gyroscopes for instrumentation, ship stability, satellite stabilization (reaction wheel), keeping a toy spin spinning (friction motor), stabilizing magnetically-levitated objects (spin-stabilized magnetic levitation).

Flywheels may also be used as an electric compensator, like a synchronous compensator, that can either produce or sink reactive power but would not affect the real power. The purposes for that application are to improve the power factor of the system or adjust the grid voltage. Typically, the flywheels used in this field are similar in structure and installation as the synchronous motor (but it is called synchronous compensator or synchronous condenser in this context). There are also some other kinds of compensator using flywheels, like the single phase induction machine. But the basic ideas here are the same, the flywheels are controlled to spin exactly at the frequency which you want to compensate. For a synchronous compensator, the voltage of rotor and stator also must be kept in phase, which is the same as keeping the magnetic field of rotor and the total magnetic field in phase (in the rotating frame reference).

<text>Interstate 81 (I-81) is a north–south (physically northeast–southwest) Interstate Highway in the eastern part of the United States. Its southern terminus is at I-40 in Dandridge, Tennessee; its northern terminus is on Wellesley Island, New York at the Canadian border, where the Thousand Islands Bridge connects it to Highway 137 and ultimately to Highway 401, the main Ontario freeway connecting Detroit via Toronto to Montreal. The major metropolitan areas along the route of I-81 include the Tri-Cities of Tennessee; Roanoke in Virginia; Hagerstown in Maryland; Harrisburg and the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania; and Binghamton and Syracuse in New York.

I-81 largely traces the paths created down the length of the Appalachian Mountains through the Great Appalachian Valley by migrating animals, indigenous peoples, and early settlers. It also follows a major corridor for troop movements during the Civil War. These trails and roadways gradually evolved into US Route 11 (US 11); I-81 parallels much of the older US 11. Being mostly rural in nature, I-81 is heavily used as a trucking corridor and is often used as a bypass of busier and more congested Interstates to the east such as I-95; for this reason, it is also used heavily by drug and human traffickers, as it is less monitored by law enforcement than I-95. This led to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) forming a taskforce to combat the issue in 2017.

The I-81 Corridor Coalition, a six-state coalition, was organized to handle issues along I-81, such as truck traffic and air pollution; the commission meets annually. I-81 is part of the fastest route between the capital of the US (Washington, D.C.) and the capital of Canada (Ottawa) and Mexico (Mexico City).

== Route description ==
I-81 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

=== Tennessee ===

I-81 begins in Tennessee at I-40 in Dandridge, a route that connects to Knoxville to the west and Asheville to the east. I-81 meets I-26 and US 23, which go to Kingsport and Johnson City. At milemarker 75, I-81 leaves Tennessee and enters Virginia.

=== Virginia ===
I-81 in Virginia is largely a rural route with brief concurrencies with I-77 and I-64. The route parallels the Appalachian Mountains for much of its route through Tennessee and Virginia, serving such cities as the twin cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia; Wytheville; Roanoke; Christiansburg; Lexington; Staunton; Harrisonburg; and Winchester. In Harrisonburg, I-81 cuts through James Madison University. It parallels its older counterpart, US 11, for its entire length in Virginia.

=== West Virginia ===
I-81 briefly enters the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia for about , serving the city of Martinsburg. The entire routing is in Berkeley County and serves the Eastern WV Regional Airport. The West Virginia segment was completed in 1966 and there have been no realignments since.

=== Maryland ===
In Maryland, the Interstate Highway runs from the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Williamsport north to the Pennsylvania state line near Maugansville. I-81 is the primary north–south Interstate Highway in Washington County, connecting Hagerstown with Chambersburg and Harrisburg to the north and Martinsburg, Winchester, and Roanoke to the south. It is the shortest mainline Interstate in Maryland and contains the shortest portion of I-81 of all six states through which the Interstate highway passes. The Interstate was dedicated as Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987. I-81 passes through the state of Maryland at one of its narrowest points, the &quot;Hub City&quot; of Hagerstown where it intersects with a large number of other routes, most notably I-70. Hagerstown Regional Airport is served by this Interstate Highway.

=== Pennsylvania ===
I-81 forms a major north–south corridor through the state of Pennsylvania, serving the boroughs of Chambersburg and Carlisle, where it meets the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) but does not directly interchange with it (motorists must use US 11 to connect). Around the state capital of Harrisburg, the route forms the northern section of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Capital Beltway. The route then travels northeast toward the Wyoming Valley, where it serves the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, then heads north through the Endless Mountains region toward the state line.

=== New York ===
In New York, I-81 crosses the Pennsylvania state line southeast of Binghamton. The freeway runs north–south through Central New York, serving the cities of Binghamton, Syracuse, and Watertown. It passes through the Thousand Islands in its final miles and crosses two bridges, both part of the series of bridges known as the Thousand Islands Bridge. South of Watertown, I-81 closely parallels US 11, the main north–south highway in Central New York prior to the construction of I-81. At Watertown, US 11 turns northeastward to head across New York&#x27;s North Country while I-81 continues on a generally northward track to the Canadian border. From there, the road continues into the province of Ontario as Highway 137, a short route leading north to the nearby Highway 401.

== History ==

I-81 roughly parallels the Great Indian Warpath, an old Indian trail that connected New York to the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States via Virginia and West Virginia. A series of roads linking Virginia to Maryland through Martinsburg were present on maps as early as 1873. New York was originally served by New York State Route 2 (NY 2), a road built in 1924; NY 2 was replaced by US 11 in 1927. A highway that largely followed the path of US 11 was built and became known as the Penn-Can Highway. On August 14, 1957, the highway was redesigned as I-81. In New York, the first segments of what would become I-81 were begun in 1954. In Maryland, the Interstate was begun with the Hagerstown Bypass in the mid-1950s. After several bouts of expansion, the freeway was completed from US 40 (now Maryland Route 144 [MD 144]) to the Pennsylvania state line in 1958 and marked as I-81 in 1959. Bidding on contracts in West Virginia opened in July 1958. In Virginia, the first Interstate hearing was held in February 1957. At the end of 1957, construction began on a stretch near Buchanan, Virginia. A section of the Interstate opened in 1959. A stretch in Harrisonburg was opened as well. By late 1963, in Virginia were open.

The first statewide segment to be completed was that of West Virginia, which was finished in 1966. The section opened on October 19, 1966. In western Maryland, various parts of I-81 were built in the early 1960s, and the remainder of the highway south to the Potomac River was under construction by 1965 and opened in 1966. Since then, I-81 in Maryland has remained largely unchanged. In Tennessee by 1965, of the of Interstate Highways were completed. Construction was expected to be finished in 1969, but a large portion of the work would not be completed until 1974, and most of the road was open by December 1974. The final major segment of the Interstate in the north to be built was a section in New York, opened in October 1968. That same year, work in Pennsylvania was completed. The road would not be completely built in Tennessee until August 1975. Construction on parts in Virginia dragged on until it was finished in July 1987. The segment in New York cost $270 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build.

== Auxiliary routes ==
I-81 has six related, auxiliary Interstate Highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-381 runs , connecting Bristol, Virginia, to I-81. I-581 is a spur that connects Roanoke, Virginia, to I-81. It is proposed to be overtaken by I-73. Pennsylvania Route 581 (PA 581) connects Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to I-81. It runs . I-481 serves as an eastern bypass of Syracuse, New York. NY 481 is a northwestern extension of I-481 that ends in Oswego. I-781 extends for , that connects Fort Drum, New York, to the Interstate. NY 281 is a north–south state highway in Central New York in the US that extends for across Cortland and Onondaga counties, roughly paralleling I-81 and connecting at both ends.

I-181 was a offshoot of I-81, linking to Kingsport, Tennessee. It was decommissioned in August 2005 when I-26 took over I-181&#x27;s entire length. I-281 was replaced in January 1970 by I-481. I-81E was replaced by the current I-380.

<doc id="89484" wikidata="Q2457049" url="?curid=89484" title="Reaction wheel">
<text>A reaction wheel (RW) is an electric motor attached to a flywheel, which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes a counter-rotation proportionately through conservation of angular momentum. A reaction wheel can rotate only around its center of mass; it is not capable of moving from one place to another (translational force).

Reaction wheels are used primarily by spacecraft for three-axis attitude control, and do not require rockets or external applicators of torque, which reduces the mass fraction needed for fuel. They provide a high pointing accuracy, and are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star.

A reaction wheel is sometimes operated at a constant (or near-constant) rotation speed, to provide a satellite with a large amount of stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft&#x27;s rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel&#x27;s spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion (precession) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this &quot;momentum-bias&quot; stabilization approach include SCISAT-1; by orienting the momentum wheel&#x27;s axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a &quot;pitch momentum bias&quot; configuration.

== Design ==

For three-axis control, reaction wheels must be mounted along at least three directions, with extra wheels providing redundancy to the attitude control system. A redundant mounting configuration could consist of four wheels along tetrahedral axes, or a spare wheel carried in addition to a three axis configuration. Changes in speed (in either direction) are controlled electronically by computer. The strength of the materials used in a reaction wheel determine the speed at which the wheel would come apart, and therefore how much angular momentum it can store.

Since the reaction wheel is a small fraction of the spacecraft&#x27;s total mass, easily controlled, temporary changes in its speed result in small changes in angle. The wheels therefore permit very precise changes in a spacecraft&#x27;s attitude. For this reason, reaction wheels are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes.

Over time, reaction wheels may build up enough stored momentum to exceed the maximum speed of the wheel, called saturation. However, slowing down the wheels imparts a torque causing undesired rotation. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms to cancel out the torque caused by &quot;desaturating&quot; the reaction wheels. Typically designers use &quot;reaction control systems&quot;; arrays of small chemical rocket engines that fire as the wheels slow down to counter the torque the wheels are imparting on the spacecraft as they slow down.

More fuel efficient methods for reaction wheel desaturation have been developed over time. By reducing the amount of fuel the spacecraft needs to be launched with, they increase the useful payload that can be delivered to orbit. These methods include magnetorquers (better known as torque rods), which transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field requiring only electrical power and no fuel. They are however limited to areas of space with a sufficiently large magnetic field (such as in low Earth orbit). In the absence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the next most efficient practice is to use high-efficiency attitude jets such as ion thrusters.

== Examples ==

Beresheet was launched on a Falcon 9 rocket on 22 February 2019 1:45 UTC, with the goal of landing on the Moon. Beresheet uses the low-energy transfer technique to save fuel. Since its fourth maneuver in its elliptical orbit, to prevent shakes when the amount of liquid fuel ran low, there was a need to use a reaction wheel.

The James Webb Space Telescope has six reaction wheels built by Rockwell Collins Deutschland.

LightSail 2 was launched on 25 June 2019, focused around the concept of a solar sail. LightSail 2 uses a reaction wheel system to change orientation by very small amounts, allowing it to receive different amounts of momentum from the light across the sail, resulting in a higher altitude.

== Failures and mission impact ==

The failure of one or more reaction wheels can cause a spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain attitude (orientation) and thus potentially cause a mission failure. Recent studies conclude that these failures can be correlated with space weather effects. These events probably caused failures by inducing electrostatic discharge in the steel ball bearings of Ithaco wheels, compromising the smoothness of the mechanism.

Two servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope have replaced a reaction wheel. In February 1997, the Second Servicing Mission (STS-82) replaced one after &#x27;electrical anomalies&#x27;, rather than any mechanical problem. Study of the returned mechanism provided a rare opportunity to study equipment that had undergone long-term service (seven years) in space, particularly for the effects of vacuum on lubricants. The lubricating compound was found to be in &#x27;excellent condition&#x27;. In 2002, during Servicing Mission 3B (STS-109), astronauts from the shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; replaced another reaction wheel. Neither of these wheels had failed and Hubble was designed with four redundant wheels, and maintained pointing ability so long as three were functional.

In 2004, during the mission of the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; spacecraft, an X-axis reaction wheel failed. The Y-axis wheel failed in 2005, causing the craft to rely on chemical thrusters to maintain attitude control.

From July 2012 to May 11, 2013, two out of the four reaction wheels in the Kepler space telescope failed. This loss severely affected Kepler ability to maintain a sufficiently precise orientation to continue its original mission. On August 15, 2013, engineers concluded that Kepler&#x27;s reaction wheels cannot be recovered and that planet-searching using the transit method (measuring changes in star brightness caused by orbiting planets) could not continue. Although the failed reaction wheels still function, they are experiencing friction exceeding acceptable levels, and consequently hindering the ability of the telescope to properly orient itself. The Kepler telescope was returned to its &quot;point rest state&quot;, a stable configuration that uses small amounts of thruster fuel to compensate for the failed reaction wheels, while the Kepler team considered alternative uses for Kepler that do not require the extreme accuracy in its orientation needed by the original mission. On May 16, 2014, NASA extended the Kepler mission to a new mission named K2, which uses Kepler differently, but allows it to continue searching for exoplanets. On October 30, 2018, NASA announced the end of the Kepler mission after it was determined that the fuel supply had been exhausted.

The NASA space probe &quot;Dawn&quot; had excess friction in one reaction wheel in June 2010. It was originally scheduled to depart Vesta and begin its two-and-a-half-year journey to Ceres on August 26, 2012; however, a problem with another of the spacecraft&#x27;s reaction wheels forced &quot;Dawn&quot; to briefly delay its departure from Vesta&#x27;s gravity until September 5, 2012, and it planned to use thruster jets instead of the reaction wheels during the three-year journey to Ceres. The loss of the reaction wheels limited the camera observations on the approach to Ceres.

On the evening of Tuesday, January 18, 2022, a possible failure of one of the Swift Observatory&#x27;s reaction wheels caused the mission control team to power off the suspected wheel, putting the observatory in safe mode as a precaution. This was the first time a reaction wheel failed on Swift in 17 years. Swift resumed science operations on February 17, 2022.

== Similar devices ==

A control moment gyroscope (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis gimbal. When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft&#x27;s pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger or more-agile (or both) spacecraft, including Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station.

<doc id="89486" wikidata="Q165309" url="?curid=89486" title="Inequation">
<text>In mathematics, an inequation is a statement that an inequality holds between two values. It is usually written in the form of a pair of expressions denoting the values in question, with a relational sign between them indicating the specific inequality relation. Some examples of inequations are:

* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3
* formula_4

In some cases, the term &quot;inequation&quot; can be considered synonymous to the term &quot;inequality&quot;, while in other cases, an inequation is reserved only for statements whose inequality relation is &quot;not equal to&quot; (≠).

==Chains of inequations==
A shorthand notation is used for the conjunction of several inequations involving common expressions, by chaining them together. For example, the chain
:formula_5
is shorthand for
:formula_6
which also implies that formula_7 and formula_8.

In rare cases, chains without such implications about distant terms are used.
For example formula_9 is shorthand for formula_10, which does not imply formula_11 Similarly, formula_12 is shorthand for formula_13, which does not imply any order of formula_14 and formula_15.

==Solving inequations==
Similar to equation solving, &quot;inequation solving&quot; means finding what values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) fulfill a condition stated in the form of an inequation or a conjunction of several inequations. These expressions contain one or more &quot;unknowns&quot;, which are free variables for which values are sought that cause the condition to be fulfilled. To be precise, what is sought are often not necessarily actual values, but, more in general, expressions. A &quot;solution&quot; of the inequation is an assignment of expressions to the &quot;unknowns&quot; that satisfies the inequation(s); in other words, expressions such that, when they are substituted for the unknowns, make the inequations true propositions.
Often, an additional &quot;objective&quot; expression (i.e., an optimization equation) is given, that is to be minimized or maximized by an &quot;optimal&quot; solution.

For example,

:formula_16

is a conjunction of inequations, partly written as chains (where formula_17 can be read as &quot;and&quot;); the set of its solutions is shown in blue in the picture (the red, green, and orange line corresponding to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd conjunct, respectively). For a larger example. see Linear programming#Example.

Computer support in solving inequations is described in constraint programming; in particular, the simplex algorithm finds optimal solutions of linear inequations. The programming language Prolog III also supports solving algorithms for particular classes of inequalities (and other relations) as a basic language feature. For more, see constraint logic programming.

== Combinations of meanings ==
Usually because of the properties of certain functions (like square roots), some inequations are equivalent to a combination of multiple others. For example, the inequation formula_18 is logically equivalent to the following three inequations combined:

# formula_19
# formula_20
# formula_21

<text>East Carolina University (ECU) is a public university in Greenville, North Carolina, United States. It is the fourth largest university in North Carolina and the only one in the state with schools of medicine, dentistry and engineering.

Founded on March 8, 1907, as a teacher training school, East Carolina has grown from its original to almost today. The university&#x27;s academic facilities are located on six properties: Main Campus; Health Sciences Campus; West Research Campus; the Field Station for Coastal Studies in New Holland, North Carolina; the Millennial Research Innovation Campus in Greenville&#x27;s warehouse district; and an overseas campus in Certaldo Alto, Italy. ECU also operates the Coastal Studies Institute.

The research university has nine undergraduate colleges, graduate school, and four professional schools. All of the non-health sciences majors are located on the main campus. The College of Nursing, College of Allied Health Sciences, The Brody School of Medicine, and School of Dental Medicine are located on the health science campus. ECU is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity&quot;.

There are 11 social sororities, 16 social fraternities, four historically black sororities, five historically black fraternities, one Native American fraternity, and one Native American sorority. There are over 400 registered clubs on campus including fraternities and sororities.

==History==
On March 8, 1907, East Carolina Teachers Training School (ECTTS) was officially chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly through the passing of legislation Public Laws of North Carolina, 1907, Chapter 820 titled &quot;An Act to Stimulate High School Instruction in the Public Schools of the State and Teacher Training&quot;. The chairman of its original Board of Trustees, Thomas Jordan Jarvis, a former Governor of North Carolina now known as the &quot;Father of ECU&quot;, participated in groundbreaking ceremonies for the first buildings on July 2, 1908, in Greenville, North Carolina, and ECTTS opened its doors on October 5, 1909. Although its purpose was to train &quot;young white men and women&quot;, there were no male graduates until 1932. In 1920, ECTTS became a four–year institution and renamed East Carolina Teachers College; its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded the following year in education. A master&#x27;s degree program was authorized in 1929; the first such degree granted by the college was in 1933. Progress toward full college status was made in 1948 with the designation of the Bachelor of Arts as a liberal arts degree, and the Bachelor of Science as a teaching degree. A change of name to East Carolina College in 1951 reflected this expanded mission. Over the objections of Governor Dan K. Moore, who opposed the creation of a university system separate from the Consolidated University of North Carolina, ECC was made a regional university effective July 1, 1967, and assumed its present name, East Carolina University. The university did not remain independent for long; on July 1, 1972, it was incorporated into the University of North Carolina System, the successor to the Consolidated University. Today, ECU is the fourth–largest university in North Carolina with  undergraduate and  graduate students, including the 344 medicine and 206 dental students.

==Campus==
East Carolina is separated into three distinct campuses: Main Campus, Health Sciences Campus, and West Research Campus. It owns two sports complexes: Blount Recreational Sports Complex and North Recreational Complex. It owns a field station in New Holland, North Carolina.

===Main===
The main campus, also known as the east campus, is about in an urban residential area of downtown Greenville. The 158 buildings on main campus comprise more than of academic, research, and residential space. Many of the Main Campus buildings feature the Spanish–Mission style architecture; inspiration drawn from Thomas Jarvis&#x27; time as an ambassador to Brazil. He wanted to bring the unique architecture to eastern North Carolina. On the main campus, there are five districts: Campus Core, Downtown District, Warehouse District, Athletic fields and the South Academic District. On the Campus Core, there are 15 residence halls which are divided into three separate neighborhoods. The distinct feature of the main campus is the mall, which is a large tree–laden grassy area where many students go to relax. In the middle of the mall is the replica of the cupola on the original Austin building.

====Athletic fields====
The varsity athletics fields are located south of the College Hill residential neighborhood. Fourteenth Street divides College Hill to the north, with the athletic fields to the south. Charles Boulevard borders the fields to the west and Greenville Boulevard borders it to the south. A residential neighborhood and Elmhurst Elementary School are the eastern borders. The northern portion of the area sits Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, Minges Coliseum, and Minges Natatorium, along with parking. The Murphy Center, which is the primary strength and conditioning, and banquet building, is located between Dowdy-Ficklen and Minges Coliseum. The Ward Sports Medicine Building, Scales Field House, and the Pirate Club Building also surround Dowdy-Ficklen. The Ward Sports Medicine Building houses offices for football, Pirate Club, and athletic administration. The Scales Field House provides locker rooms, additional athletic department offices for marketing and event operations, and classroom space for ECU&#x27;s athletic training program. South of those facilities is the Cliff Moore Practice Facility which has a pair of natural grass fields and one FieldTurf field designed exclusively for the football team. On the southern border of the practice facility is Clark-LeClair Stadium, which is the men&#x27;s baseball stadium. It opened in 2005 and seats 3,000 in permanent seating with another 2,000 located in the outfield. At the southern end of the fields is the Olympic Sports Complex, which include women&#x27;s soccer stadium, softball stadium, track and field facility, and Olympic Sports Team building. The Olympic Sports Complex was completed in 2011 with a price of $23.4 million. The Smith-Williams Center is a $17 million basketball development and practice facility, opened in 2013. The football stadium is planning for a $40 million upgrade. The upgrades will include a new press, club, and suite areas, and upper deck, all located on the south side. This addition will increase the capacity from 50,000 to 60,000.

East Carolina has spent $92 million on athletic projects from 1998 to 2011. Including the proposed projects, this is increased to $145 million.

===Health Sciences===
The Health Sciences campus prepares health care practitioners across a full range of professions, including nurses, dentists, physical therapists, speech therapists, physicians, and more. Many graduates of ECU health sciences remain in the underserved East Carolina region to provide care in the area. It is situated beside ECU Health Medical Center. ECU Health Medical Center was originally Pitt County Memorial Hospital and Vidant Medical Center (VMC). After becoming a private non-profit hospital, the renaming occurred. ECU Health Medical Center, an 861–bed flagship Level I Trauma Center, serves as the academic medical center for The Brody School of Medicine. ECU Health owns ECU Health Medical Center, leases or owns six and manages one. The area is about west of Main Campus on with nearly of academic and research space in 62 buildings. Other buildings besides VMC include Brody Medicine Science Building, the East Carolina Heart Institute, Leo Jenkins Cancer Center, and the Allied Health building composed of the College of Nursing, Laupus Medical Library and College of Allied Health Sciences. The Family Medicine Center opened in the fall of 2011. Ross Hall, which houses the School of Dental Medicine, is just under 200,000 square feet.

===West Research===
West Research Campus lies on approximately west of the Health Sciences Campus. It consists of four buildings with on the former Voice of America site. Approximately are designated wetlands and large areas of biology, botany and other sciences field study sites. It has an environmental health onsite wastewater demonstration facility which is open to the public and all educators. It is also the home of the North Carolina Institute for Health and Safety in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries with an administrative and several support buildings.

<text>In mathematics, an inequality is a relation which makes a non-equal comparison between two numbers or other mathematical expressions. It is used most often to compare two numbers on the number line by their size. The main types of inequality are less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;).

==Notation==
There are several different notations used to represent different kinds of inequalities:
* The notation &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is less than &quot;b&quot;.
* The notation &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is greater than &quot;b&quot;.
In either case, &quot;a&quot; is not equal to &quot;b&quot;. These relations are known as strict inequalities, meaning that &quot;a&quot; is strictly less than or strictly greater than &quot;b&quot;. Equality is excluded.

In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict:
* The notation &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; ⩽ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; ≦ &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is less than or equal to &quot;b&quot; (or, equivalently, at most &quot;b&quot;, or not greater than &quot;b&quot;).
* The notation &quot;a&quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; ⩾ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;a&quot; ≧ &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is greater than or equal to &quot;b&quot; (or, equivalently, at least &quot;b&quot;, or not less than &quot;b&quot;).

In the 17th and 18th centuries, personal notations or typewriting signs were used to signal inequalities. For example, In 1670, John Wallis used a single horizontal bar &quot;above&quot; rather than below the &lt; and &gt;.
Later in 1734, ≦ and ≧, known as &quot;less than (greater-than) over equal to&quot; or &quot;less than (greater than) or equal to with double horizontal bars&quot;, first appeared in Pierre Bouguer&#x27;s work . After that, mathematicians simplified Bouguer&#x27;s symbol to &quot;less than (greater than) or equal to with one horizontal bar&quot; (≤), or &quot;less than (greater than) or slanted equal to&quot; (⩽).

The relation not greater than can also be represented by formula_1 the symbol for &quot;greater than&quot; bisected by a slash, &quot;not&quot;. The same is true for not less than, formula_2

The notation &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is not equal to &quot;b&quot;; this &quot;inequation&quot; sometimes is considered a form of strict inequality. It does not say that one is greater than the other; it does not even require &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; to be member of an ordered set.

In engineering sciences, less formal use of the notation is to state that one quantity is &quot;much greater&quot; than another, normally by several orders of magnitude. 
* The notation &quot;a&quot; ≪ &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is much less than &quot;b&quot;.
* The notation &quot;a&quot; ≫ &quot;b&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; is much greater than &quot;b&quot;.
This implies that the lesser value can be neglected with little effect on the accuracy of an approximation (such as the case of ultrarelativistic limit in physics).

In all of the cases above, any two symbols mirroring each other are symmetrical; &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot; are equivalent, etc.

== Properties on the number line ==
Inequalities are governed by the following properties. All of these properties also hold if all of the non-strict inequalities (≤ and ≥) are replaced by their corresponding strict inequalities (&lt; and &gt;) and — in the case of applying a function — monotonic functions are limited to &quot;strictly&quot; monotonic functions.

=== Converse ===
The relations ≤ and ≥ are each other&#x27;s converse, meaning that for any real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;:
===Transitivity===

The transitive property of inequality states that for any real numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;:

If &quot;either&quot; of the premises is a strict inequality, then the conclusion is a strict inequality:

===Addition and subtraction===

A common constant &quot;c&quot; may be added to or subtracted from both sides of an inequality. So, for any real numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;:
In other words, the inequality relation is preserved under addition (or subtraction) and the real numbers are an ordered group under addition.

===Multiplication and division===
The properties that deal with multiplication and division state that for any real numbers, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and non-zero &quot;c&quot;:

In other words, the inequality relation is preserved under multiplication and division with positive constant, but is reversed when a negative constant is involved. More generally, this applies for an ordered field. For more information, see &quot;§ Ordered fields&quot;.

===Additive inverse===

The property for the additive inverse states that for any real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;:
===Multiplicative inverse===

If both numbers are positive, then the inequality relation between the multiplicative inverses is opposite of that between the original numbers. More specifically, for any non-zero real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; that are both positive (or both negative):
All of the cases for the signs of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can also be written in chained notation, as follows:

===Applying a function to both sides===

Any monotonically increasing function, by its definition, may be applied to both sides of an inequality without breaking the inequality relation (provided that both expressions are in the domain of that function). However, applying a monotonically decreasing function to both sides of an inequality means the inequality relation would be reversed. The rules for the additive inverse, and the multiplicative inverse for positive numbers, are both examples of applying a monotonically decreasing function.

If the inequality is strict (&quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;) &quot;and&quot; the function is strictly monotonic, then the inequality remains strict. If only one of these conditions is strict, then the resultant inequality is non-strict. In fact, the rules for additive and multiplicative inverses are both examples of applying a &quot;strictly&quot; monotonically decreasing function.

A few examples of this rule are: 
* Raising both sides of an inequality to a power &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 (equiv., −&quot;n&quot; &lt; 0), when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive real numbers: 
* Taking the natural logarithm on both sides of an inequality, when &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive real numbers: (this is true because the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function.)

== Formal definitions and generalizations ==

A (non-strict) partial order is a binary relation ≤ over a set &quot;P&quot; which is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. That is, for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, it must satisfy the three following clauses:

* &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; (reflexivity)
* if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; (antisymmetry)
* if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; (transitivity)

A set with a partial order is called a partially ordered set. Those are the very basic axioms that every kind of order has to satisfy. 

A strict partial order is a relation &lt; that satisfies 
* &quot;a&quot; ≮ &quot;a&quot; (irreflexivity),
* if &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;b&quot; ≮ &quot;a&quot; (asymmetry),
* if &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; (transitivity),
where means that does not hold.

Some types of partial orders are specified by adding further axioms, such as:

* Total order: For every &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; or &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; .
* Dense order: For all &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;P&quot; for which &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, there is a &quot;c&quot; in &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;.
* Least-upper-bound property: Every non-empty subset of &quot;P&quot; with an upper bound has a &quot;least&quot; upper bound (supremum) in &quot;P&quot;.

=== Ordered fields ===

If (&quot;F&quot;, +, ×) is a field and ≤ is a total order on &quot;F&quot;, then (&quot;F&quot;, +, ×, ≤) is called an ordered field if and only if:
* &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies &quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;;
* 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot; and 0 ≤ &quot;b&quot; implies 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot;.

Both and are ordered fields, but cannot be defined in order to make an ordered field, because −1 is the square of &quot;i&quot; and would therefore be positive.

Besides being an ordered field, R also has the Least-upper-bound property. In fact, R can be defined as the only ordered field with that quality.

== Chained notation ==

The notation a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c stands for &quot;&quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot;&quot;, from which, by the transitivity property above, it also follows that &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot;. By the above laws, one can add or subtract the same number to all three terms, or multiply or divide all three terms by same nonzero number and reverse all inequalities if that number is negative. Hence, for example, &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; + &quot;e&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; is equivalent to &quot;a&quot; − &quot;e&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; − &quot;e&quot;.

This notation can be generalized to any number of terms: for instance, &quot;a&quot;1 ≤ &quot;a&quot;2 ≤ ... ≤ &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; means that &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot; − 1. By transitivity, this condition is equivalent to &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; for any 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.

When solving inequalities using chained notation, it is possible and sometimes necessary to evaluate the terms independently. For instance, to solve the inequality 4&quot;x&quot; &lt; 2&quot;x&quot; + 1 ≤ 3&quot;x&quot; + 2, it is not possible to isolate &quot;x&quot; in any one part of the inequality through addition or subtraction. Instead, the inequalities must be solved independently, yielding &quot;x&quot; &lt; and &quot;x&quot; ≥ −1 respectively, which can be combined into the final solution −1 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; .

Occasionally, chained notation is used with inequalities in different directions, in which case the meaning is the logical conjunction of the inequalities between adjacent terms. For example, the defining condition of a zigzag poset is written as &quot;a&quot;1 &lt; &quot;a&quot;2 &gt; &quot;a&quot;3 &lt; &quot;a&quot;4 &gt; &quot;a&quot;5 &lt; &quot;a&quot;6 &gt; ... . Mixed chained notation is used more often with compatible relations, like &lt;, =, ≤. For instance, &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot; means that &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot;. This notation exists in a few programming languages such as Python. In contrast, in programming languages that provide an ordering on the type of comparison results, such as C, even homogeneous chains may have a completely different meaning.

The cylindrical algebraic decomposition is an algorithm that allows testing whether a system of polynomial equations and inequalities has solutions, and, if solutions exist, describing them. The complexity of this algorithm is doubly exponential in the number of variables. It is an active research domain to design algorithms that are more efficient in specific cases.
