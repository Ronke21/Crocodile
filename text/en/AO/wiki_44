<text>Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 192016 April 1958) was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer. Her work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, Franklin&#x27;s contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognised during her life, for which Franklin has been variously referred to as the &quot;wronged heroine&quot;, the &quot;dark lady of DNA&quot;, the &quot;forgotten heroine&quot;, a &quot;feminist icon&quot;, and the &quot;Sylvia Plath of molecular biology&quot;.

Franklin graduated in 1941 with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College, Cambridge, and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. Disappointed by Norrish&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm, she took up a research position under the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942. The research on coal helped Franklin earn a PhD from Cambridge in 1945. Moving to Paris in 1947 as a (postdoctoral researcher) under Jacques Mering at the &quot;Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l&#x27;État&quot;, she became an accomplished X-ray crystallographer. After joining King&#x27;s College London in 1951 as a research associate, Franklin discovered some key properties of DNA, which eventually facilitated the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA. Owing to disagreement with her director, John Randall, and her colleague Maurice Wilkins, Franklin was compelled to move to Birkbeck College in 1953.

Franklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA while at King&#x27;s College London, particularly Photo 51, taken by her student Raymond Gosling, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. While Gosling actually took the famous Photo 51, Maurice Wilkins showed it to James Watson without her permission.

Watson suggested that Franklin would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Wilkins but it was not possible because the pre-1974 rule dictated that a Nobel prize could not be awarded posthumously unless the nomination had been made for a then-alive candidate before 1 February of the award year and Franklin died a few years before 1962 when the discovery of the structure of DNA was recognised by the Nobel committee.

Working under John Desmond Bernal, Franklin led pioneering work at Birkbeck on the molecular structures of viruses. On the day before she was to unveil the structure of tobacco mosaic virus at an international fair in Brussels, Franklin died of ovarian cancer at the age of 37 in 1958. Her team member Aaron Klug continued her research, winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1982.

==Early life==
Franklin was born in 50 Chepstow Villas, Notting Hill, London, into an affluent and influential British Jewish family.

===Family===
Franklin&#x27;s father, Ellis Arthur Franklin (1894–1964), was a politically liberal London merchant banker who taught at the city&#x27;s Working Men&#x27;s College, and her mother was Muriel Frances Waley (1894–1976). Rosalind was the elder daughter and the second child in the family of five children. David (1919–1986) was the eldest brother while Colin (1923–2020), Roland (1926–2024), and Jenifer (born 1929) were her younger siblings.

Franklin&#x27;s paternal great-uncle was Herbert Samuel (later Viscount Samuel), who was the Home Secretary in 1916 and the first practising Jew to serve in the British Cabinet. Her aunt, Helen Caroline Franklin, known in the family as Mamie, was married to Norman de Mattos Bentwich, who was the Attorney General in the British Mandate of Palestine. Helen was active in trade union organisation and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and was later a member of the London County Council. Franklin&#x27;s uncle, Hugh Franklin, was another prominent figure in the suffrage movement, although his actions therein embarrassed the Franklin family. Rosalind&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Elsie&quot;, was in memory of Hugh&#x27;s first wife, who died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Her family was actively involved with the Working Men&#x27;s College, where her father taught the subjects of electricity, magnetism, and the history of the Great War in the evenings, later becoming the vice principal.

Franklin&#x27;s parents helped settle Jewish refugees from Europe who had escaped the Nazis, particularly those from the &quot;Kindertransport&quot;. They took in two Jewish children to their home, and one of them, a nine-year-old Austrian, Evi Eisenstädter, shared Jenifer&#x27;s room. (Evi&#x27;s father Hans Mathias Eisenstädter had been imprisoned in Buchenwald, and after liberation, the family adopted the surname &quot;Ellis&quot;.)

===Education===
From early childhood, Franklin showed exceptional scholastic abilities. At age six, she joined her brother Roland at Norland Place School, a private day school in West London. At that time, her aunt Mamie (Helen Bentwich), described her to her husband: &quot;Rosalind is alarmingly clever – she spends all her time doing arithmetic for pleasure, and invariably gets her sums right.&quot; Franklin also developed an early interest in cricket and hockey. At age nine, she entered a boarding school, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex. The school was near the seaside, and the family wanted a good environment for Franklin&#x27;s delicate health.

Franklin was 11 when she went to St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Hammersmith, west London, one of the few girls&#x27; schools in London that taught physics and chemistry. At St Paul&#x27;s, she excelled in science, Latin, and sports. Franklin also learned German, and became fluent in French, a language she would later find useful. Franklin topped her classes, and won annual awards. Her only educational weakness was in music, for which the school music director, the composer Gustav Holst, once called upon her mother to enquire whether she might have suffered from hearing problems or tonsillitis. With six distinctions, Franklin passed her matriculation in 1938, winning a scholarship for university, the School Leaving Exhibition of £30 a year for three years, and £5 from her grandfather. Franklin&#x27;s father asked her to give the scholarship to a deserving refugee student.

===Cambridge and World War II===
Franklin went to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1938 and studied chemistry within the Natural Sciences Tripos. There, she met the spectroscopist Bill Price, who worked with her as a laboratory demonstrator and who later became one of her senior colleagues at King&#x27;s College London. In 1941 Franklin was awarded second-class honours from her final exams. The distinction was accepted as a bachelor&#x27;s degree in qualifications for employment. Cambridge began awarding titular BA and MA degrees to women from 1947 and the previous women graduates retroactively received these earned degrees. In her last year at Cambridge, Franklin met a French refugee Adrienne Weill, a former student of Marie Curie, who had a huge influence on her life and career and who helped her to improve her conversational French.

Franklin was awarded a research fellowship at Newnham College, with which she joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the University of Cambridge to work under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, who later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In her one year of work there, Franklin did not have much success. As described by his biographer, Norrish was &quot;obstinate and almost perverse in argument, overbearing and sensitive to criticism&quot;. He could not decide upon the assignment of work for her. At that time Norrish was succumbing due to heavy drinking. Franklin wrote that he made her despise him completely.

Resigning from Norrish&#x27;s Lab, Franklin fulfilled the requirements of the National Service Acts by working as an assistant research officer at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942. The BCURA was located on the Coombe Springs Estate near Kingston upon Thames near the southwestern boundary of London. Norrish acted as advisor to the military at BCURA. John G. Bennett was the director. Marcello Pirani and Victor Goldschmidt, both refugees from the Nazis, were consultants and lectured at BCURA while Franklin worked there.

During her BCURA research Franklin initially stayed at Adrienne Weill&#x27;s boarding house in Cambridge until her cousin, Irene Franklin, proposed that they share living quarters at a vacated house in Putney that belonged to her uncle. With Irene, Rosalind volunteered as an Air Raid Warden and regularly made patrols to see the welfare of people during air raids.

Franklin studied the porosity of coal using helium to determine its density. Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space. By concluding that substances were expelled in order of molecular size as temperature increased, she helped classify coals and accurately predict their performance for fuel purposes and for production of wartime devices such as gas masks. This work was the basis of Franklin&#x27;s PhD thesis &quot;The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal&quot; for which the University of Cambridge awarded her a PhD in 1945. It was also the basis of several papers.

==Career and research==
===Paris===
With World War II ending in 1945, Franklin asked Adrienne Weill for help and to let her know of job openings for &quot;a physical chemist who knows very little physical chemistry, but quite a lot about the holes in coal.&quot; At a conference in the autumn of 1946, Weill introduced Franklin to Marcel Mathieu, a director of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), the network of institutes that comprises the major part of the scientific research laboratories supported by the French government. This led to her appointment with Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l&#x27;État in Paris. Franklin joined the &quot;labo&quot; (as referred to by the staff) of Mering on 14 February 1947 as one of the fifteen &quot;chercheurs&quot; (researchers).

Mering was an X-ray crystallographer who applied X-ray diffraction to the study of rayon and other amorphous substances, in contrast to the thousands of regular crystals that had been studied by this method for many years. He taught her the practical aspects of applying X-ray crystallography to amorphous substances. This presented new challenges in the conduct of experiments and the interpretation of results. Franklin applied them to further problems related to coal and to other carbonaceous materials, in particular the changes to the arrangement of atoms when these are converted to graphite. She published several further papers on this work which has become part of the mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal and carbon. Franklin coined the terms graphitising and non-graphitising carbon. The coal work was covered in a 1993 monograph, and in the regularly-published textbook &quot;Chemistry and Physics of Carbon&quot;. Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.

===King&#x27;s College London===
In 1950 Franklin was granted a three-year Turner &amp; Newall Fellowship to work at King&#x27;s College London. In January 1951 she started working as a research associate in the Medical Research Council&#x27;s (MRC) Biophysics Unit, directed by John Randall. She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of proteins and lipids in solution, but Randall redirected Franklin&#x27;s work to DNA fibres because of new developments in the field, and she was to be the only experienced experimental diffraction researcher at King&#x27;s at the time. Randall made this reassignment, even before Franklin started working at King&#x27;s, because of the pioneering work by DNA researcher Maurice Wilkins, and he reassigned Raymond Gosling, the graduate student who had been working with Wilkins, to be her assistant.

In 1950 Swiss chemist Rudolf Signer in Berne prepared a highly purified DNA sample from calf thymus. He freely distributed the DNA sample, later referred to as the Signer DNA, in early May 1950 at the meeting of the Faraday Society in London, and Wilkins was one of the recipients. Even using crude equipment, Wilkins and Gosling had obtained a good-quality diffraction picture of the DNA sample which sparked further interest in this molecule. But Randall had not indicated to them that he had asked Franklin to take over both the DNA diffraction work and guidance of Gosling&#x27;s thesis. It was while Wilkins was away on holiday that Randall, in a letter in December 1950, assured Franklin that &quot;as far as the experimental X-ray effort there would be for the moment only yourself and Gosling.&quot; Randall&#x27;s lack of communication about this reassignment significantly contributed to the well documented friction that developed between Wilkins and Franklin. When Wilkins returned, he handed over the Signer DNA and Gosling to Franklin.

Franklin, now working with Gosling, started to apply her expertise in X-ray diffraction techniques to the structure of DNA. She used a new fine-focus X-ray tube and microcamera ordered by Wilkins, but which she refined, adjusted and focused carefully. Drawing upon her physical chemistry background, a critical innovation Franklin applied was making the camera chamber that could be controlled for its humidity using different saturated salt solutions. When Wilkins enquired about this improved technique, she replied in terms which offended him as she had &quot;an air of cool superiority&quot;.

Franklin&#x27;s habit of intensely looking people in the eye while being concise, impatient and direct unnerved many of her colleagues. In stark contrast, Wilkins was very shy, and slowly calculating in speech while he avoided looking anyone directly in the eye. With the ingenious humidity-controlling camera, Franklin was soon able to produce X-ray images of better quality than those of Wilkins. She immediately discovered that the DNA sample could exist in two forms: at a relative humidity higher than 75%, the DNA fibre became long and thin; when it was drier, it became short and fat. She originally referred to the former as &quot;wet&quot; and the latter as &quot;crystalline.&quot;

On the structure of the crystalline DNA, Franklin first recorded the analysis in her notebook, which reads: &quot;Evidence for spiral [meaning helical] structure. Straight chain untwisted is highly improbable. Absence of reflections on meridian in χtalline [crystalline] form suggests spiral structure.&quot; An immediate discovery from this was that the phosphate group lies outside of the main DNA chain; Franklin, however could not make out whether there could be two or three chains. She presented their data at a lecture in November 1951, in King&#x27;s College London. In her lecture notes, Franklin wrote the following:The results suggest a helical structure (which must be very closely packed) containing 2, 3 or 4 co-axial nucleic acid chains per helical unit, and having the phosphate groups near the outside.Franklin then named &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively for the &quot;crystalline&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; forms. (The biological functions of A-DNA were discovered only 60 years later.) Because of the intense personality conflict developing between Franklin and Wilkins, Randall divided the work on DNA. Franklin chose the data rich &quot;A&quot; form while Wilkins selected the &quot;B&quot; form. 

By the end of 1951 it became generally accepted at King&#x27;s that the B-DNA was a helix, but after Franklin had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A-DNA was a helix. In July 1952, as a practical joke on Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the &#x27;death&#x27; of helical A-DNA, which runs:It is with great regret that we have to announce the death, on Friday 18th July 1952 of DNA helix (crystalline). Death followed a protracted illness which an intensive course of Besselised [referring to Bessel function that was used to analyse the X-ray diffraction patterns] injections had failed to relieve. A memorial service will be held next Monday or Tuesday. It is hoped that Dr M H F Wilkins will speak in memory of the late helix. [Signed Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.]During 1952 they worked at applying the Patterson function to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced. This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into the structure of the molecule. Franklin was fully committed to experimental data and was sternly against theoretical or model buildings, as she said, &quot;We are not going to speculate, we are going to wait, we are going to let the spots on this photograph tell us what the [DNA] structure is.&quot; The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark &quot;Photo 51&quot; taken by Gosling at this time, have been called by John Desmond Bernal as &quot;amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken&quot;.

By January 1953 Franklin had reconciled her conflicting data, concluding that both DNA forms had two helices, and had started to write a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone (see below). Franklin&#x27;s two A-DNA manuscripts reached &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot; in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953, the day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA. Franklin must have mailed them while the Cambridge team was building their model, and certainly had written them before she knew of their work. On 8 July 1953 Franklin modified one of these &quot;in proof&quot; &quot;Acta&quot; articles, &quot;in light of recent work&quot; by the King&#x27;s and Cambridge research teams.

The third draft paper was on the B-DNA, dated 17 March 1953, which was discovered years later amongst her papers, by Franklin&#x27;s Birkbeck colleague, Aaron Klug. He then published in 1974 an evaluation of the draft&#x27;s close correlation with the third of the original trio of 25 April 1953 &quot;Nature&quot; DNA articles. Klug designed this paper to complement the first article he had written in 1968 defending Franklin&#x27;s significant contribution to DNA structure. Klug had written this first article in response to the incomplete picture of Franklin&#x27;s work depicted in James Watson&#x27;s 1968 memoir, &quot;The Double Helix&quot;.

As vividly described by Watson, he travelled to King&#x27;s on 30 January 1953 carrying a preprint of Linus Pauling&#x27;s incorrect proposal for DNA structure. Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin&#x27;s lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin&#x27;s DNA X-ray image. Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Robert Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.

====Discovery of DNA structure====
In November 1951 James Watson and Francis Crick of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a molecular model of the B-DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King&#x27;s. Based on Franklin&#x27;s lecture in November 1951 that DNA was helical with either two or three stands, they constructed a triple helix model, which was immediately proven to be flawed. In particular, the model had the phosphate backbone of the molecules forming a central core. But Franklin pointed out that the progressive solubility of DNA crystals in water meant that the strongly hydrophilic phosphate groups were likely to be on the outside of the structure; while the experimental failure to titrate the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases meant that these were more likely to be inaccessible in the interior of the structure. This initial setback led Watson and Crick to focus on other topics for most of the next year.

Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the alpha helix by Linus Pauling in 1951, but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known. Franklin&#x27;s conviction was only reinforced when Pauling and Corey also came up in the late 1952 (published in February 1953) with an erroneous triple helix model. Ever cautious, Franklin wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that Franklin routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA.

The arrival in Cambridge of Linus Pauling&#x27;s flawed paper in January 1953 prompted the head of the Cavendish Laboratory, Lawrence Bragg, to encourage Watson and Crick to resume their own model building. Six weeks of intense efforts followed, as they tried to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA structure, within the broad parameters set by the experimental data from the team at King&#x27;s, that the structure should contain one or more helices with a repeat distance of 34 Angstroms, with probably ten elements in each repeat; and that the hydrophilic phosphate groups should be on the outside (though as Watson and Crick struggled to come up with a structure they at times departed from each of these assumptions during the process).

Crick and Watson received a further impetus in the middle of February 1953 when Crick&#x27;s thesis advisor, Max Perutz, gave Crick a copy of a report written for a Medical Research Council biophysics committee visit to King&#x27;s in December 1952, containing many of Franklin&#x27;s crystallographic calculations. This decisively confirmed the 34 Angstrom repeat distance; and established that the structure had C2 symmetry, immediately confirming to Crick that it must contain an equal number of parallel and anti-parallel strands running in opposite directions.

Since Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King&#x27;s, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin&#x27;s diffraction photographs by Gosling. By 28 February 1953 Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had &quot;found the secret of life&quot;. However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain. The closeness of fit to the experimental data from King&#x27;s was an essential corroboration of the structure.

Watson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, a day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put &quot;all hands to the pump&quot;. This was also one day after Franklin&#x27;s two A-DNA papers had reached &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot;. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin&#x27;s biographer Brenda Maddox, on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King&#x27;s.

One of the most critical and overlooked moments in DNA research was how and when Franklin realised and conceded that B-DNA was a double helical molecule. When Klug first examined Franklin&#x27;s documents after her death, he initially came to an impression that Franklin was not convinced of the double helical nature until the knowledge of the Cambridge model. But Klug later discovered the original draft of the manuscript (dated 17 March 1953) from which it became clear that Franklin had already resolved the correct structure. The news of Watson–Crick model reached King&#x27;s the next day, 18 March, suggesting that Franklin would have learned of it much later since she had moved to Birkbeck. Further scrutiny of her notebook revealed that Franklin had already thought of the helical structure for B-DNA in February 1953 but was not sure of the number of strands, as she wrote: &quot;Evidence for 2-chain (or 1-chain helix).&quot; Her conclusion on the helical nature was evident, though she failed to understand the complete organisation of the DNA strands, as the possibility of two strands running in opposite directions did not occur to her.

Towards the end of February Franklin began to work out the indications of double strands, as she noted: &quot;Structure B does not fit single helical theory, even for low layer-lines.&quot; It soon dawned to her that the B-DNA and A-DNA were structurally similar, and perceived A-DNA as an &quot;unwound version&quot; of B-DNA. Franklin and Gosling wrote a five-paged manuscript on 17 March titled &quot;A Note on Molecular Configuration of Sodium Thymonucleate.&quot; After the Watson–Crick model was known, there appeared to be only one (hand-written) modification after the typeset at the end of the text which states that their data was consistent with the model, and appeared as such in the trio of 25 April 1953 &quot;Nature&quot; articles; the other modification being a deletion of &quot;A Note on&quot; from the title.

As Franklin considered the double helix, she also realised that the structure would not depend on the detailed order of the bases, and noted that &quot;an infinite variety of nucleotide sequences would be possible to explain the biological specificity of DNA&quot;. However she did not yet see the complementarity of the base-pairing – Crick and Watson&#x27;s breakthrough of 28 February, with all its biological significance; nor indeed at this point did she yet have the correct structures of the bases, so even if she had tried, she would not have been able to make a satisfactory structure. Science historians Nathaniel C. Comfort, of Johns Hopkins University, and Matthew Cobb, of the University of Manchester, explained that &quot;She did not have time to make these final leaps, because Watson and Crick beat her to the answer.&quot;

Weeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model. Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson–Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, &quot;It&#x27;s very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?&quot; As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. Accordingly, her response to the Watson–Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.

Crick and Watson published their model in &quot;Nature&quot; on 25 April 1953, in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging &quot;having been stimulated by a general knowledge of Franklin and Wilkins&#x27; &#x27;unpublished&#x27; contribution.&quot; Actually, although it was the bare minimum, they had just enough specific knowledge of Franklin and Gosling&#x27;s data upon which to base their model. As a result of a deal struck by the two laboratory directors, articles by Wilkins and Franklin, which included their X-ray diffraction data, were modified and then published second and third in the same issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, seemingly only in support of the Crick and Watson theoretical paper which proposed a model for the B-DNA. Most of the scientific community hesitated several years before accepting the double helix proposal. At first mainly geneticists embraced the model because of its obvious genetic implications.

===Birkbeck College===
Franklin left King&#x27;s College London in mid-March 1953 for Birkbeck College, in a move that had been planned for some time and that she described (in a letter to Adrienne Weill in Paris) as &quot;moving from a palace to the slums ... but pleasanter all the same&quot;. She was recruited by physics department chair John Desmond Bernal, a crystallographer who was a communist, known for promoting female crystallographers. Her new laboratories were housed in 21 Torrington Square, one of a pair of dilapidated and cramped Georgian houses containing several different departments; Franklin frequently took Bernal to task over the careless attitudes of some of the other laboratory staff, notably after workers in the pharmacy department flooded her first-floor laboratory with water on one occasion.

Despite the parting words of Bernal to stop her interest in nucleic acids, Franklin helped Gosling to finish his thesis, although she was no longer his official supervisor. Together, they published the first evidence of double helix in the A form of DNA in the 25 July issue of &quot;Nature&quot;. At the end of 1954, Bernal secured funding for Franklin from the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), which enabled her to work as a senior scientist supervising her own research group. John Finch, a physics student from King&#x27;s College London, subsequently joined Franklin&#x27;s group, followed by Kenneth Holmes, a Cambridge graduate, in July 1955. Despite the ARC funding, Franklin wrote to Bernal that the existing facilities remained highly unsuited for conducting research &quot;...my desk and lab are on the fourth floor, my X-ray tube in the basement, and I am responsible for the work of four people distributed over the basement, first and second floors on two different staircases.&quot;

====RNA research====
Franklin continued to explore another major nucleic acid, RNA, a molecule equally central to life as DNA. She again used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), an RNA virus. Her meeting with Aaron Klug in early 1954 led to a longstanding and successful collaboration. Klug had just then earned his PhD from Trinity College, Cambridge, and joined Birkbeck in late 1953. In 1955, Franklin published her first major works on TMV in &quot;Nature&quot;, where she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length. This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist Norman Pirie, though Franklin&#x27;s observation ultimately proved correct.

Franklin assigned the study of the complete structure of TMV to her PhD student Holmes. They soon discovered (published in 1956) that the covering of TMV was protein molecules arranged in helices. Her colleague Klug worked on spherical viruses with his student Finch, with Franklin coordinating and overseeing the work. As a team, from 1956 they started publishing seminal works on TMV, cucumber virus 4 and turnip yellow mosaic virus.

Franklin also had a research assistant, James Watt, subsidised by the National Coal Board and was now the leader of the ARC group at Birkbeck. The Birkbeck team members continued working on RNA viruses affecting several plants, including potato, turnip, tomato and pea. In 1955 the team was joined by an American post-doctoral student Donald Caspar. He worked on the precise location of RNA molecules in TMV. In 1956, Caspar and Franklin published individual but complementary papers in the 10 March issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, in which they showed that the RNA in TMV is wound along the inner surface of the hollow virus. Caspar was not an enthusiastic writer, and Franklin had to write the entire manuscript for him.

Franklin&#x27;s research grant from ARC expired at the end of 1957, and she was never given the full salary proposed by Birkbeck. After Bernal requested ARC chairman Lord Rothschild, she was given a one-year extension ending in March 1958.

Expo 58, the first major international fair after World War II, was to be held in Brussels in 1958. Franklin was invited to make a five-foot high model of TMV, which she started in 1957. Her materials included table tennis balls and plastic bicycle handlebar grips. The Brussels world&#x27;s fair, with an exhibit of her virus model at the International Science Pavilion, opened on 17 April, one day after she died.

====Polio virus====

In 1956 Franklin visited the University of California, Berkeley, where colleagues suggested her group research the polio virus. In 1957 she applied for a grant from the United States Public Health Service of the National Institutes of Health, which approved £10,000 (equivalent to £ in ) for three years, the largest fund ever received at Birkbeck. In her grant application, Franklin mentioned her new interest in animal virus research. She obtained Bernal&#x27;s consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after Franklin disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine during the group&#x27;s research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.

After Franklin&#x27;s death Klug succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959 Klug and Finch published the group&#x27;s findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units. The team moved to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, in 1962 and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.

==Personal life==
Franklin was best described as an agnostic. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone&#x27;s influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the existence of God, and remarked, &quot;Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn&#x27;t She?&quot; She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:
However, Franklin did not abandon Jewish traditions. As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church. She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather&#x27;s request. Franklin confided to her sister that she was &quot;always consciously a Jew&quot;.

Franklin loved travelling abroad, particularly trekking. She first &quot;qualified&quot; at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at Menton, France, where her grandfather went to escape the English winter. Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave Franklin a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as &quot;vastly superior to that of English&quot;. In contrast, Franklin described English people as having &quot;vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency&quot;. Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home. In another instance, Franklin trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. Franklin slipped off a slope, and was barely rescued. But she wrote to her mother, &quot;I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food.&quot; Of note are also Franklin&#x27;s visits to Yugoslavia. She collaborated with Slovenian chemist whom she met at King&#x27;s College in 1951. In the 1950s, she visited Slovenia one or more times where she held a lecture on coal in Ljubljana and visited the Julian Alps (Triglav and Bled). Her best-known trekking photograph was presumably created by Hadži in May 1952 and depicts Franklin against the background of the natural rock formation of Heathen Maiden. She also collaborated with the Croatian physicist Katarina Kranjc. She held lectures in Zagreb and Belgrade and visited Dalmatia.

Franklin made several professional trips to the United States, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the University of California, Los Angeles, later recalled that Franklin was the opposite of Watson&#x27;s description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her &quot;sunny side&quot;.

In his book &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays Franklin as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as &quot;Rosalind&quot;, he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as &quot;Rosy&quot;, the name people at King&#x27;s College London used behind her back. Franklin did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called &quot;Ros&quot;. To others, Franklin was simply &quot;Rosalind&quot;. She made it clear to an American visiting friend, Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick&#x27;s table in The Eagle pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she would like to be addressed, she replied &quot;I&#x27;m afraid it will have to be Rosalind&quot;, adding &quot;Most definitely not &quot;Rosy&quot;.&quot;

Franklin often expressed her political views. She initially blamed Winston Churchill for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. Franklin actively supported Professor John Ryle as an independent candidate for parliament in the 1940 Cambridge University by-election, but he was unsuccessful.

Franklin did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with Ralph Miliband but failed. Franklin once told Evi that a man who had a flat on the same floor as hers asked if she would like to come in for a drink, but she did not understand the intention. She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress. Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her &quot;intelligence and beauty&quot;. According to Anne Sayre, Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing a second surgery, but Maddox reported that the family denied this. Mering wept when he visited her later, and destroyed all her letters after her death.

Franklin&#x27;s closest personal affair was probably with her once post-doctoral student Donald Caspar. In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to University of California, Berkeley, and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one &quot;she might have loved, might have married&quot;. In her letter to Sayre, Franklin described him as &quot;an ideal match&quot;.

===Illness, death, and burial===
In mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York, she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London, Franklin consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, &quot;You&#x27;re not pregnant?&quot; to which she retorted, &quot;I wish I were.&quot; Her case was marked &quot;URGENT&quot;. An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen. After this period and other periods of hospitalisation, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship, and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind&#x27;s nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.

Franklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother&#x27;s uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results – seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957. At the end of 1957 Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the Royal Marsden Hospital. On 2 December she made her will. Franklin named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive £3,000 and her Austin car. Of her other friends, Mair Livingstone would get £2,000, Anne Piper £1,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith £250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.

Franklin returned to work in January 1958 and was also given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February. She fell ill again on 30 March and died a few weeks later on 16 April 1958 in Chelsea, London, of bronchopneumonia, secondary carcinomatosis, and ovarian cancer. Exposure to X-ray radiation is sometimes considered to be a possible factor in Franklin&#x27;s illness.
Other members of her family have died of cancer, and the incidence of gynaecological cancer is known to be disproportionately high among Ashkenazi Jews. Franklin&#x27;s death certificate states: &quot;A Research Scientist, Spinster, Daughter of Ellis Arthur Franklin, a Banker.&quot; She was interred on 17 April 1958 in the family plot at Willesden United Synagogue Cemetery at Beaconsfield Road in London Borough of Brent. The inscription on her tombstone reads:

IN MEMORY OF ROSALIND ELSIE FRANKLIN מ&#x27; רחל בת ר&#x27; יהודה [Rochel/Rachel daughter of Yehuda, her father&#x27;s Hebrew name] DEARLY LOVED ELDER DAUGHTER OF ELLIS AND MURIEL FRANKLIN 25 JULY 1920 – 16 APRIL 1958 SCIENTIST HER RESEARCH AND DISCOVERIES ON VIRUSES REMAIN OF LASTING BENEFIT TO MANKIND ת נ צ ב ה [Hebrew initials for &quot;her soul shall be bound in the bundle of life&quot;]
Franklin&#x27;s will was proven on 30 June with her estate assessed for probate at £11,278 10s. 9d. (equivalent to £ in ).

==Controversies after death==
===Alleged sexism toward Franklin===
Anne Sayre, Franklin&#x27;s friend and one of her biographers, says in her 1975 book, &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA: &quot; &quot;In 1951 ... King&#x27;s College London as an institution, was not distinguished for the welcome that it offered to women ... Rosalind ... was unused to &quot;purdah&quot; [a religious and social institution of female seclusion] ... there was one other female on the laboratory staff&quot;. The molecular biologist Andrzej Stasiak notes: &quot;Sayre&#x27;s book became widely cited in feminist circles for exposing rampant sexism in science.&quot; Farooq Hussain says: &quot;there were seven women in the biophysics department ... Jean Hanson became an FRS, Dame Honor B. Fell, Director of Strangeways Laboratory, supervised the biologists&quot;. Maddox, Franklin&#x27;s biographer, states: &quot;Randall ... did have many women on his staff ... they found him ... sympathetic and helpful.&quot;

Sayre asserts that &quot;while the male staff at King&#x27;s lunched in a large, comfortable, rather clubby dining room&quot; the female staff of all ranks &quot;lunched in the student&#x27;s hall or away from the premises&quot;. However, Elkin claims that most of the MRC group (including Franklin) typically ate lunch together in the mixed dining room discussed below. And Maddox says, of Randall: &quot;He liked to see his flock, men and women, come together for morning coffee, and at lunch in the joint dining room, where he ate with them nearly every day.&quot; Francis Crick also commented that &quot;her colleagues treated men and women scientists alike&quot;.

Sayre also discusses at length Franklin&#x27;s struggle in pursuing science, particularly her father&#x27;s concern about women in academic professions. This account had led to accusations of sexism in regard to Ellis Franklin&#x27;s attitude to his daughter. A good deal of information explicitly claims that he strongly opposed her entering Newnham College. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) biography of Franklin goes further, stating that he refused to pay her fees, and that an aunt stepped in to do that for her. Her sister, Jenifer Glynn, has stated that those stories are myths, and that her parents fully supported Franklin&#x27;s entire career.

Sexism is said to pervade the memoir of one peer, James Watson, in his book &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, published 10 years after Franklin&#x27;s death and after Watson had returned from Cambridge to Harvard. His Cambridge colleague, Peter Pauling, wrote in a letter, &quot;Morris [&quot;sic&quot;] Wilkins is supposed to be doing this work; Miss Franklin is evidently a fool.&quot; Crick acknowledges later, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid we always used to adopt – let&#x27;s say, a &quot;patronizing&quot; attitude towards her.&quot;

Glynn accuses Sayre of erroneously making her sister a feminist heroine, and sees Watson&#x27;s &quot;The Double Helix&quot; as the root of what she calls the &quot;Rosalind Industry&quot;. She conjectures that the stories of alleged sexism would &quot;have embarrassed her [Rosalind Franklin] almost as much as Watson&#x27;s account would have upset her&quot;, and declared that &quot;she [Rosalind] was never a feminist.&quot; Klug and Crick have also concurred that Franklin was definitely not a feminist.

Franklin&#x27;s letter to her parents in January 1939 is often taken as reflecting her own prejudiced attitude, and the claim that she was &quot;not immune to the sexism rampant in these circles&quot;. In the letter, she remarked that one lecturer was &quot;very good, though female&quot;. Maddox maintains that was a circumstantial comment rather than an example of gender bias, and that it was an expression of admiration because, at the time, woman teachers of science were a rarity. In fact, Maddox says, Franklin laughed at men who were embarrassed by the appointment of the first female professor, Dorothy Garrod.

===Contribution to the model/structure of DNA===
Franklin&#x27;s first important contributions to the model popularised by Crick and Watson was her lecture at the seminar in November 1951, where she presented to those present, among them Watson, the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, her position being that the phosphate units are located in the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance for the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and articulate these facts, which constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to the construction of an incorrect three-helical model.

The other contribution included a photograph of an X-ray diffaction pattern of B-DNA (called &quot;Photo 51&quot;), taken by Franklin&#x27;s student Gosling, that was briefly shown to Watson by Wilkins in January 1953, and a report written for an MRC biophysics committee visit to King&#x27;s in December 1952 which was shown by Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory to both Crick and Watson. This MRC report contained data from the King&#x27;s group, including some of Franklin&#x27;s and Gosling&#x27;s work, and was given to Crick – who was working on his thesis on haemoglobin structure – by his thesis supervisor Perutz, a member of the visiting committee.

Sayre&#x27;s biography of Franklin contains a story alleging that the photograph 51 in question was shown to Watson by Wilkins without Franklin&#x27;s permission, and that this constituted a case of bad science ethics. Others dispute this story, asserting that Wilkins had been given photograph 51 by Franklin&#x27;s Ph.D. student Gosling because she was leaving King&#x27;s to work at Birkbeck. There was allegedly nothing untoward in this transfer of data to Wilkins because Director Randall had insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King&#x27;s. He had therefore instructed Franklin, in a letter, to even stop working on it and submit her data. It was also implied, by Horace Freeland Judson, that Maurice Wilkins had taken the photograph out of Franklin&#x27;s drawer, but this is also said to be incorrect.

Likewise, Perutz saw &quot;no harm&quot; in showing an MRC report containing the conclusions of Franklin and Gosling&#x27;s X-ray data analysis to Crick, since it had not been marked as confidential, although &quot;The report was not expected to reach outside eyes&quot;. Indeed, after the publication of Watson&#x27;s &quot;The Double Helix&quot; exposed Perutz&#x27;s act, he received so many letters questioning his judgment that he felt the need to both answer them all and to post a general statement in &quot;Science&quot; excusing himself on the basis of being &quot;inexperienced and casual in administrative matters&quot;.

Perutz also claimed that the MRC information was already made available to the Cambridge team when Watson had attended Franklin&#x27;s seminar in November 1951. A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.

The Perutz letter was, as said, one of three, published with others by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin&#x27;s lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that, when Crick and Watson started to build their model, in February 1953, they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King&#x27;s. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model, but Gosling, when asked in his 2013 interview if he believed she learned of this before her death, asserted &quot;Yes. Oh, she did know about that.&quot;

In 2023 an unpublished article for &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1953 revealed two documents that showed a close collaboration of Franklin with Watson and Crick. Reporting in &quot;Nature&quot;, Comfort and Cobb suggested new evidence in an opinion piece that Franklin was a contributor and &quot;equal player&quot; in process leading to the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA, rather than otherwise, concluding that &quot;the discovery of the structure of DNA was not seen [in 1953] as a race won by Watson and Crick, but as the outcome of a joint effort.&quot; One manuscript written by Joan Bruce, a London journalist for &quot;Time&quot;, was never published and stored among Franklin&#x27;s papers. It was prepared in consultation with Franklin, who saw that Bruce&#x27;s scientific presentation was not good enough for an article. Bruce clearly mentioned that &quot;they [Franklin and Wilkins with Watson and Crick] linked up, confirming each other&#x27;s work from time to time, or wrestling over a common problem,&quot; and that Franklin was often &quot;checking the Cavendish model against her own X-rays, not always confirming the Cavendish structural theory.&quot; Another document, a letter of Pauline Cowan from King&#x27;s College inviting Crick to attend Franklin&#x27;s lecture in January 1953, indicated that Crick was already familiar with the DNA data available at the time. In an interview in &quot;Science News&quot;, Comfort and Cobb agreed that there were never stealing of any data, as the two teams shared their research information willingly.

====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====
Upon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King&#x27;s had made to the discovery. There is no doubt that Franklin&#x27;s experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.

Indeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King&#x27;s to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the &quot;Acta &quot;articles in press, or most easily, the third &quot;Nature&quot; paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox&#x27;s widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. &quot;Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins&quot;.

Fifteen years after the fact the first clear recitation of Franklin&#x27;s contribution appeared as it permeated Watson&#x27;s account, &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, although it was buried under descriptions of Watson&#x27;s (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling&#x27;s mistaken DNA manuscript. Watson&#x27;s words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.

Sayre&#x27;s early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having &quot;been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King&#x27;s College London&quot;. In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling&#x27;s publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, served as the principal evidence:Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication.

===Nobel Prize===
Franklin was never nominated for a Nobel Prize. Her work was a crucial part in the discovery of DNA&#x27;s structure, which, along with subsequent related work, led to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962. Franklin had died in 1958, and during her lifetime, the DNA structure was not considered to be fully proven. It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure. Moreover, its biological significance, as proposed by Watson and Crick, was not established. General acceptance for the DNA double helix and its function did not start until late in the 1950s, leading to Nobel nominations in 1960, 1961, and 1962 for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and in 1962 for Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The first breakthrough was from Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958, who experimentally showed the DNA replication of a bacterium, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. In what is now known as the Meselson–Stahl experiment, DNA was found to replicate into two double-stranded helices, with each helix having one of the original DNA strands. This DNA replication was firmly established by 1961 after further demonstration in other species, and of the stepwise chemical reaction. According to the 1961 Crick–Monod letter, this experimental proof, along with Wilkins having initiated the DNA diffraction work, were the reasons why Crick felt that Wilkins should be included in the DNA Nobel Prize.

In 1962 the Nobel Prize was subsequently awarded to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins. Nobel rules now prohibit posthumous nominations (though this statute was not formally in effect until 1974) or splitting of Prizes more than three ways. The award was for their body of work on nucleic acids and not exclusively for the discovery of the structure of DNA. By the time of the award Wilkins had been working on the structure of DNA for more than 10 years, and had done much to confirm the Watson–Crick model. Crick had been working on the genetic code at Cambridge and Watson had worked on RNA for some years. Watson has suggested that ideally Wilkins and Franklin would have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Pauling, who received the Nobel Peace Prize that year, believed and earlier warned the Nobel Committee in 1960 that &quot;it might well be premature to make an award of a Prize to Watson and Crick, because of existing uncertainty about the detailed structure of nucleic acid. I myself feel that it is likely that the general nature of the Watson-Crick structure is correct, but that there is doubt about details.&quot; He was partly right as an alternative of Watson-Crick base pairing, called the Hoogsteen base pairing that can form triple DNA strand, was discovered by Karst Hoogsteen in 1963.

Aaron Klug, Franklin&#x27;s colleague and principal beneficiary in her will, was the sole winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1982, &quot;for his development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his structural elucidation of biologically important nucleic acid-protein complexes&quot;. This work was exactly what Franklin had started and which she introduced to Klug, and it is highly plausible that, were she alive, Franklin would have shared the Nobel Prize.

Franklin&#x27;s part in the discovery of the nature of DNA was shown in the 1987 TV film &quot;Life Story&quot;, starring Juliet Stevenson as Franklin, and with Tim Pigott-Smith as Crick, Alan Howard as Wilkins and Jeff Goldblum as Watson. The film portrayed Franklin as somewhat stern, but also alleged that Watson and Crick did use a lot of her work to do theirs.

A 56-minute documentary of the life and scientific contributions of Franklin, &quot;DNA – Secret of Photo 51&quot;, was broadcast in 2003 on PBS &quot;Nova&quot;. Narrated by Barbara Flynn, the program features interviews with Wilkins, Gosling, Klug, Maddox, including Franklin&#x27;s friends Vittorio Luzzati, Caspar, Anne Piper, and Sue Richley. The UK version produced by BBC is titled &quot;Rosalind Franklin: DNA&#x27;s Dark Lady&quot;.

The first episode of another PBS documentary serial, &quot;DNA&quot;, was aired on 4 January 2004. The episode titled &quot;The Secret of Life&quot; centres much around the contributions of Franklin. Narrated by Jeff Goldblum, it features Watson, Wilkins, Gosling and Peter Pauling (son of Linus Pauling).

A play entitled &quot;Rosalind: A Question of Life&quot; was written by Deborah Gearing to mark the work of Franklin, and was first performed on 1 November 2005 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, and published by Oberon Books in 2006.

Another play, &quot;Photograph 51&quot; by Anna Ziegler, published in 2011, has been produced at several places in the US and in late 2015 was put on at the Noel Coward Theatre, London, with Nicole Kidman playing Franklin. Ziegler&#x27;s version of the 1951–53 &#x27;race&#x27; for the structure of DNA sometimes emphasizes the pivotal role of Franklin&#x27;s research and her personality. Although sometimes altering history for dramatic effect, the play nevertheless illuminates many of the key issues of how science was and is conducted.

&quot;False Assumptions&quot; by Lawrence Aronovitch is a play about the life of Marie Curie in which Franklin is portrayed as frustrated and angry at the lack of recognition for her scientific contributions. Hostility between the two is also depicted in season 3 of &quot;Harvey Girls Forever&quot;.

Franklin was noted as the chemist who &quot;actually discovered DNA&quot; in episode three of the 2019 Netflix series &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

Franklin is fictionalised in Marie Benedict&#x27;s novel &quot;Her Hidden Genius&quot;, released in January 2022.

A musical, titled &quot;Double Helix&quot;, based on Franklin&#x27;s contribution to the discovery opened in May 2023 at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, New York.

Franklin&#x27;s image appeared in Pfizer&#x27;s 2024 Super Bowl commercial alongside other notable scientific pioneers.

<text>Bloomberg Wall Street Week (WSW), is an investment news and information TV program airing Friday nights on the Bloomberg Television. The original weekly show hosted by Louis Rukeyser aired each Friday evening on PBS in the United States from November 20, 1970, to 2005. The program features a host (or hosts) and guest experts participating in discussions related to the financial markets.

The original show, which was created by Anne Truax Darlington and produced by Maryland Public Television (MPT), debuted on the entire PBS network on November 20, 1970, and was officially titled Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser (W$W) during the 32 years he hosted from November 20, 1970, to March 22, 2002 (the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;Street&quot; was rendered and officially titled in television listings with a dollar sign).

In June 2002, the show was modified, dropping Rukeyser and changing the name to Wall Street Week with Fortune. Rukeyser went on to host &quot;Louis Rukeyser&#x27;s Wall Street&quot; on CNBC (cancelled on December 31, 2004, at Rukeyser&#x27;s request due to continuing ill health), which was also distributed to PBS stations. &quot;Wall Street Week with Fortune&quot;, as it was done under the partial aegis of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, was hosted by Geoff Colvin and former Fox News business correspondent Karen Gibbs, ended its PBS run on June 24, 2005.

Wall Street Week was resurrected on April 3, 2015, by SkyBridge Media LLC, an affiliated entity of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital, which was founded by financier and entrepreneur Anthony Scaramucci. The new &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; featured Anthony Scaramucci and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as co-hosts.

In March 2016, the show&#x27;s licensing rights were picked up by Fox Broadcasting Company and it began airing Friday nights at 8:00pm ET on the Fox Business Network. In April 2017, the show&#x27;s name was changed to reflect Fox Business naming Maria Bartiromo as the new presenter. In early 2018, Fox Business ceased its production of the Wall Street Week franchise, instead airing a new program titled &quot;Maria Bartiromo&#x27;s Wall Street.&quot;

==Show format==
===&quot;Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser&quot;===
* Commentary: Rukeyser would begin the program with a short commentary on the week&#x27;s financial news, followed by a summation of market statistics.
* Panel Discussion: A panel of financial analysts (usually three in number) offered their opinions on the market, and gave specific stock recommendations. Panelists over the years, who numbered close to 30 by the turn of the 20th century, included financial names like Frank Cappiello, Jim Price, Gail Dudack, Mary Farrell, Michael Holland, Carter Randall, Julius Westheimer and Martin Zweig.
* Viewer Mail: The panelists would answer questions submitted by viewers. This segment always ended with Rukeyser delivering a pun-laden solicitation for letters.
* Interview Prelude: Occasionally, before the final interview, Rukeyser would provide his insight on some aspects of business, such as a certain stock sector (e.g. food, medical, energy), the right choice for mutual funds, and even the best deals on various products. The most commonly repeated commentaries were &quot;Professor Lou&#x27;s Classroom&quot; (during the back-to-school season), &quot;Uncle Lou Goes Christmas Shopping&quot; (held in December, usually on the Friday before Christmas), and &quot;Sentiment-al Journey&quot; (New Year&#x27;s Eve).
* Interview: In the final segment, Rukeyser and the panelist interviewed a guest expert.
Over the years, the list of guests included such notables as Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ross Perot, John Kenneth Galbraith, Malcolm Forbes, and Paul Samuelson. 
====&quot;Ms. Smythe&quot;====
After being introduced, guests for the interview segment were escorted from backstage by a woman in formal dress dubbed by production staff and listed in the credits as &quot;Ms. Smythe&quot; (&quot;Miss Smythe&quot; until the late 1980s), always followed by her real name. Various women over the years performed this task, the most famous being Natalie Seltz.

====&quot;TWX in 12 Bars&quot;====
During Rukeyser&#x27;s original tenure, the program featured a distinctive theme composed by Donald Swartz entitled &quot;TWX in 12 Bars,&quot; which featured percussion supplied by a teletype machine. The opening bells of the song replicated the chimes at Trinity Episcopal Church at the end of Wall Street which includes the sound of the Westminster chimes. Updated versions of the iconic theme music have since been used in later incarnations of the series.

==== World Trade Center in Opening Sequence ====
The program&#x27;s opening sequence moves from the chimes to a pan across lower Manhattan that includes the South Tower of the original World Trade Center, providing a rare perspective where only one of the twin towers is visible. Nearby buildings in the footage indicate that the film was shot from the roof of 1 New York Plaza, a vantage point from which the South Tower—far taller than 1 New York Plaza—completely eclipsed the North Tower.

====New Year&#x27;s Show====
On the last Friday of the year, the host and panelists would appear in black tie, make market predictions and stock recommendations for the upcoming year, and review how well their predictions of one year ago fared.

====Alternative format====
On October 23, 1987, the first program following Black Monday, the show dropped its regular format for a special program where Rukeyser interviewed three experts on the impact of the stock market crash.

Afterwards, the show would employ this alternative format whenever events warranted, usually once every few months.

====Stand-ins for Rukeyser====
Whenever Rukeyser was on vacation or otherwise absent, one of the show&#x27;s regular panelists would fill in. For many years this function was usually performed by Carter Randall, though in later years it was usually Frank Cappiello or (less often) Martin Zweig after Randall died in 1999. Both Randall and Cappiello were investment bankers from Baltimore, convenient to where &quot;WSW&quot; was produced in Owings Mills, Maryland.

====&quot;An Investment Primer&quot; specials====
During the 1984 and 1985 pledge-drive seasons, Rukeyser hosted two &quot;Investment Primer&quot; specials, introducing viewers to the stock market and how it worked. The first show, which aired in 1984, dealt with stocks, bonds, and gold; whereas the second show in 1985 dealt with mutual funds, options and commodities. Some of the guests included Stan Weinstein (editor of &quot;The Professional Tape Reader&quot;), Peter Lynch (manager of the Magellan funds at Fidelity Investments), and Dick Fabian (editor for &quot;The Telephone Switch Newsletter&quot;)

===&quot;Wall Street Week with Fortune&quot;===
With the new hosts came a change in format:

* Opening report: Geoffrey Colvin and Karen Gibbs presented separate news reports on major stories impacting the market.
* Viewer Mail: The hosts answered questions from viewers.
* Interviews: The hosts conducted separate guest interviews; Gibbs handled interviews related to specific investing issues, while Colvin handled interviews relating to politics and the overall economy.
* Closing Commentary: A brief commentary by Colvin.

The new show&#x27;s theme music was an updated, more orchestral version of &quot;TWX in 12 Bars&quot;, produced again by Don Swartz and Don Barto.

Without Louis Rukeyser as host, this new version suffered from lower ratings, neither capturing a new more youthful market as PBS had intended, nor retaining the original viewers. It was canceled after three seasons.

===Wall Street Week Index===
During its run, the show used two different indexes to predict future market trends:

From 1970 to 1989, the show used the Wall Street Week Index (later known as the WSW Technical Market Index), a composed financial index developed by Robert Nurock. The analysis consisted of ten separate technical indicators, each of which was assigned a value of either +1 (indicating a bullish trend), -1 (for a bearish trend, or 0 (neutral)). A net balance of +5 (or higher) was interpreted as a buy signal, while a reading of -5 (or lower) was a sell signal. Rukeyser irreverently named the index &quot;The Elves&quot; (a reference to the term &quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot;), and dubbed Nurock the &quot;Chief Elf.&quot; After being in neutral for a considerable period of time, Rukeyser requested significant changes in the makeup of the index. Nurock refused since he believed his ten indicators were still the best way to judge the technical aspects of the market. This ended Nurock&#x27;s association with the show and the Index was replaced.

Used from 1989 to the end of the Rukeyser era, the Elves Index was also a reading of ten indicators scored in the same manner as the Wall Street Week Index. Instead of reflecting technical factors, the indicators now represented the personal sentiment of ten market analysts about the direction of the market over the next three months. The Elves Index had more volatility and gave more buy and sell signals than the old Wall Street Week Index, but was not as highly regarded. In 1998, one magazine even suggested the Elves Index was more useful as a contrarian tool, citing three examples where buy signals were followed by periods of market drift or contraction. Later, Rukeyser added an Elves Index for the NASDAQ. This index had one of the worst predictive records of any public index.

The indexes were &quot;retired&quot; by Rukeyser after the September 11, 2001 attacks. At that point, the indexes were signalling a very strong sell signal. However, as was usually the case, it was an excellent time to do the opposite as the market rallied significantly after the initial selloff.

==Show popularity==
The premiere of &quot;WSW&quot; on November 20, 1970, was carried on eleven stations of the Eastern Educational Television Network. The show rapidly grew in coverage and viewers until it became one of the most popular programs on the newly created PBS member stations. At its peak in the 1980s, the program aired on over 300 stations, and claimed a viewership of 4,100,000 households, which meant more people watched &quot;WSW&quot; every week than read the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. The program became a major source of profit for both MPT and PBS through underwriting support and viewer pledges (it is estimated PBS earned $5,000,000 profit annually from the show).

===The Rukeyser Effect===
Over the years, stock traders and analysts noted that a company touted on &quot;WSW&quot; on Friday would experience a run-up in its stock price the following Monday. This phenomenon, dubbed &quot;The Rukeyser Effect&quot;, was stated to be a further demonstration of the program&#x27;s influence. However, in 1987, Prof. Robert Pari of Bentley College published an academic article in the &quot;Journal of Portfolio Management&quot; detailing the results of a study that found that stocks recommended by Rukeyser&#x27;s guests on Wall Street Week not only tended to rise in price and trading volume in the days &quot;preceding&quot; the Friday evening broadcast, peaking on the Monday afterward, but thereafter those stocks tended to drop in price and under-perform the market for up to a year following the recommendation. Rukeyser strongly disputed this claim, but ten years later Professors Jess Beltz and Robert Jennings published another academic article in the &quot;Review of Financial Economics&quot; reporting results consistent with Pari&#x27;s original findings, and that there was &quot;little correlation between the 6-month performance of a recommendation and the abnormal volume at the date the recommendation is made.&quot; They observed that there were differences in return performance between the recommendations of different individuals, but the market could not discern the more insightful recommendations from the less insightful. Another commentator observed &quot;It is mathematically impossible for the thirty million viewers of this show to beat the market, since they are the market.&quot;

==Rukeyser as host==
Louis Rukeyser conducted the proceedings with a wry sense of humor (including the use of puns) and a reassuring manner. In 1980 Rukeyser explained his hosting philosophy to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as, &quot;I am talking to one person, whom I regard as intelligent, with a good sense of humor, but not all that technically knowledgeable.&quot; He instructed panelists and guests not to use technical jargon and economic theories on the show, but rather talk about making money, because, &quot;Economics puts people to sleep. Money wakes them up.&quot;

==Rukeyser&#x27;s dismissal==
From its ratings peak in the early 1980s, &quot;WSW&quot; suffered a long steady decline in viewers due to competition from shows such as the &quot;Nightly Business Report&quot;, cable programs like &quot;Moneyline&quot;, and cable networks such as CNBC. By 2001 viewership was down to 1,500,000 households and demographics showed that the average &quot;WSW&quot; viewer was 65 years old (about the same age as Rukeyser). MPT began to discuss the possibility of updating the format in an effort to reverse these trends. On March 21, 2002, MPT announced that beginning in June the program would be renamed &quot;Wall Street Week with Fortune&quot;, would be a collaboration between MPT and Fortune magazine, and would feature two new cohosts. Rukeyser was invited to remain with the program in a reduced role as a senior correspondent, but he turned down the offer.

The following evening, Rukeyser opened the telecast by announcing &quot;A funny thing happened to me on the way to the studio this week—I got ambushed.&quot; He criticized MPT&#x27;s decision to change the show format, announced that he was developing a new business program for PBS, and concluded his commentary by asking viewers to write to their local PBS station and request it carry his new show. After the broadcast MPT dismissed Rukeyser and executive producer Rich Dubroff. Over the next three months Marshall Loeb and Ray Brady served as guest hosts while the new format was put in place.

Despite &quot;ambushing&quot; Rukeyser, the show&#x27;s trend of losing viewers continued as the show floundered on without Rukeyser&#x27;s trusted presence and was terminated in early 2005.

In 2011, Maryland Public Television anchor Jeff Salkin licensed the name to start a website offering video interviews and newsletters for an annual fee. The URL now redirects to the MPT website.

On January 23, 2025, Louis Rukeyser&#x27;s final episode of &quot;WSW&quot; was uploaded to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting and is available for public viewing.

==SkyBridge revival of &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; franchise==

In May 2014, SkyBridge Capital acquired licensing rights to &quot;Wall Street Week&quot;, creating a new entity, SkyBridge Media, for the purpose of re-launching the show.

The new &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; originally featured SkyBridge founder and managing partner Anthony Scaramucci and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as hosts, and the format has been refreshed to maintain the spirit of the original show while modernizing certain aspects of the presentation.

The first episode of the new &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; aired April 19, 2015 and was streamed from its website, WallStreetWeek.com. Airtime for the show was purchased on television stations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. The first episode featured special guest &quot;bond king&quot; Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital and panelists Liz Ann Sonders (who was a frequent panelist on the original &quot;Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser&quot;) of Charles Schwab and Jonathan Beinner of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gundlach&#x27;s commentary on the show, where he called for a potential crash in the junk bond market, made news across Wall Street following the premiere.

==Brief stint on Fox Business Network ==
The show was picked up by Fox Business Network for a brief period with its first episode airing there on March 18, 2016. Scaramucci stepped away from his position hosting the show after Donald Trump added him to his transition team as an economic advisor. Maria Bartiromo was named by Fox Business as the show&#x27;s permanent anchor in April 2017.

Fox Business Network aired the program every Friday night at 8 pm ET on with the replays airing Friday nights at 8:30 PM ET, 12 and 12:30 AM ET, and Saturday and Sunday mornings at 9 &amp; 9:30 AM ET.

Again, the opening bars (only) of &quot;TWX in 12 Bars&quot; is used for the opening, with a quote attributed to Rukeyser, &quot;This show has never been solely about investments. We&#x27;ve talked about anything that affected people and their money,&quot; with both Scaramucci and Kaminsky featured in the opening.

In January 2018, Fox Business Network ceased its production and broadcasting of &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; opting instead to establish a new program, which was to be titled &quot;Maria Bartiromo&#x27;s Wall Street&quot;, in its place.

==&quot;Bloomberg Wall Street Week&quot;==
Bloomberg began airing a new version of the series, titled Bloomberg Wall Street Week, on January 10, 2020, with David Westin as the show&#x27;s anchor. As with the previous Fox edition, a newly recorded version of the &quot;TWX In 12 Bars&quot; theme was commissioned for this latest series.

<text>Puy-de-Dôme (; or &quot;lo Puèi Domat&quot;) is a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in the centre of France. In 2021, it had a population of 662,285. Its prefecture is Clermont-Ferrand and subprefectures are Ambert, Issoire, Riom, and Thiers.

Named after the Puy de Dôme dormant volcano, its inhabitants were called &quot;Puydedomois&quot; in French until 2005. With effect from 2006, in response to a letter writing campaign, the name used for the inhabitants was changed by the Puy-de-Dôme General Council to &quot;Puydômois&quot;; this is the name that has since then been used in all official documents and publications.

==History==
Puy-de-Dôme is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Auvergne. Originally, the department was to be called &quot;Mont-d&#x27;Or&quot; (&quot;Golden Mountain&quot;), but this was changed to Puy-de-Dôme following the intervention of Jean-François Gaultier de Biauzat, a local deputy, because of a concern that the name originally chosen risked attracting excessive unwelcome attention from the national taxation authorities.

==Geography==
Puy-de-Dôme is part of the current region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and is bordered by the departments of Loire, Haute-Loire, Cantal, Corrèze, Allier, and Creuse. Parts of the department belong to the Parc naturel régional des Volcans d&#x27;Auvergne and Parc naturel régional Livradois-Forez.

The department is in the Massif Central and boasts more than 80 volcanic craters. It is three hours from Paris and an hour from Lyon by highways A71 and A89. The A75 links it to the Mediterranean Sea.

===Principal towns===
The most populous commune is Clermont-Ferrand, the prefecture. As of 2021, there are 10 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Economy==
The departmental seat, Clermont-Ferrand, is home to one of the country&#x27;s best known manufacturing businesses and brands, Michelin. Thiers is the oldest industry place in Auvergne with its cutlery tradition from the 14th century.

The countryside lends itself to tourism and Puy-de-Dôme is a weekend destination for city dwellers. As of 2019, 10.1% of the usable homes in the department were being kept as second homes.

==Politics==
The department was the electoral constituency of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, who served as President of the Republic from 1974 to 1981. The president of the Departmental Council is Lionel Chauvin, elected in July 2021.

<doc id="90494" wikidata="Q12652" url="?curid=90494" title="Moselle (department)">
<text>Moselle () is the most populous department in Lorraine, in the northeast of France, and is named after the river Moselle, a tributary of the Rhine, which flows through the western part of the department. It had a population of 1,046,543 in 2019. Inhabitants of the department are known as &quot;Mosellans&quot;.

== History ==

On 4 March 1790 Moselle became one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution.

In 1793, France annexed the enclaves of Manderen, Momerstroff, and the County of Kriechingen – all possessions of princes of the Duchy of Luxemburg – a state of the Holy Roman Empire, and incorporated them into the Moselle department. In 1795, the &quot;seigneurie de Lixing&quot; was also integrated into the Moselle department. One of its first prefects was the comte de Vaublanc, from 1805 to 1814.

By the Treaty of Paris of 1814 following the first defeat and abdication of Napoleon, France had to surrender almost all the territory it had conquered since 1792. In northeastern France, the Treaty did not restore the 1792 borders, however, but defined a new frontier to put an end to the convoluted nature of the border, with all its enclaves and exclaves. As a result, France ceded the exclave of Tholey (now in Saarland, Germany) as well as a few communes near Sierck-les-Bains (both territories until then part of the Moselle department) to Austria. On the other hand, the Treaty confirmed the French annexations of 1793, and furthermore, the south of the Napoleonic department of Sarre was ceded to France, including the town of Lebach, the city of Saarbrücken, and the rich coal basin nearby. France thus became a net beneficiary of the Treaty of Paris: all the new territories ceded to her being far larger and more strategically useful than the few territories ceded to Austria. All these new territories were incorporated into the Moselle department, and giving Moselle a larger area than it had had since 1790.

However, with the return of Napoleon (March 1815) and his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (June 1815), the Treaty of Paris in November 1815 imposed much harsher conditions on France. Tholey and the communes around Sierck-les-Bains were still to be ceded as agreed in 1814, but the south of the Sarre department with Saarbrücken was withdrawn from France. In addition, France had to cede to Austria the area of Rehlingen (now in Saarland) as well as the strategic fort-town of Saarlouis and the territory around it, all territories and towns which France had controlled since the 17th century, and which had formed part of the Moselle department since 1790. At the end of 1815, Austria transferred all these territories to Prussia, making for the first time a shared border for those two states.

Thus, by the end of 1815, the Moselle department finally had the limits that it would keep until 1871. It was slightly smaller than at its creation in 1790, the incorporation of the Austrian enclaves not compensating for the loss of Saarlouis, Rehlingen, Tholey, and the communes around Sierck-les-Bains. Between 1815 and 1871, the department had an area of . Its prefecture (capital) was Metz. It had four arrondissements: Metz, Briey, Sarreguemines, and Thionville.

After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, almost all of the Moselle department, along with Alsace and portions of the Meurthe and Vosges departments, went to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt on the grounds that most of the population in those areas spoke German dialects. Bismarck omitted only one-fifth of Moselle (the arrondissement of Briey in the extreme west of the department) from annexation, (Bismarck later regretted his decision when it was discovered that the region of Briey and Longwy had rich iron-ore deposits.) The Moselle department ceased to exist on 18 May 1871, and the eastern four-fifths of Moselle was annexed to Germany merged with the also German-annexed eastern third of the Meurthe Department into the German Department of Lorraine, based in Metz, within the newly established Imperial State of Alsace-Lorraine. France merged the remaining area of Briey with the truncated Meurthe department to create the new Meurthe-et-Moselle department (a new name chosen on purpose to remind people of the lost Moselle department) with its &quot;préfecture&quot; at Nancy.

In 1919, following the French victory in the First World War, Germany returned Alsace-Lorraine to France under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, it was decided not to recreate the old separate departments of Meurthe and Moselle by reverting to the old department borders of before 1871. Instead, Meurthe-et-Moselle was left untouched, and the annexed part of Lorraine (Bezirk Lothringen) was reconstituted as the new department of Moselle. Thus, the Moselle department was reborn, but with quite different borders from those before 1871. Having lost the area of Briey, it had now gained the areas of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg which before 1871 had formed one-third of the Meurthe department and which had been part of the &quot;Reichsland&quot; of &quot;Alsace-Lorraine&quot; since 1871.

The new Moselle department now reached its current area of , larger than the old Moselle because the areas of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg were far larger than the area of Briey and Longwy.

When the Second World War was declared on 3 September 1939, around 30% of Moselle&#x27;s territory lay between the Maginot Line and the German frontier. 302,732 people, around 45% of the department&#x27;s population, were evacuated to departments in central and western France during September 1939. Of those evacuated, around 200,000 returned after the war.

In spite of the 22 June 1940 armistice, Moselle was again annexed by Germany in July of that year by becoming part of the &quot;Gau Westmark&quot;. Adolf Hitler considered Moselle and Alsace parts of Germany, and as a result the inhabitants were drafted into the German Wehrmacht.

Several organized groups were formed in resistance to the German occupation, notably the Groupe Mario, led by Jean Burger, and the Groupe Derhan. During these years more than 10,000 Mosellans were deported to camps, many to the Sudetenland, for publicly opposing the annexation.

The United States Army liberated Moselle from Nazi Germany in the Battle of Metz in September 1944, although combat continued in the northeastern part of the department until March 1945. Moselle was returned to French governance in 1945 with the same frontiers as in 1919.

The department was hit particularly hard during the war: the American bombardments in the spring of 1944 caused widespread collateral damage; 23% of the communes in Moselle were 50% destroyed, and 8% of the communes were than 75% destroyed.

As a result of German aggression during the war, the French Government actively discouraged the German heritage of the region, and the local German Lorraine Franconian dialects ceased to be used in the public realm. In recent years there has been a revival of the old dialects and distinct Franco-German culture of the region with the onset of open borders between France and Germany as members of the European Union&#x27;s Schengen Treaty.

== Geography ==
Moselle is part of the current region of Grand Est and is surrounded by the French departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Bas-Rhin, as well as Germany (states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate) and Luxembourg in the north. Parts of Moselle belong to Parc naturel régional de Lorraine.

The following are the most important rivers:
* Moselle
* Sarre
* Seille

The department is geographically organized around the Moselle valley. The region was long considered a march between Alsace and the north, remaining relatively poor until the 19th century, and was consequently less urbanized and populous than other regions at the time.

=== Environment ===

The environment has undergone heavy industrialization linked to iron deposits in Lorraine, which have artificialized valleys and river banks. Industries have created vast land holdings in the valleys by buying land from agriculturists and profiting from water rights.

Questions of environmental degradation were politicized at the end of the 19th century. Since then, one academic has argued that a consensus has been reached in the region regarding pollution, which is seen as the price of continuing the steel industry.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Metz, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

== Economy ==
In the 19th century, Moselle&#x27;s economy was characterized by heavy industry, especially steel and iron works. After the weakening of these industries at the end of the 20th century, the department has tried to promote new economic activities based on industry and technology, such as the Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant.

The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Moselle created the &quot;Achat-Moselle&quot; website in the 2000s to address issues of e-commerce and in-person commerce. The site helps local businesses to create pages showcasing their services, boosting their visibility and potential activity.

== Demographics ==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Mosellans&quot; in French.
The population has remained relatively stable since World War II and now exceeds 1 million, located mostly in the urban area around Metz and along the river Moselle.

If the Moselle department still existed in its limits of between 1815 and 1871, its population at the 1999 French census would have been 1,089,804 inhabitants. The current Moselle department, whose limits were set in 1919, had less population, with only 1,023,447 inhabitants. This is because the industrial area of Briey and Longwy lost in 1871 is more populated than the rural areas of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg gained in 1919. The southern part of the department, especially around Saulnois, has remained more rural.

A significant minority of inhabitants of the department (fewer than 100,000) speak a German dialect known as &quot;platt lorrain&quot; or &quot;Lothringer Platt&quot; (see Lorraine Franconian and Linguistic boundary of Moselle). The German dialect is found primarily in the northeast section of the department, which borders Alsace, Luxembourg, and Germany. Four sites in Moselle were included in the Atlas Linguarum Europae, to investigate the Germanic dialects used in these areas: Arzviller, Guessling, Petit-Réderching and Rodemack.

Linguistically, &quot;Platt&quot; can be further subdivided into three varieties, going from east to west: Rhenish Franconian, Moselle Franconian, and Luxembourgish.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Patrick Weiten, elected in 2011.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

== Culture ==
Eastern Moselle has preserved a number of local traditions, notably the Kirb festivals celebrated in October in rural areas, Mardi Gras parades in Sarreguemines, and the August mirabelle festival in Metz which includes a variety of cultural activities.

The Opéra-Théâtre de Metz, is the oldest active theater in France and has continuously operated from the 18th century. Metz also has a number of concert halls that offer diverse events such as comedy shows and symphony orchestras.

Thionville is home to the NEST (Nord-Est Théâtre).

== Law ==
Moselle and Alsace to its east have their own laws in certain fields. The statutes in question date primarily from the period 1871–1919 when the area was part of the German Empire. With the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France in 1919, many in central government assumed that the recovered territories would be subject to French law.

Local resistance to a total acceptance of French law arose because some of Bismarck&#x27;s reforms included strong protections for civil and social rights. After much discussion and uncertainty, Paris accepted in 1924 that pre-existing German law would apply in certain fields, notably hunting, economic life, local government relationships, health insurance, and social rights. Many of the relevant statues continue to be referred to in the original German, as they have never been formally translated.

One major difference with French law is the absence of the formal separation between church and state: several mainstream denominations of the Christian church as well as the Jewish faith benefit from state funding, despite principles applied rigorously in the rest of France.

== Tourism ==
Over the past twenty years the Conseil départemental de la Moselle has encouraged the development of tourism in the department. The creation of more hotels, camp sites, hiking trails, bicycle paths, and other tourist services have significantly increased the number of tourists in Moselle.

The Conseil départemental de la Moselle created an &quot;Organ Trail&quot; to display a number of the department&#x27;s 650 organs, many of which were built in the area and have historic significance. The oldest organ in the department dates is in the cathedral Saint-Étienne de Metz and dates from 1537. In the 19th century, Moselle had 17 operational organ factories, although only five exist in the present day.

Moselle has numerous chateaux, manors, and fortified manors, dating largely from the 17th and 18th centuries, many of which are partially destroyed.

<text>Manche (, ; Norman: ) is a coastal French &quot;département&quot; in Normandy on the English Channel, which is known as , literally &quot;the sleeve&quot;, in French. Manche is bordered by Ille-et-Vilaine and Mayenne to the south, Orne and Calvados to the east, the English Channel to the west and north and by sharing maritime borders with the Crown Dependencies of Bailiwick of Jersey and Bailiwick of Guernsey of the United Kingdom to the west. It had a population of 495,045 in 2019.

== History ==
Manche is one of the original 83 Departments of France, established during the French Revolution on 26 February 1790. It was created from part of the province of Normandy.

The capital was Coutances until 1796, and it resumed that role after World War II because of the almost complete destruction of Saint-Lô during the Battle of Normandy following D-Day. When Saint-Lô was rebuilt, it once again became the capital.

== Geography ==

The department includes the Cotentin Peninsula down to the famous Mont St Michel. Of the Channel Islands, only the island of Chausey forms part of the territory of the department.

Manche borders the Normandy departments of Calvados to the east and Orne to the southeast. Mayenne, a department of the Pays de la Loire, is to the south-east, and Ille-et-Vilaine in Brittany is to the south-west and it shares maritime borders with Bailiwick of Jersey and Bailiwick of Guernsey of the United Kingdom to the west. The salient of this department is the longest in France. It is also the second longest in Europe, after Odesa Oblast in Ukraine.

The region is lush and green with sandy beaches and remains oriented towards farming. The peninsula was originally joined as a single land mass to Cornwall and Dorset in England, meaning that the underlying geological strata of both regions are very similar. However, there are substantial regional differences today in terms of flora and fauna, and farming practices have varied considerably between the United Kingdom and France. Flat marsh areas in the department attract many bird-watchers. The region in and around St Lô is also the equestrian capital of France, where the cooler climate compared to the south is ideal for breeding and training.

France&#x27;s first EPR nuclear reactor is under construction at Flamanville near Cherbourg and is planned to start operations in late 2023.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Cherbourg-en-Cotentin; and the prefecture Saint-Lô is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are six communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

=== Climate ===
The climate is oceanic with relatively mild winters in which temperatures go below zero only for a few days. Summer temperatures are usually around 20 °C, and can occasionally reach 35 °C in direct sunlight. Precipitation is heavy but varies greatly by region, from 700mm on the coast to 1300mm in the southern central area. Highly localised but not life-threatening flash flooding has been experienced during the last few springs.

The west coast benefits from the influence of the Gulf Stream and this has enabled the naturalization of Mediterranean and exotic plants such as mimosas, palms, and agaves.

There is often a sea breeze on the coast, which combined with tides, contributes to rapid temperature changes in the course of a single day. Sea temperatures can be very pleasant for swimming between June and October.

== Demographics ==
Inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Manchots&quot; or &quot;Manchois&quot;.

Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Jean Morin, elected in July 2021.

<text>Isère ( , ; ; , ) is a landlocked department in the southeastern French region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Named after the river Isère, it had a population of 1,271,166 in 2019. Its prefecture is Grenoble. It borders Rhône to the northwest, Ain to the north, Savoie to the east, Hautes-Alpes to the south, Drôme and Ardèche to the southwest and Loire to the west.

== History ==

Isère is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was established from the main part of the former province of Dauphiné. Its area was reduced twice, in 1852 and again in 1967, on both occasions losing territory to the department of Rhône.

In 1852 in response to rapid urban development around the edge of Lyon, the (hitherto Isère) communes of Bron, Vaulx-en-Velin, Vénissieux and Villeurbanne were transferred to Rhône. In 1967 the redrawing of local government borders led to the creation of the Urban Community of Lyon (more recently known simply as Greater Lyon or Grand Lyon). At that time intercommunal groupings of this nature were not permitted to straddle departmental frontiers, and accordingly 23 more Isère communes (along with six communes from Ain) found themselves transferred to Rhône. The affected Isère communes were Chaponnay, Chassieu, Communay, Corbas, Décines-Charpieu, Feyzin, Genas, Jonage, Jons, Marennes, Meyzieu, Mions, Pusignan, Saint-Bonnet-de-Mure, Saint-Laurent-de-Mure, Saint-Pierre-de-Chandieu, Saint-Priest, Saint-Symphorien-d&#x27;Ozon, Sérézin-du-Rhône, Simandres, Solaize, Ternay and Toussieu.

Most recently, on 1 April 1971, Colombier-Saugnieu was transferred to Rhône. Banners appeared in the commune&#x27;s three little villages at the time proclaiming &quot;Dauphinois toujours&quot; (&quot;Always Dauphinois&quot;).

== Geography ==

Isère includes a part of the French Alps. The highest point in the department is the subpeak Pic Lory at , subsidiary to the Barre des Écrins in the adjoining Hautes-Alpes department. The summit of La Meije at is also well known. The Vercors Plateau aesthetically dominates the western part of the department.

The most populous commune is Grenoble, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Isérois&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Iséroises&quot; (feminine).

Population development since 1801:

== Politics ==
=== Departmental politics ===
The President of the Departmental Council has been Jean-Pierre Barbier of The Republicans (LR) since 2015.

Following the 2021 departmental election, the Departmental Council of Isère (58 seats) was composed as follows:

=== Representation in Paris ===
==== National Assembly ====
In the 2022 legislative election, Isère elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

In 2024, all the Renaissance and Democratic Movement candidates lost their seats: to La France Insoumise in the 1st and 9th constituencies, and to RN-coalition parties in the 8th and 10th. The other representatives were all reelected.

==== Senate ====
In the 2017 Senate election, Isère elected Didier Rambaud (La République En Marche!), Guillaume Gontard (miscellaneous left), Frédérique Puissat (The Republicans), Michel Savin (The Republicans) and André Vallini (Socialist Party) for the 2017–2023 term.

== Culture ==

The Grande Chartreuse is the mother abbey of the Carthusian order. It is located north of Grenoble.

As early as the 13th century, residents of the north and central parts of Isère spoke a dialect of the Franco-Provençal language called Dauphinois, while those in the Southern parts spoke the Vivaro-Alpine dialect of Occitan. Both continued to be spoken in rural areas of Isère into the 20th century.

== Tourism ==
Isère features many ski resorts, including the Alpe d&#x27;Huez, Les Deux Alpes, the 1968 Winter Olympics resorts of Chamrousse, Villard de Lans, Autrans. Other popular resorts include Les 7 Laux, Méaudre, Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse, Alpe du Grand Serre and Gresse-en-Vercors. At the department level, Isère is the third-largest ski and winter destination in France, after Savoie and Haute-Savoie. It also hosts Coupe Icare, an annual festival of free flight, such as paragliding and hang-gliding, held at the world-renowned paragliding site at Lumbin.

Grenoble has a dozen museums, including its most famous, established in 1798, the Museum of Grenoble. The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), an international research facility in Grenoble, is also open to visitors.

<text>In machine learning (ML), boosting is an ensemble metaheuristic for primarily reducing bias (as opposed to variance). It can also improve the stability and accuracy of ML classification and regression algorithms. Hence, it is prevalent in supervised learning for converting weak learners to strong learners.

The concept of boosting is based on the question posed by Kearns and Valiant (1988, 1989): &quot;Can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner?&quot; A weak learner is defined as a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification. A strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well-correlated with the true classification. Robert Schapire answered the question in the affirmative in a paper published in 1990. This has had significant ramifications in machine learning and statistics, most notably leading to the development of boosting.

Initially, the &quot;hypothesis boosting problem&quot; simply referred to the process of turning a weak learner into a strong learner. Algorithms that achieve this quickly became known as &quot;boosting&quot;. Freund and Schapire&#x27;s arcing (Adapt[at]ive Resampling and Combining), as a general technique, is more or less synonymous with boosting.

== Algorithms ==
While boosting is not algorithmically constrained, most boosting algorithms consist of iteratively learning weak classifiers with respect to a distribution and adding them to a final strong classifier. When they are added, they are weighted in a way that is related to the weak learners&#x27; accuracy. After a weak learner is added, the data weights are readjusted, known as &quot;re-weighting&quot;. Misclassified input data gain a higher weight and examples that are classified correctly lose weight. Thus, future weak learners focus more on the examples that previous weak learners misclassified.

There are many boosting algorithms. The original ones, proposed by Robert Schapire (a recursive majority gate formulation), and Yoav Freund (boost by majority), were not adaptive and could not take full advantage of the weak learners. Schapire and Freund then developed AdaBoost, an adaptive boosting algorithm that won the prestigious Gödel Prize.

Only algorithms that are provable boosting algorithms in the probably approximately correct learning formulation can accurately be called &quot;boosting algorithms&quot;. Other algorithms that are similar in spirit to boosting algorithms are sometimes called &quot;leveraging algorithms&quot;, although they are also sometimes incorrectly called boosting algorithms.

The main variation between many boosting algorithms is their method of weighting training data points and hypotheses. AdaBoost is very popular and the most significant historically as it was the first algorithm that could adapt to the weak learners. It is often the basis of introductory coverage of boosting in university machine learning courses. There are many more recent algorithms such as LPBoost, TotalBoost, BrownBoost, xgboost, MadaBoost, LogitBoost, and others. Many boosting algorithms fit into the AnyBoost framework, which shows that boosting performs gradient descent in a function space using a convex cost function.

==Object categorization in computer vision==

Given images containing various known objects in the world, a classifier can be learned from them to automatically classify the objects in future images. Simple classifiers built based on some image feature of the object tend to be weak in categorization performance. Using boosting methods for object categorization is a way to unify the weak classifiers in a special way to boost the overall ability of categorization.

===Problem of object categorization===
Object categorization is a typical task of computer vision that involves determining whether or not an image contains some specific category of object. The idea is closely related with recognition, identification, and detection. Appearance based object categorization typically contains feature extraction, learning a classifier, and applying the classifier to new examples. There are many ways to represent a category of objects, e.g. from shape analysis, bag of words models, or local descriptors such as SIFT, etc. Examples of supervised classifiers are Naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines, mixtures of Gaussians, and neural networks. However, research has shown that object categories and their locations in images can be discovered in an unsupervised manner as well.

===Status quo for object categorization===
The recognition of object categories in images is a challenging problem in computer vision, especially when the number of categories is large. This is due to high intra class variability and the need for generalization across variations of objects within the same category. Objects within one category may look quite different. Even the same object may appear unalike under different viewpoint, scale, and illumination. Background clutter and partial occlusion add difficulties to recognition as well. Humans are able to recognize thousands of object types, whereas most of the existing object recognition systems are trained to recognize only a few, e.g. human faces, cars, simple objects, etc. Research has been very active on dealing with more categories and enabling incremental additions of new categories, and although the general problem remains unsolved, several multi-category objects detectors (for up to hundreds or thousands of categories) have been developed. One means is by feature sharing and boosting.

===Boosting for binary categorization===
AdaBoost can be used for face detection as an example of binary categorization. The two categories are faces versus background. The general algorithm is as follows:
#Form a large set of simple features
#Initialize weights for training images
#For T rounds
##Normalize the weights
##For available features from the set, train a classifier using a single feature and evaluate the training error
##Choose the classifier with the lowest error
##Update the weights of the training images: increase if classified wrongly by this classifier, decrease if correctly
#Form the final strong classifier as the linear combination of the T classifiers (coefficient larger if training error is small)
After boosting, a classifier constructed from 200 features could yield a 95% detection rate under a formula_1 false positive rate.

Another application of boosting for binary categorization is a system that detects pedestrians using patterns of motion and appearance. This work is the first to combine both motion information and appearance information as features to detect a walking person. It takes a similar approach to the Viola-Jones object detection framework.

===Boosting for multi-class categorization===
Compared with binary categorization, multi-class categorization looks for common features that can be shared across the categories at the same time. They turn to be more generic edge like features. During learning, the detectors for each category can be trained jointly. Compared with training separately, it generalizes better, needs less training data, and requires fewer features to achieve the same performance.
The main flow of the algorithm is similar to the binary case. What is different is that a measure of the joint training error shall be defined in advance. During each iteration the algorithm chooses a classifier of a single feature (features that can be shared by more categories shall be encouraged). This can be done via converting multi-class classification into a binary one (a set of categories versus the rest), or by introducing a penalty error from the categories that do not have the feature of the classifier.

In the paper &quot;Sharing visual features for multiclass and multiview object detection&quot;, A. Torralba et al. used GentleBoost for boosting and showed that when training data is limited, learning via sharing features does a much better job than no sharing, given same boosting rounds. Also, for a given performance level, the total number of features required (and therefore the run time cost of the classifier) for the feature sharing detectors, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of class, i.e., slower than linear growth in the non-sharing case. Similar results are shown in the paper &quot;Incremental learning of object detectors using a visual shape alphabet&quot;, yet the authors used AdaBoost for boosting.

== Convex vs. non-convex boosting algorithms ==

Boosting algorithms can be based on convex or non-convex optimization algorithms. Convex algorithms, such as AdaBoost and LogitBoost, can be &quot;defeated&quot; by random noise such that they can&#x27;t learn basic and learnable combinations of weak hypotheses. This limitation was pointed out by Long &amp; Servedio in 2008. However, by 2009, multiple authors demonstrated that boosting algorithms based on non-convex optimization, such as BrownBoost, can learn from noisy datasets and can specifically learn the underlying classifier of the Long–Servedio dataset.

<doc id="90501" wikidata="Q84170" url="?curid=90501" title="Labrador Peninsula">
<text>The Labrador Peninsula, also called Quebec-Labrador Peninsula, is a large peninsula in eastern Canada. It is bounded by Hudson Bay to the west, the Hudson Strait to the north, the Labrador Sea to the east, Strait of Belle Isle and the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the southeast. The peninsula includes the region of Labrador, which is part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the regions of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Côte-Nord, and Nord-du-Québec, which are in the province of Quebec. It has an area of .

==Location and geography==
The peninsula is surrounded by sea on all sides, except for the southwest where it widens into the general continental mainland. The northwestern part of the Labrador Peninsula is shaped as a lesser peninsula, the Ungava Peninsula, surrounded by Hudson Bay, the Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay. The northernmost point of the Ungava Peninsula, Cape Wolstenholme, also serves as the northernmost point of the Labrador Peninsula and of the province of Quebec. The peninsula is a plateau threaded by river valleys. There are several mountain ranges. The Torngat Mountains, located in the northern part of the peninsula, contain the highest point of the peninsula, Mount Caubvick, which at is also the highest point of mainland Canada east of Alberta. The mountains also host Torngat Mountains National Park, the only national park of Canada on the Labrador Peninsula. The park is located in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, whereas the adjacent Kuururjuaq National Park is located in the province of Quebec.

===Hydrology===
Due to it being covered almost entirely by the Canadian Shield — a vast, rocky plateau with a history of glaciation — the peninsula has a large number of lakes. The province of Quebec alone has more than half a million lakes of varying size. The largest body of water on the Labrador Peninsula is the Smallwood Reservoir, but the largest natural lake is Lake Mistassini. Other lakes of note include the Manicouagan Reservoir, the Caniapiscau Reservoir, and the La Grande 2 and La Grande 3 reservoirs. Due to a history of hydroelectric development, the majority of the larger freshwater lakes on the peninsula are reservoirs. In addition to an abundance of lakes, the peninsula also has many rivers. The longest, the La Grande River, is long and flows westwards across nearly half the peninsula. Other rivers of note include the Eastmain River, Rupert River, and Churchill River.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the peninsula was inhabited chiefly by Cree people, notably the Innu Nation in the southeast area of the peninsula, who referred to their country as &quot;Nitassinan&quot; (ᓂᑕᔅᓯᓇᓐ), meaning &quot;our land&quot; in the Innu language. Other peoples on the peninsula include the East Cree of Eeyou Istchee (ᐄᔨᔨᐤ/ᐄᔨᔫ/ᐄᓅ ᐊᔅᒌ), the Naskapi whose territories are called &quot;St&#x27;aschinuw&quot; (ᒋᑦ ᐊᔅᒋᓄᐤ, also meaning &quot;our land&quot;) as well as the Inuit of Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and NunatuKavut. The area became known as &quot;Markland&quot; in Greenlandic Norse and its inhabitants were known as the &quot;Skræling&quot;.

It is widely accepted that the peninsula is named after Portuguese explorer João Fernandes Lavrador. He was granted a patent by King Manuel I of Portugal in 1499 that gave him the right to explore that part of the Atlantic Ocean as set out in the Treaty of Tordesillas. Together with Pero de Barcelos, he first sighted Labrador in 1498, and charted the coasts of southwestern Greenland and of adjacent the northeastern North America around 1498 and gave notice of them in Portugal and Europe. His landowner status allowed him to use the title &quot;lavrador&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;landholder&quot;, but &quot;labrador&quot; in Spanish and Galician means &quot;agricultural worker&quot; (). He actually gave the name of &quot;Terra do Lavrador&quot; to Greenland, which was the first land that he sighted, but eventually, the name was spread to all areas until it was set for Labrador.

<text>Ardèche (; , ; ) is a department in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Southeastern France. It is named after the river Ardèche and had a population of 328,278 as of 2019. Its prefecture is in Privas, but its largest city is Annonay.

== History ==

===Prehistory and ancient history===
Humans have inhabited the area at least since the Upper Paleolithic, as attested by the famous cave paintings at Chauvet Pont d&#x27;Arc. The Ardèche river plateau has extensive standing stones (mainly dolmens and some menhirs), erected thousands of years ago. The river has one of Europe&#x27;s largest canyons, and the caves that dot the cliffs—which go as high as 300 metres (1,000 feet)—are known for signs of prehistoric inhabitants (arrowheads and flint knives are often found).

The Vivarais, as the Ardèche is still called, takes its name and coat of arms from Viviers, which was the capital of the Gaulish tribe of Helvii, part of Gallia Narbonensis, after the destruction of their previous capital at Alba-la-Romaine. Saint Andéol, a disciple of Polycarp, is supposed to have evangelized the Vivarais during the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus, and was supposedly martyred in 208. Legend tells of Andéol&#x27;s burial by Amycia Eucheria Tullia. In 430, Auxonius transferred the see to Viviers as a result of the problems suffered at its previous site in Alba Augusta.

===Medieval history===
The Vivarais area suffered greatly in the 9th century with raids by Hungarians and Saracen slavers operating from the coast of Provence resulting in an overall depopulation of the region.

In the early 10th century, economic recovery saw the building of many Romanesque churches in the region, including Ailhon, Mercuer, Saint Julien du Serre, Balazuc, Niègles, and Rochecolombe. The medieval county of Viviers or Vivarais at this time was administratively a part of the Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles, formed in 933 by Rudolph II of Burgundy&#x27;s fusion of Provence and Burgundy and bequeathed by its last monarch Rudolph III of Burgundy to the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II in 1032. Locally throughout this period, the Church played an important role. John II (Giovanni of Siena), Cardinal and Bishop of Viviers (1073–1095), accompanied Pope Urban II to the Council of Clermont.
It was later held in fief by the Counts of Toulouse, who lost it to the French crown in 1229. In 1284, with the Cistercian Abbey of Marzan, Philip IV established Villeneuve de Berg, and by the treaty of 10 July 1305 Philip IV of France obliged the bishops of Vivarais to admit the sovereignty of the kings of France over all their temporal domain. The realm was largely ignored by the Emperors and was finally granted to France as part of the domain of the Dauphin, the future Charles VII of Valois in 1308. During this period, the Maillard family, as Counts of Tournon, were influential in the Ardèche. During the Hundred Years War, the area maintained its loyalty to the French crown despite frequent attacks from the west.

===Early modern history===
As a result of the reformation of John Calvin in Geneva, the Vivarais Ardèche was one of the areas that strongly embraced Protestantism partly as a result of Jacques Valery&#x27;s missionary activity in 1534. During the Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the Ardèche was considered a strategically important location between Protestant Geneva, Lyon, and Catholic Languedoc. The region had prospered with the introduction of tobacco growing from America, and the agrarian experiments of Olivier de Serres, father of modern French agriculture. The influence of Protestant Lyon, and the growth of the silk industry, thanks to the planting of mulberry trees, gave the burghers of the Vivarais towns a certain independence of thinking, and with the support of powerful Protestant Huguenots (the Comte de Crussol and Olivier de Serres), the Vivarais became a Protestant stronghold. As a result, it suffered many attacks and eight pitched battles between 1562 and 1595. In 1598, the Edict of Nantes put an end to these struggles. At that time, the Vivarais had over 75 Protestant churches and five fortified strongholds with permanent garrisons. But the area&#x27;s problems were not over. In 1629, Paule de Chambaud, daughter of the Huguenot lord of Privas, chose instead to marry a Catholic, the Vicomte de l&#x27;Estrange, who supported Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s persecution of Protestants. With a majority of the population Protestant, Privas refused to submit, and as a centre of the revolt of the Benjamin de Rohan, duc de Soubise, was burned to the ground by the forces of Louis XIII, sent to support the Vicomte de l&#x27;Estrange. As a result, one-fifth of the Vivarais Protestant population emigrated.
The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which outlawed Protestantism, led the peasant family of Marie and Pierre Durand to revolt against royal authority. This led to the Camisard revolt of the Ardèche prophets. Louis XIV responded by dispatching Dragoons, who brutalised the population by &quot;dragonnades&quot;, destroying a number of communities. The brutality of those years was enormous and peace was restored only in 1715. As a result of brutality on both sides, another 50,000 Archèche Protestants fled France, many for Switzerland, whilst others were forced into abjuration (conversion).

In the next century, despite the growth of the community of Annonay, increasing polarisation between the upper nobility families such as Rohan Soubise, and Vogue, Count of Aubenas, possessing huge financial fortunes, and the lesser nobility, the village clergy and the bourgeoisie of the Vivarais paralleled developments elsewhere in France. Despite this, the sons of a local Annonay paper-maker, Joseph and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier, ascended in the first hot air balloon over the town on 4 June 1783. The firm of Canson Mongolfier continues making paper to this day and every year on the first weekend in June a large hot air balloon gathering celebrates the first journey. At the 200th anniversary in 1983, some 50 hot air balloons took part with the first historic flight reenacted with people dressed in period costume.

===Later modern history===
At the beginning of the French Revolution, the 1789 Declaration of Human Rights at last recognised Ardèche Protestants as citizens in their own right, free at last to practise their faith. Catholicism nonetheless continued to expand, and by the early 19th century the Ardèche included only 34,000 Protestants out of a population of 290,000. Named after the river of the same name, the Ardèche was one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. The support of Count François Antoine de Boissy d&#x27;Anglas representing the Third Estate of the Vivarais in the States General, the freeing of the serfs, and the support of the lesser clergy of the church ensured that the Ardèchois supported the early revolution, but they withdrew support when things became more radical. During the Reign of Terror, in 1794, the guillotine at Privas was kept busy with the execution of the former moderate supporters of the revolution. Under the Directory, bands of Chouans took to the Cevennes to escape and support former émigrés.
In the Napoleonic period, the Ardèche entered a period of increasingly prosperous inconspicuousness. After a period of eclipse, Viviers was reestablished in 1822 as the site of the see of the bishops of Ardèche, where it remains to this day. During the 19th century, modest economic growth took place. The population grew from 273,000 in 1793 to 388,500 in 1861. The silkworm industry boomed until 1855, when disease affected the worms and competition with China undermined the industry&#x27;s profitability. Mining at Privas saw the exploitation of local iron ore, which was quickly depleted. As a result, six blast furnaces were established, but they were only moderately profitable, the last closing at Pouzain in 1929.

The scientific pioneer Marc Seguin, whose inventions played a key role in the development of early locomotives, was born in the department. But Seguin located his business upstream, near Lyon, and industrial development in the Ardèche remained relatively small-scale. No large towns appeared in the department during the years of France&#x27;s industrialisation, and its official population total of 388,500, reached in 1861, turned out to be a peak that has not since been matched. Since the 1860s, the Ardèche economy has been split between the prosperous Rhône valley and the relatively poor and mountainous Haut Vivarais on the department&#x27;s western side. Sheep farming did not lead to the prosperity hoped for and wine growing, badly hit by the phylloxera crisis during the last decades of the 19th century, has had to compete with other more established areas of France.

== Geography ==


The department, corresponding to the ancient province of Vivarais, is part of the current region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and is surrounded by the departments of Drôme, Vaucluse, Gard, Lozère, Haute-Loire, Loire and Isère. It is a land of great contrasts: at the lowest it is at a mere 40 metres of elevation above sea level at the point at which the Ardèche river flows into the Rhône (in the southeast of the department) up to 1,754 metres at Mont Mézenc (centre-west), it is bordered to the east by the length of the Rhône valley for 140 km and to the west by the high plateaus of the Massif Central.

At its widest, the department does not exceed 75 km. It covers an area of 5,550 square kilometres, a size that hides its great diversity in terms of relief, the absence of access to rapid transport (unique in France), and the difficulties in transport from one part of the Ardeche to another, especially in winter. Privas shares this inaccessibility, being by road 589 km from Paris, 574 km from Strasbourg, 215 km from Marseille, 211 km from Annecy, 162 km from Chambéry, 147 km from Nîmes, 140 km from Lyon, 135 km from Grenoble, and 127 km from Saint-Étienne.

===Differing natural regions===

There are five natural regions of the Ardèche:

*The mountains
They border the western frontier of the department with an average altitude of 1,100 metres. They are of largely granitic composition, split by the Velay Basalts of the Massif of Mézenc, and the Forez mountains, centred upon volcanic cones of ash, lava plugs and numerous magma flows (Mézenc: 1,754 metres; Gerbier de Jonc: 1,551 m). Their inclination slopes gently westward, leading to a westerly flow of water to the Atlantic. Here the Loire has its source. Within a few kilometres is the volcanic lake of Issarlès (92 ha, 5 km in circumference, 108 m in depth). The climate is extreme: snow for many months, very violent winds in autumn and winter (known locally as &quot;la burle&quot;), frequent fogs in the valleys, extreme temperature changes between the seasons, with heavy rains (1,500 mm per year in average) concentrated in September and October.

*The plateaus of the Haut-Vivarais and the Cévennes

The transition zone descending from the mountains (1,200 m) to the valley of the Rhône (300 to 400 m), is the plateau region. The plateau&#x27;s medium altitude is one of green forested crests separated by wild and uncrossable gorges. Hydrographic resources are dominated by these torrential streams and rainfall is characterised by frequent summer showers, with the climate much less extreme than that of the mountains to the west.
*The Bas-Vivarais
The Ardèche river flows into the Rhône, following a generally southeasterly course. This Karst region is formed of calcareous limestones, where the streams flow in steep-sided valleys separated by sharp crests. With a generally low altitude the Bas-Vivarais enjoys a warm, dry, almost Mediterranean climate. Skies are wide and bright, temperatures more elevated (3 or 4 °C in January). The winds from the northeast are dominant, but those of the south (known as the &quot;vent du midi&quot;) and west are full of humidity, bringing heavy precipitation for a few days at a time. The few rivers, the Lavezon, Escoutay, and Frayol, provide less of a hydrological resource than one sees in the crysaline granitic areas to the north. This is a country of wine, shrubland, cereals, and extensive fruit trees (this is the region of Aubenas and of Joyeuse).

*The plateau of the Coirons

This plateau, 800 metres above sea level, is completely surrounded to the north by the valleys of the Ouvèze and the Payre, to the south by the valley of the Escoutay, and to the west by the Col of the Escrinet and the valley of Vesseaux. It is built of basalt that extends in length 18 km in the direction of the Rhône, and at its widest is a maximum 11 km. The climate here is also fairly extreme: snow, without being thick, is frequent, variations of temperature accentuated by the strong, cold winds. The soil is rich and fertile. Farming is dominated by wheat, oats, and potatoes, with the raising of goats and cattle. On the slopes are vines and fruit trees.
*The valley of the Rhône
The Rhône corridor is very straight on the right bank, which runs almost at the foot of the Vivarais plateaus, leaving tiny plains where the rivers from the Vivarais descend to the Rhône. Here the strong north wind (the mistral) dominates, but temperatures are moderated by the influence of the &quot;Midi&quot; to the south. The narrow plains are very fertile and favourable to orchards (peaches and apricots). On the slopes the vines dominate.

Maps of different types of agricultural products translate clearly into these five regions. According to A. Siegfried, &quot;The true character of the Ardèche is of a slope turning towards the Mediterranean, open to the influences coming from the Midi. These influences climb the length of the valleys to the summit of the high plateau, which resists their passage, not letting them penetrate. The high and the low are thus opposed, such is the character of the Ardèche personality.&quot;

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Annonay; the prefecture Privas is the sixth-most populous. As of 2019, there are 8 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Ardèche===
Ardèche is divided into three arrondissements. The President of the Departmental Council has been Olivier Amrane of The Republicans (LR) since 2021.

===Representation===
====National Assembly====

The department elected three members of the National Assembly in the 2017 legislative election:

====Senate====
Representing Ardèche in the Senate are Michel Teston and Yves Chastan.

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1791:

The department&#x27;s inhabitants are called &quot;Ardéchois&quot;. As one of the poorer districts in France, emigration from the Ardèche exceeded immigration for a long time, although this has recently changed. In 1990, Ardèche reached the population level it had 50 years earlier. Today, the population numbers 309,000 (compared to 390,000 in 1860). Despite this demographic recovery, the area remains marked by a rural exodus that minimises the effects of an above average birth rate. The rate of natural increase is practically nonexistent, as Ardèche-born inhabitants have an above average median age and thus also an above average death rate.

Ardèche has few foreign-born immigrants, found almost exclusively in the tourist locations of Largentière, Le Pouzin, and Bourg-Saint-Andéol. They number about 11,000, 4% of the population. During the summer, many European tourists visit the Ardèche, principally Dutch and Germans staying at camping sites.

Some 50% of the population of the department lives in rural communities, compared to a national average of 75% of the French population living in urban areas. The Ardèche has an average population density of 52 per km2, compared to 122 per km2 for the Rhône-Alpes region and 104 per km2 in France. Population density is highest in the regions around the two towns of Annonay and Aubenas and along the edge of the Rhône valley. The mountainous areas are much less densely populated, with only 6 to 7 inhabitants per km2 in the cantons of Saint-Étienne-de-Lugdarès and Valgorge. As the mountains and the plateau continue to depopulate, those of the Rhône valley, Bas-Vivarais and lower Ardèche are continuing to grow, but the population situation, whilst better than in the past, still remains an issue for the region.

The Rhône valley and the Annonay region, close to the main axes of communication (highways and the TGV railway), are the department&#x27;s most urbanised areas. Here the natural growth in population is everywhere positive. Annonay, Tournon-sur-Rhône, and Guilherand-Granges benefit from the proximity of the nearby town of Valence and the economically more advanced department of la Drôme. In the southern interior with the town of Aubenas and the valley of the Ardèche river, the population of the cantons of Villeneuve-de-Berg and of Vallon-Pont-d&#x27;Arc grows at four times the speed of the departmental average.

The high plateau and the mountainous areas as far as Privas continue to lose its young population (the median age of the population as a whole is increasing as a result of the weakness of the power of this region to attract new permanent inhabitants).

== Culture ==

With its rivers and streams, Ardèche has become a favorite place for canoe and kayak enthusiasts from around the world. The Ardèche contains part of Cévennes National Park. The area is well known for sport climbing, with many well-managed limestone and granite crags. Each year the Ardeche hosts one of France&#x27;s biggest road cycling events, L&#x27;Ardéchoise, with 16,000 entrants participating in 2011.

The Ardèche department is known for the speciality of Sweet Chestnuts, with the famous &quot;châtaigne d&#x27;Ardèche&quot; granted the appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC) in 2006. The cuisine of Ardèche is very similar to that of Corsica, with liberal use of chestnuts.

<text>Agassou (also Ati-A-Sou) is a loa who guards the old traditions of Dahomey in the West African Vodun religion and the rada loa of Haitian Vodou.
==Agassou: Royal Leopard King of Africa==
Agassou is the product of a divine mating—his mother was princess Aligbonu and is said to have mated with a leopard, giving birth to Agassou. Agassou is further noted as ruler and king of a particular sect in Africa that has come to be known as the Agasuvi (children of Agasu). In an act of incest with his mother, he had three sons. Their lineage, their royal regalia, and their legacy are still held by the Agasuvi of West Africa. In that society, the men take their lineage from the clan of Agassou. His shield and his spear are still guarded today—gifts that are said to have been given to him by his angelic father. In the kingdom of Dahomey he is honored as their tohuio (ancestral spirit) along with his mother, Aligbonu. Together they form a dyad that serves as the creation story for Dahomean lineage.

Agassou is then the first human who can be traced back to see how he ascended to the status of loa. In the Priyere, he is called &quot;Houngan Agassou de Bo Miwa&quot; in honor of his work as both a priest/king and a magician. His spears and shield are still in ancient Dahomey which is Benin today.

In rada, he&#x27;s referred to as Ati-Agassou; in petro Hougan Agassou.

In African oral chant from Benin, Agassou is depicted as the chosen one sent to Haiti by Ayida Wedo to bring the practice to her African children to ease their pain and sufferings from slavery. Agassou was given a crab for the journey.

His day is Thursday and his colors are brown and gold. Hougan (ou&#x27;k bon) meaning &quot;you are the righteous one&quot; or the mambo will invoke Agassou when money is needed in the temple; his specialty is making money out of cigarettes.

<doc id="90514" wikidata="Q399586" url="?curid=90514" title="Agwé">
<text>Agwé (also spelt Goue, Agoueh, or Agive) is a lwa who rules over the sea, fish, and aquatic plants, as well as the patron lwa of fishermen and sailors in Vodou, especially in Haiti. He is believed to live on an underwater island and be married to Erzulie Freda and La Sirene. He goes by several titles, including &quot;koki la me&quot; (&quot;Shell of the Sea&quot;), &quot;koki dore&quot; (&quot;Golden Shell&quot;), &quot;The Angel in the Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Eel&quot;, and &quot;The Tadpole in the Pond&quot;.

==Agwe Family==
===Rada===
Met Agwe is the lwa of direction. His territory is the winds and the currents, waves and depths of the oceans. He helps sailors find their bearings when lost at sea. He provides inspiration and guidance whenever an individual needs them in times of turmoil, loss, or indecision. He lives in a glorious palace under the seas. Patron of sailors, sea travelers, and pirates.
(&quot;Master Agwe&quot;)

Agwe Arroyo or Agwe Tawoyo/Agwe &#x27;Woyo (&quot;Agwe of the Streams&quot;) is captain of &quot;Immamou&quot;, the ship that carries the dead to Guinee, the afterlife. He cries salt-water tears for the departed. He assisted the souls of those that suffered crimes against humanity during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

Papa Agwe is envisioned as a handsome African man with green eyes, sometimes lighter skin, often wearing a naval officer&#x27;s or sailor&#x27;s uniform. He is considered to be a gentleman who commands respect and embodies several ideals of masculinity including bravery, reserve, and provision.

===Petro===
Agwe Flambeau (&quot;Agwe of the Torch&quot;) is from a realm of boiling water, like a hot springs or an underwater volcanic eruption. He is appealed to give rivals bad luck in fishing or sailing. He is also invoked to avoid or remove bad luck at sea, to avoid sinking or drowning, or to stop or prevent rough seas and bad storms.

Agwe Ge-Rouge (&quot;Agwe of the Red Eyes&quot;)

==Worship==
His colors are blue, white, and occasionally sea-green or brown. His &quot;veve&quot; (ritual symbol) is a boat with sails. His symbols are painted shells, painted oars, and sea life like the seahorse and starfish. He is syncretized with the Catholic saint Ulrich of Augsburg and occasionally the archangel Raphael, both of whom are depicted holding fish. His holy day is Thursday.

He is saluted or signaled with blowing on a conch shell and/or volleys of gunfire. When he possesses a devotee he often pushes himself around the temple on a chair (his boat) with a cane (his oar), shouting naval commands and saluting members of the congregation. His &quot;chwal&quot; (&quot;horses&quot; or spiritually mounted devotees) need to be kept moist with wet sponges or damp towels and have to be kept from running into the sea, where Agwe belongs.

===Offerings===
Small offerings to Agwe are poured or dropped overboard in deep ocean water. Large offerings to Agwe are left on constructed rafts (&quot;barques d&#x27;Agwe&quot;) which are floated or towed out to sea. If the raft sinks, it is accepted; if it returns to shore it is rejected. After the offering is left, the supplicants cannot look back at that place or it will anger Agwe. &quot;Chwal&quot; must be prevented from falling or leaping into the sea and drowning, as it would offend Agwe. Nothing toxic (lead pipes, cement bags, garbage) must be used to weigh down the raft; if it will hurt or pollute the sea, it will anger Agwe.

His offerings include: 
*Beverages: champagne, naval rum, or anisette. Coffee with sugar and cream.
*Items: mirrors, a telescope, toy ships or scale ship models, oars or paddles, sea shells, turquoise beads or jewelry, fish-shaped sculptures or jewelry, fish hooks and nets, nautical uniforms or medals. 
*Food: Savory exotic foods, melon, boiled cornmeal, rice cooked in coconut milk, rice cooked with lima beans, boiled or fried ripe bananas, white cake, cane syrup, almond oil, olive oil. 
*Sacrificial Animals: White roosters, male ducks, and white rams or goats whose wool has been dyed with indigo. They are afterwards prepared, cooked, and then placed in serving dishes or on plates as a sacrifice (as king of the seas, he doesn&#x27;t get hot food at home).

He is rarely offered seafood. If it is offered (perhaps to celebrate a bountiful year, good fortune, or a joyous occasion) it must be prepared and then cooked in a pan or oven. Then (to be fit for the table of the king of the sea) it must be served on a white china dish with blue patterns.

<text>Ariège (; ) is a department in southwestern France, located in the region of Occitanie. It is named after the river Ariège and its capital is Foix. Ariège is known for its rural landscape, with a population of 153,287 as of 2019. Its INSEE and postal code is 09, hence the department&#x27;s informal name of &quot;le zéro neuf&quot;. The inhabitants of the department are known as &quot;Ariègeois&quot; or &quot;Ariègeoises&quot;.

== Geography ==

The department is part of the current region of Occitanie. 
It borders Haute-Garonne to the west and north, Aude to the east, Pyrénées-Orientales to the south-east. To the south it borders Andorra and the Spanish Province of Lleida.
Covering an area of 4,890 km2, the department is divided into three arrondissements: Foix, Pamiers, and Saint-Girons.
It comprises 13 cantons, 21 intercommunalities, and 325 communes. In 2009 the Regional Natural Park of the Ariège Pyrenees was created covering about 40% of the area of the department of Ariège.

===Natural regions===
There are three main areas:

;The Ariège plain
The north of the department consists of plains, hills and low valleys where agriculture is prevalent. Part of Lauragais covers the northeast of the department. Two major rivers, the Ariège and the Lèze traverse the plain from south to north. A landscape of grain fields dominates the scene with growing of sweetcorn and sunflowers and with prairies.

;The Pyrenean foothills
This area includes the Plantaurel mountains and the Pre-Pyrenean hills below 1000 m. Various geological structures are present in contrast: the Foix Valley with its granite mountain landscape and the Lavelanet region with marl and limestone.

;Ariège high country
The geography is dominated by the Pyrenees mountains exceeding 1,000 m above sea level which form the border between France and Spain. The &quot;Pica d&#x27;Estats&quot; (3143 m), the &quot;Pic de Montcalm&quot; (3077 m), and &quot;Pic de Sotllo&quot; (3072 m) are the highest points of the department. These peaks are clearly visible from Toulouse in the Haute Garonne.

The landscape is dominated by forests with coniferous species coexist with hardwoods such as chestnut trees, Black Locust trees, ash trees, and beech trees.

There are hundreds of kilometres of well-marked paths which allow exploration of the magnificent Pyrenees mountains. The high mountains are easily accessible via good roads, cable cars or by foot. There are a number of lodges providing high level mountain accommodation that are comfortable, warm and with good meals. There are also a number of fresh water lakes which provide a variety of activities including, walking, swimming, fishing, canoeing, sailboarding and picnicking.

There are several downhill ski resorts, the three largest being Ax-Bonascre, Les Monts D&#x27;Olmes and Guzet-Neige. There are many cross country ski-ing resorts, one of the best being at Plateau de Beille, near Les Cabannes. Ariège is one of the least populated and most unspoiled regions of France. The locals enjoy keeping traditions alive, especially old farming techniques. Consequently, as fewer insecticides, for example, have been used, the flora and fauna of the area continue to be rich in both diversity and numbers. Butterflies are common and birds are numerous; particularly noticeable are large birds of prey, including the magnificent Griffon vultures.

There are also many unspoiled villages and hamlets tucked away in the valleys close to the department&#x27;s border with Spain – Seix, Cominac, and Aulus-les-Bains are examples – together with picturesque mountain villages, most notably Aleu which comes alive in the holiday season.

==Climate==
Ariège stands on the eastern limit of oceanic dominance over rainfall, but other influences are felt:

* Mediterranean – particularly visible in the vegetation of the foothills and of the valley of the Ariège river towards Tarascon, and in the Sault country
* Continental – in the Pyrenean valleys, with many storms and big differences of temperature between day and night

There is no great tendency to summer drought, as the flow of air from the north-west brings rain throughout the year. Rainfall is moderate on the foothills and in some sheltered valleys, measuring 700 to 1,000 mm per year, but increases significantly in the higher valleys with levels between 1,000 mm and 1,800 mm. The slopes exposed to the north-west, such as Aulus and Orlu, are, as one would expect, the wettest, together with the frontal ridges that meet air flow from the southwest (giving rise to the Foehn effect). Snow cover is common over 1,000 metres, lasting several months above 1,500 to 2,000 metres. Some periglacial areas exist over 2,500 m but the only true glacier in Ariège is that of Mont Valier, near Castillon-en-Couserans.

Temperatures are mild in the foothills, most notably at the city of Foix (400 metres) the average is 5 °C in January and 19 °C in July. However, they decline rapidly with elevation, e.g. at l&#x27;Hospitalet-près-l&#x27;Andorre (1,430 m) it is 0 °C in January and 14 °C in July.

==History==

Ariège is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 under the Act of 22 December 1789. It was created from the counties of Foix (Languedoc) and Couserans (Gascogne).

A request was made to the Council of State to rename the department Ariège-Pyrénées. According to the proponents of this project, the word &quot;Pyrenees&quot; would better position the department to promote itself throughout France. The demand was rejected.

Foix is the administrative capital of the Ariège. It is an ancient medieval town with a fortress, Chateau de Foix, perched on a hill overlooking it. The fortress has been attacked many times without being captured including an attempt by Simon de Montfort. It has also been used as a prison, and the names of English prisoners of war can still be seen on the cell walls. Another famous castle in the Ariège is Montségur, located on a rocky outcrop at a height of 1200 metres. During the Albigensian Crusade and siege in 1244 the castle was largely destroyed, with more than two hundred Cathar priests burnt at the stake as heretics. The castle was gradually rebuilt by Royalists over the next three hundred years.

The start of the seventeenth century saw the area ravaged by the Huguenot rebellions of Protestants against Catholics. In 1621 the Huguenot forces ruined the church at La Tour-du-Crieu. In 1629 Pamiers was sacked by Henry of Condé following uprisings that left several hundred dead in the city. This was also the period during which the abbeys at Foix, Tarascon-sur-Ariège, Saint-Girons, Saverdun and Le Mas-d&#x27;Azil were torched and destroyed.

The nineteenth century was a time of strong industrial growth, supported in Ariège by an abundant supply of water power. The department also benefited from its significant reserves of iron ore. The growth of iron-based industries was a feature of the period with the establishment, in 1817, of a steel manufacturing plant at Pamiers. This has been the principal driver of the local economy ever since. Other representative examples of the iron-based industries that developed in Ariège during the nineteenth century include the forges at Montgaillard and the blast furnaces at Tarascon-sur-Ariège.

An additional part of the department&#x27;s industrial development during the nineteenth century was the paper industry at Saint-Girons and the textile industry in the Pays d&#x27;Olmes. Changes in forest laws in 1829 resulted in the War of the Maidens, a revolt by peasants who resisted losing their rights to use the forests. They disguised themselves as women while performing acts of rebellion.

Towns of particular historical interest in the department include Pamiers, which hosted a large commercial centre and three churches; Mirepoix, a medieval town; and Saint-Lizier, which is situated on a hilltop with winding streets, fine views, and a church with cloisters that are noteworthy. Saint-Girons is an agricultural centre with a Saturday market.

=== Heraldry ===
=== Anthem of Ariège ===
The patriotic song &quot;Arièjo O moun Pais&quot; was written by Father Sabas Maury, born on 1 March 1863 in Gestiès in the valley of Siguer. He was the pastor of Miglos and Varilhes. It became the anthem for Ariège.

== Economy ==
The Ariège department is a largely unknown department which is situated next to Aude in the southwestern part of the Occitanie region. It shares its borders with Aude, Andorra, Haute-Garonne and Pyrénées-Orientales.

It is predominantly a farming area, as the soil is rich and fertile. More than 50% of Ariège is mountainous, with 490,965 hectares being covered by forests.


In the Ax valleys, the mining of talc is the most typical activity. The processing plant for talc at Luzenac is supplied by &quot;Carrière de talc de Trimouns,&quot; which is the largest producer in the region (400,000 tonnes per year).

This industry is supplemented by tourism. Winter sports resorts are located at Ax 3 Domaines, Ascou-Pailhères, Plateau de Beille, Le Chioula, and Goulier Neige.

In the Lavelanet area, the textile industry used to be significant, but much of the industry has moved out of the country and offshore. A few companies have tried to persist in the face of competition from lower cost-labor in Eastern Europe and Asia. New craftspeople installed themselves in the abandoned factories, like the brewery Le Grand Bison, now active for several years and counting gold and silver rewards for their beers.

In the Pamiers area metallurgy, aeronautics, and chemistry are the main industries. Metallurgy, at the Aubert &amp; Duval factory, produces forgings for the aerospace and energy industries. Several companies are in the aeronautics outsourcing industry, such as &quot;Recaero&quot; and &quot;Maz&#x27;Air&quot;, partners with aircraft manufacturers. Chemistry is represented by the paint industry with the &quot;Alliance Maestria&quot;, which includes several companies making paint for anything from buildings to aircraft. In the same sector, &quot;Etienne Lacroix&quot; in the commune of Mazères, mainly manufactures fireworks and pyrotechnics.

For the Saint-Girons area, industry is in decline. It is represented mainly by the production of paper.

Hydroelectric production from Ariège is about one-fifth of Pyrenean production. The hydroelectric plant at Aston has the largest annual production capacity in the Pyrenees (392 million kWh). With Orlu and &quot;L&#x27;Hospitalet-près-l&#x27;Andorre&quot;, these three plants have the largest capacity in the department. The hydroelectric developments in Ariège can support a city of 600,000 inhabitants. Large industrial plants use the energy produced together with the natural gas from Lacq.

The Ariège Chamber of Commerce and Industry is situated at Foix. The department&#x27;s Economic Development Agency (&quot;Ariège Expansion&quot;) is at Verniolle. The department has established three &#x27;business incubators&#x27; to support enterprise in Ariège.

== Transportation==
Mostly mountainous and rural, the department of Ariège is far from the main transport routes serving the main valleys and coastlines. The railway arrived in the department in 1861 with the Toulouse to Puigcerda line which is the only line that remains open to this day in the department. Besides the trains of the TER Occitanie, this route is still served by Intercity trains from Paris-Austerlitz.

Since 2002 Ariège has been connected to the national motorway network via the A66 autoroute which joins the A61 autoroute at Villefranche-de-Lauragais and continues south of Pamiers by the National Route NR20 as a dual carriageway as far as Tarascon-sur-Ariège.

== Demographics ==
The department has 153,287 inhabitants (2019). The populations of the arrondissements are (2019):
* Arrondissement of Foix – 47,433
* Arrondissement of Pamiers – 64,972
* Arrondissement of Saint-Girons – 40,882

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Pamiers; the prefecture Foix is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 10 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

The main urban areas are those of Pamiers, Foix and Saint-Girons.

=== Housing ===
According to INSEE 24.7% of available housing in Ariège consisted of secondary residences. The following table indicates the main communes in Ariège (population more than 1,000) where second homes or occasional residences comprise more than 10% of total housing.

Communes with more than 10% Secondary Residences (2017)
== Politics ==
The department has two parliamentary constituencies and 13 cantons. In general it can be said that:
&quot;With a republican and secular tradition since the Third Republic, Ariège is firmly held by the Socialist Party (PS) even though in recent years the right has managed to sink a few corners of the fortress&quot;.

This resulted in a parliamentary representation until 2017 was dominated by the PS and a General Council where 19 of the 22 members were PS or close to this party – the political orientation of the department is therefore clearly identified. In 2007 it was the department with the most votes for Ségolène Royal (59.56%). In 2012 it had the third most voters for François Hollande in France with 64.69% after Corrèze and Seine Saint-Denis.

Although male/female parity is well respected by MPs (Mrs. Frédérique Massat and Mr. Alain Fauré), all 22 councillors were men until 2011 when two women were elected.

The President of the Departmental Council is Christine Tequi of the Socialist Party.

== Culture ==
The region was originally part of Aquitaine and has retained many hallmarks of the Gascon culture and Gascon language.

=== Gastronomy ===
The gastronomy of Ariège is based on the cooking of Pyrenean regional food, such as cheese or charcuterie from the mountain country. Azinat is the local and typical dish of Ariège. The department is also well advanced in the field of organic farming.

<text>Ayida-Weddo, also known as Ayida, Agida, Ayida-Wedo, Aido Quedo, Aido Wedo, Aida Wedo, and Aido Hwedo, is a powerful loa spirit in Vodou, revered in regions across Africa and the Caribbean, namely in Benin, Suriname and Haiti. Known as the &quot;Rainbow Serpent&quot;, Ayida-Weddo is the loa of fertility, rainbows, wind, water, fire, wealth, thunder, and snakes. Alongside Damballa, Ayida-Weddo is regarded among the most ancient and significant loa. Considered in many sources as the female half of Damballa&#x27;s twin spirit, the names Da Ayida Hwedo, Dan Ayida Hwedo, and Dan Aida Wedo have also been used to refer to her. Thought to have existed before the Earth, Ayida-Weddo assisted the creator goddess Mawu-Lisa in the formation of the world, and is responsible for holding together the Earth and heavens. Ayida-Weddo bestows love and well-being upon her followers, teaching fluidity and the connection between body and spirit.

==Family==
Ayida-Weddo is a member of the Rada family of loa, associated with protection, benevolence, and love. In many stories, she is married to Damballa. As his inseparable companion, she shares him with his concubine, Erzulie Freda. In others, she is one with Damballa: a single entity sharing a dual spirit. As his female aspect, together they represent dynamism, life, creation, and the intertwined harmony of male and female, earth and heaven, and body and spirit.

==Symbols and offerings==
Ayida-Weddo is symbolized by the rainbow, snake, thunderbolt, and white paquet congo. When represented in art, she is often depicted as a serpent consuming its own tail. In veves, she is invariably portrayed alongside Damballa as one of two dancing or intertwined serpents. White, as the purest color, represents her in ceremony. When Ayida-Weddo appears in ritual, she dons white cloth and a jeweled headdress, and embodies the serpent by slithering upon the ground. Matching her sacred color, appropriate offerings to her include white chickens, white eggs, rice, milk, as well as other white offerings decorated in rainbow colors. Her favorite plant is cotton.

==Form and function==
The Fon people of Benin believe the rainbow serpent Ayida-Weddo was a servant of Mawu-Lisa and existed before the Earth was made. As Mawu-Lisa created the world, the serpent carried the goddess in its mouth as she shaped the Earth with her creations. As they went across the land, the rainbow serpent&#x27;s body left behind the canyons, rivers, valleys, and mountains. The rainbow serpent had a twin personality whose red half was male, and whose blue half was female. Together, they held up the Earth and the heavens. The female half was said to arc thunderbolts and rainbows across the sky with its body, and lived among the clouds, trees, springs, and rivers. Asked by Mawu-Lisa to help support the weight of her creations on the Earth, the rainbow serpent&#x27;s male half coiled its body underneath the world to prevent its collapse. As it writhes from exertion under the world&#x27;s weight, the serpent causes earthquakes in the land. When it runs out of the iron that sates its hunger, it is said the serpent will devour its tail, finally causing the heavy Earth to sink into the abyss. In some stories, Ayida-Weddo descends from the heavens with Adanhu and Yewa, the first humans created by Mawu.

&quot;In the beginning there was a vast serpent, whose body formed seven thousand coils beneath the earth, protecting it from descent into the abysmal sea. Then the titanic snake began to move and heave its massive form from the earth to envelop the sky. It scattered stars in the firmament and wound its taught flesh down the mountains to create riverbeds. It shot thunderbolts to the earth to create the sacred thunderstones. From its deepest core it released the sacred waters to fill the earth with life. As the first rains fell, a rainbow encompassed the sky and Danbala took her, Ayida Wedo, as his wife. The spiritual nectar that they created reproduces through all men and women as milk and semen. The serpent and the rainbow taught humankind the link between blood and life, between menstruation and birth, and the ultimate Vodou sacrament of blood sacrifice.&quot;

In Haiti, Ayida-Weddo is said to have crossed the ocean with her husband Damballa to take the ancient knowledge and traditions of Vodou from Africa to the Caribbean. As Damballa slithered under the ocean, Ayida-Weddo flew across the sky in the form of the rainbow until the two loa reunited in Haiti, bringing Vodou to the Americas.

Ayida-Weddo is syncretized in Haitian Vodou with the Catholic figure of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception for her association with serpents and rainbow-colored cherubs. Ayida-Weddo&#x27;s days of service lie on Monday and Tuesday, and she is honored on December 8 with festivals for her blessings. Through prayer and ritual, she grants peace, love, prosperity, joy, and understanding to her devotees.

In West African mythology, Ayida-Weddo is often equated to the Yoruba rainbow serpent Oshumare, with whom she shares many aspects.

<text>Cantal (; or ) is a rural department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France, with its prefecture in Aurillac. Its other principal towns are Saint-Flour (the episcopal see) and Mauriac; its residents are known as Cantalians ( or &quot;&quot;). Cantal borders the departments of Puy-de-Dôme, Haute-Loire, Aveyron, Lot, Lozère and Corrèze, in the Massif Central natural region.

Along with neighbouring Lozère and Creuse, Cantal is among the most sparsely populated and geographically isolated departments of France and Aurillac is the departmental capital farthest removed from a major motorway. It had a population of 144,692 in 2019, making it the country&#x27;s 98th most populated department. Of the 96 metropolitan departments, it is the fifth least populated.

== Etymology ==
The department is named for the Plomb du Cantal, the central peak of the bare and rugged mounts of Cantal (French: &quot;Monts du Cantal&quot;) mountain chain which traverses the area.

== Geography ==

Cantal lies in the middle of France&#x27;s central plateau. The Cantal range is a group of extinct and eroded volcanic peaks. Its highest point is the Plomb du Cantal, which reaches an elevation of . Its neighbors are Puy Mary (elev. ) and Puy Chavaroche (elev. ). To their north lie the &#x27; and Dore ranges and the arid Artense Plateau. Immediately to their east is the fertile Planèze Plateau, bound on its east by the &#x27;.

The principal rivers are the Alagnon, which is a tributary to the Allier; the Celle and Truyère, tributary to the Lot; and the Cère and Rhue, tributary to the Dordogne. At an elevation of above sea level, the low point of the province lies in the Lot valley. The Truyère valley skirts the Planèze on the south and divides it from the &quot;, whose foothills include the thermal springs of Chaudes-Aigues. The western area of the department consists of grassy plateaus and river valleys.

At first, Cantal was divided into four arrondissements—Aurillac, Mauriac, Saint-Flour and Murat (later merged with Saint-Flour).

=== Climate ===
The climate of the department varies considerably. Prevailing winds and mountain ranges divide Cantal into four climatic zones:
* The west is subject to oceanic winds which bring rains.
* The Cantal and the Cézallier mountains create a rain shadow: it rains and snows quite often.
* The Planèze of Saint-Flour and the region of Massiac receive less precipitation, owing to winds coming from the north and south.
* The plateaus of the Margeride and the Aubrac have harsh winters and pleasant summers.
Generally, the weather is mild and dry in the alluvial plain between Murat and Saint-Flour and around Aurillac, while summer storms and winters can be long and severe in the northern and central areas. The west—nearer precipitation coming in from the Atlantic—is well watered. There is abundant snowfall which can remain up to six months on the mountaintops. Winter temperatures can fall to below , whereas in summer is often reached. The southern part of the department, on its borders with Aveyron and Lot, is the hottest region. Aurillac averaged 2080 hours of sunlight per year over the period from 1991 to 2000. Fog is rare and disappears quickly. Wind is usually not very strong, but the lightning flashes in this department are among the most spectacular in France.

Televised French weather forecasts often note Aurillac as the coldest city in France in the mornings. This status should be understood in light of their derivation from temperature readings by . Of the 30 cities included on its maps, Aurillac is by far the one with the highest altitude, at above sea level.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Aurillac, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

== History ==
The area of Cantal was historically part of the Haute-Auvergne (&quot;).

Cantal is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. Prior to the First World War, it comprised parts of the XIII. Army Corps military region and the Clermont-Ferrand educational division (&quot;).

=== Diocese of Cantal ===
After the 1790 Constitution Civile du Clergé, the Diocese of Saint-Flour in Cantal (whose bishop refused to swear the oath required by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, constituting a schism from Rome) was among the almost half of the French sees being abolished to realign the new bishoprics to coincide with the new departments, such as Cantal, where outsider parish priest Anne-Alexandre-Marie Thibault was elected Bishop. It was formally abolished in turn after the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 (Thibault refusing to resign), in favor of the reinstated bishopric of Saint Poul, but actually retained the departemental borders.

== Economy ==

The climate being generally too cool and damp for grain, much of Cantal is given over to pasture for Aubrac and Salers cattle, sheep, and, formerly, horses. This in turn supports a dairy industry responsible for butter and Roquefort cheese and the appellation-controlled cheeses Cantal, Salers, and Bleu d&#x27;Auvergne. Cantal is the French department with the greatest number of appellation-controlled cheeses, although proper Roquefort is now restricted to cheese produced in the Aveyron department. The region&#x27;s mineral products include coal, copper, lead, iron, antimony, granite, slate and lime, but the department&#x27;s isolation and poor infrastructure long precluded their exploitation. Before the First World War, the primary exports were livestock, cheese, butter, and coal and the main imports were coal, wine, grain, flour, and pottery. By then, it had been connected to both the Orleans and Midi railways.

Traditionally, many Cantalians roamed France during the year plying humble trades but now the area&#x27;s relative lack of industry and development permits tourism. An area has been set aside as the Auvergne Volcanos Regional Park (&quot;).

== Demographics ==
The Occitan language was historically spoken in Cantal.

The official population count for 2019 was 144,692. It peaked at 262,117 in 1836, and has been below 200,000 since the First World War. Like many of the country&#x27;s rural departments, Cantal experienced a marked decrease in population throughout the twentieth century as agricultural wages failed to keep pace with those available in the industrialising regions. The department falls within the band of low-density population known as the empty diagonal.

Population development since 1791:

===Architecture===

The department counts several remarkable buildings. Among them, the Romanesque religious buildings like the churches of Cheylade (eleventh century), Dieno or Massiac. The area&#x27;s Catholic cathedral—dependent on the archdiocese of Bourges—is the 15th-century St Pierre de St-Flour, erected in the Gothic style.

===Art===
The characteristic folk dance in Cantal is &quot;La Bourrée&quot;. In the countryside it would be danced in folk costumes with accompaniment by accordion. The dance form was long ago adapted for use in courtly music and features prominently in the Baroque dance suites of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

=== Cuisine ===

The traditional articles of Cantalian cuisine were rye, buckwheat, and chestnuts, as well as ham, cheese, and vegetables. The area&#x27;s simple recipes were designed to satisfy hill farmers and herders. Notable dishes include:

* Aligot (also in Aveyron): Creamed potatoes, cheese (fresh tomme), butter, fresh cream and a little garlic.
* Truffade: Potatoes in slices with cheese (fresh tomme) and a little garlic.
* Pounti: A cake made with dough of wheat black flour, herbs, lard, prunes and Swiss chard.
* The typical cheese &quot;Cantal&quot;, which can be chosen young, old or &quot;entre-deux&quot;.

===Outdoor activities===
In the 19th century, the hills and valleys abounded with game and the streams with fish, the countryside producing a &quot;vast variety&quot; of aromatic and medicinal plants.

At present, the most visited places are Puy Mary, the Plomb du Cantal, the village of Salers, and the gorges of the Truyère (with the Garabit viaduct, the castle of Alleuze, and the towns of Boisset, Pierrefort). The &quot;Parc Naturel des Volcans d’Auvergne&quot; features several inactive volcanoes. Cantal also has numerous castles. Puy Mary can be accessed by car easily. and is accessible to hikers. It is also possible to hike to the nearby Puy de Peyre-Arse (1806 m). Le Lioran or Super-Lioran are the best places to start the hike. Le Lioran is accessible by rail or bus and Super-Lioran is just a kilometre away from Le Lioran. From Super-Lioran it is also possible to hike to Plomb du Cantal. There is also an option of taking the cable car to Plomb du Cantal from Super-Lioran. Super-Lioran tourist office has various hike routes in the region. There are also various adventure courses, dirt bikes, summer luges etc. that run in Super-Lioran.

Among the various activities offered in this department, the &quot;Massif Cantalien&quot; can be discovered through walking, horseback riding or mountain biking excursions (tracks are especially designed for this). Aquatic sports are also common, due to numerous lakes. The department also offers activities such as mountaineering, canoeing and fishing. The landscape also allows the practice of free flight: base jumpers frequent the sector around the Puy Mary and the Brezon valley.

Thanks to its terrain, Cantal can count on a good snow level, which allows winter sports. The station of Le Lioran, largest ski-resort of the Massif Central offers alpine skiing (with specific adaptations for snowboard) and ice-skating. Excursions in snow shoes are also possible. The department has several hundred kilometres of cross-country skiing tracks.

==Politics==
This staunchly Catholic department is an old stronghold of the French Right and was the electoral base of the late Georges Pompidou. Only the area around Aurillac, historically anti-clerical and Radical, has some left-wing support.

The current president of the departmental council is Bruno Faure (The Republicans).

Paul Doumer, French president from May 1931 to May 1932, was born in Aurillac in this department.

<text>Corrèze (; ) is a département in France, named after the river Corrèze which runs through it. Although its prefecture is Tulle, its most populated city is Brive-la-Gaillarde. Corrèze is located in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, on the border with Occitania and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

In 2019, Corrèze had a population of 240,073, divided among 279 communes. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Corréziens&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Corréziennes&quot; (feminine). Its INSEE and postal code is 19.

==Geography==
The department makes up of most of Lower Limousin and owes its name to the Corrèze river whose entire course flows through the centre, and passes through the two main cities, Tulle and Brive-la-Gaillarde. Tulle is the prefecture of Corrèze, and Brive-la-Gaillarde the largest city.

===Location===
Since 2015, the department is administered by the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. To the north, it borders the departments of Haute-Vienne and the Creuse, to the east, the departments of Puy-de-Dôme and Cantal, to the south of that of the Lot and, finally, to the west of that of the Dordogne.

===Geology and relief===
Located west of the Massif Central, it consists of three zones: the Mountains (&quot;Montagne&quot;), the plateaus and the Brive Basin.

The mountains&#x27; peak at 977 m at Mount Bessou. Its Rhenohercynian Zone formation is quite eroded.

The plateaus have deep valleys that head towards the Dordogne river, such as at the Gimel waterfalls.

South-west of Corrèze, the Brive sedimentary basin enjoys a more favourable climate. There are sandstone hills like Collonges-la-Rouge.

===Hydrography===
The department is crossed by several rivers, such as Vézère, Corrèze or the Dordogne.

===Climate===
The department transitions between the Aquitaine and the Massif Central, the Corrèze department sees its elevation gradually rise from the basin of Brive to the Plateau de Millevaches, watershed of the Atlantic facade. This relief explains the wide variety of climates of Corrèze.

===Principal towns===
The most populous commune is Brive-la-Gaillarde; the prefecture Tulle is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 4,000 inhabitants:

==History==
Corrèze is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It includes part of the former province of Limousin (the Bas-Limousin).

Within Corrèze the nineteenth-century railway planners, influenced in part by the department&#x27;s topography, endowed Brive-la-Gaillarde with good connections and a major junction from which railway lines fanned out in six different directions. The railways arrived in 1860, at an opportune moment, directly after phylloxera had destroyed the local wine industry. The new railways enabled the farms in the area surrounding Brive to specialise in fruits and vegetables which they could now transport rapidly to the larger population centres of central and southern France. Locally, the new agriculture triggered the development, in the Brive basin, of related businesses and industries such as the manufacture of jams and liquors, as well as timber/paper-based packaging businesses.

==Demographics==
The 1851 census recorded a population of 320,866: this remained relatively constant for the rest of the nineteenth century. During the twentieth century, however, Corrèze shared the experience of many of the country&#x27;s rural departments as the population fell steadily.

==Politics==

The President of the General Council was François Hollande of the Socialist Party until 2012 when he was elected President of the Republic. Jacques Chirac also served as a Deputy of the National Assembly from here for many years.

<text>Damballa, also spelled Damballah, Dambala, Dambalah, among other variations (), is one of the most important of all loa, spirits in West African Vodun, Haitian Voodoo and other African diaspora religious traditions such as Obeah. He is traditionally portrayed as a great white or black serpent, but may also be depicted as a rainbow. Damballa originated in the city of Wedo (Whydah or Ouidah) in modern-day Benin. 

== Mythology ==

Damballa is said to be the sky father and the primordial creator of all life, or the first thing created by the Bondye. In those Vodou societies that view Damballa as the primordial creator, he created the cosmos by using his 7000 coils to form the stars and the planets in the heavens and to shape the hills and valleys on Earth. In others, being the first thing created by God, creation was undertaken through him. By shedding the serpent skin, Damballa created all the waters on the Earth. As a serpent, he moves between land and water, generating life, and through the earth, uniting the land with the waters below. Damballa is usually syncretized with either Saint Patrick or Moses. He is counted among the Rada loa.

Damballa is seen as benevolent and patient, wise and kind, yet detached and removed from the trials and tribulations of daily human life. His presence brings peace and represents a continuum, &quot;at once the ancient past and the assurance of the future.&quot; As a serpent, and due to his extreme age, he does not speak, but may whistle or make a soft, hissing sound.

Like many other loa, Damballa is subdivided into spirits who play different roles. For example, Damballa Tocan is a spirit of the intellect. When he manifests in the Petro rites, he is Damballa La Flambo. 

Damballa&#x27;s wife is Ayida-Weddo, although in some Vodou societies, she is his sister and in others, Damballa himself after a different fashion. Erzulie is his lover, although, once again, she may be considered his wife in some societies.

== Worship ==

When a serviteur is believed to be possessed by Damballa during a ceremony, he or she moves on the floor like a serpent. A white sheet is laid down for him, and another waved over him to fan and cool him. His purity is such that it cannot be allowed to be exposed to impure or unclean things. Some peristyles maintain a basin full of water into which the possessed will plunge, to swim and cool off. 

Offerings to him include milk, white foods and flowers, rice, coconut, orgeat syrup, and a perfume called &quot;lotion pompeia&quot;. Damballa&#x27;s symbol is an egg, so his offering &quot;par excellence&quot; is a white, uncooked egg on a mound of white flour.

==In popular culture==

Bahamian folk musician Exuma wrote and recorded the song &quot;Dambala&quot; for his 1970 self-titled album, in which he exhorts Dambala and God to punish slavers. The song was later covered by Nina Simone in many live performances.

A segment in the Amicus 1964 portmanteau horror film &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; features an unscrupulous jazz musician (Roy Castle) appropriating ritual music of a Dambalah ceremony.

A 1981 short-story collection by African-American writer John Edgar Wideman is entitled &quot;Damballah&quot;. 

In the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise, Damballa&#x27;s name is used in the voodoo incantation by the main antagonist Chucky to transfer his soul into his Good Guy doll host.

In Sierra&#x27;s &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot;, while investigating a series of murders in New Orleans, protagonist Gabriel Knight learns about Damballa as one of the main Voodoo loas worshiped by a local sect.

In the animated series &quot;Conan: The Adventurer&quot; episode &quot;Bones of Damballa&quot;, the High Priest Sadinar worships Damballa, revealed to be an aspect of the serpent god Set.

In &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; in episode &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;.

In the book &quot;Pays sans chapeau&quot; by Dany Laferrière.

In &quot;Extralarge&quot; in the episode &quot;Extralarge: Black Magic&quot; (1992).

In &quot;The Champions&quot; episode &quot;Shadow of the Panther&quot;, a stage magician in Haiti performs under the name Damballa.

<text>Corse-du-Sud (; , or ; ) is (as of 2019) an administrative department of France, consisting of the southern part of the island of Corsica. The corresponding departmental territorial collectivity merged with that of Haute-Corse on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica, with territorial elections coinciding with the dissolution of the separate council. Although its administrative powers were ceded to the new territorial collectivity, it continues to remain an administrative department in its own right. In 2019, it had a population of 158,507.

== History==
The department was formed on 1 January 1976, when the single department of Corsica was divided into Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud. Its boundaries corresponded to the former department of Liamone, which existed from 1793 to 1811.

On 6 February 1998, Corse-du-Sud&#x27;s prefect Claude Érignac was assassinated in Ajaccio. The Corsican nationalist Yvan Colonna was eventually convicted of the crime.

On 6 July 2003 a referendum rejected increased autonomy by a small majority, with 50.98 percent voting against and 49.02 percent for. This was a major setback for the French Minister of the Interior, Nicolas Sarkozy, who had hoped to use Corsica as the first step in his decentralization programme.

On 1 January 2018, Corse-du-Sud&#x27;s administrative powers were partly ceded to the new territorial collectivity of Corsica.

== Geography ==
The department is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and on the north by the department of Haute-Corse. The entire island of Corsica is mountainous with many beautiful beaches.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Ajaccio, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 3 communes with more than 4,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==

The people living in Corse-du-Sud are called &quot;Suttanacci&quot;.
According to an INSEE study, in the period 2020-2021 9.1% of the population were immigrants and 11.3% were descendants of immigrants (at least one parent). 

==Politics==

The current prefect of Corse-du-Sud (and also prefect of the collectivity of Corsica) is Amaury de Saint-Quentin, who took office on 7 March 2022.

===Current National Assembly representatives===

== Tourism ==
The former department enjoys the mild and hot climate of Mediterranean Islands, and therefore attracts a lot of tourists. Its perhaps largest tourist attraction is the city of Bonifacio, part of which is built upon a huge cliff.
But inside mountains are beautiful as well, especially the Aiguilles de Bavella, some naked, needle-like rocks.

<text>Ayizan (also Grande Ai-Zan, Aizan, or Ayizan Velekete, Aisa, Mama Aisa) is the loa of the marketplace and commerce in Vodou, especially in Benin, Haiti and Suriname.

==Background==
She is a racine, or root loa, associated with Vodoun rites of initiation (called kanzo). Just as her husband Loko is the archetypal houngan (priest), Ayizan is regarded as the first, or archetypal, mambo (priestess), and as such is also associated with priestly knowledge and mysteries, particularly those of initiation and the natural world.

As the spiritual parents of the priesthood, she and her husband are two of the loa involved in the kanzo rites in which the priest/ess-to-be is given the asson (sacred rattle and tool of the priesthood) and are both powerful guardians of &quot;reglemen&quot; or the correct and appropriate form of Vodoun service.

She is with the Catholic Saint Clare. Her symbol is the palm frond, and she drinks no alcohol. Her colors are most commonly silver, blue, and white.

<text>Haute-Corse (; , or ; ) is a department of France, consisting of the northern part of the island of Corsica. The corresponding departmental territorial collectivity merged with that of Corse-du-Sud on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica, with territorial elections coinciding with the dissolution of the separate councils. However, even though its administrative powers were ceded to the new territorial collectivity, it continues to remain an administrative department in its own right. In 2019, it had a population of 181,933.

== History ==
The department was formed on 1 January 1976, when the department of Corsica was divided into Upper Corsica (&quot;Haute-Corse&quot;) and Southern Corsica (&quot;Corse-du-Sud&quot;). The department corresponds exactly to the former department of Golo, which existed between 1793 and 1811.

On 6 July 2003, a referendum on increased autonomy was voted down by a very thin majority: 50.98 percent against to 49.02 percent for. This was a major setback for French Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy, who had hoped to use Corsica as the first step in his decentralization policies.

On 1 January 2018, Haute-Corse&#x27;s administrative powers were partly ceded to the new territorial collectivity of Corsica.

== Geography ==
The department is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and on the south by the department of Corse-du-Sud. Rivers include the Abatesco, Golo and Tavignano.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Bastia, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
The people living in the department are called &quot;Supranacci&quot;. Most people of the department lives on coastal areas throughout highway.
==Politics==

The current prefect of Haute-Corse is François Ravier, who took office on 3 June 2019.

<text>The ICON (also the CEMCorp ICON, Burroughs ICON, and Unisys ICON, and nicknamed the bionic beaver) was a networked personal computer built specifically for use in schools, to fill a standard created by the Ontario Ministry of Education. It was based on the Intel 80186 CPU and ran an early version of QNX, a Unix-like operating system. The system was packaged as an all-in-one machine similar to the Commodore PET, and included a trackball for mouse-like control. Over time, a number of GUI-like systems appeared for the platform, based on the system&#x27;s NAPLPS-based graphics system.

The ICON was widely used in the mid to late 1980s, but disappeared after that time with the widespread introduction of PCs and Apple Macintoshes.

== History ==

===Development===

==== Origin ====

In 1981, four years after the first microcomputers for mainstream consumers appeared, the Ontario Ministry of Education sensed that microcomputers could be an important component of education. In June the Minister of Education, Bette Stephenson, announced the need for computer literacy for all students and formed the Advisory Committee on Computers in Education to guide their efforts. She stated that:

It is now clear that one of the major goals that education must add to its list of purposes, is computer literacy. The world of the very near future requires that all of us have some understanding of the processes and uses of computers.

According to several contemporary sources, Stephenson was the driving force behind the project; &quot;whenever there was a problem she appears to have &#x27;moved heaven and earth&#x27; to get it back on the tracks.&quot;

The Ministry recognized that a small proportion of teachers and other school personnel were already quite involved with microcomputers and that some schools were acquiring first-generation machines. These acquisitions were uneven, varying in brand and model not just between school boards, but among schools within boards and even classroom to classroom. Among the most popular were the Commodore PET which had a strong following in the new computer programming classes due to its tough all-in-one construction and built-in support for Microsoft BASIC, and the Apple II which had a wide variety of educational software, mostly aimed at early education.

The Ministry wanted to encourage uses of microcomputers that supported its curriculum guidelines and was willing to underwrite the development of software for that purpose. However, the wide variety of machines being used meant that development costs had to be spread over several platforms. Additionally, many of the curriculum topics they wanted to cover required more storage or graphics capability than at least some of the machines then in use, if not all of them. Educational software was in its infancy, and many hardware acquisitions were made without a clear provision for educational software or a plan for use.

A series of Policy Memos followed outlining the Committee&#x27;s views. Policy Memo 47 stated that computers are to be used creatively, and for information retrieval; at the time most systems were used solely for programming. They also announced funding for the development of educational software on an estimated 6000 machines. The Ministry decided that standardizing the computers would reduce maintenance costs, and allow for the development of consistent educational software. The Ministry contracted the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance (CATA) to help develop specifications for the new system.

==== Design selection ====

Policy Memos 68–73 followed in early 1983, stating that none of the existing platforms had all the qualities needed to be truly universal. The idea of a new machine quickly gained currency, with the added bonus that it would help develop a local microcomputer industry. In order to make the new machine attractive, the Ministry agreed to fund up to 75% of the purchase price from their own budget. When the plan was first announced there was widespread concern among educators. Their main complaint is that the Ministry would select a standard that was not powerful enough for their needs. A secondary concern was that the time delay between announcing and introducing the computer would be lengthy, a period in which existing purchases could be funded instead.

The first set of concerns were rendered moot when the specifications were introduced in March 1983 in the &quot;Functional Requirements for Microcomputers for Educational Use in Ontario Schools—Stage I.&quot; The physical design required a PET-like all-in-one case, headphones output for voice and sound effects, and a trackball for mouse-like pointing support. Inside the case, the specification called for a processor and support systems to allow a multitasking operating system to be used, selecting the Intel 80186 as the CPU. Color graphics were specified, at least as an option, along with monochrome and color monitors on top. Voice synthesis was built in, and the keyboard provided for accented characters. Additionally, the systems would include no local storage at all, and would instead rely on a networked file server containing a hard drive.

The specification was considerably in advance of the state of the art of the time, and when it was delivered commentators immediately reversed their earlier concerns and suggested the machine was too powerful, and would therefore be available in too small numbers.

==== CEMCORP ====

To deliver such a machine, Robert Arn, a member of the CATA team, set up CEMCORP, the &quot;Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation&quot;. When the specification was announced in 1983, CEMCORP was announced as the winner of a $10 million contract to develop and supply the initial machines. An additional $5 million in funding was announced to cover development of new software applications, while the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) was asked to convert 30 existing programs to the new machine. In order to be able to afford what was expected to be an expensive machine, the Ministry announced a special &quot;Recognized Extraordinary Expenditure&quot; (REE) grant that would provide for up to 75% of the purchase costs of machines meeting the &quot;Grant Eligible Microcomputer Systems&quot; or &quot;G.E.M.S.&quot; specifications.

At the time, only the ICON met the GEMS requirements, which cut its purchase price from around CAD$2500 to a mere $495 (USD$2700 and $696) – less expensive than most existing microcomputers. The entire program was politically explosive throughout its gestation as a result, causing a continual stream of news stories. Critics complained that other machines could be bought for half the cost, but supporters pushed back that no other machine at that price point supported the GEMS specifications. The release of the IBM Personal Computer/AT in 1984 reopened the debate and made nightly news, as it used a newer and more advanced CPU than the ICON: the 80286. Around this time other platforms, such as the Waterloo PORT networking system, gained approval for the government support that had originally been the province of the ICON.

===Production===

The basic ICON design had reached &quot;beta quality&quot; after just over a year, using off the shelf parts, the hardware manufactured by Microtel and operating system from Quantum Software Systems. The original Microtel machines were first introduced to Ontario schools in 1984 in small numbers, packaged in a short-lived dark brown case. At this point Burroughs Canada was brought in to sell and support the machine. Soon, Sperry and Burroughs merged to form Unisys in 1986. Several generations of ICON machines were produced, evolving steadily to become more PC-like. They were built into the early 1990s, but by this point were used almost entirely for running DOS and Windows programs.

=== Cancellation ===

Throughout the project&#x27;s lifetime it was subject to continual debate and much political rhetoric. A 1992 article on the topic complained:

Bette Stephenson favoured top-down decision making and as a result got trapped by her tunnel vision. Her ICON computer fiasco drained millions from the provincial
treasury and created a white elephant scorned by boards and shunned by teachers... Computer resources were forced upon the school system as a result of a top-down government decision that was taken precipitously and without research.

The Ministry ceased all support for the ICON in 1994, making it orphaned technology, and the Archives of Ontario declined to take ICON hardware and copies of the ICON software, which were destroyed. This was controversial in its own right, as others maintained that it could be sent to other schools that lacked extensive Information Technology. Despite the development of the ICON program, equality among schools was not assured because each school community could afford different capital outlays depending on the parents&#x27; affluence.

== Design ==

The ICON system was based on a workstation/file server model, with no storage local to the workstations. The workstations and servers were internally similar, based on Intel 80186 microprocessors running at 7.16 MHz, and connected to each other using ARCNET. Several upgrades were introduced into the ICON line over time. The ICON2 sported a redesigned case, a detached keyboard with integrated trackball, expanded RAM, and facilities for an internal hard disk. The CPU was upgraded to the 386 in the Series III, while an &quot;ICON-on-a-card&quot; for PCs also appeared.

The original ICON workstations were housed in a large wedge-shaped steel case, with a full-sized keyboard mounted slightly left-of-center and a trackball mounted to the right. A rubber bumper-strip ran along the front edge, a precaution against a particular type of cut users sometimes got from the PET&#x27;s sharp case. Graphics were generated by a Hitachi HD46505 SP video controller, supporting NAPLPS. The EGA monitor was mounted on top of a tilt-and-swivel mount, a welcome improvement on the PET. It also included TI&#x27;s TMS5220 speech chip, originally designed for the TI-99, and would speak the vaguely obscene word &quot;dhtick&quot; when starting up. Early Microtel machines were dark brown, but the vast majority of examples in the classroom were a more nondescript beige.

The fileserver, sometimes referred to as the LexICON, was a simple rectangular box with an internal 10MB hard drive and a 5.25&quot; floppy drive opening to the front, and parallel port for a shared printer. Later Lexicons included a 64MB hard disk, divided into two partitions. User accounts on the ICON were created on the hard drive, and the users had to use Unix commands to copy files to a floppy if needed. This contrasts with the system seen on PET computers of the same era, where the user saved files directly to the shared floppy as if they were attached to the local machine.

Both the client and server ran the Unix-like QNX as their operating system with the addition of network file-sharing, the basic portions of it embedded in ROM. To this they added a NAPLPS/Telidon-based graphics system, which was intended to be used with the trackball to make interactive programs. The system included a Paint programme that used the trackball, but did not include a usable GUI, although there were several attempts to produce one. QNX 2.0.1 included a modest one called &quot;House&quot;, and another was built at least to the prototype stage by Helicon Systems in Toronto and appeared in one form as Ambience, though its capabilities were limited. A later upgrade called ICONLook improved upon this greatly, but it was apparently too slow to use realistically. Helicon Systems also produced a MIDI interface for the original ICON.

The biggest problem for the machine was a lack of software. The ICON was originally designed to let teachers create and share their own lessonware, using a simple hypertext-based system where pages could either link to other pages or run programs written in C. The &quot;anyone can create lessonware&quot; model was rejected by the Ministry of Education before the ICON shipped (in favour of a model under which the Ministry funded and controlled all lessonware), leaving the ICON with only the QNX command line interface and the Cemcorp-developed text editor application.

The various Watcom programming languages were quickly ported to the system, but beyond that, the educational software teachers could expect was few and far between. The Ministry contracted for a number of applications, but the small target market and the sometimes difficult process required to secure such contracts were significant obstacles for realistic commercial development.

<text>Côte-d&#x27;Or () is a département in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of Northeastern France. In 2019, it had a population of 534,124. Its prefecture is Dijon and subprefectures are Beaune and Montbard.

== History ==

Côte-d&#x27;Or is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was formed from part of the former province of Burgundy. It is arguably unique among the departments in having a name which is poetic, rather than geographic. Given by the representative of Dijon (:fr:Charles-André-Rémy Arnoult), it is said to refer to the autumn gold of the flanks of the hills in the wine-growing area.

== Geography ==

The department is part of the current region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It is surrounded by the departments of Yonne, Nièvre, Saône-et-Loire, Jura, Aube, Haute-Saône, and Haute-Marne.

A chain of hills called the Plateau de Langres runs from north-east to south-west through the department to the north of Dijon and continues south-westwards as the Côte d&#x27;Or escarpment, from which the department takes its name. It is the south-east facing slope of this escarpment which is the site of the celebrated Burgundy vineyards. To the west of the Plateau de Langres, towards Champagne, lies the densely wooded district of Châtillonais. To the south-east of the plateau and escarpment, the department lies in the broad, flat-bottomed valley of the middle course of the Saône.

Rivers include: 
* The Saône
* The Seine rises in the southern end of the Plateau de Langres.
* The Ouche rises on the dip slope of the escarpment and flows to the Saône via Dijon.
* The Armançon rises on the dip slope of the escarpment and flows north-westward.
* The Arroux rises on the dip slope of the escarpment at the southern end of the department.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the department is continental, with abundant rain on the west side of the central range.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Dijon, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Costaloriens&quot;.

Population development since 1791:

== Politics ==

The President of the Departmental Council is François Sauvadet of the Union of Democrats and Independents.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

== Economy ==
This is a premier wine-growing region of France. It produces what are arguably the world&#x27;s finest, and definitely most expensive Pinot noir and Chardonnay wines from some of the most rigorously and painstakingly (thanks to the region&#x27;s many monasteries) classified vineyards in the world. Wine from the Côte-d&#x27;Or was a favorite of the emperor Charlemagne. Other crops include cereal grains and potatoes. Sheep and cattle are also raised in the department. The region is famous for Dijon mustard.

There are coal mines and heavy industry, including steel, machinery, and earthenware.
The industries most developed in Côte-d&#x27;Or are
* agriculture and food (14% of employees)
* metallurgy and metal manufacture (12% of employees)
* chemicals, rubber and plastics (12% of employees)
* pharmacy
* electrical and electronic components and equipment
* wood and paper industries.
The big works are generally in the conurbation of Dijon although the biggest (CEA Valduc) is at Salives in the Plateau de Langres. There is also the SEB metal works at Selongey below the plateau on the margin of the Saône plain and the Valourec metalworking group at Montbard in the west of the department on the River Brenne near its confluence with the Armançon.
The Pharmaceutical industry has shown the greatest growth in recent years.
However, since the Dijon employment statistics zone includes the urban and administrative centre of the Burgundy region, the service sector is proportionately bigger there in relation to the industrial, than in the other three zones of Côte-d&#x27;Or.

== Tourism ==
Some of the major tourist attractions are the Gothic abbey church of Saint-Seine-l&#x27;Abbaye and the 11th-century Romanesque abbey church at Saulieu, as well the 12th-century Château de Bussy Rabutin at Bussy-le-Grand. The Abbey of Cîteaux, headquarters of the Cistercian Order, lies to the east of Nuits-Saint-Georges in the south of the department.

<text>Creuse (; or ) is a department in central France named after the river Creuse. After Lozère, it is the second least populated department in France. It is bordered by Indre and Cher to the north, Allier and Puy-de-Dôme to the east, Corrèze to the south, and Haute-Vienne to the west. In 2020, the population of this department is 115,995, while the official estimates in 2022 is 113,711.

Guéret, the Prefecture of Creuse has a population approximately 12,000, making it the largest settlement in the department. The next biggest town is La Souterraine and then Aubusson. The department is situated in the former Province of La Marche. Creuse is one of the most rural and sparsely populated departments in France, with a population density of , and a 2019 population of 116,617 - the second-smallest of any Departments in France. The land use is mostly agricultural and the department is well known for its chestnut and hazelnut production, and for the Charolais and Limousin cattle breeds.

==History==
Creuse is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from the former province of La Marche.

The County of Marche was a county in medieval France that approximately corresponded to the modern &quot;département&quot; of Creuse. Marche first appeared as a separate fief around the mid-10th century, when William III, Duke of Aquitaine, gave it to one of his vassals named Boso, who took the title of count. In the 12th century, the countship passed to the family of Lusignan. They also were sometimes counts of Angoulême and counts of Limousin. With the death of the childless Count Guy in 1308, his possessions in La Marche were seized by Philip IV of France. In 1316 the king made La Marche an &quot;appanage&quot; for his youngest son the Prince, afterwards Charles IV. Several years later in 1327, La Marche passed into the hands of the House of Bourbon. The family of Armagnac held it from 1435 to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons. In 1527 La Marche was seized by Francis I and became part of the domains of the French crown. It was divided into &quot;Haute Marche&quot; and &quot;Basse Marche&quot;, the estates of the former continuing until the 17th century. From 1470 to the Revolution, the province was under the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Paris.

In 1886, Bourganeuf ville lumière, located in a remote part of Creuse, became somewhat improbably the third town in France to receive a public electricity supply. Three years later, in 1889, the construction of a primitive hydro-electric factory at Cascade of the Jarrauds (&quot;Cascade des Jarrauds&quot;) on the little river Maulde at Saint-Martin-Château, away, established a more reliable electricity supply for the little town. The creation of a power line from the plant to Bourganeuf was supervised by an innovative engineer named Marcel Deprez; this was the first time that a power line over such a long distance had been constructed in France. The achievement was crowned with the region&#x27;s first telephone line, which was installed to permit instant communication between the generating station and the newly illuminated town.

==Geography==

Creuse is part of the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

It is in the Massif Central and permeated by the Creuse and its tributaries. The river is dammed at several locations both for water supply and hydroelectricity generation. As is typical for an inland area of continental Europe, Creuse has relatively cold winters with some snowfall into April, but also hot summers. Rain falls throughout the year because of the relatively high elevation.

The topography is principally rolling hills intersected by often steep valleys. The terrestrial ecology is typically cool temperate with a species mix common in the western UK: with oak, ash, chestnut, hazel and &quot;Prunus&quot; species dominating the woodlands. There are no commercial vineyards. Much of the farming is beef cattle: Charolais and Limousin, and also sheep.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Guéret, the prefecture. As the second-least populous department of France, Creuse has no big cities and towns. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 2,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
The population peaked at 287,075 in 1851, after which it declined gently until the First World War. During and after the war, the decline in population became much more rapid both because of the death and disruption that characterised the war years and because of the higher wages available to any workers with marketable skills in the economically more dynamic towns and cities outside Creuse. By 1921 the registered population had slumped by almost 38,000 (approximately 14%) in ten years to 228,244, and the decline continued throughout the twentieth century.

Over the last four decades of the twentieth century Creuse experienced the greatest proportional population decline of any French department, from 164,000 in 1960 to 124,000 in 1999 – a decrease of 24%.

==Politics==

The President of the Departmental Council is Valérie Simonet of The Republicans.

===Current National Assembly Representative===

==Culture==

===Language===
Until the 1980s, Occitan was the primary language of rural areas. There remain three different Occitan dialects in use in Limousin, although their use is rapidly declining. These are:
* Limousin () dialect
* Auvergnat () dialect in the East
* in the North, the Crescent transition area between Occitan and French is sometimes considered as a separate (basically Occitan) dialect called Marchois ().

===Cuisine===
The Creuse Cake is a dessert named after the region. It is made with butter and hazelnuts. There are many varieties, and they are sold throughout France.

==Tourism==
As a traditionally rural and lightly populated area, with ancient and typical &quot;art de vivre&quot;, original stone architecture, no major urban center and many heritage site such as castles, abbeys and Celtic stone monuments: the Creuse department has become a Green tourism destination since the late 1990s. Creuse enjoys a temperate climate with mild springs and autumns, rather cold and snowy but sunny winters, and relatively warm and sunny summers, but not as hot as in the southern parts of France. Thanks to its preserved forested landscape, little pollution and wonderful stone buildings, many foreigners (notably British and Dutch, but also German and Belgian) have sought to buy holiday homes in Creuse.

The major tourist attractions are the tapestry museum in Aubusson and the many castles, notably those of Villemonteix, Boussac, and Banizette. The monastery of Moutier-d&#x27;Ahun has exceptional wood carvings from the 17th century. (:fr:Abbaye de Moutier-d&#x27;Ahun). After World War 1, some towns in France set up pacifist war memorials. Instead of commemorating the glorious dead, these memorials denounce war with figures of grieving widows and children rather than soldiers. Such memorials provoked anger among veterans and the military in general. The most famous is at Gentioux-Pigerolles in the department (see picture on the left). Below the column which lists the name of the fallen, stands an orphan in bronze pointing to an inscription &#x27;Maudite soit la guerre&#x27; (Cursed be war). Feelings ran so high that the memorial was not officially inaugurated until 1990 and soldiers at the nearby army camp were under orders to turn their heads when they walked past.

The Chapelle du Mas-Saint-Jean is in Saint-Sulpice-le-Dunois. A local legend declares that Joan of Arc prayed there in about 1430.

Guéret, Creuse is also home to a large nearby animal park named Les Loups de Chabrières containing some of France&#x27;s few remaining wolves, held in semi-captivity. It includes 24 European Grey Wolves, two Canadian White Wolves and two Canadian Black Wolves in five enclosures.

Motor racing Mas du Clos It is twelve kilometers from Aubusson at the foot of the family castle of Saint-Avit-de-Tardes. Pierre Bardinon creates all pieces in 1963.

<text>In linguistics and etymology, suppletion is traditionally understood as the use of one word as the inflected form of another word when the two words are not cognate. For those learning a language, suppletive forms will be seen as &quot;irregular&quot; or even &quot;highly irregular&quot;. For example, &quot;go:went&quot; is a suppletive paradigm, because &quot;go&quot; and &quot;went&quot; are not etymologically related, whereas &quot;mouse:mice&quot; is irregular but not suppletive, since the two words come from the same Old English ancestor.

The term &quot;suppletion&quot; implies that a gap in the paradigm was filled by a form &quot;supplied&quot; by a different paradigm. Instances of suppletion are overwhelmingly restricted to the most commonly used lexical items in a language.

==Irregularity and suppletion==

An irregular paradigm is one in which the derived forms of a word cannot be deduced by simple rules from the base form. For example, someone who knows only a little English can deduce that the plural of &quot;girl&quot; is &quot;girls&quot; but cannot deduce that the plural of &quot;man&quot; is &quot;men&quot;. Language learners are often most aware of irregular verbs, but any part of speech with inflections can be irregular.

For most synchronic purposes—first-language acquisition studies, psycholinguistics, language-teaching theory—it suffices to note that these forms are irregular. However, historical linguistics seeks to explain how they came to be so and distinguishes different kinds of irregularity according to their origins.

Most irregular paradigms (like &quot;man:men&quot;) can be explained by phonological developments that affected one form of a word but not another (in this case, Germanic umlaut). In such cases, the historical antecedents of the current forms once constituted a regular paradigm.

Historical linguistics uses the term &quot;suppletion&quot;
to distinguish irregularities like &quot;person:people&quot; or &quot;cow:cattle&quot; that cannot be so explained because the parts of the paradigm have not evolved out of a single form.

Hermann Osthoff coined the term &quot;suppletion&quot; in German in an 1899 study of the phenomenon in Indo-European languages.

Suppletion exists in many languages around the world. These languages are from various language families: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Semitic, Romance, etc.

For example, in Georgian, the paradigm for the verb &quot;to come&quot; is composed of four different roots (, , , and ; , , , ).

Similarly, in Modern Standard Arabic, the verb &#x27; (&#x27;come&#x27;) usually uses the form &#x27; for its imperative, and the plural of &#x27; (&#x27;woman&#x27;) is &#x27;.

Some of the more archaic Indo-European languages are particularly known for suppletion. Ancient Greek, for example, has some twenty verbs with suppletive paradigms, many with three separate roots.

==Example words==

=== To go ===
In English, the past tense of the verb &quot;go&quot; is &quot;went&quot;, which comes from the past tense of the verb &quot;wend&quot;, archaic in this sense. (The modern past tense of &quot;wend&quot; is &quot;wended&quot;.) See &quot;Go (verb)&quot;.

The Romance languages have a variety of suppletive forms in conjugating the verb &quot;to go&quot;, as these first-person singular forms illustrate (second-person singular forms in imperative):
The sources of these forms, numbered in the table, are six different Latin verbs:
# ‘to go, proceed’,
# ‘to go’
# ‘to go around’, also the source for Spanish and Portuguese ‘to walk’
# ‘to walk’, or perhaps another Latin root, a Celtic root, or a Germanic root or 
# suppletive perfective of ‘to be’.
# ‘to go along’.

Many of the Romance languages use forms from different verbs in the present tense; for example, French has ‘I go’ from , but ‘we go’ from . Galician-Portuguese has a similar example: from ‘to go’ and from ‘we go’; the former is somewhat disused in modern Portuguese but very alive in modern Galician. Even , from second-person plural of , is the only form for ‘you (plural) go’ both in Galician and Portuguese (Spanish , from ).

Sometimes, the conjugations differ between dialects. For instance, the &quot;Limba Sarda Comuna&quot; standard of Sardinian supported a fully regular conjugation of , but other dialects like Logudorese do not (see also Sardinian conjugation). In Romansh, &quot;Rumantsch Grischun&quot; substitutes present and subjunctive forms of &quot;ir&quot; with &quot;vom&quot; and &quot;giaja&quot; (both are from Latin &quot;vādere&quot; and &quot;īre&quot;, respectively) in the place of &quot;mon&quot; and &quot;mondi&quot; in Sursilvan.

Similarly, the Welsh verb ‘to go’ has a variety of suppletive forms such as ‘I shall go’ and ‘we went’. Irish ‘to go’ also has suppletive forms: ‘going’ and ‘will go’.

In Estonian, the inflected forms of the verb ‘to go’ were originally those of a verb cognate with the Finnish ‘to leave’, except for the passive and infinitive.

=== Good and bad ===
In Germanic, Romance (except Romanian), Celtic, Slavic (except Bulgarian and Macedonian), and Indo-Iranian languages, the comparative and superlative of the adjective &quot;good&quot; is suppletive; in many of these languages the adjective &quot;bad&quot; is also suppletive.
The comparison of &quot;good&quot; is also suppletive in → → and → → .

Similarly to the Italian noted above, the English adverb form of &quot;good&quot; is the unrelated word &quot;well&quot;, from Old English , cognate to &quot;to wish&quot;.

=== Great and small ===
Celtic languages:
:

In many Slavic languages, &quot;great&quot; and &quot;small&quot; are suppletive:
:

== Examples in languages ==
=== Albanian ===
In Albanian there are 14 irregular verbs divided into suppletive and non-suppletive:

=== Ancient Greek ===

Ancient Greek had a large number of suppletive verbs. A few examples, listed by principal parts:
:*&quot;erkhomai, eîmi/eleusomai, ēlthon, elēlutha, —, —&quot; &quot;go, come&quot;.
:*&quot;legō, eraō (erô) / leksō, eipon / eleksa, eirēka, eirēmai / lelegmai, elekhthēn / errhēthēn&quot; &quot;say, speak&quot;.
:*&quot;horaō, opsomai, eidon, heorāka / heōrāka, heōrāmai / ōmmai, ōphthēn&quot; &quot;see&quot;.
:*&quot;pherō, oisō, ēnegka / ēnegkon, enēnokha, enēnegmai, ēnekhthēn&quot; &quot;carry&quot;.
:*&quot;pōleō, apodōsomai, apedomēn, peprāka, peprāmai, eprāthēn&quot; &quot;sell&quot;.

=== Bulgarian ===
In Bulgarian, the word (&quot;man&quot;, &quot;human being&quot;) is suppletive. The strict plural form, , is used only in Biblical context (like &quot;brethren&quot; as the archaic or symbolic plural of &quot;brother&quot; in English). In modern usage it has been replaced by the Greek loan . The counter form (the special form for masculine nouns, used after numerals) is suppletive as well: (with the accent on the first syllable). For example, (&quot;two, three people&quot;); this form has no singular either. (A related but different noun is the plural , singular (&quot;soul&quot;), both with accent on the last syllable.)

=== English ===
In English, the complicated irregular verb &quot;to be&quot; has forms from several different roots:
*&quot;be&quot;, &quot;been&quot;, &quot;being&quot;—from Old English &quot;bēon&quot; (&quot;to be, become&quot;), from Proto-Germanic *&quot;beuną&quot; (&quot;to be, exist, come to be, become&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bʰúHt&quot; (“to grow, become, come into being, appear”), from the root *&quot;bʰuH-&quot; (&quot;to become, grow, appear&quot;).
*&quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;—from Middle English &quot;am, em, is, aren&quot;, from Old English &quot;eam, eom, is, earun, earon&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;immi&quot;, *&quot;izmi&quot;, *&quot;isti&quot;, *&quot;arun&quot;, all forms of the verb *&quot;wesaną&quot; (&quot;to be; dwell&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;h₁ésmi&quot; (&quot;I am, I exist&quot;), from the root *&quot;h₁es-&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;).
*&quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot;—from Old English &quot;wæs&quot;, &quot;wǣre&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;was&quot;, *&quot;wēz&quot;, from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;h₂wes&quot;- (&quot;to dwell, reside&quot;)

This verb is suppletive in most Indo-European languages, as well as in some non-Indo-European languages such as Finnish.

An incomplete suppletion exists in English with the plural of &quot;person&quot; (from the Latin ). The regular plural &quot;persons&quot; occurs mainly in legalistic use. More commonly, the singular of the unrelated noun &quot;people&quot; (from Latin ) is used as the plural; for example, &quot;two people were living on a one-person salary&quot; (note the plural verb). In its original sense of &quot;populace, ethnic group&quot;, &quot;people&quot; is itself a singular noun with regular plural &quot;peoples&quot;.
===Hungarian===
* The verb &quot;to be&quot;: (&quot;there is&quot;), , (&quot;I am&quot;, &quot;you are&quot;), (&quot;to be&quot;), (&quot;will be&quot;), , (&quot;there is not&quot;, &quot;there is neither&quot;, replacing + and + respectively).
* The verb (&quot;come&quot;) has the imperative (the regular is dated).
* The numeral (&quot;many/a lot&quot;) has the comparative and the superlative .
* The adverb (&quot;a little&quot;) has the comparative and the superlative .
* Many inflected forms of personal pronouns are formed by using the suffix as the base: (&quot;to me&quot;) from (dative suffix) and (first person singular possessive suffix). Even among these, the superessive form (&quot;on&quot;) uses the root instead of the suffix .
* The numerals , (&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;) have the ordinal forms , (&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;). However they are regular in compounds: , (&quot;eleventh&quot;, &quot;twelfth&quot;).

===Irish===

Several irregular Irish verbs are suppletive:

* &quot;abair&quot; (to say): derived from Old Irish &quot;as·beir&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European roots *&quot;h₁eǵʰs&quot;- (&quot;out&quot;) and *&quot;bʰer&quot;- (&quot;bear, carry&quot;). However, the verbal noun &quot;rá&quot; is derived from Old Irish &quot;rád&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;reh₂dʰ-&quot; (&quot;perform successfully&quot;).
* &quot;bí&quot; (to be): derived from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bʰuH&quot;- (&quot;grow, become, come into being, appear&quot;). However, the present tense form &quot;tá&quot; is derived from Old Irish &quot;at·tá&quot;, from Proto-Celtic *&quot;ad-tāyeti&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;steh₂&quot;- (&quot;stand&quot;).
* &quot;beir&quot; (to catch): derived from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bʰer&quot;- (&quot;bear, carry&quot;). However, the past tense form &quot;rug&quot; is derived from Old Irish &quot;rouic&quot;, which is from Proto-Celtic *&quot;ɸro-ōnkeyo&quot;-, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European roots *&quot;pro&quot;- (&quot;forth, forward&quot;) and *&quot;h₂neḱ&quot;- (&quot;reach&quot;).
* &quot;feic&quot; (to see): derived from Old Irish &quot;aicci&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;kʷey&quot;- (&quot;observe&quot;). However, the past tense form &quot;chonaic&quot; is derived from Old Irish &quot; ad·condairc&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;derḱ₂&quot;- (&quot;see&quot;).
* &quot;téigh&quot; (to go): derived from Old Irish &quot;téit&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;stéygʰeti&quot;- (&quot;to be walking, to be climbing&quot;). However, the future form &quot;rachaidh&quot; is derived from Old Irish &quot;regae&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;h₁r̥gʰ&quot;- (&quot;go, move&quot;), while the verbal noun &quot;dul&quot; is from *&quot;h₁ludʰét&quot; (&quot;arrive&quot;).

There are several suppletive comparative and superlative forms in Irish; in addition to the ones listed above, there is:
*&quot;fada&quot;, &quot;long&quot;; comparative &quot;níos faide&quot; or &quot;níos sia&quot; — &quot;fada&quot; is from Old Irish &quot;fota&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;wasdʰos&quot; (“long, wide”); compare Latin &quot;vāstus&quot; (“wide”), while &quot;sia&quot; is from Old Irish &quot;sír&quot; (&quot;long, long-lasting&quot;), from Proto-Celtic *&quot;sīros&quot; (“long”); compare Welsh/Breton &quot;hir&quot;.

===Japanese===
In modern Japanese, the copulae だ, である and です take な to create &quot;attributive forms&quot; of adjectival nouns (hence the English moniker, &quot;&quot;na&quot;-adjectives&quot;):

The &quot;conclusive&quot; and &quot;attributive&quot; forms, だ and な, were constructed similarly, from a combination of a particle and an inflection form of the old verb あり (&quot;ari&quot;, &quot;to exist&quot;).
*で + あり (&quot;conclusive&quot;) → であり → であ → だ
*に + ある (&quot;attributive&quot;) → なる → なん → な

(Note: で itself was also a contraction of earlier にて.)

In modern Japanese, である (&quot;conclusive&quot;) simply retains the older appearance of だ, while です is a different verb that can be used as a suppleted form of だ. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the etymology of です, one of which is a contraction of であります:
*で + あり (&quot;adverbial&quot;) + ます → であります → です

The basic construction of the negative form of a Japanese verb is the &quot;irrealis&quot; form followed by ない, which would result in such hypothetical constructions as *だらない and *であらない. However, these constructions are not used in modern Japanese, and the construction ではない is used instead. This is because *あらない, the hypothetically regular negative form of ある, is not used either, and is simply replaced with ない.
*あら (&quot;irrealis&quot;) + ない → ない
*であら (&quot;irrealis&quot;) + ない → ではない
*だら (&quot;irrealis&quot;) + ない → ではない → じゃない

While the auxiliary ない causes suppletion, other auxiliaries such as ん and ありません do not necessarily.
*あら (&quot;irrealis&quot;) + ん → あらん
*あり (&quot;adverbial&quot;) + ませ + ん → ありません
*であり (&quot;adverbial&quot;) + ませ + ん → でありません

For です, its historical &quot;irrealis&quot; form, でせ has not been attested to create a negative form (only でせう → でしょう has been attested, and there were and are no *でせん and *でせない). Thus, it has to borrow でありません as its negative form instead.

To express a potential meaning, as in &quot;can do&quot;, most verbs use the &quot;irrealis&quot; form followed by れる or られる. する, notably has no such construction, and has to use a different verb for this meaning, できる.

=== Latin ===
Latin has several suppletive verbs. A few examples, listed by principal parts:
:*&quot;sum, esse, fuī, futūrus&quot; - &quot;be&quot;.
:*&quot;ferō, ferre, tulī or tetulī, lātus&quot; - &quot;carry, bear&quot;.
:*&quot;fīō, fierī, factus sum&quot; (suppletive and semi-deponent) - &quot;become, be made, happen&quot;

=== Polish ===
In some Slavic languages, a few verbs have imperfective and perfective forms arising from different roots. For example, in Polish:

Note that , , , and are prefixes and are not part of the root

In Polish, the plural form of (&quot;year&quot;) is which comes from the plural of (&quot;summer&quot;). A similar suppletion occurs in (&quot;year&quot;) &gt; (genitive of &quot;years&quot;).

=== Romanian ===
The Romanian verb (&quot;to be&quot;) is suppletive and irregular, with the infinitive coming from Latin &quot;fieri&quot;, but conjugated forms from forms of already suppletive Latin &quot;sum&quot;. For example, (&quot;I am&quot;), (&quot;you are&quot;), (&quot;I have been&quot;), (&quot;I used to be&quot;), (&quot;I was&quot;); while the subjunctive, also used to form the future in (&quot;I will be/am going to be&quot;), is linked to the infinitive.

=== Russian ===
In Russian, the word (&quot;man, human being&quot;) is suppletive. The strict plural form, , is used only in Orthodox Church contexts, with numerals (e. g. &quot;five people&quot;) and in humorous context. It may have originally been the unattested . In any case, in modern usage, it has been replaced by , the singular form of which is known in Russian only as a component of compound words (such as ). This suppletion also exists in Polish ( &gt; ), Czech ( &gt; ), Serbo-Croatian ( &gt; ), Slovene ( &gt; ), and Macedonian ( () &gt; ()).

== Generalizations ==
Strictly speaking, suppletion occurs when different &quot;inflections&quot; of a lexeme (i.e., with the same lexical category) have etymologically &quot;unrelated&quot; stems. The term is also used in looser senses, albeit less formally.

=== Semantic relations ===
The term &quot;suppletion&quot; is also used in the looser sense when there is a semantic link between words but not an etymological one; unlike the strict inflectional sense, these may be in different lexical categories, such as noun/verb.

English noun/adjective pairs such as father/paternal or cow/bovine are also referred to as collateral adjectives. In this sense of the term, &quot;father&quot;/&quot;fatherly&quot; is non-suppletive. &quot;Fatherly&quot; is derived from &quot;father&quot;, while father/paternal is suppletive. Likewise &quot;cow&quot;/&quot;cowish&quot; is non-suppletive, while &quot;cow&quot;/&quot;bovine&quot; is suppletive.

In these cases, father/pater- and cow/bov- are cognate via Proto-Indo-European, but &#x27;paternal&#x27; and &#x27;bovine&#x27; are borrowings into English (via Old French and Latin). The pairs are distantly etymologically related, but the words are not from a single Modern English stem.

=== Weak suppletion ===
The term &quot;weak suppletion&quot; is sometimes used in contemporary synchronic morphology in reference to sets of stems whose alternations cannot be accounted for by synchronically productive phonological rules. For example, the two forms &quot;child&quot;/&quot;children&quot; are etymologically from the same source, but the alternation does not reflect any regular morphological process in modern English: this makes the pair appear to be suppletive, even though the forms go back to the same root.

In that understanding, English has abundant examples of weak suppletion in its verbal inflection: e.g. &quot;bring&quot;/&quot;brought&quot;, &quot;take&quot;/&quot;took&quot;, &quot;see&quot;/&quot;saw&quot;, etc. Even though the forms are etymologically related in each pair, no productive morphological rule can derive one form from the other in synchrony. Alternations just have to be learned by speakers — in much the same way as truly suppletive pairs such as &quot;go&quot;/&quot;went&quot;.

Such cases, which were traditionally simply labelled &quot;irregular&quot;, are sometimes described with the term &quot;weak suppletion&quot;, so as to restrict the term &quot;suppletion&quot; to etymologically unrelated stems.

<text>The Corn Laws were tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846. The word &quot;corn&quot; in British English denotes all cereal grains, including wheat, oats and barley. The laws were designed to keep corn prices high to favour domestic farmers, and represented British mercantilism. The Corn Laws blocked the import of cheap corn, initially by simply forbidding importation below a set price, and later by imposing steep import duties, making it too expensive to import it from abroad, even when food supplies were short. The House of Commons passed the corn law bill on 10 March 1815, the House of Lords on 20 March and the bill received royal assent on 23 March 1815.

The Corn Laws enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership. The laws raised food prices and the costs of living for the British public, and hampered the growth of other British economic sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing the disposable income of the British public.

The laws became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural areas. The first two years of the Great Famine in Ireland of 1845–1852 forced a resolution because of the urgent need for new food supplies. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, a Conservative, achieved repeal in 1846 with the support of the Whigs in Parliament, overcoming the opposition of most of his own party.

Economic historians see the repeal of the Corn Laws as a decisive shift towards free trade in Britain. According to one 2021 study, the repeal of the Corn Laws benefitted the bottom 90% of income earners in the United Kingdom economically, while causing income losses for the top 10% of income earners.

==Origins==

As a staple of life, as well as an important commodity of trade, corn and its traffic was long the subject of debate and of government regulation – the Tudors legislating against speculating in corn, and the Stuarts introducing import and export controls. Import had been regulated as early as 1670; and in 1689 traders were provided bounties for exporting rye, malt and wheat (all classified as corn at the time, the same commodities being taxed when imported into England). In 1773, the (13 Geo. 3. c. 43), &quot;An act to regulate the importation and exportation of corn&quot; repealed Elizabethan controls on grain speculation; but also shut off exports and allowed imports when the price was above 48 shillings per quarter (thus compromising to allow for interests of producers and consumers alike). The issue however remained one of public debate (by figures such as Edmund Burke) into the 1790s; and amendments to the 1773 act, favouring agricultural producers, were made in both 1791 and 1804.

In 1813, a House of Commons committee recommended excluding foreign-grown corn until the price of domestically grown corn exceeded 80 shillings per quarter (8 bushels), or the equivalent in 2004 prices of around £1,102 per tonne of wheat. The political economist Thomas Malthus believed this to be a fair price, and that it would be dangerous for Britain to rely on imported corn because lower prices would reduce labourers&#x27; wages, and manufacturers would lose out due to the decrease of purchasing power of landlords and farmers.
With the advent of peace when the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, corn prices decreased, and the Tory government of Lord Liverpool passed the (55 Geo. 3. c. 26) (officially &quot;An Act to amend the Laws now in force for regulating the Importation of Corn&quot;) to keep bread prices high. This resulted in serious rioting in London.

In 1816, the Year Without a Summer (caused by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia) caused famine by disastrously reducing crop yields. Reduced standard of living and food shortages due to poor harvests led to riots. But the ceiling price of 80 shillings a quarter for domestic grain was so high that, between 1815 and 1848, it was never reached. David Ricardo, however, espoused free trade so that Britain could use its capital and population to its comparative advantage.

==Opposition==


In 1820, the Merchants&#x27; Petition, written by Thomas Tooke, was presented to the House of Commons. The petition demanded free trade and an end to protective tariffs. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who claimed to be in favour of free trade, blocked the petition. He argued, speciously, that complicated restrictions made it difficult to repeal protectionist laws. He added, though, that he believed Britain&#x27;s economic dominance grew in spite of, not because of, the protectionist system. In 1821, the President of the Board of Trade, William Huskisson, composed a Commons committee report which recommended a return to the &quot;practically free&quot; trade of the pre-1815 years.

The &#x27; (3 Geo. 4. c. 60) decreed that corn could be imported when the price of domestically harvested corn rose to 80/– (£4) per quarter but that the import of corn would again be prohibited when the price fell to 70/– per quarter. After this act was passed, the corn price never rose to 80/– until 1828. In 1827, the landlords rejected Huskisson&#x27;s proposals for a sliding scale, and during the next year Huskisson and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, devised a new sliding scale for the &#x27; (9 Geo. 4. c. 60) whereby, when domestic corn was 52/– (£2/12/–) per quarter or less, the duty would be 34/8 (£1/14/8), and when the price increased to 73/– (£3/13/–), the duty decreased to one shilling.
The Whig governments, in power for most of the years between 1830 and 1841, decided not to repeal the Corn Laws. However the Liberal Whig MP Charles Pelham Villiers proposed motions for repeal in the House of Commons every year from 1837 to 1845. In 1842, the majority against repeal was 303; by 1845 this had fallen to 132. Although he had spoken against repeal until 1845, Robert Peel voted in favour in 1846. In 1853, when Villiers was made a Privy Counsellor, &quot;The Times&quot; stated that &quot;it was Mr Charles Villiers who practically originated the Free Trade movement&quot;.

In 1838, Villiers spoke at a meeting of 5,000 &quot;working-class men&quot; in Manchester. In 1840, under Villiers&#x27; direction, the Committee on Import Duties published a blue book examining the effects of the Corn Laws. Tens of thousands of copies were printed in pamphlet form by the Anti-Corn Law League, founded in 1838. The report was quoted in the major newspapers, reprinted in America, and published in an abridged form by &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

In the 1841 election, Sir Robert Peel became Prime Minister and Richard Cobden, a major proponent of free trade, was elected for the first time. Peel had studied the works of Adam Smith, David Hume and David Ricardo, and proclaimed in 1839: &quot;I have read all that has been written by the gravest authorities on political economy on the subject of rent, wages, taxes, tithes.&quot; He voted against repeal each year from 1837 to 1845. In 1842, in response to the Blue book published by Villiers&#x27; 1840 Committee on Import Duties, Peel offered a concession by modifying the sliding scale. He reduced the maximum duty to 20/– if the price were to fall to 51/– or less. In 1842, Peel&#x27;s fellow-Conservative Monckton Milnes said, at the time of this concession, that Villiers was &quot;the solitary Robinson Crusoe sitting on the rock of Corn Law repeal&quot;.

According to historian Asa Briggs, the Anti-Corn Law League was a large, nationwide middle-class moral crusade with a Utopian vision; its leading advocate Richard Cobden promised that repeal would settle four great problems simultaneously:

The landlords claimed that manufacturers like Cobden wanted cheap food so that they could reduce wages and thus maximise their profits, an opinion shared by socialist Chartists. Karl Marx said: &quot;The campaign for the abolition of the Corn Laws had begun and the workers&#x27; help was needed. The advocates of repeal therefore promised, not only a Big Loaf (which was to be doubled in size) but also the passing of the Ten Hours Bill&quot; (to reduce working hours). In 1876, Thomas Carlyle commented on John Bright, co-founder of the League along with Cobden: &quot;as for that party, Bright, Cobden and Co., &#x27;Cheap and Nasty&#x27; was their watchword. It was folly to suppose good things were to be had cheap. The nation had been deluded.&quot;

The Anti-Corn Law League was agitating peacefully for repeal. They funded writers like William Cooke Taylor to travel the manufacturing regions of northern England to research their cause. Taylor published a number of books as an Anti-Corn Law propagandist, most notably, &quot;The Natural History of Society&quot; (1841), &quot;Notes of a tour in the manufacturing districts of Lancashire&quot; (1842), and &quot;Factories and the Factory System&quot; (1844). Cobden and the rest of the Anti-Corn Law League believed that cheap food meant greater real wages and Cobden praised a speech by a working man who said:

The magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; was founded in September 1843 by politician James Wilson with help from the Anti-Corn Law League; his son-in-law Walter Bagehot later became its editor.

==Prelude to repeal==
In February 1844, the Duke of Richmond initiated the Central Agricultural Protection Society (CAPS, commonly known as the &quot;Anti-League&quot;) to campaign in favour of the Corn Laws.

In 1844, the agitation subsided as there were fruitful harvests. The situation changed in late 1845 with poor harvests and the Great Famine in Ireland; Britain experienced scarcity and Ireland starvation. Nevertheless, Ireland continued to export substantial quantities of food to Great Britain despite its domestic privations. The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor. Peel argued in Cabinet that tariffs on grain should be rescinded by Order in Council until Parliament assembled to repeal the Corn Laws. His colleagues resisted this. On 22 November 1845 the Whig Leader of the Opposition Lord John Russell announced in an open letter to the electors in the City of London his support for immediate Corn Law repeal and called upon the government to take urgent action to avert famine.

The appearance of Russell&#x27;s letter spurred Peel and the free-traders in his cabinet to press ahead with repeal measures over the objections of their protectionist colleagues. On 4 December 1845, an announcement appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; that the government had decided to recall Parliament in January 1846 to repeal the Corn Laws. Lord Stanley resigned from the Cabinet in protest. It quickly became clear to Peel that he would not be able to bring most of his own party with him in support of repeal and so on 11 December he resigned as Prime Minister in frustration. The Queen sent for Russell to form a government but, with the Whigs a minority in the Commons, he struggled to assemble the necessary support. Russell offered Cobden the post of Vice-President of the Board of Trade but he refused, preferring to remain an advocate of free trade outside the government. On 21 December Russell informed the Queen that he was unable to accept office. Later that same day Peel agreed to carry on as Prime Minister but, with the majority of his own party opposing his proposals, he was now dependent on the backing of the Whigs to carry repeal.

After Parliament was recalled the CAPS started a campaign of resistance. In the rural counties the CAPS was practically supplanting the local Conservative associations and in many areas the independent free holding farmers were resisting the most fiercely.

==Repeal==

In 1845 and 1846, the first two years of Great Famine in Ireland, there was a disastrous fall in food supplies. Prime Minister Peel called for repeal despite the opposition of most of his Conservative Party. The Anti-Corn Law League played a minor role in the passage of legislation—it had paved the way through its agitation but was now on the sidelines. On 27 January 1846, Peel gave his government&#x27;s plan. He said that the Corn Laws would be abolished on 1 February 1849 after three years of gradual reductions of the tariff, leaving only a 1 shilling duty per quarter. Benjamin Disraeli and Lord George Bentinck emerged as the most forceful opponents of repeal in parliamentary debates, arguing that repeal would weaken landowners socially and politically and therefore destroy the &quot;territorial constitution&quot; of Britain by empowering commercial interests.

On the third reading of Peel&#x27;s Bill of Repeal on 15 May, Members of Parliament (MPs) voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the House of Lords to pass it, and it became the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 22). On that same night Peel&#x27;s Irish Coercion Bill was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by &quot;a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists.&quot; Peel subsequently resigned as Prime Minister. In his resignation speech he attributed the success of repeal to Cobden:
In reference to our proposing these measures, I have no wish to rob any person of the credit which is justly due to him for them. But I may say that neither the gentlemen sitting on the benches opposite, nor myself, nor the gentlemen sitting round me—I say that neither of us are the parties who are strictly entitled to the merit. There has been a combination of parties, and that combination of parties together with the influence of the Government, has led to the ultimate success of the measures. But, Sir, there is a name which ought to be associated with the success of these measures: it is not the name of the noble Lord, the member for London, neither is it my name. Sir, the name which ought to be, and which will be associated with the success of these measures is the name of a man who, acting, I believe, from pure and disinterested motives, has advocated their cause with untiring energy, and by appeals to reason, expressed by an eloquence, the more to be admired because it was unaffected and unadorned—the name which ought to be and will be associated with the success of these measures is the name of Richard Cobden. Without scruple, Sir, I attribute the success of these measures to him.
As a result, the Conservative Party divided and the Whigs formed a government with Russell as PM. Those Conservatives who were loyal to Peel were known as the Peelites and included the Earl of Aberdeen and William Ewart Gladstone. In 1859, the Peelites merged with the Whigs and the Radicals to form the Liberal Party. Disraeli became overall Conservative leader in 1868, although, when Prime Minister, he did not attempt to reintroduce protectionism.

==Motivations==
Scholars have advanced several explanations to resolve the puzzle of why Peel made the seemingly irrational decision to sacrifice his government to repeal the Corn Laws, a policy which he had long opposed. Lusztig (1995) argues that his actions were sensible when considered in the context of his concern for preserving aristocratic government and a limited franchise in the face of threats from popular unrest. Peel was concerned primarily with preserving the institutions of government, and he considered reform as an occasional necessary evil to preclude the possibility of much more radical or tumultuous actions. He acted to check the expansion of democracy by ameliorating conditions which could provoke democratic agitation. He also took care to ensure that the concessions would represent no threat to the British constitution.

According to Dartmouth College economic historian Douglas Irwin, Peel was influenced by economic ideas in his shift from protectionism to free trade in agriculture: &quot;Economic ideas, and not the pressure of interests, were central to Peel&#x27;s conversion to favor repeal of the Corn Laws.&quot;

==Effects of repeal==
The price of wheat during the two decades after 1850 averaged 52 shillings a quarter. Llewellyn Woodward argued that the high duty of corn mattered little because when British agriculture suffered from bad harvests, this was also true for foreign harvests and so the price of imported corn without the duty would not have been lower. However, the threat to British agriculture came about twenty-five years after repeal due to the development of cheaper shipping (both sail and steam), faster and thus cheaper transport by rail and steamboat, and the modernisation of agricultural machinery. The prairie farms of North America were thus able to export vast quantities of cheap grain, as were peasant farms in the Russian Empire with simpler methods but cheaper labour. Every wheat-growing country decided to increase tariffs in reaction to this, except Britain and Belgium.

In 1877, the price of British-grown wheat averaged 56/9 a quarter and for the rest of the 19th century it never reached within 10 shillings of that figure. In 1878 the price fell to 46/5. In 1886, the wheat price decreased to 31/– a quarter. By 1885, wheat-growing land declined by a million acres (, 28% of the previous amount) and the barley area had dwindled greatly also. Britain&#x27;s dependence on imported grain during the 1830s was 2%; during the 1860s it was 24%; during the 1880s it was 45% (for wheat alone during the 1880s it was 65%). The 1881 census showed a decline of 92,250 in agricultural labourers in the ten years since 1871, with an increase of 53,496 urban labourers. Many of these had previously been farm workers who migrated to the cities to find employment, despite agricultural labourers&#x27; wages being higher than those of Europe. Agriculture&#x27;s contribution to the national income was about 17% in 1871; by 1911 it was less than 7%.

Robert Ensor wrote that these years witnessed the ruin of British agriculture, &quot;which till then had almost as conspicuously led the world, [and which] was thrown overboard in a storm like an unwanted cargo&quot; due to &quot;the sudden and overwhelming invasion ... by American prairie-wheat in the late seventies.&quot; Previously, agriculture had employed more people in Britain than any other industry and until 1880 it &quot;retained a kind of headship&quot;, with its technology far ahead of most European farming, its cattle breeds superior, its cropping the most scientific and its yields the highest, with high wages leading to higher standard of living for agricultural workers than in comparable European countries. However, after 1877 wages declined and &quot;farmers themselves sank into ever increasing embarrassments; bankruptcies and auctions followed each other; the countryside lost its most respected figures&quot;, with those who tended the land with greatest pride and conscience suffering most as the only chance of survival came in lowering standards. &quot;For twenty years,&quot; Ensor claimed, &quot;the only chance for any young or enterprising person on the countryside was to get out of it.&quot; The decline of agriculture also led to a fall in rural rents, especially in areas with arable land. Consequently, landowners, who until 1880 had been the richest class in the nation, were dethroned from this position. After they lost their economic leadership, the loss of their political leadership followed.

The Prime Minister at the time, Disraeli, had once been a staunch upholder of the Corn Laws and had predicted ruin for agriculture if they were repealed. However, unlike most other European governments, his government did not revive tariffs on imported cereals to save their farms and farmers. Despite calls from landowners to reintroduce the Corn Laws, Disraeli responded by saying that the issue was settled and that protection was impracticable. Ensor said that the difference between Britain and the Continent was due to the latter having conscription; rural men were thought to be the best suited as soldiers. But for Britain, with no conscript army, this did not apply. He also said that Britain staked its future on continuing to be &quot;the workshop of the world&quot; as the leading manufacturing nation. Robert Blake said that Disraeli was dissuaded from reviving protection due to the urban working class enjoying cheap imported food at a time of industrial depression and rising unemployment. Enfranchised by Disraeli in 1867, working men&#x27;s votes were crucial in a general election and he did not want to antagonise them.

Although proficient farmers on good lands did well, farmers with mediocre skills or marginal lands were at a disadvantage. Many moved to the cities, and unprecedented numbers emigrated. Many emigrants were small under-capitalised grain farmers who were squeezed out by low prices and inability to increase production or adapt to the more complex challenge of raising livestock.

Similar patterns developed in Ireland, where cereal production was labour-intensive. The reduction of grain prices reduced the demand for agricultural labour in Ireland, and reduced the output of barley, oats, and wheat. These changes occurred at the same time that emigration was reducing the labour supply and increasing wage rates to levels too great for arable farmers to sustain.

Britain&#x27;s reliance on imported food led to the danger of it being starved into submission during wartime. In 1914 Britain was dependent on imports for four-fifths of its wheat and 40% of its meat. During the First World War, the Germans in their U-boat campaign attempted to take advantage of this by sinking ships importing food into Britain, but they were eventually defeated. During the Second World War in the Battle of the Atlantic, Germany tried again to starve Britain into surrender, but again was unsuccessful.

<text>The Corporation of Trinity House of Deptford Strond, also known as Trinity House (and formally as The Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Guild Fraternity or Brotherhood of the most glorious and undivided Trinity and of St Clement in the Parish of Deptford Strond in the County of Kent), is the official authority for lighthouses in England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. Trinity House is also responsible for the provision and maintenance of other navigational aids, such as lightvessels, buoys, and maritime radio/satellite communication systems. It is also an official deep sea pilotage authority, providing expert navigators for ships trading in Northern European waters.

Trinity House is also a maritime charity, disbursing funds for the welfare of retired seamen, the training of young cadets and the promotion of safety at sea. For the financial year ending in March 2013, it spent approximately £6.5million in furtherance of its charitable objectives.

Funding for the work of the lighthouse service comes from &quot;light dues&quot; levied on commercial vessels calling at ports in the British Isles, based on their net registered tonnage. The rate is set by the Department for Transport, and reviewed annually. Funding for the maritime charity is generated separately.

The Corporation was founded in 1514, its first Master being Sir Thomas Spert, sailing master of Henry VIII&#x27;s flagship &quot;Mary Rose&quot; and of &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu.&quot;

The corporation came into being in 1514 by Royal Charter granted by Henry VIII under the name &quot;The Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Guild, Fraternity, or Brotherhood of the most glorious and undivided Trinity, and of St Clement in the Parish of Deptford Strond in the County of Kent.&quot; 
The charter came as a result of a petition put forward on 19 March 1513 by a guild of Deptford-based mariners. They were troubled by the poor conduct of unregulated pilots on the Thames and asked the king for licence to regulate pilotage. Sir Thomas Spert, Vice-Admiral of Henry&#x27;s flagship &quot;Mary Rose&quot; and the &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; was elected the first master; the corporation&#x27;s name derives from the Holy Trinity and St. Clement, the patron saint of mariners.

As John Whormby, Clerk to the Corporation, wrote in 1746, their general business was:


Elizabeth I&#x27;s (8 Eliz. 1. c. 13) enabled Trinity House:

With the increasing number of ships lost along the Newcastle to London coal route, Trinity House established the Lowestoft Lighthouse in 1609, a pair of wooden towers with candle illuminants. Until the late 18th century, candle, coal, or wood fires were used as lighthouse illuminants, improved in 1782 with the circular-wick oil-burning Argand lamp, the first ‘catoptric’ mirrored reflector in 1777, and Fresnel’s ‘dioptric’ lens system in 1823. The Nore lightship was established as the world&#x27;s first floating light in 1732.

Trinity House took over the management of all public buoys in the kingdom in 1594 from the Lord High Admiral. A royal warrant, dated 11 June 1594, granted the corporation the right of:
By 1847, revenue collected from this source was £11,000 to £12,000 per year.

In 1836, Trinity House accepted powers in the Lighthouses Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 79) to levy out the last private lighthouse owners and began refurbishing and upgrading its lighthouse estate.

In 1803, the corporation established the Blackwall Depot as a buoy workshop, and six district depots were later established at Harwich, Great Yarmouth, East Cowes, Penzance, Holyhead and Swansea. In December 2002, Trinity House announced that the Great Yarmouth, Penzance and East Cowes depots would close. Today, Trinity House&#x27;s operational headquarters are based at Harwich, supported by depots in Swansea and a flight operations base at St Just in Cornwall. Its operations are also supported by three vessels; the two large tenders THV &quot;Patricia&quot; and THV &quot;Galatea&quot;, and the Rapid Intervention Vessel THV &quot;Alert&quot;. It retains a small secretariat based at Tower Hill.

During the First World War, the corporation served a number of functions: it buoyed shipping lanes and naval operations, moved lightvessels, and laid hundreds of buoys. During the Second World War, Trinity House kept sea lanes marked and lighted for Allied convoys. The Pilotage Service guided ships to their ports under hazardous conditions; at the time of the Dunkirk evacuation, a number of pilots helped in piloting vessels to and from the beaches.

On the night of 29 December 1940, Trinity House was destroyed by the most severe of the air attacks on London; the interiors were completely gutted and many archives and treasures were lost. (The restored building was reopened by Elizabeth II on 21 October 1953.)

In preparation for the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, Trinity House laid 73 lighted buoys and two lightvessels to indicate a safe route for landing craft. Trinity House pilots were responsible for all commercial vessels involved and many of the service vessels. In the month following D-Day, nearly 3,000 vessels were handled by 88 river pilots and nearly 2,000 ships by 115 sea pilots working day and night.

In 1969, Trinity House initiated the debut of helicopter reliefs to and from offshore lighthouses, succeeding the boat reliefs. These had been susceptible to being delayed by months during inclement weather. Trinity House played a major part in the design of the IALA Maritime Buoyage System, laying the first buoy off Dover, watched over by representatives of 16 nations on 15 April 1977.

By the 1960s, Trinity House licensed about 500 pilots, of whom about 350 were in the London District, handling an estimated 60% of the nation&#x27;s piloted tonnage. The Pilotage Act 1987 authorized Trinity House to pass its District Pilotage responsibilities to various local harbour authorities, becoming instead a licensing authority for deep sea pilotage.

The completion of the lighthouse automation programme came with a ceremony held at the North Foreland Lighthouse on 26 November 1998, attended by the last six keepers and master, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. On 9 June 1989, the last crewed lightvessel was towed from the Channel lightvessel station to Harwich.

Richard Woodman served as elder brethren and member of the court from 2000 until his death in 2024. In 2011, the Princess Royal succeeded her father as Master. She was aboard &quot;Trinity House Motor Boat No.1&quot; during the Diamond Jubilee pageant.

In 2014, the Royal Mint issued a two pound coin commemorating the 500th anniversary of the grant of Trinity House&#x27;s royal charter.

From 2011 to 2024, Captain Ian McNaught, a Merchant Navy Officer served as Deputy Master. In 2024, he was succeeded as Deputy Master and Chief Executive by Rear-Admiral Iain Lower.

==Master of the Corporation==

The Master of the Corporation (now an honorary title) is Anne, Princess Royal. Previous Masters of Trinity House include Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Spert, master of the warship &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; under Henry VIII; the diarist Samuel Pepys; William Pitt the Younger; Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington; and Admiral Sir William Penn (father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania).

Other prominent individuals in Britain, often connected with commercial shipping or the Admiralty, have been associated with Trinity House, including Winston Churchill. He gained his status as an Elder Brother of Trinity House as a result of his position as First Lord of the Admiralty before and during the First World War. Often, especially on naval-related forays during the Second World War, Churchill was seen wearing the Trinity House cap or uniform. Churchill also had a Trinity House vessel (THV) named after him, THV &quot;Winston Churchill&quot;.

==Governance==
Trinity House is ruled by a court of thirty-one Elder Brethren, presided over by its Master. These are appointed from 300 Younger Brethren who act as advisors and perform other duties as needed. The Younger Brethren are appointed from lay people with maritime experience, mainly naval officers and ships&#x27; masters, but also harbourmasters, pilots, yachtsmen, and anyone with useful experience.

==Headquarters of the Corporation==
The headquarters of the Corporation are the present Trinity House, which was designed by architect Samuel Wyatt and built in 1796. It has a suite of five state rooms with views over Trinity Square, the Tower of London and the River Thames.

==Trinity High Water==

Trinity High Water (or High Water, Trinity Standard), abbreviated T.H.W., was a vertical datum used for legal purposes in the River Thames and informally over a much wider area. Though not thus defined, it was about above mean sea level.

The concept had its origin in the London Dock Act 1800 (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. xlvii) which authorised the making of the Wapping basin of the London Docks and specified its minimum depth &quot;ie.&quot; over the sill. At that time there was no Ordnance Datum or other accepted vertical benchmark. Therefore, the 1800 Act defined the benchmark for this dock as &quot;the level of the river at low-water mark&quot;. Since opinions about this might vary, it added: 

Accordingly, Trinity House — in the person of Captain Joseph Huddart — set a stone in the external wing wall of the Hermitage Entrance to the London Docks. It was inscribed Similar stones were afterwards set for Wapping and Shadwell entrances.

This established a benchmark which was supposedly extended for further purposes &quot;eg.&quot; the sill heights of other docks and for high water also.

Trinity High Water Mark was much used as a datum in London for legal purposes. It was required to be marked on all drawings of property adjacent to the river when submitted to the Thames Conservancy. As another example, the minimum height of river walls were specified in feet and inches above T.H.W. The benchmark was used in other contexts, such as &quot;Luton is 400 feet above Trinity high-water&quot;; the elevations of water reservoirs; depths in the Geological Survey (London Basin); the depth of an archaeological find; and for railway elevations.

Despite the importance of the Trinity Standard benchmark for legal purposes, it appears that there were discrepancies, some of them grave. Inconsistent standards purporting to be T.H.W. existed. Some stones set by Captain Huddart afterwards could not be found.

Eventually, it was deemed by the Port of London Act 1968 to be a level having a value of above Ordnance Datum Newlyn. and thus the connection with the Trinity House marker stones was abandoned.

==Nautical assessors==
In legal cases involving issues of navigation or seamanship &quot;eg.&quot; collisions at sea, Elder Brethren of Trinity House act as expert nautical advisors to the Admiralty Court in London. Usually, two Elder Brethren sit with the Admiralty judge. Their function is not to decide the case themselves, but to advise the presiding judge about the practicalities of seamanship and ship handling. When this happens, the parties are not allowed to produce expert witnesses of their own without a special reason, since the court considers itself to be well enough advised already. But if one of the colliding ships was a Trinity House vessel, Elder Brethren cannot be employed. Elder Brethren may perform the same functions in appeals.

In a 2020 case about a multiple ship collision in the Suez Canal the Admiralty judge wrote a 306-paragraph judgment ending thus:

==Operational responsibilities and role of the Corporation==
Trinity House has three main functions:
*It is the General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, responsible for a range of general aids to navigation, &#x27;signs of the sea&#x27;, from lighthouses to radar beacons.
*It is a charitable organisation dedicated to the safety, welfare and training of mariners.
*It is a Deep Sea Pilotage Authority, licensing expert navigators to act as deep sea pilots for ships trading in Northern European waters.

The Corporation also inspects buoys provided by local harbour authorities. It no longer provides local pilots for entering ports. Contrary to popular belief, Trinity House is not (and never has been) part of HM Coastguard, although it does work closely with HM Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

Trinity House&#x27;s activities as a lighthouse authority are financed from &quot;light dues&quot; levied on commercial shipping calling at ports in the United Kingdom.

==Assets==

*Lighthouses in England
*Lightvessels in the United Kingdom

===Lighthouses===
Trinity House maintains 65 lighthouses ranging from isolated rock towers like the Eddystone to mainland towers like Southwold lighthouse.

All Trinity House lighthouses have been automated since November 1998, when the UK&#x27;s last staffed lighthouse, North Foreland in Kent, was converted to automatic operation. Lighthouse automation began as long ago as 1910, thanks to an invention of Gustaf Dalén, whose sun valve was fitted in a number of lighthouses powered by acetylene gas. Its vital component was a black metal rod suspended vertically and connected to the gas supply which, as it absorbed the sun&#x27;s heat, the rod expanded downwards, cutting off the gas during the day.

Automation in the modern context began in the early 1980s, made possible firstly by the construction of lantern-top helipads at remote rock lighthouses, to enable the rapid transfer of technicians to a lighthouse in the event of a breakdown, and secondly, by the development of remote control technology, which enables all lighthouses and lightvessels to be monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations and Planning Centre at Harwich, Essex.

The other General Lighthouse Authorities elsewhere in the British Isles are:
*Commissioners of Irish Lights — Ireland (Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland)
*Northern Lighthouse Board (formerly Commissioners of Northern Lights) — Scotland and Man

===Vessels===
====Ships====
Trinity House vessels have the ship prefix THV. three such vessels operate around the coast of England, Wales and the Channel Islands.
*THV &quot;Patricia&quot; (1982) is an multi-functional tender that carries out maintenance work on navigation aids, towing, wreck location and marking. She has a helicopter-landing pad, a 20-tonne main crane and 28-tonne bollard pull and towing winch.
*THV &quot;Alert&quot; (2006) is a Rapid Intervention Vessel, able to respond rapidly to maritime incidents off the southeast coast of England. She is capable of buoy handling, wreck marking and towing. Fitted with multibeam and side-scan hydrographic surveying capability and DP1 dynamic positioning, &quot;Alert&quot; can be utilised as a research platform with a large working deck.
*THV &quot;Galatea&quot; (2007) is an multi-functional tender with a helicopter-landing pad. Fitted with a range of high specification survey equipment and a 30-tonne capacity crane, azimuthing propellers, two 750 kW bow thrusters and DP2 dynamic positioning, &quot;Galatea&quot; replaced the 1987-built THV &quot;Mermaid&quot;.

====Boats====
The Corporation operates a number of small boats, mostly functioning as tenders to Trinity House vessels as described in the section above. The historic right of Trinity House to escort the Sovereign when travelling by ship in territorial waters is still exercised on ceremonial occasions. On the River Thames and inland waterways the duty is carried out by the vessel designated &quot;Trinity House No 1 Boat&quot;, a name which designates any boat assigned to this duty; a tender of THV &quot;Galatea&quot; is used for such ceremonial duties. However, for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012, this boat had the name &quot;T.H. No 1 Boat&quot; painted onto the bow (port and starboard) whilst carrying the Master (the Princess Royal) in the jubilee flotilla. On 8 November 2014, Trinity House entered a float for the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in the City of London, consisting of a heavy low-loader lorry, with the &quot;Trinity House No 1 Boat&quot; mounted on the low-loader trailer as an exhibit.

===Property===
As a charitable body, the corporation has owned a number of properties for benevolent purposes, chief among them the estate at Newington in south London (now rebranded as Trinity Village) and almshouses at Deptford, Mile End, and Walmer; the last of these estates was built in 1958 and remains in use by the corporation today as one of two listed estates: one of predominantly residential buildings at Trinity Village in Borough, London; and a working farm, formerly Booth property, at Goxhill in Lincolnshire. The rents from these properties form a substantial part of the Corporation&#x27;s income.

===Other assets===
Amongst other significant assets, Trinity House operates a helicopter capable of landing on lighthouse and ship landing pads. From May 2011 to November 2015, the aircraft in principal use was an MD Helicopters MD Explorer 902 owned by Police Aviation Services (PAS) and operated under lease. Since December 2015 a Eurocopter EC135 G-GLAA owned and operated by PDG Aviation Services has fulfilled the role.

==Ensign==
The Ensign of Trinity House is a British Red Ensign defaced with the shield of the coat of arms (a St George&#x27;s Cross with a sailing ship in each quarter). The Master and Deputy Master each have their own differenced flags.

When escorting the Sovereign, Trinity House vessels may fly the White Ensign.

<text>Eure ( ; ; or ) is a department in the administrative region of Normandy, northwestern France, named after the river Eure. Its prefecture is Évreux. In 2021, Eure had a population of 598,934.

== History ==
Eure is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Normandy. The name in fact is taken from the Eure river flowing mainly in this department.

After the allied victory at Waterloo, Eure was occupied by Prussian troops between June 1815 and November 1818.

In the wake of Louis-Napoléons December coup of 1851, Eure was one of the departments placed under a state of emergency in order to avert resistance to the post-republican régime. In the event fewer than 100 government opponents in Eure were arrested.

== Geography ==
Eure is part of the current region of Normandy and is surrounded by the departments of Seine-Maritime, Oise, Val-d&#x27;Oise, Yvelines, Eure-et-Loir, Orne, and Calvados. It also has a short coastline within the Atlantic Ocean across the Seine estuary. It is the only Normand department to border the region of Île-de-France.

The department is a largely wooded plateau intersected by the valleys of the river Seine and its tributaries. The altitude varies from sea level in the north to 248 metres above it in the south.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Évreux, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
==Politics==

The President of the Departmental Council is Sébastien Lecornu of La République En Marche!.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

== Tourism ==

The Abbey of Bec and the Château-Gaillard near Les Andelys are other important tourist attractions.

The Château of Buisson de May was built by the royal architect Jacques Denis Antoine from 1781 to 1783.

Eure-et-Loir is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790 pursuant to the Act of December 22, 1789. It was created mainly from parts of the former provinces of Orléanais (Beauce) and Maine (Perche), but also parts of Île-de-France (Drouais, Thymerais, Valley of the Avre, Hurepoix).

The current department corresponds to the central part of the land of the Carnutes who had their capital at Autricum (Chartres). The Carnutes are known for their commitment, real or imagined, to the ancient Druidic religion. In the north of the department another pre-Roman people, the little-known Durocasses, had their capital at Dreux.

<text>Gard () is a department in Southern France, located in the region of Occitanie. It had a population of 748,437 as of 2019; its prefecture is Nîmes. 

The department is named after the river Gardon. In recent decades of the 21st century, local administration and French speakers have returned to the original Occitan name of the river, Gard (). It is part of a revival of Occitan culture.

== History ==

In classical times the Gard area was settled by Romans and their allies. They built the Via Domitia across the region in 118 BC. Centuries later, on 4 March 1790, Gard was one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution. It comprised the ancient province of Languedoc.

Originally this department was to include the canton of Ganges, but Ganges was transferred to the neighbouring department of Hérault. In return, Gard was assigned the fishing port of Aigues Mortes, which gave the department its own outlet to the Gulf of Lion on the Mediterranean Sea.

During the middle of the nineteenth century the prefecture, traditionally a centre of commerce with a manufacturing sector focused on textiles, was an early beneficiary of railway development, becoming an important railway junction. Several luxurious hotels were built, and the improved market access provided by the railways also encouraged, initially, a rapid growth in wine growing. But many winegrowers were ruined when the vineyards were infected with phylloxera in 1872.

== Geography ==

Gard is part of the region of Occitanie and is surrounded by the departments of Hérault, Lozère, Aveyron, Bouches-du-Rhône, Vaucluse and Ardèche. It has a short coastline to the south on the Mediterranean Sea. The highest point in the department is Mont Aigoual. 

In the first quarter of the 21st century, the department has suffered serious flooding. The region has also been subject to some of the highest recorded temperatures in France&#x27;s history as climate change alters summer heat.

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1791:

The inhabitants of Gard are called &quot;Gardois&quot;. The most populous commune is Nîmes, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are eight communes that have more than 10,000 inhabitants each:

==Politics==
In the closely contested first round of the 2012 presidential election, Gard was the only department to vote for the National Front candidate Marine Le Pen by a slim plurality, with 25.51% of the vote. The incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy of the Union for a Popular Movement party received 24.86% of the vote, while Socialist candidate François Hollande received 24.11% of the vote share.

===Departmental Council===

The President of the Departmental Council has been Françoise Laurent-Perrigot of the Socialist Party (PS) since 2021.

===Members of the National Assembly===
In the 2022 legislative election, Gard elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

== Tourism ==
Gard contains a part of the Cévennes National Park. There are important Roman architectural remains in Nîmes, as well as the famous Roman aqueduct, the Pont du Gard.

Gard is also home to the source of Perrier, a carbonated mineral water sold both in France and internationally on a large scale. The spring and facility are located just south-east of the commune of Vergèze.

<text>Gers (; or , ) is a department in the region of Occitania, Southwestern France. Gers is bordered by the departments of Hautes-Pyrénées and Pyrénées-Atlantiques to the south, Haute-Garonne and Tarn-et-Garonne to the east, Lot-et-Garonne to the north and Landes to the west. Named after the Gers River, its inhabitants are called the &quot;Gersois&quot; and &quot;Gersoises&quot; in French. In 2019, it had a population of 191,377.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the Lordship of L&#x27;Isle-Jourdain was nearby.

Gers is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Guyenne and Gascony. In 1808 it lost Lavit on its north-eastern side to the newly created department of Tarn-et-Garonne.

==Culture==
The culture is largely agricultural, with great emphasis on the local gastronomical specialties such as:

* Armagnac brandy;
* Côtes de Gascogne;
* Floc de Gascogne;
* Foie gras;
* Wild mushrooms.

Also, some prominent cultivated crops are corn, colza, sunflowers and grain.

The Gascon language is a dialect of Occitan, but it is not widely spoken. The department is characterised by sleepy bastide villages and rolling hills with the Pyrenees visible to the south. Alexandre Dumas, père created the famous Gersois d&#x27;Artagnan, the fourth musketeer of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. A museum to d&#x27;Artagnan is found in the Gersois village of Lupiac.

A horse race at the Auteuil Hippodrome has been named after André Boingnères, a notable local race-horse owner and the successful Mayor of Termes-d&#x27;Armagnac between 1951 and 1976.

<text>Ille-et-Vilaine (; Gallo: &quot;Ill-e-Vilaenn&quot;, ) is a department of France, located in the region of Brittany in the northwest of the country. It is named after its two main rivers, the Ille and the Vilaine. It had a population of 1,079,498 in 2019.

== History ==
Ille-et-Vilaine is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the province of Brittany.

== Geography ==
Ille-et-Vilaine is a part of the current region of Brittany and it is bordered by the departments of Manche to the north-east, Mayenne to the east, Maine-et-Loire to the south-east, Loire-Atlantique to the south, Morbihan to the south-west, and Côtes-d&#x27;Armor to the west and north-west – France&#x27;s shortest administrative department boundary at 20 yards (19 metres), although this was not the case with the department boundary. Also the English Channel (&quot;la Manche&quot; in French) borders the department to the north.

The department is named after its two main rivers, the Ille and the Vilaine, whose confluence is in Rennes, the capital of the department and of the region. Other important rivers include:
* the Rance, that borders the department in the north-west and flows to the north, creating a deep fjord before reaching the English Channel on the western part of the coast (named Côte d&#x27;Émeraude) between the cities of Dinard and Saint-Malo); the Rance river is connected from the west of the department to the Ille river in the north-west suburbs of Rennes with a navigable channel (then the Ille river is channelized to join the Vilaine up to the center of the city of Rennes);
* and the Couesnon that borders the eastern part of the department and which reaches the eastern part of the coast of the English Channel, in the flat &quot;Bay of the Mont Saint-Michel&quot;.

The department is moderately elevated above the level of the sea, with many hills; however the central part has a dense network of many tributaries to the Ille or the Vilaine from all around the large basin of Rennes. The elevated hills bordering this basin are covered by several old forests now exploited by men for the production of wood. The basin itself is a rich agriculture area, as well as the north-west of the department near the Rance.

In the extreme south of the department the Vilaine goes through a slower decrease in elevation in a small corridor in the area of the city of Redon; in this area, the Vilaine is known for its frequent floods during its recent history, often because of too-intensive draining of agricultural areas around Rennes (some floods also affected some parts of Rennes up to the 1980s due to incorrect management of old equipment of the canal of Ille-et-Rance). To avoid these hazards within inhabited cities, some natural fields bordering the Vilaine in the south of the department are now left floodable, and works for regulating the level have been done including, small artificial lakes with derivation channels, replanting trees in the basin, better management of forests, and regulating the artificial drains made for agriculture.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Rennes, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
The population has grown rapidly over the last few decades and was estimated at 1,051,779 in January 2016.

Population development since 1801:
== Language ==
Gallo is a historic minority language spoken in eastern Brittany. Gallo and Breton are both studied at the University of Rennes.

=== Breton ===
Historically, the Breton language was little spoken in the eastern part of Brittany, and this was one of the first regions where the language disappeared such that Breton was not spoken for many centuries.

Today, Breton is again spoken due to schools teaching Breton, and due to a small immigration from Western Brittany to Eastern Brittany, where there are more cities with growing industries and external investment and therefore more work. A recent study shows that Breton speakers in this region represent 3.3% of the total number of Breton speakers. The Breton speakers aged 18–30 in this region represent 12.7% of the total number of Breton speakers of that age group. This is because there are relatively few elder speakers but many people are learning the language. The study says that about 1,800 people are learning it (this includes one Diwan school in Rennes, some bilingual public and catholic schools, and evening courses).

==Politics==

The President of the Departmental Council is the Socialist Jean-Luc Chenut since the 2015 French departmental elections, re-elected in 2021.

The city of Rennes and its suburbs are the original base of the rapid Socialist growth in the department. The city has been governed by Socialist Mayors since 1977, notably by Edmond Hervé between 1977 and 2008. Since then, the growth of middle-class suburbs have helped the Socialists, who have been rapidly gaining strength in those formerly right-leaning areas.

The right remains strong in a strongly Catholic (clerical) area from outside Redon to Vitré or Fougères. In addition, the right is strong in the wealthy coastal area of Saint-Malo and Dinard.

<text>Indre (); is a department in central France named after the river Indre. The inhabitants of the department are known as the &quot;Indriens&quot; (masculine; ) and &quot;Indriennes&quot; (feminine; ). Indre is part of the current administrative region of Centre-Val de Loire. The region is bordered by the departments of Indre-et-Loire to the west, Loir-et-Cher to the north, Cher to the east, Creuse and Haute-Vienne to the south, and Vienne to the southwest. The préfecture (capital) is Châteauroux and there are three subpréfectures at Le Blanc, La Châtre and Issoudun. It had a population of 219,316 in 2019. It also contains the geographic centre of Metropolitan France.

==History==

Indre is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, by order of the National Constituent Assembly. The new departments were to be uniformly administered and approximately equal in size and population to one another. The department was created from parts of the former provinces of Berry, Orléanais, La Marche and Touraine.

Before the Roman conquest, the Celtic Bituriges tribe occupied an area that included Indre, Cher, and part of Limousin. Their capital was Avaricum (Bourges), and another important settlement was at Argenton-sur-Creuse. The area then became part of Roman Gaul after its conquest by Julius Caesar around 58 BC, and enjoyed a period of stability. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the Frankish tribes living in Gaul were united under the Merovingians, and succeeded in conquering most of the country in the sixth century AD. From this time, the Franks controlled most of Gaul and the Carolingian Empire was the last stage of their rule. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak with the crowning of Charlemagne and after his death in 814, it began to fragment. The Carolingian territories were divided into three sections in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun, and the area that is now the department of Indre, became part of West Francia. In 869, the king of Middle Francia died without leaving a legitimate heir, and eventually part of that kingdom was added to West Francia to effectively form the medieval Kingdom of France.

A castle was built at Châteauroux in the late tenth century. In the eleventh century, the lords of Châteauroux were powerful in the region; their &quot;principality&quot; covered two thirds of the current Department of Indre and they had their own coinage.

==Geography==
Indre is a department in central France and is part of the region of Centre-Val de Loire. The capital and largest town in the department is Châteauroux. To the north of Indre lies Loir-et-Cher, to the east Cher, to the south lies Creuse and Haute-Vienne, to the southwest lies Vienne, and to the northwest lies Indre-et-Loire. Most of the department is relatively level plains in the broad Loire Valley.

The area of the department is and it is some from north to south and some wide. The land is undulating and slopes gently towards the northwest. The main rivers are the Creuse, the Claise and the Indre. The Creuse, a tributary of the Vienne, is long and has been impounded in several places; at the time it was built in 1926, the Eguzon Dam was the largest dam in Europe. The Claise is long and is a tributary of the Creuse. The Indre is a longer waterway and flows centrally through the department from south to north, through the major towns of La Châtre, Châteauroux and Loches. It is a tributary of the Loire, joining it at Chinon in the neighbouring department of Loir-et-Cher.

Indre is divided into four natural regions; North Boischaut is undulating land with an altitude between and occupies the northeast of the department, South Boischaut is hilly and lies in the south and southeast, a marshy tract of land known as Brenne is in the southwestern part of the department, and the flat, dry, flinty limestone plateau of Champagne berrichonne is in the east and continues into Cher. The highest point of the department is near the town of Pouligny-Notre-Dame where the land rises to above sea level. The department is made up of of land of which are under arable cropping, are grassland, are woodland, are under grapes and are gardens and orchards. The remaining land is heathland, urban land and waterways.

The economy is mostly agricultural. In the past many sheep were raised in the department and woollen yarn was the main manufactured product. There is also a linen industry as well as the manufacture of hosiery and paper. The department has some minerals in the form of coal, iron, stone, marble and clay.

Châteauroux, the capital of the department, is a historic town. It was originally called &quot;Château Raoul&quot;, the present day château which now houses the préfecture being built on the site of a castle constructed in the tenth century by Raoul le Large, lord of Déols. In 1188 the castle was held by Philippe Auguste who was concerned in protecting the drapery business centred in the town and along the banks of the River Indre from fraud. From 1612 to 1736 it was a duchy of the House of Condé and from 1742 to 1744 was under the control of the Marquise de la Tournelle. 
The Indre department has two villages which have been classified among the most beautiful villages of France: Saint-Benoît-du-Sault and Gargilesse-Dampierre.

<text>Jura ( , ) is a department in the eastern French region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. The department takes its name from the Jura Mountains. Its prefecture is Lons-le-Saunier; subprefectures are Dole and Saint-Claude. In 2019, Jura had a population of 259,199. Its INSEE code is 39. It has a short portion of the border of Switzerland.

==History==
Historically, Jura belonged to the Free County of Burgundy, known in French as the Franche-Comté. Dole was the capital until the region was conquered by Louis XIV and the capital was moved to Besançon. Dole is now a &quot;sous-préfecture&quot;, or sub-prefecture, of Jura.

As early as the 13th century, inhabitants of the southern two-thirds of Jura spoke a dialect of Arpitan language. It continued to be spoken in rural areas into the 20th century.

Jura is one of the original 83 French departments, created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was established from part of the former province of Franche-Comté. The prefecture is Lons-le-Saunier.

==Demographics==
Population development since 1801:

===Principal towns===
The most populous commune is Dole; the prefecture Lons-le-Saunier is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are five communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

== Geography ==
Jura is one of eight départements of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region and is surrounded by the French départements of Doubs, Haute-Saône, Côte-d&#x27;Or, Saône-et-Loire, and Ain, as well as the Swiss canton of Vaud on the east.

The Jura mountains are wooded and rolling, not craggy and rocky like the Alps.

Many lakes can be found throughout the Jura, the largest natural lake being Lac de Chalain, measuring 3 km long and 1 km wide. Lac de Vouglans was formed after the building of a hydro-electric dam. It is one of the largest man-made lakes in France.

==Politics==
===Departmental politics===
The President of the Departmental Council has been Clément Pernot (miscellaneous right) since 2015.

===Members of the National Assembly===
In the 2024 legislative election, Jura elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

== Climate ==
The climate of the Jura varies greatly by elevation. The lower valleys are temperate and pleasant, but the high mountain valleys have bitterly cold winters.

== Economy ==
Jura is a wine-growing region. The Jura wines are very distinctive and unusual wines, such as vin jaune, which is made by a similar process to sherry, developing under a flor of yeast. This is made from the local Savagnin grape variety. Other grape varieties include Poulsard, Trousseau, and Chardonnay.

The département contains no industrial cities: the few towns function as administrative and commercial centres serving Jura&#x27;s rural economy. In the absence of large-scale industrial enterprises, small artisanal businesses play an important role. The Jura CFA &quot;(Centre for apprenticeship and training)&quot; recently recorded 752 current apprenticeships in trades such as building, baking, butchery, hair dressing, car repairing, sales and other non-factory based occupations.

== Tourism ==
The Jura mountains provide ample opportunities for hiking, skiing, as well as other winter sports.

The department, which has its prefecture in Le Puy-en-Velay, covers the upper reaches of the Loire and consists of the Loire Valley and the surrounding mountains in the Massif Central. It is one of the original 83 departments of France created in 1790 during the French Revolution. Parts of the department are included in the Livradois-Forez Regional Natural Park.

==History==
The first known inhabitants of this region were hunter-gatherers and it was later occupied by pastoralists, shepherds living in caves or simple huts. It later came under the control of a Gaulish tribe called Vellavi and at the time of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars, this area lay on the border of Gallia Narbonensis. The area became a Roman province in 121 BC, originally under the name &quot;Gallia Transalpina&quot; (Transalpine Gaul). The name distinguished it from Cisalpine Gaul on the near side of the Alps to Rome. In 40 BC, during the Second Triumvirate, Lepidus was given responsibility for Narbonese Gaul (along with Hispania and Africa), while Mark Antony was given the balance of Gaul.

The area was ravaged by barbarian invasions in the last years of the Roman Empire, and &quot;Galla Narbonensis&quot; and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Visigothic Kingdom between 462 and 477 AD, permanently ending the political control of Rome. After the Gothic takeover, the Visigothic dominions were generally known as Septimania. The king of the Visigoths, Alaric I was killed at the Battle of Vouillé in 507, a battle won by Clovis I and Velay came under Frankish rule. On Clovis&#x27; death in 511, his kingdom was divided among his four sons, and Velay was included in the part of the king of Austrasia, then part of the French kingdom. These subdivisions were united under the auspices of his longest surviving son Chlothar I, only to be split again under his four sons at his death. It was reunited once more under Chlothar II who became the sole ruler of the Frankish people in 613.

In about 928, the area became a fiefdom of the Count of Toulouse, and later came under the control of the Count of Poitiers. In 1137, Eleanor of Aquitaine succeeded to the Duchy of Aquitaine and her marriage to Henry, Duke of Normandy, who later became Henry II of England, brought Auvergne under English rule. By the end of the thirteenth century the area was known as the Dauphiné d’Auvergne.

Haute-Loire is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, by order of the National Constituent Assembly. The new departments were to be uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in size and population. Haute-Loire was formed from parts of the former provinces of Auvergne, Languedoc, and Lyonnais. Two thirds of the department, centred on Le Puy-en-Velay, used to be part of the former province of Languedoc and is known as Velay. The geographical distance from Toulouse had allowed this region to enjoy a great deal of autonomy.

During the Second World War, French partisans aided by Allied supply drops and leaders were able to liberate the province from Germans. By mid-August 1944 five weeks after the invasion at Normandy, Le Puy-en-Velay was besieged. Roads, railroad and telephone lines were cut. On 18 August, the Germans attempted to escape in a fifty-truck convoy. Five hundred were captured, and about 150 killed in a massive ambush. The town fell the next day. Estivareilles in nearby Loire fell on 22 August. Paris was captured by conventional forces on 24 August.

==Geography==
Haute-Loire is a department in south central France and is part of the region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. The capital and largest town in the department is Le Puy-en-Velay. To the north of Haute-Loire lie Puy-de-Dôme and Loire, to the east lies Ardèche, to the south lies Lozère and to the west lies Cantal. The river Loire rises in the southern part of the department and flows northwards, creating a wide valley. On either side of this lie ranges of mountains in the Massif Central. The north part of the department is part of the Livradois-Forez Regional Natural Park, a protected area of traditionally-farmed agricultural land and woodland, covering a total area of .

The department has four mountain ranges running north and south. These are the Haut-Vivarais and its continuation, the Boutières range, the Massif du Meygal, the Velay mountains and the Margeride Mountains.

The highest point of the department is the Mont Mézenc (1753 m) and its average elevation is 719 m. The two-thirds of the area is over 800 m and the lowest point is 393 m.

Historically, Velay has been associated with the traditional region of Vivarais, now part of Ardèche. The two regions share a common dialect which is similar to that spoken in the south of Dauphiné, the reason probably being associated with the trade links between the two regions.

==Demographics==
===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Le Puy-en-Velay, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Notable people==
Claude-Jean Allouez (1622–1689) was born in Saint-Didier-en-Velay. He was a Jesuit missionary and explorer in North America who is said to have converted ten thousand Native Americans. The town of Allouez, Wisconsin is named after him. The de Polignac family has its historic seat in the department, and various descendants of General Lafayette were senators for this region in the nineteenth century. The black metal band Peste Noire comes from the city La Chaise-Dieu. The Château de Chavaniac, located in the commune, was the birthplace of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in 1757. Originally named Chavaniac, the commune was renamed Chavaniac-Lafayette in 1884 in honor of its most famous resident.

==Tourism==
The department has attractive landscapes and is popular with tourists. Le Puy-en-Velay has a historic cathedral at which pilgrims gather before starting their journey to Santiago de Compostela. The cathedral has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1998, as part of the &quot;Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France&quot;. Another site of pilgrimage is at Saint Michel d&#x27;Aiguilhe, a twelfth century chapel on top of a rocky pinnacle approached by a flight of 268 steps.

<text>Loire-Atlantique (; Gallo: &quot;Louére-Atantique&quot;; ; before 1957: &quot;Loire-Inférieure&quot;, ) is a department in Pays de la Loire on the west coast of France, named after the river Loire and the Atlantic Ocean. It had a population of 1,429,272 in 2019.

==History==
Loire-Atlantique is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790. Originally, it was named Loire-Inférieure, but its name was changed in March 9, 1957 to Loire-Atlantique.

The area is part of the historical Duchy of Brittany, and contains what many people still consider to be Brittany&#x27;s capital, Nantes. However, during World War II, the Vichy Government set up a system of regional prefectures whereby on 19 April 1941 Loire-Atlantique was excluded from the Region of Brittany and united with neighbouring French departments, under the lead of Angers.

After the war these administrative changes were reimplemented in the 1955 boundary changes intended to optimise the management of the regions. There has since been a series of campaigns reflecting a strong local mood to have the department reintegrated with Brittany.

==Geography==
Loire-Atlantique is part of the current region of Pays de la Loire and is surrounded by the department of Morbihan, Ille-et-Vilaine, Maine-et-Loire, and Vendée, with the Atlantic on the west.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Nantes, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 9 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Culture==

Upper Brittany&#x27;s indigenous language is Gallo, a romance language related to French. The number of Gallo language speakers has been in steady decline since the early 20th century. The language is neither official nor taught in primary or secondary education. In the south of the &quot;département&quot; (Pays de Retz), the local language was Poitevin dialect.

The Breton language, a Celtic language, native to Lower Brittany, was historically spoken in the western area of Loire-Atlantique, and up to 1920 in Batz-sur-Mer. This area (Guérande, Le Croisic, and La Baule) has a rather Breton toponymy: for instance, &quot;Guérande&quot; originates from the Breton &quot;Gwenn Rann&quot; (white or pure place).

The folklore and musical traditions of eastern or Upper Brittany are generally similar to those of western or Lower Brittany.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Michel Menard, elected in July 2021.

===Current Deputies of the National Assembly===

=== Current Senators ===

=== Political movements ===
The capital of the administrative region is Rennes, although Nantes is considered the capital of historic Brittany and is located in Loire-Atlantique. The reunification of historic Brittany is supported by a majority of Loire-Atlantique and is considered a prerequisite to further autonomy of Brittany as a whole.

==Transport==

The &quot;département&quot; operates the Lila network (fr) of interurban buses, which link its villages, towns and cities. The urban areas of Nantes and Saint-Nazaire operate their own urban transport networks, known as TAN and STRAN (fr) respectively.

By rail, the regional trains and buses of the TER Pays de la Loire link major towns and cities of the Pays de la Loire and adjoining regions, including those of the &quot;département&quot;. Nantes is on the TGV network, with high speed trains running to Paris by the LGV Atlantique in just over 2 hours.

Nantes Atlantique Airport, located 8 km to the southwest of the city of Nantes, serves the &quot;département&quot; and surrounding areas. It is the biggest airport in northwestern France, linking with several French, North African and European cities, as well as Montreal in Canada.

<text>Haute-Garonne (; , ; Upper Garonne) is a department in the southwestern French region of Occitanie. Named after the river Garonne, which flows through the department. Its prefecture and main city is Toulouse, the country&#x27;s fourth-largest. In 2019, it had a population of 1,400,039.

==History==

Haute-Garonne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the former provinces of Languedoc and Guyenne/Gascony.

The department was originally larger. The reduction in its area resulted from an imperial decree dated 21 November 1808 and which established the neighbouring department of Tarn-et-Garonne, to the north. The new department took territory from five surrounding departments including Haute-Garonne. The districts lost to Tarn-et-Garonne in 1808 were those of Montech and Castelsarrasin.

==Geography==

Haute-Garonne is part of the current region of Occitanie and is surrounded by the departments of Hautes-Pyrénées, Gers, Tarn-et-Garonne, Tarn, Aude, and Ariège. It also borders Spain in the south (province of Lleida and province of Huesca). According to the Köppen climate classification, the department has a mix of humid subtropical, oceanic, subarctic, and polar climates.

The department is crossed by the upper course of the Garonne river (hence the name) for nearly . The borders of the department follow the river. The Garonne enters France from Spain at the town of Fos, and goes through Toulouse and leaves the department. The extreme south of the department lies in the Pyrenees mountain range and is very mountainous. The highest elevation is the Peak of Perdiguère, at above sea level.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Haut-Garonnais&quot;. The greatest population concentration is around Toulouse, in the north, while the southern area of the department is sparsely populated. Overall the department had a population of 1.4 million as of the 2019 census, with 55% of the population under the age of 40, and 16% between the ages of 20 and 29, and only 45% of the population is over the age 40. This youthful demographic is due in part to Toulouse being a major university town. The department has also seen significant migration from other parts of the country.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Toulouse, the prefecture. As of 2019, there were eight communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==
This department was the political base of former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

===Departmental Council of Haute-Garonne===
The Departmental Council of Haute-Garonne comprises 54 seats. In the 2015 departmental elections, the Socialist Party (PS) won 48 seats. The Republicans secured the remaining 6 seats. The President of the Departmental Council has been Georges Méric (PS) since 2015.

===Members of the National Assembly===
Haute-Garonne elected the following members of the National Assembly during the 2017 legislative election:

<doc id="90581" wikidata="Q12574" url="?curid=90581" title="Loiret">
<text>Loiret (; ) is a department in the Centre-Val de Loire region of north-central France. It takes its name from the river Loiret, which is contained wholly within the department. In 2019, Loiret had a population of 680,434.

Its prefecture is Orléans, which is about southwest of Paris. As well as being the regional prefecture, it is a historic city on the banks of the Loire. It has a large central area with many historic buildings and mansions. Orléans Cathedral, dating back to the 13th century, was rebuilt after Protestant forces destroyed it in 1568. Loiret has two subprefectures, in Montargis and Pithiviers. It is famous for its several châteaux.

==History==

Loiret is one of the original 83 departments that was created during the French Revolution on March 4, 1790, by order of the National Constituent Assembly. The new departments were to be uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in size and population. It was created from the former province of Orléanais which was too large to continue in its previous form.

The Loire Valley was occupied in Palaeolithic times as attested by numerous archaeological sites in the department. The Celts were here, bringing crafts and trades, and the Romans occupied the area after the Gallic Wars. They built roads and founded cities such as Cenabum, on the site of present-day Orléans, and Sceaux-du-Gâtinais. Around 451, the Huns invaded the region but were repelled before reaching Cenabum. The Franks reached the Loire and Clovis I reigned in the area. A time of peace and prosperity ensued during the reign of Charlemagne.

==Geography==
Loiret is one of six departments in the region Centre-Val de Loire. To the north of Loiret lie the departments of Eure-et-Loir, Essonne and Seine-et-Marne, to the east lies Yonne, to the southeast Nièvre, to the south Cher, and to the west Loir-et-Cher.

The department consists of mostly flat low-lying land through which flows the river Loire. This river enters the department near Châtillon-sur-Loire in the southeast, flows northwestwards to Orleans where it turns to flow south west, leaving the department near Beaugency. The Canal d&#x27;Orléans connects the Loire at Orléans to a junction with the Canal du Loing and the Canal de Briare in the village of Buges near Montargis. The Loire and these canals formed important trading routes before the arrival of the railways. The river Loiret, after which the department is named, is long and joins the Loire southwest of Orléans. Its source is at Orléans-la-Source, and its mouth at Saint-Hilaire-Saint-Mesmin. Other rivers in the department, are the Loing, a right-bank tributary of the Loire, and the Ouanne which flows into the Loing.

The department has a total area of and is from west to east and from north to south. Large parts of the land are used for agriculture, and these are separated by low wooded hills and some forested areas. The northwestern part of the department is in the wheat-growing region known as Beauce, an undulating plateau with some of France&#x27;s best agricultural land. This area was popular with the French aristocracy in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period, and there are many historic châteaux in the department including Château d&#x27;Augerville, Château de Bellegarde, Château de Gien, Château du Hallier, Château de Meung-sur-Loire, Château de Sully-sur-Loire and Château de Trousse-Barrière.

The part of the department south of the Loire is known as the Sologne and is an area of heathland and marshland, interspersed by hills where vines are grown. The eastern part of the department is known as Gâtinais and was part of a province of that name. Until the beginning of the 21st century, it used to be renowned for the production of saffron, but the crop could not be mechanised, and production dwindled as the cost of production became too high.

==Demography==

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Orléans, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants, all of which are part of the agglomeration of Orléans:

==Economy==
Of the of land in the department, are arable, are vines, are pasture, are forested, are plantations and orchards and are unproductive moorland and heathland. The soil is in general fertile and productive; the Beauce is the main wheat-growing region, oats are widely cultivated and rye is also grown. Other crops include fruit, asparagus, saffron and herbs. Vines are cultivated and wine produced, and the area is noted for its fruit preservation. Bee-keeping also takes place and honey is produced. Loiret has little industrial development, and commerce is centred about the sale of corn, timber, cattle, chestnuts, cider, honey, flour, fruits, fish, salt, saffron and wool. The only minerals extracted are stone, limestone, marl and clay.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Marc Gaudet, elected in 2017.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Transport==
The department benefits from its proximity to Paris to which it has good transport links. Orléans does not yet have a TGV but is connected to Paris via fast express trains. The A71 autoroute links Paris with Orléans and Clermont-Ferrand, the A10 autoroute links Paris with Orléans and Bordeaux, and the Route nationale 20 links Paris with Orléans, Limoges, Toulouse and Spain.

==Tourism==
Orléans is a popular tourist destination and is associated with Joan of Arc. The Cathedral of Sainte-Croix was built in the Gothic style between 1278 and 1329, destroyed by Protestant forces in 1568, and rebuilt between the 17th and 19th centuries.

<text>Lot-et-Garonne (, ) is a department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of Southwestern France. Named after the rivers Lot and Garonne, it had a population of 331,271 in 2019. Its prefecture and largest city is Agen.

==History==
Lot-et-Garonne is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790, as a result of the French Revolution. It was created from part of the province of Guyenne and Gascony; originally the territory of the ancient county of Agenais constituted nearly the whole.

The southeastern part of the original department (the former cantons of Auvillar, Montaigu-de-Quercy and Valence) was separated from it in 1808 to become a part of the newly created department of Tarn-et-Garonne.

<text>Meurthe-et-Moselle () is a &quot;département&quot; in the Grand Est region of France, named after the rivers Meurthe and Moselle. Its prefecture and largest city is Nancy and it borders the departments of Meuse to the west, Vosges to the south, Moselle and Bas-Rhin and it borders the Belgian province of Luxembourg and the country of Luxembourg by the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette to the north. It had a population of 733,760 in 2019.

== History ==

Meurthe-et-Moselle was created in 1871 at the end of the Franco-Prussian War from the parts of the former departments of Moselle and Meurthe which remained French territory.

The current boundary between Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle was the border between France and Germany from 1871 to 1919 and again between 1940 and 1944. The only subsequent change took place in 1997 and involved the incorporation, for administrative reasons, of the little commune of Han-devant-Pierrepont which had previously fallen within the Meuse department.

== Geography ==

Meurthe-et-Moselle is part of the administrative region of Grand Est and the traditional region of Lorraine and is surrounded by the departments of Meuse, Vosges, Bas-Rhin, and Moselle, and by the nations of Luxembourg and Belgium by the salient of the arrondissement of Val-de-Briey. It is one of two departments in France which border with Luxembourg. Parts of Meurthe-et-Moselle belong to the Lorraine Regional Natural Park.

The department extends for 130 km from north to south and is between 7 and 103 km wide.

Its chief rivers are the Moselle, the Meurthe, the Chiers, and the Vezouze.

== Economy ==
The economy was highly dependent on mining until the 1960s. There are iron, salt, and lime extraction sites. The urban area around Nancy has an economy based largely on services, research, and higher education.

== Demographics ==
The inhabitants of the department are known as &quot;Meurthe-et-Mosellans&quot;. The area around Nancy has become highly urbanized, whereas the Saintois in the south is quite rural.

<doc id="90584" wikidata="Q12620" url="?curid=90584" title="Mayenne">
<text>Mayenne ( ) is a landlocked department in northwest France named after the river Mayenne. Mayenne is part of the administrative region of Pays de la Loire and is surrounded by the departments of Manche, Orne, Sarthe, Maine-et-Loire, and Ille-et-Vilaine.

Mayenne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. The northern two thirds correspond to the western part of the former province of Maine. The southern third of Mayenne corresponds to the northern portion of the old province of Anjou. The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Mayennais&quot;. It had a population of 307,062 in 2019.

==History==
Like 82 other departments, Mayenne was created on 4 March 1790 during the early stages of the French Revolution by order of the National Constituent Assembly. The new departments were to be uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in size and population. The former province of Maine was partitioned into two, Upper Maine, centred on Le Mans, became the new department of Sarthe, and Lower Maine, centred on Laval became the new department of Mayenne. Anjou, to the south, being too big to form a single department, was reduced in size and became Maine-et-Loire. In this partition, Sarthe received the region of La Flèche, and Mayenne received Château-Gontier and Craon. Flax was a feature of the Mayenne economy, and the southern limit for the cultivation of flax was used to determine the new border between Mayenne and Maine-et-Loire.

The American first army&#x27;s 90th Infantry Division were tasked with capturing the town in 1944.

==Geography==
Mayenne is a department in northwestern France and is part of the region of Pays de la Loire. The department does not have a sea coast, but about thirty kilometres to the northwest is Mont Saint-Michel Bay. The capital and largest town is Laval in the centre of the department. To the north lies the department of Orne, to the east lies Sarthe, to the south lies Maine-et-Loire, to the west lies Ille-et-Vilaine and to the northwest lies Manche. The department forms a roughly rectangular shape, being long by wide, with a total area of about . The river Mayenne flows centrally through it from north to south, passing through the towns of Mayenne, Laval and Château-Gontier. After leaving the department, the river joins the river Sarthe to form the Maine which later joins the Loire.

The department is varied in topography. Much of it is largely flat, but there are also hilly areas, some with steep-sided valleys and ravines. Of the total area of , some are arable, are grassland, are forests and woodland and are heathland and moorland. To the north lies the Armorican Massif, a plateau that has been eroded over time, the highest summit of which, the Mont des Avaloirs, is the highest point in the department at above sea level. A branch range to the south of this plateau forms the ridge that divides the Mayenne Valley from the Vilaine Valley.

The department is subdivided into three arrondissements: Mayenne, Laval, and Château-Gontier; and is coincident with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Laval.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Laval, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 7,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Olivier Richefou, elected in 2014.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Flora and fauna==
Mayenne has a diversity of habitat types such as forest, heathland, bog and farmland. Some 1445 species of plants, 63 species of mammals, 280 species of birds, 16 species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles have been recorded, as well as thousands of species of invertebrates. The peat-lands and bogs are often fringed with woodlands of alder and ash, and in some places carnivorous plants such as sundew and butterwort flourish, fritillaries, marsh cinquefoil and cottongrass grow and butterflies, dragonflies and spiders abound.

The woodlands are mostly small with the deciduous trees dominated by oak. Here roe deer, badger, fire salamander, Aesculapian snake, middle spotted woodpecker, little owl and white admiral can be found and uncommon plants present including European columbine and wild russet apple.

The dry grasslands, which cover the limestone and sandstone soils, are also rich in fauna and flora. They house the snake &quot;Vipera aspis&quot;, the Large blue butterfly, the blue-winged grasshopper and the bee orchid. The heathland in the north of Mayenne is populated by dwarf gorse and cross-leaved heath and there are plenty of spiders, nightjars and warblers. The old quarries are the refuge of bats, amphibians, the shining cranesbill and greater butterfly orchid. Rivers and ponds are home to eel, northern crested newt, European otter, kingfisher, grass snake, common moorhen and plants such as spearwort, yellow flag, arrowhead and &quot;Isopyrum thalictroides&quot;, a small poisonous plant.

==Economy==
The department is largely rural with about 80% being used for agriculture, 8% being urban area and the remainder forest, heath and plantations. Livestock farming predominates, with the breeding of cattle, horses and pigs, and also bee-keeping being important. The soil is generally poor, but it is of better quality around Laval and Château-Gontier. In these parts corn is cultivated and there are plantings of hemp, flax, fruits and vines.
There are many apple orchards and large quantities of cider are made. The department is rich in mineral resources; iron and coal are mined and there are quarries for marble, slate, building stone, limestone and flint; the white sand deposits are used in the manufacture of glass.

Industries include the manufacture of linen, paper and hemp, and cider-making is traditionally carried on in the department. Office furniture is manufactured in Château-Gontier, and Laval is active in the industrial sector, with dairy products, electronics and chemicals in a modern science park.

<text>The Morbihan ( , ; ) is a department in the administrative region of Brittany, situated in the northwest of France. It is named after the Morbihan (&quot;small sea&quot; in Breton), the enclosed sea that is the principal feature of the coastline. It had a population of 759,684 in 2019. It is noted for its Carnac stones, which predate and are more extensive than the Stonehenge monument in Wiltshire, England.

Three major military educational facilities are located in Guer, including École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, the national military academy for officers.

==History==

The Morbihan is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution. It was created from a part of the Duchy of Brittany.

In 1945, cadets from École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, France&#x27;s foremost military academy for officers, were relocated to Camp Coëtquidan (Camp de Coëtquidan) in Guer. This has been developed to include also the École militaire interarmes (inter-services military school), for non-commissioned officers; and École Militaire du Corps Technique et Administratif (military school of the technical and administrative corps).

== Geography ==
The Morbihan, part of the region of Brittany, is surrounded by the departments of Finistère, Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, Ille-et-Vilaine, and Loire-Atlantique, and the Atlantic Ocean on the southwest.

The Gulf of Morbihan has many islands: 365 according to legend. There are actually between 30 and 40, depending on how they are counted. There are also many islets that are too small for any development. Of these islands, all but two are privately owned: l&#x27;Île-aux-Moines and l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Arz. Owners of the others include movie stars, fashion designers, and other wealthy &quot;glitterati&quot;.

In the department of the Morbihan, but outside the Gulf, there are four inhabited islands:
*Belle Île
*Groix
*Houat
*Hoëdic

Meaban, an island just outside the Port du Crouesty, is an ornithological reserve. Visitors are forbidden there.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Lorient; the prefecture Vannes is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
== Art and culture == 
Many residents support maintenance and use of the Breton language, and there are numerous advocates of bilingual education.

The painter Raymond Wintz (1884–1956) depicted locations around the Gulf of Morbihan.

==Politics==
As of 2014, the préfet of the Morbihan is Jean-François Savy, previously head of the Prefectures of Ardennes and of Hautes-Alpes. The president of the Departmental Council is David Lappartient, elected in July 2021.

<doc id="90587" wikidata="Q12657" url="?curid=90587" title="Nièvre">
<text>Nièvre () is a department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, central-east France. Named after the river Nièvre, it had a population of 204,452 in 2019. Its prefecture is Nevers.

Covering an area 6,817 square kilometres (2,632 sq mi), Nièvre is landlocked between six other departments: Yonne to the north, Côte-d&#x27;Or to the east, Saône-et-Loire to the southeast, Allier to the south, Cher to the west and Loiret to the northwest.
==History==
Nièvre is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from the former province of Nivernais.

==Geography==
Nièvre is part of the current region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, although historically it was not part of the province of Burgundy.

The department is crossed by the river Loire, the longest river in France. Industry developed around cast iron foundries using the ample supply of wood then available. Coal mining also developed during the Middle Ages around Decize and continued until the last mine closed in 1974. Forestry is now an important provider of employment. Tourists are attracted by the numerous historic sites. The Canal du Nivernais waterway is popular with houseboating enthusiasts.

==Demographics==
Nièvre is a rural department with about 31 inhabitants per km2. Only one city (Nevers) has more than 10,000 inhabitants. It indicates the characteristic of the department, which is predominantly rural. The department is slowly losing its population since the 1970s, at the rate of 900 people a year. Abandoned houses can be seen in villages and the price of peripheral real estate is one of the lowest in France.

Population development since 1801:

===Principal towns===
The most populous commune is Nevers, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 4,000 inhabitants:

== Wines ==
Nièvre is also well known for its white wine, Pouilly Fumé. The vineyards are scattered around villages including Pouilly-Sur-Loire, which lends its name to the appellation, Tracy sur Loire, Boisgibault, Saint Andelain. The word fumé is French for &quot;smoky&quot;, and it is said the name comes from the smoky or flinty quality of these wines. The only grape allowed in the Pouilly-Fumé AC is Sauvignon blanc, which produces wines that are generally crisp, tart, and somewhat grassy. There is also a confidential production of red pinot noir wine near La Charité sur Loire.

== Politics ==
The President of the Departmental Council is Socialist Fabien Bazin, elected in July 2021. The Departmental Council of Nièvre has 34 seats. The left-wing coalition led by the Socialist Party has 20 seats.

Nièvre is traditionally a left-wing department. The results of the second round of voting in presidential elections reflect this consistently:
* In the 2007 presidential election, Ségolène Royal received 52.91% of the department&#x27;s votes, as against a national per centage of just 46.94%.
* In the 1995 presidential election, Lionel Jospin received 57.07% of the department&#x27;s votes, as against a national per centage of just 47.36%.
* In the 1981 presidential election, François Mitterrand received 62.91% of the department&#x27;s votes, as against a national per centage of 51.76%.

This historical tendency has been recently and dramatically reversed as the far-right Front National party has come out ahead in all the elections since 2015. In the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections, Marine le Pen won most votes in the first rounds. However the two députés of the department belong to République En Marche, the party of Emmanuel Macron.

Nièvre&#x27;s best-known political representative was François Mitterrand who served as a senator and a deputy for the department, as well as mayor of Château-Chinon for 22 years before his election to the presidency of France in 1981.

===Representation in Parliament===
====National Assembly====
In the 2017 legislative election, Nièvre elected the following representatives to the National Assembly:

====Senate====
In the 2017 Senate election, Nièvre elected Patrice Joly (Socialist Party) and Nadia Sollogoub (miscellaneous right) to the Senate.

==Tourism==
==Sport==
The Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours hosted the Formula One French Grand Prix from 1991 to 2008, the Bol d&#x27;Or from 2000 to 2014, and the French round of the Superbike World Championship since 2003. USO Nevers is a professional rugby team that plays in Rugby Pro D2.

<doc id="90591" wikidata="Q747509" url="?curid=90591" title="Los Gatos, California">
<text>Los Gatos (; ; ) is an incorporated town in Santa Clara County, California, United States. The population is 33,529 according to the 2020 census. It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area just southwest of San Jose in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Los Gatos is part of Silicon Valley, with several high technology companies maintaining a presence there. Netflix, the streaming service and content creator, is headquartered in Los Gatos and has developed a large presence in the area.

==Etymology==
&quot;Los Gatos&quot; is Spanish for &quot;The Cats&quot;. The name derives from the 1839 Alta California land grant that encompassed the area, which was called &quot;La Rinconada de Los Gatos&quot; (&quot;The Corner of the Cats&quot;), where the &quot;cats&quot; refers to the cougars (mountain lions) and bobcats that are indigenous to the foothills in which the town is located. The pronunciation is often anglicized to , although one also hears pronunciations truer to the original Spanish, .

==History==
===Overview===
The first inhabitants of the area that is now Los Gatos were the Ohlone Native Americans. At the time the first settlers arrived in the area, it was estimated that approximately 5,000 indigenous people were living in the Valley, and noted that the relationship between the settlers and natives was very good. The first settlers to enter the Valley proper were two soldiers that had strayed from their missionary group on November 2, 1769. By 1777, there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Native Americans living in the mission compound.

The town&#x27;s founding dates to the mid-1850s with the building of a flour-milling operation, Forbes Mill, by James Alexander Forbes along Los Gatos Creek, then called Jones&#x27;s Creek. The mill&#x27;s two-story stone storage annex still stands.

The settlement that was established in the 1860s was originally named for the mill, but the name was changed to Los Gatos after the Spanish land grant. The town was incorporated in 1887 and remained an important town for the logging industry in the Santa Cruz Mountains until the end of the 19th century. Despite being nearby to logging communities, Los Gatos itself only served as a stopping point for those heading into the mountains. With the creation of the Los Gatos Turnpike road, the town was placed in a strategic position on the journey between San Jose and Santa Cruz, and it became an attractive location to live in. Soon, the town was booming. In 1852 only one adobe home existed in the area; by 1868 Los Gatos held the Mill, a blacksmith shop, a stage depot, a lumber yard, a temporary schoolhouse, a hotel, a post office, and several houses. The town began to rapidly gain prominence after the town of Lexington lost its importance with the fall of the timber industry in the area.

In the early 20th century, the town became a thriving agricultural town with apricots, grapes and prunes being grown in the area. By the 1920s, the Los Gatos area had a local reputation as an arts colony, attracting painters, musicians, writers, actors and their bohemian associates as residents over the years. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin lived there as a boy; the actresses Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland (sisters) were graduates of Los Gatos High School; John Steinbeck wrote &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; there (the location is now located in Monte Sereno); Justin Goodsell, a renowned quantum mechanics spectroscopy scientist, was born in this town, and a prominent Beat hero Neal Cassady lived there in the 1950s. Along with much of the Santa Clara Valley, Los Gatos became a suburban community for San Jose beginning in the 1950s, and the town was mostly built out by the 1980s.

=== Architecture ===
Downtown Los Gatos has retained and restored many of its Victorian-era homes and commercial buildings. Notable buildings include the Forbes Mill annex, dating to 1880 and formerly housing a history museum; Los Gatos High School, which dates from the 1920s; and the Old Town Shopping Center, formerly the University Avenue School (the school was established in 1882; the current buildings date to 1923).

The Lyndon Hotel was another location of significance in the town from its establishment in the 1890s until it was razed in 1963.The building was located on the site of a previous hotel. One that had changed hands numerous times over the previous years. But primarily under the ownership of one of the most esteemed Los Gatos business owners at the time. John Weldon Lyndon.

A number of brick buildings in downtown Los Gatos were destroyed or seriously damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, though the district was quickly rebuilt and has made a full recovery.

===Rail transportation===

Rail transport played a large role in Los Gatos&#x27;s historical development, but the city, as of 2020, has no regular passenger train service of any sort. The South Pacific Coast Railroad, a popular narrow-gauge line from Alameda (and San Francisco via ferry) to Santa Cruz in the late 19th century, stopped in Los Gatos. Southern Pacific took over this line in 1887. Los Gatos was also near the Southern Pacific resort town of Holy City, along the rail line in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The last Southern Pacific passenger train to Santa Cruz left Los Gatos on February 26, 1940. In town, the rail line used to run along the shore of Vasona Reservoir to the present-day location of the Post Office, following the path of what is now a continuous string of parking lots between Santa Cruz Ave. and University Ave. There was also a streetcar-type rail line called the Peninsular Railway with service to Saratoga and San Jose that started about 1905 and ended about 1933. San Francisco commuter trains continued into downtown until 1959, and Vasona Junction until 1964. The site of the old railroad station is now occupied by Town Plaza and the post office.

While VTA had originally planned to extend their Green Line to Vasona Junction and bring back passenger rail to the city, the extension was cut short to Winchester due to the high cost of the extension, minimal expected ridership gains, and the difficulty of sharing rail right-of-way to Vasona Junction with Union Pacific freight trains.

===Oil boom===

Between 1891 and 1929, about 20 oil wells were drilled in and around Los Gatos, starting a minor oil-drilling boom. About 1861, small
amounts of oil were discovered in streams, springs, and water
wells in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the vicinity of Moody
Gulch, about south of the Los Gatos Post Office. An intense search for oil ensued,
resulting in the drilling of many wells and establishment of
the Moody Gulch oil field. The
Moody Gulch oil field, however, never met expectations, and
it was abandoned sometime around 1938 after producing a total of about of oil
and of gas. In 1891, one of the Moody Gulch drillers, R.C.
McPherson, found oil in a well along San Jose Road (now Los
Gatos Boulevard) in the Santa Clara Valley flatlands, about northeast of the Los Gatos Post Office. Although commercial production was never established, small amounts of oil
were produced for use as fuel, lubricant, and road tar by local
residents.

==Geography and environment==
Los Gatos is located at (37.236044, −121.961768). Los Gatos is bisected by State Route 17, which runs through the town from south to north.
State Route 85 roughly marks the northern boundary of the town, although a few pockets of homes to its North are included. Highway 9 (Los Gatos-Saratoga Road) from the coast terminates at Highway 17. Downtown Los Gatos, the area on and around Santa Cruz Avenue and Main Street, is located in the southwest quadrant of town. A left exit on northbound Highway 17 becomes the south end of South Santa Cruz Avenue, leading into downtown. The area around Los Gatos Boulevard, east of Highway 17, is much more typically suburban than downtown, with medium-sized shopping centers clustered at major intersections of the multilane boulevard. Although the town has generally a quiet setting, its principal noise generators are State Route 17 and Los Gatos Boulevard. Sound levels within one hundred and fifty feet of Los Gatos Boulevard exceed 60 db CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level), a generally unacceptable range for residential living.
Vasona Park, a county park, and neighboring Oak Meadow Park, which belongs to the town, are located in what is roughly the geographic middle of the town, bordered on the south by Blossom Hill Road, on the east by Highway 17, on the west by University Avenue, and reaching at the north end not quite all the way to Lark Avenue. Located in the parks is the popular William &quot;Billy&quot; Jones Wildcat Railroad. In Vasona Park is the trail to Prune Ridge. Los Gatos Creek begins in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of the town and runs through the town parallel to Highway 17 all the way through neighboring Campbell and San Jose to the Guadalupe River, which flows into San Francisco Bay. A walking, jogging, and biking trail called the Los Gatos Creek Trail runs alongside much of the creek from Lexington Dam through Vasona Park and Campbell to Meridian Avenue in San Jose. In Los Gatos, the trail passes the 1854 Forbes Mill.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . of it is land and of it, comprising 0.71%, is water.

Los Gatos is surrounded by several mountain bike trails. Cyclists can leave from downtown on a loop through the Santa Cruz Mountains. From downtown, El Sereno mountain stands to the southwest; El Sombroso stands to the southeast. The El Sereno Open Space Preserve and the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve open the top and upper flanks of each of these mountains to hiking and cycling.

Though the official total area of the town is 11.2 square miles, approximately of the surrounding Los Gatos Mountains (within the Santa Cruz Mountains range) has a Los Gatos address and uses the 95033 ZIP code (primarily) for U.S. Postal Service mail delivery (among other purposes).

The principal cemetery is the Los Gatos Memorial Park, dating from 1889.

===Climate===
Los Gatos experiences nearly the same temperatures as San Jose, just slightly warmer and with more rain. Los Gatos has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, like much of California. Los Gatos rarely gets a hard frost. Los Gatos gets the slight winter chill that is needed to grow grapes and have vineyards. Types of bananas that ripen within three months grow well during the summer.

The record high temperature was on June 14, 1961, and the record low temperature was on December 22, 1990. There are an average of 27 days annually with highs of or higher and an average of 5 days annually with lows of or lower. Rainfall averages annually and falls on an average of 59 days annually. The wettest year was 1909 with 51.77 inches and the driest year was 2007 with . The most rainfall in one month was 26.56 inches in December 1955 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was 8.48 inches on December 23, 1955. Although snow sometimes falls in the nearby Santa Cruz Mountains, it is very rare in Los Gatos. The most snow on record was 2.0 inches in February 1976. Los Gatos averages 330 sunny days per year.

<text>Baron Samedi (), also written Baron Samdi, Bawon Samedi or Bawon Sanmdi, is one of the lwa of Haitian Vodou. He is a lwa of the dead, along with Baron&#x27;s numerous other incarnations Baron Cimetière, Baron La Croix and Baron Criminel.

He is the head of the Gede family of lwa; his brothers are Azagon Lacroix and Baron Piquant. He is sometimes identified with Guede Nibo.

== Portrayal ==
Baron Samedi is usually depicted with a top hat, black tail coat, dark glasses, and cotton plugs in the nostrils, as if to resemble a corpse dressed and prepared for burial in the Haitian style. He is frequently depicted as a skeleton (but sometimes as a black man that merely has his face painted as a skull), and speaks in a nasal voice. The former dictator of Haiti, François Duvalier, known as Papa Doc, modeled his cult of personality on Baron Samedi; he was often seen speaking in a deep nasal tone and wearing dark glasses.

He is noted for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and having a particular fondness for tobacco and rum. Additionally, he is the loa of resurrection, and in the latter capacity he is often called upon for healing by those near or approaching death, as it is only the Baron that can accept an individual into the realm of the dead.

Due to affiliation with François Duvalier, Baron Samedi is linked to secret societies in the Haitian government and includes them in his domain.

Baron Samedi spends most of his time in the invisible realm of vodou spirits. He is notorious for his outrageous behavior, swearing continuously and making filthy jokes to the other spirits. He is married to another powerful spirit known as Maman Brigitte, but often chases after mortal women. He loves smoking and drinking and is rarely seen without a cigar in his mouth or a glass of rum in his bony fingers. Baron Samedi can usually be found at the crossroads between the worlds of death and the living. When someone dies, he digs their grave and greets their soul after they have been buried, leading them to the underworld.

== Connection to other loa ==
Baron Samedi is the leader of the Gede, loa with particular links to magic, ancestor worship and death. These lesser spirits are dressed like The Baron and are as rude and crude but not nearly as charming as their master. They help carry the dead to the underworld.

== Activities ==
Among believers in Vodou, Baron Samedi is the master of the dead as well as a giver of life. He can cure mortals of any disease or wound so long as he thinks it is worthwhile. His powers are especially great when it comes to Vodou curses and black magic. Even if somebody has been afflicted by a hex that brings them to the verge of death, they will not die if The Baron refuses to dig their grave. So long as The Baron keeps them out of the ground, they are safe.

In many Haitian cemeteries the longest standing grave of male is designated as the grave of Baron Samedi. A cross (the &quot;kwa Bawon&quot;, meaning &quot;Baron&#x27;s cross&quot;) is placed at a crossroads in the cemetery to represent the point where the mortal and spiritual world cross. Often, a black top hat is placed on top of this cross.

He also ensures that all corpses rot in the ground to stop any soul from being brought back as a zombie. What he demands in return depends on his mood. Sometimes he is content with his followers wearing black, white or purple clothes or using sacred objects; he may simply ask for a small gift of cigars, rum, black coffee, grilled peanuts, or bread. But sometimes The Baron requires a Vodou ceremony to help him cross over into this world.

<text>Country rock is a music genre that fuses rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with artists like Waylon Jennings, Buffalo Springfield, Michael Nesmith, Bob Dylan, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, The International Submarine Band and others, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Linda Ronstadt, Little Feat, Poco, Charlie Daniels Band, and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, the Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison&#x27;s solo work, as well as playing a part in the development of Southern rock.

==Definition and etymology==
Rock and roll has usually been seen as a combination of rhythm and blues and country music, a fusion particularly evident in 1950s rockabilly. There has also been cross-pollination throughout the history of both genres; however, the term &quot;country-rock&quot; is used generally to refer to the wave of rock musicians of the late 1960s and early 1970s who began recording rock songs with country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. John Einarson states that, &quot;[f]rom a variety of perspectives and motivations, these musicians either played country with a rock &amp; roll attitude, or added a country feel to rock, or folk, or bluegrass. There was no formula&quot;.

The term &quot;country-rock&quot; had rarely been heard until the critic Richard Goldstein used it the June6, 1968 issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In his piece, titled &quot;Country Rock: Can Y&#x27;All Dig It?&quot;, Goldstein counted several artists as moving towards country-friendly material – including Moby Grape, Stone Poneys, Buffy Sainte-Marie, the International Submarine Band and Bob Dylan – but he expected the Byrds&#x27; forthcoming album, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, to represent the new genre. Before the Byrds&#x27; album was released in August1968, Goldstein considered the Band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;, as the &quot;first major album&quot; of the country-rock movement when he reviewed it for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on August4. Key to the genre, Goldstein wrote, was that the album had country music&#x27;s &quot;twang and... tenacity&quot;, but it also &quot;[made] you want to move&quot; like rock music.

==History==
===Origins===

Country influences can be heard on rock records through the 1960s, including the Beatles&#x27; 1964 recordings &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Instead&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, and their 1965 recording &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Seen A Face&quot;, the Byrds&#x27; 1965 cover version of Porter Wagoner&#x27;s &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot;, or the Rolling Stones &quot;High and Dry&quot; (1966), as well as Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s &quot;Go and Say Goodbye&quot; (1966) and &quot;Kind Woman&quot; (1968). According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, their cover of the Buck Owens country hit &quot;Act Naturally&quot; and their 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; can all be seen &quot;with hindsight&quot; as examples of country rock.

Former TV teen idol and rockabilly recording artist Ricky Nelson pioneered the Country Rock sound as the frontman for his Stone Canyon Band and recorded the 1966 album &quot;Bright Lights &amp; Country Music&quot; and the 1967 album &quot;Country Fever&quot;. Bassist Randy Meisner joined briefly in 1970 after leaving Poco and before joining Eagles.

In 1966, as many rock artists moved increasingly towards expansive and experimental psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival when he went to Nashville to record the album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, playing with notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967) and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians.

Dylan&#x27;s lead was also followed by the Byrds, who were joined by Gram Parsons in 1968. Parsons had mixed country with rock, blues and folk to create what he called &quot;Cosmic American Music&quot;. Earlier in the year Parsons had released &quot;Safe at Home&quot; (although the principal recording for the album had taken place in mid-1967) with the International Submarine Band, which made extensive use of pedal steel and is seen by some as the first true country-rock album. The result of Parsons&#x27; brief tenure in the Byrds was &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; (1968), generally considered one of the finest and most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left before the album was released to join another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. The Byrds hired guitarist Clarence White and drummer Gene Parsons, both from the country band Nashville West. The Flying Burrito Brothers recorded the albums &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; (1969) and &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot; (1970), which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career.

===Expansion===

Country rock was a particularly popular style in the California music scene of the late 1960s, and was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers, Poco (formed by Richie Furay and Jim Messina, formerly of the Buffalo Springfield) and New Riders of the Purple Sage. Some folk-rockers followed the Byrds into the genre, among them the Beau Brummels and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. A number of performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Beatles, who re-explored elements of country in songs such as &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot; from their 1968 self-titled double album (often referred to as the &quot;White Album&quot;), and &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot; from &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969); The Everly Brothers, whose &quot;Roots&quot; album (1968) is usually considered some of their finest work; John Fogerty, who left Creedence Clearwater Revival behind for the country sounds of the Blue Ridge Rangers (1972); Mike Nesmith, who had experimented with country sounds while with the Monkees, formed the First National Band; and Neil Young who moved in and out of the genre throughout his career. One of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band the Dillards. Doug Dillard left the band to form the group Dillard &amp; Clark with ex-Byrds member Gene Clark and Bernie Leadon.

===Peak===
The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with the Doobie Brothers mixing in elements of R&amp;B, Emmylou Harris (the former singer with Parsons) becoming a star on country radio, and Linda Ronstadt, the &quot;queen of country-rock&quot;, creating a highly successful pop-oriented brand of the genre. Pure Prairie League, formed in Ohio in 1970 by Craig Fuller, had both critical and commercial success with five straight Top 40 LP releases, including &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; (1972), acclaimed by AllMusic critic Richard Foss as &quot;an album that is unequaled in country-rock&quot;, and &quot;Two Lane Highway&quot;, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a worthy companion to the likes of the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; and other gems of the genre&quot;. Former Poco and Buffalo Springfield member Jim Messina joined Kenny Loggins in a very successful duo, while former members of Ronstadt&#x27;s backing band went on to form the Eagles (two members of which were from the Flying Burrito Brothers and Poco), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included &quot;Desperado&quot; (1973) and &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976). However, the principal country rock influence in the Eagles came from Bernie Leadon, formerly of the Flying Burrito Brothers, and the Eagles are perceived as shifting towards hard rock after he left the band in late 1975. The Ozark Mountain Daredevils had hit singles &quot;If You Wanna Get To Heaven&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jackie Blue&quot; (1975), the latter of which peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. The Bellamy Brothers had the hit &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot;(1976). In 1979, the Southern rock Charlie Daniels Band moved to a more country direction, released a song with strong bluegrass influence, &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, and the song crossed over and became a hit on the pop chart.

==Legacy==
Outside its handful of stars, country rock&#x27;s greatest significance was on artists in other genres, including the Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Rolling Stones, and George Harrison&#x27;s solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock, which, although largely derived from blues rock, had a distinct southern lilt, and it paved the way for parts of the alternative country movement. The genre declined in popularity in the late-1970s, but some established artists, including Neil Young, have continued to record country-tinged rock into the 21st century. Japan even took influence in the 70s with country rock mainly in the kayokyoku genre. Artists such as Takuro Yoshida, Lily and Saori Minami have often dabbled with country rock in their music. Country rock has survived as a cult force in Texas, where acts including the Flatlanders, Joe Ely, Butch Hancock, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and California-based Richard Brooker have collaborated and recorded. Other performers have produced occasional recordings in the genre, including Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Almost Blue&quot; (1981) and the Robert Plant and Alison Krauss collaboration &quot;Raising Sand&quot;, which was one of the most commercially successful albums of 2007. Kid Rock, who broke through into mainstream success with a rap rock sound, gradually developed a country rock sound. In 2013, British country rock band Rocky and the Natives released &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It for the Old Guys&quot; with two American members, drummer Andy Newmark and acoustic guitarist Bob Rafkin. Rafkin had written &quot;Lazy Waters&quot; for The Byrds from the 1971 album Farther Along, and Andy Newmark had played on the 1973 Gene Parsons album Kindling. Canadian country rock band Blue Rodeo has found considerable success in Canada, selling multi-platinum albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and continues to receive frequent radio airplay on Canadian radio stations. Later in 2013 Rocky and the Natives&#x27; country rock cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Tight A$&quot; was included on the &quot;Lennon Bermuda&quot; album.

A revival of country music blended with rock features in the 2020s was titled &quot;ronky tonk&quot; in the music press, with acts such as Zach Bryan, Jackson Dean, and Bailey Zimmerman identified by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Jelly Roll is another crossover artist that blends a unique fashion of country and rock, sometimes with hip hop influences.

==Country metal==

Country metal is the fusion country music elements with heavy metal and sometimes other elements elements such as nu metal and hard rock. Brantley Gilbert and Hardy have been described as country metal, with Hardy incorporating nu metal elements into his sound. The roots of country metal can be traced back to &quot;Rebel Meets Rebel&quot;, a 2006 album by David Allan Coe featuring Dimebag Darrell, Vinnie Paul, and Rex Brown, all from Pantera. Allmusic described the album as a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; mix of country and heavy metal, and noted that fiddle is included, being played by Joey Floyd. &quot;Billboard&quot; also noted that Jason Aldean&#x27;s thunderous 2008 single &quot;She&#x27;s Country&quot; received comparisons to AC/DC.

Countrycore is a genre term created by the media to describe the style of Brazilian band Matanza, who fuse country music with heavy metal and hardcore punk.

==Other manifestations==

<text>Baron La Croix () is one of the Gede, a lwa of the dead and sexuality, along with Baron Samedi and Baron Cimetière in Vodou. He is syncretized with Saint Expeditus. Baron La Croix is also known as Azagon Lacroix.

==Worship== 

Baron La Croix is often seen wearing a black tailcoat and carrying an elaborate cane, and is considered suave and sophisticated, cultured and debonair. He has an existential philosophy about death, finding death&#x27;s reason for being both humorous and absurd. Baron La Croix is the extreme expression of individuality and offers the reminder of delighting in life&#x27;s pleasures. Baron La Croix (also called Bawon Lakwa) accepts the colors purple and black. He enjoys two servings of coffee, one sweetened with only sugar, and one bitter. He also accepts rum infused with 21 scotch bonnet peppers, or any hot pepper, as long as it equates to 21 when presenting the offering; when presenting the rum and hot peppers, the bottle is usually left open. He also eats hot peppers by themselves as an offering. Bawon Lakwa takes incense and cigarettes as offerings as well. While making a petition to him, he enjoys his cigarettes lit and on the altar. Baron Lakwa&#x27;s associated day of the week is Monday.

The largest town by a considerable margin is the prefecture, Alençon, which is an administrative and commercial centre for what is still an overwhelmingly rural department. There are no large industrial centres, and agriculture remains the economic focus.

== Demographics ==

The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Ornais&quot;.

The recorded population level peaked at 443,688 in 1836. Declining farm incomes and the lure of better prospects in the overseas empire led to a sustained reduction in population levels in many rural departments. By the time of the 1936 census, the recorded population stood at just 269,331. Once motor car ownership started to surge in the 1960s, employment opportunities became less restricted and by 1982, the population level had recovered a little to 295,000, after which it slowly decreased.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Alençon, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

<text>Bas-Rhin () is a département in Alsace which is a part of the Grand Est super-region of France. The name means &#x27;Lower Rhine&#x27;, referring to its lower altitude among the two French Rhine departments: it is downstream of the Haut-Rhin (Upper Rhine) department. Both belong to the European Upper Rhine region. It is, with the Haut-Rhin (Upper Rhine), one of the two departments of the traditional Alsace region which until 1871, also included the area now known as the Territoire de Belfort. The more populous and densely populated of the pair, it had 1,152,662 inhabitants in 2021. The prefecture is based in Strasbourg. The INSEE and Post Code is 67.

On 1 January 2021, the departemental councils of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin merged into the European Collectivity of Alsace.

The inhabitants of the department are known as or .

== Geography ==
The Rhine has always been of great historical and economic importance to the area, and it forms the eastern border of Bas-Rhin. The area is also home to some of the foothills of the Vosges Mountains.

To the north of Bas-Rhin lies the Palatinate forest &quot;(Pfälzerwald)&quot; in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate, and the German State of Baden-Württemberg lies to the east. To the south lies the department of Haut-Rhin, the town of Colmar and southern Alsace, and to the west the department of Moselle. On its south-western corner, Bas-Rhin also joins the departments of Vosges and Meurthe-et-Moselle.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Strasbourg, the prefecture. As of 2021, there are 7 communes with more than 15,000 inhabitants:

=== Climate ===

The Bas-Rhin has a continental-type climate, characterised by cold, dry winters and hot, stormy summers, due to the western protection provided by the Vosges. The average annual temperature is in the lowlands (Entzheim) and on high ground. The annual maximum temperature is high (). The average rainfall is per year.

Established according to data from the Infoclimat station at Strasbourg-Entzheim (the airport), over the period from 1961 to 1990.



==Etymology==
Bas-Rhin is the last French department to have kept the term &quot;Bas&quot; meaning &quot;Lower&quot; in its name. Other departments using this prefix preferred to change their names - e.g.: &quot;Basses-Pyrénées&quot; in 1969 became Pyrénées-Atlantiques and &quot;Basses-Alpes&quot; in 1970 became the department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. The same phenomenon was observed for the &quot;inférieur&quot; (also meaning &quot;lower&quot;) departments such as &quot;Charente-Inférieure&quot;, &quot;Seine-Inférieure&quot;, and &quot;Loire-Inférieure&quot;.

== History ==
Bas-Rhin is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790, during the French Revolution.

On 14 January 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decreed:

*&quot;- That Alsace be divided into two departments with Strasbourg and Colmar as their capitals;
*- That the Department of Strasbourg will be divided into three districts [...];
*- That the land of the German princes, coming under the sovereignty of France will be included in the division of districts;
*- That Landau, an enclave in the Palatinate, will have special justice [...].&quot;

The borders of Bas-Rhin have changed many times:

*In 1793 it absorbed the following territories newly annexed by France:
**The County of Sarrewerden;
**The County of Drulingen;
**The lordship of Diemeringen;
*The lordship of Asswiller of the Steinkallenfels family;
*Several communes from the Palatinate
*In 1795 the region of Schirmeck - where the people did not speak Alsatian - was detached from the district of Sélestat and attached to Vosges (District of Senones);
*In 1808 some territories east of the Rhine were annexed, especially the city of Kehl;
*In 1814, after the first Treaty of Paris, France gained the territories north of the Lauter from the former department of Mont-Tonnerre and including the city of Landau, but lost all the territories east of the Rhine;
*In 1815, following the second Treaty of Paris, France lost all the territories north of the Lauter and the department was occupied by troops from Baden and Saxony from June 1815 to November 1818.
*In 1871 Bas-Rhin was annexed by Germany (by the Treaty of Frankfurt) and then became &quot;Bezirk Unterelsass&quot; in Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen;
*In 1919 Bas-Rhin became French again (Treaty of Versailles) and retained the territories that Germany had taken from the department of Vosges in 1871 (the Canton of Schirmeck and Canton of Saales);
*Between 1941 and 1944, the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp was in operation
*In 1944 Kehl was attached to Bas-Rhin before being reassigned to the new West Germany in 1953;
*In 1982 the department is included in the newly created Alsace region;
*On 7 April 2013 a referendum was held on the creation of a single community in Alsace for joining the Alsace region and the two departments of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin.

Strasbourg, the &quot;chef lieu&quot; (principal city) of Bas-Rhin is the official seat of the European Parliament as well as of the Council of Europe.

===Heraldry===
==Demography==
The demography of Bas-Rhin is characterized by high density and high population growth since the 1950s.

In January 2014 Bas-Rhin officially had 1,112,815 inhabitants and was 18th by population at the national level. In fifteen years, from 1999 to 2014, its population grew by more than 86,000 people, or about 5,800 people per year. But this variation is differentiated among the 517 communes that make up the department.

The population density of Bas-Rhin is 234 inhabitants per square kilometre in 2014 which is more than twice the average in France, which was 112 in 2009.

===Changing demographics in Bas-Rhin===
The first census was conducted in 1801 and this count, renewed every five years from 1821, provides precise information on the evolution of population in the department.

With 540,213 inhabitants in 1831, the department represented 1.66% of the total French population, which was then 32,569,000 inhabitants. From 1831 to 1866, the department gained 48,757 people, an increase of 0.26% on average per year compared to the national average of 0.48% over the same period.

Demographic change between the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First World War was higher than the national average. Over this period, the population increased by 100,532 inhabitants, an increase of 16.74%, compared to 10% nationally. The population increased by 9.23% between the two world wars from 1921 to 1936 compared to a national growth of 6.9%.

Like other French departments, Bas-Rhin experienced a population boom after the Second World War, higher than the national level. The rate of population growth between 1946 and 2007 was 83.83%, compared to 57% nationally.

==Economy==
The Bas-Rhin department has a high density of SMEs and SMIs and a higher proportion of workers in industry than the national average. Tourism activity is intense and creates many indirect jobs. The rate of unemployment is among the lowest in France: 6.5%. The average GDP per capita is €18,795 which places the region as the second largest in France with 2.9% of national GDP. Employment is distributed in the following way, as a percentage of the labor force:
Agriculture: 8,411 or 2%
Crafts and industry: 97,349 or 24.2%
Building and Public Works: 23,928 or 6.0%
Tertiary Sector: 271,984 or 67.8%
&quot;Frontaliers&quot;: 28,186

;Weighting of the major economic sectors

Trades: 11 358 companies comprising:
*Supply: 11%
*Production: 21%
*Building: 37%
*Services: 31%

Food industry : 568 units employing 15,884 employees

Commerce:
*Hypermarkets : 15
*Supermarkets : 117
*Other retail: 7,507 including non-food 5,229

Tourism: 3,216 hotels with 11,100 rooms

== Law ==
Alsace and the adjacent Moselle department have a legal system slightly different from the rest of France. The statutes in question date from the period 1871–1919 when the area was part of the German Empire. With the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France in 1919, Paris accepted that Alsace and Moselle should retain some local laws in respect of certain matters, especially with regard to hunting, economic life, local government relationships, health insurance and social rights. It includes notably the absence of any formal separation between church and state: several mainstream denominations of the Christian church benefit from state funding, in contrast to principles applied in the rest of France.

<text>Haut-Rhin () is a département in the Grand Est region, France, bordering both Germany and Switzerland. It is named after the river Rhine. Its name means &quot;Upper Rhine&quot;. Haut-Rhin is the smaller and less populated of the two departments of the former administrative Alsace region, the other being the Bas-Rhin (Lower Rhine). Especially after the 1871 cession of the southern territory known since 1922 as Territoire de Belfort, although it is still rather densely populated compared to the rest of metropolitan France. It had a population of 767,083 in 2021.

On 1 January 2021, the départemental collectivities of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin were merged into the European Collectivity of Alsace.

== History ==
Haut-Rhin is one of the original 83 départements, created during the French Revolution, on 4 March 1790 through the application of the law of 22 December 1789 in respect of the southern half of the province of Alsace (Haute-Alsace).

Its boundaries have been modified many times:
* 1798, it absorbed Mulhouse, formerly a free city, and the last Swiss enclave in the south of Alsace;
* 1800, it absorbed the whole &quot;département&quot; of Mont-Terrible;
* 1814, it lost the territories which had been part of Mont-Terrible, which were returned to Switzerland, except for the former County of Montbéliard;
* 1816, it lost Montbéliard, which was transferred to the &quot;département&quot; of Doubs;
* 1871, it was mostly annexed by the German Empire (Treaty of Frankfurt); the remaining French part formed the Territoire de Belfort in 1922;
* 1919, it was reverted to France (Treaty of Versailles) but remains administratively separated from Belfort.
* 1940, it was annexed de facto by Nazi Germany.
* 1944, it was recovered by France.

== Geography ==
Haut-Rhin is bordered by the Territoire de Belfort and Vosges &quot;départements&quot; and the Vosges Mountains to the west, the Bas-Rhin &quot;département&quot; to the North, Switzerland to the south and its eastern border with Germany is also the Rhine. In the centre of the &quot;département&quot; lies a fertile plain. The climate is semi-continental.

===Subdivisions===
The department consists of the following &quot;arrondissements&quot;:
*Altkirch
*Colmar-Ribeauvillé
*Mulhouse
*Thann-Guebwiller

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Mulhouse; the prefecture Colmar is the second-most populous. As of 2021, there are 11 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development between 1801 and 2016:
== Economy ==
Haut-Rhin is one of the richest French &quot;départements&quot;. Mulhouse is the home of the Stellantis Mulhouse Plant automobile factory, where the Peugeot 2008 and Peugeot 508 are currently built. The lowest unemployment rate in France can be found in the Southern Sundgau region (approximately 2%). The countryside is marked by hills. Many &quot;Haut-Rhinois&quot; work in Switzerland, especially in the chemical industries of Basel, but commute from France where living costs are lower. However, the region does have some of France&#x27;s worst socio-economic inequalities; Mulhouse has long been one of France&#x27;s poorest major cities.

== Law ==

Alsace and the adjacent Moselle department have a legal system slightly different from the rest of France. The statutes in question date from the period 1871–1919 when the area was part of the German Empire. With the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Paris accepted that Alsace and Moselle should retain some local laws in respect of certain matters, especially with regard to hunting, economic life, local government relationships, health insurance and social rights. It includes notably the absence of any formal separation between church and state: several mainstream denominations of the Christian church benefit from state funding, in contrast to principles applied in the rest of France.

<text>Haute-Saône (; Frainc-Comtou: &quot;Hâte-Saône&quot;; English: Upper Saône) is a department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of northeastern France. Named after the river Saône, it had a population of 235,313 in 2019. Its prefecture is Vesoul; its sole subprefecture is Lure.

== History ==
The department was created in the early years of the French Revolution through the application of a law dated 22 December 1789, from part of the former province of Franche-Comté. The frontiers of the new department corresponded approximately to those of the old Bailiwick of Amont.

The department was also marked by the Franco-Prussian War with the battles of Héricourt, and Villersexel but also the proximity of the Siege of Belfort. The department welcomes Alsatians fleeing the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine.

The department has an important mining and industrial past (coal, salt, iron, lead-silver-copper mines, bituminous shale, stationery, spinning, weaving, forges, foundries, tileries, mechanical factories).

== Geography ==
Haute-Saône is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, and is divided into 2 arrondissements and 17 cantons. Neighbouring departments are Côte-d&#x27;Or to the west, Haute-Marne to the north-west, Vosges to the north, Territoire de Belfort to the east, Doubs to the south and east and Jura to south. The commune of Champlitte is the largest commune in this department, with an area of .

The department can be presented as a transitional territory positioned between several of the more depressed departments of eastern France and the so-called Blue Banana zone characterised, in recent decades by relatively powerful economic growth.

== Economy ==
The department is overwhelmingly rural, despite the area having been at the forefront of industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The industrial tradition remains, but industrial businesses tend to be on a small scale. In 2006 employment by economic sector was reported as follows:

: * Agriculture 4,919 employees
: * Construction 4,504 employees
: * Industrial sector 18,747 employees
: * Service sector 44,865 employees

== Demographics ==

In common with many rural departments in France, Haute-Saône has experienced a savage reduction in population, from nearly 350,000 in the middle of the nineteenth century to barely 200,000 on the eve of the Second World War, as people migrated to newly industrialising population centres, often outside Metropolitan France.

During the second half of the twentieth century the mass mobility conferred by the surge in automobile ownership permitted some recovery of the population figure to approximately 234,000 in 2004.

===Principal towns===

The rural nature of the department is highlighted by the absence of large towns and cities. Even the department&#x27;s capital, Vesoul, still has a population below 20,000. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Yves Krattinger, first elected in 2001.

<text>Saône-et-Loire (; Arpitan: &quot;Sona-et-Lêre&quot;) is a department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in France. It is named after the rivers Saône and Loire, between which it lies, in the country&#x27;s central-eastern part.

Saône-et-Loire is Bourgogne-Franche-Comté&#x27;s most populous department with a population of 551,493 as of 2019. It is also its southernmost department, as it is situated on the regional border with Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Saône-et-Loire&#x27;s prefecture is Mâcon, with subprefectures in Autun, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles and Louhans. Its INSEE and postcode number is 71.

==History==
When it was formed during the French Revolution, as of March 4, 1790 in fulfillment of the law of December 22, 1789, the new department combined parts of the provinces of southern Burgundy and Bresse, uniting lands that had no previous common history nor political unity and which have no true geographical unity. Thus its history is that of Burgundy, and is especially to be found in the local histories of Autun, Mâcon, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles and Louhans.

==Geography==
Saône-et-Loire is the seventh largest department of France. It is part of the region Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. In the west, the department is composed of the hills of the &quot;Autunois&quot;, the region around Autun, in the southwest the Charollais, and the Mâconnais in the south.

In the centre, the department is traversed from north to south by the Saône in its wide plain; the Saône is a tributary of the River Rhône that joins it at Lyon and thus is connected to the Mediterranean Sea. The source of the Loire, is south of the department, in the department of Ardèche. It then makes its way in the opposite direction, forming the southwest border of the department, and eventually draining into the Atlantic Ocean. The Canal du Centre links the Saône to the Loire between Chalon-sur-Saône and Digoin, thereby linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. In the east, the department occupies the northern part of the plain of Bresse. In the west, its industrial heart is in Le Creusot and Montceau-les-Mines, formerly noted for their coal mines and metallurgy.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Chalon-sur-Saône; the prefecture Mâcon is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

===Subdivisions===
The department consists of five arrondissements:
*Autun
*Chalon-sur-Saône

<text>The Gede () are the family of lwa, spirits or deities associated with Ancestor worship in Haitian Vodou, that represent the powers of death and fertility. They are often said to be found at burial sites, where they escort the deceased to their afterlife. Gede spirits include Gede Doub, Guede-Linto, Guede L&#x27;Orage, Guede Oussou, Guede Nibo and Guede Masaka, and Guede Ti Malice. All are known for the drum rhythm and dance called the &quot;banda&quot;. In possession, they will drink or rub themselves with a mixture of clairin (raw rum) and twenty-one scotch bonnet or goat peppers. Fèt Gede is celebrated on 2 November, All Souls&#x27; Day (&quot;Festival of the Dead&quot;). Boons granted by the Gede not repaid by this date will be avenged afterwards.

* Papa Gede is the corpse of the first man who ever died. He is recognized as a short, dark man with a high hat on his head who likes to smoke cigars and eat apples. Papa Gede is a psychopomp who waits at the crossroads to take souls into the afterlife. He is considered the good counterpart to Baron Samedi. If a child is dying, Papa Gede is prayed to. It is believed that he will not take a life before its time, and that he will protect the little ones. Papa Gede has a very crass sense of humor, a divine ability to read others&#x27; minds, and the ability to know everything that happens in the worlds of the living and the dead.

* Brav Gede is the guardian and watchman of the graveyard. He keeps the dead souls in and the living souls out. He is sometimes considered an aspect of Nibo.

* Gede Bábáco is Papa Guede&#x27;s lesser-known brother and is also a psychopomp. His role is somewhat similar to that of Papa Guede, but he doesn&#x27;t have the special abilities of his brother.

* Guede Nibo is a psychopomp, an intermediary between the living and the dead. He was the first person to die by violence, so he is the patron of those who died by unnatural causes (disaster, accident, misadventure, or violence). He is the guardian of the graves of those who died prematurely, particularly those whose final resting place is unknown. His &quot;chevals&quot; (&quot;horses&quot;, possessed devotees) can give voice to the dead spirits whose bodies have not been found or that have not been reclaimed from &quot;below the waters&quot;.

* Baron Criminel (&quot;Baron of Criminals&quot;) is the enforcer of the Gede. He was the first person to kill another (probably Nibo). As the first murderer, he is master of those who murder or use violence to harm others. Families of murder victims and the abused pray to him to get revenge on those who wronged them. His &quot;horses&quot; have an insatiable appetite and will attack people until they are offered food. If it doesn&#x27;t please them or takes too long, they will bite and chew on anyone nearby (or even themselves) until they are sated. He is syncretized with St. Martin de Porres, perhaps because his feast day is November 3, the day after Fèt Gede. He is sacrificed black roosters that have been bound, doused with strong spirit, and then set alight.

* Maman Brigitte (&quot;Mother Bridget&quot;) is the wife of Baron Samedi. She is syncretized with St. Brigid, perhaps because she is the protector of crosses and gravestones.

==Marassa: The divine twins==

The Guede lwa have their own versions of the Twins, which appear as gravediggers. Twins are seen as having divine insight and vision. They are also part of the material world and the spiritual world (in their case, the living and the dead). They usually wear contrasting colors.

Guede Masaka assists Guede Nibo. He is an androgynous male gravedigger and spirit of the dead, recognized by his black shirt, white jacket, and white headscarf.

Guede Oussou wears a black or mauve jacket marked on the back with a white cross and a black or mauve headscarf. His name means &quot;tipsy&quot; due to his love of white rum. Guede Oussou is sometimes also linked with the female Guede L&#x27;Oraille.

== Bawon Gede==
The Gede are closely associated with the lwa, Bawon, whose aspects are Bawon Samdi (Baron Saturday) - ruler of the graveyard, Baron La Croix (Baron of the Cross) - guardian of the gravestone, and Baron Cimetière (Baron of the Cemetery) - guardian of the grave. 
Depending on the tradition followed, Bawon is:
# one of the Gede
# their spiritual protector, who has raised them from the dead with the help of Bawon Samdi&#x27;s wife, Maman Brigitte.
# An aspect of the Gede gods.

In any of these configurations, Bawon, Maman Brigitte, and the Gede rule death, the cemetery, and the grave.

<text>Sarthe () is a department of the French region of Pays de la Loire, and the province of Maine, situated in the &quot;Grand-Ouest&quot; of the country. It is named after the river Sarthe, which flows from east of Le Mans to just north of Angers. It had a population of 566,412 in 2019.

== History ==
In the late 18th century, before it was officially Sarthe, the nobility built their mansions and chateaux in this region, as an escape from Paris.

The department was created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, pursuant to the law of 22 December 1789, starting from a part of the province of Maine. The latter was divided into two departments, Sarthe to the east and Mayenne to the west.

In Roman times, this province contained the city of Mans, and many of its ruins are still standing. The Roman Thermal Bathhouse attracts many tourists, as does the Theater of Aubigné-Racan, both located on the outskirts of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine.

Marin Mersenne, perhaps the most important scientific figure in the early 17th century, was born in the vicinity of Sarthe.

== Geography ==
The department of Sarthe is at the north end of the administrative region of Pays de la Loire. It is south of Normandy and on the southern edge of the Armorican Massif. It is bordered by the departments of Orne, Eure-et-Loir, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire, Maine-et-Loire and Mayenne.

The arrival of the railways in 1854 boosted trade for the local economy. A TGV connection was constructed in 1989, connecting the community to high-speed transport. In terms of road connections, the A11 autoroute, which was constructed to Le Mans from the east in 1978, enhances Sarthe&#x27;s strategic position as the gateway to the French west.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Le Mans, the prefecture. Approximately 370,000 people, comprising 65% of the department&#x27;s population, live in the Le Mans urban area. The rest of the department retains a rural character, with agriculture as the chief part of the economy. As of 2019, there are 4 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Politics==

The department was the electoral base of former Prime Minister François Fillon, who since 2012 sits in the National Assembly of France for a constituency in central Paris. The president of the Departmental Council is Dominique Le Mèner, elected in 2015.

<text>Haute-Savoie () is a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of Southeastern France, bordering both Switzerland and Italy. Its prefecture is Annecy. To the north is Lake Geneva; to the south and southeast are Mont Blanc and the Aravis mountain range.

It holds its name from the Savoy historical region, as does the department of Savoie, located south of Haute-Savoie. In 2019, it had a population of 826,094. Its subprefectures are Bonneville, Saint-Julien-en-Genevois and Thonon-les-Bains. The French entrance to the Mont Blanc Tunnel into Italy is in Haute-Savoie. It is noted for winter sports; the first Winter Olympic Games were held at Chamonix in 1924.

== History ==

The historical region of Savoy was governed by the House of Savoy, the ruling dynasty of Savoy from 1032 to 1860. The Dukes of Savoy were rulers of the Savoy region from 1416 to 1720.

The territory occupied by modern Haute-Savoie and the adjoining department of Savoie became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Annexation of the region by France was formalised in the Treaty of Turin on March 24, 1860.
From November 1942 to September 1943, Haute-Savoie was subjected to military occupation by Fascist Italy. The Maquis des Glières (a band of Free French Resistance fighters who opposed the Nazi, Vichy and Milice regimes during World War II) operated from Haute-Savoie. In the winter of 1943–1944, German troops burned down around 500 farms in response to French Resistance activities.

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Haute-Savoie===
The Departmental Council of Haute-Savoie has 34 seats. As of 2020, fifteen councillors are part of the Haute-Savoie Union group (miscellaneous right), fourteen are part of the Avenir Haute-Savoie group (The Republicans) and five are part of the Union du Centre group (The Centrists). Martial Saddier had been President of the Departmental Council since 2021.

===Representation in Paris===
====National Assembly====
Haute-Savoie elected the following members of the National Assembly in the 2022 legislative election:

====Senate====

Haute-Savoie sends three Senators to Parliament. Loïc Hervé and Cyril Pellevat were both elected in 2014; Sylviane Noël took office in 2018.

== Geography ==

Haute-Savoie comprises four arrondissements, divided into 279 communes and 17 cantons. To the north, it borders the Swiss canton of Geneva and Lake Geneva; to the east the Swiss canton of Valais and Italy&#x27;s Aosta Valley; to the west the French department of Ain; and to the south the department of Savoie.

Haute-Savoie has the largest range of elevations of all the departments in France; the lowest point is in the Rhône Valley, and the highest Mont Blanc at . Some of the world&#x27;s best-known ski resorts are in Haute-Savoie.

The terrain of the department includes the Alpine Mont Blanc range; the French Prealps of the Aravis Range, the Chablais, Bornes and Bauges Alps; and the peneplains of Genevois haut-savoyard and Albanais (known collectively as &quot;L&#x27;Avant-pays savoyard&quot;). Its mountainous terrain makes mountain passes important to trade and economic life. Some of the most important are the Col de la Forclaz (which connects Chamonix to the canton of Valais) and the Mont Blanc Tunnel, linking Chamonix to Courmayeur in the Aosta Valley.

===Forests===
As of 1996, of Haute-Savoie is forested (38.8 percent of the total land area), compared to 34.4 percent for the Rhone-Alpes region and 27.1 percent for France as a whole. Of the forested area (79 percent) is managed for timber and other forest products, with the remaining having no commercial value or used for outdoor recreation.
National nature reserves are designated by the French government as areas where an outstanding natural heritage is present in both rare and typical areas in terms of species and geology. Management is charged to local organizations, with direction and evaluation focusing on long-term protection for future generations and environmental education. Of the of land not managed for timber, Haute-Savoie has nine national nature reserves totaling .
* Aiguilles Rouges National Nature Reserve – 
* Bout du Lac d&#x27;Annecy National Nature Reserve – 
* Carlaveyron National Nature Reserve – 
* Contamines-Montjoie National Nature Reserve –

Screw-cutting is a precision parts-machining industry, and Haute-Savoie generates the bulk of French screws. Firms engaged in screw-cutting are major employers in the department. While the automotive industry is the principal client, firms also service the electronics, household-appliance and medical sectors.

Arve Industries is part of 67 &quot;competitiveness clusters&quot; created in 2005.
The cluster is dedicated to mechatronics and includes 60,000 industrial jobs in over 280 companies (primarily small), 1,200 researchers and 250 patents in 2002.
Among the projects supported by the cluster is inertial tolerancing, a new approach in evaluating the quality of machined parts. Based on the Taguchi loss function, inertia is defined by its deviation from its target. Inertial tolerancing is a research-and-development program supported by the cluster for its member companies. It is led by a research team from the Symme Laboratory of the University of Savoie and the CTDEC (&quot;Centre Technique du Decolletage&quot;). The publication of the French standard NFX 04-008 demonstrates the relevance of topics covered by the cluster.

Other programs involve the production of clean parts (4P project), developing new models of customer-supplier relationships to improve the effectiveness of simultaneous engineering tasks, and development of the international visibility of the cluster and its members.
The companies concerned are involved with industrial mechanics, precision engineering, precision turning and sub-assemblies and mechanical assemblies, often associated with integrating technologies such as plastics, electronics and hydraulics.
Markets served by member companies of the cluster include transport (cars, trucks, rail and air), production and distribution of electricity, hydraulics (gas or liquid, high-pressure vacuum), medical and health-related.

=== Services ===
In late December 2000, the service sector employed 75,768 people in 11,129 companies in:
* Hotels and restaurants – 26.5 percent
* Real estate activities – 24.6 percent
* Consulting and assistance – 14.0 percent
* Transportation – 6.1 percent
* Financial activities – 6.2 percent

=== Tourism ===
As of late December 2000, the tourism sector had a total of 635,000 beds divided as follows:
* 1,250 – Rural lodgings
* 803 – Hotels
* 453 – Guest rooms
* 191 – Campsites
* 70 – Bed-and-breakfasts
* 40 – Mountain huts

In 1999 there were 37.9 million overnight stays: 56 percent in winter and 44 percent during the rest of the year.
===Cross-border workers===
Many people who live in Haute-Savoie (more than 52,200 in November 2006) work in Switzerland (in the cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais). The phenomenon has accelerated since bilateral agreements concluded between Switzerland and the European Union, of which a significant part concerned free movement of people. In 2007, commuting increased over 12%.

Effective June 1, 2007, residents of Haute-Savoie may freely work in Switzerland. The department and municipalities receive compensation (&quot;frontier funds&quot;) allocated to municipalities in proportion to the number of border residents there. Following an agreement signed in Geneva in 1973, the Canton of Geneva transferred to Haute-Savoie 3.5 percent of total worker compensation, equivalent in December 2006 to €77.687 million.

===Export===
Exports are an important part of the economy; forty percent of Haute-Savoie employees work for exporting firms. Exports are primarily to Germany, the United States, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Imports come mainly from Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United States.

=== Taxation ===
Haute-Savoie has property and income taxes. In 2006, 312,823 households were subject to property taxes and 27,747 were exempt.
The average income tax per household was €25,621 in 2007 (compared with the national average of €21,930).

=== Transport ===
Haute Savoie is served by the A41 and A43 highways. Annecy is accessible from Lyon, with an estimated travel time between two and three hours in normal traffic. Since it is closer to Geneva, the new highway connects the two cities in about an hour.
Meythet Airport in Annecy has Air France Regional round-trip service to Paris Orly.
Saint-Gervais is the only railroad station directly serving a ski resort. The main rail line serves Annecy-Annemasse-Geneva. The Annecy railway station has TGV (high speed trains) departures and arrivals to and from Paris via the high-speed line from Lyon Part-Dieu. Intercity Public transport is run by Lihsa.

<text>Seine-et-Marne () is a department in the Île-de-France region in Northern France. Named after the rivers Seine and Marne, it is the region&#x27;s largest department with an area of 5,915 square kilometres (2,284 square miles); it roughly covers its eastern half. In 2019, it had a population of 1,421,197. Its prefecture is Melun, although both Meaux and Chelles have larger populations.

==History==
Seine-et-Marne is one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution in application of the law of 22 December 1789. It had previously belonged to the former province of Île-de-France. It is the only original departement in the Île-de-France that has remained unchanged, as both Seine and Seine-et-Oise were abolished and reorganised in 1968.

==Geography==
===Situation===

Seine-et-Marne forms a part of the Île-de-France region; the department covers 49% of the region&#x27;s land area. It is bordered by Val-d&#x27;Oise, Seine-Saint-Denis, Val-de-Marne, Essonne to the west; Loiret and Yonne to the south; Aube and Marne to the east; and Aisne and Oise to the north. It is served by RER A, RER B, RER D and RER E amongst other services.

Melun is Seine-et-Marne&#x27;s prefecture. Fontainebleau, Meaux, Provins and Torcy are its subprefectures. The department comprises part of Paris&#x27;s outer eastern suburbs; much of Charles de Gaulle Airport sits within its far northwestern boundaries, including a majority of the terminals. The department has many natural reserves, notably Brie and Gâtinais. The department&#x27;s highest point is butte Saint-George (215 m).

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Meaux; the prefecture Melun is the third-most populous. As of 2019, there are 17 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants. The 10 most populous communes are:

===Climate===
Seine-et-Marne has a temperate Atlantic climate. The average rainfall is based upon that of Fontainebleau, giving an average rainfall of , which is higher than the average of Île-de-France: . Average temperature in Melun during the 1953–2002 period was for January and for July.

The storm of 26 December 1999 led to five deaths in Seine-et-Marne and caused several trees to fall.

== Demographics ==

People from Seine-et-Marne are known as the &quot;Seine-et-Marnais&quot;.

Originally Seine-et-Marne was very rural and lightly populated. Over the past 50 years, however, its population has tripled, due to the development of the Paris conurbation and the building of new towns in the northwest of the region. The population was estimated to be 1,267,496 inhabitants in 2006. The region has changed from consisting only of small villages to forming a large part of the Paris conurbation.

Seine-et-Marne as a whole shares a sister city relationship with Orlando, Florida, United States, as both host Disney theme parks.

==Economy==

With 60 percent of the region used as farmland, Seine-et-Marne is where most agricultural activity occurs within Île-de-France. Cereals and sugar beet are the principal exports from Seine-et-Marne.

The other key industrial structures are the refinery at Grandpuits and the Safran Aircraft Engines research plant at Villaroche. The new town of Marne-la-Vallée is the centre of tourism in Seine-et-Marne in terms of number of visitors, mainly due to the Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park theme parks at Disneyland Paris.

==Politics==

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Departmental Council of Seine-et-Marne===
The Departmental Council of Seine-et-Marne has 46 seats. Councillors are elected for six-year terms (no term limits) across the department&#x27;s 23 cantons (two per canton). Since 2021, Jean-François Parigi of The Republicans (LR) has served as President of the Departmental Council.

===National representation===

<text>Deux-Sèvres (, Poitevin-Saintongese: &quot;Deùs Saevres&quot;) is a French department. &quot;Deux-Sèvres&quot; literally means &quot;two Sèvres&quot;: the Sèvre Nantaise and the Sèvre Niortaise are two rivers which have their sources in the department. It had a population of 374,878 in 2019.

==In history and literature==
&quot;Deux-Sèvres&quot; was one of the 83 original &quot;départements&quot; created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. The land had been part of the ancient province of Poitou.

Departmental borders were changed in 1973 when the inhabitants of the little commune of Puy-Saint-Bonnet became formally associated with the rapidly growing adjacent commune of Cholet, which is in the neighbouring department of Maine-et-Loire. To prevent the associated communes from being administered in separate departments, Puy-Saint-Bonnet was transferred into Maine-et-Loire.

Deux-Sevres features in &quot;Son Excellence Eugene Rougon&quot;, a novel by Emile Zola in his Rougon-Macquart series, when Rougon visits Niort, the departmental capital, to open a new rail line to Angers (chapter 10).

== Geography and economics==
The climate is mild, the annual temperature averaging 11 degrees Celsius.

The &quot;département&quot; remains rural: three-quarters of the area consists of arable land. Wheat and oats are the main products grown, as well as potatoes, apples, and walnuts. Niort is the center for growing vegetables and angelica. Some beetroot is grown in the district of Melle. Vineyards are numerous in the north (), and there are some in the south.

The &quot;département&quot; is also well known for the breeding of cattle, mules, and horses. The Parthenais breed of cattle is named after the town of Parthenay in the north of the &quot;département&quot;. Also, dairy products are produced in significant quantities (butter in Échiré and goats&#x27; cheese.

Some quarries are in operation (in Mazières-en-Gâtine, La Peyratte or Saint-Varent), as well as lime extraction operations.

Textiles, leather-tanning, and flour milling were the traditional industries of Niort, the capital and major city. Nowadays, Niort, with 60,000 inhabitants, is an important commercial and administrative center.

Another important road in the north of the &quot;département&quot; is the &quot;Route nationale&quot; 149 (RN149), which runs roughly east–west from Bressuire to Poitiers, passing around the outskirts of Parthenay. This section of the RN149 forms part of the European route E62 from Nantes to Genoa. The road originally ran from Nantes, but has been bypassed in various stages by the new RN249 dual carriageway. The old section from Nantes to Bressuire has been either renamed or downgraded to the D149.

<text>Haute-Vienne (; , ; ″Upper Vienne″) is a département in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in southwest-central France. Named after the Vienne River, it is one of the twelve départements that together constitute Nouvelle-Aquitaine. The prefecture and largest city in the department is Limoges, the other towns in the department each having fewer than twenty thousand inhabitants. Haute-Vienne had a population of 372,359 in 2019.

==Geography==
Haute-Vienne is part of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. It is bordered by six departments; Creuse lies to the east, Corrèze to the south, Dordogne to the southwest, Charente to the west, Vienne to the northwest and Indre to the north. The département has two main rivers which cross it from east to west; the Vienne, on which the two main cities, Limoges and Saint-Junien, are situated, and the Gartempe, a tributary of the Creuse. To the southeast of the department lies the Massif Central, and the highest point in the department is Puy Lagarde, . The source of the Charente is in the department, in the commune of Chéronnac, near Rochechouart.

At the west end of the department is the Rochechouart impact structure, an impact crater caused by a meteorite that crashed into the Earth&#x27;s surface over 200 million years ago; because of subsequent erosion, little sign of the crater is in evidence today apart from the geologic effects on the surrounding rock.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Limoges, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 7,000 inhabitants:

===Subdivisions===
The three arrondissements of the Haute-Vienne department are:
# Arrondissement of Bellac, (subprefecture: Bellac) with 57 communes.
# Arrondissement of Limoges, (prefecture of the Haute-Vienne department: Limoges) with 108 communes.
# Arrondissement of Rochechouart, (subprefecture: Rochechouart) with 30 communes.

Haute-Vienne consists of 21 cantons.

==History==
A few Paleolithic and Mesolithic remains have been found in the department, Neolithic inhabitants are attested to by standing stones and by burial chambers, like the dolmen Chez Boucher in La Croix-sur-Gartempe, and others at Berneuil and Breuilaufa. Artefacts from the Bronze Age include axe heads found at Châlus. With the coming of the Romans, trade was opened up and gold and tin were mined. Agriculture developed and grapes were grown; amphorae for storing wine were found at Saint-Gence. During the reign of Augustus, the city of Augustoritum was founded (later to become Limoges) at a strategic ford across the Vienne. The Romans built roads from here to Brittany, Lyon and the Mediterranean. The city declined in the third century when barbarian invasions of the region took place.

The domination of the Visigoths was short-lived and Clovis I seized control of Limousin after the battle of Vouillé in 507. By 674, the region was attached to the duchy of Aquitaine, and the Viscount of Limoges was created. There followed an unsettled period with various powers vying for control. In 1199, Richard Cœur de Lion was mortally wounded during the siege of the Château de Châlus-Chabrol. The region was much involved in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and at the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360, France granted England a large area of territory comprising much of Limousin. Limoges city rebelled and gave its allegiance to the French crown, and as a result was sacked in 1370. Further troubled years followed but when peace was restored, the department benefited economically; tanneries sprang up by the Vienne, paper was produced, printing developed and the area became known for fine enamelwork. After a revolt by the peasants, Henri IV brought peace and prosperity to the region of Limousin. He visited Limoges in 1607 and was greeted enthusiastically. The Counter-Reformation led to the creation of numerous convents and religious orders, especially in Limoges. In 1761, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot was appointed &quot;intendent&quot; (tax collector) of Limoges. He negotiated a reduction in taxes payable by the region and developed fairer methods of collecting taxes, as well as improving the road system and encouraging agricultural development. Around 1765, kaolin was discovered near Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche in the south of the department, and the porcelain industry developed.

The department was created on 4 March 1790, during the French Revolution, the southern half being a subdivision of the Region of Limousin while the northern half was carved out of the county of Marche, as well as some parts of Angoumois and Poitou. At first it was given the number 81, but in the nineteenth century, the number was changed to the 87th department, when further land to the east and northeast was added. It takes its name from the upper reaches of the Vienne which flows through it. In 1998, the southwest part of the department, together with the northern part of the region of Périgord was designated as the Parc Naturel Régional Périgord-Limousin.

==Economy==
In 2013, twenty million euros were earned from agriculture in the province, as against twenty-one million three hundred thousand from Limousin. There were 351,475 cattle in Haute-Vienne, 22,780 pigs, 320,500 sheep and 6,500 goats. 723,340 hectolitres of milk were produced from cows and 30,690 hectolitres from sheep. In the same year, 1,897,800 hectares of cereals were grown and in the previous year, 12,294 hectares of land were producing organic foodstuffs.

==Demographics==
In 1801, the population of the department was 245,150. It grew steadily over the next century so that in 1901 it was 381,753. It peaked at 385,732 in 1906, fell back slightly in 1911 to 384,736 and fell sharply to 350,235 in 1921, after the Great War. By 1954 it had dwindled to 324,429 but after that it began to rise again, and in 2007 stood at 371,102.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Jean-Claude Leblois, first elected in 2015.

<text>Vosges () is a department in the Grand Est region, Northeastern France. It covers part of the Vosges mountain range, after which it is named. Vosges consists of three arrondissements, 17 cantons and 507 communes, including Domrémy-la-Pucelle, where Joan of Arc was born. In 2019, it had a population of 364,499 with an area of ; its prefecture is Épinal.

==History==
===Hundred Years&#x27; War===
Joan of Arc was born in the village of Domrémy, then in the French part of the Duchy of Bar, or &quot;Barrois mouvant&quot;, located west of the Meuse. The part of the duchy lying east of the Meuse was part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Duchy of Bar later became part of the province of Lorraine. The village of Domrémy was renamed Domrémy-la-Pucelle in honour of Joan.

===French Revolution===
The Vosges department is one of the original 83 departments of France, created on 4 March 1790 during the French Revolution. It was made of territories that had been part of the province of Lorraine. In German it is referred to as &quot;Vogesen&quot;.

In 1793, the independent Principality of Salm-Salm (town of Senones and its surroundings), enclosed inside the Vosges department, was annexed to France and incorporated into Vosges. In 1795, the area of Schirmeck was detached from the Bas-Rhin department and incorporated into the Vosges department. The Vosges department then had an area of , which it kept until 1871.

In 1794, Vosges was the site of a major battle between the forces of Revolutionary France and the Allied Coalition. The oldest square in Paris, Place Royale, was renamed Place des Vosges in 1800 when the department became the first to pay the new revolutionary taxes.

===Franco-Prussian War===
After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, 4% of the Vosges department in the extreme northeast of the department was annexed to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt on the ground that the people there spoke Germanic dialects. The area annexed on 18 May 1871 corresponded to the canton of Schirmeck and the northern half of the canton of Saales. Schirmeck and Saales had been historically part of Alsace. These territories, along with the rest of Alsace and the annexed territories of Lorraine, became part of the &quot;Reichsland&quot; of &quot;Elsaß-Lothringen&quot;. The area of the Vosges department was thus reduced to its current .

===First and Second World Wars===
In 1919, with the allied victory in the World War I, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France by Germany at the Treaty of Versailles. However, Schirmeck and Saales were not returned to the Vosges department, but instead were incorporated into the recreated Bas-Rhin department.

An ill-fated Special Air Service (SAS) mission called Operation Loyton took place in the Vosges forests in 1944.

Various military cemeteries are located in the department, the largest of which is the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial in Dinozé, near Épinal. It was built by the American 45th Infantry Division in September 1944 and completed in 1959. 5,253 soldiers killed in action during fighting in France, the Vosges, the Rhine valley and Germany are interred there.

== Geography ==

While the west part of the Vosges is flat sedimentary land (well suited for mineral waters), the east is dominated by the Vosges Mountain range and the Ballons des Vosges Nature Park. The Hohneck at 1363m is the highest peak of the Vosges department. The Monts Faucilles traverse the south of the department in a broad curve declining on the north into elevated plateaus, on the south encircling the upper basin of the River Saône. This chain, dividing the basins of the Rhône and the Rhine, forms part of the European watershed between the basins of the Mediterranean and Atlantic. 48% of the department is covered by woodlands and forests (the third highest in France), while 45% of land is in agricultural use.

The Saône (named after the Celtic goddess Sagona) rises at Vioménil, in the Vosges. The Anger river also passes through it.
===Principal towns===

The most populated commune is Épinal, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 9 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

==Culture==

The Roman fortified town of Grand, located 30 km from Toul, has an amphitheatre and a temple to the Cult of Apollo. At La Bure, located a few kilometres from Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, archaeologists have found evidence for human habitation going back to around 2000 BC.

===Séré de Rivières forts===
As a border area, the Vosges region was a route for possible invasion. As such four important forts were constructed in the department: Bourlémont Fort in Mont-les-Neufchâteau (built between 1878 and 1881); Uxegney Fort (built between 1882 and 1884); Bois l&#x27;Abbé Fort (built in 1884 and 1885); and the Le Parmont Fort in Remiremont (built between 1874 and 1876).

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is François Vannson, first elected in 2015.
