<text>Henry Agard Wallace (October 7, 1888 – November 18, 1965) was the 33rd vice president of the United States, serving from 1941 to 1945, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He served as the 11th U.S. secretary of agriculture and the 10th U.S. secretary of commerce. He was the nominee of the new Progressive Party in the 1948 presidential election.

The oldest son of Henry C. Wallace, who served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from 1921 to 1924, Wallace was born in rural Iowa in 1888. After graduating from Iowa State University in 1910, he worked as a writer and editor for his family&#x27;s farm journal, &quot;Wallaces&#x27; Farmer&quot;. He also founded the Hi-Bred Corn Company, a hybrid corn company that became extremely successful. Wallace displayed intellectual curiosity about a wide array of subjects, including statistics and economics, and explored various religious and spiritual movements, including Theosophy. After his father&#x27;s death in 1924, Wallace drifted away from the Republican Party; he supported Democratic nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election.

Wallace served as Secretary of Agriculture under Roosevelt from 1933 to 1940. He strongly supported the New Deal and presided over a major shift in federal agricultural policy, implementing measures designed to curtail agricultural surpluses and to ameliorate rural poverty. Roosevelt overcame strong opposition from conservative leaders in the Democratic Party and had Wallace nominated for vice president at the 1940 Democratic National Convention. The Roosevelt-Wallace ticket won the 1940 presidential election. At the 1944 Democratic National Convention, conservative party leaders defeated Wallace&#x27;s bid for renomination, placing Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman on the Democratic ticket instead. In early 1945, Roosevelt appointed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.

Roosevelt died in April 1945 and Truman succeeded him as president. Wallace continued to serve as Secretary of Commerce until September 1946, when he was fired by Truman for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies toward the Soviet Union. Wallace and his supporters then established the nationwide Progressive Party and launched a third-party campaign for president. The Progressive platform called for conciliatory policies toward the USSR, desegregation of public schools, racial and gender equality, a national health-insurance program, and other left-wing policies. Accusations of communist influence followed, and Wallace&#x27;s association with controversial Theosophist figure Nicholas Roerich undermined his campaign; he received just 2.4% of the popular vote. Wallace broke with the Progressive Party in 1950 over the Korean War, and in a 1952 article he called the Soviet Union &quot;utterly evil&quot;. Turning his attention back to agricultural innovation, he became a highly successful businessman. He specialized in developing and marketing hybrid seed corn and improved chickens before his death in 1965 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

==Early life and education==

Henry Agard Wallace was born on October 7, 1888, on a farm near Orient, Iowa, to Henry Cantwell Wallace and his wife, Carrie May Brodhead. Wallace had two younger brothers and three younger sisters. His paternal grandfather, &quot;Uncle Henry&quot; Wallace, was a prominent landowner, newspaper editor, Republican activist, and Social Gospel advocate in Adair County, Iowa. Uncle Henry&#x27;s father, John Wallace, was an Ulster-Scots immigrant from the village of Kilrea in County Londonderry, Ireland, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1823. May (née Broadhead) was born in New York City but was raised by an aunt in Muscatine, Iowa, after her parents&#x27; death.

Wallace&#x27;s family moved to Ames, Iowa, in 1892 and to Des Moines, Iowa, in 1896. In 1894, the Wallaces established an agricultural newspaper, &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Farmer&quot;. It became extremely successful and made the family wealthy and politically influential. Wallace took a strong interest in agriculture and plants from a young age, when his father, a professor of dairying at Iowa State Agricultural College, invited his student, African-American botanist George Washington Carver, to stay with them in the Wallace home, since Carver was barred from college housing because of his race. In gratitude, Carver took the young Henry Wallace under his wing, giving him tutorials after school on botany and plant breeding. Wallace was particularly interested in corn, Iowa&#x27;s key crop. In 1904, he devised an experiment that disproved agronomist Perry Greeley Holden&#x27;s assertion that the most aesthetically pleasing corn would produce the greatest yield. Wallace graduated from West High School in 1906 and enrolled in Iowa State College later that year, majoring in animal husbandry. He joined the Hawkeye Club, a fraternal organization, and spent much of his free time continuing to study corn. He also organized a political club to support Gifford Pinchot, a Progressive Republican who was head of the United States Forest Service.

==Journalist and farmer==
Wallace became a full-time writer and editor for &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Farmer&quot; after graduating from college in 1910. He was deeply interested in using mathematics and economics in agriculture and learned calculus as part of an effort to understand hog prices. He also wrote an influential article with pioneering statistician George W. Snedecor on computational methods for correlations and regressions. After his grandfather died in 1916, Wallace and his father became the coeditors of &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Farmer&quot;. In 1921, Wallace assumed leadership of the paper after his father accepted an appointment as Secretary of Agriculture under President Warren G. Harding. His uncle lost ownership of the paper in 1932 during the Great Depression, and Wallace stopped serving as editor in 1933.

In 1914, Wallace and his wife, Ilo Browne, purchased a farm near Johnston, Iowa; they initially attempted to combine corn production with dairy farming, but later turned their full attention to corn. Influenced by Edward Murray East, Wallace focused on producing hybrid corn, developing a variety called Copper Cross. In 1923, he reached the first-ever contract for hybrid seed production, agreeing to grant the Iowa Seed Company the sole right to grow and sell Copper Cross corn. In 1926, he co-founded the Hi-Bred Corn Company to develop and produce hybrid corn. It initially turned only a small profit, but eventually became a massive financial success.

==Early political involvement==

During World War I, Wallace and his father helped the United States Food Administration (USFA) develop policies to increase hog production. After USFA director Herbert Hoover abandoned the hog production policies the Wallaces favored, the elder Wallace joined an effort to deny Hoover the presidential nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Partly in response to Hoover, the younger Wallace published &quot;Agricultural Prices&quot;, in which he advocated government policies to control agricultural prices. He also warned farmers of an imminent price collapse after the war. Wallace&#x27;s prediction proved accurate: a farm crisis extended into the 1920s. Reflecting a broader decrease in agricultural prices, corn prices fell from $1.68 per bushel in 1918 to $0.42 per bushel in 1921. Wallace proposed various remedies to combat the farm crisis, which he believed stemmed primarily from overproduction. Among his proposed policies was the &quot;ever-normal granary&quot;: the government buys and stores agricultural surpluses when agricultural prices are low and sells them when they are high.

Both Wallaces backed the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill, which would have required the federal government to market and export agricultural surpluses in foreign markets. The bill was defeated in large part because of the opposition of President Calvin Coolidge and Commerce Secretary Hoover. When Coolidge became president after Harding died in 1923, the elder Wallace stayed on as Agriculture Secretary but died at age 58 in October 1924. His son, Henry, always blamed his father&#x27;s premature death on Hoover, because of the stress of the titanic policy battles they had over matters like the McNary-Haugen bill, with Hoover insisting on a hands-off &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude toward business and Wallace pushing more active government interventions to help farmers. In the November 1924 presidential election, Wallace voted for the Progressive nominee, Robert La Follette. Due in part to Wallace&#x27;s continued lobbying, and despite fervent opposition from Hoover, Congress passed the McNary–Haugen bill in 1927 and 1928, but Coolidge vetoed the bill both times. Dissatisfied with both major party candidates in the 1928 presidential election, Wallace advocated for the creation of a new party to unite the interests of the Western and Southern branches of the Democratic Party against its Eastern wing, but did not advance the idea beyond the conceptual stage. In the lead-up to the fall presidential election, Wallace attempted to persuade Illinois Governor Frank Lowden to run for president. He ultimately supported Democratic nominee Al Smith, but Hoover won a landslide victory. The onset of the Great Depression during Hoover&#x27;s administration devastated Iowa farmers, as farm income fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932. In the 1932 presidential election, Wallace campaigned for Democratic nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt, who favored the agricultural policies of Wallace and economist M. L. Wilson. Although his family was traditionally Republican, Wallace gradually came to support the Democratic Party, and became a registered Democrat in 1936.

==Secretary of Agriculture==
After Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, he appointed Wallace as secretary of agriculture. Despite his past affiliation with the Republican Party, Wallace strongly supported Roosevelt and his New Deal domestic program, and became a registered member of the Democratic Party in 1936. Upon taking office, Wallace appointed Rexford Tugwell, a member of Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Brain Trust&quot; of important advisers, as his deputy secretary. Though Roosevelt was initially focused primarily on addressing the banking crisis, Wallace and Tugwell convinced him of the necessity of quickly passing major agricultural reforms. Roosevelt, Wallace, and House Agriculture Committee Chairman John Marvin Jones rallied congressional support around the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). The AAA&#x27;s aim was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity by using a system of &quot;domestic allotments&quot; that set the total output of agricultural products. It paid land owners subsidies to leave some of their land idle. Farm income increased significantly in the first three years of the New Deal, as prices for commodities rose. After the Agricultural Adjustment Act passed, Agriculture became the federal government&#x27;s largest department.

The Supreme Court struck down the Agricultural Adjustment Act in the 1936 case &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;. Wallace strongly disagreed with the Court&#x27;s holding that agriculture was a &quot;purely local activity&quot; and thus could not be regulated by the federal government, saying, &quot;were agriculture truly a local matter in 1936, as the Supreme Court says it is, half of the people of the United States would quickly starve.&quot; He quickly proposed a new agriculture program designed to satisfy the Supreme Court&#x27;s objections; under the new program, the federal government would reach rental agreements with farmers to plant green manure rather than crops like corn and wheat. Less than two months after the Supreme Court decided &quot;United States v. Butler&quot;, Roosevelt signed the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936 into law. In the 1936 presidential election, Wallace was an important surrogate in Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign.

In 1935, Wallace fired general counsel Jerome Frank and some other Agriculture Department officials who sought to help Southern sharecroppers by issuing a reinterpretation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. He became more committed to aiding sharecroppers and other groups of impoverished farmers during a trip to the South in late 1936, after which he wrote, &quot;I have never seen among the peasantry of Europe poverty so abject as that which exists in this favorable cotton year in the great cotton states.&quot; He helped lead passage of the Bankhead–Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937, which authorized the federal government to issue loans to tenant farmers so that they could purchase land and equipment. The law also established the Farm Security Administration, which was charged with ameliorating rural poverty, within the Agriculture Department. He also played a key role in major New Deal successes that ended up in other cabinet departments, such as serving on the committee that got Social Security enacted in 1935 (the Committee on Economic Security, chaired by Labor Secretary Frances Perkins), and the interagency committee that designed the Civilian Conservation Corps, which created millions of public jobs in natural resource conservation and infrastructure building between 1933 and 1941 and was administered jointly by the Departments of Labor and Interior and the Army.

The failure of Roosevelt&#x27;s Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (the &quot;court-packing plan&quot;), the onset of the Recession of 1937–1938, and a wave of strikes led by John L. Lewis badly damaged the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s ability to pass major legislation after 1936. Nonetheless, Wallace helped lead passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, which implemented Wallace&#x27;s ever-normal granary plan. Between 1932 and 1940, the Agriculture Department grew from 40,000 employees and an annual budget of $280 million to 146,000 employees and an annual budget of $1.5 billion.

A Republican wave in the 1938 elections effectively brought an end to the New Deal legislative program, and the Roosevelt administration increasingly focused on foreign policy. Unlike many Midwestern progressives, Wallace supported internationalist policies, such as Secretary of State Cordell Hull&#x27;s efforts to lower tariffs. He joined Roosevelt in attacking the aggressive actions of Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan, and in one speech derided Nazi eugenics as &quot;mumbo-jumbo of dangerous nonsense&quot;. After World War II broke out in September 1939, Wallace supported Roosevelt&#x27;s program of military buildup and, anticipating hostilities with Germany, pushed for initiatives like a synthetic rubber program and closer trade relations with Latin American countries.

==Vice presidency (1941–1945)==
===Election of 1940===
As Roosevelt refused to commit to either retiring or seeking reelection during his second term, supporters of Wallace and other leading Democrats such as Vice President John Nance Garner and Postmaster General James Farley laid the groundwork for their presidential campaigns in the 1940 election. After the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, Wallace publicly endorsed Roosevelt for an unprecedented third term. Though Roosevelt never announced his candidacy, the 1940 Democratic National Convention nominated him for president. Shortly after being nominated, Roosevelt told Democratic party leaders that he would not run without Wallace as his running mate. Roosevelt chose Wallace because of his loyalty to the Roosevelt administration, his handling of aid to the United Kingdom, and because he hoped that Wallace would appeal to agricultural voters. A recent convert to the Democratic Party, Wallace was not popular among the big-city bosses and southern segregationists, and had never been tested in an election. Delegates to the 1940 Democratic convention &quot;turned ugly on Wallace&quot;, recalled Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, one of Wallace&#x27;s strongest supporters, who had previously urged Wallace to run for president if Roosevelt did not. Roosevelt&#x27;s response was to send his wife Eleanor to Chicago to convince the delegates to accept Wallace as his running mate. The result was her most famous speech, captured in the title of Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x27;s seminal book on the Roosevelt presidency, &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot;. With world war looming, she warned that &quot;this is no ordinary time&quot;, and of Wallace&#x27;s nomination, she warned that &quot;you cannot treat this as you would an ordinary nomination in an ordinary time&quot;. The speech had &quot;a magical calming effect&quot; and has been credited for Wallace&#x27;s winning the nomination by a wide margin.

Though many Democrats were disappointed by Wallace&#x27;s nomination, it was generally well received by newspapers. Arthur Krock of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Wallace was &quot;able, thoughtful, honorable–the best of the New Deal type.&quot; Wallace left office as Secretary of Agriculture in September 1940, and was succeeded by Undersecretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard. The Roosevelt campaign settled on a strategy of keeping Roosevelt largely out of the fray of the election, leaving most of the campaigning to Wallace and other surrogates. Wallace was dispatched to the Midwest, giving speeches in states like Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. He made foreign affairs the main focus of his campaigning, telling one audience that &quot;the replacement of Roosevelt ... would cause [Adolf] Hitler to rejoice.&quot; Both campaigns predicted a close election, but Roosevelt won 449 of the 531 electoral votes and the popular vote by nearly ten points.

After the election but before being sworn in as vice president, Wallace took a long trip to Mexico as FDR&#x27;s goodwill ambassador, conveying messages of Pan-Americanism and Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy. He spent much time visiting farmers in their fields, and came away appalled at Mexican farms&#x27; meager crop yields; to produce one bushel of corn, a Mexican farmer worked 500 hours, compared to the 10 hours it took an Iowa farmer using hybrid seeds from the company Wallace had founded in 1926, Pioneer Hi-Bred International. Upon his return, Wallace convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to establish an agricultural station in Mexico, the first of many such centers the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation established. Wallace recommended hiring a young Iowa agronomist, Norman Borlaug, to run the agricultural station, which ultimately led to vast increases in crop yields of corn and wheat in Mexico and around the world, in what was later called the Green Revolution, which is credited with saving two billion people from starvation and earned Borlaug the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom.

===Tenure===
Wallace was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1941. He quickly grew frustrated with his ceremonial role as the presiding officer of the United States Senate, the one duty the Constitution assigns the vice president. He had gone from running an agency with a budget of $1 billion and 146,000 employees to a budget of $11,000 and a staff of four. In July 1941, Roosevelt named Wallace chairman of the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) and of the Supply Priorities and Allocations Board (SPAB). These appointments gave him a voice in organizing national mobilization for war. One journalist noted that Roosevelt made Wallace the first &quot;Vice President to work really as the number two man in government–a conception of the vice presidency popularly held but never realized.&quot; Reflecting Wallace&#x27;s role in organizing mobilization efforts, many journalists began calling him the &quot;Assistant President.&quot; Wallace was also named to the Top Policy Group, which, just days after the Pearl Harbor attack, presented Roosevelt with a plan for the development of nuclear weapons, which Roosevelt approved and promised to fund. This became the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with Wallace serving continually as an informal link between Roosevelt and the project&#x27;s leaders.
Economic conditions became chaotic, and Roosevelt decided new leadership was needed. In early 1942 he established the War Production Board with businessman Donald Nelson in charge and Wallace as a member. Wallace continued to serve as head of the BEW, now charged with importing the raw materials such as rubber necessary for war production. He used his BEW position to demand that American purchases in Latin America raise the standard of living of the workers there. In the process he clashed privately with Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who opposed American interference in another state&#x27;s internal affairs. The national media dramatically covered Wallace&#x27;s public battle with Jesse H. Jones, the Secretary of Commerce who was also in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which paid the bills for the purchases BEW made. Roosevelt&#x27;s standard strategy for executive management was to give two different people the same role, expecting controversy would result. He wanted the agencies&#x27; heads to bring the controversy to him so he could make the decision. On August 21, 1942, Roosevelt explicitly wrote to all his department heads that disagreements &quot;should not be publicly aired, but are to be submitted to me by the appropriate heads of the conflicting agencies.&quot; Anyone going public had to resign. Wallace denounced Jones for blocking funding for purchases of raw materials in Latin America needed for the war effort. Jones called on Congress and the public for help, calling Wallace a liar. According to James MacGregor Burns, Jones, a leader of Southern conservative Democrats, was &quot;taciturn, shrewd, practical, cautious&quot;. Wallace, deeply distrusted by Democratic party leaders, was the &quot;hero of the Lib Labs, dreamy, utopian, even mystical, yet with his own bent for management and power.&quot; On July 15, 1943, Roosevelt stripped both men of their roles in the matter. BEW was reorganized as the Office of Economic Warfare, and put under Leo Crowley. The loss of the BEW was a major blow to Wallace&#x27;s prestige. He now had no agency and a weak political base on the left wing of the Democratic Party. But he still had visibility, ambition and an articulate voice, and remained a loyal Roosevelt supporter. He was not renominated for vice president but in 1945 Roosevelt fired Jones and made Wallace Secretary of Commerce.

On May 8, 1942, Wallace delivered what became his best-remembered speech, known for containing the phrase &quot;the Century of the Common Man&quot;. He cast World War II as a war between a &quot;free world&quot; and a &quot;slave world,&quot; and held that &quot;peace must mean a better standard of living for the common man, not merely in the United States and England, but also in India, Russia, China, and Latin America–not merely in the United Nations, but also in Germany and Italy and Japan&quot;. Some conservatives disliked the speech, but it was translated into 20 languages and millions of copies were distributed around the world.

In early 1943, Wallace was dispatched on a goodwill tour of Latin America; he made 24 stops across Central America and South America. Partly due to his ability to deliver speeches in Spanish, Wallace received a warm reception; one State Department official said, &quot;never in Chilean history has any foreigner ever been received with such extravagance and evidently sincere enthusiasm&quot;. During his trip, several Latin American countries declared war against Germany. Back home, Wallace continued to deliver speeches, saying after the Detroit race riot of 1943, &quot;we cannot fight to crush Nazi brutality abroad and condone race riots at home&quot;. Though Congress largely blocked Roosevelt&#x27;s domestic agenda, Wallace continued to call for progressive programs; one newspaper wrote that &quot;the New Deal today is Henry Wallace ... the New Deal banner in his hands is not yet furled&quot;. Wallace was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1943.

In mid-1944, Wallace toured the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia. The USSR presented its American guests with a fully sanitized version of gulag labor camps in Magadan and Kolyma, claiming that all the workers were volunteers. Wallace was impressed by the camp at Magadan, describing it as a &quot;combination Tennessee Valley Authority and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&quot;. He received a warm reception in the Soviet Union, but was largely unsuccessful in his efforts to negotiate with Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek. Wallace met with Mongolian leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan in Ulaanbaatar. His request to visit Gandantegchinlen Monastery is sometimes credited as having helped save the monastery from destruction.

===Election of 1944===
After the abolition of the BEW, speculation began as to whether Roosevelt would drop Wallace from the ticket in the 1944 election. Gallup polling published in March 1944 showed that Wallace was clearly the most popular choice for vice president among Democrats, and many journalists predicted that he would win renomination. As Roosevelt was in declining health, party leaders expected that the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nominee would eventually succeed Roosevelt, and Wallace&#x27;s many enemies within the Democratic Party organized to ensure his removal. Much of the opposition to Wallace stemmed from his open denunciation of racial segregation in the South, but others were concerned by Wallace&#x27;s unorthodox religious views and pro-Soviet statements. Shortly before the 1944 Democratic National Convention, party leaders such as Robert E. Hannegan and Edwin W. Pauley convinced Roosevelt to sign a document expressing support for either Associate Justice William O. Douglas or Senator Harry S. Truman for the vice-presidential nomination. Nonetheless, Wallace got Roosevelt to send a public letter to the convention chairman in which he wrote, &quot;I personally would vote for [Wallace&#x27;s] renomination if I were a delegate to the convention&quot;.

With Roosevelt not committed to keeping or dropping Wallace, the vice-presidential balloting turned into a battle between those who favored Wallace and those who favored Truman. Wallace did not have an effective organization to support his candidacy, though allies like Calvin Benham Baldwin, Claude Pepper, and Joseph F. Guffey pressed for him. Truman, meanwhile, was reluctant to put forward his own candidacy, but Hannegan and Roosevelt persuaded him to run. At the convention, Wallace galvanized supporters with a well-received speech in which he lauded Roosevelt and argued that &quot;the future belongs to those who go down the line unswervingly for the liberal principles of both political democracy and economic democracy regardless of race, color, or religion&quot;. After Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech, the crowd began chanting for the nomination of Wallace, but Samuel D. Jackson adjourned the convention for the day before Wallace supporters could call for the beginning of vice presidential balloting. Party leaders worked furiously to line up support for Truman overnight, but Wallace received 429 1/2 votes (589 were needed for nomination) on the first ballot for vice president and Truman 319 1/2, with the rest going to various favorite son candidates. On the second ballot, many delegates who had voted for favorite sons shifted into Truman&#x27;s camp, giving him the nomination.

On January 20, 1945, Wallace swore in Truman as his vice-presidential successor.

==Secretary of Commerce (1945–1946)==

Wallace believed that Democratic party leaders had unfairly stolen the vice-presidential nomination from him, but he supported Roosevelt in the 1944 presidential election. Hoping to mend ties with Wallace, Roosevelt offered him any position in the Cabinet other than secretary of state, and Wallace asked to replace Jones as secretary of commerce. In that position, Wallace expected to play a key role in the economy&#x27;s postwar transition. In January 1945, with the end of Wallace&#x27;s vice presidency, Roosevelt nominated Wallace for secretary of commerce. The nomination prompted an intense debate, as many senators objected to his support for liberal policies designed to boost wages and employment. Conservatives failed to block the nomination, but Senator Walter F. George led passage of a measure removing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from the Commerce Department. After Roosevelt signed George&#x27;s bill, Wallace was confirmed by a vote of 56 to 32 on March 1, 1945.

Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, and was succeeded by Truman. Truman quickly replaced most other senior Roosevelt appointees, but retained Wallace, who remained very popular with liberal Democrats. The discontent of liberal leaders strengthened Wallace&#x27;s position in the Cabinet; Truman privately stated that the two most important members of his &quot;political team&quot; were Wallace and Eleanor Roosevelt. As secretary of commerce, Wallace advocated a &quot;middle course&quot; between the planned economy of the Soviet Union and the laissez-faire economics that had dominated the United States before the Great Depression. With his congressional allies, he led passage of the Employment Act of 1946. Conservatives blocked the inclusion of a measure providing for full employment, but the act established the Council of Economic Advisers and the Joint Economic Committee to study economic matters. Wallace&#x27;s proposal to establish international control over nuclear weapons was not adopted, but he did help pass the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which established the United States Atomic Energy Commission to oversee domestic development of nuclear power.

World War II ended in September 1945 with the surrender of Japan, and relations with the USSR became a central matter of foreign policy. Various issues, including the fate of European and Asian postwar governments and the administration of the United Nations, had already begun to strain the wartime alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States. Critics of the USSR objected to the oppressive satellite states it had established in Eastern Europe and Soviet involvement in the Greek Civil War and the Chinese Civil War. In February 1946, George F. Kennan laid out the doctrine of containment, which called for the United States to resist the spread of Communism. Wallace feared that confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union would eventually lead to war, and urged Truman to &quot;allay any reasonable Russian grounds for fear, suspicion, and distrust&quot;. Historian Tony Judt wrote in &quot;&quot; that Wallace&#x27;s &quot;distaste for American involvement with Britain and Europe was widely shared across the political spectrum&quot;.

Though Wallace was dissatisfied with Truman&#x27;s increasingly confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union, he remained an integral part of Truman&#x27;s Cabinet during the first half of 1946. He broke with administration policies in September 1946 when he delivered a speech in which he stated that &quot;we should recognize that we have no more business in the political affairs of Eastern Europe than Russia has in the political affairs of Latin America, Western Europe and the United States&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s speech was booed by the pro-Soviet crowd he delivered it to and even more strongly criticized by Truman administration officials and leading Republicans like Robert A. Taft and Arthur Vandenberg. Truman stated that Wallace&#x27;s speech did not represent administration policy but merely Wallace&#x27;s personal views, and on September 20 he demanded and received Wallace&#x27;s resignation.

==1948 presidential election==
Shortly after leaving office, Wallace became the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, a progressive magazine. He also helped establish the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA), a progressive political organization that called for good relations with the Soviet Union and more liberal programs at home. Though not a member of the PCA, Wallace was widely regarded as the organization&#x27;s leader and was criticized for the PCA&#x27;s acceptance of Communist members. In response to the creation of the PCA, anti-Communist liberals established a rival group, Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), which explicitly rejected any association with Communism. Wallace strongly criticized the president in early 1947 after Truman promulgated the Truman Doctrine to oppose Communist threats to Greece and Turkey. Wallace also opposed Truman&#x27;s Executive Order 9835, which began a purge of government workers affiliated Communist groups deemed to be subversive. He initially favored the Marshall Plan, but later opposed it because he believed the program should have been administered through the United Nations. Wallace and the PCA were scrutinized by the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, both of which sought to uncover evidence of Communist influence.

Robert W. Kenny, the former Attorney General of California, launched an effort to elect delegates pledged to Wallace for the 1948 Democratic National Convention. If this effort failed then they would launch a third-party campaign with Wallace as their presidential nominee.

Many in the PCA favored the establishment of a third party, but other longtime Wallace allies warned him against leaving the Democratic Party. On December 29, 1947, Wallace launched a third-party campaign, declaring, &quot;we have assembled a Gideon&#x27;s Army, small in number, powerful in conviction ... We face the future unfettered, unfettered by any principle but the general welfare&quot;. He was backed by many intellectuals and Hollywood and Broadway celebrities. Among his prominent supporters were Rexford Tugwell, Congressmen Vito Marcantonio and Leo Isacson, actress Ava Gardner, musicians Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger, and future presidential nominee George McGovern. Calvin Baldwin became Wallace&#x27;s campaign manager and took charge of fundraising and ensuring that Wallace appeared on as many state ballots as possible. Wallace&#x27;s first choice for running mate, Claude Pepper, refused to leave the Democratic Party. O. John Rogge actively sought to be Wallace&#x27;s running mate, but was from the same state as Wallace, which would prevent New York electors from voting for them. Rogge was also unknown outside the eastern United States. Democratic Senator Glen H. Taylor of Idaho agreed to serve as Wallace&#x27;s running mate.

Wallace accepted the endorsement of the American Communist Party, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not following their line. If they want to follow my line, I say God bless &#x27;em&quot;. Truman responded to Wallace&#x27;s left-wing challenge by pressing for liberal domestic policies, while pro-ADA liberals like Hubert Humphrey, Robert F. Wagner, and James Roosevelt linked Wallace to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. Many Americans came to see Wallace as a fellow traveler to Communists, a view reinforced by Wallace&#x27;s refusal to condemn the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état. In early 1948, the CIO and the AFL both rejected Wallace, with the AFL denouncing him as a &quot;front, spokesman, and apologist for the Communist Party&quot;. With Wallace&#x27;s foreign policy views overshadowing his domestic policy views, many liberals who had previously favored his candidacy returned to the Democratic fold.

Wallace embarked on a nationwide speaking tour to support his candidacy, encountering resistance in both the North and South. He openly defied the Jim Crow regime in the South, refusing to speak before segregated audiences. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which opposed Wallace&#x27;s candidacy, described him as &quot;ostentatiously&quot; riding through the towns and cities of the segregated South &quot;with his Negro secretary beside him&quot;. A barrage of eggs and tomatoes were hurled at Wallace and struck him and his campaign members during the tour. State authorities in Virginia sidestepped enforcing their own segregation laws by declaring Wallace&#x27;s campaign gatherings private parties. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; began publishing the names of known Wallace supporters. Scores of Wallace supporters in colleges and high schools lost their positions. A supporter of Zionism, Wallace sought to deny Truman Jewish votes by promising to end the arms embargo on Israel, which was currently fighting the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

With strong financial support from Anita McCormick Blaine, Wallace exceeded fundraising goals, and appeared on the ballot of every state except for Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Illinois. The campaign distributed 25 million copies of 140 fliers and pamphlets. Nevertheless, Gallup polls showed support for Wallace falling from 7% in December 1947 to 5% in June 1948. He was endorsed by only two newspapers: the Communist &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in New York and &quot;The Gazette and Daily&quot; in York, Pennsylvania. Some in the press began to speculate that Wallace would drop out of the race.

Wallace&#x27;s supporters held a national convention in Philadelphia in July, formally establishing a new Progressive Party. The party platform addressed a wide array of issues, and included support for the desegregation of public schools, gender equality, a national health insurance program, free trade, and public ownership of large banks, railroads, and power utilities. The party was described as &quot;progressively capitalist&quot;. Another part of the platform stated, &quot;responsibility for ending the tragic prospect of war is a joint responsibility of the Soviet Union and the United States&quot;. During the convention, Wallace faced questioning regarding letters he had written to guru Nicholas Roerich; his refusal to comment on the letters was widely criticized. Wallace was further damaged days after the convention when Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee that several government officials associated with Wallace (including Alger Hiss and John Abt) were Communist infiltrators. Meanwhile, many Southern Democrats, outraged by the Democratic Party&#x27;s pro-civil rights plank, bolted the party and nominated Strom Thurmond for president. With the Democrats badly divided, Republicans were confident that Republican nominee Thomas Dewey would win the election. Wallace himself predicted that Truman would be &quot;the worst defeated candidate in history&quot;.

Though polls consistently showed him losing the race, Truman ran an effective campaign against Dewey and the conservative 80th United States Congress. He ultimately defeated Dewey in both the popular and electoral vote. Wallace won just 2.38 percent of the nationwide popular vote and failed to carry any state. His best performance was in New York, where he won eight percent of the vote. Just one of the party&#x27;s congressional candidates, incumbent Congressman Vito Marcantonio, won election. Wallace traveled over 55,000 miles during the campaign. Though Wallace and Thurmond probably took many voters from Truman, their presence in the race may have boosted the president&#x27;s overall appeal by casting him as the candidate of the center-left. In response to the election results, Wallace stated, &quot;Unless this bi-partisan foreign policy of high prices and war is promptly reversed, I predict that the Progressive Party will rapidly grow into the dominant party. ... To save the peace of the world the Progressive Party is more needed than ever before&quot;.

Historians Edward Schapsmeier and Frederick Schapsmeier argue:The Progressive party stood for one thing and Wallace another. Actually the party organization was controlled from the outset by those representing the radical left and not liberalism per se. This made it extremely easy for Communists and fellow travelers to infiltrate into important positions within the party machinery. Once this happened, party stands began to resemble a party line. Campaign literature, speech materials, and campaign slogans sounded strangely like echoes of what Moscow wanted to hear. As if wearing moral blinkers, Wallace increasingly became an imperceptive ideologue. Words were uttered by Wallace that did not sound like him, and his performance took on a strange Jekyll and Hyde quality—one moment he was a peace protagonist and the next a propaganda parrot for the Kremlin.

==Later politics==

Wallace initially remained active in politics following the 1948 campaign, and he delivered the keynote address at the 1950 Progressive National Convention. In early 1949, Wallace testified before Congress in the hope of preventing the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, which established the NATO alliance between the United States, Canada, and several European countries. He became increasingly critical of the Soviet Union after 1948, and he resigned from the Progressive Party in August 1950 due to his support for the UN intervention in the Korean War. After leaving the Progressive Party, Wallace endured what biographers John Culver and John Hyde describe as a &quot;long, slow decline into obscurity marked by a certain acceptance of his outcast status&quot;.

In the early 1950s, he spent much of his time rebutting attacks by prominent public figures such as General Leslie Groves, who claimed to have stopped providing Wallace with information regarding the Manhattan Project because he considered Wallace to be a security risk. In 1951, Wallace appeared before Congress to deny accusations that in 1944 he had encouraged a coalition between Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists. In 1952, he published an article, &quot;Where I Was Wrong&quot;, in which he repudiated his earlier foreign policy positions and declared the Soviet Union to be &quot;utterly evil&quot;.
Wallace did not endorse a candidate in the 1952 presidential election, but in the 1956 presidential election he endorsed incumbent Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower over Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson. Wallace, who maintained a correspondence with Eisenhower, described Eisenhower as &quot;utterly sincere&quot; in his efforts for peace. Wallace also began a correspondence with Vice President Richard Nixon, but he declined to endorse either Nixon or Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. Though Wallace criticized Kennedy&#x27;s farm policy during the 1960 campaign, Kennedy invited Wallace to his 1961 inauguration, the first presidential inauguration Wallace had attended since 1945. Wallace later wrote Kennedy, &quot;at no time in our history have so many tens of millions of people been so completely enthusiastic about an inaugural address as about yours&quot;. In 1962, he delivered a speech commemorating the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the Department of Agriculture. He also began a correspondence with President Lyndon B. Johnson regarding methods to alleviate rural poverty, though privately he criticized Johnson&#x27;s escalation of American involvement in the Vietnam War. In the 1964 election, Wallace returned to the Democratic fold, supporting Johnson over Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. Due to declining health, he made his last public appearance that year; in one of his last speeches, he stated, &quot;We lost Cuba in 1959 not only because of Castro but also because we failed to understand the needs of the farmer in the back country of Cuba from 1920 onward. ... The common man is on the march, but it is up to the uncommon men of education and insight to lead that march constructively&quot;.

== Business success ==

Wallace continued to co-own and take an interest in the company he had established, Pioneer Hi-Bred (formerly the Hi-Bred Corn Company), and he established an experimental farm at his New York estate. He focused much of his efforts on the study of chickens, and Pioneer Hi-Bred&#x27;s chickens at one point produced three-quarters of all commercially sold eggs worldwide. He also wrote or co-wrote several works on agriculture, including a book on the history of corn.

==Illness and death==

Wallace was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1964, at the age of 76. He consulted numerous specialists and tried various methods of treating the disease, stating, &quot;I look on myself as an ALS guinea-pig, willing to try almost anything&quot;. He died in Danbury, Connecticut, on November 18, 1965, at the age of 77. His remains were cremated and the ashes interred in Glendale Cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa.

==Family==

In 1913, Wallace met Ilo Browne, the daughter of a successful businessman from Indianola, Iowa. Wallace and Browne married on May 20, 1914, and had three children. Henry Browne (b. 1915), Robert Browne (b. 1918), and Jean Browne (b. 1920). Wallace and his family lived in Des Moines until Wallace accepted appointment as secretary of agriculture, at which point they began living in an apartment at Wardman Park in Washington, D.C. In 1945, Wallace and his wife purchased a 115-acre farm near South Salem, New York, known as Farvue. Ilo was supportive of her husband&#x27;s career and enjoyed serving as Second Lady of the United States from 1941 to 1945, though she was uncomfortable with many of Wallace&#x27;s Progressive supporters during his 1948 presidential campaign. Wallace and Ilo remained married until his death in 1965; she lived until 1981. In 1999, Wallace&#x27;s three children sold their shares in Pioneer Hi-Bred to DuPont for well over $1 billion. Wallace&#x27;s grandson, Scott Wallace, won the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the 2018 elections. He was defeated by Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick in the general election.

==Mysticism and Roerich controversy==
Wallace was raised a Calvinist but showed an interest in other religious teachings during his life. He was deeply interested in religion from a young age, reading works by authors like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ralph Waldo Trine, and William James, whose &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; had a particularly strong impact on Wallace. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1916, he left the Presbyterian Church and became increasingly interested in mysticism. He later said, &quot;I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church I was probably a practical mystic… I&#x27;d say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and therefore, if you went to God, you could find the answers&quot;. Wallace began regularly attending meetings of the pantheistic Theosophical Society, and, in 1925, he helped organize the Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church. Wallace left the Liberal Catholic Church in 1930 and joined the Episcopal Church, but he continued to be interested in various mystic groups and individuals.

Among those with whom Wallace corresponded were author George William Russell, astrologer L. Edward Johndro, and Edward Roos, who took on the persona of a Native American medicine man. In the early 1930s, Wallace began corresponding with Nicholas Roerich, a prominent Russian émigré, artist, peace activist, and Theosophist. With Wallace&#x27;s support, Roerich was appointed to lead a federal expedition to the Gobi Desert to collect drought-resistant grasses. Roerich&#x27;s expedition ended in a public fiasco, and Roerich fled to India after the Internal Revenue Service launched a tax investigation.

The letters that Wallace wrote to Roerich from 1933 to 1934 were eventually acquired by Republican newspaper publisher Paul Block. The Republicans threatened to reveal to the public what they characterized as Wallace&#x27;s bizarre religious beliefs before the November 1940 elections but were deterred when the Democrats countered by threatening to release information about Republican candidate Wendell Willkie&#x27;s rumored extramarital affair with the writer Irita Van Doren. The contents of the letters did become public seven years later, in the winter of 1947, when right-wing columnist Westbrook Pegler published what were purported to be extracts from them as evidence that Wallace was a &quot;messianic fumbler&quot;, and &quot;off-center mentally&quot;. During the 1948 campaign Pegler and other hostile reporters, including H. L. Mencken, aggressively confronted Wallace on the subject at a public meeting in Philadelphia in July. Wallace declined to comment, accusing the reporters of being Pegler&#x27;s stooges. Many press outlets were critical of Wallace&#x27;s association with Roerich; one newspaper mockingly wrote that if Wallace became president &quot;we shall get in tune with the Infinite, vibrate in the correct plane, outstare the Evil Eye, reform the witches, overcome all malicious spells and ascend the high road to health and happiness&quot;.

Henry Wallace reportedly dabbled in Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.

==Legacy==

During his time in the Roosevelt administration, Wallace became a controversial figure, attracting a mix of praise and criticism for various actions. He remains a controversial figure today. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. pronounced Wallace to be both &quot;an incorrigibly naive politician&quot; and &quot;the best secretary of agriculture the country has ever had&quot;. Journalist Peter Beinart writes that Wallace&#x27;s &quot;naive faith in U.S.-Soviet cooperation&quot; damaged his legacy. Historian Andrew Seal lauds Wallace for his focus on combating both economic and racial inequality. Wallace&#x27;s vision of the &quot;Century of the Common Man&quot;, which denied American exceptionalism in foreign policy, continues to influence the foreign policy of individuals like Bernie Sanders. In 2013, historian Thomas W. Devine wrote that &quot;newly available Soviet sources do confirm Wallace&#x27;s position that Moscow&#x27;s behavior was not as relentlessly aggressive as many believed at the time&quot;. Yet Devine also writes that &quot;enough new information has come to light to cast serious doubt both on Wallace&#x27;s benign attitude toward Stalin&#x27;s intentions and on his dark, conspiratorial view of the Truman administration&quot;.

Alex Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writes, &quot;with the exception of Al Gore, Wallace remains the most famous almost-president in American history&quot;. Journalist Jeff Greenfield writes that the 1944 Democratic National Convention was one of the most important political events of the twentieth century, since the leading contenders for the nomination might have governed in vastly different ways. In &quot;The Untold History of the United States&quot;, Oliver Stone argues that, had Wallace become president in 1945, &quot;there might have been no atomic bombings, no nuclear arms race, and no Cold War&quot;. By contrast, Ron Capshaw of the conservative &quot;National Review&quot; argues that a President Wallace would have practiced a policy of appeasement that would have allowed the spread of Communism into countries like Iran, Greece, and Italy.

The Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, the largest agricultural research complex in the world, is named for him. Wallace founded the Wallace Genetic Foundation to support agricultural research. His son, Robert, founded the Wallace Global Fund to support sustainable development. A speech Wallace delivered in 1942 inspired Aaron Copland to compose &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum&#x27;s grounds in Hyde Park, New York, include the Henry A. Wallace Visitor and Education Center at its north end.

<text>Alben William Barkley (; November 24, 1877 – April 30, 1956) was an American lawyer and politician from Kentucky who served as the 35th vice president of the United States from 1949 to 1953 under President Harry S. Truman. In 1905, he was elected to local offices and in 1912 as a U.S. representative. Serving in both houses of Congress, he was a liberal Democrat, supporting President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s New Freedom domestic agenda and foreign policy.

Endorsing Prohibition and denouncing parimutuel betting, Barkley narrowly lost the Kentucky Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1923 to fellow representative J. Campbell Cantrill. In 1926, he unseated Republican senator Richard P. Ernst. In the Senate, he supported the New Deal approach to handling the Great Depression in the United States. Democrats chose him to succeed Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson upon Robinson&#x27;s death in 1937. His 1938 re-election bid was an intense, bitter victory against Governor A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler. When World War II focused President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s attention on foreign affairs, Barkley gained influence over the administration&#x27;s domestic agenda. He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the Revenue Act of 1943. The veto was overridden by both houses and the Democratic senators unanimously re-elected Barkley to the position of Majority Leader.

Barkley had a good working relationship with Senator Harry S. Truman, who became vice-president and then president in 1945. With Truman&#x27;s popularity waning entering the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Barkley gave a keynote address that energized the delegates. Truman selected him as his running mate for the upcoming election, and the Democratic ticket scored an upset victory against Thomas Dewey and Earl Warren of the Republican Party. Barkley took an active role in the Truman administration, acting as its primary spokesman, especially after the Korean War required the majority of Truman&#x27;s attention. When Truman announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952, Barkley began organizing a presidential campaign, but labor leaders refused to endorse his candidacy because of his age, and he withdrew from the race. He is the most recent Democratic vice president to never receive the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. He retired but was coaxed back into public life, defeating incumbent Republican senator John Sherman Cooper in 1954. Barkley died of a heart attack on April 30, 1956.

==Early life and education==
Willie Alben Barkley, the eldest of eight children of John Wilson Barkley (1854–1932) and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley (1858–1945), was born November 24, 1877. His grandmother, midwife Amanda Barkley, delivered him in the log house she lived in with her husband, Alben, in Wheel, Kentucky. Barkley&#x27;s parents were tenant farmers who grew tobacco, and his father was an elder in the local Presbyterian church. Barkley traced his father&#x27;s ancestry to Scots-Irish Presbyterians in Rowan County, North Carolina. Both parents were religious, opposed to playing cards and alcohol. Occasionally, Barkley&#x27;s parents would leave him in the care of his grandparents for extended periods. During these times, his grandmother related stories of her relatives. Her childhood playmates included future U.S. Vice President Adlai Stevenson I and James A. McKenzie, a future U.S. representative from Kentucky.

Barkley worked on his parents&#x27; farm and attended school in Lowes, Kentucky, between the fall harvest and spring planting. Unhappy with his birth name, he adopted &quot;Alben William&quot; as soon as he was old enough to express his opinion in the matter. In the difficult economy of late 1891, relatives convinced Barkley&#x27;s father to sell his farm and move to Clinton, to pursue opportunities as a tenant wheat farmer. Barkley enrolled at a local seminary school, but did not finish his studies before entering Marvin College, a Methodist school in Clinton that accepted younger students, in 1892. The college&#x27;s president offered him a scholarship that covered his academic expenses in exchange for his work as a janitor. He allowed Barkley to miss the first and last month of the academic year to help on the family farm. Barkley was active in the debating society at Marvin. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897, and his experiences at Marvin persuaded him to convert to Methodism, the denomination with which he identified for the rest of his life.

After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the &quot;alma mater&quot; of several administrators and faculty members at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 academic year, he was active in the debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.

== Early career ==
In Paducah, Barkley worked as a law clerk for Charles K. Wheeler, an attorney and congressman, accepting access to Wheeler&#x27;s law library as payment for his services. Despite their political differences – Wheeler supported William Jennings Bryan and Free Silver, while Barkley identified with the Gold Democrats – he hoped that being acquainted with and taught by Wheeler would aid him in his future endeavors, but congressional duties frequently kept Wheeler away from the office. After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former congressman John Kerr Hendrick, who paid him $15 per month. He read law while completing his duties and was admitted to the bar in 1901. Barkley practiced in Paducah where a friend of Hendrick&#x27;s appointed him reporter of the circuit court. He continued studying law in the summer of 1902 at the University of Virginia School of Law.

On December 19, 1904, Barkley declared his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County well before the March 1905 Democratic primary. The Republicans did not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the &quot;de facto&quot; general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County&#x27;s rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This was the only time Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.

Taking office in January 1906, Barkley saved taxpayers over $35,000 by challenging improper charges to the county. He prosecuted two magistrates for approving contracts in which they had a conflict of interest. Even Republicans admitted that he performed well, and he was chosen president of the State Association of County Attorneys. During the 1907 gubernatorial campaign, he was the Democratic county spokesman, and despite his previous support for the Gold Democrats, he backed William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. Friends encouraged him to run for county judge, a powerful position which controlled county funds and patronage, and he announced his candidacy on August 22, 1908. After the chairman of the county&#x27;s Democratic Club Executive Committee endorsed him, the incumbent judge, Richard T. Lightfoot, retired rather than challenge him.

On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, was indicted for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was appointed to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county&#x27;s Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley&#x27;s surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley was arrested and charged with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county&#x27;s finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley&#x27;s opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county&#x27;s entire Democratic organization was corrupt, and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county&#x27;s finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley&#x27;s victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.

At the Fiscal Court&#x27;s January 1910 meeting, Barkley laid out an agenda to reduce the county&#x27;s debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the Republican majority on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county, and allocated a salary for the county&#x27;s almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and graveling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah&#x27;s amenities but reduced funds for programs such as free textbooks for indigents, and prevented Barkley from reducing the county&#x27;s debt as planned. When he named his father as the county&#x27;s juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.

==U.S. Representative (1913–1927)==
Prompted by First District representative Ollie M. James&#x27; decision to seek election to the U.S. Senate in 1912, Barkley declared his candidacy for the district&#x27;s congressional seat in December 1911. Courting the votes of the district&#x27;s farmers, Barkley advocated lower taxes and increased regulation of railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission. After one challenger withdrew in March, three more candidates entered the race – Trigg County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney Denny Smith, Ballard County Judge Jacob Corbett, and John K. Hendrick, Barkley&#x27;s former employer. All were conservative Democrats who branded Barkley a socialist because he supported federal funding of highway construction. Hendrick attacked Barkley&#x27;s youth, inexperience and ambition to seek higher offices. Barkley admitted his eventual desire for a Senate seat, and countered that Hendrick had also frequently sought office: &quot;When the Pope died some years ago, nobody would tell Hendrick, for fear he would declare for that office.&quot; Charging that Barkley&#x27;s membership in Woodmen of the World was politically motivated, Hendrick ended up attacking the organization itself, angering the approximately 5,000 club members in the First District. In June, the nomination of Woodrow Wilson for president and adoption of a progressive platform at the 1912 Democratic National Convention bolstered Barkley&#x27;s candidacy. He won 48.2% of the votes in the primary and went on to win the general election.

===Domestic matters===

Initially conservative, working with Wilson (who was elected president) inspired Barkley to become more liberal. On April 24, 1913, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson&#x27;s New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act. Because of his support for the administration, he was assigned to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, he supported the Clayton Antitrust Act and sought to end child labor in interstate commerce through the Keating–Owen Act in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.

A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-sponsored the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act, which banned alcohol sales in Washington, D.C. It was passed in 1917. He sponsored an amendment to the Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley&#x27;s national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists&#x27; enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction&#x27;s attempts to recruit him to challenge anti-prohibitionist Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic Senate primary.

By 1919, James had died in office, and Governor Augustus Owsley Stanley was elected to his vacant seat. The divisive prohibition issue and recent Republican gains in the state made the Democratic gubernatorial primary of particular interest. Stanley was the leader of the party&#x27;s anti-prohibitionists. Prohibitionists, led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham, did not support James D. Black, who became governor when Stanley went to the Senate and was seeking re-election. At the time of Black&#x27;s election as lieutenant governor in 1915, he had sided with the prohibitionists; he was chosen to run with Stanley to balance the party&#x27;s ticket, so the anti-prohibitionists did not entirely trust him either. Attempting to unite the party and prevent a Republican victory, Black invited Barkley, who had not been linked to either leader despite his support for prohibition, to be temporary chairman of the 1919 state Democratic convention. Barkley&#x27;s convention address attacked Republicans and praised the Democrats&#x27; record without making reference to prohibition, but many in the Beckham faction refused to accept Black, and he was defeated in the general election by Republican Edwin P. Morrow. Chairing the convention introduced Barkley to state political leaders outside the First District.

===World War I===
Barkley supported U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson&#x27;s plan to purchase merchant ships for the U.S. instead of paying foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.

Wilson supporters, including Barkley, campaigned for his re-election in 1916, using the slogan &quot;he kept us out of war&quot;. By early 1917, Germany had lifted all restrictions on attacks on neutral shipping supplying Britain and France, outraging many Americans. The publication in February of the Zimmermann Telegram, in which a German official proposed to Mexico that, if the U.S. entered the war, Mexico should declare war on them and the Germans would work to return Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico to Mexican control, also brought the United States closer to war. Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, and Barkley voted for the resolution when it came before the House two weeks later. At 40 years old, he considered resigning his seat to enlist in the U.S. Army, but Wilson persuaded him not to do so.

After the declaration of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after the election of a more conservative Congress in 1918.

===Relations with Harding administration===
Barkley supported William Gibbs McAdoo for president at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, but the nomination went to James M. Cox. He campaigned for Cox and his running mate, Franklin D. Roosevelt, but his speeches focused more on Wilson&#x27;s progressive record than Cox&#x27;s fitness for office. Republican Warren G. Harding defeated Cox in the general election, and Barkley found common ground with him on issues such as the creation of the Veterans&#x27; Bureau and the passage of the progressive Sheppard–Towner Act. Barkley thought the administration was too favorable to big business interests, however, and in 1922 he proclaimed that if Harding had returned the country to normalcy, &quot;then in God&#x27;s name let us have Abnormalcy&quot;.

===Gubernatorial election of 1923===
By the time of his 1922 re-election bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of Caldwell and Crittenden counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.
Opposing Barkley in the primary was Congressman J. Campbell Cantrill who, along with Stanley, led the conservative wing of the party, opposing prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage. Beckham, leader of the liberal wing, intended to run, and his surrogates, particularly &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; editor Robert Worth Bingham, began a &quot;Business Man for Governor&quot; campaign in late 1922. Beckham had served as governor from 1900 to 1907 and later in the U.S. Senate, but he was out of office (a &quot;Business Man&quot;), in contrast to Cantrill and Barkley. While Bingham&#x27;s campaign forced Barkley to declare his candidacy earlier than planned, the tactic was not successful outside Louisville; Beckham supporters backed Barkley, more to prevent Cantrill&#x27;s nomination than because they desired Barkley&#x27;s. Barkley&#x27;s leadership team included his own supporters, influential members of the Beckham faction, and erstwhile Cantrill supporters.

Recognizing the need to broaden his appeal beyond western Kentucky, Barkley opened his campaign in the central Kentucky town of Danville on February 19, 1923. He employed the slogan &quot;Christianity, Morality, and Good Government&quot;, and he and Cantrill – colleagues in the House – agreed to refrain from personal attacks. Due to Percy Haly&#x27;s influence on Barkley, and Barkley&#x27;s own admiration for Woodrow Wilson, he denounced the influence of the coal, racing, and railroad trusts in state politics. &quot;Woodrow Wilson drove the crooks and corruptionists out of New Jersey, Governor Pinchot is driving them out of Pennsylvania, and if I am elected Governor of Kentucky I promise to drive them out of Frankfort,&quot; he declared. In contrast to his usual preference for low taxes, he advocated a tax on coal deposits. In addition to reducing the coal trust&#x27;s political influence, he believed the increased revenue, which would largely be generated by out-of-state coal buyers, would result in lower property taxes on farmers. Friends in the Anti-Saloon League convinced him that banning parimutuel betting would cripple the racing trust. Many Catholics and Protestants – notably those affiliated with the Louisville Churchmen&#x27;s Federation – favored prohibition and opposed parimutuel betting on religious grounds, and endorsed Barkley&#x27;s candidacy, but Bingham, typically a Beckham ally, was slow to endorse him. Like Bingham, &quot;Lexington Herald&quot; editor Desha Breckinridge had helped create the parimutuel betting system, and Barkley&#x27;s positions were enough to convince him to back Cantrill, despite the fact that Breckinridge generally disliked Cantrill.

Barkley campaigned across the state, earning the nickname &quot;Iron Man&quot; for making up to 16 speeches in a day. His proposals for a statewide highway system and improvements in education were popular, but coal mining and horse racing interests, based mostly in eastern Kentucky, opposed him. Counties east of a line from Louisville to Middlesboro generally supported Cantrill, while those west of the line mostly went for Barkley, who lost the primary by 9,000 votes (out of 241,000 cast), marking his only election loss. He supported Cantrill in the general election, gaining goodwill within the Democratic Party. Cantrill died on September 2, and the Democratic State Committee had to name his replacement. Barkley was not acceptable to many of the members of the committee, and he refused to accept nomination by party leaders instead of the voters. On September 11, the committee nominated Congressman William J. Fields, and Barkley supported him in the general election, which he won over Republican Charles I. Dawson.

===Later House career===
Barkley&#x27;s party loyalty in the governor&#x27;s race made him a formidable candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley had spent most of his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and he did not want to risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky&#x27;s incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.

At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, Barkley again supported William G. McAdoo for president. Urban interests at the convention promoted New York Governor Al Smith, and a bitter convention fight ensued. During the course of 103 ballots, chairman Thomas J. Walsh needed a rest and temporarily yielded his position to Barkley. The convention was the first to be broadcast nationally, and Barkley&#x27;s service as chair augmented his national recognition and appeal. The two Democratic factions agreed to compromise, nominating John W. Davis, who Libbey called a &quot;competent nonentity&quot;; Davis lost in the general election to incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Barkley won another term in the House by a 2-to-1 margin over his Republican opponent in 1924, but Democratic divisions cost Stanley his Senate seat, and Barkley became even more convinced of the value of party loyalty.

==U.S. Senator (1927–1949, 1955–1956)==

Because of Barkley&#x27;s role in crafting the Railway Labor Act, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him to unseat Ernst even before he formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had distanced himself from Haly and promised the conservatives that he would not push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later Chief Justice) Fred M. Vinson managed his general election campaign.

Coolidge supported Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in the state on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst&#x27;s affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley&#x27;s support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won by a vote of 287,997 to 266,657.

In the Senate, Barkley was assigned to the Committee on the Library, and the committees on Finance and Banking and Currency; later, he was added to the Commerce Committee. In early 1928, Vice President Charles G. Dawes assigned him to a special committee to investigate the campaign expenditures of the leading candidates in the upcoming presidential election.
Democrats considered nominating him for vice president that year, calculating that his party loyalty and appeal to rural, agricultural and prohibitionist constituents could balance a ticket headed by likely presidential nominee Al Smith, an urban anti-prohibitionist. When the Kentucky delegation arrived at the 1928 Democratic National Convention, they approached Smith supporters with a view to pairing Barkley to their candidate. They were received cordially, but Smith&#x27;s advisors thought placing candidates with such differing views on the ticket would seem contrived to the electorate. They did not tell Barkley of their decision until after he seconded Smith&#x27;s nomination for president. Smith then announced Arkansas senator Joseph T. Robinson as his preferred running mate. The Kentuckians nominated Barkley in spite of Smith&#x27;s preference, but the overwhelming majority of delegates voted for Robinson, and Barkley announced that Kentucky was changing its support in order to make the nomination unanimous.

Barkley and his wife Dorothy took a vacation after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith&#x27;s campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover&#x27;s use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He was impressed by the industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.

Barkley maintained that Hoover&#x27;s response to the continuing depression and the severe drought in 1930 were inadequate, and pointed out that the $45 million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to less than half the losses sustained by Kentucky&#x27;s farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special congressional session to adopt relief measures after the 71st Congress adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June, but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities for the remainder of the year.

===Second term and ascension to floor leader===

Barkley supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, he did not announce his support, fearing that his message might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley&#x27;s re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced more than a decade of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.

George B. Martin, who had served six months in the Senate in 1918 after being appointed to fill a vacancy, opposed Barkley in the 1932 primary, but Barkley defeated him by a two-to-one margin. In the general election, he defeated Republican Congressman Maurice H. Thatcher by a vote of 575,077 to 393,865, marking the first time in the 20th century that a Kentucky senator won a second consecutive term. Democrats gained control of the Senate during the 1932 elections; Joseph Robinson was chosen majority leader, and he appointed Barkley as his assistant. Together, they secured passage of New Deal legislation, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Federal Emergency Relief Act. In July 1934, the Democratic National Committee chose Barkley to respond to Republican National Committee chairman Henry P. Fletcher&#x27;s radio attacks on the New Deal. Later that year, he embarked on a tour of twenty states, defending the New Deal and stumping for Democratic candidates in the 1934 midterm elections.

Barkley was again the keynote speaker at the 1936 Democratic National Convention. During his address, he alluded to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot; – which struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act as unconstitutional – asking &quot;Is the court beyond criticism? May it be regarded as too sacred to be disagreed with?&quot; These remarks help set an anti-Supreme Court tone for Roosevelt&#x27;s second term. On February 5, 1937, Roosevelt proposed legislation authorizing the president to appoint an additional justice for each one over the age of 70. Many saw this proposal as an attempt to avoid further nullification of New Deal provisions as unconstitutional by appointing more sympathetic justices, and they dubbed the measure Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;court-packing plan&quot;.
Barkley and Mississippi Senator Pat Harrison were the leading candidates to succeed Robinson as Democratic floor leader when he died on July 14, 1937. Harrison&#x27;s tenure in the Senate was eight years longer than Barkley&#x27;s, and he was supported by conservative Southern Democratic senators opposed to Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing plan. Harrison had helped secure Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination at the 1932 Democratic National Convention by convincing Mississippi governor Martin Sennet Conner to keep his state&#x27;s delegation loyal to Roosevelt, but Roosevelt preferred Barkley because of his support of the New Deal. A letter from Roosevelt praising Barkley&#x27;s legislative accomplishments and addressed to &quot;My Dear Alben&quot; was seen as an endorsement. Although Roosevelt remained publicly neutral, he pressured Illinois&#x27; William H. Dieterich and Missouri&#x27;s Harry S. Truman to support Barkley instead of Harrison; Dieterich acquiesced, but Truman remained loyal to Harrison. Many senators resented Roosevelt&#x27;s interference in a traditionally legislative prerogative. Ultimately, Barkley was elected by a single vote.

===Challenge by Happy Chandler===

Barkley faced a primary challenge in his 1938 re-election bid from Albert B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, Kentucky&#x27;s popular governor who had a strong political organization throughout the state. According to historian James C. Klotter, Chandler was confident of his ascension to the presidency and saw the Senate as a stepping stone. Chandler twice asked Roosevelt to appoint Kentucky&#x27;s junior Senator, M. M. Logan, to a federal judgeship so he could arrange his own appointment to Logan&#x27;s Senate seat. On one of these occasions – the retirement of Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland – Barkley advised Roosevelt to appoint Solicitor General Stanley Reed instead. Chandler&#x27;s mentor, Virginia senator Harry F. Byrd, and the bloc of Democrats who opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, then encouraged Chandler to announce his candidacy for Barkley&#x27;s seat.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; saw the primary as &quot;the Gettysburg of the party&#x27;s internecine strife&quot; over control of the Democratic National Convention in 1940. Early on, Chandler portrayed himself as a supporter of Roosevelt – since Roosevelt was popular in Kentucky – but opposed to the New Deal. He pointed to his fiscal conservatism as governor, including reorganizing and downsizing the executive branch and reducing the state&#x27;s debt. Polls showing Barkley with a comfortable lead and an overwhelming victory by New Deal supporter Claude Pepper in Florida&#x27;s May Senate primary convinced Chandler to shift his focus from the New Deal. He criticized Barkley as &quot;a stranger to the state&quot; and obliquely referred to &quot;fat, sleek senators who go to Europe and have forgotten the people of Kentucky except when they run for election&quot;. Forty years old – 20 years Barkley&#x27;s junior – he referred to Barkley as &quot;Old Alben&quot;.

Early in the contest, congressional business restricted Barkley&#x27;s campaign to weekends, so he enlisted allies like Fred Vinson to speak on his behalf. Chandler&#x27;s political enemies such as former governor Ruby Laffoon, whom Chandler had crossed as lieutenant governor, and John Y. Brown, who felt that Chandler had broken a promise to support him for a seat in the Senate, also supported Barkley. Although labor leaders had backed Chandler&#x27;s gubernatorial bid, they endorsed Barkley because of Roosevelt&#x27;s support for labor unions. After the congressional session, Barkley resumed his &quot;Iron Man&quot; campaign style, making between 8 and 15 speeches each day and traveling, on average, per week. This countered Chandler&#x27;s implication that Barkley&#x27;s age was a disadvantage, a charge that was further blunted when the younger Chandler fell ill in July, temporarily halting his campaigning. Chandler indirectly charged that a Barkley supporter had poisoned his ice water, causing the illness. Barkley ridiculed the suggestion, promising to appoint &quot;an ice water guard&quot; for his campaign. During speeches, he would lift a glass of water to his lips, then mockingly inspect it and refuse to drink it. Louisville police dismissed Chandler&#x27;s claim as &quot;a political bedtime story&quot;.

Recognizing that the defeat of his hand-picked floor leader would be a repudiation of his agenda, Roosevelt began a tour of the state in Covington on July 8. Chandler, the state&#x27;s chief executive, was invited to welcome the president. Although clearly campaigning for Barkley, Roosevelt made courteous remarks about Chandler in the spirit of party unity, but in Bowling Green, he chastised Chandler for &quot;dragging federal judgeships into a political campaign&quot;.

As nearly every 20th-century Kentucky governor had done, Chandler printed campaign materials with state funds, solicited campaign funds from state employees, and promised new government jobs in exchange for votes. A later investigation determined that Chandler had raised at least $10,000 from state employees. Federal New Deal employees countered by working on Barkley&#x27;s behalf. Barkley and George H. Goodman, director of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in Kentucky, denied that WPA employees played a role in the campaign, but journalist Thomas Lunsford Stokes concluded that &quot;the WPA ... was deep in politics&quot; in Kentucky, winning the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting for his investigation. A Senate committee investigated Stokes&#x27; findings, and WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed the committee&#x27;s report refuted all but two of Stokes&#x27; twenty-two charges. Nevertheless, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 which restricted federal employees&#x27; participation in political activities.

Barkley won the August 6 election by a vote of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky&#x27;s 120 counties, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler&#x27;s political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky&#x27;s history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley&#x27;s success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt&#x27;s image.

===Floor leadership===
With his caucus divided between conservatives and liberals, Barkley failed to secure passage for Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing plan. After the successive failures of several administration-backed domestic bills, the press dubbed the Senate Majority Leader &quot;bumbling Barkley&quot;. He was able to salvage an appropriations bill to cover overspending by the WPA, although it allocated much less funding than Roosevelt had wanted. He helped secure the Hatch Act, and &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; called a 1940 amendment that prohibited campaigning by federally funded state employees a &quot;monument to Alben Barkley&#x27;s persistence and parliamentary skill&quot;. Despite this mixed record, Roosevelt believed some Democratic partisans hoped to nominate Barkley for president at the 1940 Democratic National Convention, but the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, deepened his resolve to seek a third term.
Barkley disagreed with Roosevelt&#x27;s selection of Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace as his running mate; Libbey felt that &quot;there is enough evidence from Barkley&#x27;s tortuous private and public statements about the qualifications of Wallace to infer that Barkley wanted the vice presidency for himself&quot;, although he did not promote this idea to Roosevelt. Barkley was chosen permanent chairman of the convention; chants of &quot;We want Roosevelt&quot; interrupted his July 16 speech for 20 minutes, indicating that he had created a popular mandate for Roosevelt&#x27;s renomination, which occurred the next day. Roosevelt went on to win an unprecedented third term in a landslide.

Supporting Roosevelt&#x27;s provision of aid to Allied Powers during World War II, Barkley sponsored the Lend-Lease Act in the Senate. In November 1943, he helped draft the Connally–Fulbright Resolution for the creation of an international peace-keeping body at the end of the war, an idea he had favored since Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s support of the League of Nations. Supreme Court Justice and fellow Kentuckian Louis Brandeis influenced Barkley to adopt Zionism; during and after the war, Barkley advocated creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and introduced a 1943 resolution demanding that the Nazis be punished for persecuting Jews. U.S. entry into the war diverted Roosevelt&#x27;s attention away from domestic affairs. Vice President Wallace, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Democratic House Floor Leader John William McCormack, and Barkley – the president&#x27;s &quot;Big Four&quot; – helped develop and pass the administration&#x27;s legislative agenda. Barkley regularly met with the chairmen of the Senate&#x27;s standing committees, forming a sort of legislative cabinet. With their support, he secured passage of the War Powers Act and the Emergency Price Control Act. He also advocated passage of a measure to outlaw poll taxes, but the bill was defeated.

===Split with Roosevelt===
In April 1943 a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Barkley as &quot;a Democratic party &#x27;wheelhorse&#x27; who will pull the Administration wagon through thick and thin. Although he is the Majority Leader in the Senate, he is not an adroit negotiator, but a loyal supporter of the President come hell or high water.&quot;

Tension developed between Roosevelt and Barkley during the war, however. In 1943, Roosevelt refused to appoint Barkley to a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and Barkley criticized the War Production Board for awarding contracts for the production of war-related materials to large companies rather than small businesses. Their most notable clash occurred in February 1944 when Roosevelt requested that Congress approve tax increases to generate over $10 billion in revenue for the war. Barkley and the Senate Finance Committee negotiated a bill containing only $2.3 billion in tax increases. Feeling the measure was insufficient, Roosevelt convened the &quot;Big Four&quot; on February 21 and told them he would veto it. They urged him not to do so, assuring him the bill they had drafted was the best one they could pass. Roosevelt vetoed the bill the next day, marking the first time a U.S. president vetoed a revenue bill.

When Barkley entered the Senate chamber on February 23, word had spread that Roosevelt&#x27;s veto had angered him. He announced that he would resign as floor leader and encouraged his legislative colleagues to override the veto. He stated that Roosevelt&#x27;s characterization of the bill as &quot;providing relief not for the needy, but for the greedy&quot; was &quot;a calculated and deliberate assault upon the legislative integrity of every member of the Congress of the United States&quot;. Roosevelt sent a letter to Barkley insisting he had not intended to impugn Congress&#x27; integrity and urging him not to resign. The next morning, Barkley resigned and left the Democratic Conference Room; minutes later, the caucus unanimously re-elected him. Many members who had seen Barkley as Roosevelt&#x27;s advocate in Congress now looked upon him as Congress&#x27; advocate with Roosevelt. Subsequently, Congress overwhelmingly overrode the veto.

Barkley was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored replacing Vice President Henry Wallace on their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was too old. Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and chose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.

===Buchenwald concentration camp===
On April 11, 1945, U.S. forces liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp, established in 1937, where at least 56,545 people died. General Dwight D. Eisenhower left rotting corpses unburied so a visiting group of U.S. legislators could truly understand the horror of the atrocities. This group visited Buchenwald on April 24 to inspect the camp and learn firsthand about the enormity of the Nazi Final Solution and treatment of other prisoners.

The legislators included Barkley, Ed Izac, John M. Vorys, Dewey Short, C. Wayland Brooks, and Kenneth S. Wherry, along with General Omar Bradley and journalists Joseph Pulitzer, Norman Chandler, William I. Nichols, and Julius Ochs Adler.

===Truman succeeds Roosevelt===

Truman ascended to the presidency when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just before the end of World War II. In the war&#x27;s aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee&#x27;s report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading to the creation of the United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval of billions of dollars in loans to rebuild Europe. &quot;Look&quot; magazine named him the second most fascinating person in the country behind Eisenhower.

In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested control of both houses of Congress from the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression and gained control of the majority of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession, the Republican majorities – over Barkley&#x27;s objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.
Barkley&#x27;s wife became an invalid due to heart disease. Barkley had closed his law practice when he was elected to the Senate, so to pay for his wife&#x27;s care, he supplemented his $10,000 annual salary with speaking engagements. He was the Democratic Speakers Bureau&#x27;s most requested orator, surpassing Truman. A &quot;Pageant&quot; magazine poll of legislators chose Barkley and Republican Robert A. Taft as the hardest-working members of their respective parties. The Barkleys sold their Washington, D.C. home and moved into an apartment to reduce expenses. Marny Clifford, wife of Truman&#x27;s Naval Advisor Clark Clifford, nicknamed Barkley &quot;Sparkle Barkle&quot; for his care of his wife, who died March 10, 1947. When Barkley won the Collier Award in May 1948, he donated the $10,000 prize to the University of Louisville School of Medicine in his wife&#x27;s honor.

Civil rights bills, unpopular with Southern Democrats, were central to Truman&#x27;s Fair Deal. Because Barkley could still appeal to Southern Democrats, Truman asked him to be the keynote speaker at the 1948 Democratic National Convention for an unprecedented third time. Because of the Republican resurgence and Truman&#x27;s difficulty appealing to some Democrats, Republican nominee Thomas E. Dewey was expected to win the upcoming presidential election. Democrats were energized by Barkley&#x27;s keynote address, which promoted New Deal accomplishments and called the Republican-controlled 80th Congress a &quot;do nothing&quot; Congress. He mentioned Truman only once, leading Truman to suspect that Barkley sought to supplant him as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee, but no such attempt occurred. Despite these suspicions and his contention that a ticket consisting of a Missourian and a Kentuckian lacked regional geographic balance, convention delegates persuaded Truman to take Barkley as his running mate. Truman had wanted Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, but Douglas declined.

Barkley was disappointed that he was not Truman&#x27;s first choice as running mate, but over the next six weeks, he crisscrossed the country by plane, making over 250 campaign speeches in 36 states. Playing off Barkley&#x27;s keynote speech, Truman called a special congressional session on July 26, challenging Republicans to enact their agenda. They were unable to pass any significant legislation, seeming to confirm Barkley&#x27;s characterization of them as a &quot;do-nothing Congress&quot;.

==Vice presidency (1949–1953)==
In an upset victory, Truman and Barkley were elected over the Republican ticket by over 2 million votes, and Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress. Aged 71 years old at the time of his inauguration, he was (and still is) the oldest man ever elected vice president, breaking Charles Curtis&#x27; record at 69. His grandson, Stephen M. Truitt, suggested the nickname &quot;&quot; as an alternative to &quot;Mr. Vice President&quot;. The nickname was used by the press, but Barkley&#x27;s successor, Richard Nixon, discontinued using it, saying it belonged to Barkley.
Despite their personal differences, Truman and Barkley agreed on most issues. Because of Barkley&#x27;s legislative experience, Truman insisted his vice president attend cabinet meetings. Barkley chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and attended Truman&#x27;s weekly legislative conferences. When Congress created the National Security Council, it included the vice president as a member. Barkley acted as the administration&#x27;s primary spokesperson, making 40 major speeches in his first eight months in office. Truman commissioned the United States Army Institute of Heraldry to create a seal and flag for the vice president, advocated raising his salary, and increased his expense budget. Mark Hatfield&#x27;s biographical sketch of Barkley noted that he was &quot;the last [vice president] to preside regularly over the Senate, the last not to have an office in or near the White House, [and] the last to identify more with the legislative than the executive branch&quot;.

Despite the Democrats&#x27; advantage in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman&#x27;s agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve, hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas&#x27; favor. Georgia senator Richard Russell Jr. appealed Barkley&#x27;s decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.

On July 8, 1949, Barkley met Jane Rucker Hadley, a St. Louis widow approximately half his age, at a party thrown by Clark Clifford. After Hadley&#x27;s return to St. Louis, Barkley kept in touch with her via letters and plane trips. Their courtship received national attention, and on November 18, they married in the Singleton Memorial Chapel of St. John&#x27;s Methodist Church in St. Louis, the event televised nationally. Barkley is the only U.S. vice president to marry while in office.

Barkley&#x27;s most notable tie-breaking vote as vice president was cast on October 4, 1949, to save the Young–Russell Amendment that set a 90% parity on the price of cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and peanuts. His friends, Scott Lucas and Clinton Anderson, opposed the amendment, but Barkley had promised support during the 1948 campaign.

In 1949, Emory University chose Barkley to deliver its commencement address and awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws. The following year, the university&#x27;s debating society renamed itself the Barkley Forum. The university also created the Alben W. Barkley Distinguished Chair in its Department of Political Science.
Barkley tried to mentor Scott Lucas and Ernest McFarland, his immediate successors as floor leader, by teaching them to work with the vice president as he had during Truman&#x27;s vice presidency, but Truman&#x27;s unpopularity made cooperation between the executive branch and the legislature difficult. After the U.S. entered the Korean War, Truman focused on foreign affairs, leaving Barkley to campaign for Democratic candidates in the 1950 midterm elections. He traveled over and spoke in almost half of the states during the campaign. He felt ill when he arrived in Paducah on election day, and a doctor diagnosed him with a &quot;tired heart&quot;. Returning to Washington, D.C., he spent several days in the Bethesda Naval Hospital, but was able to preside when the Senate opened its session on November 28. Democrats lost seats in both houses but maintained majorities in each.

On March 1, 1951 – exactly 38 years from his first day in Congress – Barkley&#x27;s fellow congressmen presented him with the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his legislative service. Truman surprised Barkley, appearing on the Senate floor to present the medallion and a gavel made of timbers used to renovate the White House after the burning of Washington in 1814.

In November 1951, Barkley and his wife ate Thanksgiving dinner with U.S. troops at Kimpo Air Base in Seoul. On his 74th birthday, Barkley traveled to the front lines on a fact-finding mission for the president. On June 4, 1952, he cast another notable tie-breaking vote to save the Wage Stabilization Board.

===Campaign for president===
At the March 29, 1952 Jefferson–Jackson Day fundraiser, Truman announced that he would not seek re-election, although he was exempt from the Twenty-second Amendment&#x27;s term limits. After the announcement, the District of Columbia Democratic Club formed a Barkley for President Club with Iowa senator Guy Gillette as chairman. Prominent Kentuckians – including senator Earle C. Clements, governor Lawrence Wetherby, and lieutenant governor Emerson &quot;Doc&quot; Beauchamp – supported the candidacy. Exactly two months after Truman&#x27;s announcement, Barkley declared his availability to run for president while maintaining he was not actively seeking the office.
Barkley&#x27;s distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson of Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for the presidential nomination, but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell Jr. and Tennessee senator Estes Kefauver were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky&#x27;s delegation to the 1952 Democratic National Convention announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri&#x27;s delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson was not going to be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley&#x27;s advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.

To dispel concerns about his age (74), failing eyesight, and heart problems, Barkley arrived in Chicago for the convention and briskly walked seven blocks from the bus station to his campaign headquarters. The attempt was rendered moot on July 20 when a group of labor leaders, including United Automobile Workers president Walter Reuther, issued a statement calling Barkley too old and requesting that Democrats nominate someone younger like Stevenson. At a meeting with labor leaders the next morning, Barkley failed to persuade them to retract the statement, which caused delegations from large industrial states like Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to waver on their commitments to Barkley. On July 21, he announced his withdrawal from the race. Invited to make a farewell address on July 22, he received a 35-minute ovation when he took the podium and a 45-minute one at the speech&#x27;s end. In a show of respect, a Missouri delegate nominated Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack seconded it, but Stevenson was easily nominated. A month after the convention, Barkley hosted a Stevenson picnic and campaign rally at his home in Paducah and later introduced him at a rally in Louisville. Despite Barkley&#x27;s predictions of a Democratic victory, Stevenson lost in overwhelming fashion to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.

==Post-vice presidency (1953–1956)==
Barkley&#x27;s term as vice president ended on January 20, 1953. After the election, he had surgery to remove his cataracts. He contracted with NBC to create 26 fifteen-minute commentary broadcasts called &quot;Meet the Veep&quot;. Low ratings prompted NBC&#x27;s decision not to renew the series in September 1953. In retirement, Barkley remained a popular speaker and began working on his memoirs with journalist Sidney Shallett.

==Return to the Senate==
He re-entered politics in 1954, challenging incumbent Republican senator John Sherman Cooper. In a 1971 study of Barkley&#x27;s Senate career, historian Glenn Finch argued that Barkley was the only person who could beat Cooper. Few issues differentiated the candidates, and the campaign hinged on party politics; visits to Kentucky by President Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon, and Illinois senator Everett Dirksen on Cooper&#x27;s behalf reinforced this notion. Barkley resumed his Iron Man campaign style, campaigning for up to sixteen hours a day, countering the &quot;too old&quot; charge that had cost him the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination. He won the general election by a vote of 434,109 (54%) to 362,948 (46%), giving Democrats a one-vote advantage in the Senate.

Veteran West Virginia senator Harley M. Kilgore offered to exchange seats with Barkley, putting Barkley on the front row with the chamber&#x27;s senior members and himself on the back row with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer. In honor of his previous service, he was assigned to the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower&#x27;s appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence. Barkley did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto despite school segregation being legally required in Kentucky prior to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

=== Death ===
In a keynote address at the Washington and Lee Mock Convention on April 30, 1956, Barkley spoke of his willingness to sit with the other freshman senators in Congress; he ended with an allusion to Psalm 84:10, saying &quot;I&#x27;m glad to sit on the back row, for I would rather be a servant in the House of the Lord than to sit in the seats of the mighty,&quot; drawing riotous applause. He then collapsed onstage and died of a heart attack, aged 78. He was buried in Mount Kenton Cemetery near Paducah.

== Personal life ==

Barkley joined the Broadway Methodist Episcopal Church, where he was a lay preacher, and several fraternal organizations, including Woodmen of the World, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Improved Order of Red Men. On June 23, 1903, he married Dorothy Brower (November 14, 1882 – March 10, 1947). They had three children: David Murrell Barkley (1906–1983), Marion Frances Barkley (1909–1996), and Laura Louise Barkley (1911–1987). Laura Louise married Douglas MacArthur II, a U.S. diplomat and nephew of General Douglas MacArthur.

== Legacy ==
A dam constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the Cumberland River in 1966, and the lake it forms, were named Barkley Dam and Lake Barkley in Barkley&#x27;s honor. Barkley Regional Airport in Paducah is also named for him. In 1984, the federal government declined to purchase The Angles, his Paducah home, and it was sold at auction. Many personal items owned by Barkley are displayed on the second floor of the historic house Whitehaven in Paducah. In February 2008, Paducah&#x27;s American Justice School of Law changed owners after failing to secure accreditation from the American Bar Association. It was renamed the Alben W. Barkley School of Law, but remained unaccredited, and closed in December 2008.

<text>Kundalini yoga () is a spiritual practice in the yogic and tantric traditions of Hinduism, centered on awakening the kundalini energy. This energy, often symbolized as a serpent coiled at the root chakra at the base of the spine, is guided upward through the chakras until it reaches the crown chakra at the top of the head. This leads to the blissful state of samadhi, symbolizing the union of Shiva and Shakti. Most yoga schools use pranayama, meditation, and moral code observation to raise the kundalini.

In normative tantric systems, kundalini is considered to be dormant until it is activated (as by the practice of yoga) and channeled upward through the central channel in a process of spiritual perfection. Other schools, such as Kashmir Shaivism, teach that there are multiple kundalini energies in different parts of the body which are active and do not require awakening. Kundalini is believed by adherents to be power associated with the divine feminine, Shakti. Kundalini yoga as a school of yoga is influenced by Shaktism and Tantra schools of Hinduism. It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of mantra, tantra, yantra, yoga, laya, haṭha, meditation, or even spontaneously (sahaja).

== History ==
===Name===

The Sanskrit adjective &#x27; means &quot;circular, annular&quot;. It occurs as a noun for &quot;a snake&quot; (in the sense &quot;coiled&quot;, as in &quot;forming ringlets&quot;) in the 12th-century &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; chronicle (I.2). &#x27;, a noun which means &quot;bowl, water-pot&quot;, is found as the name of a Naga in &quot;Mahabharata&quot; 1.4828.
The Sanskrit feminine noun &quot;kuṇḍalī&quot; means &quot;ring, bracelet, coil (of a rope)&quot;, and is the name of a &quot;serpent-like&quot; Shakti in Tantrism as early as the 11th century, in the &quot;Śaradatilaka&quot;.

What has become known as &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; in the 20th century, after a technical term particular to this tradition, is actually a synthesis of Bhakti Yoga (devotion and chanting), Raja Yoga (meditation) and Shakti Yoga (the expression of power and energy).&quot; However, it may include haṭha yoga techniques (such as bandha, pranayama, and asana), Patañjali&#x27;s kriya yoga (consisting of self-discipline, self-study, devotion to God, dhyāna, and samādhi), tantric visualization and meditation techniques of &quot;laya yoga&quot; (known as &quot;samsketas&quot;).

Laya may mean either the techniques of yoga or (like Rāja yoga) its effect of &quot;absorption&quot; of the individual into the cosmic. Laya yoga, from the Sanskrit term &quot;laya&quot; (meaning &quot;dissolution&quot;, &quot;extinction&quot;, or &quot;absorption&quot;), is almost always described in the context of other Yogas such as in the &quot;Yoga-Tattva-Upanishad&quot;, the &quot;Varaha Upanishad&quot;, the exact distinctions between traditional yoga schools are often hazy due to a long history of syncretism, hence many of the oldest sources on Kundalini come through manuals of the tantric and haṭha traditions, including the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; describes the qualified yogi as practicing the four yogas&#x27; to achieve kundalini awakening, while lesser students may resort solely to one technique or another: &quot;Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga. Laya Yoga is the third. The fourth is Raja Yoga. It is free from duality.&quot;

===Hatha yoga===
The &quot;Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad&quot; is a syncretistic yoga text related to the schools of Hatha and Mantra yoga.

Other Sanskrit texts treat &quot;kundalini&quot; as a technical term in tantric yoga, such as the &quot;Ṣaṭ-cakra-nirūpana&quot; and the &quot;Pādukā-pañcaka&quot;. These were translated in 1919 by John Woodroffe as &quot;The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga&quot;. He identifies the process of involution and its techniques in these texts as a particular form of Tantrik &quot;Laya Yoga&quot;.

The &quot;Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad&quot; consists of three short chapters; it begins by stating that Chitta (consciousness) is controlled by Prana, and it is controlled by moderate food, postures and &quot;Shakti-Chala&quot; (I.1-2). Verses I.3-6 explain the concepts of moderate food and concept, and verse I.7 introduces &quot;Kundalini&quot; as the name of the &quot;Shakti&quot; under discussion:
:I.7. The Sakti (mentioned above) is only Kundalini. A wise man should take it up from its place (Viz., the navel, upwards) to the middle of the eyebrows. This is called Sakti-Chala. 
:I.8. In practising it, two things are necessary, Sarasvati-Chalana and the restraint of Prana (breath). Then through practice, Kundalini (which is spiral) becomes straightened.

==Modern forms==

=== Yogi Bhajan ===
In 1968, Harbhajan Singh Puri, also known as Yogi Bhajan, introduced his own brand of kundalini yoga into the United States, &quot;Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan&quot;. Yogi Bhajan founded the &quot;Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization&quot; (3HO) as a teaching organization. Former Kundalini teacher and scholar Philip Deslippe claims that Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of &#x27;Kundalini&#x27; yoga. &quot;When placed alongside the teachings of Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras (&quot;Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru&quot;) and chanting from the latter&quot;, Deslippe writes.

==Principles==

&quot;Kundalini&quot; is the term for &quot;a spiritual energy or life force located at the base of the spine&quot;, conceptualized as a coiled-up serpent. The practice of Kundalini yoga is supposed to arouse the sleeping Kundalini Shakti from its coiled base through the 6 chakras, and penetrate the 7th chakra, or crown. 
This energy is said to travel along the ida (left), pingala (right) and central, or sushumna nadi - the main channels of pranic energy in the body.

Kundalini energy is technically explained as being sparked during yogic breathing when prana and apana blends at the 3rd chakra (solar plexus) at which point it initially drops down to the 1st and 2nd chakras before traveling up to the spine to the higher centers of the brain to activate the &quot;golden cord&quot; - the connection between the pituitary and pineal glands - and penetrate the 7 chakras.
Borrowing and integrating many different approaches, Kundalini Yoga can be understood as a tri-fold approach of Bhakti yoga for devotion, Shakti yoga for power, and Raja yoga for mental power and control. Its purpose through the daily practice of kriyas and meditation in sadhana are described as a practical technology of human consciousness for humans to achieve their total creative potential. With the practice of Kundalini Yoga one is thought able to liberate oneself from one&#x27;s Karma and to realize one&#x27;s Dharma (Life Purpose). It is recommended to become free of desire or adopt vairagya before trying to arouse Kundalini. Additionally, having a guru is beneficial in Kundalini Yoga, because a guru can suggest the best method to awaken the Kundalini.

== Practice ==

The practice of kriyas and meditations in Kundalini Yoga are designed to raise complete body awareness to prepare the body, nervous system, and mind to handle the energy of Kundalini rising. The majority of the physical postures focus on navel activity, activity of the spine, and selective pressurization of body points and meridians. Breath work and the application of bandhas (3 yogic locks) aid to release, direct, and control the flow of Kundalini energy from the lower centers to the higher energetic centers.

Along with the many kriyas, meditations and practices of Kundalini Yoga, a simple breathing technique of alternate nostril breathing (left nostril, right nostril), are taught as a method to cleanse the &quot;nadis&quot;, or subtle channels and pathways, to help awaken Kundalini energy.

Sovatsky (1998) adapts a developmental and evolutionary perspective in his interpretation of Kundalini Yoga. That is, he interprets Kundalini Yoga as a catalyst for psycho-spiritual growth and bodily maturation. According to this interpretation of yoga, &quot;the body bows itself into greater maturation [...], none of which should be considered mere stretching exercises&quot;.

== Controversy ==

There have been accusations that modern Kundalini Yoga practice and related groups including 3HO and Ra Ma are cult-like in practices, financial abuse, and sexual abuse. Practices may include the use of crystals, wearing white, and restricted diets and are tied to medicine denial and encouraging practitioners to solve medical problems with costly retreats. &quot;Norton said students were told that any problem they had  — addiction, mental-health issues, procrastination — could be solved by investing more time and money into Ra Ma events and programming. [...] Jagat&#x27;s practitioners were told not to wear black because it shrinks their aura and not to wear rings on their middle fingers because it interferes with their connection to Saturn. A former student included footage of Jagat in a TikTok video in which Jagat appears to claim that COVID-19 lockdowns were linked to an &#x27;alien war&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Arsinoe III Philopator (, &quot;Arsinóē hē Philopátо̄r&quot;, meaning &quot;Arsinoe the father-loving&quot;, 246 or 245 BC – 204 BC) was Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt in 220 – 204 BC. She was a daughter of Ptolemy III and Berenice II and spouse of her brother Ptolemy IV, possibly co-ruler. She was the first Ptolemaic queen to bear her brother&#x27;s child.

==Life==
Between late October and early November 220 BC, she was married to her younger brother, Ptolemy IV. She took an active part in the government of the country, at least in the measure that it was tolerated by the all-powerful minister Sosibius.

In 217 BC, she accompanied Ptolemy IV along with 55,000 troops at the Battle of Raphia in Palestine against Antiochus the Great with 68,000 troops. Arsinoe may have commanded a section of the infantry phalanx. Both sides employed cavalry, elephants, and specialized troops such as archers, as well as traditional Macedonian phalanx. When the battle went poorly, she appeared before the troops and exhorted them to fight to defend their families. She also promised two minas of gold to each of them if they won the battle, which they did.

In summer, 204 BC, Ptolemy IV died. His two leading favorites, Agathocles and Sosibius, fearing that Arsinoe would secure the regency, had her murdered by Philammon in a palace coup before she heard of her husband&#x27;s death, thereby securing the regency for themselves.

==Issue==
* Ptolemy V

==Legacy==
Eratosthenes wrote a manuscript called the Arsinoe, which is lost, the subject being a memoir of the queen. It is quoted by many ancient scholars.

Portraits of her likeness are also rare, but do exist in the forms of a bust of marble, and another of bronze.

<doc id="92224" wikidata="Q40252" url="?curid=92224" title="Cleopatra I Syra">
<text>Cleopatra Thea Epiphanes Syra (; c. 204 – 176 BC), well known as Cleopatra I or Cleopatra Syra, was a princess of the Seleucid Empire, Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt by marriage to Ptolemy V of Egypt from 193 BC, and regent of Egypt during the minority of their son, Ptolemy VI, from her husband&#x27;s death in 180 BC until her own death in 176 BC. She is sometimes viewed as co-ruler to her husband and son, however evidence is conflicting.

==Life==
Cleopatra I was the daughter of Antiochus III the Great, King of the Seleucid Empire, and Queen Laodice III.

===Queen===
In 197 BC, Antiochus III had captured a number of cities in Asia Minor previously under the control of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. The Romans supported the Egyptian interests, when they negotiated with the Seleucid king in Lysimachia in 196 BC. In response, Antiochus III indicated his willingness to make peace with Ptolemy V and to have his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. They were betrothed in 195 BC and their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia. At that time Ptolemy V was about 16 years and Cleopatra I about 10 years old. Later on, Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemaic kings were to argue that Cleopatra I had received Coele-Syria as her dowry and, therefore, this territory again belonged to Egypt. It is not clear if this was the case. However, in practice, Coele-Syria remained a Seleucid possession after the Battle of Panium in 198 BC.

In Alexandria, Cleopatra I was referred to as &quot;the Syrian&quot;. As part of the Ptolemaic cult she was honoured with her husband as &quot;Theoi Epiphaneis&quot;. In line with ancient Egyptian tradition of sibling marriage, she was also named sister (, &quot;adelphḗ&quot;) of Ptolemy V. A synod of priests held at Memphis in 185 BC granted Cleopatra all the honours that had been given to Ptolemy V in 196 BC (inscribed on the bilingual Greek-Egyptian Rosetta Stone).

Cleopatra also held title of vizier as one of only two known Ptolemaic queens to did so (the first one being Berenice II of Egypt).

=== Queen Regent===
Ptolemy V died unexpectedly in September 180 BC, at the age of only 30. Cleopatra I&#x27;s son, Ptolemy VI, who was only six years old, was immediately crowned king, with Cleopatra as his regent. She was the first Ptolemaic queen to rule without her husband. In documents from this period, Cleopatra is named &quot;Thea Epiphanes&quot; and her name appears before Ptolemy. Coins were minted under the joint authority of her and her son.

Just before his death, Ptolemy V had been planning a new war against the Seleucid kingdom, but Cleopatra immediately ended the war preparations and pursued a peaceful policy, because of her own Seleucid roots and because a war would have threatened her hold on power. Cleopatra probably died in late 178 or early 177 BC, though some scholars place her death in late 176 BC.

On her deathbed, Cleopatra appointed Eulaeus and Lenaeus, two of her close associates as regents. Eulaeus, a eunuch, had been the Ptolemy&#x27;s tutor. Lenaeus was a Syrian slave who had probably come to Egypt as part of Cleopatra&#x27;s retinue when she got married. The pair were unable or unwilling to prevent the deterioration of relations with the Seleucid kingdom which culminated in the disastrous Sixth Syrian War.

==Issue==
Cleopatra and Ptolemy V had three children:

<doc id="92225" wikidata="Q39952" url="?curid=92225" title="Ptolemy VI Philometor">
<text>Ptolemy VI Philometor (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos Philomḗtōr&quot;; 186–145 BC) was a Greek king of Ptolemaic Egypt who reigned from 180 to 164 BC and from 163 to 145 BC. He is often considered the last ruler of ancient Egypt when that state was still a major power.

Ptolemy VI, the eldest son of King Ptolemy V and Queen Cleopatra I, came to the throne aged six when his father died in 180 BC. The kingdom was governed by regents: his mother until her death in 178 or 177 BC and then two of her associates, Eulaeus and Lenaeus, until 169 BC. From 170 BC, his sister-wife Cleopatra II and his younger brother Ptolemy VIII were co-rulers alongside him. Ptolemy VI&#x27;s reign was characterised by external conflict with the Seleucid Empire over Syria and by internal conflict with his younger brother for control of the Ptolemaic monarchy. In the Sixth Syrian War (170–168 BC), the Ptolemaic forces were utterly defeated and Egypt was twice invaded by Seleucid armies. A few years after the Seleucid conflict ended, Ptolemy VIII succeeded in expelling Ptolemy VI from Egypt in 164 BC.

The people of Alexandria turned against Ptolemy VIII and invited Ptolemy VI back to the throne in 163 BC. In this second reign Ptolemy VI was much more successful in his conflicts against the Seleucids and his brother. He banished his brother to Cyrenaica and repeatedly prevented him from using that as a springboard to taking Cyprus, despite substantial Roman intervention in Ptolemy VIII&#x27;s favour. By supporting a series of rival claimants for the Seleucid throne, Ptolemy VI helped instigate a civil war which would continue for generations and eventually consume the Seleucid dynasty. In 145 BC, Ptolemy VI invaded Seleucid Syria and won a total victory at the Battle of the Oenoparus, which left him in charge of both the Seleucid and Ptolemaic realms. However, injuries that he sustained in the battle led to his death three days later. The gains from the war were almost immediately lost and Ptolemy VIII returned to power.

==Background and early life==

Ptolemy VI was the eldest son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. The early reign of Ptolemy V was dominated by the Fifth Syrian War (204–198 BC) against the Seleucid king Antiochus III, who completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces, annexed Coele-Syria and Judaea to his empire, and reduced Egypt to a subordinate position. Under a peace treaty, Ptolemy V married Antiochus III&#x27;s daughter Cleopatra I in 194 BC.

Ptolemy VI was born in 186 BC, probably in May or June. He had two siblings: a sister, Cleopatra II, who was probably born between 186 and 184 BC, and a younger brother, Ptolemy VIII. His father advertised Ptolemy VI&#x27;s position as heir within Egypt and to the wider world, for example by entering a chariot team under his name in the Panathenaic Games of 182 BC. The defeat in the Fifth Syrian War cast a shadow over the rest of Ptolemy V&#x27;s reign. One prominent faction within the Ptolemaic court agitated for a return to war in order to restore Egyptian prestige, while another faction resisted the expense involved in rebuilding and remilitarising the realm. Ptolemy V died unexpectedly in September 180 BC, at the age of only 30. It is possible that he was murdered as a result of this factional infighting – a late source claims that he had been poisoned.

==First reign (180–164 BC)==
===Regencies===
Ptolemy VI, who was only six years old, was immediately crowned king, with his mother Cleopatra I as co-regent. In documents from this period, Cleopatra I is named before Ptolemy VI and coins were minted under the joint authority of her and her son. In the face of continued agitation for war with the Seleucids, Cleopatra I pursued a peaceful policy, because of her own Seleucid roots and because a war would have threatened her hold on power. She probably died in late 178 or early 177 BC, though some scholars place her death in late 176 BC.

Ptolemy VI was still too young to rule on his own. On her deathbed, Cleopatra I appointed Eulaeus and Lenaeus, two of her close associates, as regents. Eulaeus, a eunuch who had been Ptolemy VI&#x27;s tutor, was the more senior of the two, even minting coinage in his own name. Lenaeus was a Syrian slave who had probably come to Egypt as part of Cleopatra I&#x27;s retinue when she got married. He seems to have been specifically in charge of managing the kingdom&#x27;s finances.

Eulaeus and Lenaeus sought to reinforce their authority by augmenting the dignity of Ptolemy VI. In early 175 BC, they arranged his marriage to his sister Cleopatra II. Brother-sister marriage was traditional in the Ptolemaic dynasty and was probably adopted in imitation of earlier Egyptian Pharaohs. The couple were incorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult as the &quot;Theoi Philometores&quot; (&#x27;the Mother-loving Gods&#x27;), named in honour of the deceased Cleopatra I. In Egyptian religious contexts, the title recalled the relationship of the Pharaoh as Horus to his mother Isis. Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II were still young children, so the marriage was not consummated for many years; they would eventually have at least four children together.

===Sixth Syrian War (170 BC–168 BC)===
The Seleucid king Seleucus IV, Ptolemy VI&#x27;s uncle, had followed a generally peaceful policy, but he was murdered in 175 BC. After two months of conflict his brother Antiochus IV secured the throne. The unsettled situation empowered the warhawks in the Ptolemaic court, and Eulaeus and Lenaeus were unable or unwilling to resist them, with Cleopatra I no longer alive. By 172 BC, preparations for war were underway. Rome and Macedon commenced the Third Macedonian War in 171 BC, lessening their ability to interfere with Ptolemaic affairs, and the Egyptian government considered the moment for war had come.

In October 170 BC, Ptolemy VIII was promoted to the status of co-regent alongside his brother and sister. The current year was declared the first year of a new era. John Grainger argues that the two brothers had become the figureheads for separate factions at court and that these ceremonies were intended to promote unity within the court in the run-up to war. Shortly afterwards, Ptolemy VI, now around sixteen, was declared an adult and celebrated his coming-of-age ceremony (the &quot;anakleteria&quot;). He was now ostensibly ruling in his own right, although in practice Eulaeus and Lenaeus remained in charge of the government.
The Sixth Syrian War broke out shortly after this, probably in early 169 BC. The Ptolemaic army set out from the border fort of Pelusium to invade Palestine, but was intercepted and defeated by Antiochus IV&#x27;s army in the Sinai. Antiochus seized Pelusium and then pursued the Egyptians, who had withdrawn to the Nile Delta.

This defeat led to the collapse of the Ptolemaic government in Alexandria. Eulaeus attempted to send Ptolemy VI to the Aegean island of Samothrace with the Ptolemaic treasury. Before this could happen, two prominent Ptolemaic generals, Comanus and Cineas, launched a military coup and took control of the Egyptian government. As Antiochus IV advanced on Alexandria, Ptolemy VI went out to meet him. They negotiated an agreement of friendship, which in effect reduced Ptolemy VI to a Seleucid client. When news of the agreement reached Alexandria, the people of the city rioted. Comanus and Cineas rejected the agreement and Ptolemy VI&#x27;s authority, declaring Ptolemy VIII the sole king (Cleopatra II&#x27;s position remained unchanged). Antiochus IV responded by placing Alexandria under siege, but he was unable to take the city and withdrew from Egypt in September 169 BC, as winter approached, leaving Ptolemy VI as his puppet king in Memphis and retaining a garrison in Pelusium.

Within two months, Ptolemy VI had reconciled with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II and returned to Alexandria. The restored government repudiated the agreement that Ptolemy VI had made with Antiochus IV, and began to recruit new troops from Greece. In response, Antiochus IV invaded Egypt for a second time in the spring of 168 BC. Officially, this invasion was presented as an effort to restore Ptolemy VI&#x27;s position against his younger brother. Antiochus IV quickly occupied Memphis, where he was crowned king of Egypt, and advanced on Alexandria. However, the Ptolemies had appealed to Rome for help over the winter; a Roman embassy led by Gaius Popillius Laenas confronted Antiochus IV at the town of Eleusis and forced him to agree to a settlement, bringing the war to an end.

===Rebellions and expulsion (168–164 BC)===
The joint rule of the two brothers and Cleopatra II continued in the immediate aftermath of the war. However, the complete failure of the Egyptian forces had left the Ptolemaic monarchy&#x27;s prestige seriously diminished and caused a permanent rift between Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII.

In 165 BC, Dionysius Petosarapis, a prominent courtier who appears to have been of native Egyptian origin, attempted to exploit the conflict in order to take control of the government. He went to the stadium and announced to the people of Alexandria that Ptolemy VI was plotting to assassinate Ptolemy VIII. Ptolemy VI managed to convince his younger brother that the charges were untrue and the two kings appeared together in the stadium, defusing the crisis. Dionysius fled the city and convinced some military contingents to mutiny. Heavy fighting took place in the Fayyum over the next year. Another, apparently unrelated, rebellion broke out simultaneously in the Thebaid, the latest in a series of native Egyptian uprisings against Ptolemaic rule. Ptolemy VI successfully suppressed the rebellion after a bitter siege at Panopolis.

Owing to the preceding years of conflict, many farms had been abandoned, threatening the government&#x27;s agricultural revenue. In autumn 165 BC the Ptolemies issued a royal decree, &quot;On Agriculture&quot;, which attempted to force land back into cultivation. The measure was very unpopular and prompted widespread protests. A new branch of government, the Idios Logos (Special Account), was established to manage estates that had become royal property as a result of confiscation or abandonment.

Late in 164 BC, probably not long after Ptolemy VI had returned from the south, Ptolemy VIII, who was now about twenty years old, somehow expelled Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II from power – the exact course of events is not known. Ptolemy VI fled to Rome for help, traveling with only a eunuch and three servants. In Rome, he seems to have received nothing, and for accommodation had a poor room in an attic, offered by and shared with a painter of personal acquaintance. From there he moved on to Cyprus, which remained under his control.

==Second reign (163–145 BC)==
In summer 163 BC, the people of Alexandria rioted against Ptolemy VIII, expelling him in turn and recalling Ptolemy VI. The restored king decided to come to an agreement with his younger brother and granted him control of Cyrenaica. This may have been done at the instigation of a pair of Roman agents present in Alexandria at the time. Egypt fell under the joint rule of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II; they were mentioned together in all official documents. This system of co-rule, which would be the norm for most of the rest of the Ptolemaic dynasty, was inaugurated by an amnesty decree and a royal visit to Memphis to celebrate the Egyptian new year festival.

===Conflicts with Ptolemy VIII and the Seleucids===

Ptolemy VIII was not satisfied with Cyrenaica and went to Rome in late 163 or early 162 BC to request help. The Roman Senate agreed that the division was unfair, declaring that Ptolemy VIII ought to receive Cyprus as well. Titus Manlius Torquatus and Gnaeus Cornelius Merula were sent as envoys to force Ptolemy VI to concede this, but he procrastinated and obfuscated. On their return to Rome at the end of 162 BC, they convinced the Senate to abandon their alliance with Ptolemy VI and to grant Ptolemy VIII permission to use force to take control of Cyprus. The Senate offered him no actual support in this endeavour and Cyprus remained in Ptolemy VI&#x27;s hands.

In 162 BC, Ptolemy VI was also involved in a scheme to destabilise the Seleucid kingdom. His agents in Rome helped the king&#x27;s cousin Demetrius I escape from captivity and return to Syria to seize control of the Seleucid empire from the under-age king Antiochus V. Once Demetrius I was in power, however, their interests began to diverge and the prospect of war between the two kingdoms returned. In 158 or 154 BC, Ptolemy VI&#x27;s governor of Cyprus, Archias, attempted to sell the island to Demetrius I for 500 talents, but he was caught and hanged himself before this plot came to fruition.

In 154 BC, after surviving an assassination attempt which he blamed on his brother, Ptolemy VIII again appealed for assistance against Ptolemy VI to the Roman Senate. The Senate agreed to send a second embassy led by Gnaeus Cornelius Merula and Lucius Minucius Thermus, equipped with troops, in order to enforce the transfer of Cyprus to his control. In response, Ptolemy VI besieged his younger brother at Lapethus and captured him, with the help of the Cretan League. He persuaded Ptolemy VIII to withdraw from Cyprus, in exchange for continued possession of Cyrenaica, an annual payment of grain, and a promise of marriage to one of his infant daughters (probably Cleopatra Thea) once she came of age.

As a result of the conflict with his brother, Ptolemy VI made particular efforts to advance his eldest son Ptolemy Eupator as heir. The young prince was made priest of Alexander and the royal cult in 158 BC, when he was only eight years old. At age fourteen, in spring 152 BC, Ptolemy Eupator was promoted to full co-regent alongside his parents, but he died in autumn of the same year. This left the succession very uncertain, since Ptolemy VI&#x27;s remaining son was very young. He began advancing his daughter Cleopatra III, formally deifying her in 146 BC.

===Intervention in Syria (152–145 BC)===

A new claimant to the Seleucid throne, Alexander Balas, appeared in 153 BC. John Grainger proposes that Ptolemy VI provided Alexander with financial backing, naval transport, and secured Ptolemais Akko as a landing base for him. He argues that Alexander&#x27;s chancellor Ammonius should be seen as a Ptolemaic agent. There is however no explicit evidence for this, and Boris Chrubasik presents Alexander&#x27;s initial successes as accomplished without any Ptolemaic involvement, and challenges the identification of Ammonius as an Egyptian in particular. At any rate, an agreement between Ptolemy VI and Alexander was sealed in 150 BC, when Ptolemy VI married his teenage daughter Cleopatra Thea to Alexander in a ceremony at Ptolemais Akko.
By May 146 BC, however, Ptolemy VI was gathering troops. In 145 BC he invaded Syria while Alexander was putting down a rebellion in Cilicia. Alexander&#x27;s vassal Jonathan Maccabee allowed Ptolemy VI to pass through Judaea without interference. Ostensibly, Ptolemy VI acted in support of Alexander against the latest claimant of the Seleucid throne, Demetrius II. In practice, Ptolemy VI&#x27;s intervention came at a heavy cost; he took control of all the Seleucid cities along the coast, including Seleucia Pieria. He may also have started minting his own coinage in the Syrian cities.

While he was at Ptolemais Akko, however, Ptolemy VI switched sides. According to Josephus, he discovered a plot against his life by Alexander&#x27;s chancellor Ammonius. When Ptolemy VI demanded that Ammonius be punished, Alexander refused. Ptolemy VI remarried his daughter to Demetrius II and continued his march northward. The commanders of Antioch, Diodotus and Hierax, surrendered the city to Ptolemy and crowned him king of Asia. For a short period, documents referred to him as King of Egypt and Asia, and he initiated a double regnal count, with his Egyptian Year 36 = his Syrian Year 1. However, fearing that a unification of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms would lead to Roman intervention, Ptolemy VI decided to abandon the title. Instead, he limited himself to annexing Coele Syria and pledged to serve as a &quot;tutor in goodness and guide&quot; to Demetrius II.

Alexander returned from Cilicia with his army, but Ptolemy VI and Demetrius II defeated his forces at the Oenoparas river. Alexander then fled to Arabia, where he was killed. His severed head was brought to Ptolemy VI. For the first time since the death of Alexander the Great, Egypt and Syria were united. However, Ptolemy VI had been wounded in the battle and he died three days later. By late 145, Demetrius II had expelled all Ptolemaic troops from Syria and reasserted Seleucid control by leading his own forces all the way down to the Egyptian border. Ptolemy VI seems to have intended for his seven-year-old son, also named Ptolemy, to succeed him, but instead the Alexandrians invited Ptolemy VIII to assume the throne. Young Ptolemy was eventually eliminated by his uncle, apparently only after 143 BC, when he served as eponymous priest, and perhaps as late as 132/1 BC.

==Regime==
===Pharaonic ideology and Egyptian religion===

Like his predecessors, Ptolemy VI fully embraced his role as pharaoh and maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with the traditional Egyptian priesthood. In particular, he maintained close ties with the worship of Ptah and Apis at Memphis. Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II seem to have visited Memphis and stayed in the Serapeum there for the Egyptian New Year festival every year. During these visits, Ptolemy VI personally made the ritual temple offerings expected of the pharaoh.

In summer 161 BC, Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II gathered a synod of all the priests of Egypt in order to pass a decree granting tax relief and other benefactions to the priests in exchange for cultic honours in Egyptian temples – part of a series of decrees that had been issued under each of his predecessors, going back to Ptolemy III. The decree survives only on one fragmentary stele known as &quot;CG 22184&quot;. Other inscriptions record specific benefactions made at various points during the reign. In September 157 BC, Ptolemy VI affirmed the grant of all the tax revenue from the Dodecaschoenus region to the Temple of Isis at Philae, first made by his predecessor. The grant is recorded in the Dodecaschoenus decree. Around 145 BC, he granted the tribute from a Nubian leader to the priests of Mandulis at Philae.

===Relations with the Jews===
The Jewish historian Josephus emphasises Ptolemy VI&#x27;s personal interest in the Jews and their well-being. There had been a Jewish community in Egypt since at least the fifth century BC and it had grown significantly since the establishment of Ptolemaic control over Jerusalem in 311 BC. By Ptolemy VI&#x27;s reign, Jews had long been incorporated into the Ptolemaic army, and they enjoyed various privileges comparable to those possessed by Greeks and Macedonians in Egypt. A large group of new Jewish immigrants arrived in Egypt in the 160s BC, fleeing civil conflict with the Maccabees. This group was led by Onias IV, son of a former high priest who had been deposed by the Seleucids. Ptolemy VI permitted them to settle at Leontopolis, which became known as the Land of Onias, and to establish a temple with Onias as High Priest. The place is still known as Tell al-Jahudija (Hill of the Jews) today. Onias was also granted an important military position and his family became prominent members of the royal court. In Alexandria the Jews had their own quarter of the city with its own &quot;politeuma&quot; – a kind of self-governing community within the city, led by their own ethnarch. It is likely that this &quot;politeuma&quot; was established under Ptolemy VI.

===Relations with Nubia===

Until the reign of Ptolemy IV, the Ptolemies had controlled the region south of Aswan to the second cataract, which was known as the Triacontaschoenus or Lower Nubia and included rich gold mines. Throughout the 160s and 150s BC, Ptolemy VI reasserted Ptolemaic control over the northern part of Nubia. This achievement is heavily advertised at the Temple of Isis at Philae, which was granted the tax revenues of the Dodecaschoenus region in 157 BC. Decorations on the first pylon of the Temple of Isis at Philae emphasise the Ptolemaic claim to rule the whole of Nubia. The aforementioned inscription regarding the priests of Mandulis shows that some Nubian leaders at least were paying tribute to the Ptolemaic treasury in this period. In order to secure the region, the &quot;strategos&quot; of Upper Egypt, Boethus, founded two new cities, named Philometris and Cleopatra in honour of the royal couple.

<text>Cleopatra II Philometor Soteira (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Φιλομήτωρ Σώτειρα, &quot;Kleopatra Philomētōr Sōteira&quot;; c. 185 BC – 116/115 BC) was Queen consort of Ptolemaic Egypt from 175 to 170 BC as wife of Ptolemy VI Philometor, and then Queen regnant since 170 BC as co-ruler with her two successive brother-husbands, her daughter, and her grandson. 

She co-ruled during her first reign since 170 until 164 BC, with Ptolemy VI Philometor, her first husband and the older of her brothers, and Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, her younger brother. During her second reign she co-ruled again with Ptolemy VI from 163 BC until his death in 145 BC. She then ruled with her younger brother, Ptolemy VIII, whom she married, and her daughter Cleopatra III. She was sole ruler of Egypt from 131 BC to 127 BC. Her final reign from 124 BC to 116/5 BC was also spent in coregency with Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III.

She was the first Ptolemaic queen known for certain to rule in her own right, and thus first confirmed female Pharaoh of Egypt since Tausret&#x27;s reign during New Kingdom period.

==Life==
===Early life (before 175 BC)===
Cleopatra II was the daughter of Ptolemy V and likely Cleopatra I. If she was the daughter of Cleopatra I, she was a full sister of Ptolemy VI Philometor and Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Tryphon; otherwise she was their half-sister. She would eventually marry both of her brothers, in turn.

===Consort and first co-regency (175–131 BC)===
Following the death of their mother, Cleopatra I, in 177/6 BC, Cleopatra II was married to her brother Ptolemy VI Philometor in c. 175 BC, thus becoming Queen consort of Egypt, but she was declared formal co-regent with Ptolemy VI and their younger brother, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes Physcon, in 170 BC; trio continued to reign together until 164 BC. The year Cleopatra II&#x27;s reign began is considered by Sally-Ann Ashton to be 175 BC, the year of her marriage, but by Tara Sewell-Lasater to be 170 BC, when Ptolemy VIII also became co-ruler.

By becoming nominal co-ruler, Cleopatra II became first known Queen regnant of Ptolemaic dynasty. 

In 169–168 BC, the siblings&#x27; maternal uncle Antiochus IV of Syria invaded Egypt. Ptolemy VI Philometor briefly joined Antiochus IV outside Alexandria in 169 BC, then turned against him in alliance with his siblings. Antiochus IV was finally induced to give up his attempt to take over Egypt by Roman intervention. In 164 BC Cleopatra II and her husband were temporarily deposed by Ptolemy VIII, but were restored to power in 163 BC. After this, Ptolemy VIII was removed from the co-regency in Egypt and made king of Cyrene.

Ptolemy VI died on campaign in Syria in 145 BC. Cleopatra II agreed to marry her younger brother, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Physcon, who ascended the throne. According to Justin, Ptolemy VIII murdered Ptolemy, the surviving son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II, on his marriage to Cleopatra II, but new evidence shows he survived as a potential heir and served as eponymous priest of Alexander the Great in c. 143 BC; he was eliminated by his uncle sometime later. Cleopatra II bore Ptolemy VIII a new heir, Ptolemy Memphites, in c. 143 BC.

Between 142 BC and 139 BC Ptolemy VIII married Cleopatra&#x27;s younger daughter, his niece Cleopatra III. She quickly produced two sons, the future kings Ptolemy IX Soter and Ptolemy XI Alexander, and three daughters. These developments are assumed to have increased the pre-existing rivalry between Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VIII.

===Sole reign (132/1–127 BC)===
Cleopatra II led a rebellion against Ptolemy VIII in 132/1 BC, and drove him and Cleopatra III out of Alexandria at the end of 131 BC. At this time Ptolemy VIII is said to have had Ptolemy Memphites, his son by his older sister, Cleopatra II, dismembered and his head, hands and feet sent to Cleopatra II in Alexandria as a birthday present.

Cleopatra II ruled in Alexandria as sole ruler until 127 BC. Ptolemy VIII had retained the allegiance of parts of Egypt and gradually expanded his control from there. In 127 BC, he took over Alexandria, Cleopatra II being forced to flee to Syria, where she joined her daughter Cleopatra Thea and her son-in-law Demetrius II Nicator. The latter was unable to offer effective support to his mother-in-law, as Ptolemy VIII pitted against him a rival for the Seleucid throne.

===Second co-regency (124–116/5 BC)===
A public reconciliation of Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VIII was declared in 124 BC. After this she ruled jointly with her brother and daughter until June 116 BC when Ptolemy died. Among amnesty decrees seeking to heal the conflicts stirred by the recent civil war, Cleopatra II&#x27;s murdered son Ptolemy Memphites was deified as the God Neos Philopator in 118 BC.

Ptolemy VIII left the kingdom to be ruled by Cleopatra III and one of their sons. At the wishes of the Alexandrians, Cleopatra III chose Ptolemy Lathyros, her elder son, as her co-ruler. However, Cleopatra II retained seniority in the ruling triumvirate.

Cleopatra II disappeared from historical records sometime around October 116 BC. She is believed to have died in about 116 or 115 BC.

==Issue==
With Ptolemy VI she had at least four children, and possibly an additional daughter Berenice:
* Ptolemy Eupator, born in 166 BC. Became co-regent with his father for a short time, but died at a young age in c. 152 BC.
* Cleopatra Thea, born in c. 164 BC. She married Alexander Balas, Demetrius II Nicator and Antiochus VII Sidetes. Murdered by her son in c. 120 BC.
* Perhaps Berenice, born between 163 and 160 BC. Died young in c. 150 BC.
* Cleopatra III, born between 160 and 155 BC. Married to her uncle Ptolemy VIII.
* Ptolemy, born c. 152 BC. Murdered after 143 BC by Ptolemy VIII.

Ptolemy VIII and his older sister, Cleopatra II, are thought to have had at least one son, 
* Ptolemy Memphites, born between 144 and 142 BC. According to recent research, Ptolemy Memphites is identical to Ptolemy Neos Philopator, deified in 118 BC.

==Epithet==
*Cleopatra II was titled Philometor (&quot;Mother-loving [Goddess]&quot;) as spouse of her brother and co-ruler Ptolemy VI Philometor, in 175–164 and 163–145 BC.
*Cleopatra II was titled Euergetis (&quot;Benefactor [Goddess]&quot;) as spouse of her brother and co-ruler Ptolemy VIII Euergetes Physcon, in 145–132/1 and 124–116 BC.
*Cleopatra II was titled Philometor Soteira (&quot;Mother-loving Savior [Goddess]&quot;) during her sole reign in 132/1–127 BC and again as senior monarch in 116–116/5 BC.

<text>Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator (, &quot;Ptolemaĩos Néos Philopátōr&quot; &quot;Ptolemy the Father-loving [God]&quot;) was, ostensibly, a Ptolemaic king of Egypt. His identity and reign are controversial, and it is likely that he did not reign at all, but was only granted royal dignity posthumously. Depending on the historical reconstruction, he was a son of Cleopatra II of Egypt by either Ptolemy VI Philometor or Ptolemy VIII Physcon, with current scholarship leaning toward the second option.

==Identity==

The identity and role of the person usually designated Ptolemy Neos Philopator are unclear, and are based primarily on inferences from the succinct and possibly distorted information provided by Justin in his Epitome of the &quot;Philippic History&quot; of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus. Other relevant passages are found in Diodorus Siculus, Josephus, Livy, and Orosius.

Ptolemy, second son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II

According to what used to be the dominant reconstruction, Ptolemy Neos Philopator was the second son of the siblings Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra II of Egypt, who reigned briefly with his father in 145 BC, and for a short time after his father&#x27;s death, and was murdered by his uncle, Ptolemy VIII Physcon, when the latter married his mother Cleopatra II and became king of Egypt in 145 BC, as described by Justin. 

Reassessment

The identification described above had become traditional in scholarship for much of the 20th century, before being subjected to a fundamental challenge in a series of publications by Michel Chauveau. Chauveau demonstrated that, while a second son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II existed, born perhaps before 152 BC (when his older brother, Ptolemy Eupator, co-ruler in 152 BC, is described as their father&#x27;s &quot;eldest son&quot;), he was not associated on the throne with his father Ptolemy VI in 145 BC (the alleged evidence for that, a double dating of Year 36 = Year 1 in July-August 145 BC, is shown to reflect a brief parallel regnal count for Ptolemy VI as king in Syria), and did not become king on his father&#x27;s death later in 145 BC. Moreover, Chauveau demonstrated that the surviving son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II was not murdered on the return of Ptolemy VIII and his marriage to Cleopatra II in 145 BC, since he served as eponymous priest of Alexander and the dynastic cult in 143 BC. Chauveau concluded that this Ptolemy, never king or co-ruler, was likely eliminated at a slightly later point, perhaps in relation to the birth of his half-brother Ptolemy Memphites, son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II in August 143 BC or the marriage between Ptolemy VIII and his niece Cleopatra III in 141 BC. An alternative date for the elimination of the surviving son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II is during the civil war of 132-127 BC, when Cleopatra II expelled Ptolemy VIII from Alexandria and he, according to Justin, summoned his eldest son (assuming this was actually his stepson) from Cyrene to Cyprus, where he had him executed, lest the Alexandrians proclaimed him king. This reassessment of the evidence does not contradict the ancient sources, none of which explicitly states that the surviving son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II became king, but it corrects Justin&#x27;s assertion that he was eliminated on the occasion of his mother&#x27;s marriage to Ptolemy VIII (likely inspired by a similar narrative about the marriage of Ptolemy Ceraunus to Arsinoe II). 

Ptolemy Memphites, only son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II

The reassessment of the evidence about the second son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II has led to the alternative identification of Ptolemy Neos Philopator with Ptolemy Memphites, the son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II, who was born probably in August 143 BC, owing his by-name to his father&#x27;s installation as pharaoh at the traditional capital Memphis at about the same time. When Ptolemy VIII fled Alexandria in 132 BC, he took Ptolemy Memphites with him to Cyprus. According to Diodorus and Justin, here Ptolemy Memphites was murdered and dismembered on the orders of his father, who sent the remains of the boy to his mother Cleopatra II as a gruesome birthday gift. Subsequently, after the reconciliation between Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II in 124 BC, and in connection with the amnesty decrees of 118 BC, Ptolemy Memphites was integrated into the dynastic cult as Theos Neos Philopator (&quot;the New Father-loving God&quot;). Ptolemy Memphites, become Ptolemy Neos Philopator, was thus posthumously deified and added to the cult of the deified royals. But he had never been real king or co-ruler, except just possibly in absentia, if it really was the intention of his mother Cleopatra II of making him co-ruler. 

==Depictions==
There are two preserved depictions of Ptolemy Memphites, on the western and eastern exteriors of the Naos of the Temple of Horus at Edfu. In these two parallel scenes, the god Thoth is represented offering eternity to the enthroned Ptolemy VIII Euergetes Physcon, behind whom stand the diminutive figure of a son, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Cleopatra II, wearing a headdress with horns and tall plumes. The labels on the western exterior read: &quot;The living &quot;ka&quot; of the King, the image of Swajba, the divine seed of the Lord of the Country, the King&#x27;s Eldest Son, the King&#x27;s Beloved, Ptolemy, son of Ptolemy, may he live forever, the Beloved of Ptah.&quot; The labels on the eastern exterior read: &quot;Heir of the King, given birth by the Queen, who takes over from the Sole Lord, the King&#x27;s Eldest Son, the King&#x27;s Beloved, Ptolemy, son of Ptolemy, may he live forever, Beloved of Ptah, the God Euergetes.&quot; The heir, Ptolemy Memphites, is represented as king and his name is inscribed in a royal cartouche, although there is no attestation of any formal co-regency between him and his father. The epithet Euergetes is shared by all three royal figures, and is derived from the style of the senior king, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes Physcon. The reliefs representing Ptolemy Memphites are dated to 140 BC or a little earlier, long before his death and subsequent deification as Neos Philopator.

==Numbering==
The now &quot;traditional&quot; numbering of the Ptolemies is based on a combination of the order of names in the Ptolemaic dynastic cult and the older historical reconstruction disproved by Chauveau. The numbering generally excludes co-rulers who did not become sole or senior monarchs, like Ptolemy &quot;the Son&quot;, co-ruler, adopted son, and biological nephew of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and Ptolemy Eupator, co-ruler and son of Ptolemy VI Philometor. The notion that Ptolemy Neos Philopator was the surviving son of Ptolemy VI Philometor and reigned in 145 BC, combined with his listing in the dynastic cult (in order of death and deification, not reign) before Ptolemy Euergetes Physcon, led to the numbering Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator and Ptolemy VIII Euergetes Physcon. This is certainly erroneous, as Ptolemy Euergetes Physcon had already come to the throne as co-ruler in 170 BC and as sole ruler in 164-163 BC, long before any of his nephews or sons could have done so. However, to avoid a potentially confusing renumbering of all Ptolemaic kings subsequent to Ptolemy VI, although Ptolemy Euergetes Physcon ought to be counted as Ptolemy VII, he is generally still labeled Ptolemy VIII. Occasionally, the numbering is reversed, and Ptolemy VIII Physcon is numbered as Ptolemy VII, with the posthumously royal Ptolemy Neos Philopator (Memphites) numbered Ptolemy VIII, keeping subsequent regnal numbers unchanged. In some older works, Ptolemy Neos Philopator is omitted altogether; alternatively he is counted, as is Ptolemy Eupator. This results in the numbers 1 higher or 1 lower for the successors of Ptolemy VI. For these reasons, it is recommended that Ptolemaic kings be referenced alongside their epithets and nicknames, which provide less ambiguous identification.

<text>Seleucus III [[Soter]], called Seleucus Ceraunus (Greek: , &quot;Séleukos ho Sōtḗr ho Keraunós&quot;; c. 243 BC – April/June 223 BC, ruled December 225 – April/June 223 BC), was a ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom, the eldest son of Seleucus II Callinicus and Laodice II.

==Biography==
His birth name was Alexander and he was named after his great uncle the Seleucid official Alexander. Alexander changed his name to Seleucus after he succeeded his father as King. Seleucus&#x27;s rule was troubled &amp; unstable, during his tenure he unsuccessfully continued his father&#x27;s war in Asia Minor against Attalus I of Pergamon. Seleucus was seen as being energetic &amp; full of ambition like his father was. However he lacked character &amp; was usually very sickly, making him mostly unable to fulfil his ambitious ideas. He however, in the eyes of many did not suite his position. He was not very well liked by many as he did not fit their definition of a proper King, as much as he did try to prove the opposite. After a brief reign of less than two years (225–223 BC), he was assassinated in Anatolia by members of his army, possibly at the instigation of his powerful minister Hermeias. His official byname &quot;Soter&quot; means &quot;Saviour&quot;, while his nickname &quot;Ceraunus&quot; means &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;.

<text>Arthur Ernest Frahm (May 5, 1906 – February 12, 1981) was an American painter and commercial artist, best known for his campy paintings of pin-up girls in the 1950s. Frahm&#x27;s playful Americana style has been compared with that of Norman Rockwell.

==Biography==
Frahm was born in East Chicago, Indiana, in 1906. As a child, he was an avid drawer, and later took weekend classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. He subsequently joined the Chicago firm Ziprodt, designing window displays for merchants, before resigning to become a full time illustrator. For the rest of his career, Frahm ran his own studio as a freelancer. Beginning in the 1920s, he illustrated advertisements for a wide variety of companies, including Coca-Cola, Schlitz, Quaker Oats, and Libby&#x27;s. Frahm continued to paint during his service in the U.S. Army during World War II.

Frahm&#x27;s commercial peak was in the 1950s. Each installment of his &quot;ladies in distress&quot; pin-up series featured a woman whose underwear had fallen to her ankles in an everyday situation—such as carrying groceries, bowling, or changing a tire—much to the delight of male onlookers. Frahm&#x27;s publisher, Joseph C. Hoover and Sons, sold millions of calendars with the campy artwork, making it one of the most successful pinup series of the twentieth century.

In the 1960s, Frahm created two popular calendar series: one following a band of fun-loving hobos traveling from Miami to San Francisco, and another depicting policemen teaching safety measures to children. Later in his career, while continuing to do commercial work, Frahm&#x27;s tastes shifted to portraits and landscapes.

Frahm moved his family to North Carolina in 1954 before setting in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, where he died on February 12, 1981, aged 74. He was survived by his wife Ruth and daughter Diana.

<text>Antiochus VI Dionysus ( 148–142/1 BC), king of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom, was the son of Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea, daughter of Ptolemy VI of Egypt.

==Biography==
Antiochus VI did not actually rule. Either already in 145 or in early 144 BC he was nominated by the general Diodotus Tryphon as heir to the throne in opposition to Demetrius II, and remained the general&#x27;s tool. In c. 142/141 BC, the young king died. While some ancient authors make Diodotus Tryphon responsible for the death of the king, others write that he died during a surgery.

<doc id="92231" wikidata="Q6597183" url="?curid=92231" title="Armistice Day">
<text>Armistice Day, later known as [[Remembrance Day]] in the Commonwealth and [[Veterans Day]] in the United States, is commemorated every year on 11 November to mark the armistice signed between the Allies of World War I and Germany at Compiègne, France, at 5:45 am for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, which took effect at 11:00 am—the &quot;eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month&quot; of 1918—although, according to Thomas R. Gowenlock, an intelligence officer with the U.S. First Division, shelling from both sides continued for the rest of the day, ending only at nightfall. The armistice initially expired after a period of 36 days and had to be extended several times. A formal peace agreement was reached only when the Treaty of Versailles was signed the following year.

The date is a national holiday in France, and was declared a national holiday in many Allies of World War I nations, several of whom have since changed the name of the holiday from Armistice Day to either Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth of Nations, or Veterans Day in the United States. Italy celebrates the Armistice with Austria on November 4 as National Unity and Armed Forces Day. In Poland, November 11 coincides with National Independence Day.

== History in Allied countries ==
The first Armistice Day celebration was held at Buckingham Palace, commencing with King George V hosting a &quot;Banquet in Honour of the President of the French Republic&quot; (Raymond Poincaré) during the evening hours of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day events were subsequently held in the grounds of Buckingham Palace on the morning of 11 November 1919, which included a two-minute silence as a mark of respect for those who died in the war and those left behind.

Similar ceremonies developed in other countries during the inter-war period.
In South Africa, for example, the Memorable Order of Tin Hats had by the late 1920s developed a ceremony whereby the toast of &quot;Fallen Comrades&quot; was observed not only in silence but darkness, all except for the &quot;Light of Remembrance&quot;, with the ceremony ending with the Order&#x27;s anthem &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot;.

In Britain, beginning in 1939, the two-minute silence was moved to the Sunday nearest to 11 November in order not to interfere with wartime production should 11 November fall on a weekday. This became Remembrance Sunday.

Commemorations of November 11 were initially focused on honoring the military dead of the First World War and the return to peace. Just prior to or after World War II, many countries changed the name of the holiday, several changed the focus to include all veterans of their armed services, and a few honor their war dead both uniformed and civilian. Most member states of the Commonwealth of Nations followed the earlier example of Canada and adopted the name Remembrance Day. The United States in 1954 changed the name to All Veterans Day, later shortened to &#x27;Veterans Day&#x27;.

== 21st century ==
In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, Armistice Day is observed with a two minute silence (one minute in Australia) on the eleventh hour, with the main service taking place on Remembrance Sunday (also known as Remembrance Day). Both days are commemorated formally but are not public holidays. The National Service of Remembrance is held in London on Remembrance Sunday.

In the United States, Veterans Day honors American veterans, both living and deceased. The official day of national remembrance of those killed in action is Memorial Day, which predates World War I. Some, including American novelist Kurt Vonnegut and American Veteran For Peace Rory Fanning, have urged Americans to resume observation of 11 November as Armistice Day, a day to reflect on how we can achieve peace as it was originally observed.
In France, the holiday may also be known as Remembrance Day (&quot;Jour du Souvenir&quot;). In Belgium, it remains Armistice Day (&quot;Jour de l&#x27;Armistice&quot;).

The day has been a public holiday in Serbia since 2012. The Serbian forces suffered the largest casualty rate in World War I. To commemorate their victims, people in Serbia wear Natalie&#x27;s ramonda as a symbol of remembrance.

In Poland, 11 November is observed as National Independence Day, a public holiday to commemorate the anniversary of the restoration of Poland&#x27;s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic in 1918, after 123 years of partition by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Empire.

In Romania, Armistice Day is observed as Veterans&#x27; Day or Combat Theater Veterans Day, the day also signifies the death of the first Romanian soldier in the Afghanistan war on 11 November 2003. Since 2015, the Romanian peony is used to pay tribute to the Romanian soldiers who died on the battlefield.

Ceremonies are held in Kenya over the weekend two weeks after Armistice Day. This is because news of the armistice only reached today&#x27;s Zambia (the then Northern Rhodesia) about a fortnight later, where the German and British commanders then had to agree on the protocols for their own armistice ceremony.

On 11 November 2018, the centenary of the Armistice, commemorations were held globally. In France, more than 60 heads of state and government gathered at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

<doc id="92232" wikidata="Q297651" url="?curid=92232" title="Diodotus Tryphon">
<text>Diodotus Tryphon (, &quot;Diódotos Trýphōn&quot;), nicknamed &quot;The Magnificent&quot; () was a Greek king of the Seleucid Empire. Initially an official under King Alexander I Balas, he led a revolt against Alexander&#x27;s successor Demetrius II Nicator in 144 BC. He rapidly gained control of most of Syria and the Levant. At first, he acted as regent and tutor for Alexander&#x27;s infant son Antiochus VI Dionysus, but after the death of his charge in 142/141 BC, Diodotus declared himself king. He took the royal name Tryphon Autocrator () and distanced himself from the Seleucid dynasty. For a period between 139 and 138, he was the sole ruler of the Seleucid empire. However, in 138 BC Demetrius II&#x27;s brother Antiochus VII Sidetes invaded Syria and brought his rule to an end.

Diodotus Tryphon is unique in the history of the Seleucid empire as the only rebel from outside the dynasty to gain control of the whole kingdom. Other rebels had claimed the throne, such as Molon and Timarchus, but they never succeeded in bringing the whole realm under their control and both were defeated within a year of declaring themselves kings. By contrast, Tryphon held power for over seven years from his rebellion in 144 BC until his death in 138 BC.

==Life==
===Generalship and regency===
Diodotus was originally from , a dependent town of the city of Apamea. He served as a general for Alexander Balas, during the civil war which the latter fought with Demetrius II Nicator. In 145 BC, when Alexander&#x27;s father-in-law Ptolemy VI of Egypt switched his support to Demetrius II and invaded Syria, Diodotus and a man called Hierax were in command of the city of Antioch. They surrendered Antioch to Ptolemy and declared him king of the Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy, unwilling to rule both the Egyptian and Seleucid realms directly, declined the title in favour of Demetrius II.

;Revolt against Demetrius II

As Demetrius II secured himself on the throne, he began to eliminate former associates of Alexander Balas. Diodotus (Trypho) is introduced in the First Book of Maccabees as &quot;a certain Trypho [who] had formerly been one of Alexander’s supporters&quot;, who sees and seizes an opportunity when &quot;he saw that all the troops were grumbling against Demetrius [II]&quot;. He probably considered himself to be in danger, and he fled to an Arab ruler called Zabdiel or Imalkue, who had been entrusted with the care of Alexander Balas&#x27;s young son. Diodotus, with Arab support, declared Alexander&#x27;s son the new king, as Antiochus VI Dionysus. The new king was less than five years old and Diodotus held all actual power as his regent.

Diodotus and Antiochus were initially ignored by Demetrius who had to consolidate his power and was also faced with financial troubles. Utilising the discontent against the ruling regime Diodotus gathered a large army at his headquarters in Chalcis ad Belum. Eventually, Demetrius marched against them but he was defeated in battle, after which Diodotus gained control of Apamea and Antioch. Numismatic evidence indicates that Apamea was taken in early 144 and Antioch in late 144 or early 143.

Diodotus, in the name of the boy-king Antiochus VI, controlled most of Inland Syria, including Antioch, Apamea, Larisa and Chalcis. Demetrius on the other hand based himself in Seleucia Pieria and retained control of many of the Syrian and Phoenician coastal cities and Cilicia. Mesopotamia continued to recognise Demetrius as well and an invasion of the region by Diodotus in mid-144 seems to have been a failure. Territories further east, such as Susa and Elymais were conquered by the Parthians, who eventually took control of Mesopotamia as well in mid-141 BC.

;Intervention in Judaea
At the same time Diodotus made diplomatic overtures to the Jews under Jonathan Apphus in order to have them join with him against Demetrius, giving him honours and appointing his brother Simon Thassi as general. Jonathan accepted these overtures. Josephus justifies this by claiming that Demetrius had persecuted the Jews and that the memory of Alexander Balas encouraged them to support his son Antiochus VI. The situation did not last, however. The Jewish sources claim that the boldness of the Jonathan&#x27;s attacks on Demetrius&#x27; supporters led Diodotus to fear his power and begin to plot against him. In 142 BC, Diodotus dispatched troops who lured Jonathan to Ptolemais with a small guard and captured him. Although Simon Thassi paid the money that Diodotus had demanded as a ransom for his brother, Diodotus had him executed anyway and attempted to attack Jerusalem. Heavy snowfall forced him to abandon the siege and return to Syria. Simon quickly became a close ally of Demetrius II, who granted extensive freedoms to him - later seen as the moment when the Hasmonean Jewish state achieved full independence.

In the same year an army of Tryphon&#x27;s routed a pro-Demetrius force under Sarpedon between Ptolemais and Tyre, but as they were marching along the coast in pursuit, a great tidal wave wiped out the army, according to Athenaeus.

===Kingship===
In late 142 or early 141 BC, Antiochus VI Dionysus died, supposedly during a medical operation; most ancient sources accuse Diodotus of having had the young king murdered. Diodotus convinced the army to elect him king.

;Royal titles and representation
As king, Diodotus used the name Tryphon Autocrator. &#x27;Tryphon&#x27; referred to the Hellenistic royal virtue of &quot;tryphe&quot; (luxury). &quot;Tryphe&quot; was sometimes a negative attribute, implying softness, but could also be a positive virtue, advertising the ruler&#x27;s wealth and ability to reward his subjects. The epithet Autokrator is unique; it is not attested for any other Greek ruler from this period. Edwyn Bevan argued that this epithet was intended to recall the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander the Great, who had held the title of &quot;Strategos Autokrator&quot; as elected leaders of the Greek forces against Persia. In Bevan&#x27;s view this reference indicated Tryphon&#x27;s election as king by the &#x27;free Greco-Macedonian states of Syria&#x27;. Boris Chrubasik argues that Tryphon took the epithet in imitation of the Parthian rulers and to emphasise his independence from his predecessors (the term &quot;Autokrator&quot; literally means &#x27;ruling (by) himself&#x27;). The martial overtones of it perhaps served to counter the implications of softness that sometimes were associated with &quot;tryphe&quot;.
There is no sign that Tryphon considered himself to be part of the Seleucid dynasty. On the contrary, he emphasised the break with his Seleucid predecessors through his unusual title, as well as the iconography of his coinage. His coins depicts him in a mature guise, with a rather fat face and long flowing hair - emphasising the luxuriousness implied by the name Trypon. The reverse side of his coins depict an elaborately decorated Boeotian helmet. This might have been meant to extend his connection to the army, and/or to further emphasise the idea of martial luxury. The break with the Seleucids was also indicated by the abandonment of the Seleucid dating system, in which years were counted continuously from the rise to power of Seleucus I. Tryphon instituted a new system, counting from his own accession as king.

In order to secure Roman recognition of his kingship, Tryphon sent a golden statue of the goddess Nike to Rome. The Roman Senate chose to accept this Nike as a gift from Antiochus VI and did not extend recognition to Tryphon. There is no evidence that any of the neighbouring kings recognised Tryphon&#x27;s kingship either.

;War against Demetrius II and Antiochus VII
Once he was king, Tryphon expanded his control to at least Ptolemais-Akke and Dor. Demetrius, meanwhile, had journeyed east in 139/8 to fight the Parthians, who had seized control of Mesopotamia the previous year. He was defeated and captured by them July or August of 138 BC, leaving Tryphon as uncontested ruler of the remaining Seleucid territories.

Almost immediately, however, Demetrius&#x27; brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes took up the conflict against Tryphon. He declared himself King Antiochus Euergetes, left his home in Rhodes, and landed in Phoenicia in the face of staunch resistance. He married the wife of Demetrius, Cleopatra Thea, further legitimizing his position. Numismatic evidence shows that many coastal cities remained loyal to Tryphon, but that Sidon and Tyre immediately attached themselves to Antiochus&#x27; cause. Antiochus also successfully won over Simon Thassi by confirming and augmenting the grants made by his brother.
Antiochus defeated Tryphon in battle and took control of Antioch by the middle of 138 BC. He moved south to the fortress-city of Dor, where he was besieged. From there he escaped by sea to Orthosia and made his way to his home-region of Apamea, where he was besieged again. He died in late 138 or early 137 BC. Some sources say he was captured and executed, others that he committed suicide.

<text>An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of protein complexes and other molecules which transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions (both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously) and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. Many of the enzymes in the electron transport chain are embedded within the membrane.

The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain is an exergonic process. The energy from the redox reactions creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In aerobic respiration, the flow of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor. In anaerobic respiration, other electron acceptors are used, such as sulfate.

In an electron transport chain, the redox reactions are driven by the difference in the Gibbs free energy of reactants and products. The free energy released when a higher-energy electron donor and acceptor convert to lower-energy products, while electrons are transferred from a lower to a higher redox potential, is used by the complexes in the electron transport chain to create an electrochemical gradient of ions. It is this electrochemical gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP via coupling with oxidative phosphorylation with ATP synthase.

In eukaryotic organisms, the electron transport chain, and site of oxidative phosphorylation, is found on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released by reactions of oxygen and reduced compounds such as cytochrome &quot;c&quot; and (indirectly) NADH and FADH is used by the electron transport chain to pump protons into the intermembrane space, generating the electrochemical gradient over the inner mitochondrial membrane. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the electron transport chain is found on the thylakoid membrane. Here, light energy drives electron transport through a proton pump and the resulting proton gradient causes subsequent synthesis of ATP. In bacteria, the electron transport chain can vary between species but it always constitutes a set of redox reactions that are coupled to the synthesis of ATP through the generation of an electrochemical gradient and oxidative phosphorylation through ATP synthase.

==Mitochondrial electron transport chains==

Most eukaryotic cells have mitochondria, which produce ATP from reactions of oxygen with products of the citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. At the inner mitochondrial membrane, electrons from NADH and FADH pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen, which provides the energy driving the process as it is reduced to water. The electron transport chain comprises an enzymatic series of electron donors and acceptors. Each electron donor will pass electrons to an acceptor of higher redox potential, which in turn donates these electrons to another acceptor, a process that continues down the series until electrons are passed to oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor in the chain. Each reaction releases energy because a higher-energy donor and acceptor convert to lower-energy products. Via the transferred electrons, this energy is used to generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane by &quot;pumping&quot; protons into the intermembrane space, producing a state of higher free energy that has the potential to do work. This entire process is called oxidative phosphorylation since ADP is phosphorylated to ATP by using the electrochemical gradient that the redox reactions of the electron transport chain have established driven by energy-releasing reactions of oxygen.

===Mitochondrial redox carriers===
Energy associated with the transfer of electrons down the electron transport chain is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical proton gradient (ΔpH) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton gradient is largely but not exclusively responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). It allows ATP synthase to use the flow of H+ through the enzyme back into the matrix to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. Complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase; labeled I) accepts electrons from the Krebs cycle electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and passes them to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone; labeled Q), which also receives electrons from Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; labeled II). Q passes electrons to Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex; labeled III), which passes them to cytochrome &quot;c&quot; (cyt &quot;c&quot;). Cyt &quot;c&quot; passes electrons to Complex IV (cytochrome &quot;c&quot; oxidase; labeled IV).

Four membrane-bound complexes have been identified in mitochondria. Each is an extremely complex transmembrane structure that is embedded in the inner membrane. Three of them are proton pumps. The structures are electrically connected by lipid-soluble electron carriers and water-soluble electron carriers. The overall electron transport chain can be summarized as follows:

 NADH, H → Complex I → Q → Complex III → cytochrome &quot;c&quot; → Complex IV → HO
 Complex II
 Succinate

====Complex I====

In Complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, Type I NADH dehydrogenase, or mitochondrial complex I; ), two electrons are removed from NADH and transferred to a lipid-soluble carrier, ubiquinone (Q). The reduced product, ubiquinol (QH), freely diffuses within the membrane, and Complex I translocates four protons (H) across the membrane, thus producing a proton gradient. Complex I is one of the main sites at which premature electron leakage to oxygen occurs, thus being one of the main sites of production of superoxide.

The pathway of electrons is as follows:

NADH is oxidized to NAD, by reducing flavin mononucleotide to FMNH in one two-electron step. FMNH is then oxidized in two one-electron steps, through a semiquinone intermediate. Each electron thus transfers from the FMNH to an Fe–S cluster, from the Fe-S cluster to ubiquinone (Q). Transfer of the first electron results in the free-radical (semiquinone) form of Q, and transfer of the second electron reduces the semiquinone form to the ubiquinol form, QH. During this process, four protons are translocated from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. As the electrons move through the complex an electron current is produced along the 180 Angstrom width of the complex within the membrane. This current powers the active transport of four protons to the intermembrane space per two electrons from NADH.

====Complex II====
In Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase or succinate-CoQ reductase; ) additional electrons are delivered into the quinone pool (Q) originating from succinate and transferred (via flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)) to Q. Complex II consists of four protein subunits: succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA); succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron–sulfur subunit mitochondrial (SDHB); succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C (SDHC); and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D (SDHD). Other electron donors (e.g., fatty acids and glycerol 3-phosphate) also direct electrons into Q (via FAD). Complex II is a parallel electron transport pathway to Complex I, but unlike Complex I, no protons are transported to the intermembrane space in this pathway. Therefore, the pathway through Complex II contributes less energy to the overall electron transport chain process.

====Complex III====
In Complex III (cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; complex or CoQH-cytochrome &quot;c&quot; reductase; ), the Q-cycle contributes to the proton gradient by an asymmetric absorption/release of protons. Two electrons are removed from QH at the QO site and sequentially transferred to two molecules of cytochrome &quot;c&quot;, a water-soluble electron carrier located within the intermembrane space. The two other electrons sequentially pass across the protein to the Qi site where the quinone part of ubiquinone is reduced to quinol. A proton gradient is formed by one quinol (&lt;chem&gt;2H+2e-&lt;/chem&gt;) oxidations at the Qo site to form one quinone (&lt;chem&gt;2H+2e-&lt;/chem&gt;) at the Qi site. (In total, four protons are translocated: two protons reduce quinone to quinol and two protons are released from two ubiquinol molecules.)
: &lt;chem&gt; QH2 + 2&lt;/chem&gt;formula_1&lt;chem&gt;(Fe^{III}) + 2 H&lt;/chem&gt;formula_2&lt;chem&gt; -&gt; Q + 2&lt;/chem&gt;formula_1&lt;chem&gt;(Fe^{II}) + 4 H&lt;/chem&gt;formula_4

When electron transfer is reduced (by a high membrane potential or respiratory inhibitors such as antimycin A), Complex III may leak electrons to molecular oxygen, resulting in superoxide formation.

This complex is inhibited by dimercaprol (British Anti-Lewisite, BAL), naphthoquinone and antimycin.

====Complex IV====
In Complex IV (cytochrome &quot;c&quot; oxidase; ), sometimes called cytochrome AA3, four electrons are removed from four molecules of cytochrome &quot;c&quot; and transferred to molecular oxygen (O) and four protons, producing two molecules of water. The complex contains coordinated copper ions and several heme groups. At the same time, eight protons are removed from the mitochondrial matrix (although only four are translocated across the membrane), contributing to the proton gradient. The exact details of proton pumping in Complex IV are still under study. Cyanide is an inhibitor of Complex IV.

===Coupling with oxidative phosphorylation===

According to the chemiosmotic coupling hypothesis, proposed by Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Peter D. Mitchell, the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are coupled by a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The efflux of protons from the mitochondrial matrix creates an electrochemical gradient (proton gradient). This gradient is used by the FF ATP synthase complex to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. ATP synthase is sometimes described as &quot;Complex V&quot; of the electron transport chain. The F component of ATP synthase acts as an ion channel that provides for a proton flux back into the mitochondrial matrix. It is composed of a, b and c subunits. Protons in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria first enter the ATP synthase complex through an &quot;a&quot; subunit channel. Then protons move to the c subunits. The number of c subunits determines how many protons are required to make the F turn one full revolution. For example, in humans, there are 8 c subunits, thus 8 protons are required. After &quot;c&quot; subunits, protons finally enter the matrix through an &quot;a&quot; subunit channel that opens into the mitochondrial matrix. This reflux releases free energy produced during the generation of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers (NAD and Q) with energy provided by O. The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis, catalyzed by the F component of the complex.&lt;br&gt;Coupling with oxidative phosphorylation is a key step for ATP production. However, in specific cases, uncoupling the two processes may be biologically useful. The uncoupling protein, thermogenin—present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue—provides for an alternative flow of protons back to the inner mitochondrial matrix. Thyroxine is also a natural uncoupler. This alternative flow results in thermogenesis rather than ATP production.

=== Reverse electron flow ===
Reverse electron flow is the transfer of electrons through the electron transport chain through the reverse redox reactions. Usually requiring a significant amount of energy to be used, this can reduce the oxidized forms of electron donors. For example, NAD+ can be reduced to NADH by Complex I. There are several factors that have been shown to induce reverse electron flow. However, more work needs to be done to confirm this. One example is blockage of ATP synthase, resulting in a build-up of protons and therefore a higher proton-motive force, inducing reverse electron flow.

==Prokaryotic electron transport chains==

In eukaryotes, NADH is the most important electron donor. The associated electron transport chain is NADH → &quot;Complex I&quot; → Q → &quot;Complex III&quot; → cytochrome &quot;c&quot; → &quot;Complex IV&quot; → O where &quot;Complexes I, III&quot; and&quot; IV&quot; are proton pumps, while Q and cytochrome &quot;c&quot; are mobile electron carriers. The electron acceptor for this process is molecular oxygen.

In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) the situation is more complicated, because there are several different electron donors and several different electron acceptors. The generalized electron transport chain in bacteria is:

 Donor Donor Donor
 dehydrogenase → quinone → &quot;bc&quot; → cytochrome
 oxidase(reductase) oxidase(reductase)
 Acceptor Acceptor

Electrons can enter the chain at three levels: at the level of a dehydrogenase, at the level of the quinone pool, or at the level of a mobile cytochrome electron carrier. These levels correspond to successively more positive redox potentials, or to successively decreased potential differences relative to the terminal electron acceptor. In other words, they correspond to successively smaller Gibbs free energy changes for the overall redox reaction.

Individual bacteria use multiple electron transport chains, often simultaneously. Bacteria can use a number of different electron donors, a number of different dehydrogenases, a number of different oxidases and reductases, and a number of different electron acceptors. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; (when growing aerobically using glucose and oxygen as an energy source) uses two different NADH dehydrogenases and two different quinol oxidases, for a total of four different electron transport chains operating simultaneously.

A common feature of all electron transport chains is the presence of a proton pump to create an electrochemical gradient over a membrane. Bacterial electron transport chains may contain as many as three proton pumps, like mitochondria, or they may contain two or at least one.

=== Electron donors ===
In the current biosphere, the most common electron donors are organic molecules. Organisms that use organic molecules as an electron source are called &quot;organotrophs&quot;. Chemoorganotrophs (animals, fungi, protists) and &quot;photolithotrophs&quot; (plants and algae) constitute the vast majority of all familiar life forms.

Some prokaryotes can use inorganic matter as an electron source. Such an organism is called a &quot;(chemo)lithotroph&quot; (&quot;rock-eater&quot;). Inorganic electron donors include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrite, sulfur, sulfide, manganese oxide, and ferrous iron. Lithotrophs have been found growing in rock formations thousands of meters below the surface of Earth. Because of their volume of distribution, lithotrophs may actually outnumber organotrophs and phototrophs in our biosphere.

The use of inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen as an energy source is of particular interest in the study of evolution. This type of metabolism must logically have preceded the use of organic molecules and oxygen as an energy source.

==== Dehydrogenases: equivalents to complexes I and II ====
Bacteria can use several different electron donors. When organic matter is the electron source, the donor may be NADH or succinate, in which case electrons enter the electron transport chain via NADH dehydrogenase (similar to &quot;Complex I&quot; in mitochondria) or succinate dehydrogenase (similar to &quot;Complex II&quot;). Other dehydrogenases may be used to process different energy sources: formate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, H dehydrogenase (hydrogenase), electron transport chain. Some dehydrogenases are also proton pumps, while others funnel electrons into the quinone pool. Most dehydrogenases show induced expression in the bacterial cell in response to metabolic needs triggered by the environment in which the cells grow. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase in &quot;E. coli&quot;, the enzyme is used aerobically and in combination with other dehydrogenases. It is inducible and is expressed when the concentration of DL-lactate in the cell is high.

=== Quinone carriers ===
Quinones are mobile, lipid-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons (and protons) between large, relatively immobile macromolecular complexes embedded in the membrane. Bacteria use ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q, the same quinone that mitochondria use) and related quinones such as menaquinone (Vitamin K). Archaea in the genus &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; use caldariellaquinone. The use of different quinones is due to slight changes in redox potentials caused by changes in structure. The change in redox potentials of these quinones may be suited to changes in the electron acceptors or variations of redox potentials in bacterial complexes.

=== Proton pumps ===
A &quot;proton pump&quot; is any process that creates a proton gradient across a membrane. Protons can be physically moved across a membrane, as seen in mitochondrial &quot;Complexes I&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;. The same effect can be produced by moving electrons in the opposite direction. The result is the disappearance of a proton from the cytoplasm and the appearance of a proton in the periplasm. Mitochondrial &quot;Complex III&quot; is this second type of proton pump, which is mediated by a quinone (the Q cycle).

Some dehydrogenases are proton pumps, while others are not. Most oxidases and reductases are proton pumps, but some are not. Cytochrome &quot;bc1&quot; is a proton pump found in many, but not all, bacteria (not in &quot;E. coli&quot;). As the name implies, bacterial &quot;bc1&quot; is similar to mitochondrial &quot;bc1&quot; (&quot;Complex III&quot;).

=== Cytochrome electron carriers ===
Cytochromes are proteins that contain iron. They are found in two very different environments.

Some cytochromes are water-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons to and from large, immobile macromolecular structures imbedded in the membrane. The mobile cytochrome electron carrier in mitochondria is cytochrome &quot;c&quot;. Bacteria use a number of different mobile cytochrome electron carriers.

Other cytochromes are found within macromolecules such as &quot;Complex III&quot; and &quot;Complex IV&quot;. They also function as electron carriers, but in a very different, intramolecular, solid-state environment.

Electrons may enter an electron transport chain at the level of a mobile cytochrome or quinone carrier. For example, electrons from inorganic electron donors (nitrite, ferrous iron, electron transport chain) enter the electron transport chain at the cytochrome level. When electrons enter at a redox level greater than NADH, the electron transport chain must operate in reverse to produce this necessary, higher-energy molecule.

=== Electron acceptors and terminal oxidase/reductase ===

As there are a number of different electron donors (organic matter in organotrophs, inorganic matter in lithotrophs), there are a number of different electron acceptors, both organic and inorganic. As with other steps of the ETC, an enzyme is required to help with the process.

If oxygen is available, it is most often used as the terminal electron acceptor in aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes. An oxidase reduces the O to water while oxidizing something else. In mitochondria, the terminal membrane complex (&quot;Complex IV&quot;) is cytochrome oxidase, which oxidizes the cytochrome. Aerobic bacteria use a number of different terminal oxidases. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; (a facultative anaerobe) does not have a cytochrome oxidase or a &quot;bc1&quot; complex. Under aerobic conditions, it uses two different terminal quinol oxidases (both proton pumps) to reduce oxygen to water.

Bacterial terminal oxidases can be split into classes according to the molecules act as terminal electron acceptors. Class I oxidases are cytochrome oxidases and use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Class II oxidases are quinol oxidases and can use a variety of terminal electron acceptors. Both of these classes can be subdivided into categories based on what redox-active components they contain. E.g. Heme aa3 Class 1 terminal oxidases are much more efficient than Class 2 terminal oxidases.

Mostly in anaerobic environments different electron acceptors are used, including nitrate, nitrite, ferric iron, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and small organic molecules such as fumarate. When bacteria grow in anaerobic environments, the terminal electron acceptor is reduced by an enzyme called a reductase. &quot;E. coli&quot; can use fumarate reductase, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, DMSO reductase, or trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase, depending on the availability of these acceptors in the environment.

Most terminal oxidases and reductases are &quot;inducible&quot;. They are synthesized by the organism as needed, in response to specific environmental conditions.

==Photosynthetic==
In oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from an electron donor such as NADH to an acceptor such as O through an electron transport chain, releasing energy. In photophosphorylation, the energy of sunlight is used to create a high-energy electron donor which can subsequently reduce oxidized components and couple to ATP synthesis via proton translocation by the electron transport chain.

Photosynthetic electron transport chains, like the mitochondrial chain, can be considered as a special case of the bacterial systems. They use mobile, lipid-soluble quinone carriers (phylloquinone and plastoquinone) and mobile, water-soluble carriers (cytochromes). They also contain a proton pump. The proton pump in &quot;all&quot; photosynthetic chains resembles mitochondrial &quot;Complex III&quot;. The commonly-held theory of symbiogenesis proposes that both organelles descended from bacteria.

<text>In Maya mythology, Chriakan-Ixmucane was a creator goddess formed out of four earlier creator gods. She is one of the thirteen creator deities who helped construct humanity. Other Maya stories speak of another goddess with many of Chirakan-Ixmicane&#x27;s attributes, who is called Ixcuiname.

<text>Tepeu is a word of the Kʼicheʼ Maya language meaning &quot;sovereign&quot; (also &quot;one who conquers&quot; or &quot;one who is victorious&quot;). The title is associated with the god Qʼuqʼumatz of the Kʼicheʼ-Maya, one of the creation gods of the Popol Vuh; his whole name translating as &quot;Sovereign Plumed Serpent&quot;. The title has also been used by numerous Kʼicheʼ rulers such as Tepepul.

The word originated from the Nahuatl &quot;Tepeuh&quot;.

<text>Huracán (; ; , &quot;one legged&quot;), often referred to as &quot;U Kʼux Kaj&quot;, the &quot;Heart of Sky&quot;, is a Kʼicheʼ Maya god of wind, storm, fire and one of the creator deities who participated in all three attempts at creating humanity. He also caused the Great Flood after the second generation of humans angered the gods. He supposedly lived in the windy mists above the floodwaters and repeatedly invoked &quot;earth&quot; until land came up from the seas.

His name, understood as &#x27;One-Leg&#x27;, suggests god K of Postclassic and Classic Maya iconography, a deity of lightning with one human leg, and one leg shaped like a serpent. God K is commonly referred to as Bolon Tzacab or Kʼawiil and was a god associated with power, creation, and lightning. The name may ultimately derive from &quot;huracan&quot;, a Carib word, and the source of the words &quot;hurricane&quot; and &quot;orcan&quot; (European windstorm).

Related deities are Tohil in Kʼiche mythology, Bolon Tzacab in Yucatec mythology, Cocijo in Zapotec mythology, and Tezcatlipoca in Aztec mythology.

<doc id="92269" wikidata="Q58476" url="?curid=92269" title="Itzamna">
<text>Itzamná () is, in Maya mythology, an upper god and creator deity thought to reside in the sky. Itzamná is one of the most important gods in the Classic and Postclassic Maya pantheon. Although little is known about him, scattered references are present in early-colonial Spanish reports (&quot;relaciones&quot;) and dictionaries. Twentieth-century Lacandon lore includes tales about a creator god (Nohochakyum or Hachakyum) who may be a late successor to him. In the pre-Spanish period, Itzamná was often depicted in books and in ceramic scenes derived from them. Before the names of the Maya deities were deciphered, Itzamná was known as &quot;god D&quot;, and is still sometimes referred to as &quot;god D&quot; by archeologists.

==Name==

J. Eric S. Thompson originally interpreted the name Itzamná as &quot;lizard house&quot;, &quot;itzam&quot; being a Yucatecan word for iguana and &quot;na&quot; meaning &quot;house&quot;. However, Thompson&#x27;s translation has gradually been abandoned. While there is no consensus on the exact meaning of the name Itzamná, it may be significant that &quot;itz&quot; is a root denoting all sorts of secretions (such as dew, sap, and semen) and also sorcery. The otherwise unattested, agentive form &quot;itzam&quot; could thus mean &quot;asperser&quot; or &quot;sorcerer&quot;. Although one finds god D&#x27;s Classic name glyph commonly rendered as &quot;Itzamnaaj&quot;, this reading still awaits confirmation.

==Early colonial reports==
The early colonial sources variously connect, and sometimes identify, Itzamná with Hunab Ku (an invisible high god), Kinich Ahau (the sun deity), and Yaxcocahmut (a bird of omen). 

The most reliable source on Itzamná, Diego de Landa, mentions him several times in the framework of his description of the ritual year. In the month of Uo, a ritual aspersion of the books took place under invocation of Kinich Ahau Itzamná, &quot;the first priest&quot;. In the month of Zip, Itzamná was invoked as one of the gods of medicine, and in the month of Mac, he was venerated by the very old on a par with the Chaacs, the rain deities. In the cycle of four years, one year was under the patronage of Itzamná. 

Itzamná was an active creator god, as is shown by the following. Confirming Landa&#x27;s description of the book ritual above, (Hun-)Itzamná is stated by Diego López de Cogolludo to have invented the priestly art of writing. According to this same author, Itzamná (now written Zamna) had been a sort of priest who divided the land of Yucatán and assigned names to all of its features. More generally, Itzamná was the creator of humankind, and also the father of Bacab (Francisco Hernández), a fourfold deity of the interior of the Earth. In an alternative tradition, Itzamná begot thirteen sons with Ixchel, two of whom created the Earth and humankind (Las Casas).

==Pre-colonial era==
In the New Year pages of the Dresden Codex, Itzamna is given a role similar to that described by Landa. The version of Itzamna depicted in the codices is very similar to the much earlier depictions in Classic iconography. In comparison with the early-colonial descriptions, Classic scenes are more suggestive of narrative traditions, at times subjecting Itzamna to the actions of others: He can, for example, be shown clinging to the back of a peccary or a deer; held ready for sacrifice; or being shot at in his bird avatar.

===High priest and ruler===
Itzamna is sometimes dressed as a high priest, and hieroglyphically identified as the god of rulership. Speaking generally, Classic iconography confirms Itzamna&#x27;s identity as an upper god, seated on his celestial throne while governing, among other things, the affairs of agriculture and the hunt.

===Crust of the Earth: Caiman===

On two of the Dresden Codex&#x27;s very first pages, the head of Itzamna appears within the serpent maw of a two-headed caiman representing the Earth, and seemingly corresponding to the &quot;Itzam Cab Ain&quot; (Itzam Earth Caiman) of a creation myth in some of the Books of Chilam Balam; a case has been made for identifying this caiman as Itzamna&#x27;s transformation (Thompson, Taube).

===Father of Bacab===
Both Itzamna and his avian manifestation sometimes show features of the Bacab (god N), who, as mentioned above, appears to have been considered a son of Itzamna at the time of the Spanish conquest.

===Aged tonsured maize god===
Iconographically, Itzamna can be considered an aged form of the tonsured maize god. Both deities are often shown together.

===Principal Bird Deity===

From the Late Postclassic Paris Codex back in time to the Pre-Classic San Bartolo murals, Itzamna has the so-called Principal Bird Deity - perhaps the Yaxcocahmut mentioned above - for a transformative shape (see figure). The bird often holds a bicephalous (two-headed) snake in its beak. Its head sometimes resembles that of a rain deity; at other times, it is more like that of a bird of prey, perhaps the laughing falcon believed to be a harbinger of rain. The wings are repeatedly inscribed with the signs for &quot;daylight&quot; and &quot;night&quot;, suggesting that the bird&#x27;s flight could represent the unfolding of time. The San Bartolo murals have a Principal Bird Deity seated on top of each of four world trees, recalling the four world trees (together with a fifth, central tree) which, according to some of the early-colonial Chilam Balam books, were re-erected after the collapse of the sky. These world trees were associated with specific birds. Four world trees also appear in the Mexican Borgia Codex. The shooting of the Principal Bird deity is one of the main episodes of the Classic Period Hero Twins myth; but strong arguments plead against the Principal Bird Deity&#x27;s equation with Vucub Caquix, a bird demon shot by the Popol Vuh Twins.

===Human representatives===
Itzamna and his avian transformation could be represented by human beings. Various kings of Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, and Naranjo had Itzamnaaj as part of their names or titles. On Palenque&#x27;s Temple XIX platform, a dignitary presenting the king with his royal headband wears the Principal Bird Deity&#x27;s headdress, while being referred to as Itzamnaaj. In his bird avatar, god D here appears as the creator god bestowing rulership on a king.

<text>Bacab () is the generic Yucatec Maya name for the four prehispanic aged deities of the interior of the Earth and its water deposits. The Bacabs have more recent counterparts in the lecherous, drunken old thunder deities of the Gulf Coast regions. The Bacabs are also referred to as &quot;Pawahtuns&quot;.

==Yucatec traditions==
===Myth===
The Bacabs &quot;were four brothers whom God placed, when he created the world, at the four points of it, holding up the sky so that it should not fall. [...] They escaped when the world was destroyed by the deluge.&quot; Their names were Hobnil, Cantzicnal, Saccimi, and Hosanek. 

The Bacabs played an important role in the cosmological upheaval associated with Katun 11 Ahau, when Oxlahuntiku &#x27;Thirteen-god&#x27; was humbled by Bolontiku &#x27;Nine-god&#x27;. According to the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel, &quot;then the sky would fall, it would fall down, it would fall down upon the earth, when the four gods, the four Bacabs, were set up, who brought about the destruction of the world.&quot;

According to Francisco Hernández (quoted by Las Casas and Diego López de Cogolludo), the Bacab (apparently a unitary concept) was the son of the creator god, Itzamna, and of the goddess Ixchebelyax; he had once been humbled, killed, and revived. 

===Ritual===
The veneration of the Bacabs was closely connected to that of the so-called Year Bearers and their prognostics. Each Bacab ruled one of the directions and the associated Year Bearer day (one of four New Year days), as follows:
The Bacabs were invoked in connection with rain and agriculture, since they were intimately associated with the four Chaacs, or rain deities, and the Pawahtuns, or wind deities, all located in the four directions. The Maya of Chan Kom referred to the four skybearers as the four Chacs (Redfield and Villa Rojas).
Since they were Year Bearer patrons, and also because of their meteorological qualities, the Bacabs were important in divination ceremonies; they were approached with questions about crops, weather, or the health of bees (Landa). 

In addition, the &quot;Four Gods, Four Bacabs&quot; were often invoked in curing rituals that had the four-cornered world and its beaches for a theatre, which is the basic reason why the most important early-colonial collection of Yucatec curing texts, the &quot;Ritual of the Bacabs&quot;, has been named after them.

==Gulf Coast traditions==
Of the &#x27;Grandfathers&#x27; of the Gulf Coast corresponding to the Bacabs, the most powerful one is responsible for opening the rainy season. The four Earth-carrying old men are sometimes conceived as drowned ancestors who are serving for one year; then, other drowned men are substituted for them. Together with this comes the concept that the powerful &#x27;Grandfather&#x27; only grows old over the course of the year. 

==Earlier representations==
Iconographically, the Bacab corresponds to god N in the Schellhas-Zimmermann-Taube classification, an aged deity of thunder, mountains, and the interior of the earth (Taube 1992). Often represented fourfold, he can wear the attribute of a conch, a turtle, a snail, a spider web, or a bee &#x27;armour&#x27;. In the rain almanacs of the Post-Classic Dresden Codex, the old man with the conch and the turtle is put on a par with Chaac. The Bacabs who carry the sky are represented by forms of God N holding up the sky dragon. Moreover, standing between and separating earth and sky, God N is often identified with both the sky dragon and the earth dragon, thus giving structure to the universe.

In addition to the above, God N, or the Bacab, occurs in various stereotypical situations: 
*Fourfold, the Bacabs are repeatedly shown carrying the slab of a throne or the roof of a building. In this, young, princely impersonators can substitute for them (see fig.), a fact reminiscent of the drowned ancestors serving as earth-carriers mentioned above. On a damaged relief panel from Pomona, four of these young Bacab impersonators appear to have held the four Classic Year Bearer days in their hands.
*A Bacab inhabiting a turtle (perhaps representing the earth) is part of the scenes with the resurrection of the Maya maize god.
*Still unexplained is a recurring scene depicted on Chama vases, in which a young man holds a Bacab, half-hidden in his conch, by the wrist, apparently to sacrifice him with a knife.

The Bacab has a peculiar netted element as a distinguishing attribute serving as a headdress, which might conceivably belong to the sphere of the hunt or of beekeeping. It recurs as a superfix in his hieroglyphical names; its reading is uncertain. Hieroglyphically, one finds conflations of Itzamna (god D) and Bacab (god N), recalling the mythological filiation of the Bacab mentioned by Francisco Hernández.

<text>Hunab Ku (, standard Yucatec Mayan orthography: Junab K&#x27;uj) is a colonial period Yucatec Maya &quot;reducido&quot; term meaning &quot;The One God&quot;. It is used in colonial, and more particularly in doctrinal texts, to refer to the Christian God. Since the word is found frequently in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, a syncretistic document heavily influenced by Christianity, it refers specifically to the Christian God as a translation into Maya of the Christian concept of one God, used to enculturate the previously polytheist Maya to the new religion.

References to Hunab Ku have figured prominently in New Age Mayanism such as that of José Argüelles.

== Hunab Ku as the Christian God ==
The earliest known publicly available written reference to the term &quot;Hunab Ku&quot; (which translates as &quot;Sole God&quot; or &quot;Only God&quot;) appears in the 16th century &quot;Diccionario de Motul&quot;, where &quot;Hunab-ku&quot; is identified as &quot;the only living and true god, also the greatest of the gods of the people of Yucatan. He had no form because they said that he could not be represented as he was incorporeal&quot;. The term also appears in the &quot;Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&quot;, written after the Spanish Conquest, but is unknown in any pre-Conquest inscriptions in Maya writing. Hunab Ku was closely associated with an indigenous creator god, Itzamna, in an effort to make use of religious syncretism. An assertion that Hunab Ku was the high god of the Mayas can be found in Sylvanus Morley&#x27;s classic book &quot;The Ancient Maya&quot; (1946). It is necessary to refer to Mayan authors to verify the Mayan origin and use of this.

However, the interpretation of Hunab Ku as a pre-Hispanic deity is not widely accepted by Mayanist scholars today. Anthropological linguist William Hanks, for example, identifies &quot;hunab ku&quot; as an expression created in the context of &quot;maya reducido,&quot; a form of Yucatec created in the context of missionization. He writes &quot;The use of &quot;hunab ku&quot; [&#x27;one&#x27; + suffix + &#x27;god&#x27;] for the singularity of God is linguistically transparent to the oneness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and occurs widely in the missionary writings. He also notes, &quot;the fact that close paraphrases make reference to &quot;Dios,&quot; &quot;halal ku&quot;, and &quot;hunab ku&quot; allows us to securely identify &quot;hunab ku&quot; with the Christian God, even when surrounding text may be ambiguous.&quot;

== Hunab Ku in New Age Belief ==
New Age beliefs about Hunab Ku derive from the work of Me
r Domingo Martínez Parédez (1904–1984) who first presented his interpretation of the concept in 1953 and expanded upon his ideas in a subsequent book, &quot;Hunab Kú: Síntesis del pensamiento filosófico maya&quot; (1964). Martínez interpreted Hunab Ku as evidence for Maya monotheism and suggested that it was represented by the symbols of a square within a circle or a circle within a square, the square representing measurement and the circle representing motion. Martínez related Hunab Ku to concepts and symbols in Freemasonry, particularly the idea of a Great Architect of the Universe and the Masonic square and compass. It was also Martínez who first associated Hunab Ku with the expression &quot;&quot;In Lak&#x27;ech&quot;,&quot; which he translated as &quot;Eres mi otro yo.&quot; (In English, this means &quot;You are my other I.&quot;) Martínez&#x27; ideas were popularized by Hunbatz Men and José Argüelles. The significance of the symbol has also been discussed by José Castillo Torre

== Hunab Ku as symbol==

After being introduced to the concept by Hunbatz Men, who discussed this concept in his 1986 book &quot;Religión ciencia maya&quot;, Argüelles popularized Hunab Ku in his 1987 book &quot;The Mayan Factor&quot;. However, instead of Martínez&#x27; symbol, what Argüelles asserted was the &quot;Hunab Ku&quot; symbol was originally a rectangular design used by the Aztecs for a ritual cloak, known as the Mantle of Lip Plugs (or, arguably, mantle of &quot;spider water&quot;). The design survives today as a rug design being sold in central Mexico, but was associated with the Milky Way and the god Hunab Ku by Argüelles, who modified the symbol to look more like a circular motif evoking a yin and yang symbol as well as a spiral galaxy or the blood dropped by Hunab Ku on the bones that Quetzalcoatl took from Ah Puch to create humanity. It has become associated with Mayanism.

The earliest known appearance of the design is in the 16th century Codex Magliabechiano, an Aztec (not Maya) document that is also known for graphic depictions of heart sacrifice drawn by indigenous artists. The design was first reproduced by Zelia Nuttall, who rediscovered the Codex Magliabecchiano in Florence, Italy in 1898, in her 1901 book &quot;The Fundamental Principles of Old and New World Civilizations: A Comparative Research Based on a Study of the Ancient Mexican Religious, Sociological and Calendrical Systems.&quot; Facsimiles of the codex were published in 1903 and 1982. In 1976, the design was introduced to the weavers of Teotitlan, Oaxaca by epigrapher Gordon Whittaker, who commissioned a rug based on the design in the Codex Magliabbechiano. By 1978, it had been reproduced multiple times. Argüelles says he purchased two rugs from Teotitlan with the design, which he subsequently modified and popularized in his book &quot;The Mayan Factor&quot; (1987) and during the 1987 Harmonic Convergence.

The design, rendered in black-and-white, appeared on the cover and on decorated pages of &quot;The House of the Dawn&quot; (1914), a romance novel by Marah Ellis Ryan set in Hopi territory during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Decorative borders on pages in the book combine this design with the swastika, a motif that also appears frequently in other books by Ryan. It is likely that the illustrator for Ryan&#x27;s book found the Aztec design in Nuttall&#x27;s 1903 publication. John Major Jenkins, who first saw the symbol as used by Argüelles, subsequently encountered Ryan&#x27;s novel in a used book store. He appropriated the decorated borders for use in his zine &quot;Jaloj Kexoj and PHI-64: The Dual Principle Core Paradigm of Mayan Time Philosophy and its Conceptual Parallel in Old World Thought&quot; (1994) and also a version republished with modifications as the zine &quot;Aztec Sacred Science&quot; (1994).

Despite the assertions of Martínez, Argüelles, and Jenkins, there are no known representations of &quot;Hunab Ku&quot; that have been documented for the ancient Maya. It is an Aztec motif (see the commentary on the page for this article).

<text>Ixchel or Ix Chel is the 16th-century name of the aged jaguar goddess of midwifery and medicine in ancient Maya culture.

She corresponds to Toci, an Aztec earth goddess inhabiting the sweatbath. She is related to another Aztec goddess invoked at birth, &quot;viz.&quot; Cihuacoatl (or Ilamatecuhtli).

In Taube&#x27;s revised Schellhas-Zimmermann classification of codical deities, Ixchel corresponds to the Goddess O.

==Identification==
In the 1500s, Diego de Landa called Ixchel “the Goddess of making children”. He also mentioned her as the goddess of medicine, as shown by the following. In the month of Zip, the feast Ihcil Ixchel was celebrated by the physicians and shamans (&quot;hechiceros&quot;), and divination stones as well as medicine bundles containing little idols of &quot;the Goddess of medicine whom they called Ixchel&quot; were brought forward. In the Ritual of the Bacabs, Ixchel is once called &quot;grandmother&quot;. In their combination, the goddess&#x27;s two principal domains (birthing and healing) suggest an analogy with the aged Aztec goddess of midwifery, Toci.

Ixchel was already known to the Classical Maya. As Taube has demonstrated, she corresponds to Goddess O of the Dresden Codex, an aged woman with jaguar ears. A crucial piece of evidence in his argument is the so-called &quot;Birth Vase&quot;, a Classic Maya container showing a childbirth presided over by various old women, headed by an old jaguar Goddess, the codical Goddess O; all have weaving implements in their headdresses. On another Classic Maya vase, Goddess O is shown acting as a physician, further confirming her identity as Ixchel. The combination of Ixchel with several aged midwives on the Birth Vase recalls the Tzʼutujil assembly of midwife goddesses called the &quot;female lords&quot;, the most powerful of whom is described as being particularly fearsome.

==Meaning of the name==
The name Ixchel was in use in 16th-century Yucatán and amongst the Poqom in the Baja Verapaz. Its meaning is not certain. Assuming that the name originated in Yucatán, &quot;chel&quot; could mean &quot;rainbow&quot;. Her glyphic names in the (Post-Classic) codices have two basic forms, one a prefix with the primary meaning of &quot;red&quot; (&quot;chak&quot;) followed by a portrait glyph (&quot;pictogram&quot;), the other one logosyllabic. Ix Chel&#x27;s Classic name glyph remains to be identified. It is quite possible that several names were in use to refer to the goddess, and these need not necessarily have included her late Yucatec and Poqom name. Her codical name is now generally rendered as &quot;Chak Chel&quot;.

==Confusion with the moon goddess==
In the past, it was common to take Ix Chel as the Yucatec name of the moon goddess because of a shared association with human fertility and procreation. The identification is questionable, however, since (1) colonial and ethnographical sources provide no direct evidence to show that Ixchel was a moon goddess and (2) the Classic Maya moon goddess, identifiable through her crescent, is invariably represented as a fertile young woman. Moreover, fertility and procreation are as important to an aged midwife as to a young mother, albeit in different ways.

==Ixchel as an earth and a war goddess==
An entwined serpent serves as Ixchel&#x27;s headdress, crossed bones may adorn her skirt, and instead of human hands and feet, she sometimes has claws. Very similar features are found with Aztec earth goddesses, of whom Tlaltecuhtli, Toci, and Cihuacoatl were invoked by the midwives. Being a jaguar goddess, the Classic Ixchel (or &#x27;Chak Chel&#x27;) could equally be imagined as a fearsome female warrior equipped with shield and spear, not unlike Cihuacoatl in the latter&#x27;s capacity of &quot;Yaocihuatl&quot; (&#x27;Warrior Woman&#x27;).

==Ixchel as a rain goddess==
The Madrid Codex (30b) assimilates Goddess O to a rain deity, with rain pouring from her arm-pits and abdomen, while the Dresden Codex includes her in almanacs dedicated to the rain deities (Chaacs) and typically has her invert a water jar. On page 74 of the same codex, her emptying of the water jar replicates the vomiting of water by a celestial dragon. Although this scene has usually been understood as the Flood bringing about the end of the world, it is now thought to symbolize periodic rain storms and floodings as predicted on the basis of the preceding ‘rain tables’.

==Mythology==
Ixchel figures in a Verapaz myth related by Las Casas, according to which she, together with her spouse, Itzamna, had thirteen sons, two of whom created heaven and earth and all that belongs to it. No other myth figuring Ixchel has been preserved. However, her mythology may once have focused on the sweatbath, the place where Maya mothers were to go before and after birthgiving. As stated above, the Aztec counterpart to Ixchel as a patron of midwifery, Toci, was also the Goddess of the sweatbath. In myths from Oaxaca, the aged adoptive mother of the Sun and Moon siblings is finally imprisoned in a sweatbath to become its patron deity. Several Maya myths have aged goddesses end up in the same place, in particular the Cakchiquel and Tzʼutujil grandmother of Sun and Moon, called &quot;Bʼatzbʼal&quot; (&quot;Weaving Implement&quot;) in Tzʼutujil. On the other hand, in Qʼeqchiʼ Sun and Moon myth, an aged Maya goddess (Xkitza) who would otherwise appear to correspond closely to the Oaxacan Old Adoptive Mother, does not appear to be connected to the sweatbath.

==Cult of Ixchel==
In the early 16th century, Maya women seeking to ensure a fruitful marriage would travel to the sanctuary of Ix Chel on the island of Cozumel, the most important place of pilgrimage after Chichen Itza, off the east coast of the Yucatán peninsula. There, a priest hidden in a large statue would give oracles. To the north of Cozumel is a much smaller island baptized by its Spanish discoverer, Hernández de Córdoba, the &quot;Island of Women&quot; (Isla Mujeres), &quot;on account of the idols representing the Goddesses of the country which he found there, such as Ixchel, Ix Chekel Yax, Ixhunie, Ixhunieta. They were clothed from the waist down and had their breasts covered, as is the custom of Indian women.&quot; On the other side of the peninsula, the head town of the Chontal province of Acalan (Itzamkanac) venerated Ixchel as one its main deities. One of Acalan&#x27;s coastal settlements was called Tixchel &quot;At the place of Ixchel&quot;. The Spanish conqueror, Hernán Cortés, tells us about another place in Acalan where unmarried young women were sacrificed to a goddess in whom &quot;they had much faith and hope&quot;, possibly again Ixchel.

<text>In Maya mythology, Voltan was an earth and drum god (originally a human hero who was deified), married to Ixchel. 

The Maya believed in many different gods. These gods played a heavy role in the life of the Maya. They all had different roles. Some controlled the weather, the harvest, they dictated one&#x27;s mate, they gathered at every birth, they were in attendance at one&#x27;s death, and many more. Many of the things that the Maya did was a sign of respect for their gods; dress, architecture, etc.

<text>Gladstone Publishing was an American company that published Disney comics from 1986 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1998. The company had its origins as a subsidiary of Another Rainbow Publishing, a company formed by Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran to publish the Carl Barks Library and produce limited edition lithographs of Carl Barks oil paintings of the Disney ducks. The name references Gladstone Gander.

Reprints of classic Donald Duck stories by Carl Barks and Mickey Mouse stories by Floyd Gottfredson were the foundation of their output. Don Rosa, William Van Horn, and Pat Block are among the modern Disney comics artists who got their start at Gladstone. Some of the Van Horn stories had scripts by frequent collaborator John Lustig. The company also published translations of European Disney comic book stories produced by Egmont, Oberon and Mondadori. These included stories by such famed creators as Romano Scarpa, Marco Rota, Daan Jippes and Freddy Milton.

While still distributed on news stands, their orientation toward the collectors market was visible in their inclusion of scholarly articles, mostly by associate editor Geoffrey Blum. Unlike the previous Disney comic book licensee Western Publishing, Gladstone provided credits for the stories.

Although Gladstone is no longer an active publisher, it continues to offer its back issues through its website.

== First generation (1986–1990) ==

* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;
* &quot;Donald Duck&quot;
* &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot;
* &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;
* &quot;Mickey and Donald&quot;
* &quot;DuckTales&quot;

== Second generation (1993–1998) ==
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;
* &quot;Donald and Mickey&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot;
* &quot;Donald Duck&quot;
* &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;
* &quot;Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse&quot;
* &quot;Walt Disney Giant&quot;
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories Penny Pincher&quot;
* &quot;Uncle Scrooge and Donald Duck&quot;
* &quot;The Adventurous Uncle Scrooge McDuck&quot;

During the second run, there was another implosion in 1998, like the one that Disney Comics had back in 1991. This time, only two comics did not get cancelled – &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; – both of which converted to prestige format.

==Softcover albums==
During the first run Gladstone issued 28 albums and seven giant albums consisting mostly of reprints of stories by Carl Barks and Floyd Gottfredson. In 1990 Gladstone was licensed to publish a series of albums reprinting nearly all the Disney duck stories of Carl Barks. These were known as &quot;The Carl Barks Library in Color&quot; consisting of:
* Walt Disney Comics and Stories – Comic Albums #1–51 (With trading cards)
* Uncle Scrooge Adventures – Comic Albums #1–56 (With trading cards)
* Donald Duck Adventures – Comic Albums #1–25 (With trading cards)
* Gyro Gearloose – Comic Albums #1–6
* Uncle Scrooge – One-Pagers – Comic Albums #1 &amp; 2
* Donald Duck 1940s Christmas Giveaways

There were also three different series of Albums featuring stories by Don Rosa and William Van Horn respectively.
* The Don Rosa Library of Uncle Scrooge Adventures in Color #s 1–4 featured The first twelve chapters of The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck
* The Don Rosa Library of Uncle Scrooge Adventures in Color #s 5–8 featured all the Uncle Scrooge stories that Don Rosa did during his first two years as a Disney Comics Artist.
* The William Van Horn Library of Uncle Scrooge Adventures in Color #s 1–4 featured all of the stories that William Van Horn did during Gladstone&#x27;s first run.

After its license expired in 1998, Gladstone ceased publishing new material, and there were no more Disney comics in the United States (except for occasional graphic novels based on the Disney films, put out by Dark Horse Comics), until 2003, when Gemstone Publishing gained the publishing rights.

==EC Comics reprints==
Between 1990 and 1991, Gladstone reprinted four EC Comics titles, in association with EC-fan and publisher Russ Cochran. (Two different EC titles per issue). These included six issues of &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (August 1990 – June 1991), six issues of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (July 1990 – May 1991), four issues of &quot;Weird Science&quot; (September 1990 – March 1991), and two issues of &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; (May/July 1991). After four issues of &quot;Weird Science&quot;, Gladstone changed it to &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;. This took &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; from &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; and replaced it with &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;. &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot; took &quot;Weird Science&quot; as its second issue per comic. &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; kept &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot; for its double sized horror.

Subsequently, Cochran and the EC reprints moved to Diamond Comics-CEO Steven A Geppi&#x27;s Gemstone Publishers, which naturally reprinted the Gladstone-printed issues as part of their EC reprints. (Gemstone, whose key editorial staff at startup – John Clark, Gary Leach and Susan Daigle-Leach – previously worked for Gladstone, also subsequently gained the rights to Disney comics, a license formerly held by Gladstone.)

<doc id="92289" wikidata="Q93187" url="?curid=92289" title="Hilary Swank">
<text>Hilary Ann Swank (born July 30, 1974) is an American actress and film producer. She first became known in 1992 for her role on the television series &quot;Camp Wilder&quot; and made her film debut with a minor role in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1992). She then had her breakthrough for starring as Julie Pierce in &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994), the fourth installment of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; franchise, and as Carly Reynolds on the eighth season of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1997–98).

Swank came to international recognition for her performances as Brandon Teena in Kimberly Peirce&#x27;s &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999) and as Maggie Fitzgerald in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; (2004). Both performances earned her widespread critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards for Best Actress and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005.

Swank later ventured into producing with the films &quot;Amelia&quot; (2009), &quot;Conviction&quot; (2010), &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; (2014), and &quot;What They Had&quot; (2018), in all of which she also starred. Her other notable films include the television film &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; (2004) and the feature films &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; (2006), &quot;Freedom Writers&quot; (2007), &quot;The Resident&quot; (2011), &quot;The Homesman&quot; (2014), &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; (2017), &quot;The Hunt&quot; (2020), and &quot;Fatale&quot; (2020). In 2022, she starred in the television drama series &quot;Alaska Daily&quot;.

==Early life==
Swank was born on July 30, 1974, in Lincoln, Nebraska. Her mother, Judy Kay (&quot;née&quot; Clough), was a secretary and dancer, and her father, Stephen Michael Swank, was a Chief Master Sergeant in the Oregon Air National Guard and later a traveling salesman. Many of Swank&#x27;s family members are from Ringgold County, Iowa. Her maternal grandmother, Frances Martha Clough (&quot;née&quot; Domínguez), was born in El Centro, California, and was of Mexican descent. Swank&#x27;s paternal grandmother was born in England; her other ancestry includes Dutch, German, Ulster-Scots, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh. The surname &quot;Swank&quot;, originally &quot;Schwenk&quot;, is of German origin.

After living in Spokane, Washington, Swank&#x27;s family moved into a home near Lake Samish, near Bellingham, Washington, when Swank was six. She attended Happy Valley Elementary School, Fairhaven Middle School, then Sehome High School in Bellingham until she was 16. She competed in the Junior Olympics, the Washington state championships in swimming, and ranked fifth in the state in all-around gymnastics. Swank made her first appearance on stage when she was nine years old, starring in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

When Swank was 15, her parents separated, and her mother, supportive of her daughter&#x27;s desire to act, moved with her to Los Angeles, where they lived in their car until her mother saved enough money to rent an apartment. Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out. She described her time at that school: &quot;I felt like such an outsider. I didn&#x27;t feel like I fit in. I didn&#x27;t belong in any way. I didn&#x27;t even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn&#x27;t seen or understood.&quot; She explained that she became an actor because she felt like an outsider, &quot;As a kid I felt that I belonged only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed so much to be those other people, or at least to play them.&quot;

==Career==
Swank made her film debut in the 1992 comedy horror film &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, playing a supporting role, after which she acted in the direct-to-video drama &quot;Quiet Days in Hollywood&quot;, where she co-starred with Chad Lowe, to whom she was married from 1997 to 2007.

Her first leading film role was in the fourth installment of the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; series, &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994) as Julie Pierce. The role used her gymnastics background and paired her with Pat Morita. In 1994, she also starred in the drama, &quot;Cries Unheard: The Donna Yaklich Story&quot;, as the abused stepdaughter who was protected by Donna (Jaclyn Smith). In 1995, she appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in &quot;Kounterfeit&quot;. In 1996, she starred in a TV movie, family drama &quot;Terror in the Family,&quot; as a troubled teenager. In September 1997, Swank played single mother Carly Reynolds in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and was initially promised it would be a two-year role, but saw her character written out after 16 episodes in January 1998. Swank later stated that she was devastated at being cut from the show, thinking, &quot;If I&#x27;m not good enough for &quot;90210&quot;, I&#x27;m not good enough for anything.&quot;

The firing from &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; freed her to audition for the role of Brandon Teena in &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. To prepare for the role, Swank lived as a man for a month and reduced her body fat to 7%. She earned only $75 per day for her work on the film, culminating in a total of $3,000. Her earnings were so low that she had not even earned enough to qualify for health insurance. Upon release, many critics lauded her performance, with &quot;Premiere&quot; listing it as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;. James Berardinelli wrote at the time that Swank &quot;gives the performance of her career&quot;. Her work earned her several accolades, including the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; in 2020, Swank said that she felt a trans actor should have played the role, and had she been offered it today, she would have refused it, stating &quot;Twenty-one years later, not only are trans people having their lives and living, thankfully, although we still have a long way to go in their safety and their inclusivity, but we now have a bunch of trans actors who would obviously be a lot more right for the role and have the opportunity to actually audition for the role.&quot;

Swank again won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for playing a female boxer in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;, a role for which she underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts, gaining 19 pounds of muscle. With her second Oscar, she had joined the ranks of Vivien Leigh, Sally Field, and Luise Rainer as the only actresses to have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress twice and won both times. After winning her second Oscar, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I did in this life to deserve this. I&#x27;m just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.&quot;

In 2006, Swank signed a three-year contract with Guerlain to be the face of the women&#x27;s fragrance Insolence. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the motion picture category on January 8, 2007; it was the 2,325th star presented. In 2007, Swank starred in &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, about a real-life teacher, Erin Gruwell. Many reviews of her performance were positive, with one critic noting that she &quot;brings credibility&quot; to the role, and another stating that her performance reaches a &quot;singular lack of artifice, stripping herself back to the bare essentials&quot;. Swank next starred in the horror film &quot;The Reaping&quot; (2007), as a debunker of religious phenomena. Swank convinced the producers to move the film&#x27;s setting from New England to the Deep South, and the film was filmed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when Hurricane Katrina struck. The same year, she also appeared in the romantic drama &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; with Gerard Butler.

Swank portrayed the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart in the 2009 biopic &quot;Amelia&quot;, which she also co-executive produced through 2S Films, a production company she established with producer Molly Smith. In preparation for the role, she began a series of flight training lessons in a Cirrus SR22.

In 2012, Swank&#x27;s audiobook recording of Caroline Knapp&#x27;s &quot;Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs&quot; was released at Audible.com. In 2013, she starred in the television film &quot;Mary and Martha&quot; alongside Brenda Blethyn. In 2014, Swank played the lead role of Kate Parker, a woman whose life is shattered when she develops the degenerative disease ALS, in &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot;. The film co-starred Emmy Rossum and Josh Duhamel. In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Women.

In 2017, she appeared in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s heist comedy &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;, as Special Agent Sarah Grayson, alongside Channing Tatum and Daniel Craig, and portrayed lawyer Colette Hughes in Bille August&#x27;s drama film &quot;55 Steps&quot;. In 2018, Swank starred in and executive produced the Alzheimer&#x27;s disease drama film &quot;What They Had&quot;, directed by Elizabeth Chomko. Also in 2018, she portrayed Gail Getty in the first season of FX&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Trust&quot;. Swank was reported to star as Laura Murphy in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s drama series &quot;The One Percent&quot;.

In July 2019, Swank was cast in the thriller film &quot;The Hunt&quot;, opposite Betty Gilpin. Before its release, the film&#x27;s plot, about deadly violence between political liberals and conservatives caused controversy, after which its release was delayed by Universal from the original date of September 2019. Swank commented on the situation, stating: &quot;No one&#x27;s seen the film. You can&#x27;t really have a conversation about it without understanding what it&#x27;s about.&quot; The film was released in 2020, and received mixed reviews. In September 2020, Swank portrayed Emma, an astronaut, in the Netflix science drama series &quot;Away&quot;, which was canceled after one season. For both &quot;The Hunt&quot; and &quot;Away&quot;, Swank earned a total of three nominations at the 2021 Critics&#x27; Choice Super Awards.

== Other ventures ==

=== Clothing line ===
On October 18, 2016, Swank announced that she is launching a luxury clothing line, Mission Statement. The collection includes jackets, tops, dresses, bottoms, sports bras and sweaters that are made of eco-friendly technical fabrics, priced from $125 to $1,150. Swank aimed to create clothing that is eco-conscious and devoid of large logos, saying in an interview with &quot;DuJour&quot; that &quot;we believe in promoting the women wearing the clothes and not the brand itself, which is why there is no external branding.&quot; The brand works with suppliers that follow strict environmental policies and sustainable production practices.

=== Philanthropy ===
In July 2007, hair product brand Pantene, in partnership with the Entertainment Industry Foundation&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Fund, signed Swank to represent Pantene Beautiful Lengths charity campaign in 2008. The campaign encouraged people to donate their healthy hair to create free wigs for women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatment. Swank participated in Pantene&#x27;s Million Inch Chain program by cutting her hair and donating it.

Swank hosted and co-produced a two-hour television special, Fox&#x27;s &quot;Cause for Paws: An All-Star Dog Special&quot;, which aired on Thanksgiving night in 2014. The show celebrated the human-dog connection and rescue dogs. In 2014, The Petco Foundation honored Swank for her animal advocacy work and, in 2015, she received the Compassion Award by ASPCA. Also in 2015, Swank founded a nonprofit organization, the Hilaroo Foundation, which aims to bring at-risk teenagers and rescue dogs together in the hope that the two can heal each other. She was inspired to create the foundation after rescuing a dog called Karoo in South Africa.

In May 2024, Hilary Swank supported Ukraine and joined UNITED24 ambassadors and will raise funds for Ukraine.

==Personal life==
In a January 2009 episode of &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Prince Family Paper&quot;, the subplot of the episode is the office coworkers debating whether or not Hilary Swank is &quot;hot&quot;. Swank referred to such discussions emphasizing the looks of women in Hollywood as doing a &quot;disservice&quot;.

In October 2011, Swank attracted controversy for attending an event in Chechnya&#x27;s capital Grozny on the 35th birthday of Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov on October 5. After wishing him &quot;Happy birthday, Mr. President&quot;, she reportedly claimed knowledge about Kadyrov saying, &quot;I read. I do my research.&quot; Following criticism from human rights groups, that reported having informed her about the human rights abuses in Chechnya prior to the event and asked her to reconsider her participation, Swank said she was unaware that Kadyrov had been accused of human rights violations and that she &quot;deeply regrets&quot; taking part in the lavish concert. She donated her personal appearance fees &quot;to various charitable organizations&quot;.

In a 2020 interview with &quot;Health&quot;, Swank revealed that she took a three-year break from acting beginning in 2014 to help her father recover from a lung transplant.

She has been good friends with actress Mariska Hargitay after meeting on the set of television series &quot;ER.&quot; Hargitay was a maid of honor at Swank&#x27;s wedding to Philip Schneider in 2018.

=== Relationships ===
While filming &quot;Quiet Days in Hollywood&quot;, Swank met actor Chad Lowe. They married on September 28, 1997. They announced their intention to divorce on January 9, 2006, which was finalized on November 1, 2007. In 2007 Swank began dating her agent John Campisi, a relationship they ended in May 2012.

On March 22, 2016, Swank announced her engagement to Rubén Torres, a financial advisor with UBS and former professional tennis player. The two had been dating since May 2015. In June 2016, Swank&#x27;s representative confirmed that Torres and she had ended their engagement.

<doc id="92290" wikidata="Q716915" url="?curid=92290" title="Mechanical equilibrium">
<text>In classical mechanics, a particle is in mechanical equilibrium if the net force on that particle is zero. By extension, a physical system made up of many parts is in mechanical equilibrium if the net force on each of its individual parts is zero.

In addition to defining mechanical equilibrium in terms of force, there are many alternative definitions for mechanical equilibrium which are all mathematically equivalent. 
* In terms of momentum, a system is in equilibrium if the momentum of its parts is all constant.
* In terms of velocity, the system is in equilibrium if velocity is constant. * In a rotational mechanical equilibrium the angular momentum of the object is conserved and the net torque is zero. 

More generally in conservative systems, equilibrium is established at a point in configuration space where the gradient of the potential energy with respect to the generalized coordinates is zero.

If a particle in equilibrium has zero velocity, that particle is in static equilibrium. Since all particles in equilibrium have constant velocity, it is always possible to find an inertial reference frame in which the particle is stationary with respect to the frame.

== Stability ==
An important property of systems at mechanical equilibrium is their stability.

===Potential energy stability test===
In a function which describes the system&#x27;s potential energy, the system&#x27;s equilibria can be determined using calculus. A system is in mechanical equilibrium at the critical points of the function describing the system&#x27;s potential energy. These points can be located using the fact that the derivative of the function is zero at these points. To determine whether or not the system is stable or unstable, the second derivative test is applied. With formula_1 denoting the static equation of motion of a system with a single degree of freedom the following calculations can be performed: 

;Second derivative &lt; 0: The potential energy is at a local maximum, which means that the system is in an unstable equilibrium state. If the system is displaced an arbitrarily small distance from the equilibrium state, the forces of the system cause it to move even farther away.

;Second derivative &gt; 0: The potential energy is at a local minimum. This is a stable equilibrium. The response to a small perturbation is forces that tend to restore the equilibrium. If more than one stable equilibrium state is possible for a system, any equilibria whose potential energy is higher than the absolute minimum represent metastable states.

;Second derivative = 0: The state is neutral to the lowest order and nearly remains in equilibrium if displaced a small amount. To investigate the precise stability of the system, higher order derivatives can be examined. The state is unstable if the lowest nonzero derivative is of odd order or has a negative value, stable if the lowest nonzero derivative is both of even order and has a positive value. If all derivatives are zero then it is impossible to derive any conclusions from the derivatives alone. For example, the function formula_2 (defined as 0 in x=0) has all derivatives equal to zero. At the same time, this function has a local minimum in x=0, so it is a stable equilibrium. If this function is multiplied by the Sign function, all derivatives will still be zero but it will become an unstable equilibrium.

;Function is locally constant: In a truly neutral state the energy does not vary and the state of equilibrium has a finite width. This is sometimes referred to as a state that is marginally stable, or in a state of indifference, or astable equilibrium.

When considering more than one dimension, it is possible to get different results in different directions, for example stability with respect to displacements in the &quot;x&quot;-direction but instability in the &quot;y&quot;-direction, a case known as a saddle point. Generally an equilibrium is only referred to as stable if it is stable in all directions.

===Statically indeterminate system===

Sometimes the equilibrium equations force and moment equilibrium conditions are insufficient to determine the forces and reactions. Such a situation is described as &quot;statically indeterminate&quot;.

Statically indeterminate situations can often be solved by using information from outside the standard equilibrium equations.

== Examples ==
A stationary object (or set of objects) is in &quot;static equilibrium,&quot; which is a special case of mechanical equilibrium. A paperweight on a desk is an example of static equilibrium. Other examples include a rock balance sculpture, or a stack of blocks in the game of Jenga, so long as the sculpture or stack of blocks is not in the state of collapsing.

Objects in motion can also be in equilibrium. A child sliding down a slide at constant speed would be in mechanical equilibrium, but not in static equilibrium (in the reference frame of the earth or slide).

Another example of mechanical equilibrium is a person pressing a spring to a defined point. He or she can push it to an arbitrary point and hold it there, at which point the compressive load and the spring reaction are equal. In this state the system is in mechanical equilibrium. When the compressive force is removed the spring returns to its original state.

The minimal number of static equilibria of homogeneous, convex bodies (when resting under gravity on a horizontal surface) is of special interest. In the planar case, the minimal number is 4, while in three dimensions one can build an object with just one stable and one unstable balance point. Such an object is called a gömböc.

<text>Sewing is the craft of fastening pieces of textiles together using a sewing needle and thread. Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and leather clothing using bone, antler or ivory sewing-needles and &quot;thread&quot; made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins.

For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand. The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring, haute couture fashion, and custom dressmaking, and is pursued by both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative expression.

The first known use of the word &quot;sewing&quot; was in the 14th century. A person who sews may be called a seamstress, sewist, sewer, or stitcher.

==History==
===Origins===

Sewing has an ancient history estimated to begin during the Paleolithic Era. Sewing was used to stitch together animal hides for clothing and for shelter. The Inuit, for example, used sinew from caribou for thread and needles made of bone; the indigenous peoples of the American Plains and Canadian Prairies used sophisticated sewing methods to assemble tipi shelters. Sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves in Africa to create baskets, such as those made by Zulu weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as &quot;thread&quot; to stitch wider strips of palm leaf that had been woven into a coil. The weaving of cloth from natural fibers originated in the Middle East around 4000 BC, and perhaps earlier during the Neolithic Age, and the sewing of cloth accompanied this development.

During the Middle Ages, Europeans who could afford it employed seamstresses and tailors. The vital importance of sewing was indicated by the honorific position of &quot;Lord Sewer&quot; at many European coronations from the Middle Ages. An example was Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex who was appointed Lord Sewer at the coronation of Henry VIII of England in 1509. Sewing for the most part was a woman&#x27;s occupation, and most sewing before the 19th century was practical. Clothing was an expensive investment for most people, and women had an important role in extending the longevity of items of clothing. Sewing was used for mending. Clothing that was faded would be turned inside-out so that it could continue to be worn, and sometimes had to be taken apart and reassembled to suit this purpose. Once clothing became worn or torn, it would be taken apart and the reusable cloth sewn together into new items of clothing, made into quilts, or otherwise put to practical use. The many steps involved in making clothing from scratch (weaving, pattern making, cutting, alterations, and so forth) meant that women often bartered their expertise in a particular skill with one another. Decorative needlework such as embroidery was a valued skill, and young women with the time and means would practice to build their skill in this area. From the Middle Ages to the 17th century, sewing tools such as needles, pins and pincushions were included in the trousseaus of many European brides. Sewing birds or sewing clamps were used as a third hand and were popular gifts for seamstresses in the 19th century. 

Decorative embroidery was valued in many cultures worldwide. Although most embroidery stitches in the Western repertoire are traditionally British, Irish or Western European in origin, stitches originating in different cultures are known throughout the world today. Some examples are the Cretan Open Filling stitch, Romanian Couching or Oriental Couching, and the Japanese stitch. The stitches associated with embroidery spread by way of the trade routes that were active during the Middle Ages. The Silk Road brought Chinese embroidery techniques to Western Asia and Eastern Europe, while techniques originating in the Middle East spread to Southern and Western Europe through Morocco and Spain. European imperial settlements also spread embroidery and sewing techniques worldwide. However, there are instances of sewing techniques indigenous to cultures in distant locations from one another, where cross-cultural communication would have been historically unlikely. For example, a method of reverse appliqué known to areas of South America is also known to Southeast Asia.

===Industrial Revolution===

The Industrial Revolution shifted the production of textiles from the household to the mills. In the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, the machinery produced whole cloth. The world&#x27;s first sewing machine was patented in 1790 by Thomas Saint. By the early 1840s, other early sewing machines began to appear. Barthélemy Thimonnier introduced a simple sewing machine in 1841 to produce military uniforms for France&#x27;s army; shortly afterward, a mob of tailors broke into Thimonnier&#x27;s shop and threw the machines out of the windows, believing the machines would put them out of work. By the 1850s, Isaac Singer developed the first sewing machines that could operate quickly and accurately and surpass the productivity of a seamstress or tailor sewing by hand.

While much clothing was still produced at home by female members of the family, more and more ready-made clothes for the middle classes were being produced with sewing machines. Textile sweatshops full of poorly paid sewing machine operators grew into entire business districts in large cities like London and New York City. To further support the industry, piece work was done for little money by women living in slums. Needlework was one of the few occupations considered acceptable for women, but it did not pay a living wage. Women working from home often worked 14-hour days to earn enough to support themselves, sometimes by renting sewing machines that they could not afford to buy.

Tailors became associated with higher-end clothing during this period. In London, this status grew out of the dandy trend of the early 19th century, when new tailor shops were established around Savile Row. These shops acquired a reputation for sewing high-quality handmade clothing in the style of the latest British fashions, as well as more classic styles. The boutique culture of Carnaby Street was absorbed by Savile Row tailors during the late 20th century, ensuring the continued flourishing of Savile Row&#x27;s businesses.

Historian Judith Bennett explains that the nature of women&#x27;s work maintained a consistent pattern from the medieval period through the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized by tasks that were low-profit, low-volume, and low-skilled, often performed alongside other responsibilities. Similarly, Judy Lown argues that although women&#x27;s work transitioned from the household to the factory, its essence—remaining low-skilled and poorly paid—persisted without significant change.

The transition to industrialization introduced a growing dependence on cash income in Northwestern Europe. For many working-class families, opportunities to earn wages were often located in distant cities, prompting many girls to leave their rural homes and migrate to urban areas. The changing nature of work in general raised questions about how women fit into rising industrialization and how both men and women should navigate gender roles. One of the concerns of the 19th century was the impact of industrialization on women&#x27;s morality. According to Mariana Valverde, many male factory workers and union leaders alike argued that women working in industrial settings would be contrary to their nature and symbolized a &quot;return to barbarism.&quot;  

This perception not only reflected prevailing gender biases but also influenced labor policies and union strategies, which often sought to exclude women from better-paying industrial jobs. Such debates reinforced the belief that women were best suited for domestic roles or low-skilled work, limiting their economic opportunities and perpetuating a cycle of inequality.

===20th century onward===

Sewing underwent further developments during the 20th century. As sewing machines became more affordable to the working class, demand for sewing patterns grew. Women had become accustomed to seeing the latest fashions in periodicals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, increasing demand for sewing patterns yet more. American tailor and manufacturer Ebenezer Butterick met the demand with paper patterns that could be traced and used by home sewers. The patterns, sold in small packets, became wildly popular. Several pattern companies soon established themselves. Women&#x27;s magazines also carried sewing patterns, and continued to do so for much of the 20th century. This practice declined during the later decades of the 20th century, when ready-made clothing became a necessity as women joined the paid workforce in larger numbers, leaving them with less time to sew, if indeed they had an interest. Today, the low price of ready-made clothing in shops means that home sewing is confined largely to hobbyists in Western countries, with the exception of cottage industries in custom dressmaking and upholstery. Sewing as a pleasurable hobby has gained popularity as attested by the BBC televisions show The Great British Sewing Bee, on air since 2013.

The spread of sewing machine technology to industrialized economies around the world meant the spread of Western-style sewing methods and clothing styles as well. In Japan, traditional clothing was sewn together with running stitch that could be removed so that the clothing could be taken apart and the assorted pieces laundered separately. The tight-locked stitches made by home sewing machines, and the use of Western clothing patterns, led to a movement towards wearing Western-style clothing during the early 20th century. Western sewing and clothing styles were disseminated in sub-Saharan Africa by Christian missionaries from the 1830s onward. Indigenous cultures, such as the Zulu and Tswana, were indoctrinated in the Western way of dress as a sign of conversion to Christianity. First Western hand sewing techniques, and later machine sewing, spread throughout the regions where the European colonists settled. However, a recent examination of new online learning methods demonstrated that technology can be adapted to share knowledge of a culture&#x27;s traditional sewing methods. Using self-paced online tutorials, a Malay sewing class learned how to tailor and sew a traditional men&#x27;s &quot;Baju Kurung&quot; garment in 3 days, whereas a traditional Malay sewing class would have taken 5 days to teach the same information.
Advances in industrial technology, such as the development of synthetic fibres during the early 20th century, have brought profound changes to the textile industry as a whole. Textile industries in Western countries have declined sharply as textile companies compete for cheaper labour in other parts of the world. According to the U.S. Department of Labor &quot;employment of sewers and tailors is expected to experience little or no change, growing 1 percent from 2010 to 2020&quot;. It is estimated that every lost textile job in a Western country in recent years has resulted in 1.5 jobs being created in an outsourced country such as China. Textile workers who perform tasks with sewing machines, or do detailed work by hand, are still a vital component of the industry, however. Small-scale sewing is also an economic standby in many developing countries, where many people, both male and female, are self-employed sewers.

==Garment construction==

===Patterns and fitting===
Garment construction is usually guided by a sewing pattern. A pattern can be quite simple; some patterns are nothing more than a mathematical formula that the sewer calculates based on the intended wearer&#x27;s measurements. Once calculated, the sewer has the measurements needed to cut the cloth and sew the garment together. At the other end of the spectrum are haute couture fashion designs. When a couture garment is made of unusual material, or has extreme proportions, the design may challenge the sewer&#x27;s engineering knowledge. Complex designs are drafted and refitted dozens of times, may take around 40 hours to develop a final pattern, and require 60 hours of cutting and sewing. It is important for a pattern to be created well because the way a completed piece fits is the reason it will either be worn or not.

Most clothing today is mass-produced, and conforms to standard sizing, based on body measurements that are intended to fit the greatest proportion of the population. However, while &quot;standard&quot; sizing is generally a useful guideline, it is little more than that, because there is no industry standard that is &quot;both widely accepted and strictly adhered to in all markets&quot;.

Home sewers often work from sewing patterns purchased from companies such as Simplicity, Butterick, McCall&#x27;s, Vogue, and many others. Such patterns are typically printed on large pieces of tissue paper; a sewer may simply cut out the required pattern pieces for use but may choose to transfer the pattern onto a thicker paper if repeated use is desired. A sewer may choose to alter a pattern to make it more accurately fit the intended wearer. Patterns may be changed to increase or decrease length; to add or remove fullness; to adjust the position of the waistline, shoulder line, or any other seam, or a variety of other adjustments. Volume can be added with elements such as pleats, or reduced with the use of darts. Before work is started on the final garment, test garments may be made, sometimes referred to as muslins.

===Tools===
Sewers working on a simple project need only a few sewing tools, such as flexible measuring tape, needle, thread, cloth, and sewing shears, but there are many helpful sewing aids and specialized tools available. 

Rotary cutters may also be used for cutting fabric, usually used with a cutting mat to protect other surfaces from being damaged. Seam rippers are used to remove mistaken stitches or basting stitches. Special washable markers or chalk are used to mark the fabric as a guide to construction.

Pressing and ironing are an essential part of any sewing project, and require additional tools. A steam iron is used to press seams and garments, and a variety of pressing aids such as a seam roll or tailor&#x27;s ham are used to aid in shaping a garment. A pressing cloth may be used to protect the fabric from damage. A velvet board helps to iron velvet without crushing it. 

Sewing machines are now made for a broad range of specialised sewing purposes, such as quilting machines, heavy-duty machines for sewing thicker fabrics (such as leather), computerized machines for embroidery, and sergers for finishing raw edges of fabric.

A wide variety of presser foot attachments are available for many sewing machines—feet exist to help with hemming, pintucks, attaching cording, assembling patchwork, quilting, and a variety of other functions.
A thimble is a small hard tool used to protect fingertips while hand sewing.

===Elements===
Seamstresses are provided with the pattern, while tailors would draft their own pattern, both with the intent of using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the grain or the bias to manipulate fabric stretch. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.

Supporting materials, such as interfacing, interlining, or lining, may be used in garment construction, to give the fabric a more rigid or durable shape.

Before or after the pattern pieces are cut, it is often necessary to mark the pieces to provide a guide during the sewing process. Marking methods may include using pens, pencils, or chalk, tailor&#x27;s tacks, snips, pins, or thread tracing, among others.

In addition to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. Seam types include the plain seam, zigzag seam, flat fell seam, French seam and many others.

===Software===
With the development of cloth simulation software such as CLO3D, Marvelous Designer and Optitex, seamsters can now draft patterns on the computer and visualize clothing designs by using the pattern creation tools and virtual sewing machines within these cloth simulation programs.

==In non-human animals==

Tailorbirds (genus &quot;Orthotomus&quot;), such as the common tailorbird, exhibit sewing behaviour, as do some birds of related genera. They are capable of stitching together the edges of leaves, using plant fibres or spider silk as thread, in order to create cavities in which to build their nests.

<text>Władysław I Łokietek, in English known as the &quot;Elbow-high&quot; or Ladislaus the Short (c. 1260/12 March 1333), was King of Poland from 1320 to 1333, and duke of several of the provinces and principalities in the preceding years. He was a member of the royal Piast dynasty, the son of Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia, and great-grandson of High-Duke Casimir II the Just.

Władysław I inherited a small portion of his father&#x27;s domain, but his dominion grew as some of his brothers died young. He unsuccessfully tried to incorporate the Duchy of Kraków (the Seniorate Province) in 1289, following the death of his half-brother Leszek II the Black and the withdrawal from contention of his ally Bolesław II of Masovia. After a period in exile during the rule of Wenceslaus II, Władysław regained several duchies and then Kraków in 1306 when Wenceslaus III was murdered. He temporarily took control of part of Greater Poland after the death of his ally Przemysł II, lost it, and then regained it.

Władysław was a skilled military leader, but also an administrator; he conquered Gdańsk Pomerania, and left it to familial governors. For the defense of this territory, he turned to the Teutonic Knights, who then demanded an exorbitant sum, or the land itself as an alternative. This led to an extended conflict with the Knights.

Perhaps his greatest achievement was gaining papal permission to be crowned king of Poland in 1320, which occurred for the first time at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. Władysław died in 1333 and was succeeded by his son, Casimir III the Great.

==Life==
===Background===

In 1138, the Kingdom of Poland, which had been growing in strength under the rule of the Piast dynasty, encountered an obstacle which impeded its development for nearly two hundred years. In the will of King Bolesław III Wrymouth (&quot;Bolesław III Krzywousty&quot;), Poland was divided into five provinces: Silesia, Mazovia with eastern Kuyavia, Greater Poland, the Sandomierz Region, and the Seniorate Province. The Seniorate Province initially comprised Kraków and western Lesser Poland, eastern Greater Poland including Gniezno and Kalisz, western Kuyavia, Łęczyca and Sieradz (maintained by the Dowager Duchess Salomea of Berg for her lifetime), and with Pomerelia as a fiefdom. To prevent his four sons from quarreling, Bolesław granted one province to each of them, while the Seniorate Province was to be given to the eldest brother on the grounds of primogeniture. This decision was meant to forestall dynastic feuds and prevent the disintegration of the kingdom. However, it proved inadequate, and began nearly two centuries of what it had sought to counteract: constant fighting and disorder. Władysław I succeeded in re-uniting most of these lands back into the kingdom of Poland.

Władysław I Łokietek was the oldest son of Casimir I of Kuyavia (&quot;Kazimierz I Kujawski&quot;) and his third wife Euphrosyne of Opole. He was only third in seniority to be Duke of Kuyavia, however, as he had two older half-brothers from Casimir&#x27;s second marriage to Constance of Wrocław: Leszek II the Black (&quot;Leszek Czarny&quot;) and Ziemomysł. He was named after his uncle, his mother&#x27;s brother Władysław, Duke of Opole. 

In contemporary historical sources he was nicknamed &quot;Łokietek&quot;, a diminutive of the word &quot;łokieć&quot; which means &quot;elbow&quot; or &quot;ell&quot; (a medieval unit of measure similar to a cubit, as in &quot;elbow-high&quot;). However, the origin and the intended meaning of the nickname are not certain. The earliest explanation appeared in a 15th-century chronicle by Jan Długosz, who speculated that the nickname referred to the short stature of the king. In 2019, a team of archeologists endoscopically reached the interior of the king&#x27;s tomb and found that the body was laid at the bottom of the burial chamber without a coffin. Subsequently, they were able to determine that Władysław I was 152-155 cm (5&#x27;0″-5&#x27;1″) tall, which meant that the king&#x27;s height was just below that of an average person living in Europe during the Middle Ages. In the past, some historians hypothesized that the nickname Łokietek had nothing to do with the physical appearance of prince Władysław, but contemptuously described the actual size and political importance of his hereditary domain among the other principalities ruled by the members of the House of Piast, at least as compared to Łokietek&#x27;s exaggerated ambitions. If this hypothesis is correct, Władysław Łokietek should be rather translated into English as Władysław the Petty. Jan Długosz may have easily misinterpreted the nickname, being chronologically remote to the political context of Łokietek&#x27;s era.

===Prince in Kuyavia (1267–1288)===
In 1267, when Władysław I Łokietek was seven years old, his father Casimir died. At this time, Leszek II the Black inherited Łęczyca (he had already been given Sieradz six years earlier), Ziemomysł gained Inowrocław, and Brześć Kujawski and Dobrzyń were held in regency by Euphrosyne on behalf of Władysław and his younger brothers Casimir II and Siemowit. After the death of his father, Władysław was sent to Kraków to the court of his relative, Bolesław V the Chaste (1st cousin once removed). In 1273 Władysław participated in the arbitration by Bolesław the Pious, duke of Greater Poland, to reconcile him and his mother Euphrosyne with the Teutonic Knights. Władysław took responsibility for governing these territories in 1275, but they were actually held in a &quot;niedzial&quot; (collective property of the family community) with his two younger brothers.

In October 1277, lands destined for his younger brother Casimir II were invaded by Lithuanians, who, after the abduction of prisoners and seizure of loot, freely returned home. This was a result of being the proteges of Bolesław V the Chaste, who at this time was in the opposite political camp (proczeskim) from Konrad II, Duke of Mazovia, through whose land the Lithuanian invasion passed. Two years later, in 1279, Władysław I Łokietek was considered to be one of the contenders to succeed in Lesser Poland after the death of Bolesław V the Chaste, according to the Hypatian Codex. However, the nobility abided by Boleslaw&#x27;s will, which had designated Władysław&#x27;s elder half-brother Leszek II the Black as his heir.

After Leszek II the Black&#x27;s acquisition of power in Kraków and Sandomierz in 1279, Władysław, along with his younger brothers, recognized Leszek&#x27;s sovereignty. This resulted in, among other things, the adoption of a coat of arms by all of the sons of Casimir I Kujawski: half-lion, half-eagle, and afterwards Władysław always served as an ally to his older half-brother. In 1280, Władysław militarily helped Leszek&#x27;s ally, the Mazovian Prince Bolesław II, in a battle with Bolesław&#x27;s brother, Konrad II, and during the expedition won the castle of Jazdów. It is also possible that at a meeting between Leszek II the Black and Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland, in Sieradz in February 1284, the marriage of Władysław to Jadwiga, a cousin of Przemysł, was discussed. The following year, in August, Władysław was present, along with Przemysl II and Ziemomysł of Kuyavia, when finalizing the reform of the Sulejów monastery, i.e., taking in the monks from the Wąchock monastic buildings. After this event Władysław again appeared in Mazovia, where he supported Bolesław II in combat with Konrad II, probably on behalf of Leszek II the Black. In retaliation for this action, Konrad II once again let the Lithuanian army pass through his land, which in 1287 besieged Dobrzyń.

===Death of Leszek the Black and the struggle for control of Kraków (1288–1289)===
On 30 September 1288, Leszek II the Black, Duke of Kraków and Sieradz, died without issue, thus transferring power in the principality of Sieradz to his eldest half-brother, Władysław I Łokietek (his full brother Ziemomysł had already died in 1287). While Władysław now ruled over Brześć Kujawski and Sieradz, Casimir II inherited the duchy of Łęczyca, and Siemowit assumed control of the land of Dobrzyń.

The death of Leszek initiated a struggle for supremacy in the duchies of Kraków and Sandomierz; the main candidates were Bolesław II, Duke of Mazovia, and Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław. In this contest, Władysław decided to support the former. Henry IV Probus, using the support of the powerful German patricians, mastered the capital city at the end of 1288. Bolesław II did not give up, however, and aided by support from Władysław, Władysław&#x27;s brother Casimir II Łęczycki, and perhaps troops from Przemysł II, he attacked branches of the Probus coalition—Henry III of Głogów, Bolko I of Opole, and Przemko of Ścinawa—who were returning to Silesia. On 26 February 1289, a bloody battle occurred on the fields near Siewierz (Przemko of Ścinawa died there), resulting in a great victory for the branches of Mazovia-Kuyavia.

===Duke of Sandomierz and war with Wenceslaus II (1289–1292)===

After the Battle of Siewierz, Bolesław II of Mazovia resigned from applying for the Seniorate Province for unknown reasons, and so Władysław the Short began to style himself the Duke of Kraków and Sandomierz. He occupied the capital of Lesser Poland (but without Wawel Castle), yet despite initial victories in the battles of Skała and Święcica, Władysław could not make it permanent. Soon Kraków was acquired by Henry IV Probus, and Władysław had to escape the city with the help of the Franciscans. In the second half of 1289 the Kujavian prince managed to consolidate his rule in the Duchy of Sandomierz. This resulted in a division of Lesser Poland back into the two distinct principalities (Kraków and Sandomierz), as they had been ruled by the same duke since Bolesław V the Chaste became High Duke in 1243.

On 23 June 1290, Henry IV Probus died, and Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland, assumed the throne of Kraków. It is not known exactly how the relationship was between Przemysł II and Władysław I Łokietek, although it is very likely that they were friendly, as the division took place without bloodshed and may have been the result of a settlement between the princes. It is possible, however, that these relations could have been cool, and perhaps even hostile. Przemysł II mastered Wawel Castle without problems, but from the beginning he faced considerable internal opposition from within the principality of Kraków – some of whom supported Władysław the Short, while others supported Wenceslaus II of Bohemia – and by mid-September 1290 Przemysł II left Kraków to return to Greater Poland. Meanwhile, in order to further increase his contemporary significance, Władysław gave his niece Fenenna (daughter of his half-brother Ziemomysł) in marriage to Andrew III, the Hungarian king of the Arpad dynasty.

Przemysł II finally gave up power over Kraków in mid-January of the following year (1291), and the principality then accepted the Czech monarch Wenceslaus II as their sovereign. Władysław decided to fight for Lesser Poland with the help of Hungarian troops granted to him by Andrew III. In 1292 Bohemian troops, through numerical superiority and with support from Silesian princes and the Margrave of Brandenburg, drove Władysław the Short first from Sandomierz, and in September of that same year surrounded him in a fortified Sieradz. The siege was soon successful, and Władysław and his brother Casimir II found themselves in captivity. On 9 October 1292 an agreement was signed under which Władysław and Casimir II were forced to renounce claims to Lesser Poland and to make fealty to the Czech ruler, in return for which they remained on their Kuyavian leases.

===Collaboration with Przemysł II (1293–1296)===
Their recent failures and the threat of Wenceslaus II prompted Przemysł II and Władysław, the existing Polish competitors for the throne of Kraków, to meet in Kalisz in January 1293 in order to develop strategies for removing the Czech government. The reconciliation of the opponents occurred as a result of the intervention of Archbishop Jakub Świnka; for his part the archbishop was promised the revenues from the salt mines after Lesser Poland was won. The secret agreement, signed 6 January 1293, committed the three princes (the arrangement was also attended by Casimir II of Łęczyca) to mutual support in the effort to recover Kraków. At that time they probably developed a to guarantee mutual inheritance in the event of the recovery of Kraków. The occasion of this congress may have also marked the marriage of Władysław the Short with Jadwiga, the daughter of Bolesław the Pious, uncle of Przemysł II.

One year later (1294), it was already necessary to revise the plans approved in Kalisz, as Casimir II was killed while fighting against the Lithuanians. As a result, Łęczyca was added to the lands of Władysław the Short. On 26 June 1295, Przemysł II was crowned as the Polish king with the permission of the Pope. Władysław&#x27;s response to this development is unknown. Unfortunately, the new king enjoyed his coronation for only seven months, as on 8 February 1296 Przemysł II was murdered, perhaps incited by the Margraves of Brandenburg.

===Marriage===
When Przemysł II was still alive Władysław I Łokietek married Jadwiga, daughter of Bolesław the Pious. There are three main theories among historians as to when the wedding took place. The most historic assumes that the marriage took place during the life of Jadwiga&#x27;s father, and so no later than 1279. The second theory, which now has the most supporters, is that the wedding took place between 1290 and 1293, possibly at the conclusion of the meeting in Kalisz in January 1293, and that in 1279 there was perhaps only an engagement (). The third theory posits a specific date of the marriage as 23 April 1289.

===Initial efforts in Greater Poland (1296–1298)===
For wealthy Greater Poland, it became evident that the throne of Przemysł II deserved his closest ally, Prince Władysław of Kuyavia. The fact that Władysław the Short was known to dislike the Germans was not irrelevant, as they were generally regarded as the perpetrators of the murder of Przemsył II. However, there was a testament of Przemysł II, written about 1290, recognizing Henry III of Głogów as his heir. Neither party wanted bloody battles, and so an arrangement was made on 10 March 1296 in Krzywiń in which Władysław agreed to give Henry III the part of Greater Poland west and south of the rivers Obra and Warta up to the mouth of the Noteć. Władysław also established his successor in the event he died without a male heir: Henry IV the Faithful, Henry III&#x27;s eldest son. Also, regardless of the future birth of any sons of his own, Władysław agreed to give the duchy of Poznań to Henry IV Faithful when he reached adulthood.

The division of Greater Poland that was agreed upon in Krzywiń did not address all of the contentious issues, especially in light of the fact that male heirs of Władysław the Short soon came into the world. The governments of Władysław I Łokietek in his part of Greater Poland were not successful because banditry was spreading there and internal opposition grew stronger, headed by Andrzej Zaremba, the bishop of Poznań. It was suspected, though denied by some historians, that Bishop Zaremba placed a curse of the church on Władysław. In addition, Archbishop Jakub Świnka, seeing that the Duke of Kuyavia was having problems with proper governance, began distancing himself from his earlier protege. In 1298, a meeting between the opposition from Greater Poland and Henry III of Głogów occurred in Kościan to conclude an agreement under which, in return for renewed offices for the opposition in a future reunited duchy, they would support Henry&#x27;s candidacy for the throne of Greater Poland.

===Flight from the country (1299–1304)===
The real threat to Władysław&#x27;s power actually came from the south. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia decided to crack down on the Duke of Kuyavia. In 1299 in Klęka an agreement was concluded under which Władysław the Short agreed to resubmit homage to Wenceslaus II, in return for which he would receive 400 grzywnas and an eight-year income from the mines in Olkusz. Władysław, however, did not keep the terms and conditions made in Klęka, and in July 1299 Wenceslaus II organized a military expedition that resulted in the Kujavian prince fleeing the country.

It is not known exactly where Władysław the Short lived during the years 1300–1304. According to tradition, he went to Rome, where he took part in the celebration of the great jubilee of 1300 organized by Pope Boniface VIII. Other places he might have stayed were Ruthenia and Hungary, with whose magnates Władysław had allied relations. During that time, Władysław&#x27;s spouse Jadwiga and their children stayed in Kuyavia in the town of Radziejow in the guise of ordinary townspeople.

===Recovery of Kuyavia, Lesser Poland, and Gdańsk Pomerania (1304–1306)===
Władysław I Łokietek returned to Lesser Poland in 1304 with an army of his supporters, which, according to the 15th-century historian Jan Długosz, consisted of more peasants than knights. He settled in Sandomierz with the help of the Hungarian magnate Amadeus Aba. Later that same year he was able to master the castles in Wiślica and Lelów. Success for the indomitable prince would have been short-lived, if not for several favorable circumstances. On 21 June 1305, Wenceslaus II, the Czech and Polish king, died unexpectedly and his inheritance passed to his only son, Wenceslaus III. Władysław took advantage of the situation perfectly, mastering the duchies of Sandomierz, Sieradz-Łęczyca, and Brześć Kujawski by the end of the year. The declining Czech government tried to support Wenceslaus III by organizing an expedition against Władysław. Again luck favored Władysław, as on 4 August 1306, Wenceslaus III was murdered in Olomouc in Moravia, and the Kingdom of Bohemia was without a monarch and in the heat of a civil war.

The death of the last Přemyslid on the Bohemian throne resulted in a rally of knights in Kraków, which led to an official invitation to Władysław the Short to take power. There was a festive entrance to the capital of Lesser Poland on 1 September 1306, and this has been linked with the issuance of privilege for the city and for the current leading advocate of Czech rule, Jan Muskata, the bishop of Kraków.

Another goal of Władysław I Łokietek was to regain the inheritance of Przemysł II: Greater Poland and Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania). This unification campaign, however, encountered considerable difficulties. In Greater Poland, Władysław managed to only take control of the Kuyavia-border towns of Konin, Koło, and Nakło, because the rest of the duchy had accepted the rule of his old enemy Henry III of Głogów (except Wielun which was occupied by prince Bolko I of Opole). Pomerelia, however, became subordinate to the rule of Władysław the Short as a result of an expedition at the end of 1306, accepting tribute from representatives of Pomeranian society in Byszewo. Control over this remote area had to be transferred to governors. Władysław no longer trusted the Pomeranian Swienca family, so despite leaving Peter Swienca, the senior family member, as voivode, the role of governor was given to his two nephews (the sons of Ziemomysł). Przemysł became governor of Świecie and Casimir III took Gdańsk and Tczew.

===Annexation of Pomerelia by the Teutonic Knights (1307–1309)===
Meanwhile, Gerward, the bishop of Kuyavia (Włocławek), appeared against the Peter Swienca family and demanded that they return episcopal income stolen from him when Peter was governor for the Czech Kingdom. Peter lost the arbitration process, which ordered him to return to the Bishop the enormous amount of 2,000 grzywnas. Despite a partial guarantee by Władysław the Short, the Swienca family was unable to pay such a sum; therefore, on 17 July 1307 they changed their allegiance from Władysław to Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg, and received from him in fief the towns of Darłowo, Polanowo, Sławno, Tuchola, and Nowe, and received in perpetuity the Land of Slupsk. In August 1307, Waldemar attacked Pomerelia. Resistance to the invaders on behalf of the Władysław the Short came from Bogusz, a Pomerelian judge who entrenched himself in the city of Gdańsk. It soon became clear, however, that his forces could not cope with the aggressors.
On the advice of the German prior of the Dominican Order in Gdańsk, Władysław I Łokietek decided to bring the Teutonic Order in to help. At first it seemed that all went well, as the knights under Gunther von Schwarzburg, the commander of Chełmno, successfully drove the Brandenburgs from Gdańsk and then moved on to Tczew. However, the Prussian Grand Master did not listen to Prince Casimir, Władysław&#x27;s governor residing in Tczew, and without a struggle took the city. Then the Knights took Nowe and in 1308 completed the campaign. Only Świecie remained in the hands of Władysław the Short. In April 1309 in Kuyavia there was a meeting between Władysław the Short and the Prussian Grand Master about the seizure of Pomerelia at which the Teutonic Order issued to the Prince an absurd bill for the relief of Gdańsk, and then offered to purchase the territory. Both proposals were rejected by Wladyslaw. Consequently, in July 1309, the Teutonic Knights began the siege of Świecie. The garrison surrendered the city only in September. In order to legitimize their conduct, the Knights purchased in September a questionable right to the district from Brandenburg. The annexation of Pomerelia enabled the Grand Master to finally transfer their capital from Venice to Malbork.

===Coping with internal opposition – Jan Muskata and the rebellion of mayor Albert (1308–1312)===
The reason that Władysław the Short could not be involved directly in Pomerelian affairs was the unstable situation in Lesser Poland. The source of the unrest was Jan Muskata, the bishop of Kraków and a former follower of Wenceslaus II. Muskata began to sow discord against Władysław soon after he gained the throne of Kraków by trying to establish contacts with his enemies Bolko I of Opole and Henry III of Głogów. To help the Prince of Kraków came the venerable archbishop of Gniezno, Jakub Swinka. On 14 June 1308, Swinka deprived Muskata of his bishopric for abuse of power. Using judgment, Władysław imprisoned the bishop for only half a year, and then forced him to leave the boundaries of the principality. Muskata did not return to Kraków until 1317.

In 1311, Władysław the Short survived another crisis of his reign. This time the threat came from within Kraków, where the local German nobility said that they now supported and would obey John of Luxembourg, the new king of Bohemia. The reason for this state of affairs was the excessive (in their opinion) tax burden caused by the policy of unification of the Polish lands and the economic crisis associated with the loss of Pomerelia. At the head of the revolt was Albert, the mayor of Kraków, who called to the city Duke Bolko I of Opole. The rebels managed to control Kraków and gain the support of several other cities in Lesser Poland, but Wawel was saved by troops loyal to Władysław, which made the chances of a successful rebellion questionable. The situation had not changed when the Duke of Opole arrived in April 1312. Historians debate whether Bolko I came to Kraków for his own purposes, or rather as a governor on behalf of the new Czech king, John of Bohemia, who was also using the title of King of Poland. However, John could not support this militant rebellion as a result of the problems he faced in Moravia with his own rebels. In any case, attempts to capture Wawel Castle failed, and strengthened by Hungarian support, Władysław the Short mastered the rebellion in Sandomierz and forced Bolko I of Opole to leave Kraków in June 1312. Upon returning to Opole, Bolko kidnapped mayor Albert and for unknown reasons had him imprisoned (perhaps to recover by ransom the costs incurred in connection with the trip to Kraków). After ending the rebellion, Władysław proceeded to punish the rebels. The penalties were severe; some councilors were hanged and their property confiscated, and the city of Kraków itself lost some of its privileges (e.g., hereditary headmen). Soon after the rebellion Latin was introduced to the books of the city rather than German.

===Mastering Greater Poland (1309–1315)===
On 9 December 1309, Henry III of Głogów—who had claimed to be the successor of King Przemysł II and was the main competitor of Władysław the Short for the duchy of Greater Poland—died, leaving his district to be divided between his five sons. Henry, Jan, and Przemko received Poznań, and Bolesław and Konrad received Gniezno and Kalisz, which they divided respectively one year later. This division formed a new territorial organization based on the cities, instead of the previous castellan division. This threatened the local elite, and so in 1314 the nobility and knights raised a rebellion against the sons of Henry III of Głogow. These events surprised the dukes such that they could not effectively stop the rebellion, and their troops sent under the command of Janusz Biberstein suffered defeat. Seeking an independent political position, the local knighthood also gained Poznań, which was defended by the mayor Przemek and the townspeople. The knights of Greater Poland, knowing about Władysław&#x27;s suppression of the rebellion of mayor Albert in Kraków, discerned that he was a defender of their economic and political interests. The result was the transfer of power to Władysław, who entered Poznań in August 1314. After the events in Poznań he began to designate himself as the prince of the Polish Kingdom.

The dukes were forced to come to terms with the loss of Greater Poland, as they remained only with part of the territories bordering the rivers Obra and Noteć.

The recovery of Greater Poland allowed Władysław entry into broader international politics. In 1315, Poland concluded an alliance against Brandenburg with the three monarchies of Scandinavia: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, as well as the duchies of Mecklenburg and Pomerania. The war broke out a year later; however, it did not bring success and only caused the destruction of frontier territories.

===Coronation (1315–1320)===
Around that time, Wladyslaw the Short also began efforts to obtain papal consent for a royal coronation. This plan was actively supported by the Polish church, led by Borzysław, the archbishop of Gniezno (the successor of Jakub Swinka who died in 1314), and Gerward, the bishop of Kuyavia (Włocławek). The decision about the coronation was ultimately made during two rallies of nobles and knights; the first was held from 20 to 23 June 1318 in Sulejow, where a special supplication was prepared with a request to the Pope, and the second on 29 June in Pyzdry. Bishop Gerward was sent to Avignon with the documents. The successful arrangement featured a replacement method of calculating the papal pence on terms favorable for the papacy.

Consent was given by Pope John XXII on 20 August 1319, though not directly due to the opposition of King John of Bohemia, who also claimed the crown of Poland. The Pope was looking for a way to preserve the rights of Władysław and Poland without infringing on those of John and Bohemia, and found that the Luxembourg claims (despite their tenuous legal basis) referred to Greater Poland, the &quot;kingdom&quot; of Przemysł II. As such, Kraków was chosen for the coronation instead of Gniezno, in that a coronation in Kraków would not violate the rights of John of Bohemia. On 20 January 1320 in the Wawel Cathedral, Janisław, the Archbishop of Gniezno (succeeding Borzysław), crowned Władysław as King of Poland. Placing the rite of Polish coronation in Kraków, however, caused John to question its legality. In light of John of Bohemia&#x27;s use of the title King of Poland, in the international arena Władysław the Short was considered the King of Kraków, and not of the whole country.

The year 1320 was important for the politics of Władysław I Łokietek for other reasons. On 14 April 1320 in Inowrocław, and then in Brześć Kujavia, he began deliberations with the papal court to judge the case of the annexation of Gdańsk Pomerania by the Teutonic Knights. After hearing twenty-five witnesses for the Polish side, the judges released a decision favorable to the King on 9 February 1321. According to that decision, the Teutonic Order had to return Pomerania to Poland, pay 30,000 grzywnas in compensation for the collection of income from Pomerania, and pay for the cost of the process. The Teutonic Knights did not expect that such a judgment would be surrendered and filed an appeal. Under the influence of the actions of the procurator of the Teutonic Order in the Papal Curia, the Pope did not approve of the judgment of Inowrocław and the case was suspended. This gave the Holy See the opportunity to use the conflict for their own purposes in the subsequent years.

===Alliances (1320)===
Władysław&#x27;s kingdom was now surrounded by three hostile forces: Brandenburg, the Teutonic Order, and the Luxembourg Kingdom of Bohemia. Looking for allies during the great European conflict between Pope John XXII and Ludwig Wittelsbach (Louis of Bavaria), Władysław the Short sided with the papal camp. Władysław&#x27;s alliance with the Charles I Robert, king of Hungary, was strengthened in 1320 by Charles I Robert&#x27;s marriage to Wladyslaw&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Łokietkówną.

===Expedition to Rus&#x27; and the war with Brandenburg (1323–1326)===
Three years later, the Polish-Hungarian alliance proved itself in Rus&#x27; Galicia. The last two princes descended from the dynasty of Rurik, Andrew of Galicia and Lev II of Galicia, were killed in battle. The allies decided to help the closest relative of the late princes—Bolesław George, the son of Trojden, Duke of Mazovia—in mastering the local throne. This effort led to increased Polish influence in Russia, which enabled the eventual takeover of the region by Wladyslaw&#x27;s son and successor, Casimir III the Great.

The Lithuanian Duke Gediminas became another ally of the King Wladyslaw in 1325. This alliance was supported by the marriage between Gediminas&#x27;s daughter Aldona (who adopted the baptismal name of Anna) and Władysław&#x27;s son Casimir.

In 1323, the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV gave his son Louis V the March of Brandenburg. Pope John XXII therefore summoned his supporters to not allow the assumption of the Ascanian inheritance by the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach. With Lithuanian support, Władysław invaded Brandenburg on 10 February 1326. He informed the Teutonic Knights about the participation of pagan armies in the expedition. He could, at least temporarily, count on their neutrality, since their truce was in force until the end of 1326. Approaching Brandenburg did not yield significant results, apart from some destruction, prisoners, and recovery of the castellany of Miedzyrzecz. This did not improve Władysław&#x27;s popularity in Germany, as it was perceived that the Polish king, together with heathens, initiated war with the Christian world. The papacy kept silent and did not support the Polish king, but it did not condemn him. The war with Brandenburg also alarmed the Silesian princes. In the same year, Władysław the Short regained the land of Wieluń from Bolesław the Elder, the Duke of Niemodlin.

===Failed attempt to master Mazovia (1327–1328)===
Władysław I Łokietek organized another armed expedition the following year. This time the target was the subordination of Wenceslaus, the duke of Płock. The expedition, despite the acquisition and burning of Płock, ended in failure, mainly because the Teutonic Order joined the war on the side of Wenceslaus, and soon after John of Bohemia, king of Bohemia, did likewise. Larger clashes with the opponents did not occur, but the King of Bohemia, taking advantage of military activity in Silesia, received a tribute from the princes of Upper Silesia in Opava in February 1327.

In connection with the outbreak of the Polish-Teutonic War in 1327 and the associated threat to border areas, possessions were exchanged between the king and his nephews. Between 28 May 1327 and 14 October 1328, Przemysł of Inowrocław gave Wladyslaw the Duchy of Inowrocław with Wyszogród and Bydgoszcz in exchange for the Duchy of Sieradz. And probably at the turn of 1327/1328, the sons of Siemowit of Dobrzyń—Władysław the Hunchback and Bolesław—exchanged the principality of Dobrzyń for the principality of Łęczyca.

===Loss of Dobrzyń (1329)===
In 1329 there was a resumption of warfare. John of Bohemia, with the help of the Teutonic Knights, took Dobrzyn, which he soon gave to his allies. Another loss was John&#x27;s successful coercion of Wenceslas of Plock to pay homage to him. And so the Duke of Plock refused to accept the sovereignty of the Polish monarch, and instead was dominated by a stranger. The Teutonic Knights, taking advantage of the fact that Kuyavia was not prepared for war, crossed the Vistula and burned and destroyed the bishoprics of Wloclawek, Raciąż, and Przedecz.

===The war with the Teutonic Knights in Kuyavia and the Battle of Płowce (1330–1332)===

In 1330 the Teutonic Knights resumed hostilities. Crusaders successfully plundered cities in Kuyavia and Greater Poland: Radziejów, Bydgoszcz, and Nakło. Only by a daring crossing of the Vistula River by Władysław and intrusion to Chełmno with the help of Lithuanians were the allies successful in besieging the castle of Kowalewo Pomorskie in September. Then, under the besieged castle of the Teutonic Knights in Lipienek, the king agreed to a seven-month truce on 18 October 1330. Unfortunately, during this trip the alliance with the Duke of Lithuania was compromised as a result of a personal quarrel between Władysław and Gediminas.

In 1331, there was another armed expedition by the Teutonic Knights into Polish lands. This time, according to the action plan of the Order, the troops under the command of Dietrich von Altenburg were to coordinate with the expedition of King John of Bohemia. The two armies were to meet under the walls of Kalisz. In the middle of the year, Teutonic troops carrying out a reconnaissance effort entered Kuyavia and Greater Poland, including taking Pyzdry (where there was a skirmish with the Polish troops) and Gniezno. The main expedition was organized in September 1331. While the Knights went to meet at Kalisz as agreed, upon arrival there were no Czech troops present. John of Bohemia had stopped in Silesia, where he effectively stopped the resistance of Bolko II of Świdnica and resolved the unsettled case of Głogów after the death of Duke Przemko II.

Unable to deliver a decisive blow to Władysław I Łokietek, the Knights decided on finally mastering Kuyavia. The night of 23–24 September saw the first major unresolved clash near Konin. Three days later, in the morning, Polish troops numbering about 5,000 and led personally by King Władysław and his son Prince Casimir encountered the rear guard of the Teutonic Knights near Radziejów. Taking advantage of the surprise, the Poles defeated the enemy unit and took Dietrich von Altenburg, the commander of the expedition, as prisoner. In the afternoon, however, there was another clash near the village of Płowce. The battle was not settled because of the withdrawal of some Polish troops with Prince Casimir, and in the confusion the Teutonic commander escaped from captivity. Though inconclusive, the Battle of Płowce was important psychologically for the Poles as it convinced them that the Knights were not insurmountable.

Soon after these events, peace negotiations were initiated in Inowrocław. However, this time it was not possible for Władysław to reach an agreement with the Teutonic Knights. In 1332, the Knights organized a big military expedition under the command of Otto von Luteberg. This time the Polish forces were too thin to face the resistance of the Knights in the open field. On 20 April, after a nearly two-week siege, Brześć, the capital of Kuyavia, fell. Soon the Teutonic Knights were also in the other main strongholds of province – Inowrocław and Gniewkowo, the latter of which was destroyed on the orders of the prince of the land, Casimir III of Gniewkowo.

The loss of Kuyavia, which was his patrimony, was certainly very painful for Władysław, although in the same year, taking advantage of the death of Przemko II of Głogow, he took Zbąszyń in Greater Poland by the river Obra, which had been held by the dukes of Głogow.

===Death===
Władysław the Elbow-high died on 2 March 1333 at the Wawel Castle in Kraków, where he was buried in the cathedral, perhaps on 12 March of that year. His son, Casimir III the Great, inherited Lesser Poland, the Duchy of Sandomierz, Greater Poland, Kuyavia, and the Duchies of Łęczyca and Sieradz. However, Silesia and Lubusz Land to the west, along with Gdańsk Pomerania, Western Pomerania, and Mazovia to the north, still remained outside the kingdom&#x27;s borders. Nevertheless, Władysław&#x27;s reign was a major step on the road to restoration of the Kingdom of Poland.

==Legacy and assessment of the ruler==
Władysław the Short persistently pursued the goal of his life, to unite Poland. He was not, however, entirely successful, and his achievements did not come easily. Furthermore, if not for the unexpected deaths of his many stronger opponents: Leszek the Black, Henry IV Probus, Casimir II of Łęczycka, Przemysl II of Greater Poland, Wenceslaus II, Wenceslaus III, and Henry III of Głogow, Władysław might have forever remained the prince of tiny Brześć-Kuyavia. But if not for the persistent and consistent actions of Władysław the Short, Poland could have become part of the Luxembourg monarchy or could have been permanently divided. It was during his reign that Poland seriously clashed for the first time with the Teutonic Order and established a surprising alliance with Lithuania that would ultimately last for centuries. With the coronation at Wawel, the King established a precedent and solidified the position of the Polish kingdom. Władysław also endeavored to establish a uniform legal code throughout the land. In this code he assured the safety and freedom of Jews and placed them on an equal footing with Christians. Finally, as he initiated the unification of the country he also began to organize a nationwide administration structure and treasury. This action was successfully continued by his son and successor, Casimir III the Great.

If not for the merits of his father, Casimir III would not have been able to have the threshold rule to pay the king of Bohemia and titular Polish king John of Bohemia the gigantic sum of 1.2 million Prague groschen to cede his rights to the Polish crown, or to speak with the biggest European rulers as equals, or develop an economically unified state. As in the case of Mieszko I and Boleslaw the Brave, the father lies in the shadow of his son and successor.

==Royal titles==
*Title before coronation: &quot;Wladislaus Dei gracia, dux Regni Poloniae et dominus Pomeraniae, Cuiavie, Lanciciae ac Siradiae&quot;
*:English translation: Vladislaus by the grace of God duke of the Kingdom of Poland, and lord of Pomerania, Kuyavia, Łęczyca and Sieradz
*Royal title after coronation: &quot;Wladislaus Dei gracia, rex Poloniae et dominus Pomeraniae, Cuiavie, Lanciciae ac Siradiae&quot;
*:English translation: Vladislaus by the grace of God king of Poland, and lord of Pomerania, Kuyavia, Łęczyca and Sieradz

Later histories refer to him also as Władysław IV or Władysław I. There are no records to show that he actually used any regnal number. Both numerals are retrospective assignments by later historians. &quot;IV&quot; comes from him being the fourth of that name to rule as overlord of the Polish, since Władysław I Herman. &quot;I&quot; comes from him having restored the monarchy after a fragmented era of a century or more, and also backwards-counting from Władysław of Varna who officially used the numeral III and Władysław Vasa who used the numeral IV.

==Family==

Władysław married Jadwiga of Kalisz, the daughter of Bolesław the Pious, Duke of Greater Poland, and Jolenta of Hungary. They had six known children.

*Kunigunde (born between 1295 and 1298; died 9 April 1331 or in 1333). Married first Bernard of Świdnica. Their children included Bolko II of Świdnica. Married secondly Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg.
*Stefan (born between 1296 and 1300; died 1306) – probably honoring Stefan V, uncle of Jadwiga, or possibly St. Stephen; nevertheless, this name indicates a Hungarian influence. He was buried in the Franciscan Church of Kraków.
*Władysław (born between 1296 and 1311; died 1312) – named after his father; he was buried, like Stefan, in the Franciscan Church of Kraków.
*Elizabeth (130529 December 1380) – the wife of Charles I Robert (1288–1342), King of Hungary (1308–1342).
*Casimir III the Great (30 April 13105 November 1370), King of Poland (1333–1370).
*Jadwiga (born between 1306 and 1309 or between 1311 and 1319; died 3 June between 1320 and 1335) – named after her mother. Otto the Merry (1301–1339), Duke of Austria (1330–1339), may have applied for her hand in marriage, perhaps in 1331.

==In popular culture==
He is played by Wiesław Wójcik in the Polish historical drama TV series &quot;Korona królów&quot; (The Crown of the Kings). He is a recurring character in the first season.

<text>An illuminated manuscript is a formally prepared document where the text is decorated with flourishes such as borders and miniature illustrations. Often used in the Roman Catholic Church for prayers and liturgical books such as psalters and courtly literature, the practice continued into secular texts from the 13th century onward and typically include proclamations, enrolled bills, laws, charters, inventories, and deeds.

The earliest surviving illuminated manuscripts are a small number from late antiquity, and date from between 400 and 600. Examples include the Vergilius Romanus, Vergilius Vaticanus, and the Rossano Gospels. The majority of extant manuscripts are from the Middle Ages, although many survive from the Renaissance. While Islamic manuscripts can also be called illuminated and use essentially the same techniques, comparable Far Eastern and Mesoamerican works are described as &quot;painted&quot;.

Most manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment until the 2nd century BCE, when a more refined material called vellum, made from stretched calf skin, was supposedly introduced by King Eumenes II of Pergamum. This gradually became the standard for luxury illuminated manuscripts, although modern scholars are often reluctant to distinguish between parchment and vellum, and the skins of various animals might be used. The pages were then normally bound into codices (singular: codex), that is the usual modern book format, although sometimes the older scroll format was used, for various reasons. A very few illuminated fragments also survive on papyrus. Books ranged in size from ones smaller than a modern paperback, such as the pocket gospel, to very large ones such as choirbooks for choirs to sing from, and &quot;Atlantic&quot; bibles, requiring more than one person to lift them.

Paper manuscripts appeared during the Late Middle Ages. The untypically early 11th century Missal of Silos is from Spain, near to Muslim paper manufacturing centres in Al-Andalus. Textual manuscripts on paper become increasingly common, but the more expensive parchment was mostly used for illuminated manuscripts until the end of the period. Very early printed books left spaces for red text, known as rubrics, miniature illustrations and illuminated initials, all of which would have been added later by hand. Drawings in the margins (known as marginalia) would also allow scribes to add their own notes, diagrams, translations, and even comic flourishes.

The introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. They are among the most common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.

==History==
=== Latin Europe ===
Art historians classify illuminated manuscripts into their historic periods and types, including (but not limited to) Late Antique, Insular, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance manuscripts. There are a few examples from later periods. Books that are heavily and richly illuminated are sometimes known as &quot;display books&quot; in church contexts, or &quot;luxury manuscripts&quot;, especially if secular works. In the first millennium, these were most likely to be Gospel Books, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells. The Book of Kells is the most widely recognized illuminated manuscript in the Anglosphere, and is famous for its insular designs. The Romanesque and Gothic periods saw the creation of many large illuminated complete bibles. The largest surviving example of these is The Codex Gigas in Sweden; it is so massive that it takes three librarians to lift it.

Other illuminated liturgical books appeared during and after the Romanesque period. These included psalters, which usually contained all 150 canonical psalms, and small, personal devotional books made for lay people known as books of hours that would separate one&#x27;s day into eight hours of devotion. These were often richly illuminated with miniatures, decorated initials and floral borders. They were costly and therefore only owned by wealthy patrons, often women.

As the production of manuscripts shifted from monasteries to the public sector during the High Middle Ages, illuminated books began to reflect secular interests. These included short stories, legends of the saints, tales of chivalry, mythological stories, and even accounts of criminal, social or miraculous occurrences. Some of these were also freely used by storytellers and itinerant actors to support their plays. One of the most popular secular texts of the time were bestiaries. These books contained illuminated depictions of various animals, both real and fictional, and often focused on their religious symbolism and significance, as it was a widespread belief in post-classical Europe that animals, and all other organisms on Earth, were manifestations of God. These manuscripts served as both devotional guidance and entertainment for the working class of the Middle Ages.

The Gothic period, which generally saw an increase in the production of illuminated books, also saw more secular works such as chronicles and works of literature illuminated. Wealthy people began to build up personal libraries; Philip the Bold probably had the largest personal library of his time in the mid-15th century, is estimated to have had about 600 illuminated manuscripts, whilst a number of his friends and relations had several dozen. Wealthy patrons, however, could have personal prayer books made especially for them, usually in the form of richly illuminated &quot;books of hours&quot;, which set down prayers appropriate for various times in the liturgical day. One of the best known examples is the extravagant for a French prince.
Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a commission from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the monks who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a scriptorium. Within the walls of a scriptorium were individualized areas where a monk could sit and work on a manuscript without being disturbed by his fellow brethren. If no scriptorium was available, then &quot;separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.&quot;

By the 14th century, the cloisters of monks writing in the scriptorium had almost fully given way to commercial urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands. While the process of creating an illuminated manuscript did not change, the move from monasteries to commercial settings was a radical step. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that monastic libraries began to employ secular scribes and illuminators. These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. Illuminators were often well known and acclaimed and many of their identities have survived.

=== Greek Europe and the Islamic world ===
The Byzantine world produced manuscripts in its own style, versions of which spread to other Orthodox and Eastern Christian areas. This distinct Byzantine style of illumination had a characteristic color palette along with different ways of preparing pigments and ink and a unique finish to the vellum writing surface which was not as conducive to long term preservation as the more texture Western style. With their traditions of literacy uninterrupted by the Middle Ages, the Muslim world, especially on the Iberian Peninsula, was instrumental in delivering ancient classic works to the growing intellectual circles and universities of Western Europe throughout the 12th century. Books were produced there in large numbers and on paper for the first time in Europe, and with them full treatises on the sciences, especially astrology and medicine where illumination was required to have profuse and accurate representations with the text.

The origins of the pictorial tradition of Arabic illustrated manuscripts are uncertain. The first known decorated manuscripts are some Qur&#x27;ans from the 9th century. They were not illustrated, but were &quot;illuminated&quot; with decorations of the frontispieces or headings. The tradition of illustrated manuscripts started with the Graeco-Arabic translation movement and the creation of scientific and technical treatises often based on Greek scientific knowledge, such as the Arabic versions of &quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot; (965 CE), &quot;De materia medica&quot; or &quot;Book of the Ten Treatises of the Eye&quot;. The translators were most often Arab Syriac Christians, such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq or Yahya ibn Adi, and their work is known to have been sponsored by local rulers, such as the Artuqids.

An explosion of artistic production in Arabic manuscripts occurred in the 12th and especially the 13th century. Thus various Syriac manuscripts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, such as Syriac Gospels, Vatican Library, Syr. 559 or Syriac Gospels, British Library, Add. 7170, were derived from the Byzantine tradition, yet stylistically have a lot in common with Islamic illustrated manuscripts such as the &quot;Maqāmāt al-Ḥarīrī&quot;, pointing to a common pictorial tradition that existed since circa 1180 in Syria and Iraq which was highly influenced by Byzantine art. Some of the illustrations of these manuscript have been characterized as &quot;illustration byzantine traitée à la manière arabe&quot; (&quot;Byzantine illustration treated in the Arab style&quot;).

The Persian miniature tradition mostly began in whole books, rather than single pages for muraqqas or albums, as later became more common. The Great Mongol Shahnameh, probably from the 1330s, is a very early manuscript of one of the most common works for grand illustrated books in Persian courts.

== Techniques ==
Styles and techniques of manuscript illumination varied by region, and there were distinct differences in aspects like color palette, decoration style, and peak periods of output. Certain places like the Celtic regions specialized in more ornamental details in contrast to the Byzantine pictorial designs, and regions such as Flanders were more prolific in manuscript production much later than other places.

Illumination was a complex and costly process, and was therefore usually reserved for special books such as altar bibles, or books for royalty. Heavily illuminated manuscripts are often called &quot;luxury manuscripts&quot; for this reason. In the early Middle Ages, most books were produced in monasteries, whether for their own use, for presentation, or for a commission. These monks would work as a collective group to sponsor the patronage of a manuscript, but that in turn shielded their identites somewhat from history: there are more numerous surviving signatures on works from the scibe and less from the illustrations, but often there is simply the signature of the patron monastery. However, commercial scriptoria grew up in large cities, especially Paris, and in Italy and the Netherlands, and by the late 14th century there was a significant industry producing manuscripts, including agents who would take long-distance commissions, with details of the heraldry of the buyer and the saints of personal interest to him (for the calendar of a book of hours). By the end of the period, many of the painters were women, especially painting the elaborate borders, and perhaps especially in Paris.
=== Text ===
The type of script depended on local customs and tastes. In England, for example, Textura was widely used from the 12th to 16th centuries, while a cursive hand known as Anglicana emerged around 1260 for business documents. In the Frankish Empire, Carolingian minuscule emerged under the vast educational program of Charlemagne.

The first step was to send the manuscript to a rubricator, &quot;who added (in red or other colors) the titles, headlines, the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator&quot;. These letters and notes would be applied using an ink-pot and either a sharpened quill feather or a reed pen. In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would &quot;undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe&#x27;s agent, but by the time the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator, there was no longer any scope for innovation.)&quot;

The sturdy Roman letters of the early Middle Ages gradually gave way to scripts such as Uncial and half-Uncial, especially in the British Isles, where distinctive scripts such as insular majuscule and insular minuscule developed. Stocky, richly textured blackletter was first seen around the 13th century and was particularly popular in the later Middle Ages. Prior to the days of such careful planning, &quot;A typical black-letter page of these Gothic years would show a page in which the lettering was cramped and crowded into a format dominated by huge ornamented capitals that descended from uncial forms or by illustrations&quot;. To prevent such poorly made manuscripts and illuminations from occurring, a script was typically supplied first, &quot;and blank spaces were left for the decoration. This presupposes very careful planning by the scribe even before he put pen to parchment.&quot;

=== Engrossing: The process of illumination ===

The following steps outline the detailed labor involved to create the illuminations of one page of a manuscript:
# Silverpoint drawing of the design is executed
# Burnished gold dots are applied
# Application of modulating colors
# Continuation of previous three steps in addition to outlining marginal figures
# Penning of a rinceau appearing in the border of page
# Finally, marginal figures are painted

The illumination and decoration was normally planned at the inception of the work, and space reserved for it. However, the text was usually written before illumination began. In the early medieval period the text and illumination were often done by the same people, normally monks, but by the High Middle Ages the roles were typically separated, except for routine initials and flourishes, and by at least the 14th century there were secular workshops producing manuscripts, and by the beginning of the 15th century these were producing most of the best work, and were commissioned even by monasteries. When the text was complete, the illustrator set to work. Complex designs were planned out beforehand, probably on wax tablets, the sketch pad of the era. The design was then traced or drawn onto the vellum (possibly with the aid of pinpricks or other markings, as in the case of the Lindisfarne Gospels). Many incomplete manuscripts survive from most periods, giving us a good idea of working methods.

At all times, most manuscripts did not have images in them. In the early Middle Ages, manuscripts tend to either be display books with very full illumination, or manuscripts for study with at most a few decorated initials and flourishes. By the Romanesque period many more manuscripts had decorated or historiated initials, and manuscripts essentially for study often contained some images, often not in color. This trend intensified in the Gothic period, when most manuscripts had at least decorative flourishes in places, and a much larger proportion had images of some sort. Display books of the Gothic period in particular had very elaborate decorated borders of foliate patterns, often with small drolleries. A Gothic page might contain several areas and types of decoration: a miniature in a frame, a historiated initial beginning a passage of text, and a border with drolleries. Often different artists worked on the different parts of the decoration.

Another feature of illuminating manuscripts of the Middle Ages was the use of Marginalia. These additions were typically found within and around decorative borders of the text. Marginalia found within medieval manuscripts were often unique special messages and details indicative of the precision and careful consideration involved in their production. Marginalia shaped the way the text was read and influenced the reader’s interaction with it. Placement of these decorations and messages prompted the reader to scrutinize beyond the physical book to interpret the text from multiple perspectives.

Marginalia ranged from intricate decorative illustrations to those considered extremely unusual. Some examples of marginalia found within medieval manuscripts included drawings of centaurs, snail and knight combat, warrior women, battles between cats and mice, parables from biblical texts, personified foxes, rabbits, and monkeys, and hidden words and messages buried within the border decorations. The added drawings and messages of the 13th to 14th centuries were typically devoted to recurring themes and often patterned after other types of popular medieval art such as stained-glass windows, stone carvings, and wall paintings.

=== Paints ===
While the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts, the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, &quot;the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom.&quot; There is evidence of illustratiors planning out color choice in advance, which indicates purposeful choice and design in the finished product. There is also a great deal of nuance when it comes to the colors and painting of manuscripts. Illuminators would be trained in color combinations and stylistic distinctions by a form of apprenticeship, so the limited number of primary literary sources discussing colors and techniques may not be accurate to what the actual illuminators learned and followed.

The medieval artist&#x27;s palette was broad:

=== Gilding ===

On the strictest definition, a manuscript is not considered &quot;illuminated&quot; unless one or many illuminations contained metal, normally gold leaf or shell gold paint, or at least was brushed with gold specks. Gold leaf was from the 12th century usually polished, a process known as &quot;burnishing&quot;. The inclusion of gold alludes to many different possibilities for the text. If the text is of religious nature, lettering in gold is a sign of exalting the text. In the early centuries of Christianity, Gospel manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold. The gold ground style, with all or most of the background in gold, was taken from Byzantine mosaics and icons. Aside from adding rich decoration to the text, scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold. Furthermore, gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of their riches. Eventually, the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent &quot;that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded&quot;. During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production. By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today.

The application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use gold leaf or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf, the pieces would be hammered and thinned. The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. There were several ways of applying gold to an illumination. One of the most popular included mixing the gold with stag&#x27;s glue and then &quot;pour it into water and dissolve it with your finger.&quot; Once the gold was soft and malleable in the water, it was ready to be applied to the page. Illuminators had to be very careful when applying gold leaf to the manuscript because gold leaf is able to &quot;adhere to any pigment which had already been laid, ruining the design, and secondly the action of burnishing it is vigorous and runs the risk of smudging any painting already around it.&quot;

== Patrons==
At least in earlier periods, monasteries were the biggest manufacturers of illuminated manuscripts. They produced manuscripts for their own use; heavily illuminated ones tended to be reserved for liturgical use in the early period, while the monastery library held plainer texts. In the early period manuscripts were often commissioned by rulers for their own personal use or as diplomatic gifts, and many old manuscripts continued to be given in this way, even into the Early Modern period. Especially after the book of hours became popular, wealthy individuals commissioned works as a sign of status within the community, sometimes including donor portraits or heraldry: &quot;In a scene from the New Testament, Christ would be shown larger than an apostle, who would be bigger than a mere bystander in the picture, while the humble donor of the painting or the artist himself might appear as a tiny figure in the corner.&quot; The calendar was also personalized, recording the feast days of local or family saints. 

By the end of the Middle Ages even many religious manuscripts were produced in secular commercial workshops, such as that of William de Brailes in 13th-century Oxford, for distribution through a network of agents, and blank spaces might be reserved for the appropriate heraldry to be added locally by the buyer. The growing genre of luxury illuminated manuscripts of secular works was very largely produced in commercial workshops, mostly in cities such as Paris, Ghent, Bruges and north Italy.

<text>Nils Gabriel Sefström (2 June 1787 – 30 November 1845) was a Swedish chemist. Sefström was a student of Berzelius and, when studying the brittleness of steel in 1830, he rediscovered a new chemical element, to which he gave the name vanadium.

Vanadium was first discovered by the Spanish-Mexican mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He named it erythronium. Friedrich Wöhler later confirmed that vanadium and erythronium were the same substance.

Sefström was member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1815. He was head teacher at the School of Mines at Falun from 1822 to 1838.

The Spitzbergen glacier Sefströmbreen, and the mountain ridge of Sefströmkammen, are named after him.

<text>Eastern Air Lines (also colloquially known as Eastern) was a major airline in the United States that operated from 1926 to 1991. Before its dissolution, it was headquartered at Miami International Airport in an unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Eastern was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; domestic airlines created by the Spoils Conferences of 1930, and was headed in its early years by World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker. It had a near monopoly in air travel between New York and Florida from the 1930s until the 1950s and dominated this market for decades afterward.

During airline deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, labor disputes and high debt loads strained the company under the leadership of former astronaut Frank Borman. Frank Lorenzo acquired Eastern in 1985 and moved many of its assets to his other airlines, including Continental Airlines and Texas Air Corporation. After continued labor disputes and a crippling strike in 1989, Eastern ran out of money and was liquidated in 1991.

American Airlines obtained many of Eastern&#x27;s routes from Miami International Airport to Latin America and the Caribbean. Delta Air Lines, Eastern&#x27;s main competitor at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, acquired many of Eastern&#x27;s Lockheed L-1011 TriStar aircraft. USAir acquired 11 of Eastern&#x27;s 25 Boeing 757-225 aircraft.

Eastern pioneered hourly air shuttle services between New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston in 1961 as the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle. It took over Braniff International&#x27;s South American routes following Braniff&#x27;s closure in 1982 and served London Gatwick in 1985 via its McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 &quot;Golden Wings&quot; service. Although Eastern announced on its March 2, 1986 timetable that it intended to initiate service to Madrid, effective May 1, 1986, it never commenced. The only scheduled transatlantic service Eastern provided was Miami to London Gatwick, commencing on July 15, 1985, and discontinuing the following year, in 1986, replaced with codeshare flights from Atlanta on British Caledonian Airways.

==History==
===Origins===
Eastern Air Lines was a composite of assorted air travel corporations, including Florida Airways and Pitcairn Aviation. In the late 1920s, Pitcairn Aviation won a contract to fly mail between New York City and Atlanta, Georgia on Mailwing single-engine aircraft. In 1929, Clement Keys, the owner of North American Aviation, purchased Pitcairn. In 1930, Keys changed the company&#x27;s name to &quot;Eastern Air Transport&quot;. After being purchased by General Motors and experiencing a change in leadership after the Airmail Act of 1934, the airline became known as Eastern Air Lines.

===Growth under Rickenbacker===

By 1937, Eastern&#x27;s route system stretched from New York to Washington, Atlanta, and New Orleans, and from Chicago to Miami. In the same year, it operated 20 daily flights and returns, every hour on the hour, between New York and Washington; the flight time was one hour, twenty minutes, one-way.

In 1938, World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker bought Eastern from General Motors. The complex deal was concluded when Rickenbacker together with Sidney Shannon presented Alfred P. Sloan with a certified check for .

Rickenbacker pushed Eastern into a period of growth and innovation; for a time Eastern was the most profitable airline in the post-war era, never needing state subsidy. In the late 1950s Eastern&#x27;s position was eroded by subsidies to rival airlines and the arrival of the jet age. On October 1, 1959, Rickenbacker&#x27;s position as CEO was taken over by Malcolm A. MacIntyre, a brilliant lawyer but a man inexperienced in airline operations.&#x27; Rickenbacker&#x27;s ouster was largely due to his reluctance to acquire expensive jets as he underestimated their appeal to the public. A new management team headed by Floyd D. Hall took over on 16 December 1963, and Rickenbacker left his position as director and chairman of the board on December 31, 1963, aged 73.

In 1956, Eastern bought Colonial Airlines, giving the airline its first routes to Canada.

===The Jet Age===

In November 1959, Eastern Air Lines opened its Chester L. Churchill-designed Terminal 1 at New York City&#x27;s Idlewild International Airport, later renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport. In 1960, Eastern&#x27;s first jets, Douglas DC-8-21s, started to take over the longer flights, like the non-stops from Chicago and New York City to Miami. The DC-8s were joined in 1962 by the Boeing 720 and in 1964 by the Boeing 727-100, which Eastern (along with American Airlines and United Airlines) had helped Boeing to develop. On February 1, 1964, Eastern was the first airline to fly the 727. Shortly after that, &quot;Captain Eddie&quot; Rickenbacker retired and a new image was adopted, which included the now famous &quot;hockey stick&quot; design, officially Caribbean Blue over Ionosphere Blue. Eastern was also the first US carrier to fly the Airbus A300 and the launch customer for the Boeing 757.

On April 30, 1961, Eastern inaugurated Eastern Air Lines Shuttle. Initially 95-seat Lockheed Constellation 1049s and 1049Cs left New York-LaGuardia every two hours, 8 am to 10 pm, to Washington National and to Boston. Flights soon became hourly, 7 am to 10 pm out of each city. No reservations or tickets were required; passengers could pay their fare in cash on board the flight. If a plane filled up at departure time, another plane was rolled out to carry any extra passengers.

Internationalization began as Eastern opened routes to markets such as Santo Domingo and Nassau, Bahamas. Services from San Juan, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport were expanded. In 1967, Eastern purchased Mackey Airlines, a small air carrier primarily operating in Florida and the Bahamas as part of this expansion. In 1973, Eastern purchased Caribair (Puerto Rico), a small airline based in Puerto Rico which operated McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets in the Caribbean.

Eastern bought the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and Airbus A300 widebody jets; the former would become known in the Caribbean as &quot;El Grandote&quot; (the huge one). Although Eastern had purchased four 747s, the delivery slots were sold to Trans World Airlines (TWA) when Eastern decided to purchase the L-1011.

Due to massive delays in the L-1011 program, mainly due to problems with the Rolls-Royce RB211 engines, Eastern leased two Boeing 747-100s from Pan Am between 1970 and 1972 and operated the aircraft between Chicago and San Juan as well as from New York to Miami and San Juan.

Just before Walt Disney World opened in 1971, Eastern became its &quot;official airline&quot;. It remained the official airline of Walt Disney World and sponsored a ride at the Magic Kingdom park (If You Had Wings in Tomorrowland where Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin is currently located) until its contracting route network forced Disney to switch to Delta shortly before Eastern&#x27;s 1989 bankruptcy filing.

The famous &quot;Wings of Man&quot; campaign in the late 1960s was created by advertising agency Young &amp; Rubicam, and restored Eastern&#x27;s tarnished image until the late 1970s, when former astronaut Frank Borman became president and it was replaced by a new campaign, &quot;We Have To Earn Our Wings Every Day&quot;. The new campaign, which featured Borman as a spokesperson, was used until the mid-to-late 1980s.

===Turmoil===

In 1975, Eastern was headquartered at 10 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan. After Frank Borman became president of Eastern Air Lines in late 1975, he moved Eastern&#x27;s headquarters from Rockefeller Center to Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Eastern&#x27;s massive Atlanta hub was in direct competition with Delta Air Lines, where the two carriers competed heavily to neither&#x27;s benefit. Delta&#x27;s less-unionized work force and slowly expanding international route network helped lead it through the turbulent period following deregulation in 1978.

In 1980, a Caribbean hub was started at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (known at the time as &quot;Isla Verde International Airport&quot;) near San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1982, Eastern acquired Braniff&#x27;s South American route network. By 1985, Eastern was the largest ATA airline in terms of passengers and operated in 26 countries on three continents.

During this era, Eastern&#x27;s fleet was split between their &quot;silver-colored hockey stick&quot; livery (the lack of paint reduced weight by 100 pounds) and their &quot;white-colored hockey stick&quot; livery (on its Airbus-manufactured planes, which required paint to cover the aircraft&#x27;s composite skin panels).

In 1983, Eastern became the launch customer of Boeing&#x27;s 757, which was ordered in 1978. Borman felt that its low cost of operation would make it an invaluable asset to the airline in the years to come. Lower oil prices failed to materialize and the debt created by this purchase coupled with the Airbus A300 purchases in 1977 contributed to the February 1986 sale to Frank Lorenzo&#x27;s Texas Air. At that time, Eastern was paying over $700,000 in interest each day before they sold a ticket, fueled, or boarded a single aircraft.

Starting about 1985, Eastern offered &quot;Moonlight Specials&quot;, with passenger seats on overnight flights scheduled for cargo from thirty freight companies. The flights, which operated between midnight and 7 am, served 18 cities in the United States connecting mainly to Houston (IAH). Eric Schmitt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the services were &quot;a hybrid of late-night, red-eye flights and the barebones People Express approach to service.&quot; The holds of the aircraft were reserved for cargo such as express mail, machine tool parts, and textiles. Because of this, the airline allowed each passenger to take up to two carry-on bags. The airline charged $10 for each checked bag, which was shipped standby. The airline charged between 50 cents and $3 for beverages and snacks. Bunny Duck, an Eastern flight attendant quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that the passengers on the special flights were &quot;a cross section of families, college kids, illegal aliens and weirdos from L.A.&quot;.

Eastern began losing money as it faced competition from no-frills airlines, such as People Express, which offered lower fares. In an attempt to differentiate itself from its bargain competitors, Eastern began a marketing campaign stressing its quality of service and its rank of highly experienced pilots.

==== Sale to Texas Air ====
Unable to keep up, Borman agreed to the sale of the airline in 1986 to Texas Air, led by Frank Lorenzo, which had already purchased Continental Airlines and lost a bidding war for TWA to Carl Icahn.

In February 1987, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a $9.5 million fine against Eastern Air Lines for safety violations, which was the largest fine assessed against an airline until American Airlines was fined $24.2 million in 2010. Eastern&#x27;s FAA violations all occurred prior to the acquisition by Texas Air.

In 1988, Phil Bakes, the president of Eastern Air Lines, announced plans to lay off 4,000 employees and eliminate and reduce service to airports in the Western United States; he said that the airline was going &quot;back to our roots&quot; in the East. At the time, Eastern was the largest corporate employer in the Miami area and remained so after the cuts. John Nordheimer wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Eastern&#x27;s prominence in the Miami area decreased as the city became a finance and trade center with a diversified local economy, instead of one based largely on tourism.

====Liquidation====
During Lorenzo&#x27;s tenure, Eastern was crippled by severe labor unrest that began long before the acquisition. Asked to accept deep cuts in pay and benefits, on March 4, 1989, Lorenzo locked out Eastern&#x27;s mechanics and ramp service employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Concerned that Lorenzo&#x27;s successful breaking of the IAM would do the same to the pilots&#x27; and flight attendants&#x27; unions, the pilots represented by Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and flight attendants represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) called a sympathy strike, which effectively shut down the airline&#x27;s domestic operations. Non-contract employees, including airport gate and ticket counter agents and reservation sales agents, could not honor the strike. Due to the lockout and sympathy strike, cancelled flights resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in revenue.

As a result of the strike, a weakened airline structure, high fuel prices, an inability to compete after deregulation and other financial problems, Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9, which allowed Eastern to continue operating on a smaller scale. Lorenzo initially sought a sale of the entire airline, and on April 6, Eastern agreed to be acquired by former Major League Baseball commissioner Peter Uberroth for $464 million. However, the transaction was terminated on April 12 after Lorenzo refused to give temporary control to a trustee. The sale process was then terminated on April 18, and Lorenzo proposed a sale of $1.8 million in assets that would allow the airline to continue operating independently.

In May 1989, Eastern sold its East Coast shuttle service to real estate mogul Donald Trump for $365 million. Trump continued operating the service as the Trump Shuttle. In August, Eastern signed a deal to sell sixteen DC-9 aircraft and gates in Philadelphia, Washington, and New York to Midway Airlines for $210 million. In May 1990, American Airlines acquired Eastern&#x27;s Latin American routes and related assets for $471 million.

After several failed attempts at obtaining creditor approval for restructuring plans, Lorenzo lost control of Eastern in April 1990, when former Continental president Martin Shugrue was appointed as trustee to manage Eastern&#x27;s reorganization. A report prepared by David Shapiro, an examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court overseeing Eastern&#x27;s bankruptcy filing, concluded that Eastern was shortchanged by Texas Air in numerous transactions between the two. For example, Texas Air bought assets like System One, a computer reservation operation, from Eastern at a price far below market value. Eastern tried to remain in business in an attempt to correct its cash flow, but to no avail.

Under bankruptcy, Eastern launched a &quot;100 Days&quot; advertising campaign, in which it promised to &quot;become a little bit better every day&quot;. The ads were conceived by advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather in New York, and started being broadcast on June 17, 1990 during the prime-time hours in 33 markets around the United States. The ads featured Martin Shugrue, the airline&#x27;s court-appointed trustee. While the campaign helped the company increase by 73% the number of bookings, it did not stop the company from going bankrupt.

Ultimately, Eastern Airlines stopped flying at midnight on Saturday, January 19, 1991. The previous evening, company agents, unaware of the decision, continued to take reservations and told callers that the airline was not closing. Following the announcement, 5,000 of the 18,000 employees immediately lost their jobs. Of the remaining employees, reservation agents were told to report to work at their regular times, while other employees were told not to report to work unless asked to do so. The Eastern shutdown eliminated many airline industry jobs in the Miami and New York City areas.

Later that month, Delta Air Lines acquired Eastern&#x27;s gates at Atlanta, and Northwest Airlines acquired Eastern&#x27;s gates at Washington National.

==Fleet==


Eastern Air Lines flew many different types of aircraft throughout its history.

==Eastern Express, Eastern Metro Express, Eastern Partner and Caribair==
Several regional and commuter airlines provided passenger feed for Eastern via code sharing agreements with their aircraft liveries reflecting the Eastern mainline paint scheme. There were a number of brandings including: Eastern Express, Eastern Atlantis Express, and Eastern Metro Express. LIAT, a Caribbean-based airline, also operated Eastern Partner service.

Eastern Express air carriers and their aircraft included:

*Air Midwest operating Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner (Metro II model) turboprops
*Atlantis Airlines operating British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner turboprops
*Bar Harbor Airlines operating ATR-42, Beechcraft 1900C, Beechcraft 99, and Saab 340A turboprops 
*Metro Airlines operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops
*Precision Airlines operating Dornier 228 turboprops
*Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA) operating Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft
*Sunaire (Aviation Associates), a division of Metro Airlines operating de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops

Eastern Atlantis Express was operated by Atlantis Airlines with BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft.

Eastern Metro Express was operated by Metro Airlines and was based at Eastern&#x27;s Atlanta (ATL) hub operating British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8 turboprops.

Eastern Partner was operated by a Caribbean-based airline, Leeward Islands Air Transport, with turboprop service between Eastern&#x27;s San Juan hub and Antigua, St. Kitts and St. Maarten.

Eastern also worked closely with another Caribbean-based airline, Caribair (Puerto Rico). The June 13, 1967 Eastern system timetable lists connecting flights operated by Caribair Convair 640 turboprops with service between Eastern&#x27;s San Juan hub and St. Croix and St. Thomas. By 1970, San Juan-based Caribair had become an all-jet airline operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 aircraft serving fourteen Caribbean islands as well as Miami with the air carrier subsequently being acquired by Eastern in 1973.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Fatal accidents===
* August 10, 1937, Trip 7, a Douglas DC-2 (NC13739), crashed on takeoff at Daytona Beach Municipal Airport after it struck a utility pylon during a nighttime take off, killing four of nine on board.
* February 26, 1941, Flight 21, a Douglas DST, crashed near Atlanta in fog due to a misread altimeter, almost killing Eddie Rickenbacker, who was traveling on airline business. His recovery in the hospital received broad press coverage; during his initial recovery, several incorrect news reports claimed that he had died. Of 16 on board, 8 died, including Congressman William D. Byron. Clara Savage Littledale, editor of &quot;Parents&quot; magazine, survived. Littledale recounted her experience of the crash for &quot;Parents&quot;. Her husband, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Harold A. Littledale, was paralyzed as a result of the crash.
* July 12, 1945: Flight 45, a Douglas DC-3-201C (NC25647) flying from Washington, DC to Columbia, SC, collided in mid-air with USAAF A-26C Invader near Florence, South Carolina. The A-26 lost control and crashed; two crew parachuted but only one survived. The DC-3 executed a forced landing in a cornfield, killing one passenger, a two-year-old boy.
* September 7, 1945: Flight 42, a Douglas DC-3-201G (NC33631), crashed near Florence, South Carolina following an unexplained fire in the rear of the aircraft. Control was lost after the right elevator also caught fire and the aircraft crashed in a swampy, wooded area, killing all 22 on board.
* December 30, 1945: Flight 14, a Douglas DC-3-201 (NC18123), overran the runway while landing at LaGuardia Airport after approaching too high and too fast, killing one of 14 of board.
* January 18, 1946: Flight 105, a Douglas DC-3-201E (NC19970), crashed at Cheshire, Connecticut after a loss of control caused by wing separation, killing all 17 on board. A fire, caused by a fuel leak, started in the left engine and spread to the wing, causing it to collapse and fail.
* January 12, 1947: Flight 665, a Douglas C-49 (NC88872), crashed at Galax, Virginia after the pilot deviated from the flight route, killing 18 of 19 on board.
* May 30, 1947: Flight 605, a Douglas DC-4 en route from Newark to Miami, crashed near Bainbridge, Maryland, killing all 53 aboard. At the time, Flight 605 was the deadliest crash in United States aviation history. &quot;Loss of control&quot; was cited as the reason for the crash.
* January 13, 1948: Flight 572, a Douglas DC-3-201F (NC28384), crashed at Oxon Hill, Maryland after striking trees while on approach to Washington National Airport, killing five of nine on board; the aircraft was flying too low.
* February 7, 1948: Flight 611, a Lockheed L-649 Constellation (NC112A), suffered a propeller blade separation over the Atlantic Ocean 156 mi off Brunswick, Georgia. Three hours after takeoff, the number three propeller failed and a portion of a blade penetrated the fuselage, cutting control cables, electrical wires and engine controls and killing a crew member before exiting the fuselage on the opposite side. After this the front portion of the number three engine broke free and fell off. A rapid descent was initiated. At 12,000 feet the descent was stopped. Due to instrument failure the aircraft descended visually to 1,000 feet. On landing the number four engine was shut down and the brakes applied hard, which blew out a tire. Fires started in the landing gear and number four engine but were quickly extinguished. Despite the damage, the aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
* November 1, 1949: Flight 537, a Douglas DC-4 (N88727) on approach to Washington National Airport, collided in mid-air with a Lockheed P-38 Lightning being test-flown for acceptance by the Government of Bolivia, killing all 55 aboard the DC-4 and seriously injuring the pilot of the P-38. At the time it was the deadliest airliner crash in United States history.
* October 19, 1953: A Lockheed L-749A Constellation (N119A) from Idlewild International Airport to San Juan, Puerto Rico, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing two of 27 on board.
* December 21, 1955: A Lockheed L-749A Constellation (N112A) crashed on approach to Jacksonville&#x27;s Imeson Airport arriving from Miami, with further scheduled stops at Washington, DC, New York and Boston. Twelve passengers and a crew of five were killed.
* October 4, 1960: Flight 375 (a Lockheed L-188 Electra) departing Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport for Philadelphia crashed on takeoff after striking a flock of birds. Sixty-two of the 72 passengers and crew were killed.
* November 30, 1962: Flight 512 (a Douglas DC-7) crashed during a go around after failing to land due to fog at Idlewild Airport (now JFK) in New York City. Of the 51 passengers and crew on board, 25 were killed.
* February 25, 1964: Flight 304 (a Douglas DC-8) flying from New Orleans International Airport to Washington-National Airport crashed into Lake Pontchartrain en route due to &quot;degradation of aircraft stability characteristics in turbulence, because of abnormal longitudinal trim component positions.&quot; All 51 passengers and seven crew aboard were killed.
* February 8, 1965: Flight 663, a Douglas DC-7 departing from New York City to Richmond, Virginia, crashed at Jones Beach State Park after takeoff from JFK when it was forced to evade inbound Pan Am Flight 212. All 84 on board died. The evasive action was blamed for causing the plane to lose control.
* December 4, 1965: Flight 853, a Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation, collided with TWA Flight 42, a Boeing 707, over Carmel, New York. The Constellation crashed on Hunt Mountain in North Salem, New York, killing four of 53 on board while the 707 landed safely with no casualties.
* December 29, 1972: Flight 401 (a brand new Lockheed L-1011) was preparing to land in Miami, when the flight crew became distracted by a non-functioning gear light. The flight crashed in the Everglades, killing 101 of 176 on board. This was the first major crash of a widebody jet aircraft.
* September 11, 1974: Flight 212, a Douglas DC-9-31 carrying 78 passengers and four crew, crashed while conducting an instrument approach in dense ground fog at Douglas Municipal Airport. The aircraft crashed just short of the runway, killing 72; three survivors subsequently died from their injuries. Killed on this flight were James, Peter, and Paul Colbert, the father and older brothers (respectively) of comedian Stephen Colbert.
* June 24, 1975: Flight 66, a Boeing 727, crashed into runway approach lights as it penetrated a thunderstorm near the ILS localizer course line at JFK in New York City, killing 113 passengers and crew. The official cause of the accident was a sudden high rate of descent, caused by severe downdrafts from the thunderstorm, and the continued use of the runway despite the hazardous weather. ABA basketball star Wendell Ladner was one of the passengers killed in the crash.
* January 1, 1985: Flight 980, a Boeing 727 struck Mount Illimani on a flight from Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in Asunción, Paraguay, to El Alto International Airport in La Paz, Bolivia. All 19 passengers and 10 crew were killed on impact.

===Non-fatal accidents and incidents===

* December 19, 1936: A Douglas DC-2-112 (NC13732) struck trees and crashed near Milford, Connecticut due to pilot error and radio problems; all 11 on board survived. The aircraft was leased from North American Aviation.
* October 18, 1938: A Douglas DC-2-112 (NC13735) had engine failure while taking off from Montgomery, Alabama. The engine caught fire and fell from the plane. The plane struck a tree upon landing in a field just a few miles from the airport. All 13 on board, including the crew of 3, survived with only the Captain, John David Hissong, sustaining minor burns.
* April 3, 1941: A Douglas DC-3-201B (NC21727) crashed into water off Vero Beach, Florida during a storm; although all 16 on board were injured, none were killed. The aircraft was written off.
* November 19, 1943: Trip 12, a Douglas DC-3-201E (NC19968), made an emergency landing at New Orleans en route from Houston after the pilot allowed the aircraft to descend too low during the second attempt to land. The number one propeller hit the water, causing portions of the engine and cowling to break off. All 15 on board survived. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
* October 11, 1946: Flight 546, a Douglas C-54B (NC88729), struck a ridge near Alexandria, Virginia while on approach to Washington National Airport; all 26 on board survived. During the approach, the aircraft had descended too low.
* December 19, 1946: Flight 605, a Douglas C-54B (NC88813) collided in mid-air with Universal Air Lines Flight 7, a Douglas C-47 (NC54374), near Aberdeen, Maryland. The C-47 departed Newark for Raleigh, while the C-54 departed Newark 15 minutes later for a non-stop flight to Miami. Near Aberdeen the C-54 flew past the C-47. The C-54 co-pilot saw the lights of an aircraft close and to the left of the C-54, which turned out to be the C-47. The C-54 pilot rolled into a right bank and forcefully pulled up the nose, causing the rear of the C-54 to strike the forward top portion of the C-47. The C-47 landed safely at Philips Army Air Field while the C-54 diverted to Washington. There were no casualties on either aircraft and both aircraft were repaired and returned to service.
* January 21, 1948: Flight 604, a Lockheed L-649 Constellation (NC111A), crashed into a snow bank while landing at Logan International Airport following a loss of control due to a snow-covered runway; all 25 on board survived.
* July 19, 1951: Flight 601, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation (N119A), suffered severe buffeting after an access door opened in flight. A flapless wheels-up landing was made at Curles Neck Farm, Virginia. The aircraft was later repaired and returned to service.
* November 27, 1951: Flight 167, a Douglas DC-3-201C (N25646) collided in mid-air with Civil Air Patrol Piper L-4J &quot;45-5151&quot; near Ocala, Florida. The Piper was climbing after a left turn when it struck the DC-3. The DC-3&#x27;s number one propeller made several cuts in the Piper&#x27;s left wing, causing a loss of control and the Piper crashed, killing the pilot. The DC-3 circled the airport for a few minutes before landing safely with no casualties.
* September 6, 1953: An L-1049 Super Constellation (N6214C) crashed on landing at McChord Air Force Base due to a hydraulic failure caused by engine problems; all 32 on board survived.
* May 8, 1954: Eastern Air Lines Flight 2634W made an emergency landing at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Edenton (now Northeastern Regional Airport)in Edenton, NC. All crew and passengers survived. This is according to a letter written by chairman of the board, Eddie Rickenbacker to Marine Air Base Squadron 14.
* February 17, 1956: Eastern Air Lines Flight 156 crashed near Owensboro, Kentucky, due to pilot error; all 23 on board survived. The aircraft stalled and crashed following an improperly executed final approach.
* March 10, 1957: A Martin 4-0-4 (N453A) crashed on landing at Standiford Field due to pilot error; all 34 on board survived. A portion of the left wing separated inboard of the number one engine due to excessive sink rate caused by the pilot&#x27;s landing approach technique.
* June 28, 1957: A Douglas DC-7B (N808D) had just returned from a training flight and was taxiing to the maintenance hangar at Miami International Airport when it collided with a parked Eastern Air Lines L-1049 Super Constellation (N6212C) near the hangar. Fuel leaked and both aircraft caught fire and burned out.
* March 17, 1958: A Martin 4-0-4 (N496A) (Flight # unknown) on final approach to Melbourne Municipal Airport in Melbourne, Florida, struck an unmarked pile of gravel at the approach end of the runway. During the landing roll the landing gear collapsed, and the aircraft caught fire and burned. All 10 occupants (3 crew, 7 passengers) evacuated safely.
* October 18, 1966: A Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation (N6219C) caught fire during refueling at Miami after a fuel line ruptured, causing substantial damage to the wing. The aircraft was written off, and broken up in June 1967.
* May 18, 1972: Flight 346, a Douglas DC-9-31 (N8961E) landed hard at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, collapsing the landing gear and breaking off the tail; all ten on board survived.
* November 27, 1973: Flight 300, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 inbound from Pittsburgh International Airport to Akron-Canton Airport landed too far down the runway, hydroplaned and went off the end of the runway and over an embankment in fog, low ceilings, light rain and 1.5 mile visibility. The aircraft was severely damaged and written off. All 26 on board (5 crew, 21 passengers) survived with various injuries.
* July 2, 1976: A Lockheed L-188 Electra (N5531) was blown up on the ground by a bomb at Logan International Airport.
* September 26, 1978: Eastern Air Lines Flight 75, an L-1011, overtook Air Caribbean Flight 309, a Beech 18, on approach to Isla Verde International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There were no injuries on the Eastern airplane, but all six occupants on the Air Caribbean plane were killed when it plummeted and crashed on to a local bar. Eastern Airlines and the FAA later settled with family members of the six dead people as well as injured bar clients, paying them almost $5,700,000 for damages.
* May 5, 1983: Flight 855, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, had all three engines shut down in flight. The pilot restarted one of the engines before returning to Miami International Airport. All 172 on board survived.
* April 21, 1984: Eastern Air Lines Flight 494, a DC-9, suffered an uncommanded deployment of reverse thrust during a flight from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to Piedmont Triad International Airport (GSO) in Greensboro, North Carolina, causing the aircraft to roll quickly to the right. The flight crew disabled the affected engine and returned safely to Atlanta. The pilots received the Air Line Pilots Association&#x27;s Superior Airmanship Award for their handling of the incident.
* September 15, 1987: Flight 216, a Boeing 727 (N8857E), was seriously damaged in a hard landing in severe winds at Tulsa International Airport; the 55 passengers and 7 crew were not injured. The aircraft was inspected by mechanics at the American Airlines Tulsa maintenance base and cleared to fly; it was then flown to Kansas City and Chicago with passengers, only to be removed from service after skin wrinkles in the fuselage were noticed. A senior American Airlines official later conceded that the Tulsa mechanics &quot;erred&quot; in their inspection.
* December 27, 1987: Flight 573, a Douglas DC-9-31 (N8948E), landed hard at Pensacola Regional Airport. The nose gear touched down first, and the aircraft bounced and touched down again, breaking the passenger cabin aft of the wings. The plane stopped with its tail resting on the runway but all 103 passengers and 4 crew survived.
* January 18, 1990: Eastern Air Lines Flight 111, a Boeing 727 (N8867E), collided with an Epps Air Service Beechcraft King Air upon landing at Atlanta-William B. Hartsfield International Airport, Georgia. The plane received substantial damage, but all 149 passengers and 8 crew members survived unharmed. The plane was later repaired. The King Air was destroyed, with the pilot killed and the first officer seriously injured.

===Hijackings===
* 24 July 1961: Flight 202, a Lockheed L-188 Electra, was hijacked to Cuba. A fighter plane from Homestead AFB followed the airliner until it reached Cuban airspace.
* September 20, 1968: Flight 950, a Boeing 720, was hijacked to Cuba.
* February 3, 1969: Flight 7 was hijacked to Cuba. The presence of Candid Camera host Allen Funt on the flight led many of the passengers to conclude that the hijacking was actually a prank. Funt and others were later released after 11 hours of captivity.
* March 17, 1970: Both pilots of Eastern Air Lines Shuttle Flight 1320, a DC-9-31 carrying 68 passengers and 5 crew, were shot by a deranged hijacker. The first officer was able to take the hijacker&#x27;s gun and shoot him three times before succumbing to his own wounds. Despite gunshot wounds in both arms, the captain was able to fight off the wounded hijacker and land the aircraft safely.

==New Eastern Air Lines==

In 2011, a group purchased the intellectual property, including trademarks, of Eastern Air Lines and formed the Eastern Air Lines Group. The group announced in early 2014 that it had filed an application with the United States Department of Transportation for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, which will be followed by certification with the Federal Aviation Administration. The new airline began service through charter and wet-lease flights out of Miami International in late 2014 with Boeing 737-800 jetliners painted in the classic Eastern &quot;hockey stick&quot; livery. The IATA and ICAO codes of the original airline, as well as its callsign, were used by the new iteration of Eastern Air Lines. After a sale to Swift Air, the trademarks were passed on to Eastern Airlines, LLC in 2018. On January 12, 2020, after nearly two decades of being officially defunct, the first flight of the renewed Eastern Airlines landed at JFK airport, heralding a new era for the brand name.

<text>Restoree (1967) is a science fiction novel by American-Irish writer Anne McCaffrey, her first book published. It is the story of a young woman who survives being abducted by aliens and finds a new life on another planet.

Betty Ballantine edited &quot;Restoree&quot; which initiated a long relationship between McCaffrey and Ballantine Books, and later its science fiction imprint Del Rey.

==Origin==
&quot;Restoree&quot; features &quot;an intelligent, survivor-type woman&quot; as a &quot;once-off jab at the way women were portrayed in science-fiction&quot;. While always reading about women cowering in a corner, awaiting rescue by the hero, McCaffrey objected that she would have been in the fighting herself.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Restoree&quot; is the story of Sara, an introverted, beak-nosed, 24-year-old virginal librarian originally from near Seaford, Delaware, who is abducted from New York City by the Mil, amorphous alien creatures that eat human flesh. She is kept alive, with her skin removed and in a catatonic state from the physical and mental shock, on a meat hook as a Mil meal until the alien ship she is on is captured by human inhabitants of the planet Lothar. Without her skin, some Lotharians mistake her for one of their own and perform controversial &quot;restoration&quot; procedures on her, including a nose job.

Sara comes to her senses in a mental institution on Lothar with no memory of what happened, little knowledge of the local language, and a beautiful, golden-skinned body. At the institution, she is treated as if she were retarded and given menial tasks to do, as are other &quot;restorees&quot; who have been clandestinely salvaged from Mil ships; it is apparently some factor of Sara&#x27;s Terran origins that allows her to fully recover from the shock of the Mil ordeal, while Lotharian restorees are of limited intellect at best. One of her jobs is to care for Harlan, the deposed planetary regent, who is being drugged into a moronic state. Recognizing what is being done, Sara helps Harlan to regain his senses and escape the mental institution. Sara and Harlan then gain the advantage over Harlan&#x27;s political enemies, defeat the Mil, solve some of Lothar&#x27;s emerging domestic problems and, of course, fall in love.

==Reception==
Mary T. Brizzi calls it &quot;unique among science fiction novels&quot;, with &quot;shallow histrionics of characterization&quot;, &quot;Harlequin Romance stereotypes&quot;, &quot;improbable reactions of heroes and villains alike&quot;, &quot;inconsistencies of plot&quot;, and a &quot;saccharine&quot; and &quot;melodramatic&quot; heroine — but emphasizes that, when &quot;read as parody&quot;, it is funny.

<doc id="92321" wikidata="Q1494806" url="?curid=92321" title="Nonsense verse">
<text>Nonsense verse is a form of nonsense literature usually employing strong prosodic elements like rhythm and rhyme. It is often whimsical and humorous in tone and employs some of the techniques of nonsense literature.

Limericks are probably the best known form of nonsense verse, although they tend nowadays to be used for straightforward humour, rather than having a nonsensical effect.

Among writers in English noted for nonsense verse are Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Mervyn Peake, Edward Gorey, Colin West, Dr. Seuss, and Spike Milligan. The Martian Poets and Ivor Cutler are considered by some to be in the nonsense tradition.

== Variants ==
In some cases, the humor of nonsense verse relies on the incompatibility of phrases which make grammatical sense but semantic nonsense – at least in certain interpretations – as in the traditional:

Compare .

Other nonsense verse makes use of nonsense words—words without a clear meaning or any meaning at all. Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear both made good use of this type of nonsense in some of their verse. These poems are well formed in terms of grammar and syntax, and each nonsense word is of a clear part of speech. The first verse of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; illustrates this nonsense technique, despite Humpty Dumpty&#x27;s later clear explanation of some of the unclear words within it:

Other nonsense verse uses muddled or ambiguous grammar as well as invented words, as in John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;The Faulty Bagnose&quot;:

Here, &quot;awoy&quot; fills the place of &quot;away&quot; in the expression &quot;far away&quot;, but also suggests the exclamation &quot;ahoy&quot;, suitable to a voyage. Likewise, &quot;worled&quot; and &quot;gurled&quot; suggest &quot;world&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; but have the &quot;-ed&quot; form of a past-tense verb. &quot;Somforbe&quot; could possibly be a noun, possibly a slurred verb phrase. In the sense that it is a slurred verb, it could be the word &quot;stumbled&quot;, as in Sam fell onto the drunk side and stumbled on a girl.

However, not all nonsense verse relies on word play. Some simply illustrate nonsensical situations. For instance, Edward Lear&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Jumblies&quot; has a comprehensible chorus:

However, the significance of the color of the heads and hands is not apparent and the verse appears to be nonsense.

Some nonsense verse simply presents contradictory or impossible scenarios in a matter-of-fact tone, like this example from Brian P. Cleary&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry&quot; (Millbrook Press, 2004):

Likewise, a poem sometimes attributed to Christopher Isherwood and first found in the anthology &quot;Poems Past and Present&quot; (Harold Dew, 1946 edition, J M Dent &amp; Sons, Canada – attributed to &quot;Anon&quot;) makes grammatical and semantic sense and yet lies so earnestly and absurdly that it qualifies as complete nonsense:

More contemporary examples of nonsense verse include the Vogon poetry from Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and the 1972 song &quot;Prisencolinensinainciusol&quot; by Italian multi-talent Adriano Celentano.

== Other languages ==

Russian nonsense poets include Daniil Kharms and Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, particularly his work under the pseudonym Kozma Prutkov, and some French exponents are Charles Cros and Robert Desnos. The best-known Dutch Nonsense poet is Cees Buddingh&#x27;. On Indian language Bengali Sukumar Roy is the pioneer of nonsense poems and is very famous for writing children&#x27;s literature. Abol Tabol is the best collection of nonsense verse in Bengali language.

Among German nonsense writers, Christian Morgenstern and Ringelnatz are the most widely known, and are both still popular, while Robert Gernhardt is a contemporary example. Morgenstern&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Das Nasobēm&quot;&quot; is an imaginary being like the Jabberwock, although less frightful:

The following observation by F.W. Bernstein has practically become a German proverb.
Julio Cortázar, the Argentine writer, was famous for playing with language in several works.

Besides the above, there is a special variation of Nonsense Verses called 颠倒歌 (upside down songs) in Chinese. They tend to make stuff happen the opposite way, for example:

<doc id="92324" wikidata="Q162170" url="?curid=92324" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">
<text>The Clifton Suspension Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Avon Gorge and the River Avon, linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset. Since opening in 1864, it has been a toll bridge, the income from which provides funds for its maintenance. The bridge is built to a design by William Henry Barlow and John Hawkshaw, based on an earlier design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It is a Grade I listed building and forms part of the B3129 road.

The idea of building a bridge across the Avon Gorge originated in 1753. Original plans were for a stone bridge and later iterations were for a wrought iron structure. In 1831, an attempt to build Brunel&#x27;s design was halted by the Bristol riots, and the revised version of his designs was built after his death and completed in 1864. Although similar in size and design, the bridge towers are not identical, the Clifton tower having side cut-outs, the Leigh tower more pointed arches atop a red sandstone-clad abutment. Roller-mounted &quot;saddles&quot; at the top of each tower allow movement of the three independent wrought iron eyebar chains on each side when loads pass over the bridge. The bridge deck is suspended by 162 vertical wrought-iron rods in 81 matching pairs.

The Clifton Bridge Company initially managed the bridge under licence from a charitable trust. The trust subsequently purchased the company shares, completing this in 1949 and took over the running of the bridge using the income from tolls to pay for maintenance. The bridge is a distinctive landmark, used as a symbol of Bristol on postcards, promotional materials, and informational web sites. It has been used as a backdrop to several films and television advertising and programmes. It has also been the venue for significant cultural events such as the first modern bungee jump in 1979, the last Concorde flight in 2003 which flew over the bridge, and a handover of the Olympic Torch relay in 2012.

==History==

===Plans===
It is unknown when the first bridge was constructed across the Avon in Bristol, but the first stone bridge, Bristol Bridge, was built in the 13th century. It had houses with shopfronts built on it to pay for its maintenance. A 17th-century illustration shows that these bridge houses were five storeys high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. In the 1760s a bill to replace the bridge was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. By the early 18th century, increase in traffic and the encroachment of shops on the roadway made the bridge fatally dangerous for many pedestrians. A new bridge, designed by James Bridges and finished by Thomas Paty was built in 1769 and 1776. Resentment at the tolls exacted to cross the new bridge occasioned the Bristol Bridge Riot of 1793. Other crossings were considered, but were restricted by Admiralty rules that stipulated that any bridge had to be at least above the water to allow the passage of tall-masted warships to Bristol Harbour. To achieve this, any bridge constructed between Bristol Bridge and Avon Gorge, from Hotwells to Ashton Gate, would require massive embankments and viaducts. The alternative was to build across the narrowest point of the Avon Gorge, well above the height required for shipping.
In 1753 Bristolian merchant William Vick had left a bequest in his will of £1,000 (equivalent to £ in ), invested with instructions that when the interest had accumulated to £10,000 (), it should be used for the purpose of building a stone bridge between Clifton Down (which was in Gloucestershire, outside the City of Bristol, until the 1830s) and Leigh Woods in Somerset. Although there was little development in the area before the late 18th century, as Bristol became more prosperous, Clifton became fashionable and more wealthy merchants moved to the area. In 1793 William Bridges published plans for a stone arch with abutments containing factories, which would pay for the upkeep of the bridge. The French Revolutionary Wars broke out soon after the design was published, affecting trade and commerce, so the plans were shelved. In 1811 Sarah Guppy patented a design for a suspension bridge across the gorge but this was never realised and was not submitted to the later competition.

By 1829, Vick&#x27;s bequest had reached £8,000, but it was estimated that a stone bridge would cost over ten times that. A competition was held to find a design for the bridge with a prize of 100 guineas. Entries were received from 22 designers, including Samuel Brown, James Meadows Rendel, William Tierney Clark and William Hazledine. Several were for stone bridges and had estimated costs of between £30,000 and £93,000. Brunel submitted four entries. The judging committee rejected 17 of the 22 plans submitted, on the grounds of appearance or cost. They then called in Scottish civil engineer Thomas Telford to make a final selection from the five remaining entries. Telford rejected all the remaining designs, arguing that was the maximum possible span. Telford was then asked to produce a design himself, which he did, proposing a suspension bridge, supported on tall Gothic towers, costing £52,000.

The Bridge Committee which had been set up to look at the designs sponsored the Clifton Bridge Bill which became an act, the Clifton Suspension Bridge Act 1830 (11 Geo. 4 &amp; 1 Will. 4. c. lxix), when the bill received royal assent on 29 May 1830. The act appointed three trustees to carry through the purposes of the act, with powers to appoint more up to a total not exceeding thirty five or less than twenty. The three trustees named in the act were the Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers, the Senior Sheriff of the City and County of Bristol and Thomas Daniel. The act allowed a wrought iron suspension bridge to be built instead of stone, and tolls levied to recoup the cost.

The three trustees named in the act met on 17 June 1830 and appointed further trustees, bringing the total up to 23. There were additions to this number in the weeks which followed, so by early July 1830 there were 31 in all, although not everyone had been formally sworn in by that date. Others included Thomas Durbin Brice, Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers, George Daubeny, John Cave, John Scandrett Harford, George Hilhouse, Henry Bush, and Richard Guppy.

The first full meeting of the trustees was held on 22 June 1830 in the Merchants Hall in Bristol. Alderman Thomas Daniel was in the chair. 86 people had committed £17,350, an average of just over £200 each.

These funds raised during the first few months of 1830 were not sufficient for the construction. Despite this Brunel produced a new proposal costing £10,000 less than Telford&#x27;s design and gained support for it in the local press. James Meadows Rendel, William Armstrong and William Hill also submitted new, cheaper proposals, complaining that the committee had not set a budget. In 1831 a second competition was held, with new judges including Davies Gilbert and John Seaward examining the engineering qualities of the proposals. Thirteen designs were submitted; Telford&#x27;s was the only one in which the chains achieved the weight per square inch required by the judges but it was rejected as being too expensive. The winner was declared to be a design by Smith and Hawkes of the Eagle Foundry in Birmingham. Brunel had a personal meeting with Gilbert and persuaded him to change the decision. The committee then declared Brunel the winner and he was awarded a contract as project engineer. The winning design was for a suspension bridge with fashionably Egyptian-influenced towers. In 2010, newly discovered letters and documents revealed that, in producing his design, Brunel had not taken advice from his father, Sir Marc Isambard Brunel, who had offered to help. The elder Brunel had recommended including a central support for the bridge, as he did not believe a single-span bridge of such length could be constructed. His son chose to ignore his advice.

===Construction===

A ceremony to mark the start of the construction works was held Monday 20 June 1831. Work started on blasting of St. Vincent&#x27;s Rock, on the Clifton side of the gorge. Four months later work was halted by the Bristol riots, which took place after the House of Lords rejected the second Reform Bill, which aimed to eliminate some of the rotten boroughs and give parliamentary seats to Britain&#x27;s fast growing industrial towns such as Bristol. Five to six hundred young men were involved in the riots and Brunel was sworn in as a special constable. The riots severely dented commercial confidence in Bristol; subscriptions to the bridge company ceased, and along with it, further construction of the bridge.
After the passing of the act for the Great Western Railway reestablished financial confidence, work resumed in 1836, but subsequent investment proved woefully inadequate. Despite the main contractors going bankrupt in 1837, the towers were built in unfinished stone. To enable the transfer of materials, a iron bar, which was in diameter, had been drawn by capstan across the gorge. A contract was placed with Dowlais Ironworks to supply 600 tons of bar iron, which was to be transported to the Copperhouse foundry to be forged into bar chains. By 1843 funds were exhausted and another £30,000 was needed. As the work had exceeded the time limit stated in the act, all work stopped. Brunel suggested building a deep water pier at Portbury, which would make the bridge an essential road link, but funds for this scheme were not forthcoming. In 1851, the ironwork was sold and used to build the Brunel-designed Royal Albert Bridge on the railway between Plymouth and Saltash. The towers remained and during the 1850s intrepid passengers could cross the gorge in a basket slung from the iron bar.
Brunel died in 1859, without seeing the completion of the bridge. His colleagues in the Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel&#x27;s Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished to make way for a new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.

A revised design was made by William Henry Barlow and Sir John Hawkshaw, with a wider, higher and sturdier deck than Brunel intended, with triple chains instead of double.
It has been argued that the size and technology of these revisions was so great that the credit for its design should go to Barlow and Hawkshaw. The towers remained in rough stone, rather than being finished in the Egyptian style.

Work on the bridge was restarted in 1862. Initially a temporary bridge was created by pulling ropes across the gorge and making a footway of wire ropes with wood planks held together with iron hoops. This was used by the workers to move a &quot;traveller&quot;, consisting of a light frame on wheels, to transport each link individually, which would eventually make up the chains supporting the bridge. The chains are anchored in tapering tunnels, long, on both sides of the bridge and plugs of Staffordshire blue brick infilled to prevent the chains being pulled out of the narrower tunnel mouth.

After completion of the chains, vertical suspension rods were hung from the links in the chains and large girders hung from these. The girders on either side then support the deck, which is higher at the Clifton end than at Leigh Woods so that it gives the impression of being horizontal. The strength of the structure was tested by spreading 500 tons of stone over the bridge. This caused it to sag by , but within the expected tolerances. During this time a tunnel was driven through the rocks on the Leigh Woods side beneath the bridge to carry the Bristol Port Railway to Avonmouth. The construction work was completed in 1864–111 years after a bridge at the site was first planned.

===Operation===

On 8 December 1864, the bridge was lit by a combination of four electric arc lamps, magnesium flares and limelights for its ceremonial opening ceremony. This was the earliest use of external electric lighting in Bristol. However, the lighting levels were inconsistent and the magnesium lamps were blown out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.

In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company was set up to oversee the final stages of completion and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick&#x27;s bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll is levied on vehicles, but the £0.05 toll that the act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected.Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.
In February 2012, the bridge trustees applied to the Department for Transport to increase the toll to £1, subsequently implemented on 24 April 2014.

On 1 April 1979, the first modern bungee jumps were made from the bridge by members of the University of Oxford Dangerous Sports Club. In 2003 and 2004, the weight of crowds travelling to and from the Ashton Court Festival and Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such great strain on the bridge that it was decided to close the bridge to all motor traffic and pedestrians during the events. The closure of the bridge for major annual events has continued each year since then.

On 26 November 2003, the last Concorde flight (Concorde 216) flew over the bridge before landing at Filton Aerodrome. In April 2006, the bridge was the centrepiece of the Brunel 200 weekend, celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. At the climax of the celebration a firework display was launched from the bridge. The celebrations also saw the activation of an LED-based lighting array to illuminate the bridge.

On 4 April 2009, the bridge was shut for one night to allow a crack in one of the support hangers to be repaired. On 23 May 2012, the London 2012 Olympic Torch relay crossed over the bridge, where two of the torchbearers came together in a &quot;kiss&quot; to exchange the flame in the middle of Brunel&#x27;s iconic landmark. The bridge carries four million vehicles per year, along part of the B3129 road. The bridge is a Grade I listed building.

In November 2011 it was announced that a new visitor centre, costing nearly £2 million, was to be built at the Leigh Woods end of the bridge to replace the temporary building currently being used. The new facilities were scheduled to be completed before the 150th anniversary of the opening, which was celebrated on 8 December 2014. In December 2012 it was announced that the bridge had received £595,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to improve the visitor centre.

==Archives==
The University of Bristol Special Collections holds substantial records related to the bridge. Letter books of the trustees of Clifton Suspension Bridge dated 1831–1862 are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 12167/42-44) (online catalogue).

==Engineering==

Although similar in size the bridge towers are not identical in design, the Clifton tower having side cut-outs whilst the Leigh tower has more pointed arches and chamfered edges. Brunel&#x27;s original plan proposed they be topped with then-fashionable sphinxes, but the ornaments were never constructed.

The Leigh Woods tower stands atop a red sandstone-clad abutment. In 2002 it was discovered that this was not a solid structure but contained 12 vaulted chambers up to high, linked by shafts and tunnels.

Roller-mounted &quot;saddles&quot; at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge. Though their total travel is minuscule, their ability to absorb forces created by chain deflection prevents damage to both tower and chain.

The bridge has three independent wrought iron chains per side, from which the bridge deck is suspended by eighty-one matching vertical wrought-iron rods ranging from at the ends to in the centre.
Composed of numerous parallel rows of eyebars connected by bolts, the chains are anchored in tunnels in the rocks below ground level at the sides of the gorge. The deck was originally laid with wooden planking, later covered with asphalt, which was renewed in 2009. The weight of the bridge, including chains, rods, girders and deck is approximately 1,500 tons.

==Incidents==
Two men were killed during the construction of the bridge. In 1885, a 22-year-old woman named Sarah Ann Henley survived a suicide attempt off the bridge when her billowing skirts acted as a parachute and she landed in the thick mud banks of the tidal River Avon at low tide; she subsequently lived into her eighties.

The Clifton Suspension Bridge is well known as a suicide bridge and is fitted with plaques that advertise the telephone number of Samaritans. Between 1974 and 1993, 127 people fell to their deaths from the bridge.
In 1998 suicide barriers were installed on the bridge to prevent people jumping. In the four years after installation this reduced the suicide rate from eight deaths per year to four.
Nicolette Powell, the wife of UK rhythm and blues singer Georgie Fame, formerly the Marchioness of Londonderry, jumped to her death from the bridge on 13 August 1993.

In 1957 a RAF Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron piloted by Flying officer John Greenwood Crossley flew under the deck while performing a victory roll before crashing in Leigh Woods, killing the pilot. The accident caused a landslip that led to the temporary closure of the nearby Portishead Railway. A helicopter from National Police Air Service Filton flew under the bridge during a search in 1997.

On 12 February 2014 the bridge was closed to traffic due to wind for the first time in living memory.

On 11 July 2024, there was a discovery of human remains on the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The bridge was closed to all traffic and all pedestrians during a manhunt that led to the arrest of a murder suspect.

<text>Paul John McGann ( ; born 14 November 1959) is an English actor. He came to prominence for portraying Percy Toplis in the television serial &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; (1986), then starred in the dark comedy &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987), which was a critical success and developed a cult following. McGann later became more widely known for portraying the eighth incarnation of the Doctor in the 1996 television film &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and its audio drama continuations. He is also known for playing Lieutenant William Bush in the TV series &quot;Hornblower&quot; (1998–2003).

==Early life==
Paul John McGann was born in Liverpool on 14 November 1959, into a Roman Catholic family. His ancestors immigrated from Ireland in the mid-19th century, having left due to the Great Famine. His mother, Clare, was a teacher, and his father Joe, a soldier on Gold Beach during D-Day, who died in 1984, was a metallurgist. His cousin, Ritchie Routledge, was in the 1960s band The Cryin&#x27; Shames. He has an older brother, Joe, and three younger siblings: brothers Mark and Stephen and sister Clare. All three of his brothers are also actors and the four of them played brothers in the 1995 TV serial &quot;The Hanging Gale&quot;. That same year, McGann also played Grigori Potemkin in the television film &quot;Catherine the Great&quot; alongside Mark and Stephen.

McGann attended Cardinal Allen Grammar School in the Liverpool suburb of West Derby. He was 17 and working in a shoe shop when he acted on the advice of one of his teachers and successfully auditioned for a place on the acting course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1980, the Principal of RADA, Hugh Cruttwell, selected a scene from an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which McGann co-wrote with Bruce Payne, to be performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II in one of her rare visits to the academy. Kenneth Branagh performed a soliloquy from &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the same event.

==Career==
===Early work and breakthrough===
McGann&#x27;s breakthrough role was in &quot;Give Us a Break&quot;, devised by Geoff McQueen, McGann played a good snooker player who got into scrapes with Robert Lindsay, who played his wideboy manager. The series was a comedy drama in the vein of the popular ITV series of the time, &quot;Minder&quot;. The series only lasted for one season and it was concluded by a one-off special. His first major dramatic role was the British World War I deserter and criminal Percy Toplis in the 1986 BBC serial &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot;. The film was based on the 1978 book of the same name, written by William Alison and John Fairley.

The serial garnered controversy from British right-wing media, though McGann&#x27;s performance garnered acclaim. In 1986, he was cast as the anonymous main character (Marwood) in Bruce Robinson&#x27;s cult film, &quot;Withnail and I&quot;. He also starred as Anton Skrebensky in Ken Russell&#x27;s 1989 adaptation of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot;. McGann&#x27;s other early film appearances include &quot;The Monk&quot;, &quot;Dealers&quot;, &quot;Tree of Hands&quot; and the epic war film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. McGann and other young British actors who were becoming established film actors such as Tim Roth, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth and Bruce Payne were dubbed the &#x27;Brit Pack&#x27;.

Since 1989, McGann has concentrated primarily on television work, including &quot;Nice Town&quot; and &quot;Nature Boy&quot; for the BBC, and &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; and the second series of &quot;Hornblower&quot; for ITV. However, he has had small roles in a number of high-profile American films like &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;Alien 3&quot;. His role in &quot;Alien 3&quot; was originally larger, but much of it was edited out of the final print. The cut footage can be seen in the extended version of the film.

In 1992, he was cast as Richard Sharpe, the lead character in the Sharpe series of made-for-TV films based on Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novels; however he injured his knee while playing football just days into filming &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot; in Ukraine. He was replaced by Sean Bean and the role effectively kick-started Bean&#x27;s career and is the one that he is most closely identified with.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
McGann played the eighth incarnation of the Doctor, in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 1996 television film. The television film also starred Eric Roberts, Daphne Ashbrook and featured the outgoing Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy. McGann&#x27;s brother, Mark McGann, also auditioned for the title role.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television film was a joint venture between the BBC, Universal Studios and the Fox Broadcasting Network. McGann had signed a contract to appear as the Eighth Doctor in a new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series, if Fox or Universal exercised their option. Thus, the television film was supposed to be a &quot;back door pilot&quot; in that, if it obtained respectable ratings, the new series would continue to be produced. The film was shown on 14 May 1996 in the US and on 27 May 1996 in the UK. Although it had 9.08 million viewers and was very successful in the UK, ratings were very low in the United States. As a consequence, Fox did not exercise its option to pick up the series and Universal could not find another network interested in airing a new &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series. Thus no new series was produced until 2005, after all the contractual rights had returned to the BBC.

McGann gave permission for his likeness to be used on the covers of the BBC&#x27;s Eighth Doctor novel and he has reprised the role of the Eighth Doctor in an extensive series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions. A number of these plays have also been broadcast on BBC Radio 7 (later BBC Radio 4 Extra).

After months of speculation, on 14 November 2013 (coincidentally McGann&#x27;s birthday), as part of the show&#x27;s 50th Anniversary celebrations, McGann finally reprised his role as the Eighth Doctor, in the mini-episode &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;. In this appearance his incarnation of the Doctor finally regenerates, 17 years after his first television appearance, into a previously unknown Doctor played by John Hurt. Additionally, McGann briefly appeared in the anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

He made his first appearance on the main television series in a cameo in the 2022 special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, alongside other past Doctors. He also featured in the documentary film &quot;Doctor Who Am I&quot;, supporting TV movie director Matthew Jacobs&#x27; embrace of the Doctor Who fandom and its conventions.

===Later career===
In the years following his appearance as the Doctor, McGann continued to diversify his acting portfolio with the television and film roles he accepted. In 1997 he appeared as a concerned father in the film &quot;&quot; and later that same year as Rob in &quot;Downtime&quot;, then in 1998 he appeared as Capt. Greville in &quot;The Dance of Shiva&quot;.

In the 2000s McGann&#x27;s film appearances began to increase with films like &quot;My Kingdom&quot; (2001), &quot;Listening&quot; (2003) and &quot;Gypo&quot; (2005). Perhaps his most iconic role since &quot;Doctor Who&quot; came in 2002, when McGann appeared in the film adaptation of the third story from Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. McGann played the part of David Talbot, a member of the secret organisation the Talamasca, which researches and investigates the supernatural. Talbot has appeared in many of Rice&#x27;s novels and has become a central character over the years. The film also starred Stuart Townsend, Marguerite Moreau and R&amp;B singer Aaliyah. McGann has also been in demand for voice-over work in Britain in recent years, particularly on television documentaries and commercials.

He also gained acclaim for his portrayal of William Bush in the final four instalments of the ITV/A&amp;E television series &quot;Hornblower&quot;, based on the Horatio Hornblower books by C.S. Forrester. He initially appears in the 2001 episode &quot;Mutiny&quot;, with Bush being the 2nd Lieutenant of HMS &quot;Renown&quot; (and Hornblower&#x27;s superior). In the 7th episode, &quot;Loyalty&quot;, he agrees to join Hornblower as his 1st Lieutenant when Hornblower takes command of HMS &quot;Hotspur&quot;. McGann again portrays Bush in the 2003 finale of the series, &quot;Duty&quot;.

In 2006, he appeared in the television drama &quot;Tripping Over&quot;. In 2007, McGann starred alongside Dervla Kirwan, Lorraine Ashbourne and David Bradley in BBC One drama &quot;True Dare Kiss&quot;, written by Debbie Horsfield. In 2010, McGann played a major role in a feature-length episode of long-running BBC mystery series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, as well as appearing as a regular in the crime drama &quot;Luther&quot;. In 2011, McGann played a major role as an Assistant Commissioner with something to hide in the final episode of &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; and also featured in Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;Butley&quot; alongside Dominic West at the Duchess Theatre in London.

In 2017, McGann joined the cast of the long-running BBC series &quot;Holby City&quot;, playing neurosurgeon John Gaskell. In 2021, he hosted the British Podcast Awards Gold-winning Noiser podcast production &quot;Real Dictators&quot;, a history show about the up to date facts on dictators of the past.

===Audio books and voice work===
McGann is also known for audiobook narration having read several Pat Barker and Bernard Cornwell novels. He narrated the abridged audiobook of Jeff Noon&#x27;s 1993 cyberpunk classic &quot;Vurt&quot;.

McGann continues to play the Eighth Doctor on audio. McGann&#x27;s first Big Finish audio play appearance was in 2001 in the story &quot;Storm Warning&quot;. It was through the Big Finish audio plays that McGann&#x27;s Doctor faced many classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; villains like the Daleks (in various different audio plays, the first of which being &quot;The Time of the Daleks&quot;) and the Cybermen (first encountered by the Eighth Doctor on audio in &quot;Sword of Orion&quot;).

Five Eighth Doctor dramas were broadcast in BBC 7&#x27;s &quot;The 7th Dimension&quot; slot between August 2005 and January 2006. They were in release order, starting with &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, although &quot;Minuet in Hell&quot; was judged unsuitable for the timeslot, and skipped. Two more Eighth Doctor audios, &quot;Shada&quot; and &quot;The Chimes of Midnight,&quot; were broadcast in December 2005 and January 2006. All six of these stories were rebroadcast on BBC7 beginning in July 2006. In 2007 and 2008, a series of audio plays starring McGann as the Eighth Doctor and Sheridan Smith as companion Lucie Miller was broadcast on BBC7.

His voice featured in the 1997 video game &quot;Ceremony of Innocence&quot;, together with those of Isabella Rossellini and Ben Kingsley.

After hearing him sing in &quot;The Monocled Mutineer,&quot; composer Bernard J. Taylor invited McGann to create the role of Benedict in the concept studio recording of the &quot;Much Ado&quot;, a musical based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.

McGann portrayed Ambassador Durian in &quot;The Minister of Chance&quot;, a fantasy audio drama released in six parts from 2011 to 2013. The series is a spin-off of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, but has no official connection to the franchise. In February 2014, a crowdfunded short film based on the first instalment of &quot;The Minister of Chance&quot; was released to those who had helped fund it.

McGann portrays antagonist Noah Shackleton in the audio drama adaptation of &quot;The Phoenix Files&quot;. The Australian production is the largest audio drama ever produced in Australia with a cast of 42 actors. McGann appears in all three instalments of the science-fiction dystopian thriller series.

McGann has done audio narration for BBC documentaries, including the 2014 BBC Scotland production, &quot;Apples, Pears and Paint: How to Make a Still Life Painting&quot;.

McGann is chief narrator in the popular &quot;A short history of…&quot; podcast series, which explores various historical topics in easily accessible episodes.

==Personal life==
In 1992, McGann married Annie Milner. They had two children: music producer Joseph and voice actor Jake.

Between 2006 and 2008, McGann was in a relationship with actress Susannah Harker.

<text>Eddie Campbell (born 10 August 1955) is a British comics artist and cartoonist. He was the illustrator and publisher of &quot;From Hell&quot; (written by Alan Moore), and the creator of the semi-autobiographical &quot;Alec&quot; stories collected in &quot;Alec: The Years Have Pants&quot;, and &quot;Bacchus&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Deadface&quot;), a wry adventure series about the few Greek gods who have survived to the present day.

His scratchy pen-and-ink style is influenced by the impressionists, illustrators of the age of &quot;liberated penmanship&quot; such as Phil May, Charles Dana Gibson, John Leech and George du Maurier, and cartoonists Milton Caniff and Frank Frazetta (particularly his &quot;Johnny Comet&quot; strip). Campbell&#x27;s writing has been compared to that of Jack Kerouac and Henry Miller.

Campbell has won almost every award the comics industry bestows, including the Eisner Award, the Harvey Award, the Ignatz Award, the Eagle Award, and the UK Comic Art Award.

==Biography==
===&quot;Alec&quot; and other autobiographical work===

Campbell made his earliest attempts at autobiographical comics in the late 1970s with &quot;In the Days of the Ace Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Club&quot; (1978–1979). This evolved into &quot;Alec&quot;, with the character of Alec MacGarry standing in for the author. Campbell self-published these early comics in the amateur press association &quot;BAPA&quot; and then as short-run photocopied pamphlets in London in the early 1980s, selling them at conventions and comic marts and via Paul Gravett&#x27;s &quot;Fast Fiction&quot; market stall. When Gravett founded &quot;Escape Magazine&quot;, Campbell was one of the artists featured.

In 1984 Escape published &quot;Alec&quot;, a slim collection of his semi-autobiographical stories. This was followed by two further collections, &quot;Love and Beerglasses&quot; (1985) and &quot;Doggie in the Window&quot; (1986).

While in Australia (where he moved in 1986), Campbell published a number of comics with the new British publisher Harrier Comics. These included the one-shots &quot;By The Time I Get To Wagga Wagga&quot; (1987), and &quot;Ace&quot; (1988), as well as his first &quot;Bacchus&quot; comics (see below). With Glenn Dakin and Phil Elliott, he helped found Harrier&#x27;s alternative-flavored New Wave imprint.

In 1990 all three &quot;Alec&quot; volumes were collected, together with some unpublished material, as &quot;The Complete Alec&quot; by Acme Press/Eclipse Comics. The collection won the 1991 UK Comic Art Award for Best Graphic Novel Collection. In 2000 this material was republished as &quot;The King Canute Crowd&quot;.

Two further slim volumes, &quot;The Dead Muse&quot; (1990) and &quot;Little Italy&quot; (1991) appeared through Fantagraphics Books.

&quot;Graffiti Kitchen&quot;, which Campbell considers the highpoint of the series, was published by Tundra in 1993, and &quot;The Dance of Lifey Death&quot; followed in 1994 from Dark Horse Comics.

Campbell then followed up these works by self-publishing two larger works. &quot;Alec: How To Be An Artist&quot; (2000), a study of the art form and of Campbell&#x27;s own artistic journey, and &quot;After The Snooter&quot; (2002), in which Campbell appears to have laid Alec McGarry to rest. Both works were originally serialised within his &quot;Bacchus&quot; series, but were reworked upon collection. &quot;The Fate of the Artist&quot;, in which Campbell&#x27;s family and friends investigate his disappearance, undermining the image of himself he had presented in his previous autobiographical works, was published by First Second Books in 2006. &quot;Alec: How to Be an Artist&quot; was nominated for the Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work in 2000.

In 2007 Campbell spent some time serving as a court illustrator in Australia.

All the &quot;Alec&quot; stories, with the exception of &quot;The Fate of the Artist&quot;, were published in one volume, &quot;Alec: The Years Have Pants&quot; by Top Shelf Productions in 2009 (). this was followed in 2012 by the publication of &quot;The Lovely Horrible Stuff&quot; (Top Shelf), a continuation of the autobiographical theme which playfully investigates our relationship with money.

===Bacchus===

The success of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; led to a short-lived explosion of black and white independent comics in the mid-1980s. Campbell joined in, creating the series &quot;Deadface&quot; for Harrier Comics, telling the story of Bacchus, god of wine and revelry, and the few other Greek mythological figures who have survived to the present day. Harrier published eight issues of &quot;Deadface&quot; and two issues of a companion comic, &quot;Bacchus&quot;. Campbell then began publishing short Bacchus stories in a number of anthologies, such as the British anthology &quot;Trident&quot; published by Trident Comics, and the American anthology &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; published by Dark Horse Comics. Dark Horse reprinted the Harrier series as &quot;Immortality Isn&#x27;t Forever&quot; in 1990 and a selection of the short stories as &quot;Doing the Islands With Bacchus&quot; in 1991. Campbell continued to produce Bacchus stories for Dark Horse until 1995 as a series of miniseries. The entire Bacchus saga is to be published in two 500-page volumes by Top Shelf Productions (Vol. 1 , Vol. 2 ).

===&quot;From Hell&quot;===

Beginning in 1989, Campbell illustrated Alan Moore&#x27;s ambitious Jack the Ripper graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot;, serialised initially in Steve Bissette&#x27;s horror anthology &quot;Taboo&quot;. Moore and Bissette chose Campbell as illustrator for his down-to-earth approach which gave the story a convincing realism and did not sensationalise the violence of the murders. After &quot;Taboo&quot; folded &quot;From Hell&quot; was published in instalments by Tundra and then Kitchen Sink Press, until the epilogue &quot;Dance of the Gull-catchers&quot; saw print in 1998.

===Self-publishing===
Under the influence of Dave Sim, Campbell founded Eddie Campbell Comics and began self-publishing in 1995, after the film rights to &quot;From Hell&quot; were optioned. The monthly series &quot;Bacchus&quot; reprinted and completed the story begun in &quot;Deadface&quot;, as well as carrying new and reprinted &quot;Alec&quot; stories. He went on to collect both &quot;Alec&quot; and &quot;Bacchus&quot; as a series of graphic novels. He also published the collected edition of &quot;From Hell&quot;, and comics adaptations of two of Alan Moore&#x27;s performance art pieces, &quot;The Birth Caul&quot; and &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;.

After the cancellation of &quot;Bacchus&quot;, Campbell published two issues of &quot;Eddie Campbell&#x27;s Egomania&quot; magazine, in which he began to serialise another work, &quot;The History of Humour&quot;. Facing an increasingly indifferent market for his work, and the collapse of his US distributor, Campbell ended his publishing imprint in 2003 after releasing the second issue of &quot;Egomania&quot;.

===First Second and Top Shelf===
After his self-publishing ceased, Campbell signed with First Second Books. As well as &quot;The Fate of the Artist&quot;, a continuation of the Alec series, First:Second published two other works by Campbell. June 2007 saw the publication of &quot;The Black Diamond Detective Agency&quot;, Campbell&#x27;s adaptation of an as-yet unmade screenplay by C. Gaby Mitchell. Set in the closing months of 1899, it features the eponymous private detective agency investigating a conspiracy to blow up a train, and their prime suspect&#x27;s efforts to find the truth.

In January 2008, First Second Books published Campbell&#x27;s collaboration with Dan Best, &quot;The Amazing Remarkable Monsieur Leotard&quot;. The work follows the life of circus performers and historical figures as they wander in and out of history. It was enthusiastically received by critics with &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; saying &quot;Something truly amazing and fun does indeed occur in this book.&quot;

Campbell&#x27;s next works were for Top Shelf. 2009 saw the publication of the life sized omnibus &quot;Alec: The Years Have Pants&quot;. The book collected Campbell&#x27;s Alec work to date with the exception of &quot;Fate of the Artist&quot;. the omnibus edition also included new material. In 2010 &quot;The Playwright&quot;, a collaboration with Daren White, was published. This reworked strips the pair had previously published in the Australian anthology &quot;Dee Vee&quot;, expanding the scope of the story-line and bringing it to conclusion.

In 2012 Top Shelf published &quot;The Lovely Horrible Stuff&quot; in collaboration with Knockabout Press, a continuation of Campbell&#x27;s autobiographical works. Campbell has evolved his art style, using colour, collage and photo-shop to create art which &quot;The Guardian&quot; describe as having &quot; a surreal, scruffy elegance&quot;.

===iPad===
A collection of the &quot;Dapper John&quot; stories originally created in the late 1970s, along with an original cover, a new interview and other features, was published as an iPad app in December 2011 by digital publisher Panel Nine. In 2012 Top Shelf released two collections of &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Bacchus&quot; series.

==Personal life==
Campbell moved to Brisbane, Australia in 1986 with his then-wife Annie where he lived for thirty years.

Campbell is married to author and artist Audrey Niffenegger and currently lives in Chicago. Campbell&#x27;s adult daughter Hayley Campbell (from his previous marriage) is a writer and radio journalist.

<text>Tczew (, formerly ) is a city on the Vistula River in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland, with 59,111 inhabitants (December 2021). It is the capital of Tczew County and the largest city of the ethnocultural region of Kociewie within the historic region of Pomerania.

Founded in the Middle Ages with city rights since 1260, Tczew was a major river port on the Vistula, and prospered as a major center for grain trade in Poland. The city is known for its Old Town with medieval Gothic churches, and the Vistula bridges, which played a key role in the Invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II. During the war, it was the location of a major German-operated transit camp for Poles expelled from the region, now home to the Vistula River Museum, the main museum devoted to the history of Poland&#x27;s longest river.

Tczew is the largest railroad junction in northern Poland, with railroads towards Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Warsaw and Chojnice, and a location for the electric machinery and food industries.

== Geographical location ==
Tczew is located on the west bank of river Vistula, approximately south of Gdańsk Bay at the Baltic Sea and south-east of Gdańsk.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Tczew (&quot;Trsow&quot;, &quot;Dersowe&quot;, ‘weaver&#x27;s town’) was first mentioned as &quot;Trsow&quot; in a document by Pomeranian Duke Grzymisław bestowing the land to the Knights Hospitaller in 1198. Around 1200 Sambor I, Duke of Pomerania, built a fortress here. In some documents, the name Derszewo appears, which stems from the name of a feudal lord, Dersław. It is unknown whether Trsow and Derszewo referred to the same or two neighboring settlements. In order to obtain better control of traffic on the Vistula, Pomeranian Duke Sambor II moved his residence from Lubiszewo Tczewskie to Tczew. By 1252 the settlement was known by the names &quot;Tczew&quot; and &quot;Dirschau&quot;.

In 1258 a city council was created and in 1260 Tczew was granted town rights. It is the only case in Poland for a city council to be established before granting city rights. Craft and trade developed, there was a port on the Vistula and a mint. Duke Mestwin II in 1289 brought the Dominican Order to the city. It was part of Poland until 1308. Following the Treaty of Soldin in 1309, Tczew was purchased from Brandenburg by Heinrich von Plötzke of the Teutonic Knights, despite the fact that the initial claims to the region by Brandenburg were of dubious legality. The townspeople were expelled by the Teutonic Knights and the town&#x27;s organization ceased to exist for more than half a century. It was rebuilt from 1364 to 1384, and was granted Kulm law by Winrich von Kniprode. After the Polish victory in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the town was briefly recaptured by Poland. In 1434 the town was burnt down by the Hussites. In 1440 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, opposing Teutonic Order&#x27;s rule. In 1457, during the Thirteen Years’ War, Bohemian mercenaries on the Order&#x27;s service sold Tczew to Poland in lieu of indemnities. The Second Peace of Thorn (1466) confirmed the reincorporation of Tczew to Poland. It became a county seat within the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the newly created Polish province of Royal Prussia, soon also part of the Greater Poland Province.

=== Modern era ===
During the Protestant Reformation most of the town&#x27;s inhabitants converted to Lutheranism. In 1626, it was occupied by king Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, who built a pontoon bridge across river Vistula and who had his camp at the southern side of the town. After the war Tczew was visited twice by Polish King Władysław IV Vasa, in 1634/1635 and 1636. Although it was rebuilt, it then suffered during the Polish-Swedish Wars. In a nearby battle on 2 September 1657, the Poles were defeated by the combined troops of Brandenburg and Sweden under general Josias II, Count of Waldeck-Wildungen.

The region was annexed from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Tczew, as Dirschau, became part of the newly founded Province of West Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars and the Polish national liberation fights the town was captured by Polish troops of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski in 1807, but became Prussian again in 1815. In 1818 Prussians closed down the Dominican monastery. In October and November 1831, some Polish infantry, cavalry and artillery units of the November Uprising stopped in the city on the way to their internment places, and later on, one of the insurgents&#x27; main escape routes from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the city.

With the unification of Germany, the town became part of the German Empire in 1871 and from 1887 was the capital of the Dirschau district in the province of West Prussia. The town grew rapidly during the 19th century after the opening of the Prussian Eastern Railway line connecting Berlin and Königsberg, with the Vistula bridge near Dirschau being an important part.

Under Prussian and German rule, the Polish population suffered from forced Germanization; for example Poles were denied Polish schools, and refused to teach their children German. The German official Heinrich Mettenmeyer wrote that German-appointed teachers were treated with the highest disdain by Polish children and their parents. The town remained a center of Polish resistance, and Poles established various organizations, including the &quot;Bank Ludowy&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Bank&quot;). According to the census of 1910, Dirschau had a population of 16,894, of which 15,492 (91.7%) were Germans and 1,397 (8.3%) were Poles. 

After Poland regained independence in 1918, local Poles formed the People&#x27;s Council in preparation for reintegration with Poland. After World War I as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, Tczew became part of the so-called &quot;Polish Corridor&quot; and was incorporated into the re-established Polish state. The official handover happened on January 10, 1920, and on January 30, Polish General Józef Haller arrived in the town with his troops. The town became a center of cultural activities of the German minority in Poland, a German-language school and a theater was founded. The regional member of the Polish Parliament represented the German minority. In this period, the proportion of Germans in the town decreased drastically from over 90% in 1910 to around 9% in 1939. In 1921, Tczew had a population of 16,250, of which 4,600 (28.3%) were Germans.

During the Interwar period, Tczew was famous for its maritime academy (&quot;Szkoła Morska&quot;) which later moved to Gdynia.

=== World War II ===

According to the city&#x27;s website, Tczew was the location of the start of World War II when German bombers attacked Polish sapper installations to prevent the bridges from being blown up at 04:34 on 1 September 1939 (the shelling of Westerplatte commenced at 04:45). The Germans sent two trains with soldiers to capture the bridges, disguised as freight trains, but due to Polish railroaders&#x27; intervention at Szymankowo, they came late, losing the element of surprise, and the bridges were blown up after 6 am that day.

During the German occupation of Poland (1939–45) Tczew, as &quot;Dirschau&quot;, was annexed into the newly formed province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia of Nazi Germany. The Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, repressions, expulsions and murder. The &quot;SS-Heimwehr-Sturmbann Götze&quot; entered the town in September 1939 to carry out actions against Poles, including mass arrests with the help of local Germans organized in the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot;, who denounced local Polish activists. The Germans imprisoned hundreds of Poles in camps established in a former factory (present-day museum), in a craft school and in military barracks. In November 1939, Germans carried out executions of numerous Poles from Tczew, including local teachers, officials (including pre-war mayor Karol Hempel,) craftsmen, a policeman, and even a seventeen-year-old student. Catholic priests from Pelplin, who were not murdered in Pelplin, were imprisoned in the Tczew barracks and then murdered in the Szpęgawski Forest (see also &quot;Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland&quot;). In January 1940, the SS and Selbstschutz carried out two public executions of 33 Polish residents, including railway employees, officials, craftsmen and merchants, at the market square. Also Poles from Starogard and Tuchola counties, who refused to sign the Volksliste, were imprisoned in Tczew and then murdered in a nearby forest. From 1939 to 1941, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; operated a penal forced labour camp in the town.

In 1941, the Germans created a transition camp for Poles expelled from the region in a local factory (present-day museum). People were held there for several weeks, and then expelled to the General Government. Hundreds of Polish inhabitants of Tczew were expelled in 1940 and 1941. Some inhabitants were also deported to forced labour to Germany. In 1943, local Poles managed to save some kidnapped Polish children from the Zamość region, by buying them from the Germans at the local train station.

After World War II the town, was one of the most damaged cities of Gdańsk Pomerania. Virtually none of its remaining factories were capable of production. There had been considerable loss of population down to around 18-20 thousand people. Shortly before the end of World War II it was occupied by the Soviet Army. After the end of war the town became part of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and renamed Tczew again. German residents were dispossessed and expelled; Polish residents took the first effort of reconstruction, and revitalization.

===Recent period===
From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Gdańsk Voivodeship. In 1984 the Museum of the Vistula River, a branch of the National Maritime Museum in Gdańsk, was opened in the building of the pre-war metal products factory, in which during World War II Germans operated a transit camp for Poles expelled from the region.

Currently, there are several companies in the electrical industry and machine building.

January 30, i.e. the date of Tczew&#x27;s return to Poland after the partition period, is celebrated as Tczew Day.

At the time, with its 837 metres’ length, it was one of the longest bridges in the world. Originally, the bridge had ten towers and two gateways – today only four towers remain. The other, railway bridge, was built between 1888 and 1890, when one bridge was no longer sufficient. On 1 September 1939 at 5:30AM, the bridges were destroyed by Polish sappers in order to prevent the German Army from accessing the city from the other side of the Vistula River.

<text>Pomeranian Voivodeship ( ; ) is a voivodeship, or province, in northwestern Poland. The provincial capital is Gdańsk.

The voivodeship was established on January 1, 1999, out of the former voivodeships of Gdańsk, Elbląg and Słupsk, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1997. It is bordered by the West Pomeranian Voivodeship to the west, Greater Poland and the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship to the south, the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship to the east, and the Baltic Sea to the north. It also shares a short land border with Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast), on the Vistula Spit. The bulk of the voivodeship is located in the historic region of Pomerania, with the territories on the eastern bank of the Vistula being part of Powiśle. The Pomeranian part of the region comprises most of Pomerelia (the easternmost part of Pomerania) with its subregions of Kashubia and Kociewie, whereas the western part, around Słupsk, is part of Farther Pomerania.

The province is one of rich cultural heritage. The Tricity urban area, consisting of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot, is one of the main cultural, commercial and educational centres of Poland. Gdańsk and Gdynia are two of the major Polish seaports, the first erected by Mieszko I of Poland in the Middle Ages, the latter built in the interwar period. Amongst the most recognisable landmarks of the region are the historic city centre of Gdańsk filled with Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque masterpieces, the Museum of the National Anthem in Będomin, located at the birthplace of Józef Wybicki, poet and politician, author of the national anthem of Poland, the largest medieval churches of Poland (the St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Gdańsk and the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in Pelplin) and the Malbork Castle. The voivodeship also includes the narrow Hel Peninsula and the Polish half of the Vistula Spit. Other tourist destinations include Wejherowo, Sopot, Jurata, Łeba, Władysławowo, Puck, Krynica Morska, Ustka, Jastarnia, Kuźnica, Bytów and many fishing ports, lighthouses, and marinas.

<text>Prostaglandins (PG) are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds called eicosanoids that have diverse hormone-like effects in animals. Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from the fatty acid arachidonic acid. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and of the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives.

The structural differences between prostaglandins account for their different biological activities. A given prostaglandin may have different and even opposite effects in different tissues in some cases. The ability of the same prostaglandin to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue is determined by the type of receptor to which the prostaglandin binds. They act as autocrine or paracrine factors with their target cells present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion. Prostaglandins differ from endocrine hormones in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body.

Prostaglandins are powerful, locally-acting vasodilators and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets. Through their role in vasodilation, prostaglandins are also involved in inflammation. They are synthesized in the walls of blood vessels and serve the physiological function of preventing needless clot formation, as well as regulating the contraction of smooth muscle tissue. Conversely, thromboxanes (produced by platelet cells) are vasoconstrictors and facilitate platelet aggregation. Their name comes from their role in clot formation (thrombosis).

Specific prostaglandins are named with a letter indicating the type of ring structure, followed by a number indicating the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon structure. For example, prostaglandin E1 has the abbreviation PGE1 and prostaglandin I2 has the abbreviation PGI2.

== History and name ==

Systematic studies of prostaglandins began in 1930, when Kurzrock and Lieb found that human seminal fluid caused either stimulation or relaxation of strips of isolated human uterus. They noted that uteri from patients who had gone through successful pregnancies responded to the fluid with relaxation, while uteri from sterile women responded with contraction. The name &quot;prostaglandin&quot; derives from the prostate gland, chosen when prostaglandin was first isolated from seminal fluid in 1935 by the Swedish physiologist Ulf von Euler, and independently by the Irish-English physiologist Maurice Walter Goldblatt (1895–1967). Prostaglandins were believed to be part of the prostatic secretions, and eventually were discovered to be produced by the seminal vesicles. Later, it was shown that many other tissues secrete prostaglandins and that they perform a variety of functions. The first total syntheses of prostaglandin F2α and prostaglandin E2 were reported by Elias James Corey in 1969, an achievement for which he was awarded the Japan Prize in 1989.

In 1971, it was determined that aspirin-like drugs could inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. The biochemists Sune K. Bergström, Bengt I. Samuelsson and John R. Vane jointly received the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research on prostaglandins.

== Biochemistry ==

=== Biosynthesis ===

Prostaglandins are found in most tissues and organs. They are produced by almost all nucleated cells. They are autocrine and paracrine lipid mediators that act upon platelets, endothelium, uterine and mast cells. They are synthesized in the cell from the fatty acid arachidonic acid.

Arachidonic acid is created from diacylglycerol via phospholipase-A2, then brought to either the cyclooxygenase pathway or the lipoxygenase pathway. The cyclooxygenase pathway produces thromboxane, prostacyclin and prostaglandin D, E and F. Alternatively, the lipoxygenase enzyme pathway is active in leukocytes and in macrophages and synthesizes leukotrienes.

=== Release of prostaglandins from the cell ===
Prostaglandins were originally believed to leave the cells via passive diffusion because of their high lipophilicity. The discovery of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of prostaglandin, demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of prostaglandin through the cellular membrane. The release of prostaglandin has now also been shown to be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily. Whether MRP4 is the only transporter releasing prostaglandins from the cells is still unclear.

==== Cyclooxygenases ====
Prostaglandins are produced following the sequential oxygenation of arachidonic acid, DGLA or EPA by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) and terminal prostaglandin synthases. The classic dogma is as follows:
* COX-1 is responsible for the baseline levels of prostaglandins.
* COX-2 produces prostaglandins through stimulation.

However, while COX-1 and COX-2 are both located in the blood vessels, stomach and the kidneys, prostaglandin levels are increased by COX-2 in scenarios of inflammation and growth.

==== Prostaglandin E synthase ====
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) — the most abundant prostaglandin — is generated from the action of prostaglandin E synthases on prostaglandin H2 (prostaglandin H2, PGH2). Several prostaglandin E synthases have been identified. To date, microsomal (named as misoprostol) prostaglandin E synthase-1 emerges as a key enzyme in the formation of PGE2.

==== Other terminal prostaglandin synthases ====
Terminal prostaglandin synthases have been identified that are responsible for the formation of other prostaglandins. For example, hematopoietic and lipocalin prostaglandin D synthases (hPGDS and lPGDS) are responsible for the formation of PGD2 from PGH2. Similarly, prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase (PGIS) converts PGH2 into PGI2. A thromboxane synthase (TxAS) has also been identified.
Prostaglandin-F synthase (PGFS) catalyzes the formation of 9α,11β-PGF2α,β from PGD2 and PGF2α from PGH2 in the presence of NADPH. This enzyme has recently been crystallized in complex with PGD2 and bimatoprost (a synthetic analogue of PGF2α).

== Functions ==
There are currently ten known prostaglandin receptors on various cell types. Prostaglandins ligate a sub-family of cell surface seven-transmembrane receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are termed DP1-2, EP1-4, FP, IP1-2, and TP, corresponding to the receptor that ligates the corresponding prostaglandin (e.g., DP1-2 receptors bind to PGD2).

The diversity of receptors means that prostaglandins act on an array of cells and have a wide variety of effects such as:
* create eicosanoids hormones
* act on thermoregulatory center of hypothalamus to produce fever
* increase mating behaviors in goldfish
* cause the uterus to contract
* prevent gastrointestinal tract from self-digesting, contributing to its mucosal defence in multifactorial way.

==Types== 
The following is a comparison of different types of prostaglandin, including prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin; PGI2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α).

== Role in pharmacology ==

===Inhibition===
Examples of prostaglandin antagonists are:
* NSAIDs (inhibit cyclooxygenase) and COX-2 selective inhibitors or coxibs
* Corticosteroids (inhibit phospholipase A2 production)
* Cyclopentenone prostaglandins may play a role in inhibiting inflammation
* Vitamin D3 and vitamin K2.

===Clinical uses===
Synthetic prostaglandins are used:
* To induce childbirth (parturition) or abortion (PGE2 or PGF2(misoprostol), with or without mifepristone, a progesterone antagonist)
** Induction of labour
* To prevent closure of ductus arteriosus in newborns with particular cyanotic heart defects (PGE1)
* As a vasodilator in severe Raynaud syndrome or ischemia of a limb
* In pulmonary hypertension
* In treatment of glaucoma (as in bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, a synthetic prostamide analog with ocular hypotensive activity) (PGF2α)
* To treat erectile dysfunction or in penile rehabilitation following surgery (PGE1 as alprostadil).
* To measure erect penis size in a clinical environment
* To treat egg binding in small birds

==Synthesis==
The original synthesis of prostaglandins F2α and E2 is shown below. It involves a Diels–Alder reaction which establishes the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core. 

== Prostaglandin stimulants ==
Cold exposure and IUDs may increase prostaglandin production.

<text>A multistatic radar system contains multiple spatially diverse monostatic radar or bistatic radar components with a shared area of coverage. An important distinction of systems based on these individual radar geometries is the added requirement for some level of data fusion to take place between component parts.
The spatial diversity afforded by multistatic systems allows different aspects of a target to be viewed simultaneously. The potential for information gain can give rise to a number of advantages over conventional systems.

Multistatic radar is often referred to as &quot;multisite&quot; or &quot;netted&quot; radar and is comparable with the idea of macrodiversity in communications. A further subset of multistatic radar with roots in communications is that of MIMO radar.

==Characteristics==
Since multistatic radar may contain both monostatic and bistatic components, the advantages and disadvantages of each radar arrangement will also apply to multistatic systems. A system with formula_1 transmitters and formula_2 receivers will contain formula_3 of these component pairs, each of which may involve a differing bistatic angle and target radar cross section. The following characteristics are unique to the multistatic arrangement, where multiple transmitter-receiver pairs are present:

===Detection===
Increased coverage in multistatic radar may be obtained via the spreading of the radar geometry throughout the surveillance area - such that targets might be more likely to be physically closer to transmitter receiver-pairs and thus attain a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

Spatial diversity may also be beneficial when combining information from multiple transmitter-receiver pairs which have a shared coverage. By weighting and integrating individual returns (such as through likelihood ratio based detectors), detection can be optimised to place more emphasis on stronger returns obtained from certain monostatic or bistatic radar cross section values, or from favourable propagation paths, when making a decision as to whether a target is present. This is analogous to the use of antenna diversity in an attempt to improve links in wireless communications.

This is useful where multipath or shadowing effects might otherwise lead to the potential for poor detection performance if only a single radar is used. One notable area of interest is in sea clutter, and how diversity in reflectivity and Doppler shift might prove beneficial for detection in a maritime environment.

Many stealth vehicles are designed to reflect radar energy away from expected radar sources in order to present as small a return to a monostatic system as possible. This leads to more energy being radiated in directions that are only available to multistatic receivers.

===Resolution===
Resolution may benefit from spatial diversity, due to the availability of multiple spatially diverse down-range profiles. Conventional radar typically has a much poorer cross-range resolution compared to down-range resolution, thus there is potential for gains through the intersection of constant bistatic range ellipses.

This involves a process of associating individual target detections to form a joint detection. Due to the un-cooperative nature of the targets, there is potential, if several targets are present, for ambiguities or &quot;ghost targets&quot; to be formed. These can be reduced through an increase in information (e.g. use of Doppler information, increase in down-range resolution or addition of further spatially diverse radars to the multistatic system).

===Classification===

Target features such as variation in the radar cross section or jet engine modulation may be observed by transmitter-receiver pairs within a multistatic system. The gain in information through observation of different aspects of a target may improve classification of the target. Most existing air defence systems utilize a series of networked monostatic radars, without making use of bistatic pairs within the system.

===Robustness===

Increased survivability and &quot;graceful degradation&quot; may result from the spatially distributed nature of multistatic radar. A fault in either transmitter or receiver for a monostatic or bistatic system will lead to a complete loss of radar functionality. From a tactical point of view, a single large transmitter will be easier to locate and destroy compared to several distributed transmitters. Likewise, it may be increasingly difficult to successfully focus jamming on multiple receivers compared to a single site.

=== Spatio-temporal synchronization ===

To deduce the range or velocity of a target relative to a multistatic system, knowledge of the spatial location of transmitters and receivers is required. A shared time and frequency standard also must be maintained if the receiver has no direct line of sight of the transmitter. As in bistatic radar, without this knowledge there would be inaccuracy in the information reported by the radar. For systems exploiting data fusion before detection, there is a need for accurate time and or phase synchronisation of the different receivers. For plot level fusion, time tagging using a standard GPS clock (or similar) is more than sufficient.

=== Communications bandwidth ===

The increase in information from the multiple monostatic or bistatic pairs in the multistatic system must be combined for benefits to be realised. This fusion process may range from the simple case of selecting plots from the receiver closest to a target (ignoring others), increasing in complexity to effectively beamforming through radio signal fusion. Dependent on this, a wide communications bandwidth may be required to pass the relevant data to a point where it can be fused.

=== Processing requirements ===

Data fusion will always mean an increase in processing compared to a single radar. However it may be particularly computationally expensive if significant processing is involved in data fusion, such as attempts to increase resolution.

==Examples of multistatic radar systems==
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Netted Radar System.
* Hamburg University of Technology’s Automotive Radar Network
* Jindalee Operational Radar Network
* EISCAT incoherent scatter radar
* Norwegian Defence Research Establishment’s Experimental Bi-Multistatic CW Radar
* SAIC’s Passive, Multi-Static Radar System
* University College London’s NetRad System
* Xidian University’s Coast-ship Bi/multistatic Ground-wave Over-the-horizon Radar
Several passive radar systems make use of multiple spatially diverse transmitters and hence may be considered to operate multistatically.

<text>Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1893 – October 26, 1952) was an African-American actress, singer-songwriter, and comedian. For her role as Mammy in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first African American to win an Oscar. She has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in 1975, and in 2006 became the first black Oscar winner honored with a U.S. postage stamp. In 2010, she was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In addition to acting, McDaniel recorded 16 blues sides between 1926 and 1929 and was a radio performer and television personality; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. Although she appeared in more than 300 films, she received on-screen credits for only 83. Her best known other major films are &quot;Alice Adams&quot;, &quot;In This Our Life&quot;, &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;, and &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

McDaniel experienced racism and racial segregation throughout her career, and as a result, she was unable to attend the premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in Atlanta because it was held in a whites-only theater. At the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles, she sat at a segregated table at the side of the room. In 1952, McDaniel died of breast cancer. Her final wish, to be buried in Hollywood Cemetery, was denied because at the time of her death, the graveyard was reserved for whites only.

==Early life and education==
McDaniel, the youngest of 13 children, was born in 1893 to formerly enslaved parents in Wichita, Kansas. Her mother, Susan Holbert, was a singer of gospel music, and her father, Henry McDaniel, fought in the Civil War with the 122nd United States Colored Troops.

In 1901, the family moved to Fort Collins, Colorado where McDaniel lived with her parents and three siblings in a house at 317 Cherry Street. She attended Franklin School. McDaniel&#x27;s father Henry preached and sang at church. Local historians successfully appealed to have a plaque installed on the front of the house to recognize it as a historically significant location. The family did not live a long time in the city. They moved to Denver, Colorado. Hattie attended Denver East High School from 1908 to 1910. In 1910, she won a gold medal for reciting &quot;Convict Joe&quot;, a Pre-Prohibition-era poem about the evils of alcohol, for a Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union contest.

Her brother, Sam McDaniel, played the butler in the 1948 Three Stooges&#x27; short film &quot;Heavenly Daze&quot;. Her sister Etta McDaniel was also an actress.

==Career==
===Early career===
McDaniel was a songwriter and performer.She also married her first husband, Howard Hickman. They lived for a short time at 32 Meade Street in Denver, until he died of pneumonia in 1915.She honed her songwriting skills while working with her brother Otis McDaniel&#x27;s carnival company, a minstrel show. McDaniel and her sister Etta Goff launched the McDaniel Sisters Company, an all-female minstrel show in 1914. After the death of her brother Otis in November 1916, Hattie and Etta performed to full capacity crowds as The McDaniel Sisters and Their Merry Minstrel Maids in April and May 1917.

From 1920 to 1925, she appeared with Professor George Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Melody Hounds&quot;, a Black touring ensemble. In the mid-1920s, she embarked on a radio career, singing with the Melody Hounds on station KOA in Denver. From 1926 to 1929, she recorded many of her songs for Okeh Records and Paramount Records in Chicago. McDaniel recorded two sides during a session with Hartzell &quot;Tiny&quot; Parham in the summer of 1926 for the Meritt label in Kansas City, Missouri.

After the stock market crashed in 1929, McDaniel could only find work as a washroom attendant at Sam Pick&#x27;s &quot;Club Madrid&quot; near Milwaukee. Despite the owner&#x27;s reluctance to let her perform, she was eventually allowed to take the stage and soon became a regular performer.

In 1931, McDaniel moved to Los Angeles, where she joined her brother Sam, and sisters Etta and Orlena. When she could not get film work, she took jobs as a maid and laundress. Sam was working on a KNX radio program, &quot;The Optimistic Do-Nut Hour&quot;, and was able to get his sister a spot. She performed on radio as &quot;Hi-Hat Hattie&quot;, a bossy maid who often &quot;forgets her place&quot;. Her show became popular, but her salary was so low that she had to keep working as a maid. She made her first film appearance in &quot;The Golden West&quot; (1932), in which she played a house servant or mammy. Her second appearance came in the highly successful Mae West film &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1933), in which she had a significant part. In 1934, McDaniel joined the Screen Actors Guild. She began to attract attention and landed larger film roles, which began to win her screen credits. Fox Film Corporation put her under contract to appear in &quot;The Little Colonel&quot; (1935), with Shirley Temple, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore.

&quot;Judge Priest&quot; (1934), directed by John Ford and starring Will Rogers, was the first film in which she played a major role. She had a leading part in the film and demonstrated her singing talent, including a duet with Rogers. Rogers helped guide McDaniel&#x27;s performance. In 1935, McDaniel had prominent roles, as a slovenly maid in &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (RKO Pictures); a comic part as Jean Harlow&#x27;s maid and traveling companion in &quot;China Seas&quot; (MGM) (also starring Clark Gable); and as the maid Isabella in &quot;Murder by Television&quot;, with Béla Lugosi. She appeared in the 1938 film &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot;, starring James Stewart and Ginger Rogers. McDaniel had a featured role as Queenie in the 1936 film &quot;Show Boat&quot; (Universal Pictures), starring Allan Jones and Irene Dunne, in which she sang a verse of &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot; and she and Robeson sang &quot;I Still Suits Me&quot;. After &quot;Show Boat&quot;, she had major roles in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Saratoga&quot; (1937), starring Jean Harlow and Clark Gable; &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot; (1938), with Margaret Sullavan; and &quot;The Mad Miss Manton&quot; (1938), starring Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. She had a minor role in &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1937), in which she played the &quot;jilted wife&quot;.

McDaniel was a friend of many of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular stars, including Joan Crawford, Tallulah Bankhead, Bette Davis, Shirley Temple, Henry Fonda, Ronald Reagan, Olivia de Havilland, and Clark Gable. 

She starred with de Havilland and Gable in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). Around this time, she was criticized by members of the Black community for the roles she accepted and for pursuing roles aggressively in the Hollywood system, instead of rocking the Hollywood boat by raising Black awareness. For example, in &quot;The Little Colonel&quot; (1935), the film reflected abusive and also romanticized stereotypes of slave and slaveowners roles in the Old South, something that McDaniel had to endure throughout her career. Her portrayal of Malena in RKO Pictures&#x27; &quot;Alice Adams&quot; was unique how Malena interacted with the Adams family. McDaniel&#x27;s performance was described by reviewers as hilarious and highly comedic. Author Alvin Marill said of McDaniel&#x27;s performance, &quot;The highlight of the film—indeed one of the best-remembered moments in films of that era—is the dinner party, &#x27;stolen&#x27; by Hattie McDaniel as the slatternly maid, Malena. She grumbles over the menu, battles balky dining room doors, fights a flopping maid&#x27;s cap, chews gum, and shuffles her way through a series of unappetizing courses.&quot;

===&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;===
The competition to win the part of Mammy in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was almost as fierce as that for Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to film producer David O. Selznick to ask that her own maid, Elizabeth McDuffie, be given the part. McDaniel did not think she would be chosen, because she had earned her reputation as a comic actress. One source claimed that Clark Gable recommended that the role be given to McDaniel; in any case, she went to her audition dressed in an authentic maid&#x27;s uniform and won the part.

Loew&#x27;s Grand Theater on Peachtree Street in Atlanta was selected by the studio as the site for the Friday, December 15, 1939, premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Studio head David O. Selznick asked that McDaniel be permitted to attend, but MGM advised him not to, because of Georgia&#x27;s segregation laws. Clark Gable threatened to boycott the Atlanta premiere unless McDaniel were allowed to attend, but McDaniel convinced him to attend anyway.

Most of Atlanta&#x27;s 300,000 citizens crowded the route of the seven-mile (11 km) motorcade that carried the film&#x27;s other stars and executives from the airport to the Georgian Terrace Hotel, where they stayed. While Jim Crow laws kept McDaniel from the Atlanta premiere, she did attend the film&#x27;s Hollywood debut on December 28, 1939. Upon Selznick&#x27;s insistence, her picture was also featured prominently in the program.

====Reception and 1939 Academy Awards====
For her performance as the house servant who repeatedly scolds her owner&#x27;s daughter, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara (Vivien Leigh), and scoffs at Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), McDaniel won the 1939 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Black actor to have been nominated and win an Oscar. &quot;I loved Mammy&quot;, McDaniel said when speaking to the white press about the character. &quot;I think I understood her because my own grandmother worked on a plantation not unlike Tara&quot;. Her role in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; had alarmed some whites in the South; there were complaints that in the film she had been too &quot;familiar&quot; with her white owners.

At least one writer pointed out that McDaniel&#x27;s character did not significantly depart from Mammy&#x27;s persona in Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s novel, and that in both the film and the book, the much younger Scarlett speaks to Mammy in ways that would be deemed inappropriate for a Southern teenager of that era to speak to a much older white person, and that neither the book nor the film hints of the existence of Mammy&#x27;s own children (dead or alive), her own family (dead or alive), a real name, or her desires to have anything other than a life at Tara, serving on a slave plantation. Moreover, while Mammy scolds the younger Scarlett, she never crosses Mrs. O&#x27;Hara, the more senior white woman in the household. Some critics felt that McDaniel not only accepted the roles but also in her statements to the press acquiesced to Hollywood&#x27;s stereotypes, providing fuel for critics of those who were fighting for Black civil rights. Later, when McDaniel tried to take her &quot;Mammy&quot; character on a road show, Black audiences did not prove receptive.

While many Black people were happy over McDaniel&#x27;s personal victory, they also viewed it as bittersweet. They believed &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; celebrated the slave system and condemned the forces that destroyed it. For them, the unique accolade McDaniel had won suggested that only those who did not protest Hollywood&#x27;s systemic use of racial stereotypes could find work and success there.

A review in The Times noted that McDaniel &quot;almost acts everybody else off the screen when she is allowed to appear in the foreground.&quot;

The 12th Academy Awards took place at Coconut Grove Restaurant of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. It was preceded by a banquet in the same room. Louella Parsons, an American gossip columnist, reported about Oscar night, writing on February 29, 1940:

McDaniel received a plaque-style Oscar, approximately by , the type awarded to all Best Supporting Actors and Actresses at that time. She and her escort were required to sit at a segregated table for two at the far wall of the room; her white agent, William Meiklejohn, sat at the same table. The hotel had a strict no-Blacks policy, but allowed McDaniel in as a favor. The discrimination continued after the award ceremony as well; her white co-stars went to a &quot;no-Blacks&quot; club, where McDaniel was also denied entry. No other Black woman won an Oscar again for 50 years until Whoopi Goldberg won Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Ghost&quot;. Weeks prior to McDaniel winning her Oscar, there was even more controversy. David Selznick, the producer of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, omitted the faces of all the Black actors on the posters advertising the movie in the South. None of the Black cast members were allowed to attend the premiere for the film.

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; won eight Academy Awards. It was later named by the American Film Institute (AFI) as number four among the top 100 American films of all time in the 1998 ranking and number six in the 2007 ranking.

===Additional work===

In the Warner Bros. film &quot;In This Our Life&quot; (1942), starring Bette Davis and directed by John Huston, McDaniel once again played a domestic, but one who confronts racial issues when her son, a law student, is wrongly accused of manslaughter. It may have been &quot;one of the most significant black female roles of the era&quot;. McDaniel was in the same studio&#x27;s &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; (1943), with Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis. In its review of the film, &quot;Time&quot; wrote that McDaniel was comic relief in an otherwise &quot;grim study&quot;, writing, &quot;Hattie McDaniel, whose bubbling, blaring good humor more than redeems the roaring bad taste of a Harlem number called Ice Cold Katie&quot;. McDaniel continued to play maids during the war years for Warners in &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1942) and United Artists&#x27; &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944). She did not use &quot;old-style black Hollywood dialect&quot;, and wore a stylish coat and hat, but the film&#x27;s message was that &quot;black Americans really still preferred to work for white people in menial capacities even if it meant earning a significantly smaller salary and giving up a large amount of independence.&quot; She also appeared as a maid in &quot;Janie&quot; (1944) and played the role of &quot;Aunt Tempe&quot;, a maid in &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946) for Disney. 

She made her last film appearances in &quot;Mickey&quot; (1948) and &quot;Family Honeymoon&quot; (1949), where that same year, she appeared on the live CBS television program &quot;The Ed Wynn Show&quot;. She remained active on radio and television in her final years, becoming the first black actor to star in her own radio show with the comedy series &quot;Beulah&quot;. She also starred in the television version of the show, replacing Ethel Waters after the first season. (Waters had apparently expressed concerns over stereotypes in the role.) &quot;Beulah&quot; was a hit, and earned McDaniel $2,000 per week (equal to $ today), however, the show was controversial. In 1951, the United States Army ceased broadcasting &quot;Beulah&quot; in Asia because troops complained that the show perpetuated negative stereotypes of black men as shiftless and lazy and interfered with the ability of black troops to perform their mission. In the late 1940s, her health declined. McDaniel learned she had breast cancer. Too ill to work, she was replaced by Louise Beavers.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
McDaniel married Howard Hickman on January 19, 1911, in Denver, Colorado. He died on March 3, 1915. She married her second husband, George Langford, in 1922. He died of a gunshot wound a little while after they were married.

She married James Lloyd Crawford, a real estate salesman, on March 21, 1941, in Tucson, Arizona. In his book &quot;Bright Boulevards, Bold Dreams&quot;, Donald Bogle describes McDaniel as happily confiding to gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in 1945 that she was pregnant. McDaniel began buying baby clothes and set up a nursery in her house. Her plans were shattered when she suffered a false pregnancy and fell into a depression. She never had any children. She divorced Crawford in 1945, after four and a half years of marriage. Crawford had been jealous of her career success, she said.

She married Larry Williams, an interior decorator, on June 11, 1949, in Yuma, Arizona, but divorced him in 1950 after testifying that their five months together had been marred by &quot;arguing and fussing&quot;. McDaniel broke down in tears when she testified that her husband tried to provoke dissension in the cast of her radio show and otherwise interfered with her work. &quot;I haven&#x27;t gotten over it yet&quot;, she said. &quot;I got so I couldn&#x27;t sleep. I couldn&#x27;t concentrate on my lines&quot;.

===Community service===

During World War II, she served as chairman of the Negro Division of the Hollywood Victory Committee, providing entertainment for soldiers stationed at military bases. The U.S. military was segregated, but black entertainers were not yet allowed to serve on white entertainment committees. She elicited the help of a friend, the actor Leigh Whipper, and other black entertainers for her committee. She made numerous personal appearances at military hospitals, threw parties, and performed at United Service Organizations (USO) shows and war bond rallies to raise funds to support the war on behalf of the Victory Committee. McDaniel was also a member of American Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services.

She joined actor Clarence Muse, one of the first black members of the Screen Actors Guild, in an NBC radio broadcast to raise funds for Red Cross relief programs for Americans that had been displaced by devastating floods, and she gained a reputation for generosity, lending money to friends and strangers alike.

When her Los Angeles neighbors in the Sugar Hill area tried to have black families evicted from their homes by suing to have race restrictive covenants enforced, McDaniel took a lead role. She held meetings at her home, organizing around 30 black residents in order to fight the suit in court.

Hattie McDaniel was an honorary member of Sigma Gamma Rho and its branch in Los Angeles.

==Death==
On August 26, 1951, McDaniel suffered a stroke, complicated by diabetes and a heart ailment, and was admitted to the Temple Hospital in Los Angeles.

She died of breast cancer on October 26, 1952, in the hospital of the Motion Picture House in the San Fernando Valley. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Three thousand mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements.

McDaniel wished to be buried in Hollywood Cemetery, which upheld a policy of racial segregation at the time and refused to inter her; she was buried instead in Rosedale Cemetery (the first cemetery in Los Angeles open to all races and creeds).

In 1999, Hollywood Cemetery offered to have McDaniel re-interred there, but after her family declined the offer the cemetery erected a cenotaph, now one of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, overlooking its lake.

McDaniel&#x27;s last will and testament of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, where she had been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed.

Despite evidence McDaniel earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than $10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than $11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in a glass case in the university&#x27;s drama department. It appears to have gone missing from Howard in the 1960s or 1970s, however, and it was never recovered.

On September 26, 2023, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it would replace McDaniel&#x27;s Oscar, returning it to Howard University in a ceremony which was held on October 1, 2023.

==Reception and impact==
===African American politics===
As her fame grew, McDaniel faced growing criticism from some members of the black community. Groups such as the NAACP complained that Hollywood stereotypes not only restricted black actors to servant roles but often portrayed them as lazy, dim-witted, satisfied with lowly positions, or violent. In addition to addressing the studios, they called upon actors, and especially leading black actors, to pressure studios to offer more substantive roles and at least not pander to stereotypes. They also argued that these portrayals were unfair as well as inaccurate and that, coupled with segregation and other forms of discrimination, such stereotypes were making it difficult for all black people, not only actors, to overcome racism and succeed in the entertainment industry. Some attacked McDaniel for being an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, a person willing to advance personally by perpetuating racial stereotypes or being an agreeable agent of offensive racial restrictions. McDaniel characterized these challenges as class-based biases against domestics, a claim that white columnists seemed to accept. She reportedly said, &quot;Why should I complain about making $700 a week playing a maid? If I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be making $7 a week being one&quot;.

Unlike many other black entertainers, she was not associated with civil rights protests and was largely absent from efforts to establish a commercial base for independent black films. She did not join the Negro Actors Guild of America until 1947, late in her career. McDaniel hired one of the few white agents who would represent black actors at the time, William Meiklejohn, to advance her career. Her avoidance of political controversy was deliberate. When columnist Hedda Hopper sent her Richard Nixon placards and asked McDaniel to distribute them, McDaniel declined, replying she had long ago decided to stay out of politics. &quot;Beulah is everybody&#x27;s friend&quot;, she said. Since she was earning a living honestly, she added, she should not be criticized for accepting such work as was offered. Her critics, especially Walter White of the NAACP, claimed that she and other actors who agreed to portray stereotypes were not a neutral force but rather willing agents of black oppression.

McDaniel and other black actresses and actors feared that their roles would evaporate if the NAACP and other Hollywood critics complained too loudly. She blamed these critics for hindering her career and sought the help of allies of doubtful reputation. After speaking with McDaniel, Hopper claimed that McDaniel&#x27;s career troubles were not the result of racism but had been caused by McDaniel&#x27;s &quot;own people&quot;.

===Achievements and legacy===

McDaniel has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood: one at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to radio and one at 1719 Vine Street for motion pictures. In 1975, she was inducted posthumously into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.

In 1994, actress and singer Karla Burns, the first black performer to win a Laurence Olivier Award, launched her one-woman show &quot;Hi-Hat-Hattie&quot; (written by Larry Parr), about McDaniel&#x27;s life. Burns went on to perform the role in several other cities through 2018, including Off-Broadway and the Long Beach Playhouse Studio Theatre in California.

In 2002, McDaniel&#x27;s legacy was celebrated in American Movie Classics&#x27;s (AMC) film &quot;Beyond Tara, The Extraordinary Life of Hattie McDaniel&quot; (2001), produced and directed by Madison D. Lacy and hosted by Whoopi Goldberg. This one-hour special depicted McDaniel&#x27;s struggles and triumphs in the presence of rampant racism and brutal adversity. The film won the 2001–2002 Daytime Emmy Award, presented on May 17, 2002, for Outstanding Special Class Special.

McDaniel was the 29th inductee in the &quot;Black Heritage&quot; Series by the United States Postal Service. Her 39-cent stamp was released on January 29, 2006, featuring a 1941 photograph of McDaniel in the dress she wore to accept the Academy Award in 1940. The ceremony took place at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where the Hattie McDaniel collection includes photographs of McDaniel and other family members as well as scripts and other documents.

In 2004 Rita Dove, the first black U.S. poet laureate, published her poem &quot;Hattie McDaniel Arrives at the Coconut Grove&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and has since presented it frequently during her poetry readings as well as on YouTube.

In 2010, Mo&#x27;Nique, the winner of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in &quot;Precious&quot;, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel &quot;for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to&quot;.

In the 2020 Netflix mini-series &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a fictionalized Hattie McDaniel is played by Queen Latifah.

ReShonda Tate Billingsley&#x27;s historical novel about McDaniel, &quot;The Queen of Sugar Hill: A Novel of Hattie McDaniel&quot;, was released in March 2024.

On October 26 2024, the anniversary of McDaniel&#x27;s death, the first full length film about her life, &quot;The Dichotomy of Hattie McDaniel,&quot; produced by Houston Theater and media company Vincent Victoria Presents&quot;,&quot; premiered in Houston, Texas.The Dichotomy of Hattie Mc Daniel was the opening film at the 2025 SanDiego Black Film Festival and won for Best Drama, Best Director for Vincent Victoria, and Best Actress for Wykesha King as Hattie McDaniel. 

===Whereabouts of the McDaniel Oscar===
The whereabouts of McDaniel&#x27;s Oscar are currently unknown.
In 1992, &quot;Jet&quot; magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s.
Since the matter has become one of public discussion, in 1998 Howard University faced a barrage of negative press charging that it negligently &quot;lost&quot; the Oscar or, alternatively, allowed it to be stolen.

In 2007, an article in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; two years later, in 2009.

In November 2011, W. Burlette Carter at George Washington University Law School published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar&#x27;s fate. Howard could find no official records of receipt. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar and thrown it in the Potomac River as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; stories. She argued that the Oscar had likely been returned to Howard University&#x27;s Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973, or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the award.

===Homeowners&#x27; covenant case victory===
McDaniel was the most famous of the black homeowners who helped to organize the black West Adams neighborhood residents who saved their homes. Loren Miller, an attorney and the owner and publisher of the &quot;California Eagle&quot; newspaper, represented the minority homeowners in their restrictive covenant case.

In 1938, McDaniel – along with other Black stars of the time including Ethel Waters and Louise Beavers – moved into a colonial mansion on 24th street in the West Adams Heights neighborhood in West Adams. When the West Adams Heights tract was laid out in 1902, many of its early residents were required to sign a restrictive covenant. Amongst requirements such as building a &quot;first-class residence&quot;, of at least two stories, costing no less than two-thousand dollars (at a time when a respectable home could be built for a quarter of that amount, including the land), and built no less than thirty-five feet from the property&#x27;s primary boundary&quot;, residents were also prohibited from selling or leasing their property to people of color. By the mid-1930s, most of the restrictions had expired, making space for non-Caucasian residents to move into the neighborhood. &quot;The Heights&quot; became particularly popular amongst prominent Black figures between 1938 and 1945. West Adam Heights became known as &quot;Sugar Hill&quot;.

On December 6, 1945, some of the white West Adam Heights residents filed a lawsuit against 31 Black residents – including McDaniel. McDaniel held workshops to strategize for the case and gathered around 250 sympathizers to accompany her to court. Judge Thurmond Clarke left the courtroom to see the disputed neighborhood and threw out the case the following day. He said, &quot;It is time that members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Judges have been avoiding the real issue too long.&quot; McDaniel&#x27;s case would go on to set a precedent that later impacted the 1948 &quot;Shelley v. Kramer&quot; Supreme Court ruling which in summary states that &quot;holding that state courts may not enforce racially restrictive covenants&quot;.

On December 17, 1945, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported:

McDaniel had purchased her white, two-story, seventeen-room house in 1942. The house included a large living room, dining room, drawing room, den, butler&#x27;s pantry, kitchen, service porch, library, four bedrooms and a basement. McDaniel had a yearly Hollywood party. Everyone knew that the king of Hollywood, Clark Gable, could always be found at McDaniel&#x27;s parties.

<text>The Green Room (a.k.a. The Fabulous Green Room) was a popular recording studio located in Huntington Beach, California, described by Bill Lobdell of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;arguably the center of the Christian rock world&quot; in Orange County. The Green Room was owned and operated by musician Gene Eugene and Brainstorm art director/photographer Anna Cardenas until Eugene&#x27;s death in 2000.

==History==
The Green Room was located on the first floor of Eugene&#x27;s home in Huntington Beach. It served as something of a community center for Christian rock musicians in the area. 

The studio had been active since the 1980s; Eugene and Cardenas took over management of The Green Room in 1993, and ran it until Eugene died in his sleep at the studio in March 20. After Eugene&#x27;s death, longtime collaborator Chris Colbert stepped in to take over Eugene&#x27;s projects at the studio. Cardenas was later forced to sell the studio in 2002.

Artists who frequently recorded at The Green Room include Eugene&#x27;s own bands, Adam Again, Lost Dogs (who also named two of their CDs and a song after the studio), and The Swirling Eddies. Others who recorded there include Daniel Amos, Poor Old Lu, Starflyer59, Anointed, The Waiting and Randy Stonehill.
