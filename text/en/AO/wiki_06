<text>The &#x27; (, or ; or &#x27;), translated as The Song of the Nibelungs, is an epic poem written around 1200 in Middle High German. Its anonymous poet was likely from the region of Passau. The is based on an oral tradition of Germanic heroic legend that has some of its origin in historic events and individuals of the 5th and 6th centuries and that spread throughout almost all of Germanic-speaking Europe. Scandinavian parallels to the German poem are found especially in the heroic lays of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.

The poem is split into two parts. In the first part, the prince Siegfried comes to Worms to acquire the hand of the Burgundian princess Kriemhild from her brother King Gunther. Gunther agrees to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild if Siegfried helps Gunther acquire the warrior-queen Brünhild as his wife. Siegfried does this and marries Kriemhild; however, Brünhild and Kriemhild become rivals, leading eventually to Siegfried&#x27;s murder by the Burgundian vassal Hagen with Gunther&#x27;s involvement. 

In the second part, the widow Kriemhild is married to Etzel, king of the Huns. She later invites her brother and his court to visit Etzel&#x27;s kingdom intending to kill Hagen. Her revenge results in the death of all the Burgundians who came to Etzel&#x27;s court as well as the destruction of Etzel&#x27;s kingdom and the death of Kriemhild herself.

The was the first heroic epic put into writing in the German vernacular, helping to found a larger genre of written heroic poetry there. The poem&#x27;s tragedy appears to have bothered its medieval audience, and very early on a sequel was written, the , which made the tragedy less final. The poem was forgotten after around 1500 but was rediscovered in 1755. Dubbed the &quot;German &quot;Iliad&quot;&quot;, the began a new life as the German national epic. The poem was appropriated for nationalist purposes and was heavily used in anti-democratic, reactionary, and Nazi propaganda before and during the Second World War. Its legacy today is most visible in Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic cycle , which, however, is mostly based on Old Norse sources. In 2009, the three main manuscripts of the were inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in recognition of their historical significance. It has been called &quot;one of the most impressive, and certainly the most powerful, of the German epics of the Middle Ages&quot;.

==Versions and manuscripts==
There are 37 known manuscripts and manuscript fragments of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; and its variant versions. Eleven of these manuscripts are essentially complete. Twenty-four manuscripts are in various fragmentary states of completion, including one version in Dutch (manuscript &quot;T&quot;).

The text of the different manuscripts of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; varies considerably from one another, though there is less variance than found in many other Middle High German heroic epics, such as the Dietrich epics. Although the different versions vary in their exact wording and include or exclude stanzas found in other versions, the general order of events, the order of the appearance of characters, their actions, and the content of their speeches are all relatively stable between versions extant before the 1400s. Generally, scholars have proposed that all versions of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; derive from an original version (the &quot;archetype&quot;) via alterations and reworking; instead proposes that the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; has always existed in variant forms, connecting this variance to the transmission of the epic&#x27;s material from orality to literacy.

Using the versions provided by the three oldest complete manuscripts, the Hohenems-Munich manuscript A (c. 1275-1300), the Sankt Gall manuscript B (c. 1233-1266), and the Hohenems-Donaueschingen manuscript C (c. 1225-1250), scholars have traditionally differentiated two versions that existed near the time of the poem&#x27;s composition; A and B are counted as belonging to a single version *AB, while a version *C is attested by manuscript C and most of the earliest fragments, including the oldest attestation of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Using the final words of the epic, *AB is also called the &quot;Not&quot;-version, and *C the &quot;Lied-&quot;version; the *C version is clearly a reworking of an earlier version, but it is not clear if this version was *AB; *AB may also be an expanded version of an earlier text. Most scholars assume that manuscript B is the closest to the original *AB version.

By 1300, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; was circulating in at least five versions:
#the &quot;Not&quot;-version *A;
#the &quot;Not&quot;-version *B;
#the &quot;Lied&quot;-version *C;
#in a mixed version *Db;
#in a mixed version *Jdh (or *J/*d).
Most fragments from after 1300 belong to the two mixed versions (), which appear to be based on copies of both the &quot;Not&quot; and &quot;Lied&quot; versions. Three later manuscripts provide variant versions: one, m (after 1450), is lost while two are still extant: n (c. 1470/80) and k (c.1480/90). Manuscripts m and n contain a story of Siegfried&#x27;s youth that more closely resembles that found in the Old Norse &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot; and early modern German &quot;Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot;, while k shortens the text and modernizes the language.

==Synopsis==
===Opening stanza===
The famous opening of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is actually thought to be an addition by the adaptor of the &quot;*C&quot; version of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, as it does not appear in the manuscript of B, which probably represents the earlier version. It may have been inspired by the prologue of the &quot;Nibelungenklage&quot;.

;Original (MS C)
:Uns ist in alten mæren || wunders vil geseit
:von helden lobebæren,|| von grôzer arebeit,
:von fröuden, hôchgezîten, || von weinen und von klagen,
:von küener recken strîten || muget ir nu wunder hœren sagen.

;Modern German
:Uns ist in alten Geschichten viel Staunenswertes gesagt
:von ruhmwürdigen Helden, von großer Mühsal (im Kampf),
:von Freuden und Festen, von Weinen und Klagen,
:vom Kampf kühner Helden könnt ihr jetzt viel Staunenswertes sagen hören.

;English
:In ancient tales many marvels are told us:
:of renowned heroes worthy of praise, of great hardship,
:of joys, festivities, of weeping and lamenting,
:of bold warriors&#x27; battles—now you may hear such marvels told.

Manuscript B instead begins with the introduction of Kriemhild, the protagonist of the work.

===Part 1===
Kriemhild grows up as a beautiful woman in Worms, the capital of the Burgundian kingdom, under the protection of her brothers Gunther, Gernot, and Giselher. There she has a dream portending doom, in which she raises a falcon that is killed by two eagles. Her mother explains that this means she will love a man who will be killed; Kriemhild thus swears to remain unmarried.

At the same time, the young Siegfried is receiving his courtly education in the Netherlands; he is dubbed a knight and decides that he will go to Worms to ask for Kriemhild as his wife. The story of how Siegfried slew a dragon, winning a large hoard of gold, and then bathed in the dragon&#x27;s blood to receive an impenetrable skin is then recounted by Hagen, one of Gunther&#x27;s vassals, when the Burgundians see Siegfried approaching. Siegfried lives in Worms for a year without seeing Kriemhild before Siegfried helps Gunther fight against attack by the Saxons and Danes. Because of his valor in combat, he is finally allowed to see Kriemhild.
Gunther decides that he wishes to take the Icelandic queen Brünhild as his wife. However, Brünhild is supernaturally strong and challenges those seeking her hand in marriage in various martial and physical contests, killing the losers. Therefore, Gunther wants Siegfried&#x27;s help; Siegfried tells Gunther he shouldn&#x27;t marry Brünhild, but is convinced to help by Gunther&#x27;s promise that he will let him marry Kriemhild in exchange. Arriving in Iceland, Siegfried claims to be Gunther&#x27;s vassal and uses his magical cloak of invisibility () to secretly help Gunther win in all of the contests and Brünhilt agrees to return to Worms and marry Gunther. Once they have returned, Siegfried ask Kriemhild to marry him; this displeases Brünhild, as she believes Siegfried to be a vassal while Kriemhild is the daughter of a king. When Gunther does not explain why he is letting a vassal marry his sister, Brünhild refuses to sleep with him on their wedding night, instead tying him up and hanging him from a hook. The next night, Gunther asks Siegfried to wrestle Brünhild into submission using his ; Siegfried takes Brünhilds belt and ring as a trophy and then lets Gunther take her virginity, causing her to lose her strength.

After the wedding, Siegfried and Kriemhild return to the Netherlands. Before they do, Kriemhild wants to ask for her part of the inheritance from her brothers, but Siegfried advises her not to. Kriemhild wishes to take Hagen with her, but he refuses. Many years pass. In the Netherlands, Siegfried and Kriemhild are crowned; both couples have a son.

Brünhild is unhappy that Siegfried, whom she still believes to be Gunther&#x27;s vassal, never comes to pay tribute. She convinces Gunther to invite Siegfried and Kriemhild to Worms for a feast. However, she and Kriemhild soon begin arguing about which of their husband&#x27;s has the higher rank. The conflict peaks when both Kriemhild and Brünhild arrive at the cathedral at the same time; the higher ranking one should enter first. Brünhild repeats her assertion that Siegfried is a vassal, after which Kriemhild claims that Siegfried, not Gunther, took Brünhild&#x27;s virginity, producing the ring and belt as proof. Siegfried and Gunther afterwards deny this, but Brünhild remains offended. Hagen advises Gunther to have Siegfried murdered.
Hagen goes to Kriemhild and tells her that there is a new war brewing against the Saxons; he would like to know where Siegfried is vulnerable so that he can protect him. Kriemhild agrees to mark the spot between Siegfried&#x27;s shoulder blades where a leaf had prevented his skin from becoming invulnerable. Rather than a war, however, Gunther invites Siegfried to go hunting. When Siegfried is bent over a spring to drink water, Hagen spears him in the back, killing him. The body is placed in front of Kriemhild&#x27;s door. Kriemhild immediately suspects Gunther and Hagen and her suspicions are confirmed when Siegfried&#x27;s corpse bleeds in Hagen&#x27;s presence. Siegfried is buried and Kriemhild chooses to stay in Worms, eventually officially reconciling with Hagen and her brothers though she stays in mourning. Hagen has Siegfried&#x27;s hoard taken from her. Kriemhild remains unmarried for 13 years.

===Part 2===
After the death of his first wife, Helche, Etzel, the king of the Huns, chooses to ask Kriemhild to marry him. All of the Burgundians except for Hagen are in favor of the match. Kriemhild only agrees after Etzel&#x27;s messenger, Margrave Rüdiger von Bechelaren, swears loyalty to her personally and she realizes she can use the Huns to gain revenge on Siegfried&#x27;s murderers. Before her departure, she demands Siegfried&#x27;s treasure but Hagen refuses her. After seven years as Etzel&#x27;s wife, Kriemhild bears him a son, Ortlieb, and after thirteen years, she convinces Etzel to invite her brothers and Hagen to a feast. In Worms, Hagen advises against traveling to Etzel&#x27;s castle, but Gunther and his brothers believe that Kriemhild has reconciled with them and decide to go. Nevertheless, they take Hagen&#x27;s advice to travel with an army.

The departure of the Burgundians, who are now increasingly called Nibelungs, is accompanied by various ill omens, but these are all dismissed by Hagen. When the Burgundians are about to cross the Danube in Bavaria, Hagen encounters three nixies, who prophecy to him that only the king&#x27;s chaplain will return from Etzel&#x27;s hall. To try to prove the prophecy false, Hagen throws the chaplain overboard from the ferry, but he swims to shore and returns to Worms. Hagen then destroys the ferry once they have landed to show that there can be no return. When the Bavarians attack the Burgundians in order to avenge their ferryman, whom Hagen had killed, Hagen takes control of the defense and defeats them. The Burgundians then arrive in Etzel&#x27;s kingdom and are welcomed to the city of Bechelaren by the Margrave Rüdiger; on Hagen&#x27;s suggestion, Rüdiger betroths his daughter to Gisleher and gives Gernot a sword and Hagen a shield.

When the Burgundians arrive at Etzelnburg, they are warned by Dietrich von Bern that Kriemhild hates them. Kriemhild greets only Gisleher with a kiss and asks Hagen if he has brought with him what he took from her; later, she approaches him wearing her crown and in the company of many armed men. Hagen refuses to stand up for Kriemhild and places Siegfried&#x27;s sword across her legs; recognizing it, Kriemhild&#x27;s accompanying Huns still refuse to attack Hagen. Etzel, meanwhile, is clueless about these events and welcomes his guests warmly.

Hagen advises the Burgundians to remain armed. Fighting almost breaks out at a tournament when the Burgundian Volker von Alzey kills a Hun in a joust, but Etzel is able to prevent it. Kriemhild then seeks to convince Dietrich von Bern and Hildebrand to attack the Burgundians; they refuse, but Etzel&#x27;s brother Bloedelin agrees. At the following feast, Kriemhild has her and Etzel&#x27;s son Ortlieb brought into the hall. Bloedelin then attacks and kills the Burgundian squires outside the feast hall, but is killed by Hagen&#x27;s brother, Dankwart. When Dankwart, the sole survivor, enters the hall and reports the attack, Hagen beheads Ortlieb, and fighting breaks out within the feast hall itself. The Huns are unarmed and slaughtered, but Dietrich and Hildebrand arrange for Etzel, Kriemhild, Rüdiger, and their own men to exit the hall.
The Burgundians barricade themselves in the hall, which is besieged by Etzel&#x27;s warriors. Various Hunnish attempts to attack are repulsed, but a truce cannot be agreed because Kriemhild demands that Hagen be handed over to her. Kriemhild orders the hall set on fire, but the Burgundians survive. The next day, Etzel and Kriemhild force Rüdiger to enter the battle, although he is bound by guest-friendship and kinship to the Burgundians. He fights Gernot and the two kill each other. Rüdiger&#x27;s death causes Dietrich von Bern&#x27;s heroes to intervene, although Dietrich has told them not to. The conflict leads to the death of all the Burgundians except Hagen and Gunther, and all of Dietrich&#x27;s heroes except for his mentor Hildebrand. Dietrich himself now fights and takes Hagen and Gunther prisoner.

Kriemhild demands that Hagen give her back what he has taken from her. He convinces her that he will tell her where Siegfried&#x27;s hoard is if she first kills Gunther, but afterwards tells her that now she will never learn. Kriemhild kills Hagen with Siegfried&#x27;s sword. That this great hero has been killed by a woman sickens Etzel, Dietrich, and Hildebrand. Hagen&#x27;s death so enrages Hildebrand that he kills Kriemhild.

==Authorship and dating==
The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, like other Middle High German heroic epics, is anonymous. This anonymity extends to discussions of literature in other Middle High German works: although it is common practice to judge or praise the poems of others, no other poet refers to the author of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Attempts to identify the &quot;Nibelungenlied-&quot;poet with known authors, such as Bligger von Steinach, to whom a lost epic is attributed by Gottfried von Strassburg, have not found wide acceptance. The poem is nevertheless believed to have had a single author, possibly working in a &quot;Nibelungen workshop&quot; (&quot;&quot;) together with the author of the &quot;Nibelungenklage&quot;. The latter work identifies a &quot;meister Konrad&quot; as the author of an original Latin version of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, but this is generally taken for a fiction. Although a single &quot;Nibelungenlied-&quot;poet is often posited, the degree of variance in the text and its background in an amorphous oral tradition mean that ideas of authorial intention must be applied with caution. It is also possible that there were several poets involved, perhaps under the direction of a single &quot;leader&quot; who could be considered the &quot;&quot;Nibelungenlied-&quot;poet&quot;.

The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is conventionally dated to around the year 1200. Wolfram von Eschenbach references the cook Rumolt, usually taken to be an invention of the &quot;Nibelungenlied-&quot;poet, in his romance &quot;Parzival&quot; (c. 1204/5), thereby providing an upper bound on the date the epic must have been composed. Additionally, the poem&#x27;s rhyming technique most closely resembles that used between 1190 and 1205. Attempts to show that the poem alludes to various historical events have generally not been convincing.

The current theory of the creation of the poem emphasizes the poet&#x27;s concentration on the region of Passau: for example, the poem highlights the relatively unimportant figure of Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, and the poet&#x27;s geographical knowledge appears much more firm in this region than elsewhere. These facts, combined with the dating, have led scholars to believe that Wolfger von Erla, Bishop of Passau (reigned 1191–1204) was the patron of the poem. Wolfger is known to have patronized other literary figures, such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Thomasin von Zirclaere. The attention paid to Bishop Pilgrim, who represents the real historical figure Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, would thus be an indirect homage to Wolfger. Wolfger was, moreover, attempting to establish the sainthood of Pilgrim at the time of the poem&#x27;s composition, giving an additional reason for his prominence.

Some debate exists as to whether the poem is an entirely new creation or whether there was a previous version. German medievalist Jan-Dirk Müller claims that the poem in its written form is entirely new, although he admits the possibility that an orally transmitted epic with relatively consistent contents could have preceded it. German philologist Elisabeth Lienert, on the other hand, posits an earlier version of the text from around 1150 due to the &quot;Nibelungenlied&#x27;s&quot; use of a stanzaic form current around that time (see Form and style).

Whoever the poet may have been, they appear to have had a knowledge of German Minnesang and chivalric romance. The poem&#x27;s concentration on love (&quot;minne&quot;) and its depiction of Siegfried as engaging in love service for Kriemhild is in line with courtly romances of the time, with Heinrich von Veldeke&#x27;s &quot;Eneasroman&quot; perhaps providing concrete models. Other possible influences are Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Iwein&quot; and &quot;Erec&quot;. These courtly elements are described by Jan-Dirk Müller as something of a façade, under which the older heroic ethos of the poem remains. Additionally, the poet seems to have known Latin literature. The role given to Kriemhild in the second (originally first) stanza is suggestive of Helen of Troy, and the poem appears to have taken a number of elements from Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. There is some debate as to whether the poet was acquainted with Old French &quot;chanson de geste&quot;.

==Form and style==
The language of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is characterized by its formulaic nature, a feature of oral poetry, meaning that similar or identical words, epithets, phrases, and even lines can be found in various positions throughout the poem. These elements can be used flexibly for different purposes in the poem. As the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is generally thought to have been conceived as a written work, these elements are typically taken as signs of &quot;fictive orality&quot; (&quot;&quot;) that underscore the connection of the poem to its traditionally oral subject matter.

The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; is written in four-line stanzas. Although no melody has survived for the text, melodies for similar stanzas in other German heroic poems have, so that it is certain that the text was meant to be sung. The stanza consists of three (&quot;long lines&quot;), which consist of three metrical feet, a caesura, and three metrical feet following the caesura. The fourth line adds an additional foot following the caesura, making it longer than the other three and marking the end of the stanza. The final word before the caesura is typically female (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable), whereas the final word of a line is typical male (a stressed syllable). The lines rhyme in pairs, and occasionally there are internal rhymes between the words at the end of the caesura, as in the first stanza (see Synopsis). Medieval German literature scholar Victor Millet uses the poem&#x27;s sixth stanza as an example of this metrical form. An acute accent indicates the stressed beat of a metrical foot, and || indicates the caesura:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Ze Wórmez bí dem Ríne&quot; || &quot;si wónten mít ir kráft.&quot;
&quot;in díente vón ir lánden&quot; || &quot;vil stólziu ríterscáft&quot;
&quot;mit lóbelíchen éren&quot; || &quot;unz án ir éndes zít.&quot;
&quot;si stúrben sit jǽmerlíche&quot; || &quot;von zwéier édelen fróuwen nít.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Many stanzas of the poem are constructed in a much less regular manner. It is likely that the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; cites an oral story-telling tradition in using singable stanzas; however, the longer final line is generally thought to belong to a more refined artistic milieu, as later heroic epics typically use a stanza without this longer final line (the so-called &quot;Hildebrandston&quot;). The stanzaic form of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, on the other hand, is shared with the Danubian minnesinger known as Der von Kürenberg who flourished in the 1150s and 1160s. The &quot;Nibelungenlied-&quot;poet may have been inspired by this lyrical stanza. Their use of the stanza would thus cite an oral story-telling tradition while at the same time creating some distance to it. Philologist Andreas Heusler supposed that the poet had taken some earlier orally transmitted stanzas and added a fourth foot to their final line, as these supposedly older stanzas are characterized by a more archaic vocabulary as well. German medievalist Jan-Dirk Müller notes that while it would be typical of a medieval poet to incorporate lines from other works in their own, no stanza of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; can be proven to have come from an older poem.

The nature of the stanza creates a structure whereby the narrative progresses in blocks: the first three lines carry the story forward, while the fourth introduces foreshadowing of the disaster at the end or comments on events. The fourth line is thus often the most formulaic of the stanza. Stanzas often seem to have been placed after each other without necessarily being causally or narratively connected; for instance, two consecutive stanzas might portray two different reactions to an event by the same figure. Often, the same reaction is given to multiple figures in different stanzas, so that the impression of collective rather than individual reactions is created. Enjambment between stanzas is very rare. The epic frequently creates multiple motivations for events, some of which may contradict each other. This style of narration also causes the events within the poem to come to a frequent halt, which can last for years within the time portrayed in the poem. The division of the epic into () underlines the disconnect between the various episodes. The connection between the first half of the epic (Siegfried&#x27;s murder) and the second half (Kriemhild&#x27;s marriage to Etzel) is especially loose. The epic nevertheless maintains the causal and narrative connection between episodes through the commentary of the narrator, who frequently reminds the poem&#x27;s audience of the coming catastrophe, while the manner in which the epic is told serves to delay the inevitable disaster. The action becomes more and more intense as the epic nears its end.

==Origins==
===Historical origins and development of the saga===

Behind &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; stands a large oral tradition, the so-called Nibelungen saga. This oral tradition, moreover, continued to exist following the composition of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, as proven by the &quot;Rosengarten zu Worms&quot; and &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot;, both of which were written later than the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; but contain elements of the saga that are absent in it. These oral traditions have, at least in some cases, a historical core. However, various historical events and figures have been melded together into a single plot in such a way that the original historical context has been lost. The epic, and presumably the oral traditions that provided its material, have transformed historical events into relatively simple narrative schemas that can be compared with other, similar (originally) oral narratives from other cultures. What had originally been political motivations have been &quot;personalized&quot;, so that political events are explained through personal preferences, likes, dislikes, and feuds rather than purely by realpolitik. Various historical personages, moreover, appear to be contemporaries in the poem despite not having lived at the same time historically.

The Nibelungen saga also seems to have had an early reception in Scandinavia, so that parallel stories are found among the heroic lays of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; (written down in 1270 but containing at least some much older material) and in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; (written down in the second half of the thirteenth century). While the Norse texts were once usually considered to contain a more original version of the Nibelungen saga, newer scholarship has called this into question and notes that the connections made to Norse mythology and Germanic paganism, such as the semi-divine origin of the Nibelungen hoard, are likely more recent developments that are therefore unique to the Scandinavian tradition. Some elements of the Norse tradition, however, are assuredly older.

The death of the Burgundians finds its origins in the destruction of the historical Burgundian kingdom on the Rhine. This kingdom, under the rule of king Gundaharius, was destroyed by the Roman general Flavius Aetius in 436/437, with survivors resettled in eastern Gaul in a region centered around modern-day Geneva and Lyon (at the time known as Lugdunum). The &quot;Lex Burgundionum&quot;, codified by the Burgundian king Gundobad at the end of the sixth century, contains many names that can be connected with the Nibelungen saga, including, besides Gundaharius, Gislaharius (Giselher), Gundomaris (possibly the historical figure behind the Old Norse Gothorm, who is replaced by Gernot in the German tradition), and Gibica (attested in Germany as Gibich but not found in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;). Although the Burgundian kingdom on the Rhine is thus historically attested, the saga locates its destruction at the court of Attila (Etzel), king of the Huns. The destruction of Attila&#x27;s kingdom itself is likely inspired by Attila&#x27;s sudden death following his wedding in 453, which was popularly blamed on his wife, a Germanic woman named Hildico. Her name, containing the element &quot;hild&quot;, may have inspired that of Kriemhild. Kriemhild most likely originally killed Etzel and avenged her relatives rather than her husband, but this change had already taken place some time before the creation of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Jan-Dirk Müller doubts that we can be certain which version is more original given that in both cases Kriemhild brings about the destruction of the Hunnish kingdom. The differences may be because the continental saga is more favorable to Attila than the Norse, and so Attila could not be held directly responsible for the treacherous invitation of the Burgundians.

Unlike the Burgundians, Siegfried cannot be firmly identified with a historical figure. He may have his origins in the Merovingian dynasty, where names beginning with the element &quot;Sigi-&quot; were common and where there was also a famous and violent queen Brunhilda (543–613). The feud between this historical Brunhilda and the rival queen Fredegund may have provided the origin of the feud between Brünhild and Kriemhild. The name &quot;Siegfried&quot; itself is a relatively recent one, only being attested from the seventh century onward, meaning that the original name may have been equivalent to the Old Norse &quot;Sigurd&quot;. Scholars such as Otto Höfler have speculated that Siegfried and his slaying of the dragon may be a mythologized reflection of Arminius and his defeat of the Roman legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Jan-Dirk Müller suggests that Siegfried likely has a more mythological origin. The story of the destruction of the Burgundians and Siegfried appear to have been originally unconnected. The Old Norse &quot;Atlakviða&quot;, a poem likely originally from the ninth century that has been reworked as part of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, tells the story of the death of the Burgundians without any mention of Sigurd (Siegfried) and can be taken as an attestation for an older tradition. In fact, the earliest attested work to connect Siegfried explicitly with the destruction of the Burgundians is the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; itself, though Old Norse parallels make it clear that this tradition must have existed orally for some time.

===The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;-poet&#x27;s reworking of the saga===
When composing the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, its poet was faced with setting an oral tradition down into a definitive version although that tradition was by its very nature amorphous. In choosing which elements of the saga to include in his version, the poet therefore often incorporated two versions of an event that were likely not combined in the oral tradition. An example is the beginning of the fighting in Etzel&#x27;s hall, which is motivated both by an attack on the Burgundians&#x27; supplies and Hagen&#x27;s killing of prince Ortlieb. The Old Norse &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot;, which is based on German sources, contains only the second element, meaning that the two motivations were likely variants that were hardly ever combined in practice. Victor Millet concludes that the poet deliberately doubles the motivations or occurrences of various events, including Siegfried&#x27;s wooing of Kriemhild, the deception of Brünhild, Hagen&#x27;s humiliation of Kriemhild, and Kriemhild&#x27;s demand for the return of Nibelungen treasure.

The poet also appears to have significantly altered various aspects of the saga. Most significantly, the poet has suppressed the mythological or fantastical elements of Siegfried&#x27;s story. When these elements are introduced, it is in a retrospective tale narrated by Hagen that reduces the slaying of the dragon to a single stanza. Hagen&#x27;s story, moreover, does not accord with Siegfried&#x27;s youth as the narrator of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; has portrayed it, in which he receives a courtly education in Xanten. More elaborate stories about Siegfried&#x27;s youth are found in the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; and in the later heroic ballad &quot;Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot;, both of which appear to preserve German oral traditions about the hero that the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;-poet decided to suppress for their poem.

The portrayal of Kriemhild, particularly in the first half of the romance, as a courtly lady is likely an invention of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;-poet. Earlier (and many later) attestations of Kriemhild outside of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; portray her as obsessed with power and highlight her treachery to her brothers rather than her love for her husband as her motivation for betraying them. The poet still uses images from this traditional picture, but given the new motivation of the poem&#x27;s Kriemhild, their meaning has changed. For instance, when Kriemhild demands that Hagen give back what he has taken from her, a traditional motif known from the Norse versions, she could mean the stolen hoard, but she could also mean her murdered husband. Hagen, similarly, in demanding that Gunther first be killed before he reveals the hoard&#x27;s location, even though the hoard is at the bottom of the Rhine and cannot be retrieved, reveals Kriemhild&#x27;s mercilessness while also showing his own duplicity. It is unclear which figure is in the right and which in the wrong.

==Medieval influence and reception==
With 36 extant manuscripts, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; appears to have been one of the most popular works of the German Middle Ages and seems to have found a very broad audience. The poem is quoted by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his &quot;Parzival&quot; and &quot;Willehalm&quot; and likely inspired his use of stanzas in his unfinished &quot;Titurel&quot;. The manuscript witnesses and medieval references to the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; show that medieval recipients were most interested in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; as the story of the destruction of the Burgundians; the first half of the poem was often shortened or otherwise summarized. The Ambraser Heldenbuch titles its copy of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; with &quot;Ditz Puech heysset Chrimhilt&quot; (this book is named &quot;Kriemhild&quot;), showing that she was seen as the most important character.

The areas of medieval interest seem in particular to have been the inescapability of the slaughter at the end of the poem and Kriemhild and Hagen&#x27;s culpability or innocence. The earliest attested reception of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, the &quot;Nibelungenklage&quot;, which was likely written only shortly afterwards, shows an attempt both to make sense of the horror of the destruction and to absolve Kriemhild of blame. The C version of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, redacted around the same time as the &quot;Klage&quot;, shows a similar strategy. The presence of the &quot;Nibelungenklage&quot; in all manuscripts of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; shows that the ending of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; itself was evidently unsatisfying to its primary audience without some attempt to explain these two &quot;scandalous&quot; elements. The &quot;Rosengarten zu Worms&quot;, on the other hand, demonizes Kriemhild thoroughly, while the late-medieval &quot;Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid&quot; takes her side even more strongly.

As the first Middle High German heroic poem to be written, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; can be said to have founded an entire genre of Middle High German literature. As a result, other Middle High German heroic poems are sometimes described as &quot;post-Nibelungian&quot; (&quot;nachnibelungisch&quot;). The majority of these epics revolve around the hero Dietrich von Bern, who plays a secondary role in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;: it is likely that his presence there inspired these new poems. Many of the following heroic epics appear to respond to aspects of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;: the &quot;Kudrun&quot; (c. 1250), for instance, has been described as a reply to the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; that reverses the heroic tragedy of the previous poem. Kudrun herself is sometimes seen as a direct reversal of Kriemhild, as she makes peace among warring factions rather than driving them to their deaths. No Middle High German heroic epic after the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; maintains the tragic heroic atmosphere that characterized earlier Germanic heroic poetry, and the later poems are often further hybridized with elements of chivalric romance.

Reception of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; ceases after the fifteenth century: the work is last copied in manuscript as part of the Ambraser Heldenbuch around 1508, and its last mention is by the Viennese historian Wolfgang Lazius in two works from 1554 and 1557 respectively. It was not printed and appears to have been forgotten. The Nibelungen saga, however, was not forgotten completely; the &quot;Rosengarten zu Worms&quot; was printed as part of the printed Heldenbuch until 1590 and inspired several plays in the early seventeenth century, while &quot;Hürnen Seyfrid&quot; continued to be printed into the nineteenth century in a prose version.

==Modern reception==

After having been forgotten for two hundred years, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; manuscript C was rediscovered by Jacob Hermann Obereit in 1755. That same year, Johann Jacob Bodmer publicized the discovery, publishing excerpts and his own reworkings of the poem. Bodmer dubbed the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; the &quot;German &quot;Iliad&quot; (&quot;), a comparison that skewed the reception of the poem by comparing it to the poetics of a classical epic. Bodmer attempted to make the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; conform more closely to these principles in his own reworkings of the poem, leaving off the first part in his edition, titled &quot;Chriemhilden Rache&quot;, in order to imitate the &quot;in medias res&quot; technique of Homer. He later rewrote the second part in dactylic hexameter under the title &quot;Die Rache der Schwester&quot; (1767). Bodmer&#x27;s placement of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; in the tradition of classical epic had a detrimental effect on its early reception: when presented with a full edition of the medieval poem by Christoph Heinrich Myller, King Frederick II famously called the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; &quot;not worth a shot of powder&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Goethe was similarly unimpressed, and Hegel compared the epic unfavorably to Homer. The epic nevertheless had its supporters, such as August Wilhelm Schlegel, who called it a &quot;great tragedy&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in a series of lectures from 1802/3. Many early supporters sought to distance German literature from French Classicism and belonged to artistic movements such as &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;.

As a consequence of the comparison of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; came to be seen as the German national epic in the earlier nineteenth century, particularly in the context of the Napoleonic Wars. The &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; was supposed to embody German bourgeois virtues that the French were seen as lacking. This interpretation of the epic continued during the Biedermeier period, during which the heroic elements of the poem were mostly ignored in favor of those that could more easily be integrated into a bourgeois understanding of German virtue. The translation of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; by Karl Simrock into modern German in 1827 was especially influential in popularizing the epic and remains influential today. Also notable from this period is the three-part dramatic tragedy &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; by Friedrich Hebbel.

Following the founding of the German Empire, recipients began to focus more on the heroic aspects of the poem, with the figure of Siegfried in particular becoming an identifying figure for German nationalism. Especially important for this new understanding of the poem was Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, which, however, was based almost entirely on the Old Norse versions of the Nibelung saga. Wagner&#x27;s preference for the Old Norse versions followed a popular judgment of the time period: the Nordic versions were seen as being more &quot;original&quot; than the courtly story portrayed in the German poem. In the First World War, the alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary came to be described as possessing &quot;Nibelungen-Treue&quot; (Nibelungen loyalty), referring to the loyalty to death between Hagen and the Burgundians. While militaristic, the use of imagery from the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; remained optimistic in this period rather than focusing on the doom at the end of the epic.

The interwar period saw the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; enter the world of cinema in Fritz Lang&#x27;s two part film &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924/1925), which tells the entire story of the poem. At the same time, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; was heavily employed in anti-democratic propaganda following the defeat of Germany and Austria-Hungary. The epic supposedly showed that the German people were more well suited to a heroic, aristocratic form of life than democracy. The betrayal and murder of Siegfried was explicitly compared to the &quot;stab in the back&quot; that the German army had supposedly received. At the same time, Hagen and his willingness to sacrifice himself and fight to the death made him into a central figure in the reception of the poem. During the Second World War, Hermann Göring would explicitly use this aspect of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; to celebrate the sacrifice of the German army at Stalingrad and compare the Soviets to Etzel&#x27;s Asiatic Huns.

Postwar reception and adaptation of the poem, reacting to its misuse by the Nazis, is often parodic. At the same time, the poem continues to play a role in regional culture and history, particularly in Worms and other places mentioned in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Much discussion has centered on whether and how the epic ought to be taught in schools. The material of the Nibelungen saga has continued to inspire new adaptations. These include &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, a German remake of Fritz Lang&#x27;s film from 1966/67, and the television film &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot; from 2004. However, the majority of popular adaptations of the material today in film, computer games, comic books, etc., are not based on the medieval epic directly.

Outside of Germany, most reception of the Nibelungen material has taken place via Wagner, although the epic has been translated into English numerous times.

<text>John Garrett Olerud Jr. (; born August 5, 1968) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays team that won two consecutive World Series championships in and . He also played for the New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox.

A two-time All-Star, Olerud was a patient, productive hitter throughout his career, winning the American League batting title in 1993, and finishing as runner-up for the National League batting title in 1998. Olerud was also an excellent defensive first baseman, and won three Gold Glove Awards. In 1999, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; titled &quot;The Best Infield Ever?&quot; along with Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey Ordóñez, and Robin Ventura, when he played for the Mets. Olerud was notable for wearing a helmet while on defense, due to his suffering from a brain aneurysm in college.

== Early life ==
Olerud was born to Lynda and John E. Olerud, a dermatologist and former baseball player from Lisbon, North Dakota. The elder Olerud played college baseball for the Washington State Cougars as a catcher and was the captain of the team that advanced to the semifinals of the College World Series in 1965. An All-American, he was selected by the California Angels in the 1965 amateur draft and spent the next seven years studying medicine and playing minor league baseball.

At Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington, the junior Olerud played varsity basketball, golf, and baseball for three years. As a senior in 1986, he led the Saints to a state championship as both a pitcher and a first baseman. At age 17, he was selected by the New York Mets in the 27th round of the June 1986 amateur draft, but chose to attend Washington State University.

== College baseball ==
Like his father, Olerud played college baseball for the Washington State University Cougars in Pullman under head coach Chuck &quot;Bobo&quot; Brayton. As a true freshman in 1987, he hit .414 with five home runs and 20 RBIs. As a pitcher, he went 8–2 with a 3.00 ERA and was an All-American. Washington State finished third in the six-team West I regional of the NCAA tournament.

In 1988, Olerud hit .464 with 23 home runs, 81 runs batted in, 108 hits, 204 total bases, and a .876 slugging percentage. As a pitcher, he had an undefeated 15–0 season, with a 2.49 ERA and 113 strikeouts. He was a consensus All-American as both a first baseman and pitcher and was named the &quot;Baseball America&quot; College Player of the Year. Washington State University again finished third in the six-team West I regional of the NCAA tournament.

Prior to his junior season in 1989, Olerud was running indoors on campus on January 11 when he collapsed; hospitalized in Pullman, he was airlifted to Spokane later in the day, accompanied by his father. He was diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which caused bleeding into the spinal column. He remained in the hospital for about two weeks after the seizure and lost , but was back in class by the end of January. A few weeks later in Seattle, further examinations revealed a brain aneurysm, and he underwent surgery in late February. From 1989 onward, he always wore a batting helmet while on defense.

Olerud returned to action for the Cougars in mid-April; he hit .359 with five home runs and 30 runs batted in during 78 plate appearances. On the mound, he posted a 3–2 record with a 6.68 ERA. He was a Pac-10 North All-League designated hitter. The Cougars again won the Pac-10 North title, but lost their first two games of the North tournament in blustery Spokane to end their year early.

In June, the Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the third round of the 1989 draft. Intending to return to the Cougars for his senior season, he again played summer ball with the Palouse Empire team in the Alaska League, while the Blue Jays negotiated a contract. He told teams prior to the draft that a very large bonus would be necessary for him to forego his senior year at Washington State. In late August, he signed with Toronto.

== Professional career ==
In a 17-season career through 2005 spanning 2,234 games, Olerud posted a .398 on-base percentage, 500 doubles, 255 home runs, 1,275 walks, 1,408 runs scored, 1,230 RBIs, 3,602 times on base, 96 sacrifice flies, and 157 intentional walks. He was also hit by pitches 88 times and grounded into 232 double plays during his career. He is one of only 26 players to ever hit for the cycle multiple times in their careers. Defensively, in 2,053 games at first base, he recorded a career .995 fielding percentage. He is a two-time All-Star and a member of two World Series-winning teams with the Blue Jays (1992–93).

Olerud jumped directly to the majors after a stellar career at Washington State, where he was a pitcher noted for his performance from 1987 to 1989. He had originally intended to return to Washington State for his senior year but agreed to sign with the Blue Jays only after they promised that he would report directly to Toronto. He was known for always wearing a batting helmet in the field as a precaution, due to the aneurysm he suffered at age twenty.

=== Toronto Blue Jays ===
Olerud broke into MLB with the Toronto Blue Jays in , without ever playing in the minors. Prior to the season, he was named the #3 prospect in MLB by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. He was platooned by Jays&#x27; manager Cito Gaston for the first few years of his career, until , when he became the team&#x27;s full-time first baseman. In , his breakout season, he led the American League in batting average (.363), intentional walks (33), times on base (321), on-base percentage (.473), OPS (1.072), and doubles (54, also a career-high), while posting career-highs in home runs (24), RBIs (107), runs (109), and hits (200). He flirted with a .400 batting average for much of the season, with his average staying higher than .400 as late as August 2.

Despite putting up solid numbers over the next several years, he failed to meet the high expectations placed upon him following his breakout performance in 1993. After the 1996 season, Olerud was battling veteran Joe Carter and up-and-comer Carlos Delgado for a spot at either first base or designated hitter. Delgado was young, had a bright future and a low salary, while Gaston preferred Carter to Olerud, feeling the latter wasn&#x27;t aggressive enough at the plate. Therefore, Olerud was traded, along with cash, to the New York Mets on December 20 for Robert Person.

=== New York Mets ===

With the Mets, he set a team record in 1998 by reaching base at least twice in 12 straight starts. Olerud set team single-season records for batting average (.354), on-base percentage (.447) and runs created (138) in 1998. He was in the race for the National League batting title until the final day of the season, when Larry Walker edged him out with a .363 average. In the 1999 campaign, Olerud appeared on the cover of the September 6 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, along with fellow Mets infielders Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey Ordóñez, and Robin Ventura. The magazine raised the debate as to whether the four talented fielders comprised the best defensive infield in major league history. He set Mets records for most walks (125) and times on base (309) in a season that year.

=== Seattle Mariners ===
Following the 1999 season, Olerud returned home, agreeing to a three-year, $20 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. In 2000, he amassed 45 doubles, 102 walks, 10 sacrifice flies and 11 intentional walks. He was an important part of the Mariners&#x27; historic 2001 season in which they tied the record for most wins in a major league baseball season with 116. Olerud contributed to the effort with a .401 on-base percentage, 94 walks, 272 times on base and 19 intentional walks in 159 games. In 2002, he recorded a .403 on-base percentage, 39 doubles, 98 walks, 269 times on base and led the American League with 12 sacrifice flies. In 2003, he collected another 84 walks. Olerud also earned all three of his Gold Glove Awards while playing first base for Seattle in 2000, 2002, and 2003. In mid-July 2004, the Mariners were in last place in the American League West Division and Olerud was designated for assignment; he was hitting .245 with five homers and a trade was attempted but not completed; he was released the following 

=== New York Yankees ===
About a week after his release, Olerud was signed in early August by the New York Yankees to fill a void left at first base by the injury of Less than two weeks later, the Yankees visited Seattle to play the Mariners. Olerud started the second game on Saturday, August 14; his first time up, Mariners catcher Dan Wilson went to the mound to have a &quot;conference&quot; with pitcher Jamie Moyer. This gave time for about a minute-long standing ovation for Olerud from the His American League Championship Series was cut short when he was forced to leave due to an injured foot in Game 3. Olerud pinch-hit in Game 7 but struck out after a lengthy at-bat against Pedro Martínez, making a rare relief appearance; it was Olerud&#x27;s last at-bat as a Yankee.

=== Boston Red Sox ===
On May 2, 2005, the Boston Red Sox and Olerud agreed to terms on a minor league contract. He had been recovering from surgery in November 2004 to repair torn ligaments in his left foot. Initially, Olerud reported to the club&#x27;s spring training complex in Fort Myers, Florida. He was added to Boston&#x27;s 25-man roster on May 27, sharing time at first base with Kevin Millar and batting in the middle of the lineup (including several starts in the clean-up spot).

=== Retirement ===
Following the 2005 season, Olerud announced his retirement from baseball on December 6. At the time, his 2,239 career hits represented the 143rd-highest total in major league history. His career .398 on base percentage ranks 65th, and his 500 doubles are 44th.

In 2007, Olerud was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2016, Olerud was named Pac-12 Player of the Century when the conference released its All-Century Baseball team. He was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in the Class of 2020, although he was not inducted until 2023. The collegiate John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year Award is named after him.

== Personal life ==
Olerud became an evangelical Christian in 1990. Olerud lives with his wife, Kelly, who was a high school classmate, and their children (one son and one daughter) in the Seattle suburb of Clyde Hill. Another daughter, Jordan, died at age 19 in 2020 from complications of a unique chromosomal disorder called tri-some 2p, 5p-. Olerud is a cousin of retired MLB player Dale Sveum.

<text>In graph theory, a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same degree or valency. A regular directed graph must also satisfy the stronger condition that the indegree and outdegree of each internal vertex are equal to each other. A regular graph with vertices of degree is called a graph or regular graph of degree .
==Special cases==
Regular graphs of degree at most 2 are easy to classify: a graph consists of disconnected vertices, a graph consists of disconnected edges, and a graph consists of a disjoint union of cycles and infinite chains.

A graph is known as a cubic graph.

A strongly regular graph is a regular graph where every adjacent pair of vertices has the same number of neighbors in common, and every non-adjacent pair of vertices has the same number of neighbors in common. The smallest graphs that are regular but not strongly regular are the cycle graph and the circulant graph on 6 vertices.

The complete graph is strongly regular for any .

== Existence ==

The necessary and sufficient conditions for a formula_1-regular graph of order formula_2 to exist are that formula_3 and that formula_4 is even.

Proof: A complete graph has every pair of distinct vertices connected to each other by a unique edge. So edges are maximum in complete graph and number of edges are formula_5 and degree here is formula_6. So formula_7. This is the minimum formula_2 for a particular formula_1. Also note that if any regular graph has order formula_2 then number of edges are formula_11 so formula_12 has to be even.
In such case it is easy to construct regular graphs by considering appropriate parameters for circulant graphs.

==Properties==
From the handshaking lemma, a -regular graph with odd has an even number of vertices.

A theorem by Nash-Williams says that every graph on vertices has a Hamiltonian cycle.

Let &quot;A&quot; be the adjacency matrix of a graph. Then the graph is regular if and only if formula_13 is an eigenvector of &quot;A&quot;. Its eigenvalue will be the constant degree of the graph. Eigenvectors corresponding to other eigenvalues are orthogonal to formula_14, so for such eigenvectors formula_15, we have formula_16.

A regular graph of degree &quot;k&quot; is connected if and only if the eigenvalue &quot;k&quot; has multiplicity one. The &quot;only if&quot; direction is a consequence of the Perron–Frobenius theorem.

There is also a criterion for regular and connected graphs :
a graph is connected and regular if and only if the matrix of ones &quot;J&quot;, with formula_17, is in the adjacency algebra of the graph (meaning it is a linear combination of powers of &quot;A&quot;).

Let &quot;G&quot; be a &quot;k&quot;-regular graph with diameter &quot;D&quot; and eigenvalues of adjacency matrix formula_18. If &quot;G&quot; is not bipartite, then

: formula_19

== Generation ==
Fast algorithms exist to generate, up to isomorphism, all regular graphs with a given degree and number of vertices.

<text>Erik Thorvaldsson (), known as Erik the Red, was a Norse explorer, described in medieval and Icelandic saga sources as having founded the first European settlement in Greenland. Erik most likely earned the epithet &quot;the Red&quot; due to the color of his hair and beard. According to Icelandic sagas, Erik was born in the Jæren district of Rogaland, Norway, as the son of Thorvald Asvaldsson; to which Thorvald would later be banished from Norway, and would sail west to Iceland with Erik and his family. During Erik&#x27;s life in Iceland, he married Þjódhild Jorundsdottir and would have four children, with one of Erik&#x27;s sons being the well-known Icelandic explorer Leif Erikson. Around the year of 982, Erik was exiled from Iceland for three years, during which time he explored Greenland, eventually culminating in his founding of the first successful European settlement on the island. Erik would later die there around 1003 CE during a winter epidemic.

==Personal life ==

===Early life===
Erik Thorvaldsson was born in Rogaland, Norway in 950 CE, and was the son of Thorvald Asvaldsson (also spelled Osvaldsson). Thorvald would later be banished from Norway for committing acts of manslaughter. Thorvald would then proceed to sail west from Norway with his family, including a 10-year-old Erik. Thorvald and his family would eventually settle in Hornstrandir in northwestern Iceland, where Thorvald would eventually die sometime before 970 CE.

===Marriage and family===
After his father&#x27;s death, Erik married Þjódhild Jorundsdottir and moved to Haukadalr (Hawksdale) where he built a farm called Eiríksstaðir; Þjódhild was the daughter of Jorundur Ulfsson and Þorbjorg Gilsdottir. Medieval Icelandic tradition relates that Erik and his wife Þjódhild had four children: a daughter, Freydís, and three sons, the explorer Leif Erikson, Thorvald and Thorstein. Unlike his son Leif and Leif&#x27;s wife, who became Christians, Erik remained a follower of Norse paganism. While Erik&#x27;s wife took heartily to Christianity, even commissioning Greenland&#x27;s first church, Erik greatly disliked it and stuck to his Norse gods—which, the sagas relate, led Þjódhild to withhold intercourse from her husband.

===Exile===
Similar to his father before him, Erik also found himself exiled for a time. The initial confrontation occurred when Erik&#x27;s thralls (slaves) caused a landslide on a neighboring farm belonging to a man named Valthjof, and Valthjof&#x27;s friend, Eyjolf the Foul, killed the thralls. In retaliation, Erik killed Eyjolf as well as Hrafn the Dueller (Holmgang-Hrafn). Kinsmen of Eyjolf sought legal prosecution and Erik was later banished from Haukadale for killing Eyjolf the Foul around the year 982.

Erik then moved to Brokey and Öxney (Eyxney) island in Iceland. Erik asked a man named Thorgest to keep his &quot;setstokkr&quot;—inherited ornamented pillars of significant mystical value—which his father had brought from Norway. When Erik had finished building his new home, he went back to retrieve his pillars from Thorgest; however, Thorgest refused to return them to Erik, and so Erik then went to Breidabolstadr and took the pillars back. As a result, Thorgest and his men gave chase, and in the ensuing fight Erik slew both of Thorgest&#x27;s sons as well as &quot;some other men&quot;. After this conflict both Erik and Thorgest kept close a large number of allies. 

Styr gave assistance to Eirik, as also did Eyjolf, of Sviney, Thorbjorn Vifilsson, and the sons of Thorbrand, of Alptafjordr (Swanfirth). But the sons of Thord Gellir, as also Thorgeir, of Hitardalr (Hotdale), Aslak, of Langadalr (Longdale), and Illugi, his son, gave assistance to Thorgest. The dispute between Erik and Thorgest was later resolved at the Thorsnes Thing, where Erik and the men that sided with him were outlawed from Iceland for three years; many of these men would then join Erik on his expedition to Greenland.

===Death===
Erik&#x27;s son Leif Erikson became the first Norseman to explore the land of Vinland–part of North America, presumably near modern-day Newfoundland–and invited his father on the voyage. However, according to the sagas, Erik fell off his horse on the way to the ship and took this as a bad sign, leaving his son to continue without him. Erik later died in an epidemic that killed many of the colonists in the winter after his son&#x27;s departure.

== Discoveries ==
It has been a common mistake for popular history to occasionally credit Erik as being the first European to discover Greenland, however, the Icelandic sagas suggest that earlier Norsemen discovered and attempted to settle it before him. Tradition credits Gunnbjörn Ulfsson (also known as Gunnbjörn Ulf-Krakuson) with the first sighting of the land-mass. Nearly a century before Erik, strong winds had driven Gunnbjörn towards a set of islands between Iceland and Greenland, later named Gunnbjörn&#x27;s skerries in his honor. However, the accidental nature of Gunnbjörn&#x27;s discovery has led to his neglect in the history of Greenland. After Gunnbjörn, roughly eighty years later the outlaw Snæbjörn galti had also visited Greenland and attempted to settle there. According to a saga that has now been lost to time, Galti headed the first Norse attempt to colonize Greenland, of which ended in failure for Galti and his party due to the many unforgiving hardships that they faced during the winter on the island. As a result of Galti&#x27;s failed expedition, Erik the Red is widely credited to be the first known, and successful, permanent settler of Greenland.
==Voyages==
Erik the Red (c. 950–1003 AD), a Norse explorer, is best known for settling Greenland. Banished from Iceland for manslaughter, he sailed west around 982 AD, exploring and naming Greenland to attract settlers. After three years of scouting the land, he returned to Iceland and led a fleet of 25 ships, bringing Norse settlers to Greenland in 985 AD. Two settlements—Eastern and Western Settlements—were established, sustaining Norse life for centuries.

===Greenland===
During his exile, around 982, Erik sailed to a somewhat mysterious and little-known land that Snæbjörn galti Hólmsteinsson had unsuccessfully attempted to settle a few years before. Erik rounded the southern tip of the island, later known as Cape Farewell, and sailed up the western coast. Eventually, Erik reached a part of the coast that, for the most part, seemed ice-free and consequently had conditions—similar to those of Iceland—that promised growth and future prosperity. According to the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, Erik spent his three years of exile exploring this land. The first winter Erik spent on the island of Eiriksey, the second winter he passed in Eiriksholmar (close to Hvarfsgnipa). In the final summer Erik explored as far north as Snaefell and into Hrafnsfjord.

When Erik returned to Iceland after his exile had expired, he is said to have brought with him stories of &quot;Greenland&quot;. Erik purposefully gave the land a more appealing name than &quot;Iceland&quot; as &quot;people would be attracted to go there if it had a favorable name&quot;, per Erik&#x27;s own words. Erik knew that the success of any settlement in Greenland would need the support of as many people as possible.

Erik&#x27;s salesmanship of Greenland proved successful as after spending the winter in Iceland, Erik returned to Greenland in the summer of 985 with a large number of colonists. However, out of 25 ships that left for Greenland, 11 were lost at sea; only 14 arrived. The Icelanders established two colonies on the southwest coast: the Eastern Settlement or Eystribyggð, in what is now Qaqortoq, and the Western Settlement, close to present-day Nuuk. Eventually, a Middle Settlement grew, but many suggest it formed part of the Western Settlement. The Eastern and Western Settlements, both established on the southwest coast, proved the only two areas suitable for farming. During the summers, when the weather was more favorable to travel, each settlement would send an army of men to hunt in Disko Bay above the Arctic Circle for food and other valuable commodities such as seals (used for rope), ivory from walrus tusks, and beached whales.
==== Eastern Settlement ====
In the Eastern Settlement, Erik built the estate of Brattahlíð, near present-day Narsarsuaq, in what is known today as Qassiarsuk. Erik held the title of paramount chieftain of Greenland and became both greatly respected and wealthy.

The settlement flourished, growing to 5,000 inhabitants spread over a considerable area along Eriksfjord and neighboring fjords. Groups of immigrants escaping overcrowding in Iceland joined the original party. However, one group of immigrants which arrived in 1002 brought with it an epidemic that ravaged the colony, killing many of its leading citizens, including Erik himself. Nevertheless, the colony rebounded and survived until the Little Ice Age made the land marginal for European life-styles in the 15th century–shortly before Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first voyage to the Americas in 1492. Pirate raids, conflict with Inuit moving into the Norse territories, and the colony&#x27;s abandonment by Norway became other factors in its decline.

== Comparisons to Greenland saga ==

There are numerous parallels between the Saga of Erik the Red and the Greenland saga, including recurring characters and recountings of the same expeditions, though with a few notable differences. The saga of Erik the Red portrays a number of the expeditions in the Greenland saga as just one expedition led by Thorfinn Karlsefni, although Erik&#x27;s son Thorvald, his daughter Freydís and Karlsefni&#x27;s wife Gudrid play key roles in the retelling. Another notable difference is the location of their settlements. According to the Grœnlendinga saga, Karlsefni and the others settled in a place that is referred to only as Vinland, while in Erik the Red&#x27;s saga they formed two base settlements: Straumfjǫrðr where they spent the winter and the following spring, and Hop where they later settled but ran into problems with the natives they called Skrælings, as depicted in the Greenland saga. The two accounts are largely similar otherwise, both with heavy emphasis on the exploits of Thorfinn Karlsefni and his wife Gudrid.

==Historical Impact==
Erik’s Greenland colony became the first known European settlement in the Americas, predating Columbus by nearly 500 years. His son, Leif Erikson, continued his legacy, reaching Vinland (Newfoundland, Canada) around 1000 AD. Erik’s voyages expanded Viking exploration and trade, influencing European knowledge of the West. His Greenland settlement played a key role in medieval Norse expansion but eventually declined due to climate change and resource scarcity.

<doc id="85843" wikidata="Q300923" url="?curid=85843" title="Amphiuma">
<text>Amphiuma is a genus of aquatic salamanders from the United States, the only extant genus within the family Amphiumidae . They are colloquially known as amphiumas. They are also known to fishermen as &quot;conger eels&quot; or &quot;Congo snakes&quot;, which are zoologically incorrect designations or misnomers, since amphiumas are actually salamanders (and thus amphibians), and not fish, nor reptiles and are not from Congo. &quot;Amphiuma&quot; exhibits one of the largest complements of DNA in the living world, around 25 times more than a human.

== Taxonomy ==
Numerous phylogenetic studies have indicated that amphiumas form a clade with the families Rhyacotritonidae (torrent salamanders) and Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders), with an especially close relationship to Plethodontidae. Despite this possible relationship, the two families must have still diverged very early on. The genus &quot;Proamphiuma&quot; from the Cretaceous is the earliest known member of the family, and closely resembles the modern species aside from less elaborate vertebral structures.

== Description ==
Amphiumas have an elongated body, generally grey-black in color. They do have legs, but they are merely vestigial and very small. While amphiumas can be up to long, their legs measure only up to about . It is because of this that they are often mistaken for eels or snakes. They also lack eyelids and a tongue. Amphiumas also have a lateral line visible on the sides of their bodies, which is capable of detecting movement and is used in aid of hunting.

Female amphiumas lay their eggs in wet mud, and then remain coiled around them for about five months, until they hatch. The larvae have external gills, but after about four months these external gills disappear and the lungs begin to work. One pair of gill slits is retained and never disappears, so the metamorphosis remains incomplete.

=== Species ===
There are three extant amphiuma species, distinguished by the number of toes:

==== Extant ====
==== Extinct ====

* †&quot;Amphiuma jepseni&quot; (Paleocene of Wyoming)
* †&quot;Amphiuma antica&quot; (Miocene of Texas)

== Distribution ==
Amphiumas inhabit the southeastern part of the United States. They share much of the same distribution with the sirens, although they are not closely related.

In the past, amphiumas had a wider geographic range throughout North America, ranging all the way north to Wyoming.

== Behavior ==
During the day, amphiumas hide in vegetation, and at night they become active hunters. Their prey includes frogs, snakes, fish, crustaceans, insects and even other amphiumas. Hunting and eating habits have been observed to be very similar to that of the axolotl, including the sucking in of food by their stomachs with vacuum force. If provoked, they can become aggressive. They can be found in most wetlands in the coastal plain of the southeastern U.S., even ones which periodically dry out, as they are able to estivate in the moist mud below drained marshland and other ephemeral wetlands. Amphiumas are rarely encountered on land.

It is the female that courts the male before mating. When a pair is formed they wrap their bodies around each other, and the male will transfer a spermatophore directly into the female cloaca (cloacal apposition).

=== Food habits ===
The amphiuma&#x27;s predatory behaviors and food selection are very calculated and variable depending on abundance of food. In addition to eating frogs, snakes, fish, crustaceans, insects, and other amphiuma, amphiuma have been found to eat annelids, vegetables, arachnids, mollusca, and larvae. Amphiuma seem to have a preference for eating crawfish. It has been documented that amphiuma will pass on smaller crawfish in order to consume larger ones. It is suggested that this limits wasting energy in pursuing prey with less caloric density. In captivity, the predatory behavior amphiuma display depends on the presence or lack of food. Amphiuma will remain inactive when food is absent, and will become more active once food has been introduced into their habitat. This shows that the amphiuma, although ancestral to many amphibia, has developed a deductive approach to its predation.

== Anatomy ==

=== Jaw muscles ===
Amphiuma are primarily carnivorous amphibians that consume crayfish, insects, and other small invertebrates. Similar to many salamanders, the amphiuma has two distinct forms of suction feeding procedures: stationary and strike. Stationary suction feeding involve little to no movement where it opens the mouth with buccal expansion but no forward movement of the body. strike suction is rapid motion where the mouth opens and buccal expansion occurs synchronously leading to a quick attack. These two feeding habits give the amphiuma the ability to have a larger variety of food (live or dead). amphiuma&#x27;s ability to displace its jaw to feed means they can consume a large variety of organisms as well. But amphiuma&#x27;s narrow jaw makes it harder for them to fully consume large prey such as crayfish or mice. In these cases, they will use one of the forms of suction feeding and then rip the prey into pieces until fully consumed. Small prey will be pulled completely into the mouth before being eaten. Structure of the teeth within the jaw tend to be arched caudal on the head. The muscles of the jaw give them the ability to grab and hold on to prey as well as create a negative pressure to suck in the prey and displace the jaw. Muscles of note in the amphiuma include: the levator mandibulae anterior and levator mandibulae externus, which elevate the lower jaw of the amphiuma while the depressor mandibulae depresses the lower jaw. The intermandubularis works by tensing the mouth floor. The branchiohyoideus and geniohyoideus draws the hyoid arch which causes the suction and displacement.

=== Lungs ===
Amphiuma possess relatively ancestral forms of lungs compared to some of the other groups of salamanders that live terrestrially today. Their lungs are long organs, extending over half of the body length, with dense capillary networks and large surface area that suggest the utilization of the entire lung for respiration while the animal is in water or on land. Although it is common for amphibia to respire out of their skin, also known as cutaneous respiration, it was found that amphiuma primarily respire through their lungs, despite their aquatic lifestyle. This is suggested by the high lung to respiratory capillary density compared to the relatively low skin to respiratory capillary density.
==== Respiration ====
Pressure gradients for respiration occur in two different locations, the buccal cavity/nares (mouth and nostril) region, and in the lungs of the amphiuma. The first system for respiration occurs in the buccal cavity/nares through a two-cycle pressure-induced buccal cavity/nares process. In the first system, the amphiuma performs one full cycle of body expansion and compression in order to inhale and another full cycle to exhale, a unique process that utilizes both the buccal cavity and the nares (openings of nostrils). The buccal cavity creates pressure that aids in driving the cycles of expansion and compression required for respiration, although it was found that the buccal pressure gradient alone was not enough to drive respiration in the &quot;Amphiuma tridactylum&quot;. Rather, the buccal cavity allows for small pressure changes that are thought to have an olfactory purpose. This buccal cavity/nares component to the amphiuma respiratory process supplements the contribution performed by the lung. It is the pressure control performed in the lungs that drive the inhalation and exhalation forces through the flexing of smooth muscle in the lung. In order to exhale, amphiuma push air from their lungs into their buccal cavity, distending the cavity, before releasing the air. Without inhaling, amphiuma repeat the process, exhaling a second volume of air that allows them to completely empty their lungs. Only after both exhales can they then inhale, using a negative pressure gradient made by the smooth muscles in their lungs to take in air. 

== Sexual dimorphism ==
Amphiuma demonstrate sexual dimorphism in relation to the size of their bodies and the size of their heads. Generally, males have been found to possess larger bodies and longer heads compared to the female sex, which normally is indicative of male-male combat observed within the population. There has been, however, no other physical indicating factors for male-male combat as in other species of amphibians, such as horns or spines. Some populations do not show these sexual dimorphic traits, and in certain locations female and male bodies do not exhibit any traits with significant differences.

Amphiumas may be sexed as male or female based on the pigmentation of the cloacal opening. Males exhibit white or pink coloration while females exhibit dark pigmentation. Occasionally, males may demonstrate partial pigmentation, but never have full dark coloration like that of females.

<text>Thorvald Ásvaldsson ( ; Modern Icelandic: ; 10th century; died before 980) was the father of the first Norse settler of Greenland, Erik the Red, and grandfather of Leif Erikson, who visited North America centuries before Christopher Columbus. Thorvald&#x27;s father was Ásvald Ulfsson, whose father was Ulf Oxen-Thorisson, whose father was Oxen-Thorir, brother of Naddodd, discoverer of Iceland.

Thorvald Ásvaldsson was born in Norway. He fathered Erik the Red with a woman whose name is unknown. He was exiled from Norway in , during the reign of King Haakon the Good (son of Harald Fairhair), &quot;because of some killings.&quot; He left with his son Erik to northwest Iceland, where he died before 980. According to the &quot;Grænlendinga Saga&quot; (&quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;), &quot;There was a man called Thorvald, who was the father of Eirik the Red.

<text>A longsword (also spelled as long sword or long-sword) is a type of European sword characterized as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for primarily two-handed use (around ), a straight double-edged blade of around , and weighing approximately .

The &quot;longsword&quot; type exists in a morphological continuum with the medieval knightly sword and the Renaissance-era Zweihänder. It was prevalent during the late medieval and Renaissance periods (approximately 1350 to 1550), with early and late use reaching into the 12th and 17th centuries.

== Names ==

=== English ===
The longsword has many names in the English language, which, aside from variant spellings, include terms such as &quot;bastard sword&quot; and &quot;hand-and-a-half sword.&quot; Of these, &quot;bastard sword&quot; is the oldest, its use being contemporaneous with the weapon&#x27;s heyday.

The French &quot;&quot; and the English &quot;bastard sword&quot; originate in the 15th or 16th century, originally in the general sense of &quot;irregular sword, sword of uncertain origin&quot;, but by the mid-16th century could refer to exceptionally large swords.
The &quot;Masters of Defence&quot; competition organised by Henry VIII in July 1540 listed &quot;two handed sword&quot; and &quot;bastard sword&quot; as two separate items.
It is uncertain whether the same term could still be used to other types of smaller swords, but antiquarian usage in the 19th century established the use of &quot;bastard sword&quot; as referring unambiguously to these large swords.

The term &quot;hand-and-a-half sword&quot; is relatively modern (from the late 19th century);
this name was given because the balance of the sword made it usable in one hand, as well as two. During the first half of the 20th century, the term &quot;bastard sword&quot; was also used regularly to refer to this type of sword, while &quot;long sword&quot; (or &quot;long-sword&quot;), if used at all, referred to the rapier (in the context of Renaissance or Early Modern fencing).

Another name originating from the 19th century is &quot;broadsword,&quot; which grew out of comparisons of the blade to more slender swords. This name is common in non-expert literature, where it often refers generically to any medieval sword. However, it more properly—and historically—refers to the basket-hilted swords of the 18th century.

Contemporary use of &quot;long-sword&quot; or &quot;longsword&quot; only resurfaced in the 2000s in the context of reconstruction of the German school of fencing, translating the German &quot;&quot;. Prior to this the term &quot;long sword&quot; merely referred to any sword with a long blade; &#x27;long&#x27; being simply an adjective rather than a classification.

=== Other languages ===
Historical (15th to 16th century) terms for this type of sword included Portuguese &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27; for the version with longer handle used exclusively with both hands; Spanish &#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;, Italian &#x27; or &#x27;, and Middle French &#x27;. The Scottish Gaelic &#x27; means &quot;great sword&quot;; anglicised as &quot;claymore,&quot; it came to refer to a large Scottish type of longsword with a V–shaped crossguard.
Historical terminology overlaps with that applied to the Zweihänder sword in the 16th century: French &#x27;, Spanish &#x27;, or Portuguese &#x27; may also be used more narrowly to refer to these large swords. The French &#x27; may also refer to a medieval single-handed sword optimized for thrusting.

The German &#x27; (&quot;long sword&quot;) in 15th and 16th-century manuals does not denote a type of weapon, but the technique of fencing with both hands at the hilt, contrasting with &#x27; (&quot;short sword&quot;) used of fencing with the same weapon, but with one hand gripping the blade (also known as a half-sword).

==Evolution==
The longsword is characterized not so much by a longer blade, but by a longer grip, which indicates a weapon designed for two-handed use. Swords with exceptionally long hilts are found throughout the High Middle Ages. For example, there is a longsword in The Glasgow Art and History Museum, Labelled XIIIa. 5, which scholars have dated back to between 1100 and 1200 due to the hilt style and specific taper, but swords like this remain incredibly rare, and are not representative of an identifiable trend before the late 13th or early 14th century.

The longsword as a late medieval type of sword emerges in the 14th century, as a military steel weapon of the earlier phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It remains identifiable as a type during the period of about 1350 to 1550.
It remained in use as a weapon of war intended for wielders wearing full plate armour either on foot or on horseback, throughout the late medieval period.
From the late 15th century, however, it is also attested as being worn and used by unarmoured soldiers or mercenaries.

Use of the two-handed Great Sword or &quot;Schlachtschwert&quot; by infantry (as opposed to their use as a weapon of mounted and fully armoured knights) seems to have originated with the Swiss in the 14th century.

By the 16th century, its military use was mostly obsolete, culminating in the brief period where the oversized Zweihänder were wielded by the German &quot;Landsknechte&quot; during the early to mid 16th century. By the second half of the 16th century, it persisted mostly as a weapon for sportive competition (&quot;Schulfechten&quot;), and possibly in knightly duels.

Distinct &quot;bastard sword&quot; hilt types developed during the first half of the 16th century. Ewart Oakeshott distinguishes twelve different types. These all seem to have originated in Bavaria and in Switzerland. By the late 16th century, early forms of the developed-hilt appear on this type of sword.
Beginning about 1520, the Swiss sabre (&quot;schnepf&quot;) in Switzerland began to replace the straight longsword, inheriting its hilt types, and the longsword had fallen out of use in Switzerland by 1550.
In southern Germany, it persisted into the 1560s, but its use also declined during the second half of the 16th century.
There are two late examples of longswords kept in the Swiss National Museum, both with vertically grooved pommels and elaborately decorated with silver inlay, and both belonging to Swiss noblemen in French service during the late 16th and early 17th century, Gugelberg von Moos and Rudolf von Schauenstein.
The longsword, greatsword and bastard-sword were also made in Spain, appearing relatively late, known as the &#x27;, the &#x27; and &#x27; or &#x27; respectively.

==Morphology==
The swords grouped as &quot;longswords&quot; for the purposes of this article are united by their being intended for two-handed use. In terms of blade typology, they do not form a single category. In the Oakeshott typology of blade morphology, &quot;longswords&quot; figure as a range of sub-types of the corresponding single-handed sword types.

*Types XIIa and XIIIa represent the Great Sword or War Sword type used in the 11th and in the 14th century. They represent larger versions of type XII and type XIII swords which were the standard knightly swords during the Crusades. They are primarily intended for cutting, with grips for either &quot;hand-and-half&quot; or two-handed use. Type XIIa blades are broad, flat and evenly tapering, with a lenticular cross-section and a fuller running along about two thirds of the blade&#x27;s length. Type XIIIa blades are broad, with a flat lenticular cross-section, parallel edges and a fuller running along half the blade&#x27;s length.
*Type XVa is the classical two-handed sword of the 14th and 15th centuries (with early examples appearing from the later 13th century). These blades are strongly tapered, more narrow and slender even than the single-handed type XV variant, with a flattened diamond cross-section.
*Type XVIa is the classical &quot;longsword&quot; of the 14th and 15th centuries. These blades are long and slowly tapering, with a flat hexagonal blade cross-section and a fuller running along one third of the blade. They represent an optimised compromise between thrusting capability and retaining good cutting characteristics.
*Type XVII is a shorter-lived type, popular during the mid-14th to early 15th century. These blades are long, slender and acutely tapering, approaching the outline of type XVa, while still retaining a narrow hexagonal cross-section and a shallow fuller running along about one quarter of the blade.
*Types XVIIIb and XVIIIc represent the later longswords of the mid-15th to early 16th centuries. They have a flattened diamond cross-section, often with pronounced mid-rib, some being hollow-ground. Type XVIIIb blades are slender, comparable to XVa blades but longer, measuring between 90 and 107 cm, with a correspondingly longer grip, often waisted for comfortable two-handed use. Type XVIIIc blades are somewhat broader and shorter (about 85 cm), and sometimes have a short and narrow fuller.
*Type XX blades are broad, with lenticular or octagonal cross-sections. Their defining characteristics is that they have three fullers, a shallow central fuller running along half the blade&#x27;s length, with two shallow parallel fullers along the first quarter. They were in use during the 14th and 15th centuries. Sub-type XXa has a more acutely tapering blade and a more acute point.

==Fighting with the longsword==
The expression &#x27; (&quot;fencing with the long sword&quot;) in the German school of fencing denotes the style of fencing which uses both hands at the hilt; &#x27; (&quot;fencing with the short sword&quot;) is used in half-sword fighting, with one hand gripping the blade.
The two terms are largely equivalent to &quot;unarmoured fighting&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;armoured fencing&quot; (&#x27;).

===History===

Codified systems of fighting with the longsword existed from the later 14th century, with a variety of styles and teachers each providing a slightly different take on the art. Hans Talhoffer, a mid-15th-century German fightmaster, is probably the most prominent, using a wide variety of moves, most resulting in wrestling. The longsword was a quick, effective, and versatile weapon capable of deadly thrusts, slices, and cuts. The blade was generally used with both hands on the hilt, one resting close to or on the pommel. The weapon may be held with one hand during disarmament or grappling techniques.
In a depiction of a duel, individuals may be seen wielding sharply pointed longswords in one hand, leaving the other hand open to manipulate the large dueling shield.

Another variation of use comes from the use of armour. Half-swording was a manner of using both hands, one on the hilt and one on the blade, to better control the weapon in thrusts and jabs. This versatility was unique, as multiple works hold that the longsword provided the foundations for learning a variety of other weapons including spears, staves, and polearms. Use of the longsword in attack was not limited only to use of the blade, however, as several Fechtbücher explain and depict use of the pommel and cross as offensive weapons. The cross has been shown to be used as a hook for tripping or knocking an opponent off balance. Some manuals even depict the cross as a hammer.

What is known of combat with the longsword comes from artistic depictions of battle from manuscripts and the Fechtbücher of Medieval and Renaissance Masters. Therein the basics of combat were described and, in some cases, depicted. The German school of swordsmanship includes the earliest known longsword Fechtbuch, a manual from approximately 1389, known as GNM 3227a. This manual, unfortunately for modern scholars, was written in obscure verse. It was through students of Liechtenauer, like Sigmund Ringeck, who transcribed the work into more understandable prose that the system became notably more codified and understandable. Others provided similar work, some with a wide array of images to accompany the text.

The Italian school of swordsmanship was the other primary school of longsword use. The 1410 manuscript by Fiore dei Liberi presents a variety of uses for the longsword. Like the German manuals, the weapon is most commonly depicted and taught with both hands on the hilt. However, a section on one-handed use is among the volume and demonstrates the techniques and advantages, such as sudden additional reach, of single-handed longsword play. The manual also presents half-sword techniques as an integral part of armoured combat.

Both schools declined in the late 16th century, with the later Italian masters forgoing the longsword and focusing primarily on rapier fencing. The last known German manual to include longsword teaching was that of Jakob Sutor, published in 1612. In Italy, &quot;&quot;, or longsword, instruction lingered on despite the popularity of the rapier, at least into the mid-17th century (Alfieri&#x27;s &quot;Lo Spadone&quot; of 1653), with a late treatise of the &quot;two handed sword&quot; by one Giuseppe Colombani, a dentist in Venice dating to 1711. A tradition of teaching based on this has survived in contemporary French and Italian stick fighting.

===German school of fencing===
========

&quot;&quot; (&quot;blosz fechten&quot;) or &quot;bare fighting&quot; is the technique of fighting without significant protective armour such as plate or mail.

The lack of significant torso and limb protection leads to the use of a large amount of cutting and slicing techniques in addition to thrusts. These techniques could be nearly instantly fatal or incapacitating, as a thrust to the skull, heart, or major blood vessel would cause massive trauma. Similarly, strong strikes could cut through skin and bone, effectively amputating limbs. The hands and forearms are a frequent target of some cuts and slices in a defensive or offensive manoeuvre, serving both to disable an opponent and align the swordsman and his weapon for the next attack.

====Harnischfechten====

&#x27;, or &quot;armoured fighting&quot; (German &#x27;, or &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;fighting in armour on foot&quot;), depicts fighting in full plate armour.

The increased defensive capability of a man clad in full plate armour caused the use of the sword to be drastically changed. While slashing attacks were still moderately effective against infantry wearing half-plate armour, cutting and slicing attacks against an opponent wearing plate armour were almost entirely ineffective in providing any sort of slashing wound as the sword simply could not cut through the steel, although a combatant could aim for the chinks in a suit of armour, sometimes to great effect. Instead, the energy of the cut becomes essentially pure concussive energy. The later hardened plate armours, complete with ridges and roping, posed a threat against the careless attacker. It is considered possible for strong blows of the sword against plate armour to damage the blade of the sword, potentially rendering it much less effective at cutting and producing only a concussive effect against the armoured opponent.

To overcome this problem, swords began to be used primarily for thrusting. The weapon was used in the half-sword, with one or both hands on the blade. This increased the accuracy and strength of thrusts and provided more leverage for &quot;&quot; or &quot;wrestling at/with the sword&quot;. Also, the hand on the blade increases its rigidity which is advantageous when thrusting. This technique combines the use of the sword with wrestling, providing opportunities to trip, disarm, break, or throw an opponent and place them in a less offensively and defensively capable position. During half-swording, the entirety of the sword works as a weapon, including the pommel and crossguard. One example how a sword can be used this way is to thrust the tip of the crossguard at the opponent&#x27;s head right after parrying a stroke. Another technique would be the Mordstreich (lit. &quot;murder stroke&quot;), where the weapon is held by the blade (hilt, pommel and crossguard serving as an improvised hammer head) and swung, taking advantage of the balance being close to the hilt to increase the concussive effect (see the fighter on the right of the Codex Wallerstein picture).

<text>Abandinus was a theonym used to refer to a Celtic god or male spirit worshipped in Godmanchester in Cambridgeshire during the Romano-Celtic period.

==Epigraphic evidence==
Abandinus is represented in Britain on a single altarstone. He is unknown throughout the rest of the Roman Empire and is therefore thought to have been a local god of the Roman fort at Godmanchester in Cambridgeshire, possibly associated with either a natural spring or a stream in the neighbourhood.

The Roman fort at Godmanchester, a strategic site on Ermine Street at the crossing of the River Great Ouse, is thought to have been called Durovigutum. The god is known only from an inscribed bronze feather, very likely some sort of votive object, dedicated to him.
The inscription on the bronze feather reads:
&quot;DEO ABANDINO VATIAVCVS D S D&quot;

*‘To the god Abandinus, Vatiacus dedicates this out of his own funds’.

==Semantics of the theonym==
The semantics of the theonym are unknown. All the same, linguistic knowledge of Proto-Celtic lexis permits a narrowing of the likely possibilities of the theonym&#x27;s semantics. The name could be interpreted as an extended form of a stem composed of Proto-Celtic elements deriving from Proto-Indo-European roots *&quot;ad&quot;- ‘to’ + either *&quot;bʰend&quot;- ‘sing, rejoice’ or *&quot;bʰendʰ&quot;- ‘bind’. Along these lines, the name would mean ‘(the god) who sings to (something/someone)’ or ‘(the god) who binds (something/someone) to (something/someone).’

However, it is also possible to see the name as an extended form of a variant form of the Proto-Celtic word *&quot;abon&quot;- ‘river,’ derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;ab&quot;-, *&quot;h₂eb-&quot; ‘water, river’. The shorter element *&quot;abo&quot;- likely existed in the Proto-Celtic hydronomy as a word for ‘river’ or ‘water.’ It is evident in Romano-Celtic as an unspecific variant name for the rivers flowing into the Humber, documented as &quot;Abus&quot;. This element developed in Modern Welsh as &quot;aber&quot;- meaning ‘river estuary’. This *&quot;abo&quot;- element could have been the source of the &quot;Ab-&quot;- element in the theonym &quot;Abandinus&quot;. So the name can also be analysed as *&quot;Ab-Andinus&quot; ‘Andinus of the River,’ Andinus being a theonym attested elsewhere in the ancient Roman Empire.

<text>Halfdan the Black (Old Norse: &quot;Halfdanr Svarti&quot;; ) was a king of Vestfold. He belonged to the House of Yngling and was the father of Harald Fairhair, the first king of a unified Norway.

==In sagas==

According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, Halfdan was the son of the Yngling King Gudrød the Hunter. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; also names his mother, as Åsa, daughter of King Harald of Agder, and his half-brother as Olaf Geirstad-Alf. Heimskringla relates that when Halfdan&#x27;s father was killed, Åsa took the 1 year-old Halfdan and returned to Agder, where Halfdan was raised. When he was 18 or 19 years old, Halfdan became king of Agder. He quickly began adding to his kingdom, through political negotiation and military conquest. He divided the kingdom of Vestfold with his brother Olaf and, through military action, persuaded King Gandalf of Vingulmark to cede half his kingdom. Based on the formulaic nature of his ties to his predecessors, his strong affiliation with Agder, and the failure of an early saga dedicated to him to name any family connections, some scholars have suggested that the linkage to the earlier Yngling dynasty of Vestfold was a later invention, created to associate a conquering Halfdan and his son Harald Fairhair with the family glorified in the &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, whom he had displaced.

Halfdan next is said to have subdued an area called Raumarike. To secure his claim to Raumarike, Halfdan first defeated and killed the previous ruler, Sigtryg Eysteinsson, in battle. He then defeated Sigtryg&#x27;s brother and successor Eystein, in a series of battles. This established Halfdan&#x27;s claim not only to Raumarike, but also to half of Hedmark, the core of Sigtryg and Eystein&#x27;s kingdom. These details are only mentioned in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

&quot;Fagrskinna&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; both agree that Halfdan&#x27;s first wife was Ragnhild, daughter of King Harald Gulskeg (Goldbeard) of Sogn. Halfdan and Ragnhild had a son named &quot;Harald&quot; after his grandfather, and they sent him to be raised at his grandfather&#x27;s court. Harald Gulskeg, being elderly, named his grandson as his successor, shortly before his death. Ragnhild died shortly after her father, and the young king Harald fell sick and died the next spring. When Halfdan heard about his son&#x27;s death, he travelled to Sogn and laid claim to the title of king. No resistance was offered, and Halfdan added Sogn to his realm.
The narrative in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; then adds another conquest for King Halfdan. In Vingulmark, the sons of Gandalf of Vingulmark, Hysing, Helsing, and Hake, attempted to ambush Halfdan at night, but he escaped into the forest. After raising an army, he returned to defeat the brothers, killing Hysing and Helsing. Hake fled the country, and Halfdan became king of all of Vingulmark.

According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Halfdan&#x27;s second wife, also named Ragnhild, had been kidnapped from her home by Hake, a &quot;berserker&quot; who encountered her father in Hadeland and killed him. Halfdan had her kidnapped from Hake, so that he could marry her. &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; does not mention any of these details. However, both sagas agree that Ragnhild and Halfdan had a son who was also named Harald. (Among the more unlikely claims in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; are that this woman was Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter, daughter of Sigurd Hjort, king of Ringerike. This would make Ragnhild the granddaughter or even great-granddaughter of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye – an impossibility, given that most sources suggest that Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye was active only in the &quot;late&quot; 9th century, which would mean that he was born a generation or two &quot;after&quot; Halfdan the Black.)

==Halvdanshaugen==

&quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;, &quot;Ágrip&quot; and &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; all relate that Halfdan drowned when he fell through the ice at the inlet Røykenvik in the lake Randsfjorden on his return home from Hadeland. His horse and sleigh broke through ice weakened by cattle dung near a watering hole dug in the frozen lake. He was buried in a mound at Stein in Ringerike (&quot;Halvdanshaugen på Stein&quot;).

&quot;Heimskringla&quot;&#x27;s narrative adds that each of the districts of his kingdom wanted to claim his grave, and that it was agreed to divide his body into four pieces so each district could bury a piece of it, resulting in four different sites called &quot;Halvdanshaugen&quot; (from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning mound). According to this version, only his head is buried in Ringerike.

==Sources==
No contemporary sources mention Halfdan, and the details of his life that are provided by later kings&#x27; sagas are considered semi-legendary by modern historians. Although he has his own saga in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, it lacks any skaldic verse, which is normally used by Snorri as supporting evidence and this, combined with its rather legendary character, leads historians to be wary of seeing much veracity in it. The &quot;Black&quot; nickname was given to him because of his black hair.

Halfdan is mentioned in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; (), &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; (), &quot;Ágrip&quot; () and &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; (late 12th century). The most elaborate story is found in the latest saga, &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. According to the Latin &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, Halvdan was a king &quot;in montanis&quot; (in the mountains), which is usually equivalent to Oppland in the Old Norse. This conflicts with the version told in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;.

Trained in the confectionery business, Hershey pioneered the manufacture of caramel, using fresh milk. He launched the Lancaster Caramel Company, which achieved bulk exports, and then sold it to start a new company supplying mass-produced milk chocolate, previously a luxury good.

The first Hershey bars were sold in 1900 and proved so popular that he was able to build his own company town of Hershey, Pennsylvania. Hershey&#x27;s philanthropy extended to a boarding school, originally for local orphans, but accommodating around 2,000 students as of 2016. In World War II, the company developed a special non-melting bar for troops serving overseas. The Hershey Company, known as Hershey&#x27;s, is one of the world&#x27;s biggest confectionery manufacturers.

==Early life==
Milton Hershey was born on September 13, 1857, to Henry and Veronica &quot;Fanny&quot; (née Snavely) Hershey. Of Swiss and German descent, his family were members of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Mennonite community, and he grew up speaking Pennsylvania Dutch.

In April 1862, Hershey&#x27;s sister Sarena Hershey was born in Derry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and died in 1867 at age 4.

Hershey had a very limited education, with no schooling beyond the 4th grade. In 1871, Milton Hershey left school and was apprenticed to a local printer, Sam Ernst, who published a German-English newspaper. He soon lost this job, and took up the candy trade after recommendation by his family. His mother arranged for the 14-year-old Hershey to be apprenticed to a confectioner named Joseph Royer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He studied under Royer for four years. In 1876, he moved to Philadelphia to start his first confectionery business.

Milton then traveled to Denver and, finding work at a local confectioners, learned how to make caramels using fresh milk. He then went to New Orleans and Chicago looking for opportunities, before settling in New York City in 1883 and training at Huyler&#x27;s. He started his second business which, while initially successful, lasted only three years, closing in 1886.

==Lancaster Caramel Company==
Hershey returned to Lancaster in 1883 and started the Lancaster Caramel Company, which became a success. By the early 1890s Lancaster Caramel Company had begun employing over 1,300 workers in two factories. After traveling to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Hershey became interested in chocolate. He sold Lancaster Caramel Company for $1 million to start the Hershey Chocolate Company.

==The Hershey Chocolate Company==
Using the proceeds from the 1900 sale of the Lancaster Caramel Company, Hershey initially acquired farm land roughly northwest of Lancaster, near his birthplace of Derry Township. He created his own formula, and the first Hershey bar was produced in 1900. Hershey&#x27;s Kisses were developed in 1907, and the Hershey&#x27;s Bar with almonds was introduced in 1908.

The factory was in the center of a dairy farmland, but with Hershey&#x27;s support, houses, businesses, churches and a transportation infrastructure accreted around the factory. The area around the factory eventually became known as the company town of Hershey, Pennsylvania.

==Philanthropy==
Hershey and his wife established the Hershey Industrial School with a Deed of Trust in 1909.

In 1918, Hershey transferred the majority of his assets, including control of the company, to the Milton Hershey School Trust fund, to benefit the Industrial School. The trust fund has a majority of voting shares in the Hershey Company, allowing it to keep control of the company. In 1951, the school was renamed the Milton Hershey School. The Milton Hershey School Trust also has 100% control of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, which owns the Hotel Hershey and Hersheypark, among other properties.

Hershey built Hershey Cemetery on Laudermilch Road in Hershey, Pennsylvania. On July 31, 1923, Hershey transferred the land into a cemetery for $1.00.

In 1935, Hershey established the M.S. Hershey Foundation, a private charitable foundation that provides educational and cultural opportunities for Hershey residents. The foundation supplies funding for three entities: the Hershey Museum and Hershey Gardens, the Hershey Theatre and the Hershey Community Archives.

The founding of the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center occurred in 1963 when the board of the trust went to the Dauphin County Orphans Court with the &quot;cy-près doctrine&quot; (&quot;cy près&quot; is a French phrase meaning &quot;As close as possible&quot;). It was a gift from the Milton Hershey School Trust to the people of Pennsylvania, with an initial endowment of $50 million and only one restriction—the hospital had to be built in Hershey. The hospital is a teaching hospital, with an annual budget exceeding the initial construction cost.

==Close call of the &quot;Titanic&quot;==
In 1912, the Hersheys were booked to travel on the maiden voyage of the British luxury liner RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. They canceled their reservations at the last minute due to business matters requiring Hershey&#x27;s attention. The cancellation is often incorrectly attributed to Kitty Hershey falling ill, but by this time, she had been ill for several years. Instead, they booked passage to New York on the German luxury liner &quot;SS Amerika&quot;. The former Hershey Museum displayed a copy of the check Milton Hershey wrote to the White Star Line as a deposit for a first-class stateroom on the &quot;Titanic&quot;. This copy is now located in the archives of the Hershey Story Museum, which replaced the original Hershey Museum in 2009.

==World War II==
Hershey Chocolate supplied the U.S. Armed Forces with chocolate bars during World War II. These bars were called Ration D Bars and Tropical Chocolate Bars. The Ration D Bar had very specific requirements from the army: It had to weigh ; it had to resist melting at temperatures higher than , and it had to have an unpleasant-enough flavor to prevent the troops from developing cravings for them. After a year or two, the Army was impressed enough with the durability and success of the Ration D Bar to commission Hershey to make the Tropical Chocolate Bar. The only difference between them was that the Tropical Chocolate Bar was made to taste better than the Ration D Bar and still be as durable. Tropical Chocolate Bars were designed not to melt in the tropical weather. It is estimated that between 1940 and 1945, over three billion of the Ration D and Tropical Chocolate Bars were produced and distributed to soldiers throughout the world. In 1939, the Hershey plant was capable of producing 100,000 ration bars a day. By the end of World War II, the entire Hershey plant was producing ration bars at a rate of 24 million a week. For its service throughout World War II, the Hershey Chocolate Company was issued five Army-Navy &#x27;E&#x27; Production Awards for exceeding expectations for quality and quantity in the production of the Ration D and Tropical Chocolate Bars. The Hershey factory machine shop even made some parts for tanks and machines during the war.

== Personal life ==
On May 25, 1898, Hershey married Catherine Elizabeth &quot;Kitty&quot; Sweeney (b. 1871), an Irish-American Catholic from Jamestown, New York. The couple did not have any children.

On March 25, 1915, Catherine died of an unknown disease.
In 1919, Hershey moved Catherine&#x27;s body from Philadelphia to Hershey Cemetery.
In March 1920, Hershey&#x27;s mother, Fanny Hershey, died and she was buried in Hershey Cemetery. In late 1930, his father&#x27;s body was moved there.

=== Death ===
Hershey died of pneumonia in Hershey Hospital on October 13, 1945, at the age of 88.
Hershey is buried at Hershey Cemetery, a cemetery which he built, on Laudermilch Rd in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Hershey&#x27;s grave is located at Section Spec-Her, Lot 1, Grave 1, next to his wife (Grave 2).

== Legacy ==
At the Hershey School, there is a bronze statue of Milton Hershey with an orphan boy wrapped in his arms. Below the statue are these words: &quot;His deeds are his monument. His life is our inspiration.&quot;

Hershey&#x27;s birthday, September 13, is one of several competing dates celebrated as International Chocolate Day.

On September 13, 1995, the United States Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp for Milton S. Hershey, which honors him as a philanthropist, as part of the Great Americans series. The stamp was designed by Dennis Lyall, an artist from Norwalk, Connecticut.

<doc id="85868" wikidata="Q318682" url="?curid=85868" title="Abellio">
<text>Abellio (also Abelio and Abelionni) was a god worshiped in the Garonne Valley in Gallia Aquitania (now southwest France), known primarily by a number of inscriptions which were discovered in Comminges, in the Pyrenees. He may have been a god of apple trees or the sun.

== Origin and duties ==
Abellio is accounted for in two Roman inscriptions, one spelling the deity Abellio and the other Abelio.

Some scholars have postulated that Abellio is the same name as Apollo, who in Crete and elsewhere was called &quot;Abelios&quot; (Greek ), and by the Italians and some Dorians &quot;Apello&quot;, and that the deity is the same as the Gallic Apollo mentioned by Caesar, and also the same as the Belis or Belenus mentioned by Tertullian and Herodian.

Other scholars have taken the reverse position that Abellio might have been a similar solar deity of Celtic origin in Crete and the Pyrenees, but the Cretan Abellio may however not be the same god as the Celtic one, but rather a different manifestation, or dialectal form, of the Greek god Apollo or his name.

In his attempt to connect the Grail legends to the Cathars, Otto Rahn identified the worship of Abellio in the Pyrenees with the Latinized form of Belenus-Apollo whom he equated with Lucifer.

Though some scholars have tried to identify this god as Greek or Celtic, the fact is that the theonym Abellio is only attested among the Aquitani, a people neither Greek nor Celtic. There are three other attested Ballio names in the Roman Empire, all of them anthroponyms and without final N: one in South Italy, and two in Ancient Dalmatia.

<doc id="85870" wikidata="Q322585" url="?curid=85870" title="Abnoba">
<text>Abnoba is a name with theological and geographical meanings: It is the name of a Gaulish goddess who was worshiped in the Black Forest and surrounding areas. It is also the name of a mountain or mountain range.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the theonym is uncertain. It has been associated with the etymon *&quot;abo-s&quot; &quot;water, river&quot;, found in e.g. Avon (&quot;*abonā&quot;). The second element has been connected to either a PIE *&quot;nogʷo-&quot;, either &quot;naked, nude&quot; or &quot;tree&quot;, or with the verbal root *&quot;nebh-&quot; &quot;burst out, be damp&quot;.

==Celtic polytheism==
Abnoba has been interpreted to be a forest and river goddess, and is known from about nine epigraphic inscriptions. One altar at the Roman baths at Badenweiler, Germany, and another at Mühlenbach identify her with Diana, the Roman goddess of the hunt.

==Geography==

Abnoba, sometimes spelt Arnoba or Arbona, has been used to refer to a mountain range comprising the Odenwald, Spessart, and Baar mountains. This composite range extends from the Rhine to the Neckar, and is referred to by one of the various names listed depending on the region it is passing through.

According to Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot;, Abnoba was the name of a mountain, from a grassy slope of which flows the source of the River Danube.
Pliny the Elder also gives us some statements about Abnoba (&quot;Natural History&quot;, 4.79). He says that it arises opposite the town of Rauricum in Gaul and flows from there beyond the Alps, implying that the river begins in the Alps, which it does not. If Rauricum is to be identified with the Roman settlement, Augusta Raurica, modern Augst in Basel-Landschaft canton of Switzerland, Pliny must be confusing the Rhine and its tributaries with the Danube.

The Danube begins with two small rivers draining the Black Forest: the Breg and the Brigach, both Celtic names. The longest is the most favorable candidate: the Breg. The Abnobaei montes would therefore be the Baar foothills of the Swabian Alb near Furtwangen im Schwarzwald.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2.10) also mentions the mountain range, but incorrectly implies a position north of the Agri Decumates and Main river. It has been suggested that this error comes about through the use of differing and imperfect sources to make this section of the Geography. In effect Ptolemy has apparently confused the Abnoba with the Roman border, and therefore with what are today called the Taunus mountains.

<text>Achall, daughter of Cairbre Nia Fer, king of Tara, and his wife Fedelm Noíchrothach, is a minor character from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. After her brother Erc was killed by Conall Cernach, she died of grief on a hill near Tara, which was named Achall after her.

The legendary High King of Ireland Túathal Techtmar is said to have taken power after defeating the previous High King, Elim mac Conrach, in battle on the hill of Achall. According to &quot;The Expulsion of the Déisi&quot;, another legendary High King, Cormac mac Airt, lived on the hill of Achall after he lost an eye, his physical imperfection meaning he could no longer rule at Tara. The hill is now known as Skryne.

<text>Conn Cétchathach (), or Conn of the Hundred Battles, son of Fedlimid Rechtmar, was a legendary High King of Ireland who is claimed to be the ancestor of the Connachta, and through his descendant Niall Noígiallach, the Uí Néill dynasties, which dominated Ireland in the early Middle Ages.

==Literary tradition==
===Early life and accession===
The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; says that five roads to Tara, which had never been seen before, were discovered on the night of Conn&#x27;s birth. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, he took power after killing his predecessor Cathair Mór. In other sources his predecessor is Dáire Doimthech. The &quot;Lia Fáil&quot;, the coronation stone at Tara which was said to roar when the rightful king stood on it, roared under Conn for the first time since Cúchulainn split it with his sword when it failed to roar for Lugaid Riab nDerg.

In the saga &quot;Baile in Scáil&quot; (&quot;The Phantom&#x27;s Ecstatic Vision&quot;), Conn treads on the stone by accident while walking the ramparts of Tara, implying that the stone had been lost and half-buried since Cúchulainn&#x27;s time. A druid explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon. Then they see a phantom, a tall beautiful man, on a throne, who introduces himself as Lugh. The woman is the sovereignty of Ireland, and she serves Conn a meal consisting of an ox&#x27;s rib , and a boar&#x27;s rib. When she serves drinks, she asks &quot;To whom shall this cup be given?&quot;, and Lugh recites a poem which tells Conn how many years he will reign, and the names of the kings who will follow him. Then they enter Lugh&#x27;s shadow, and the house disappears, but the cup and serving spoon remain.

An earlier text, &quot;Baile Chuinn Cétchathaigh&quot; (&quot;The Ecstatic Vision of Conn of the Hundred Battles&quot;) gives a poetic list of kings, many of which are recognisable from the traditional List of High Kings of Ireland, but without narrative context.

===Reign===
Conn had a long reign – twenty, twenty-five, thirty-five or even fifty years according to different versions of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, spending much of it at war with Mug Nuadat, king of Munster.

According to the medieval text &quot;Cath Maige Leana&quot; (&quot;the battle of Mag Leana&quot;), Mug Nuadat&#x27;s father, Mug Neit son of Deirgtine, had expelled the kings of Munster, Conaire Coem and Mac Niad mac Lugdach. The two kings fled to Conn, and married his daughters, Saraid and Sadb respectively. Mug Neit made war on Conn, but was defeated and killed after two battles in County Offaly. Mug Nuadat led his father&#x27;s forces in retreat through Munster, fighting Conn to a standstill before escaping by sea to Beare Island (in Irish, &quot;Oiléan Béarra,&quot; now called Bere Island), and thence to Spain. Conn restored Conaire and Mac Niad to their kingdoms and withdrew.

Nine years later, Mug Nuadat, who had married the daughter of the king of Spain, landed with an army near Bantry Bay and forced Conaire and Mac Niad to submit to his overlordship. With the kings of Ulster and Leinster, he marched north to Mag nAi and forced Conn to make a treaty with him, dividing Ireland between them: Conn controlling the north, or &quot;Leth Cuinn&quot; (&quot;Conn&#x27;s half&quot;), and Mug Nuadat the south, or &quot;Leth Moga&quot; (&quot;Mug&#x27;s half&quot;), with the border running from Galway in the west to Dublin in the east.

After fifteen years of peace, Mug Nuadat broke the treaty and declared war, along with the kings of Ulster and Leinster. He led his army to Mag Leana, near Tullamore, County Offaly. Conn retreated to Connacht, gathered his forces, and retook Meath from the king of Ulster. He then marched south to Mag Leana and destroyed Mug Nuadat&#x27;s army in a surprise night attack on his camp. Mug Nuadat was killed in the fighting, and Conn became king of all of Ireland.

Geoffrey Keating tells the story differently. In his account, Mug Nuadat obtains an army from the king of Leinster and expels the kings of Munster, here Lugaid Allathach, Dáire Dornmhor and Aonghus. Aonghus flees to Conn, who gives him an army with which to reclaim his kingdom, but Mug Nuadat defeats this and a further nine attempts by Conn to drive him out of Munster, forcing Conn to divide Ireland with him. When hostilities break out again, Conn and Mug Nuadat&#x27;s armies gather for battle at Mag Lena, but Conn kills Mug Nuadat in his bed in an early morning attack.

According to a medieval source, the hero Fionn mac Cumhaill was born in Conn&#x27;s time. His father, Cumhall, a warrior in Conn&#x27;s service, was a suitor of Muirne, daughter of the druid Tadg mac Nuadat, but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by Goll mac Morna in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall&#x27;s brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal&#x27;s house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn. When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn&#x27;s service. He learned that every year at Samhain, the monster Aillen would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen&#x27;s flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the &quot;fianna&quot; in place of Goll.

===Family===
Conn had two sons, Connla and Art. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from Mag Mell, and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as &quot;Óenfer&quot; – the &quot;lone&quot; or &quot;solitary&quot;. Connla&#x27;s tale is told in the &quot;Echtra Condla&quot;.

After Conn&#x27;s wife Eithne Tháebfhota, daughter of Cathair Mór, died, another fairy woman, Bé Chuille, was banished by the Tuatha Dé Danann to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her currach, but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was Bé Chuille&#x27;s fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in Bé Chuille&#x27;s currach. He landed on a strange island of apple trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put Bé Chuille away, but he refused. Bé Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of &quot;fidchell&quot;.

===Death===
Conn was eventually killed by Tipraite Tírech, king of the Ulaid, on Tuesday 20 October according to Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh in his &#x27;Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia&#x27; (1685). The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, Baile in Scáil, Gilla Cóemáin&#x27;s poem &quot;Annalad annall uile&quot;, Fland Mainistrech&#x27;s poem &quot;Rig Themra dia tesband tnú&quot; in the Book of Leinster and the &quot;Annals&quot; all say Tipraite defeated him in battle in Túath Amrois. Keating and the Great Book of Lecan says Tipraite sent fifty warriors dressed as women from Emain Macha to kill him at Tara. &quot;The decision as to Cormac’s sword&quot; says Conn was killed with a sword that once belonged to Cú Chulainn. &quot;Cath Maighe Léna&quot; states that the name of the hill where Conn was killed was Druim Tuirléime. His son-in-law Conaire Cóem succeeded him as High King, and Conn&#x27;s son Art would later succeed him. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; synchronises Conn&#x27;s reign with that of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (161–180). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates his reign to 116–136, that of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 122–157.

<doc id="85874" wikidata="Q12758" url="?curid=85874" title="Seine-Maritime">
<text>Seine-Maritime () is a department of France in the Normandy region of northern France. It is situated on the northern coast of France, at the mouth of the Seine, and includes the cities of Rouen and Le Havre. Until 1955 it was named Seine-Inférieure. It had a population of 1,255,633 in 2019.

== History ==

;1790 - Creation of the Seine-Inférieure department
:The department was created from part of the old province of Normandy during the French Revolution, on 4 March 1790, through the application of a law of 22 December 1789.

;1815 - Occupation
:After the victory at Waterloo of the coalition armies, the department was occupied by British forces from June 1815 till November 1818.

;1843 – Railways and industry
:In Rouen, Elbeuf, and Bolbec, the number of textile factories is increasing. Metallurgy and naval construction as well.

;1851 - A republican department
:Following President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s 1851 Coup d&#x27;état, Seine-Inférieure was one of several departments placed under a state of emergency (literally, in French, &quot;state of siege)&quot; following fears of significant resistance to the new government.

; World War II
:In 1942, during occupation by Nazi Germany, two Allied raids, the Bruneval and Dieppe, took place at towns of the channel coast of Seine-Inférieure.

;1955 - Rename to Seine-Maritime
In 1955, the department&#x27;s name was officially changed to Seine-Maritime.

=== Heraldry ===
== Geography ==
The department can be split into three main areas:
* The Seine valley. The Seine flows through the provincial capital Rouen.
* The chalk plateau Pays de Caux, with its abrupt coastline (the Alabaster Coast). 
* The Norman Pays de Bray, with its hills and bocage landscape.

===Administration===
The département was created in 1790 as Seine-Inférieure, one of five departements that replaced the former province of Normandy. In 1800 five arrondissements were created within the département, namely Rouen, Le Havre, Dieppe, Neufchatel and Yvetot, although the latter two were disbanded in 1926. On 18 January 1955 the name of the département was changed to Seine-Maritime, in order to provide a more positive-sounding name and in-keeping with changes made in a number of other French departements.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Le Havre; the prefecture Rouen is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 7 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==

Previously lacking a demonym, the inhabitants of Seine-Maritime (as the department had been renamed in 1955) chose, following a public consultation, to be identified in official documents as &quot;Seinomarins&quot; (males) and &quot;Seinomarines&quot; (females).

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Bertrand Bellanger, elected in 2019.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===
===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Transport==
In 1843 the railway from Paris reached the region.
The département is connected to the adjacent Eure department via the Tancarville and Pont de Normandie bridge crossings of the Seine.

&quot;Madame Bovary&quot; by Gustave Flaubert is set in Seine Maritime.

The novel &quot;La Place&quot; by Annie Ernaux largely takes place in Seine-Maritime and describes events and changes that take place in relation to French society in the 20th century especially in relation to the rural population.

The first story of the long-running series &quot;Valérian and Laureline&quot; is set in Seine-Maritime, with the character Laureline originating from the area.

Cauchois is the dialect of the Pays de Caux, and is one of the most vibrant forms of the Norman language beyond Cotentinais.

<text>Cormac mac [[Art mac Cuinn|Airt]], also known as Cormac ua Cuinn (grandson of Conn) or Cormac Ulfada (long beard), was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He is probably the most famous of the ancient High Kings, and may have been an authentic historical figure, although many legends have attached themselves to him, and his reign is variously dated as early as the 2nd century and as late as the 4th. He is said to have ruled from Tara, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland, for forty years, and under his rule, Tara flourished. He is credited for building many of the monuments at the Hill of Tara such as the Banqueting Hall, Cormac&#x27;s house, and Gráinne&#x27;s Enclosure, named after his daughter. He was famous for his wise, true, and generous judgments. In the Annals of Clonmacnoise, translated in 1627, he is described as:
The hero Fionn mac Cumhaill is supposed to have lived in Cormac&#x27;s time, and most of the stories of the Fenian Cycle are set during his reign.

==Birth and childhood==
Cormac&#x27;s father was the former High King Art mac Cuinn. His mother was Achtan, daughter of Olc Acha, a smith (or druid) from Connacht. Cormac had a younger brother, Alastir.

According to the saga &quot;The Battle of Mag Mucrama&quot;, Olc gave Art hospitality the night before the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe. It had been prophesied that a great dignity would come from Olc&#x27;s line, so he offered the High King his daughter to sleep with that night, and Cormac was conceived (Geoffrey Keating says that Achtan was Art&#x27;s official mistress, to whom he had given a dowry of cattle).

The story is told that Achtan had a vision as she slept next to Art. She saw herself with her head cut off and a great tree growing out of her neck. Its branches spread all over Ireland, until the sea rose and overwhelmed it. Another tree grew from the roots of the first, but the wind blew it down. At that, she woke up and told Art what she had seen. Art explained that the head of every woman is her husband, and that she would lose her husband in battle the next day. The first tree was their son, who would be king over all Ireland, and the sea that overwhelmed it was a fishbone that he would die choking on. The second tree was his son, Cairbre Lifechair, who would be king after him, and the wind that blew him down was a battle against the &quot;fianna&quot;, in which he would fall. The following day Art was defeated and killed by his nephew Lugaid mac Con, who became the new High King.

Cormac was carried off in infancy by a she-wolf and reared with her cubs in the caves of Kesh (Keash, Co Sligo), but a hunter found him and brought him back to his mother. Achtan then took him to Fiachrae Cassán, who had been Art&#x27;s foster father. On the way, they were attacked by wolves, but wild horses protected them.

==Rise to power==
At the age of thirty, armed with his father&#x27;s sword, Cormac came to Tara, where he met a steward consoling a weeping woman. The steward explained that the High King had confiscated her sheep because they had cropped the queen&#x27;s woad garden. Cormac declared, &quot;More fitting would be one shearing for another,&quot; because both the woad and the sheep&#x27;s fleeces would grow again. When Lugaid heard this, he conceded that Cormac&#x27;s judgement was superior to his and abdicated the throne. Other traditions say that Cormac drove Lugaid out by force, or that he left Tara because his druids had prophesied he would not live another six months if he stayed. In all versions he went to his kin in Munster, where the poet Ferches mac Commain killed him with a spear as he stood with his back to a standing stone.

But Cormac was unable to claim the High Kingship, as the king of the Ulaid, Fergus Dubdétach, drove him into Connacht, and took the throne himself. He turned to Tadg mac Céin, a local nobleman whose father had been killed by Fergus, promising him as much land on the plain of Brega as he could drive his chariot round in a day if he would help him claim the throne. Tadg advised him to recruit his grandfather&#x27;s brother Lugaid Láma. Cormac sought him out, and when he found him lying in a hunting booth, wounded him in the back with a spear. Lugaid revealed that it had been he who had killed Cormac&#x27;s father in the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe, and Cormac demanded, as &quot;éraic&quot; for Art&#x27;s life, that Lugaid give him Fergus&#x27; head.

Having recruited Tadg and Lugaid, Cormac marched against Fergus, and The Battle of Crinna began. Tadg led the battle, keeping Cormac out of the action at the rear. Lugaid took the head of Fergus&#x27; brother, Fergus Foltlebair, and brought it to Cormac&#x27;s attendant, who told him this was not the head of the king of Ulster. He then took the head of Fergus&#x27;s other brother, Fergus Caisfhiachlach, but again the attendant told him it was the wrong head. Finally, he killed Fergus Dubdétach himself, and when the attendant confirmed he&#x27;d got the right man, Lugaid killed him and collapsed from exhaustion and loss of blood.

Tadg routed Fergus&#x27;s army, and ordered his charioteer to make a circuit of the plain of Brega to include Tara itself. He was severely wounded, and fainted during the circuit. When he came to, he asked the charioteer if he had driven around Tara yet. When the charioteer answered no, Tadg killed him, but before he could complete the circuit himself, Cormac came upon him and ordered physicians to treat his wounds - treatment which took a whole year. Cormac took the throne, and Tadg ruled large tracts of land in the northern half of Ireland.

==Family==
According to the saga &quot;The Melody of the House of Buchet&quot;, Cormac married Eithne Táebfada, daughter of Cathaír Mór and foster-daughter of Buchet, a wealthy cattle-lord from Leinster whose hospitality was so exploited that he was reduced to poverty. However, in other traditions, Eithne is the wife of Cormac&#x27;s grandfather Conn Cétchathach. Keating says the foster daughter of Buchet that Cormac married was another Eithne, Eithne Ollamda, daughter of Dúnlaing, king of Leinster. Also according to Keating, Cormac took a second wife, Ciarnait, daughter of the king of the Cruthin, but Eithne, out of jealousy of her beauty, forced her to grind nine measures of grain every day. Cormac freed her from this labour by having a watermill built.

Cormac&#x27;s sons, Dáire, Cellach, Anlach and Cairbre Lifechair, and ten daughters. Two of his daughters, Gráinne and Aillbe, married the hero Fionn mac Cumhaill. In the well-known story &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;, Gráinne was betrothed to Fionn, but instead ran off with a young warrior of the &quot;fianna&quot;, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Diarmuid and Fionn were eventually reconciled, but Fionn later contrived Diarmuid&#x27;s death during a boar hunt, but was shamed by his son Oisín into making amends to Gráinne. Fionn and Gráinne were married, and Gráinne persuaded her sons not to make war against Fionn.

==Reign==
Cormac&#x27;s reign is recorded in some detail in the Irish annals. He fought many battles, subduing the Ulaid and Connacht and leading a lengthy campaign against Munster. In the fourteenth year of his reign, he is said to have sailed to Britain and made conquests there. In the fifteenth, thirty maidens were slaughtered in Tara by Dúnlaing, king of Leinster, for which Cormac had twelve Leinster princes put to death. In other texts, he is said to have been temporarily deposed twice by the Ulaid, and to have once gone missing for four months. He is also said to have compiled the Psalter of Tara, a book containing the chronicles of Irish history, the laws concerning the rents and dues kings were to receive from their subjects, and records of the boundaries of Ireland.

Although he is usually remembered as a wise and just ruler, one story presents him in a less flattering light. Having distributed all the cattle he had received as tribute from the provinces, Cormac found himself without any cattle to provision his own household after a plague struck his herds. A steward persuaded him to treat Munster as two provinces, the southern of which had never paid tax. He sent messengers to demand payment, but Fiachu Muillethan, the king of southern Munster, refused, and Cormac prepared for war. His own druids, who had never advised him badly, foresaw disaster, but he ignored them, preferring to listen to five druids from the &quot;sidhe&quot; supplied by his fairy lover, Báirinn.

Cormac marched to Munster and made camp on the hill of Druim Dámhgaire (Knocklong, County Limerick). His new druids&#x27; magic made the camp impregnable and his warriors unbeatable, dried up all sources of water used by the Munstermen, and nearly drove Fiacha to submission. But Fiacha in desperation turned to the powerful Munster druid Mug Ruith for aid, and his magic was too strong even for Cormac&#x27;s fairy druids. He restored the water and conjured up magical hounds who destroyed the fairy druids. His breath created storms and turned men to stone. Cormac was driven out of Munster and compelled to seek terms.

In the tale &quot;Echtra Cormaic&quot; (Lady Gregory, GAFM IV.11 &quot;His Three Calls to Cormac&quot; ) the Irish King is tempted by the sea-god Manannan mac Lir with treasure, specifically a &quot;shining branch having nine apples of red gold,&quot; in exchange for his family. Cormac is led into the Otherworld (Land of Promise) and taught a harsh lesson by Manannán, but in the end, his wife and children are restored to him. Also, Manannán rewards him with a wonderful gold cup which breaks if three lies are spoken over it and is made whole again if three truths are spoken. Cormac used this cup during his kingship to distinguish falsehood from truth. When Cormac died, the cup vanished, just as Manannan had predicted it would.

The 8th-century text &quot;The Expulsion of the Déisi&quot; describes enmity between Cormac and the group known as the Déisi, descendants of Cormac&#x27;s great-grandfather Fedlimid Rechtmar who had been his retainers. Cormac&#x27;s son Cellach (or Conn) abducts Forach, the daughter of a Déisi leader. Her uncle Óengus Gaíbúaibthech comes to rescue her, but Cellach refuses to release her. Óengus runs Cellach through with his &quot;dread spear&quot;, which has three chains attached to it; these chains wound one of Cormac&#x27;s advisers and blind Cormac in one eye. Cormac fights seven battles against the Déisi, and expels them from their lands. After a period of wandering, they settled in Munster. Cormac, having lost an eye, moves into the Tech Cletig on the hill of Achall, as it was against the law for a disfigured king to sit in Tara. His duties as king are taken on by his son Cairbre Lifechair.

==Death==
After ruling for forty years, Cormac choked to death on a salmon bone. Some versions blame this on a curse laid by a druid because Cormac had converted to Christianity. Some versions of the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; synchronise his reign with that of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (161–180). Keating dates his reign to 204–244; the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 226–266. An entry in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; dates his death as late as 366. He was succeeded by Eochaid Gonnat.

<text>Cormac is a masculine given name in the Irish and English languages. The name is ancient in the Irish language and is also seen in the rendered Old Norse as &quot;Kormákr&quot;.

Mac is Irish for &quot;son&quot;, and can be used as either a prefix or a suffix. The derivation of &quot;cor&quot; is not so clear. The most popular speculation is that it is from &quot;corb,&quot; the old Irish for wheel, perhaps designating someone who fought in a cart or chariot as male names are often derived from the order of battle. (For instance &quot;Gary, Garth, etc., from &quot;gar&quot; for &quot;spear.&quot;) However, some etymologies suggest it derives from the old Irish for &quot;raven&quot;, a bird laden with mystical meaning for the Celts, and often used to mean &quot;legend&quot; or &quot;legendary&quot;. Similarly, it might refer specifically to Corb, one of the legendary Fomorians of Irish mythology. Today the name is typically listed in baby names books as meaning &quot;raven&quot; or &quot;legend&quot; or sometimes as &quot;charioteer&quot;.

<text>Art mac Cuinn (&quot;son of Conn&quot;), also known as Art Óenfer (literally &quot;one man&quot;, used in the sense of &quot;lone&quot;, &quot;solitary&quot;, or &quot;only son&quot;), was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland.

==Siblings==
According to the legend, &quot;Echtra Condla&quot;, he was not Conn&#x27;s only son: he had a brother called Connla, who fell in love with a fairy woman, and went with her to Mag Mell, never to be seen again. After that, Art was alone and gained his nickname, &quot;Art Óenfer&quot;. Geoffrey Keating says he had two brothers, Connla and Crionna, who were killed by their uncle Eochaid Finn.

==Biography==
Another fairy woman, Bé Chuille/Bechuma, who had been banished to Ireland by the Tuatha Dé Danann, fell in love with Art, but, when she learned his father Conn was still alive and a widower, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The injustice caused famine in Ireland, until Art forced Bé Chuille to leave as a forfeit in a game of &quot;fidchell&quot;. In another variant of the myth, Bé Chuille places a geis on Art, after he loses at a game of fidchell; under which he must leave Ireland never to return until he can find and rescue the maiden Delbchaem (&quot;Fair Shape&quot;). Art travels to the Land of Wonder, facing untold dangers and is forced to kill Delbchaem&#x27;s mother a fearsome and supernatural figure, who has been foretold by druids that she would be killed by a suitor of her daughter. When Art and Delbchaem return to Tara, Delbchaem banishes Bé Chuille from the land, returning fertility to the region.

Art succeeded to the High Kingship after his brother-in-law Conaire Cóem, was killed by Nemed, son of Sroibcenn, in the battle of Gruitine. He ruled for twenty or thirty years. During his reign Conaire&#x27;s sons took revenge against Nemed and his allies, the sons of Ailill Aulom, in the Battle of Cennfebrat in Munster. Ailill&#x27;s foster-son Lugaid mac Con was wounded in the thigh in the battle, and was exiled from Ireland. He made an alliance with Benne Brit, son of the king of Britain, raised an army of foreigners, and returned to Ireland. He defeated and killed Art in the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe in Connacht. According to legend, Art was given hospitality by Olc Acha, a local smith, the night before the battle. It had been prophesied that a great dignity would come from Olc&#x27;s line, and he gave Art his daughter Achtan to sleep with. Art&#x27;s son Cormac was conceived that night. However, according to Keating, Achtan was Art&#x27;s official mistress, to whom he paid a dowry of cattle; his wife, and the mother of his other children, was Medb Lethderg.

The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; synchronises Art&#x27;s reign with that of the Roman emperor Commodus (180–192). The chronology of Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates his reign to 143–173, that of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 165–195.

<text>&#x27; or &#x27;, also known as  (&#x27;son of the Sea&#x27;), is a sea god, warrior, and king of the otherworld in Gaelic (Irish, Manx, and Scottish) mythology who is one of the .

He is seen as a ruler and guardian of the otherworld, and his dominion is referred by such names as (or , &#x27;Isle of Apple Trees&#x27;), (&#x27;Plain of Delights&#x27;), or (&#x27;Land of Promise&#x27;). He is described as over-king of the surviving Tuatha Dé after the advent of humans (Milesians), and uses the mist of invisibility () to cloak the whereabouts of his home as well as the dwellings of the others.

In modern tales, he is said to own a self-navigating boat named (&#x27;Wave-sweeper&#x27;), a horse which can course over water as well as land, and a deadly strength-sapping sword named , though the list does not end there.

 appears also in Scottish and Manx legend, where he is known as (&#x27;little Manannan, son of the Sea&#x27;). The Isle of Man () is generally thought to be named after him, though some have said he is named after the island. He is cognate with the Welsh figure .

== Names ==

Some of the names equated with include:

* ( means &#x27;great warrior&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Boyservant&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Troublesome Boyservant&#x27;)

===Etymology===
According to some, his name is derived from the Isle of Man with the suffix indicating &#x27;one who is from&#x27; the named place. The island&#x27;s name itself may come from a Celtic word for &#x27;mountain&#x27; or &#x27;rise&#x27;, as the Isle of Man rises from the sea on the horizon. Alternatively, it may come from an earlier Proto-Indo-European root for &#x27;water&#x27; or &#x27;wetness&#x27;. In medieval Irish tradition, it appears that Manannán came to be considered eponymous to the island (rather than vice versa).

=== Surname and Epithets ===
The most common epithets for reinforce his association with war and the sea. means &#x27;son of the Sea&#x27; or &#x27;son of &#x27;, a sea god whose name means &#x27;Sea&#x27;.

It has been suggested that his mythological father &#x27;s role as sea god was taken over by . &#x27;s other surname or means &#x27;son of the Soil/Land&#x27;, so that Manannán is effectively son of the sea and land.

== In Irish mythology ==
 appears in all of the cycles of Irish mythology, although he only plays a prominent role in a limited number of tales.
*In the Ulster Cycle: (&#x27;The Wooing of Étaín&#x27;), (&#x27;The Wasting Sickness of &#x27; or &#x27;The Sickbed of &#x27;), (&#x27;The Wooing of &#x27;)
*In the Cycles of the Kings: (&#x27;The Voyage of son of &#x27;), (&#x27;The Adventure of &#x27;), (&#x27;The Birth of &#x27;)
*In the Mythological Cycle: (&#x27;The Book of Invasions&#x27;), First Recension; (&#x27;The Nourishment of the Houses of Two Milk-vessels&#x27;)
*other Old Irish texts: (&quot;s Glossary&#x27;)

In the Ulster Cycle tale &quot;The Wasting Sickness of &quot; , &#x27;s wife, , has an ill-fated affair with the warrior . When sees that &#x27;s jealous wife, , is worthy of him (and accompanied by a troop of armed women), she decides to return to , who then shakes his cloak () of forgetfulness between and which causes them not be able to remember each other.

=== Characteristics ===
 rode his chariot over the sea, meeting with and his crew sailing by ship, in the tale &quot;The Voyage of son of &quot;, considered an early work. In this story, he told that sea was not actually water to him but rather &quot;I [] see in the Plain of Feats red topped flowers without fault&quot;. He goes on to tell Bran about how he is heading to Ireland to have relations with Caintigern who would go on to bear .

In late sources, visits the land of the living, his movement is compared to the wind, a hawk or swallow, and sometimes takes the form of a thundering wheel rolling across the landscape, such as in the &quot;Pursuit of the &quot;, a 16th-century comic tale. There is also the local lore that moved like a wheel turning on his three legs, a tradition widespread on the Isle of Man, but also found in some eastern counties of Leinster according to John O&#x27;Donovan, though this folklore was unfamiliar to Whitley Stokes.

====Abode====
 is lord and guardian of the Blessed Isles, (&#x27;Isle of Apple-trees&#x27;, cognate with the Avalon of the Welsh Arthurian cycle), and or (&#x27;Plain of Delights&#x27;). Manannán sings a verse describing his sea as , in &quot;The Voyage of &quot;, stating that the steeds on the plain cannot be seen, thus alluding to his concealment of his dwelling using the shroud of invisibility (). was the place of origin of the Silver Branch brought to .

 is also said to dwell in the Land of Promise (), as in the tale &quot;The Adventure of&quot;.

====Over-king====
An over-king&#x27;s role for Manannán among the Tuatha Dé Danann is described in the narrative &quot;Altram Tige Dá Medar&quot; (&#x27;The Nourishment of the Houses of Two Milk-vessels&#x27;) in the 14th to the 15th century manuscript, the &quot;Book of Fermoy&quot;. Máire MacNeill gave a summary of the work.

After the Tuatha Dé Danann were defeated by Érimón of the Milesians (humans), Bodb Derg was chosen as king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and Manannán as co-king or perhaps the king&#x27;s overseer. In one passage Manannán declares he has assumed over-kingship above the petty kings of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

Manannán was tasked with allotting which sídhe or fairy mounds the surviving members of the Tuatha Dé Danann were to be settled. Manannán&#x27;s own dwelling was at Emain Ablach, in the city of Cruithin na Cuan, as the tale later reveals. Manannán ensured the welfare of the Tuatha Dé Danann by concealing in the &quot;féth fíada&quot; or a mist of invisibility, holding the Feast of Goibniu (Fleadh Goibhneann) which conferred eternal youth, and feeding them Manannan&#x27;s Swine (Mucca Mhannanain) which gave an inexhaustible supply of food. Arbois de Jubainville stated that these seven pigs here and &#x27;s swine of the ancient text parallel each other. The routine for reviving the seven pigs was to put the bones in the sty (or manger).

====Gifts to Cormac mac Airt====
Manannán in the tale &quot;Echtra Cormaic&quot; owned two magical items which he gave away to Cormac mac Airt, high king of Tara: a soothing musical silver branch with apples made of gold, and the Goblet of Truth.

Manannán initially appeared in the guise of a warrior, and described without naming his homeland as a place where old age, sickness, death, decay, and falsehood were unknown. He eventually coaxed the king to arrive as guest to this Land of Promise (Tír Tairngire).

====Gifts and Loans to Lugh====

Manannán had other magical items according to the &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot;, a romance that only survives in early Modern Irish recensions.

He had a self-navigating boat called &quot;Manannán&#x27;s currach&quot; (coracle), () or &#x27;Wave-sweeper&#x27; was self-navigating, as well as a horse that could travel over land or sea called Aonbharr of Manannan, translated in popular re-telling as &quot;Enbarr of the Flowing Mane&quot;. Both the horse and boat were on loan to Lugh Lamhfada, but the Sons of Tuireann managed to borrow the boat.

Manannán also supplied Lugh with a full array of armor and weapon as the Tuatha Dé gathered their host to battle the Fomorians. Lugh rode Manannán&#x27;s steed Aonbharr, and was girt with Manannán&#x27;s sword Fragarach (&quot;Retaliator&quot; or &quot;The Answerer&quot;). Any wound this sword gave proved fatal, and its opponent was reduced to the weakness of a woman in childbirth.

Lug also wore Manannán&#x27;s helmet Cathbarr, which O&#x27;Curry amends to Cennbhearr, which he regards as a common noun and not a proper name. This helm was set with two precious gems on the front and one in the rear. Manannán&#x27;s or body armour and Manannán&#x27;s &quot;scabal&quot; (neck-piece or breastplate) were also part of Lugh&#x27;s panoply.

====Gifts to the Fíana ====
Manannán was also the owner of the &quot;crane-bag&quot; () full of treasures, according to the Middle-Irish Fenian lay &quot;The Crane-Bag&quot; ( Poem VIII) datable to the 13th century,

To Manannán was sent a woman transformed into the shape of a crane. She was Aoife, daughter of Dealbhaoth (), and mistress of Ilbhreac of many beauties (). Ilbhreac here may have been Ilbhreac son of Manannán. Aoife was transformed by the druidery of her jealous love-rival (Iuchra daughter of Ábartach), whose spell was to last 200 years.

When Aoife died, Manannán crafted her crane&#x27;s skin into a magical treasure bag, whose contents were only visible when flooded during full tide, and would seem empty when the tide had ebbed. The bag was in the possession of Lugh Lamhfada, then taken by Lugh&#x27;s killers, the three sons of Cermait. Later Manannán endowed it to Conaire Mór the high king at Tara. The crane-bag was eventually owned by Cumhall mac Trénmhóir, as told at the outset of this lay.&quot;Macgnímartha Finn&quot;. This is assumed to be the &quot;treasure-bag&quot; that was lost to Cumhall&#x27;s &quot;servant-turned-traitor&quot;, Liath Luachra, who treacherously wounded Cumall in the Cath Cnucha, but recovered later by Cumhall&#x27;s son, Finn when he grew up.
;()

Manannán also commissioned the craftsman Lucra (recté Luchta) to make him a shield to be made of wood, and this later passed on to Finn, according to the lay () &quot;Shield of Fionn&quot;. The wood came from a withered hazel tree, on the fork which Lugh had set the severed head of Balor. The venom had penetrated this tree, killing or blinding workers trying uprooting or handling it. Various owners are named, such as Tadg mac Nuadat, but was given by Manannán to Crimall mac Trenmor, Finn&#x27;s uncle, after the death of Finn&#x27;s father.

==== Parallels ====
Manannán is furthermore identified with several trickster figures including the Gilla Decair and the &quot;Bodach an Chóta Lachtna&quot; (&#x27;the Churl in the Drab Coat&#x27;).

The similarity of Manannan&#x27;s inexhaustible swine to Odin&#x27;s boar Sæhrímnir in Scandinavian myth has been noticed. Mannanán also owned a speckled cow that he and Aengus retrieved from India along with a dun cow, two golden goblets, and two spancels of silk.

=== Familial relations ===
Manannán&#x27;s father is the sea-god (&#x27;Sea; Ocean&#x27;; is the genitive form), whose role he seems to take over. As , his father is named as , son of . In the , calls himself the foster-son of the .

According to (&#x27;The Cattle-raid of Cooley&#x27;), his wife is the beautiful goddess Fand (&#x27;Pearl of Beauty&#x27; or &#x27;A Tear&#x27; – later remembered as a &quot;fairy queen&quot;, though earlier mentions point to her also being a sea deity). Other sources say his wife was the goddess Áine, though she is at other times said to be his daughter. Manannán had a daughter, whose name was Niamh of the Golden Hair. It is also probable that another daughter was Clíodhna, but early sources do not treat her consistently. Either way, she is a young woman from Manannán&#x27;s lands, whose epithet is &quot;of the Fair Hair&quot;. Manannán also had a yellow-haired daughter given also the name Curcog (meaning &#x27;Beehive&#x27; or &#x27;Bushy-tuft&#x27;) who was given up to be fostered by Aengus.

Manannán is also given sons named Eachdond Mór and Gaidiar, who raped Becuma Cneisgel.

Another daughter of Manannán was said to be Saint Athrachta; according to oral legend, she tried to build a causeway across Lough Gara by carrying large stones in her petticoat but was prevented by modesty. In another legend of Athractha, she was said to live at the bottom of Lough Gara and only emerged every seven years to visit her sister Cé. Athractha cured a woman, and once a dragon with the roar of a lion emerged from the sludge and was vanquished by the Holy Virgin. There is also folklore that Cé (or Céibh) the daughter of Manannan lost her beauty and wits due to an incantation, but recovered her beauty after Oisín provided her hospices after others all shunned her.

In &quot;The Voyage of Bran&quot;, Manannán prophesied to Bran that a great warrior would be descended from him. Thus Mongán mac Fiachnai becomes a late addition to the mac Lir family tree. The historical Mongán was a son of Fiachnae mac Báetáin, born towards the end of the 6th century. According to legend, Fiachnae came home with a victory from a war in what is today Scotland because of a bargain made with Manannán (either by him, or by his wife) to let Manannán have a child by his wife. This child, Mongán, was supposedly taken to the Otherworld when he was very young, to be raised there by Manannán. The 8th-century saga &quot;Compert Mongáin&quot; tells recounts the deeds of a legendary son, In the &quot;Dinsenchas&quot;, Manannán is also described as the father of Ibel, after whose death Manannán cast draughts of grief from his heart that became Loch Ruidi, Loch Cuan, and Loch Dacaech.

Manannán is often seen in the traditional role of foster father, raising a number of foster children including Lugh of the great hand and the children of Deirdre.

Two brothers of Manannán are named, after whom cleared plains were named: Bron, who it is implied was slain by Fergus and Ceite. Similarly, in Welsh folklore Brân the Blessed is the brother of Manawydan.

== Folklore ==
=== County Monaghan ===
There are many oral folktales about conflicts between Manannán and St. Patrick in County Monaghan. In many of them Manannán invites St. Patrick to his castle for a feast; however, Patrick is warned by a butler or servant not to eat the food because it is poisoned. In retaliation for the crime, Patrick turns Manannán into a giant eel or salmon, and in some stories he is placed in a bottle and sent to the bottom of a lake to guard his iron treasure chest (or barrel) until the end of time. The treasure is chained to a team of white horses, and the chain can be seen at the top of the lake. In one story from County Monaghan, Manannán&#x27;s castle was built with mortar from the blood of slaughtered animals, which allowed it to resist weathering for centuries. When the top of the castle toppled over, the bottom part sank into the ground, but the ruins could still be seen owing to the power of Manannán. In some stories, Manann was said to ride a flying white steed and could transform himself into a dove and could be heard crying every seven years.

In another story, Manann was a druid who challenged St. Patrick over whose god was more powerful. Manann covered the land in darkness, but St. Patrick placed his crozier in the ground, prayed to God, and dispelled the darkness. At the spot where St. Patrick placed his crozier, a well called &quot;Tobar Lasar&quot; sprang from the ground.

In another story, villagers searching for Manann&#x27;s treasure attempt to drain his lake, but just before they complete their task, a man on a white steed appears before them to send them on an errand. When they return a large rock is placed in the spot where they were digging, and no chisel or hammer can break it. In a variant of this story, all the men&#x27;s horses are killed, and the work they had completed to dig the channel was filled with silt.

In another story, Manann was said to live in a castle and own a fabulous cow and calf that gave milk to everyone in the parish who wanted it. Some of the older people were jealous of the cow&#x27;s abundance, and an old Protestant woman went to milk the cow into a sieve. When the cow saw what has happening, it was enraged and she and her calf ran to Dunany Point in County Louth, where they were turned to stone.

=== County Mayo ===
In County Mayo, a pot of treasure was supposed to be buried in Manann&#x27;s wood, and this treasure was guarded by a serpent.

In a variant to the story about the formation of Lough Cullin and Lough Conn, Manann was said to have a huntsman named Cullen who had two hunting dogs. The dogs chased after a ferocious boar, and when they overtook the boar, the boar turned and killed the dogs in Lough Conn. Cullen was then drowned at Lough Cullin.

=== County Donegal ===
In a folktale from Donegal, St. Colum Cille broke his golden chalice and sent a servant to the mainland to have it repaired. While returning to the mainland in his currach, the servant met a stranger in a currach (later identified as Manannán), who blew his breath on the chalice, which then became whole again. Manannán then asked for a response from Colum Cille, who relayed that there would be no forgiveness for the man responsible for such works. When Manannán heard this, he said he would provide no more help to the Irish until they are &quot;as weak as water&quot;, and then retired to the gray waves in the Highlands of Scotland. In a variant of this story, Manann was said to live in a castle near a lake, and at night, he would draw the lake around the castle like a moat, but each morning he would return the lake to its proper place. A boy gathering water from a well ran into Manann and accidentally broke his Delft pitcher. Manann offered to put the Dellft pitcher back together using witchcraft if the boy would ask Colum Cille what sort of people go to hell. Colum Cille told the boy that people such as Manann go to hell, and when he returned to report this to Manann, Manann was so enraged that he packed up his gold in a barrel and enchanted both the gold and himself. A diver from Dublin later went down into the lake and found Manann&#x27;s barrel of gold with a monstrous serpent chained to it. Men from the village then tried to drain the lake, but the morning after drilling the drain, they found it all closed up with grass growing over it.

Manann was king of the faeries and coveted a beautiful meadow in Carndonagh owned by Neill na hAirde (in some versions another faery king). Manann bought the land from Neill with pearls from the ocean and built a beautiful castle there. Neill&#x27;s wife grew jealous, and she compelled her husband to go to war over the castle. Neill&#x27;s army was defeated Manann&#x27;s, but in retribution, Neill (or in a variant, Manann) rode out to Bar Mouth; there he removed three enchanted rods that held back the ocean. The castle and land were subsequently submerged, but the gardens and castle can still be seen beneath the waves in Straghbregagh.

According to Donegal folklore, Manannán is said to be buried in the Tonn Banks off the coast of Inishowen, which form part of a Triad called the Three Waves of Erin. When Cú Chulainn struck his shield, the three waves of Erin echoed the sound and roared across the ocean. Manannán&#x27;s spirit is believed to ride the storms that occur when ships are wrecked. The three legs of Manannán &quot;paradoxically&quot; make up the heraldic arms of Man, and are said to represent the &quot;storm-god careering over land and sea with whirling motion&quot;.

=== Merchant Orbsen ===
The 9th century (&#x27;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&#x27;) euhemerizes Manannán as &quot;a famous merchant&quot; of the Isle of Man and the best sailor in western Europe, who knew by &quot;studying the heavens&quot; when the weather would be good and bad. O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s annotation remarks that this merchant went by another name, Orbsen, son of Allot, and it is stated thus in Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Ogygia&quot; (1685).

However, the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan&quot; (written c. 1400) separates these figures, stating there were four individuals called &quot;Manandán&quot; who lived at different times. They were: &quot;Manandán mac Alloit&quot;, a &quot;druid of the Tuath Dé Danann&quot; whose &quot;proper name was Oirbsen&quot;; &quot;Manandán mac Lir&quot;, a great sailor, merchant and druid; &quot;Manandán mac Cirp&quot;, king of the Isles and Mann; and &quot;Manandán mac Atgnai&quot;, who took in the sons of Uisnech and sailed to Ireland to avenge their deaths.

Tradition has it that Orbsen engaged in the Battle of Moycullen in Co. Galway, and fell on the brink of Lake Orbsen; the lake, named after him, is the present-day Lough Corrib. The conflict in which Manannan mac Alloid was slain by Ullinn was recorded in verse by 11th century poet Flann Mainistrech. There is a great stone pillar erected in the field of Moycullin, possibly marking the battle location.

Oirbsen is also mentioned in the Lebor Gabala Erenn, where it gives his genealogy as follows: Galia s. Oirbsen s. Elloth s. Elada s. Delbaeth s. Net.

It goes on to state: &quot;Orbsen was the name of Manannan at first, and from him is named Loch Orbsen in Connachta. When Manannan was being buried, it is then the lake burst over the land, [through the burial].&quot;

=== O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Horse Race ===
There is a folk tale that an English horse racer challenges one of the O&#x27;Neills to a horse race. Manannán wants to defend the character of the Irish and knows that none of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s horses stands a chance against the Englishman&#x27;s, so he appears in the form of a beggar and challenges the Englishman to a race that he himself runs from Shane&#x27;s Castle to Dublin. By his enchantments, he wins the race and defends the pride of Ireland and the O&#x27;Neill clan. The tale bears some resemblance to the horse race of Macha and also the Roman tradition in which &quot;Neptune Equester&quot; oversaw horse races.

=== O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern ===
In the story &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern&quot;, Manannan appears as a kern or serving man at the courts of various historical personages from 16th Century Ireland. As a kern, Manannan is repeatedly described as wearing thinly striped clothing and leather brogues (shoes) soaking with water, having ears and half his sword protruding from his mantle, and carrying three scorched holly javelins (elsewhere described as a single javelin) in his right hand. In this guise, he again appears as a trickster, walking into his hosts&#x27; homes uninvited and undetected by the guardsmen.

At Black Hugh O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s home in Ballyshannon, Manannan challenges the court musicians to a competition, and with a harp plays music so sweetly melodious that it can put anyone to sleep – including the suffering and dying. O&#x27;Donnell declares he has never heard such beautiful music and offers the kern new clothing; the kern refuses O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s gift and also refuses to stay in his court (indicating he must go to Cnoc Aine the next day), so O&#x27;Donnell has his men surround the kern to prevent his departure. Manannan again plays music, but this time the strain causes O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s men to hack each other to pieces with axes. When he leaves O&#x27;Donnell, Manannan extracts a fine of twenty cattle and land, and in exchange, rubs a magic herb on the gums of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s slaughtered men that revives them to life.

At the kern&#x27;s next stop near Limerick, Shane Mac an Iarla invites the kern into his home, having heard of Manannan&#x27;s reputation with reading and music, to which Manannan declares he is not impotent. However, when Shane brings the kern an instrument and a book, the kern is unable to read or play until Shane lampoons him. When Shane asks Manannan whether he has visited Desmond before, he declares that he was there with the Fianna, several millennia earlier.

Next, the kern travels to Leinster to visit MacEochaidh, who is incapacitated with a broken leg and blood poisoning. When asked about his art, the kern declares that he is a healer and tells MacEochaidh that if he will put his stingy, churlish behavior past him he would be healed. Manannan then dresses MacEochaidh&#x27;s leg with a healing herb, who immediately recovers from his affliction. MacEochaidh then throws a feast for Manannan and offers him his buxom daughter along with three hundred each of cattle, horses, sheep, and hogs. Before he can receive his reward, however, the kern flees MacEochaidh&#x27;s house to his next destination.

He goes to Sligo where he encounters O&#x27;Conner, who is about to make war with Munster. After some ridicule from O&#x27;Conner&#x27;s men, the kern offers his military services to O&#x27;Conner if he agrees that nothing unfair will be done to the kern. O&#x27;Conner&#x27;s men engage in cattle raiding, and when the men of Munster attempt to steal them back, Manannan kills them with a bow and 24 arrows. He then drives all the cattle across the Shannon and back to O&#x27;Conner in Sligo. At a feast to celebrate the victory, O&#x27;Conner slights Manannan by drinking the first toast without a thought to the kern, so Manannan recites some verses indicating his displeasure and then vanishes from the company.

Then, the kern goes to Teigue O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s home and describes his art as conjuring. He bluffs O&#x27;Kelly with two spurious tricks (wagging an ear and making a reed disappear), then from a bag conjures a thread that he throws into the air and fixes to a cloud, a hare, a beagle, and a dog boy. From another bag he pulls a woman, and all the characters go running up the thread into the clouds. The king remarks that something bad will happen, such as the boy ending up with the woman, and the dog eating the hare. When Manannan reels in his thread, this is indeed, exactly what the men discover has happened, and O&#x27;Kelly, in anger, beheads the dogboy. The kern then replaces the dog boy&#x27;s head backward, but after O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s complaints turns it back to the right side.

Finally, the kern visits the King of Leinster, whose musicians he declares sound worse than the sledgehammer&#x27;s thunder in the lowest regions of hell. The King&#x27;s musicians and men then jump the kern, but each blow they make on the kern inflicts the same wound on themselves. In retaliation, the King has the kern taken out 3 times to the gallows to be hanged, but each time, they find in the kern&#x27;s place one of the king&#x27;s confidants at the end of the rope. The following day at sunrise, the kern returns to the king&#x27;s castle and offers to heal all the men who were killed the previous day, which he revives with a healing herb.

It is only at the end of the tale that the kern is revealed as Manannan, who is offered a dish of crabapples and bonnyclabber at Shane O&#x27;Donnellan&#x27;s house in Meath. As the kern, Manannan repeatedly calls himself sweet one day and bitter or sour the next and describes himself as a stroller or traveler who was born in &quot;Ellach of the kings&quot;. He also gives the following names for himself &quot;Duartaine O&#x27;Duartaine&quot;, &quot;Cathal O&#x27;Cein&quot;, &quot;Gilla de&quot;, and &quot;Gilla Decair&quot; during his travels. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern is an example of the folk memory of the Irish gods long after Christianization.

=== The Pursuit of the Gilla Decair and His Horse ===
As the Gilla Decair, a name also referenced in &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern&quot;, Manannán appears in the Fenian story &quot;The Pursuit of the Gilla Decair and his Horse&quot;. In this tale the Fianna encounter the Gilla on Samhain while pursuing the hunt through the forests of Ballachgowan in Munster. The Gilla is described as a gigantic, virile ruffian with black limbs, devilish, misshapen, and ugly, leading a gaunt horse with grey hindquarters and thin legs with an iron chain. Additionally, the Gilla is dressed as a warrior with a convex, black shield hanging from his back, a wide grooved sword at his left thigh, two long javelins at his shoulder, and a limp mantle about him, all reminiscent of Manannan&#x27;s description in &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern&quot;. After greeting Finn with a lay that begins, &quot;May the gods bless thee, Finn, O man of affable discourse ...&quot;, the Gilla tells Finn that he is a Fomorian who visits the kings of Christendom to earn a wage, and that his name was given because of the great personal sacrifices he makes on behalf of his retainers. The Gilla then asks Finn if he will hire him as a horseman, to which Finn assents, and then asks to release his horse to graze with those of the Fianna. When Finn grants his permission, the Gilla unbridles his horse to graze with the others and proceeds to mutilate and kill all the horses of the Fianna.

After seeking the Fianna&#x27;s counsel, Finn tells Conán mac Morna to mount the Gilla&#x27;s horse and ride him to death, but though he tries violently to make the horse move, he won&#x27;t budge. Thirteen other Fianna then mount the horse in an attempt to weigh the horse down as much as the Gilla, but still the horse refuses to budge. The Gilla then tells Finn and the Fianna that were he to serve the rest of his term under Finn&#x27;s contemptuous frivolity, he would be pitied and mocked, so he tells them that he will be parting, and leaves the Fianna with such a fierce, thundering rapidity that it is compared to the speed of a swallow and noise of a March wind over a mountain. As soon as the Gilla&#x27;s horse loses sight of his master, he speeds off after him with fourteen of the Fianna on his back. Finn and the remaining Fianna then track the Gilla and his horse until they arrive at the sea, where another of the Fianna grabs the horse&#x27;s tail as it alights over the water with the fifteen men.

Finn then travels to Ben-Adar, where the Tuatha Dé Danann promised the children of the Gael that should they ever need to leave Ireland, they would encounter a ship outfit for them. As the Fianna approach the sea, Finn encounters a pair of men, described as &quot;bulkiest of heroes, most powerful of fighting men, hardiest of champions&quot;. Both men bear shields with lions, leopards, and griffins, &quot;terrible&quot; swords, crimson cloaks with gold fibulae, gold sandals, and gold bands on their heads. They bow to Finn and tell him they are the sons of the King of India, who have the ability to create ships with three fells of the axe and can carry the ships over land and sea. One of the brothers tells Finn that his name is Feradach.

After three days on Feradach&#x27;s ships without seeing any land or coastline, the Fianna reach a craggy island where they spot the Gilla&#x27;s tracks. Here it is determined that Dermot, who was fostered by Manannan and Aengus Og, is shamed into vaulting onto the island using the javelins of Manannan, which he possessed. Dermot leaves the Fianna behind and ventures a beautiful forested land, filled with buzzing bees and birds. In the midst of the forested plain, Dermot beholds a massive tree with interlacing branches, beneath which is a well of pure water with an ornamented drinking horn suspended above it. Dermot lusts after the water in the well, pursues it and is confronted with a loud rumbling noise indicating that none should drink of its waters. Dermot drinks the water, and a hostile wizard appears who upbraids Dermot for roaming his forests and drinking his water. Dermot and the wizard battle each other, and the wizard jumps into the well, leaving Dermot behind. Dermot then kills a stag with his javelin, cooks it, and falls asleep. The next day, he finds the wizard, and the two continue their fight for three days with the wizard jumping into his well at the end of each day. On the third day, Dermot follows the wizard into the well and finds upon his emergence, a wide open flowery plain with a regal city. He follows the wizard into the city where he fights the host until he is bleeding, injured, and on the ground. When Dermot awakens, a burly wizard kicks him in the back and explains that he is not there to do Dermot harm but to explain that he is in a dangerous place of enemies. The wizard then takes Dermot on a long journey to a towering fortress, where his wounds are healed with herbs, and he is taken to feasting with the wizard&#x27;s men.

When Dermot asks where he is and whom he is, the wizard tells him he is in &quot;Tir fo Thuinn&quot;, that he is the Wizard of Chivalry who is an enemy of the Wizard of the Well, with whom Dermot had fought, and that he was hired o work under Finn for a year. While Dermot is detained with the Wizard of Chivalry, Finn and the Fianna craft rope ladders and also scale the cliffs onto the island. There they encounter a king on horseback who takes them to his kingdom where they enjoy feasting. The Fianna wage war with the king against the King of Greece, who is attempting to invade the island. After winning the war, there is a great celebration with the kings of other lands, and there Finn is reunited with Dermot. Dermot explains that the Gilla&#x27;s true name is Abartach son of Allchad, and he lives in the Land of Promise.

The daughter of the King of Greece promised herself to Finn prior to the King&#x27;s defeat, so the Fianna split into groups again, one to pursue Abartach, and the other to Greece. The Fianna retrieve the King of Greece&#x27;s daughter Taise for Finn, and return to the Land of Promise. There they reunite with Finn, who has found Abartach. Abartach challenges Finn to determine what debt is owed for the long journeys, adventures, and victories of the Fianna, to which Conan demands payment in the form of fourteen women from the Land of Promise along with Abartach&#x27;s own wife, who are to ride on his horse, as the Fianna had, back to Ireland. Abartach agrees to the terms, vanishes before the Fianna, and the company returns to Ireland.

Although none of the characters in the story are explicitly called Manannan, the setting of the tale in &quot;Tir fo Thuinn&quot;, the use of the name Gilla Decair, which is explicitly one of Manannan&#x27;s bynames in O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Kern, and the description of the Gilla&#x27;s behavior all clearly point to his being the central character on the island. Additionally, the name Abartach is used in the context of Manannan&#x27;s family as the right-hand man of Manannan&#x27;s son Eachdond Mor. In the &quot;Book of Lecan&quot; Abartach and Manannan are listed together as two celebrated chiefs of the Tuatha De known for being, respectively, a great musician and a great navigator. Elsewhere Abartach, whose name means dwarf, and who also goes by the name Averty, was a magician of dwarfish size that terrorized part of Ireland. Abartach was only vulnerable in one part of his body, and Fionn mac Cumhaill was able to slay him by sticking his thumb into his mouth to determine the vulnerable spot before spearing him. Abartach was then buried upside down in his grave to prevent his rising from the dead.

== In Manx mythology ==
=== Manx folklore ===

According to the local lore of the Isle of Man, Manannán was the island&#x27;s first ruler.

;First ruler
A document called the &quot;Supposed True Chronicle of Man&quot; (16th century) asserts that Manannan was the first &quot;ruler of Mann&quot; and &quot;was as paynim (pagan), and kept, by necromancy, the Land of Man under mists&quot;, and imposed as tax a bundle of green rushes, which was due every Midsummer Eve at a place called Warfield (the present-day South Barrule). More or less the same thing is stated in verse within &quot;The Traditionary Ballad&quot; aka &quot;Manannan beg va Mac y Leirr&quot; (1504), whose third quatrain ran:
The poem thus identified the king of the island as one , &#x27;little Manannan, son of the Sea&#x27; (or, &#x27;son of Leir&#x27;). Manannan was later banished by Saint Patrick according to the poem.

As to the Manx offering rushes to Manannán, there is evidence these wild plants—which typically grow in wetlands—were sacred to him.

;Illusory magic
According to tradition, Manannan once held Peel Castle, and caused a single man guarding its battlements to appear as a force of a thousand, thus succeeding in driving out his enemies. Manx storyteller Sophia Morrison repeats this story except reducing the amplification to hundredfold men, and referring to the rampart &quot;a great stone fort on Peel Island&quot;. She also appends a story that Manannan once crafted makeshift boats out of sedges, creating an illusion of a larger fleet, causing the Viking invaders to flee in terror from the bay of Peel Island.

==Toponymy==
There are places named after Manannán in Ireland, the Isle of Man and Scotland. In Ireland, most of them are on the coast or contain water features. They include Mannin Lake () in County Mayo, Mannin Bay () in County Galway, Mannin Island () in County Cork, Cashelmanannan (, &#x27;Manannán&#x27;s Ringfort&#x27;) and Sheevannan (, &#x27;Manannán&#x27;s Fairy-mound&#x27;) in County Roscommon, Derrymannin (, &#x27;Manann&#x27;s Oak&#x27;) in County Mayo, and Carrickmannon (, &#x27;Manannán&#x27;s Rock&#x27;) in County Down. Also in Ireland, Lough Corrib takes its name from Manannán&#x27;s alternate name or . The placenames Clackmannan () and Slamannan () in Scotland may also refer to .

<text>Manawydan fab Llŷr is a figure of Welsh mythology, the son of Llŷr and the brother of Brân the Blessed and Brânwen. The first element in his name is cognate with the stem of the name of the Irish sea god Manannán mac Lir, and likely originated from the same Celtic deity as Manannán. Unlike Manannán, however, no surviving material connects him with the sea in any way except for his patronymic (&quot;llŷr&quot; is an old Welsh word for &quot;sea&quot;). Manawydan&#x27;s most important appearances occur in the Second and Third Branches of the Mabinogi (the latter of which is named for him), but he is also referenced frequently in medieval poetry and the Welsh Triads.

==The Mabinogi==
===Second Branch===
Manawydan is an important character in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, the &quot;Mabinogi of Brânwen, Daughter of Llŷr&quot;. In this tale, Manawydan serves as advisor to his brother Brân the Blessed, the King of Britain. He sits beside Brân at the feast celebrating the wedding of their sister Brânwen to Matholwch, king of Ireland, an occasion which is meant to solidify an alliance. When their half-brother Efnisien, upset that he has not been consulted, mutilates Matholwch&#x27;s horses, Brân sends Manawydan to offer recompense. Later, when word gets back to Britain that Matholwch has been mistreating Brânwen, Manawydan joins Brân&#x27;s rescue effort.

In the ensuing war, Manawydan is one of only seven men to survive. The mortally wounded Brân asks Manawydan and the others to cut off his head and take it back to Britain; it will continue speaking and keeping them company in the meantime. They come to a wondrous castle on the island of Gwales, where they enjoy a great feast and forget their sorrows. Manawydan recognizes opening the door of the castle &quot;facing Cornwall&quot; will break the spell, but one day his companion Heilyn son of Gwyn grows overcurious and opens it, and all their sorrows return. The group takes Brân&#x27;s head to the White Hill (the location of the Tower of London) and buries it there, where it serves as a talisman against foreign invasion.

===Third Branch===
Manawydan plays an even greater role in the Third Branch of the Mabinogi. In this tale, one of Manawydan&#x27;s fellow survivors, Pryderi, invites him to live with him in Dyfed and marry Rhiannon, Pryderi&#x27;s mother after they both returned from the fighting in Ireland (in the Second Branch). Soon, a spell caused all the people and domestic animals in Dyfed to disappear, leaving only Rhiannon, Pryderi and his wife Cigfa, and Manawydan. They lived by hunting for a while then went to England to make a living as craftsmen, but the excellence of their work led to the other craftsmen plotting to kill them out of jealousy, so that eventually they returned to Dyfed. 

One day, Manawydan and Pryderi, while out hunting, saw a white boar which they followed. It went into a mysterious fort. Pryderi followed and didn&#x27;t return. On hearing the story, Rhiannon too went into the fort and found Pryderi stuck rigid and speechless to a golden bowl in the middle of the floor. She too touched the bowl and became stuck, a mist descended and the fort then disappeared. 

Manawydan and Cigfa again were forced to try to make a living in England and again were driven away by jealous rivals. This time, Manawydan brought back wheat and sowed three crofts, but as they became ready for reaping, he found the first two stripped bare overnight. He guarded the third croft and saw a multitude of mice stealing the corn. He caught one which seemed slow and fat. The next day, he started trying to hang it for stealing. Three strangers approached and offered to ransom the mouse, and by refusing to agree Manawydan was able to persuade the third stranger, a bishop, to remove the curse on Dyfed and release Pryderi and Rhiannon.

All three strangers turned out to be Llwyd ap Cil Coed in disguise, who placed the spell upon the golden bowl. Llwyd told Manawydan that he was a friend of Gwawl (from the First Branch) and had enchanted Dyfed and captured Rhiannon and Pryderi in revenge for the insult done to Gwawl by Pwyll (Pryderi&#x27;s father and Rhiannon&#x27;s first husband). The mouse turned out to be the wife of Llwyd, who had gone with the other women of Llwyd&#x27;s court disguised as mice to steal the grain (the previous two nights, it had been Llwyd&#x27;s warband). She was pregnant, which made her slower than the rest. While in captivity, Rhiannon had to carry the yokes of the horses, while Pryderi had to carry the gate hammers.

==Other appearances==
Manawydan is mentioned in the poem known as &quot;Pa gur yv y porthaur&quot; (&quot;What Man is the Gatekeeper?&quot;), where he is named as one of the warriors in King Arthur&#x27;s retinue. The poem praises him as providing worthy counsel and for splintering shields at a place called &quot;Tryfrwyd&quot;; later in the poem this battle is associated with &quot;cinbin&quot; or dogheads and a figure known as Garwlwyd (Rough-Gray). Tryfrwyd shows up as the Battle of Tribuit in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and in later works. 

In &quot;How Culhwch Won Olwen&quot;, Manawydan appears once again as a knight of Arthur&#x27;s and takes part in the hunting of the Twrch Trwyth. He is mentioned twice in &quot;Trioedd Ynys Prydein&quot;; he is named as one of the &quot;Three Golden Shoemakers of the Island of Britain&quot;, a reference to his role as a shoemaker in &quot;Manawydan uab Llyr&quot;, and as one of the &quot;Three Prostrate Chieftains of the Island of Britain&quot;, a reference to his submission to the usurper Caswallon. Reference is made to the &quot;land of Manawyd&quot; in the epic poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;.

===Modern===
In 2001, the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; video game &quot;The Duelists of the Roses&quot; included an antagonistic figure named Manawyddan fab Llyr, an incarnation to the villain Darknite. Two years later in the 2003 film &quot;Otherworld&quot;, Manawydan was portrayed by Welsh actor Daniel Evans. Manawydan appeared as a vengeful sea god in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Warlord Chronicles&quot;.

<doc id="85883" wikidata="Q1827715" url="?curid=85883" title="Lir">
<text>Lir or Ler (meaning &quot;Sea&quot; in Old Irish; &quot;Ler&quot; and &quot;Lir&quot; are the nominative and genitive forms, respectively) is a sea god in Irish mythology. His name suggests that he is a personification of the sea, rather than a distinct deity. He is named &quot;Allód&quot; in early genealogies, and corresponds to the Llŷr of Welsh mythology. Lir is chiefly an ancestor figure, and is the father of the god Manannán mac Lir, who appears frequently in medieval Irish literature. Lir appears as the eponymous king in the tale &quot;The Children of Lir&quot;.

==Gaelic references==
Lir, like his Welsh counterpart Llŷr, is a god of the sea, though in the case of the Gaelic myths his son Manannán mac Lir seems to take over his position and so features more prominently. It is probable that more myths referring to Lir which are now lost to us existed and that his popularity was greater, especially considering the number of figures called &#x27;son of Lir&#x27;.

In the 9th century AD Irish glossary entitled Sanas Cormaic, famed bishop and scholar Cormac mac Cuilennáin makes mention of Manannan and his father Lir, who Cormac identifies with the sea:

:&quot;Manannan mac lir .i. cennaige amra bói aninis Manand. ise luam as deach boi aniarthar Eorpa. noḟindad tre nemgnacht (.i. gnathugrud nime) inoiret nobíd insoinind ⁊ in do[i]nind ⁊ intan nosclæchlóbad cechtar don dá résin, inde Scoti et Brittones eum deum vocaverunt maris. et inde filium maris esse dixerunt .i. mac lir mac mara.&quot;

:&quot;Manannan mac Lir: i. e. a renowned trader who dwelt in the Isle of Man. He was the best pilot in the west of Europe. Through acquaintance with the sky he knew the quarter in which would be fair weather and foul weather, and when each of these two seasons would change. Hence the Scots and Britons called him a god of the sea, and hence they said he was son of the sea, i. e. &quot;mac lir&quot; &#x27;son of the sea&quot;

Lir is a key character in the mythological story &quot;The Children of Lir&quot;; however, it is not definitely established whether this is the same person as Manannán&#x27;s father or a different Lir. The Lir in this story was the rival of Bodb Dearg for the kingship of the Tuatha Dé Danann after their retreat into the fairy mounds. In order to appease Lir, Bodb gave one of his daughters to marry him, Aeb. The couple had four children, one girl, Fionnuala, and three sons, Aed and twins, Fiachra and Conn.

Aebh died and, not wanting the children to remain motherless, Bodb sent another of his daughters, Aoife, to marry Lir. Aoife grew jealous of the children and cursed them to live as swans for 900 years.

As Allod the &quot;all-famous,&quot; Lir is listed as the father of Crofhind the Chaste in the Metrical Dindshenchas.

In the poem &quot;Baile Suthain Sith Eamhain&quot; Midir is named as the father of Lir and grandfather of Manannan. A son of Lir is named as Lodan in &quot;The Adventures of Art son of Conn&quot;.

<text>In Irish mythology, Queen Achtland married one of the Tuatha Dé Danann who were the people of the goddess Danu.

Achtland herself was a mortal woman, and as an adult she was infamous for her displeasure in what she found available to her among human men. It is said that no man could ever satisfy her, but when she was approached by one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, her heart was smitten with him.

She married this man of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and became immortal by crossing over into the land of the &quot;síde&quot; to be his wife. It is said that she found great delight in brushing his long silken hair.

==Etymology==
This name appears to be derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Hek-to-landā&quot;. 
The name literally means &quot;cattle-adorned pasture.&quot; (cf. ). 
The Romano-British form of this Proto-Celtic theonym is likely to have been *&quot;Hectolanda&quot; (cf. ).</text><links>

<doc id="85887" wikidata="Q54153" url="?curid=85887" title="Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship">
<text>Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship ( ) is one of Poland&#x27;s 16 voivodeships (provinces). 

It was created on 1 January 1999 and is situated in mid-northern Poland, on the boundary between the two historic regions, from which it takes its name: Kuyavia () and Pomerania (). 

Its two chief cities, serving as the province&#x27;s joint capitals, are Bydgoszcz and Toruń.

== History==

The Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999, as a result of the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It consisted of territory from the former Bydgoszcz, Toruń and Włocławek Voivodeships.

The area now known as Kuyavia-Pomerania was previously divided between the region of Kuyavia, Dobrzyń Land, Pomerania (including Chełmno Land and Kociewie), and Greater Poland (including Pałuki and Krajna). Of the two principal cities of today&#x27;s Kuyavian–Pomeranian voivodeship, one (Bydgoszcz) was historically located in Kuyavia, while the other (Toruń) was an important town of Chełmno Land.
==Administration and territory==
The functions of regional capital are split between Bydgoszcz and Toruń. Bydgoszcz serves as the seat of the centrally appointed governor or voivode (), while Toruń is the seat of the elected Regional Assembly (sejmik), and of the executive elected by that assembly, headed by the voivodeship marshal (&quot;marszałek województwa&quot;).

The Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship is bordered by five other voivodeships. These are Pomeranian Voivodeship to the north, Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship to the north-east, Masovian Voivodeship to the east, Łódź Voivodeship across a short boundary to the south, and Greater Poland Voivodeship to the south and west.

==Cities and towns==


The voivodeship contains 5 cities and 47 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):
== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 21.8 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.4% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,300 euros or 57% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 64% of the EU average.

==Transportation==
Transportation infrastructure is of critical importance to the voivodeship&#x27;s economy. Kuyavia-Pomerania is a major node in the Polish transportation system. Railway lines from the South and East pass through Bydgoszcz to connect to the major ports on the Baltic Sea. In addition to this, Bydgoszcz is home to the rolling stock manufacturer PESA SA, Poland&#x27;s largest and most modern producer of railway and tram products. The province&#x27;s sole international airport, Ignacy Jan Paderewski Airport, is located in Bydgoszcz and has connections to a number of European destinations as well as Warsaw, which are all operated by either Irish carrier Ryanair or LOT Polish Airlines.

The main railway stations of the province are Bydgoszcz main station and Toruń main station; both stations are served by fast PKP Intercity trains which connect them with the capital Warsaw, as well as other major Polish cities. In addition to these fast express services, inter-regional trains are operated by the firm Przewozy Regionalne, while domestic rail transportation within the voivodeship is provided by Arriva RP, a private firm to which the provincial government subcontracted the provision of rail transport.

The A1 and S5 highways pass through the province, with the S10 also under construction.

All major towns of the province have municipal transportation companies operating buses, while Bydgoszcz, Toruń and Grudziądz also have extensive tram systems.

==Politics==

The Kuyavian-Pomeranian voivodeship&#x27;s government is headed by the province&#x27;s voivode &quot;(governor)&quot; who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship&#x27;s marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship&#x27;s executive and is elected by the sejmik &quot;(provincial assembly)&quot;. The current voivode of Kuyavia-Pomerania is Ewa Monika Mes, and the present marshal is Piotr Całbecki.

The Sejmik of Kuyavia-Pomerania consists of 33 members.

===Governors===

== Administrative division ==
The Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship is divided into 23 counties (powiats): 4 city counties and 19 land counties. These are further divided into 144 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

==Protected areas==

The Dybów Castle was the place where in 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon issued the famous Statutes of Nieszawa, covering a set of privileges for the Polish nobility; an event that is regarded as the birth of the noble democracy in Poland, which lasted until the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland. The manor in Szafarnia was a place of stay for Fryderyk Chopin during his 1824 and 1825 summer vacations, and contains a museum dedicated to the composer.

Włocławek, Toruń and Bydgoszcz contain preserved Gothic cathedrals. Locations of historic 
monasteries include Chełmno, Grudziądz, Mogilno, Rywałd and Skępe. In Gąsawa, there is the 17th-century Saint Nicolas Church with a unique collection of multi-layered mural paintings, dating back several centuries.
There are three spa towns: Ciechocinek, Inowrocław and Wieniec-Zdrój.

Major museums and art galleries are located in Bydgoszcz, Toruń and Włocławek, including the Leon Wyczółkowski Regional Museum in Bydgoszcz, District Museum in Toruń and Museum of Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land in Włocławek. The more unique museums include:

*Exploseum in Bydgoszcz, operated at the site of a former Nazi German arms factory.
There are numerous World War II memorials in the province, including a memorial at the site of the former Potulice concentration camp, memorials at the sites of Nazi massacres of Poles, including the largest massacres at Mniszek, Gniewkowo, Klamry, Łopatki and Fordon, and memorials to Allied prisoners of war held by Nazi Germany in the region at the sites of the former Stalag XX-A, Oflag XXI-B and Oflag 64 POW camps in Toruń and Szubin.

Other notable sights include the Bydgoszcz Canal, connecting Bydgoszcz and Nakło nad Notecią, the Battle of Koronowo (1410) Monument, and monuments do distinguished people from the region, including cryptologist Marian Rejewski (birthplace and monument in Bydgoszcz), writer Jan Kasprowicz (childhood home and monument in Inowrocław), and surgeon Ludwik Rydygier, the first surgeon in the world to carry out a peptic ulcer resection (former clinic and monument in Chełmno).

==Sports==

Motorcycle speedway, basketball and volleyball enjoy the largest following in the province. The KS Toruń and Polonia Bydgoszcz clubs are among the most accomplished speedway clubs in the country and contest the Pomeranian-Kuyavian Derby, one of the fiercest speedway rivalries.
Since the establishment of the province, several major international sports competitions were co-hosted by the province, including the EuroBasket 2009, 2009 Women&#x27;s European Volleyball Championship, 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, EuroBasket Women 2011, 2013 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship, and 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

<text>In Celtic mythology, Adsullata was a river goddess of the Continental Celts associated with the River Savus (Sava) in Noricum.

Later she came to Brittany from Celtic Gaul and was believed to be a goddess of hot springs and the origin of the Anglo-Celtic sun goddess, Sul.

==Etymology==
This theonym appears to be derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Ad-sūg-lat-ā&quot;. That derivation literally means (&quot;allative&quot;) &quot;sucking liquid&quot;, which may have been a byword for the notion of &quot;suck-giving liquid&quot; The Romano-British form of this Proto-Celtic reconstruction would likely have been *&quot;Adsuglata&quot;.

<doc id="85890" wikidata="Q544389" url="?curid=85890" title="Aengus">
<text>In Irish mythology, Aengus or Óengus is one of the Tuatha Dé Danann and probably originally a god associated with youth, love, summer and poetic inspiration. The son of The Dagda and Boann, Aengus is also known as Macan Óc (&quot;the young boy&quot; or &quot;young son&quot;), and corresponds to the Welsh mythical figure Mabon and the Celtic god Maponos. He plays a central role in five Irish myths.

==Name==
In Old Irish his name is &quot;Óengus&quot; or &quot;Oíngus&quot; , a name attested in Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Columba&quot; as &quot;Oinogus(s)ius&quot;. This is believed to come from a Proto-Celtic name meaning &quot;true vigour&quot;. The medieval &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; derives it from &quot;one desire&quot;, explaining that Boann gave him the name because her union with the Dagda had been her only desire. In Middle Irish this became &quot;Áengus&quot;, and in Modern Irish &quot;Aonghus&quot; , .

He is also known as &quot;Óengus Óc&quot;/&quot;Aengus Óg&quot; (&quot;Aengus the young&quot;), &quot;Mac ind Óc&quot; (&quot;son of the young&quot;), &quot;Maccan&quot;/&quot;Macán&quot;, or &quot;Mac Óc/Mac Óg&quot; (&quot;young son&quot;).

According to Celticists John T. Koch and Kenneth H. Jackson, &quot;Aengus&quot; is also cognate to the Pictish &quot;Onuist&quot;/&quot;Unuist&quot; and Old Welsh &quot;Unust&quot;.

==Family==
Aengus&#x27; parents were The Dagda and Boann, and his foster-father was variously Elcmar or Midir. He was said to have lived at Newgrange by the River Boyne, where he raised Manannán&#x27;s blonde-haired daughter Curcog as his foster. In the folklore of Scotland, Aengus is the husband of Brigid and son of Beira, the Fairy Queen of Winter. His siblings include Aed, Cermait, Bodb Derg, and Brigid. Aengus is the foster-father and protector of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Fianna. He rescues Diarmuid and Gráinne during their pursuit by the Fianna; after Diarmuid&#x27;s death, Aengus takes his body back to the Brú na Bóinne where he breathes life into it when he wishes to speak with Diarmuid. According to &quot;Death Tales of the Tuatha de Danann&quot;, Aengus kills his stepfather Elcmar in retaliation for killing Midir. Aengus has a son named Nemhannach who is mentioned in the Battle of Ventry.

==Physical description==
In a late folktale recorded in Scotland, the following physical description is provided:
&quot;Then Angus mounted his white steed and rode eastward...He was clad in raiment of shining gold, and from his shoulders hung his royal robe of crimson which the wind uplifted and spread out in gleaming splendour athwart the sky.&quot;

Then a bard composed the following song about Angus:
&lt;poem&gt;
Angus hath come - the young the fair,
The blue-eyed god with golden hair,
The god who to the world doth bring,
This morn the promise of the spring.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In Irish myths, Aengus is variously described in the following terms:
* expert in arms
* horseman
* sailor
* son of the Dagda
* of the many exploits
* of the battle squadrons (along with Aed and Cermait)
* red armed
* mighty and stern

==Mythology==
===Irish mythology===

The Dagda has an affair with Boann, the goddess of the River Boyne. She lives at Brú na Bóinne with her husband Elcmar. The Dagda impregnates her after sending Elcmar away on a one-day errand. To hide the pregnancy from Elcmar, the Dagda casts a spell on him, making &quot;the sun stand still&quot; so he will not notice the passing of time. Meanwhile, Boann gives birth to Aengus. Eventually, Aengus learns that the Dagda is his true father and asks him for a portion of land. In some versions of the tale—probably the original, from &quot;The Wooing of Etain&quot;—the Dagda helps Aengus take ownership of the Brú from Elcmar. Aengus asks and is given the Brú for &quot;láa ocus aidche&quot;; because in Old Irish this could mean either &quot;a day and a night&quot; or &quot;day and night&quot;, Aengus claims it forever. Other versions have Aengus taking over the Brú from the Dagda himself by using the same trick. The Brú is then named &quot;Brug maic ind Óig&quot; after him. In &quot;The Wooing of Etain&quot; version, Midir is Aengus&#x27;s foster-father. 

It has been suggested that this tale represents the winter solstice illumination of Newgrange at Brú na Bóinne, during which the sunbeam (the Dagda) enters the inner chamber (the womb of Boann) when the sun&#x27;s path stands still. The word &quot;solstice&quot; (Irish &quot;grianstad&quot;) means sun-standstill. The conception of Aengus may represent the &#x27;rebirth&#x27; of the sun at the winter solstice, him taking over the Brú from an older god representing the growing sun taking over from the waning sun. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin suggested the tale probably dramatizes the idea &quot;that the blooming of youth denies the process of aging - at the youthful stage of life time passes slowly and vitality seems to be permanent&quot;. 

In &quot;The Fosterage of the House of the Two Pails&quot;, a similar story is related in which Manannán mac Lir, called the High King over all the Tuath Dé, convinces Aengus to cast a spell by reciting a poem called &quot;Luck and Prosperity&quot; to his foster-father Elcmar. The spell forces Elcmar from the Brú until &quot;ogham and pillar, heaven and earth, and the sun and the moon have been blended together&quot;. Elcmar then tells Aengus that he would have given him the Brú if he had but asked, but due to Manannán&#x27;s incantation, he and his people will face woe and madness for the rest of their days. In this telling of the story, Aengus expresses remorse for banishing Elcmar and his people.

Aengus kills Lugh Lámhfhada&#x27;s poet for lying about his brother Ogma an Cermait. The poet claims that Ogma an Cermait had an affair with one of Lugh&#x27;s wives.

In &quot;The Wooing of Etain&quot;, Aengus is able to partially lift a spell against Étaín, the horse goddess he won for his brother Midir. In a jealous rage, Midir&#x27;s wife Fuamnach turns Étaín into a beautiful fly. Returning Étaín into her human form at night, Aengus makes her his lover until Fuamnach discovers the secret and drives Étaín away. Aengus kills his foster mother for her treachery.

In another tale Aengus falls in love with a girl he sees in his dreams. His mother, Boann, goddess of the River Boyne, and a cow goddess whose milk formed the Milky Way (Bealach na Bó Finne, or the White Cow&#x27;s Way in Irish), searches Ireland for a year, then his father, the Dagda, does the same. Finally, King Bodb Derg of Munster finds her after a further year.

Aengus visits the lake of the Dragon&#x27;s Mouth and finds 150 girls chained in pairs, including Caer Ibormeith, the girl from his dreams, among them. Every second Samhain, Caer and the other girls transform into swans for a year. Aengus is told he can marry Caer if he can identify her in swan form. Aengus turns himself into a swan and they fly away, singing beautiful music that puts all who listen to sleep for three days and nights.

In other legends Aengus is able to repair broken bodies and return them to life.

Similarities have been observed between Aengus and the Greek god Hermes.

===Scottish folklore===
In the folklore of Scotland, Angus is the fairest son of the Beira (the Cailleach), who rules over Winter. Aengus remains in Tír na nÓg all winter until he has a dream of Brigid that compels him to search the land for her. Brigid was held in captivity by the Fairy Queen who envied her beauty and forced Brigid to complete impossible chores. Angus finally leaves Tír na nÓg on his white steed by borrowing three days from August in order to search for Brigid. After searching everywhere, he eventually finds Brigid in Beira&#x27;s underground palace just as Spring is beginning; when they meet on the first day of spring, flowers begin to blossom and grass grows, and Brigid&#x27;s shabby clothing is transformed into white robes with silver spangles, and her hair is garlanded with spring and summer flowers. Angus marries Brigid in a wedding feast, which is disrupted by Beira, who chases them off with storm clouds on her black steed. Eventually Beira grows old and weak and has to return to the Well of Youth for rejuvenation, where she again falls asleep, and Angus and Bride become the King and Queen of summer.

In another folktale, it is related that Beira&#x27;s son Angus contradicts all of his mother&#x27;s orders in an effort to become King of the Universe. Angus is &quot;weak minded and light headed,&quot; and in punishment Beira traps her son in the rocks, where he is forced to repeat the words of others (i.e. echo).

===Possessions===
Aengus owns a sword named Moralltach, the Great Fury, given to him by Manannan mac Lir. This he gave to his foster-son Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, along with a sword named Beagalltach, the Little Fury, and two spears of great power, Gáe Buide and Gáe Derg.

In Scottish folklore Aengus possesses a golden harp with silver strings, and when he plays it maidens and youths follow the music through the woods. He also kisses lovers, and when the lovers part, the kisses become invisible birds that follow the lovers home singing love songs and whispering memories in their ears. Similarly, in the Dindsenchas, Aengus shapes his kisses into four birds that followed Cairbre to mock him each day before sunrise. This mockery continues until Cairbre&#x27;s druid enchants a tree from Fid Frosmuine with song, which causes the tree to grow high above all others and detain Aengus&#x27; birds.

In some legends, Aengus possesses a white horse, which he rides from the Land of Promise during the Spring. In the Dindsenchas, a tale called &quot;Tuag Inber&quot; is relayed in which Aengus provides Eochu and Ablend a swift horse while they are encamped with their cattle. He tells them to unbridle the horse in a meadow before it &quot;sheds its water&quot; and causes their deaths; Eochu and Ablend forget to unharness the horse, and it forms a well, around which Eochu builds confinement. The poem of Loch Ri is nearly identical to &quot;Tuag Inber,&quot; except the character names differ and Aengus is replaced by Midir.

<doc id="85896" wikidata="Q303626" url="?curid=85896" title="Silphidae">
<text>Silphidae is a family of beetles that are known commonly as large carrion beetles, carrion beetles or burying beetles. There are two subfamilies: Silphinae and Nicrophorinae. Members of Nicrophorinae are sometimes known as burying beetles or sexton beetles. The number of species is relatively small, at around two hundred. They are more diverse in the temperate region although a few tropical endemics are known. Both subfamilies feed on decaying organic matter such as dead animals. The subfamilies differ in which uses parental care and which types of carcasses they prefer. Silphidae are considered to be of importance to forensic entomologists because when they are found on a decaying body they are used to help estimate a post-mortem interval.

==Taxonomy, evolution, and etymology==
The family Silphidae belongs to the order Coleoptera. They are commonly referred to as carrion beetles or burying beetles and are usually associated with carrion, fungi, and dung. In the past, members of the family Agyrtidae were included. This family has two subfamilies, Silphinae and Nicrophorinae. The antenna is made up of 15 segments and is capitate (ending in an abruptly capped club) in the Nicrophorinae and has a more gradual club shape in the Silphinae. The subfamilies also differ in behavior. Members of the subfamily Silphinae show little to no care for their young and breed on large carrion. Nicrophorinae breed on small animal carrion and will bury themselves and their food to rear their offspring in a bi-parental manner. There are approximately 183 species in this family, which are found worldwide although they are commoner in temperate regions. &quot;Nicrophorus americanus&quot;, known as the American burying beetle, is an endangered species.

The oldest fossils of silphids are known from the Middle Jurassic (~ 163 million years ago) Daohugou Bed in Northern China. Many Silphidae are flightless although they have wings. This loss is thought to be a result due to the changes in habitat over time. Researchers have found that most flight-capable species in this group feed on vertebrate carcasses, whereas flightless species will feed on soil invertebrates. They also found that egg production increased with flight loss because of a more limited food supply.

The word &quot;silphid&quot; or &quot;sylph&quot;, first seen in the sixteenth century in Paracelsus&#x27; works, refers to any race of spirits inhabiting the air and is described as mortal, but lacking soul. The word is also related to the Latin word &quot;silva&quot; meaning &quot;forests&quot; or &quot;of the woods&quot;.

==Diversity and distribution==
Silphidae are ubiquitous and are most abundant in the temperate zone. The diversity is also greater in the temperate zone and they are quite rare in the tropics although there are species endemic to the region. It is thought that ants, flies and other carrion feeders outcompete them in these regions. They vary in size from 7 to 45 mm.

There are about 46 different species of Silphidae in North America which include &quot;Heterosilpha ramosa&quot;, &quot;Necrodes surinamensis&quot;, &quot;Necrophila americana&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus americanus&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus carolinus&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus investigator&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus marginatus&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus orbicollis&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus tomentosus&quot;, &quot;Oiceoptoma inaequale&quot;, &quot;Oiceoptoma noveboracense&quot;, &quot;Oiceoptoma rugulosum&quot;, &quot;Thanatophilus lapponicus&quot;. A species found in Great Britain is &quot;Oiceoptoma thoracicum&quot;.

One species of &quot;Nicrophorus&quot;, &quot;Nicrophorus nepalensis&quot;, can be found primarily in the mountains of eastern Asia as well as along the Malay Archipelago. &quot;Nicrophorus nepalensis&quot; are found in the Indian subcontinent as well in the countries of India and Pakistan.

==Development==
Silphidae undergo holometabolous development. The development in the subfamily Silphinae proceeds at a slower rate than in Nicrophorinae. The Silphinae life cycle takes approximately twenty six to fifty eight days to go from an egg to adult. The breakdown of this process is essential to forensic entomologists. The cycle takes two to seven days after the egg is laid to hatch. The larvae will develop through three instars on the carrion lasting for ten to thirty days. After that time period is up the third instar larvae will venture away from the detritus to pupate. Pupation takes fourteen to twenty one days and is the major part of metamorphosis where a grandiose change occurs. During this stage the wings become fully developed and sexual maturity is reached, sometimes called the imago or adult stage where the cycle is then repeated. The Nicrophorinae cycle is generally quicker. Oviposition is done near the carcass and takes twelve to forty eight hours for the eggs to hatch into larvae. The amount of food and parental care exhibited help determine the length of the larval stage. Pupation in this subfamily lasts six to eight days and is completed in the soil. The adult Nicrophorinae will emerge from the soil and venture to find food and a mate.

==Reproduction==

Nicrophorinae are well known for the habit of locating a carcass and burying it by unearthing the soil underneath it. The burying behavior has seemingly evolved to prevent competition from other insects such as fly maggots. It has been observed that the cooperation of the two parent beetles leads to breeding success. More likely than not a breeding pair will work together, but in cases where there is large carrion males try to boost their reproduction by emitting pheromones. In this way, he will father more offspring, but the reproductive success of the primary female steadily declines. Sometimes, where there is a large carcass the likelihood of intense competition from flies leads to communal breeding. There appears to be a truce between females who would normally compete for the males, and in these cases cooperative behavior extends to females caring for each other&#x27;s offspring. At the height of breeding season pairs of beetles may compete for the carrion. The losing pair will be ejected from the carrion and if any eggs have been laid they are killed so the new female can lay her own.

==Behavior and ecology==

=== Food===

Silphid adults feed in a saprophagous manner: they colonize the carrion during all four stages of decomposition, which are fresh, bloated, decay, and dry. The main areas of decomposition for adults are during both the bloated and decaying stages. Silphid larvae mainly inhabit during the decaying and dry stages of the carrion. The primary food source for the subfamily Silphinae is the maggot mass present on the detritus. Nicrophorinae will colonize the body earlier in decomposition in order to avoid competition with maggots. If there is a sufficiently large maggot mass they will not colonize the carcass. The parental care exhibited by this subfamily is that the adult beetles regurgitate food into the mouths of the young larvae until they are mature. Silphinae colonize later in the decaying process and the adults eat the maggot mass, sometimes leaving little maggot evidence left to estimate a post-mortem interval. In the case of the sexton or burying beetles, Nicrophorinae, the adults will bury small animal carcasses and lay their eggs on it. In some species, a slight depression is made on the detritus for maturing larvae that the adult beetles feed and protect. In both subfamilies the larvae are observed to eat the decaying organic material while the adults mainly consume the maggots. Flies are the major competitor of silphids for detritus. If a carcass is infested with maggots, many of the Nicrophorinae will abandon the carcass while members of Silphinae will feed on the maggots.

===Defense===

Beetles have many different weapons available to protect them against predator attacks. The members of Silphidae have many different modifications that allow them to thrive in different ecological niches including colour warnings (from aposematism to Batesian mimicry), chemical defenses and parental care. Silphines are usually dark in color consisting of gold, black and brown. This dark coloring allows them to blend into their environment. Many nicrophorines have bright orange coloring on their elytra, which may serve as a warning to other predators. Some species secrete a chemical from a rectal gland that consists of aliphatic acids and terpene alcohols. The secretion has a strong, foul odor and may be topically irritating to cockroaches and flies. The species &quot;Necrodes surinamensis&quot; ejects this secretion as a spray and can rotate the end of its abdomen to spray in all directions.

===Locomotion and navigation===

Walking is the primary form of locomotion for Silphidae. They are able to travel great distances to find carcasses to breed and feed on. Beetles also have two sets of wings, the elytra and the hind wings. The hind wings are membranous and are modified for flying or swimming. There are some Silphidae who are able to fly, but others have lost this ability throughout evolution. When an animal dies, hydrogen sulfide and some cyclic compounds are released. Silphidae use their sense of smell to locate carcasses from a long distance by chemoreceptors on their antennae, which are adapted to detect these chemicals. At a short distance, the end organs of the palpi detect the odors. Silphid beetles are usually more active at night, nocturnal, which may help reduce competition.

===Competition===

Competition from other organisms for the carrion puts the silphids at both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that fly competitors lay eggs that result in maggots and supply food for silphids. The disadvantage for the Nicrophorinae is that if the carcass is already “blown”, referring to Shakespearean time as being infected with fly maggots, they will not colonize. Nicrophorinae have adapted to these situations and will bury the carcass to remove it from other competitors. With this technique, a steady food source is available for the larvae and procreation chances increase.

Silphidae compete for brooding areas. If an invader male overpowers the original male, it will mate with the original female and create a new brood. If an invader female overpowers the original female, it will also create a new brood with the primary male.

==Relationships==

=== With humans===

Silphids are usually not considered a nuisance to humans. They help the environment by laying their eggs on carcasses and the larvae break down the detritus, which prevents accumulation of deceased organisms.

Carcasses are kept out of sight and foul odors are prevented when Nicrophorinae bury it under the ground. This will also reduce the surface area for flies to lay their eggs and decrease fly population.

Some Silphidae species inhabit human-occupied areas and become pests to farmers by using crops as an additional source of nutrients. In Europe, &quot;Aclypea opaca&quot; feeds on beets, while &quot;Necrophila americana&quot; feeds on pumpkins, spinach, and sugar beets.

===With other organisms===

Members from the family Silphidae are known to have mutualistic relationships with other organisms. Nicrophorinae have a mutual relationship with phoretic mites. Mites from the genus &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; produce deutonymphs that crawl on Nicrophorinae and are transported to carrion. Once they arrive at the carrion, deutonymphs leave the adult Nicrophorinae and proceed to feed on nearby fly eggs and immature larvae. Mites help Nicrophorinae reduce the number of competitors on carrion. With less competition, both species are able to reproduce successfully underground.

Silphidae are known for being hosts to juvenile nematodes. &quot;Nicrophorus vespilloides&quot; are closely associated with the nematode parasite. The parasites can be easily transmitted to other hosts during copulation.

==Forensic research==

Silphidae are one of several families of forensic importance in the order Coleoptera. They are a very important tool in determining a post-mortem interval by collecting Silphid progeny from the carcass, and determining the developmental rate. Based on the number of instars and the larval development stage, a time of death can be estimated. This is very useful in medicocriminal entomology, the emphasis on utilizing arthropods as evidence to aid in solving crimes. Many of the methods in determining stages of development are subjective. However, recent studies have found a more precise way of determining the stage of development of Silphid larvae by measuring the maximum cranial width and other heavily sclerotized areas of the larvae instead of measuring just the length, which is subject to change with each larva, particularly in &quot;O. inaequale&quot; and &quot;N. surinamensis&quot;, which are more robust and have greater variations of length. The most accurate instar identification is possible by using distinct morphological features that are instar specific and cannot be affected by the size of the specimen. Although this is possible only for few species with described larvae of all instars, such as &quot;Thanatophilus rugosus&quot;.

Silphidae are being studied to find more exact estimations of post-mortem intervals and possible manners of death. Also, in the future, entomologists will explore the social behavior of the beetles to a greater degree. Members of family Silphidae are typically the first of the coleopterans to come in contact with carrion. Silphidae larvae are opportunistic predators that will feed on dipteran eggs, larvae, and on the carcass itself. This presents a problem in the determination of post-mortem interval because Silphidae are known to eradicate other species from carrion. By eliminating the first colonizing species Silphidae can give an incorrect post-mortem interval.

Unlike most of the insects used as forensic markers, it is possible to assess if Silphidae adults have colonized a corpse and left it later. For this purpose, some Parasitidae mites (for example, &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; species) are used due to their phoront-host specificity. If a corpse is invaded by &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; specimens and no Silphidae were sampled by forensic entomologists, it is reasonable to suspect that some Silphidae carrying &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; phoretic instars arrived previously to the corpse and abandoned it some time later, leaving &quot;Poecilochirus&quot; mites in the process.

<text>Boann or Boand is the Irish goddess of the River Boyne (&quot;Bóinn&quot;), an important river in Ireland&#x27;s historical province of Meath. According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; and &quot;Táin Bó Fraích&quot; she was the sister of Befind and daughter of Delbáeth, son of Elada, of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Her husband is variously Nechtan or Elcmar. With her lover the Dagda, she is the mother of Aengus.

== Etymology ==

Her name is interpreted as &quot;white cow&quot; (; ) in the &quot;dinsenchas&quot;, where she is also called &quot;White Boand&quot;. Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geography&quot; shows that in antiquity the river&#x27;s name was &quot;Bouvinda&quot; [Βουουίνδα], which may derive from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Bou-vindā&quot;, &quot;white cow&quot;. 
An alternate version of her name is given as Segais, hence Well of Segais. We are also told that Eithne was the wife of Elcmar and that another name for Eithne was Boand.

== Mythology ==

In the tale of Aengus&#x27;s birth, Boann lives at Brú na Bóinne with her husband Elcmar. She has an affair with the Dagda, who impregnates her after sending Elcmar away on a one-day errand. To hide the pregnancy from Elcmar, the Dagda casts a spell on him, making &quot;the sun stand still&quot; so he will not notice the passing of time. Meanwhile, nine months pass and Boann gives birth to Aengus. The &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; explains the name Aengus as meaning &quot;one desire&quot;, because the Dagda had been Boann&#x27;s one true desire. It has been suggested that this tale represents the winter solstice illumination of Newgrange at Brú na Bóinne, during which the sunbeam (the Dagda) enters the inner chamber (the womb of Boann) when the sun&#x27;s path stands still. The word &quot;solstice&quot; (Irish &quot;grianstad&quot;) means sun-standstill. The conception of Aengus may represent the &#x27;rebirth&#x27; of the sun at the winter solstice.

As told in the &quot;Dindsenchas&quot;, Boann created the Boyne. Though forbidden to by her husband, Nechtan, Boann approached the magical Well of Segais (also known as the Connla&#x27;s Well), which was surrounded, according to the legend, by nine magic hazel-trees. Hazelnuts were known to fall into the Well, where they were eaten by the speckled salmon (who, along with hazelnuts, also embody and represent wisdom in Irish mythology). Boann challenged the power of the well by walking around it tuathal; this caused the waters to surge up violently and rush down to the sea, creating the Boyne. In this catastrophe, she was swept along in the rushing waters, and lost an arm, leg and eye, and ultimately her life, in the flood. The poem equates her with famous rivers in other countries, including the River Severn, Tiber, Jordan River, Tigris and Euphrates. Additionally, it mentions alternate names for various parts of the Boyne, including River of Segais, the Arm and Leg of Nuada&#x27;s wife, the Great Silver Yoke, White Marrow of Fedlimid, the River of the White Hazel, Banna, Roof of the Ocean, Lunnand, and Torrand.

In a variant of the same story as told in the Dindsenchas, Boand tried to hide her infidelity with the Dagda by washing herself in Nechtan&#x27;s well, but when she approaches it, it overcomes her, and she drowns. 

She had a lapdog, Dabilla, which was swept out to sea. Torn into pieces by the water, the two halves became the rocks known as &quot;Cnoc Dabilla&quot;, or Hill of Dabilla.

She also appears in &quot;Táin Bó Fraích&quot; as the maternal aunt and protector of the mortal Fráech. In that story, Fráech&#x27;s people tell him to go visit his mother&#x27;s sister Boand to receive the raiment of the &quot;Sídhe&quot;. Boand then gives Fráech fifty intricately worked mantles and tunics with animal details, fifty jeweled spears that lit the night like the sun, fifty dark horses with gold bells, fifty swords with golden hilts, seven hounds in silver chains, seven trumpeters, three jesters, and three harpists, which Fráech uses to dazzle Medb and Ailill.

=== Buan ===

According to the story &quot;Cormac&#x27;s Adventure in the Land of Promise&quot;, there is a well in Tír na nÓg surrounded by nine purple hazel trees. Called the Well of Knowledge, it yields five streams that Manannán mac Lir later explains are the five senses from which knowledge is apprehended. The hazels, which drop nuts into a pool of five salmon, are called the hazels of &quot;Buan&quot;. The combination of the well, hazels, salmon and the name Buan (meaning &quot;enduring&quot; or &quot;persevering&quot;) likely points to a common origin with the story of Boand and the Well of Segais.

Another tale relates the fate of the only son of &quot;White Buan,&quot; here identified as a male. Buan&#x27;s son is named as Baile, loved by both men and women, who falls in love with Ailinn, daughter of Lugaid, son of Fergus of the Sea. The two lovers arrange a tryst, but before they can meet, Baile rests his chariot and releases his horses to graze. There he is intercepted by an unnamed character (likely Manannán in his trickster guise), described as a horrible apparition, approaching fitfully with the speed of a hawk or the wind from the green sea. When Baile asks the trickster from whence he comes and the reason for his haste, the trickster lies and tells Baile that he brings news of the death of Ailinn, who was killed by the warriors of Leinster and that she and her lover will only be reunited in death. With that news Baile drops dead on the spot, and a yew grows on his grave with the form of Baile&#x27;s head at its top. The trickster moves on to intercept Ailinn, whom he tells of the death of Baile. With that news, Ailinn drops dead on the spot, and an apple tree grows on her grave with the form of her head at its top. The two trees are eventually cut down, turned into tablets, and inscribed with poems. On Halloween there was a poet&#x27;s competition in Cormac&#x27;s court, and the two tablets were brought together. When they met, they sprang together and intertwined as woodbine around a branch.

Another Buan, named the wife of the one-armed King Mesgegra of Leinster, dies of grief after Conall Cernach beheads her husband. A hazel tree then grows through her grave.

== In Neopaganism ==

Modern-day commentators and Modern Paganism sometimes identify Boann with the goddess Brigid or believe Boann to be Brigid&#x27;s mother; however there are no Celtic sources that describe her as such. It is also speculated by some modern writers that, as the more well-known goddess, and later saint, the legends of numerous &quot;minor&quot; goddesses with similar associations may have over time been incorporated into the symbology, worship and tales of Brigid.

<text>In Irish mythology, Elcmar or Ecmar (modern spelling: Ealcmhar) is the husband of Boann and belongs to the divine Tuatha Dé Danann. It has been suggested that he is Nuada under another name, and he is sometimes confused with Nechtan, Boann&#x27;s usual husband. At first glance he appears to be associated with horses but there is also a school of thought that says his name means The Evil One. In the Dindsenchas, he is called &quot;lord of horses&quot; and is described as a judge. Elcmar is described as having a fork of white hazel, a gold brooch, and a cloak.

==Chief steward==

According to the Yellow Book of Lecan, Elcmar served as chief steward for Dagda, one of the most important and powerful of the Danann. His wife was Boann, goddess of the River Boyne, who developed a great passion for the Dagda. To consummate this union, Dagda sent Elcmar to High King Bres on an errand around the time of Imbolc. Boann, like her Greek counterpart Alcmene, got pregnant. To protect the sensibilities of his steward and the life of the child, the Dagda held the sun still for nine months so Boann&#x27;s pregnancy lasted only one day; elsewhere, the Dagda kept hunger, thirst, and darkness from Elcmar during his journey, so that it only seemed to be a day for Elcmar. Boann named the baby Mac Og and gave him to the Dagda. The child was reared by his foster father, Midir, safely away from any retribution that Elcmar might desire.

Elcmar and Oengus mac Og eventually meet when the Dagda passes out the sithens and omits giving one to Oengus. To make up for his mistake, the Dagda tells Oengus how to trick Elcmar out of the Brugh na Boinne. On Samhain Oengus challenges him to a duel and defeats him but spares his life if Elcmar will give him the Brugh for day and night. For his life Elcmar accepts the offer.

The absence of an article leads to Elcmar losing the Brugh to Oengus, since Old Irish lacks indefinite articles, so the same phrase means both &quot;a day and a night&quot; (24 hours) and &quot;day and night&quot; (always). To placate his steward the Dagda gives him another sithen. There is no love lost between Elcmar and Oengus, and Elcmar is present during the infamous hurling match that results in Midir losing his eye.

Although Boann is not named specifically as the mother of Englec, the daughter of Elcmar, there are no tales of Boann ever leaving her husband. Englec develops an incestual passion for her half brother, although she has never seen him. Slipping away to a hurling match where she expects to see Oengus, she ends up being carried off by Midir.

Englec winds up Midir&#x27;s lover. Elcmar kills Midir afterwards. In turn, Oengus kills Elcmar for killing Midir.

Another of Elcmar&#x27;s daughters is named as Fea, who becomes the wife of Neit.

<text>Nechtan is a figure in Irish mythology who is associated with a spring marking the source of the River Boyne, known as Nechtan&#x27;s Well or the Well of Wisdom. He was the husband of Boann, eponymous goddess of the Boyne. Nechtan is believed to be another name for Nuada.

==Etymology==
According to Georges Dumézil the name &quot;Nechtan&quot; is perhaps cognate with that of the Romano-British god Nodens or the Roman god called Neptunus and the Persian and Vedic gods sharing the name Apam Napat.

The name could ultimately be derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*nepot-&quot; &quot;descendant, sister&#x27;s son&quot;, or, alternatively, from &quot;nebh-&quot; &quot;damp, wet&quot;. Another etymology suggests that &quot;Nechtan&quot; is derived from Old-Irish &quot;necht&quot; &quot;clean, pure and white&quot;, with a root &quot;-neg&quot; &quot;to wash&quot;, from IE &quot;neigu̯-&quot; &quot;to wash&quot; As such, the name would be closely related mythological beings, who were dwelling near wells and springs: English neck (from Anglosaxon &quot;nicor&quot;), Swedish &quot;Näck&quot;, German &quot;Nixe&quot; and Dutch &quot; nikker&quot;, meaning &quot;river monster, water spirit&quot;, hence Old-Norse &quot;nykr&quot; &quot;water spirit in the form of a horse&quot;.

==Description==
He inhabited the otherworldly Síd Nechtain, the mythological form of Carbury Hill. In the Dindsenchas Nechtan is described as the husband of Boann and the son of Nuadu. Elsewhere in the Dindsenchas Nechtan is said to be the son of Labraid or called &quot;mac Namat&quot;. Similarly in the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; Nechtan is named along with his brother Caicher as the sons of Nama, sons of Eochu Garb, but Caicher is elsewhere in the same text named as the son of Nuada.

Only Nechtan and his three cup-bearers named Flesc, Lam, and Luam were permitted to visit the &quot;Tobar Segais&quot; or &quot;Well of Wisdom&quot; into which nine sacred hazel trees dropped their wisdom-bearing nuts. In that well swam the Salmon of Wisdom, which ate the hazelnuts. Eating one of the salmon could in turn imbue a person with knowledge of all things.

In the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; Nechtan killed Cairpre and was in turn killed by Sigmall, the grandson of Midir.

==Legacy==
&quot;Nechtan&quot; or &quot;Nectan&quot; became a common Celtic name and a number of historical or legendary figures bear it. Nechtan was a frequent name for Pictish kings. Nectan of Hartland, said to have lived in the 5th century AD, is the patron saint of Hartland, Devon. Some however argue that St. Nectan never existed as a historical person, but was instead a Christianized form of the god Nechtan.

St Nectan&#x27;s Kieve in St Nectan&#x27;s Glen near Tintagel, Cornwall is said to be named for St. Nectan - though this is a Victorian invention. The place was called Nathan&#x27;s Cave in 1799. and was named after a local landowner.

The name MacNaughton derives from &quot;MacNeachdainn&quot;, meaning &quot;Son of Nechtan.&quot;

<text>Diarmuid Ua Duibhne (, ), also known as Diarmuid of the Love Spot, is a hero and demigod in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology, traditionally thought to be set in the 2nd to 4th century.
He is the son of Donn, son of Duibhne of the Fianna, and Cochrann, daughter of Cathaír Mór.
Diarmuid becomes the foster son and protégé of Aengus Óg, one of the Tuatha Dé Danann and the god of love, to the extent that a god of love can be said to exist in the corpus.
He grows up to be a skilled warrior and a well-liked, valued member of the Fianna who on one occasion saves Fionn and his band by single-handedly slaying over three thousand enemies in battle.

Diarmuid is best known as the lover of Gráinne, the intended wife of Fianna leader Fionn mac Cumhaill in the legend &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;. Among his sons were Donnchadh, Iollann, Ruchladh and Ioruad.

Diarmuid Ua Duibhne is said to be the founder of the Scottish Clan Campbell. On the Campbell crest is a boar&#x27;s head, a reference to Diarmuid&#x27;s geis and death.

==Legend==

===Family===
Diarmuid is a scion of the Fianna in both the paternal and the maternal line. His father&#x27;s name is usually given as Donn, sometimes Corc; Duibhne of the Fianna is his paternal grandfather. His mother is Cochrann, Cróchnat or Crochnuit, daughter of Cathaír Mór and close relative of Fionn&#x27;s herself.
Around the time of Diarmuid&#x27;s birth, his father is banished from the Fianna on account of an unspecified dispute. Diarmuid is taken in by Aengus Óg, to be raised in Aengus&#x27; house at Brú na Bóinne.

===Curse===
When Crochnuit later bears a son to Roc Diocain following an adulterous affair, Fionn&#x27;s steward, Aengus, accepts Diarmuid&#x27;s new half brother as his foster son as well. Donn has refused to accept the child into his household for the stated reason of the father being a commoner.

Attending a dinner party hosted by Aengus at Brú na Bóinne, Donn becomes jealous when the household lavishes the son of Roc with as much attention as his own son. He kills the steward&#x27;s son, Congus, when no one is looking, but is eventually identified as the murderer through magical means. Roc suggests killing Diarmuid in retaliation but is prevented from immediately doing so by Aengus. With the help of a druid, Roc later resurrects his dead son in the form of a boar, then puts the boar under bonds to bring Diarmuid to death.

===Ball Seirce===
Diarmuid grows up to become a strong warrior. He is given a place among the Fianna and accomplishes many great deeds in their service, on one occasion fighting a wild ox for seven consecutive days and nights. He is popular with women.

After one of their hunting trips, Diarmuid and his companions discover they have ventured so far they are unable to get back home for the night. Aimlessly walking through the woods, they encounter a dwelling inhabited by an old man, a young girl, and a cat. The old man invites the group to dinner. Diarmuid and his friends prove their prowess by wrestling a wether – they lose, but only barely, and only because the wether fights with &quot;the strength of the world&quot;, whose embodiment it turns out to be. The wether is ultimately subdued by the cat, a personification of death. 

The group retires to bed. The men, one after the other, attempt to sleep with the young girl. The girl, who turns out to be a personification of youth, rejects the men – all of them in some versions, all of them except Diarmuid in others – on the grounds that she belonged to them once and cannot belong to them again. She does mark Diarmuid with the , a magical love spot that makes him irresistible to any woman who lays eyes on him.

===King Under-Wave===
One snowy winter night an unkempt and repugnant woman, &quot;very wild and ugly&quot;, appears at the lodge of the Fianna and requests to share one of the men&#x27;s bedsteads. She is rejected by all but Diarmuid. She makes additional demands on the group&#x27;s hospitality, which Diarmuid points out are impertinent given her appearance but grants regardless. In the morning, the visitor has magically become young and beautiful, and a grand new house has magically appeared on a nearby hill, &quot;ready for them, with food and servants; and everything they could wish for.&quot; Overjoyed, Diarmuid asks the woman to move into the new house with him. She agrees on one condition: he cannot say out loud how ugly she looked on the night they met, at least not three times.

After three days in his new house, Diarmuid grows restless. The woman encourages him to join his comrades for the day. She promises to take good care of Diarmuid&#x27;s beloved greyhound and her three new pups. While Diarmuid spends the day hunting, however, one of the Fianna manipulates the woman into giving him one of the pups. Returning home, Diarmuid gets upset and mentions the repellent state the woman arrived in. The following two days, the Fianna convince the woman to give away the remaining two pups, and Diarmuid again brings up her former ugliness. The third time he does so, the woman and the house disappear, and the greyhound dies. Carrying his dead dog, Diarmuid sets out to search for his lady.

An enchanted ship carries Diarmuid &quot;out over the sea, and then down below it&quot;, to the otherworldly &quot;Land-under-Waves&quot;. Walking its plains, he finds and collects three drops of blood. He also learns that the daughter of King Under-Wave has just returned home from abroad. She has been under some form of enchantment for seven years and is now gravely ill, beyond the help of physicians. The daughter turns out to be Diarmuid&#x27;s lady. She is overjoyed to see Diarmuid again but states that she will never be well again – partly because of the drop of blood from her heart she lost every time she thought of him on her way home, partly because the cure for her illness consists in three draughts from
the cup of the King of Magh an Ionganaidh, the faraway Plain of Wonder. Diarmuid leaves to retrieve the cup.

With the assistance of a mysterious &quot;low-sized, reddish man&quot;, Diarmuid reaches the dun of the King of the Plain of Wonder and demands the cup. The kings sends multiple waves of fighting men, whom Diarmuid slays in many hours of battle. Having lost his army, the king himself emerges. Having learned that Diarmuid is a man of the Fianna of Ireland, the king realizes that Diarmuid is fulfilling a prophecy and willingly parts with his cup. 

The &quot;red man&quot; instructs Diarmuid in the use of the cup but warns him that, along with her sickness, Diarmuid&#x27;s love for the King&#x27;s daughter will be gone. He identifies himself as a messenger from beyond the world who has come to Diarmuid&#x27;s help because Diarmuid&#x27;s &quot;own heart is hot to come to the help of another&quot;. He further warns Diarmuid not to accept the &quot;great riches&quot; the King will offer him for healing his daughter but to ask only for a ship to bring him home to Ireland. The red man&#x27;s prediction turns out to be correct. Diarmuid departs. In some versions of the story, the King&#x27;s daughter restored the greyhound to life as a farewell gift.

===Diarmuid and Gráinne===

Fionn has been without female companionship since the death of his wife Maighneis, daughter of Black Garraidh. His son Oisin offers to bring him any woman, &quot;willing or unwilling&quot;, Fionn will care to indicate. Diorraing the Druid suggests that the best woman for Fionn would be Gráinne, daughter of Cormac mac Airt, the High King of Ireland, &quot;the woman of the best make and shape ... in the whole world&quot;. Fionn sends Osin and Diorraing to ask for Gráinne&#x27;s hand in marriage. Citing tension between Cormac and himself, he stays behind. Cormac leave the decision to Gráinne, who at first accepts but develops second thoughts when she meets Fionn and notices his advanced age. At the wedding feast, Diarmuid catches her eye. She makes most of those present fall asleep using enchanted wine and asks Diarmuid to abscond with her. When Diarmuid refuses, she puts a spell on him. Diarmuid is magically compelled to leave the party, Gráinne in tow, knowing full well that Fionn will hunt the two of them down. Diarmuid and Gráinne cross the Sionnan and hide in the Doire-da-Bhoth, the Wood of the Two Huts.
When Fionn wakes up in the morning, he is gripped by &quot;a scorching jealously&quot; and immediately sends his trackers after the couple. The trackers, many of them loyal friends of Diarmuid&#x27;s, declare themselves unable to carry the track across the Sionnan until Fionn threatens them with execution. Once across the Sionnan, Fionn guesses that the couple are hiding in the Wood of the Two Huts. Diarmuid&#x27;s friends arrange for multiple warnings to be sent to Diarmuid, but Diarmuid chooses to stand and confront Fionn, much to Gráinne&#x27;s dismay.

Diarmuid&#x27;s protector Aengus Óg is given a vision of the danger Diarmuid is in, magically rushed to the Wood, and offers to sneak him out of his hideout under his cloak. Diarmuid declines but convinces Aengus to save Gráinne. Aengus brings Gráinne to Ros-da-Shoileach, the Headland of the Two Sallows. Diarmuid&#x27;s friends offer to let him escape, but Diarmuid declines again; he does not wish to bring Fionn&#x27;s wrath down upon them. He identifies the exact spot where Fionn himself would be facing him, then vaults across Fionn and his immediate retinue with the assistance of his spear. He joins Aengus and Gráinne in Ros-da-Shoileach. Aengus makes it clear to him that he will be on the run for the rest of his life.
Diarmuid and Gráinne travel on, fording rivers, crossing marshes, sleeping in caves. A young man named Muadhan volunteers to become their servant; he turns out to be of miraculous strength. Diarmuid encounters a great fleet of ships carrying three kings of the Green Champions. The kings, who have been summoned by Fionn to catch Diarmuid, are travelling with twenty hundred good fighting men and three invulnerable magical hounds. Diarmuid denies being Diarmuid but hints he may be in the general vicinity. On two consecutive nights, he shows off great and dangerous feats of strength. He manipulates large numbers of men into killing themselves trying to emulate him. On the third night, he kills most of the fighting men remaining, eventually subduing the kings themselves and tying them up. The kings are found by a woman messenger of Fionn&#x27;s, who is however unable to loosen the ropes they are bound with. The kings manage, using their hounds, to track him down. Muadhan kills the dogs using magic, and Diarmuid kills the last few fighting men. The kings are slowly crushed to death by their ropes. Only the messenger survives.

In the centre of the Forest of Dubros were magical berries from the rowan tree that could restore the youth of an old person, guarded by the giant Searbhan on the instructions of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Diarmuid and Gráinne asked Searbhan if they could live and hunt game in the forest. Searbhan agreed on the condition that they would not eat the berries. Gráinne asked to eat the berries. Searbhan refused and attacked Diarmuid with his massive club. Diarmuid used Searbhan&#x27;s own weapon to kill him.

Fionn gathered the Fianna and travelled to the wood where he had a fidchell board set up, and played his son Oisín. Oscar and Cailte assisted Oisín in the game, since no one except Diarmuid was a match against Fionn in this game. Diarmuid watched the game from above, and couldn&#x27;t resist aiding Oisín in the game by tossing berries at the pieces. Fionn lost three straight matches to his son. Fionn realised that the couple were hiding in the tree and ordered men to kill his rival. Diarmuid killed seven warriors named Garbh. Oscar, Fionn&#x27;s grandson, warned that anyone who harmed Diarmuid would face his anger, and escorted the couple safely away through the forest.

Fionn went to the Land of Promise to ask his old nurse Bodhmall to kill Diarmuid. Diarmuid was hunting in the forest beside the river Boyne and Bodhmall flew through the air on a flying water-lily and hurled poisoned darts that could penetrate his shield and armour. Diarmuid suffered agony where the darts struck him; he killed her with the Gáe Dearg.

Fionn pardoned Diarmuid after Aonghus Óg interceded on the couple&#x27;s behalf; Diarmuid and Gráinne lived in peace at Ceis Chorainn in present-day County Sligo for several years. They had five children, four sons and a daughter. Diarmuid built a fort, Rath Gráinia. However, they went for years without visiting Grainne&#x27;s father Cormac Mac Art and Diarmuid&#x27;s former comrades. Gráinne persuaded Diarmuid to invite their friends and relations to a feast, including Fionn and the Fianna. Fionn invited Diarmuid on a boar hunt on the heath of Benn Gulbain; Diarmuid only took his short sword Beagalltach and his yellow spear, Gáe Buide, not his best weapons. He was gored by a giant boar which had already killed a number of men and hounds.

Water drunk from Fionn&#x27;s hands had the power of healing, but when Fionn gathered water, he twice let it run through his fingers before he could bring it to Diarmuid. Threatened by his son Oisín and grandson Oscar, he fetched water a third time, but this time he was too late: Diarmuid had died.

After Diarmuid&#x27;s death, Aengus took his body back to the Brugh, where he breathed life into it whenever he wished to speak with the hero.

Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne has often been compared with the earlier love triangle between Deirdre, Noísi and King Conchobar of Ulster, &quot;Longes mac nUislenn&quot; (The Exile of the Sons of Uisliu), which is part of the Ulster Cycle.

===Famous weapons===

Manannán mac Lir, a sea god, presents Aengus Óg with an invincible magical sword named either Móralltach or Nóralltach, the Great Fury.
In The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne it is said of Móralltach that it left no stroke nor blow unfinished at the first trial.
Aengus passes Móralltach on to Diarmuid, along with a second sword, Beagalltach, the Little Fury.

Diarmuid also owns several other weapons known by specific names, including Gáe Buidhe, the Yellow Spear, Crann Buidhe, the Yellow Shaft, and Gáe Dearg, the Red Spear. The spears inflict wounds that cannot be healed. Diarmuid uses Móralltach and Gáe Dearg for adventures that are matters of life and death, Beagalltach and Gáe Buidhe and lesser battles.

==In popular culture==

One of the many craters on Europa named after Celtic figures is named specifically after Diarmuid.

<text>Caer (; or &quot;&quot;) is a placename element in Welsh meaning &quot;stronghold&quot;, &quot;fortress&quot;, or &quot;citadel&quot;, roughly equivalent to an Old English suffix (&quot;-ceaster&quot;) now variously written as , , and.

In modern Welsh orthography, caer is usually written as a prefix, although it was formerly—particularly in Latin—written as a separate word. The Breton equivalent is &quot;kêr&quot;, which is present in many Breton placenames as the prefix &quot;Ker-&quot;.

==Etymology==

The term is thought to have derived from the Brittonic *&quot;kagro-&quot; and to be cognate with &quot;cae&quot; (&quot;field, enclosed piece of land&quot;). Although stone castles were largely introduced to Wales by the invading Normans, &quot;caer&quot; was and remains used to describe the settlements around some of them as well. An example is the Roman fort at Caernarfon, formerly known in Welsh as &#x27; from its position on the Seiont; the later Edwardian castle and its community were distinguished as &#x27; (&quot;fort in Arfon&quot;, the latter being a district name (Cantref Arfon) from &quot;ar Fôn&quot;, &quot;(land) opposite Môn or Anglesey&quot;). However, the modern names of the Roman fort and Edwardian castle themselves are now &#x27; or &#x27;, while the communities carry on the name &quot;caer&quot;.

Note that the term is not believed to be related to the Irish &quot;cathair&quot; (&quot;city&quot;), which is instead derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;katrixs&quot;, *&quot;catarax&quot; (&quot;fortification&quot;).

== Britain ==
Gildas&#x27;s account of the Saxon invasions of Britain claimed that there were 28 fortified Roman cities () on the island, without listing them. The &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally attributed to Nennius includes a list of the 28, all of which are called &quot;caer&quot;. Controversy exists over whether this list includes only Roman cities or a mixture of Roman cities and non-Roman settlements. Some of the place names that have been proposed include:

* Cair Brithon (&quot;Fort of the Britons&quot;: Dumbarton in Strathclyde)
* Cair Caratauc (&quot;Fort Rampart&quot;: Salisbury? Sellack?)
* Cair Ceint (&quot;Fort Kent&quot;: Canterbury)
* Cair Celemion (Camalet? Silchester?)
* Cair Colun (&quot;Fort Colonia&quot;: Colchester?)
* Cair Custoeint (&quot;Fort Constantius or Constantine&quot;: Caernarfon; or a Devonian hillfort)
* Cair Daun (&quot;Fort Don&quot;: Doncaster)
* Cair Draitou (Drayton? Dunster?)
* Cair Ebrauc (&quot;Fort York&quot;: York)
* Cair Grauth (&quot;Fort Granta&quot;: Cambridge)
* Cair Guent (&quot;Fort Venta&quot;: Caerwent or Winchester)
* Cair Guinntguic (&quot;Fort Venta&quot;: Winchester? Norwich or Winwick?)
* Cair Guiragon (&quot;Fort Weorgoran&quot;: Worcester)
* Cair Guorthigirn (&quot;Fort Vortigern&quot;: Little Doward? Carmarthen?)
* Cair Guricon (Warwick? Wroxeter?)
* Cair Legeion Guar Usic (&quot;Fort Legion on the Usk&quot;: Caerleon-upon-Usk)
* Cair Legion (&quot;Fort Legion&quot;: Chester)
* Cair Lerion (&quot;Fort Leir&quot;: Leicester)
* Cair Ligualid (&quot;Fort Luguwalos&quot;: Carlisle)
* Cair Luit Coyt (&quot;Fort Grey Wood&quot;: Wall)
* Cair Lundem (&quot;Fort Londinium&quot;: London)
* Cair Maunguid (Manchester?)
* Cair Meguaid (&quot;Fort Mediolanum&quot;: Meifod? Llanfyllin? Caersws? in Powys)
* Cair Mincip (&quot;Fort Municipium&quot;: )
* Cair &#x27;Pensa vel Coyt&#x27; (&quot;Fort Penselwood&quot;: Exeter? Ilchester?)
* Cair Peris (Portchester? Builth Wells?)
* Cair Segeint (&quot;Fort Seiont&quot;: Caernarfon; or Silchester)
* Cair Urnarc (Wroxeter? Dorchester?)

<doc id="85908" wikidata="Q381126" url="?curid=85908" title="Erecura">
<text>Erecura or Aerecura (also found as &quot;Herecura&quot; or &quot;Eracura&quot;) was a goddess worshipped in ancient times, often thought to be Celtic in origin, mostly represented with the attributes of Proserpina and associated with the Roman underworld god Dis Pater, as on an altar from Sulzbach. She appears with Dis Pater in a statue found at Oberseebach, Switzerland, and in several magical texts from Austria, once in the company of Cerberus and once probably with Ogmios. A further inscription to her has been found near Stuttgart, Germany. Besides her chthonic symbols, she is often depicted with such attributes of fertility as the cornucopia and apple baskets. She is believed to be similar to Greek Hecate, while the two goddesses share similar names. She is depicted in a seated posture, wearing a full robe and bearing trays or baskets of fruit, in depictions from Cannstatt and Sulzbach. Miranda Green calls Aericura a &quot;Gaulish Hecuba&quot;, while Noémie Beck characterizes her as a &quot;land-goddess&quot; sharing both underworld and fertility aspects with Dis Pater.

Representations of Erecura are most commonly found in the Danubian area of Southern Germany and Slovenia, but they also occur in Italy, Great Britain, and France. Her inscriptions are concentrated in Stuttgart and along the Rhine. Several monuments in honour of Erecura occur in cemeteries or other funereal contexts. Jona Lendering notes the similarity between her iconography and that of Nehalennia, who was worshipped in Germania Inferior, while Beck sees no significant difference between her attributes and those of the Matres and Matronae. Geographically, the areas in which Erecura and Dis Pater were worshipped appear to be in complementary distribution with those where the cult of Sucellus and Nantosuelta is attested, and Beck suggests that these cults were functionally similar although iconographically distinct.

A male deity called Arecurius or Aericurus is named on an altar-stone in Northumberland, England, although Beck cautions that &quot;this inscription is quite uncertain, and it might be a misreading of Mercurio&quot;.

==Etymology==

The is of unclear origin. It has been connected with Latin &quot;aes, aeris&quot; &#x27;copper, bronze, money, wealth&#x27;, &quot;era&quot; &#x27;mistress&#x27; and the name of the Greek goddess Hera. Many different Latinised forms of this goddess&#x27;s name occur: &quot;Aeraecura&quot; at Perugia; &quot;Aerecura&quot; at Mainz, Xanten, Aquileia and Roşia Montană; &quot;Aericura&quot; at Sulzbach, Malsch, &quot;Eracura&quot; in Mautern, Austria, &quot;Ercura&quot; at Fliehburg, &quot;Erecura&quot; at Cannstatt and Belley in Aube; &quot;Heracura&quot; at Stockstadt am Rhein, &quot;Herecura&quot; at Cannstatt, Freinsheim and Rottenburg am Neckar, where the form &quot;Herequra&quot; is also found.

The alternation between the initial H and A may be due to the letters&#x27; similar shape in the classical Latin capitals ordinarily used in epigraphic inscriptions in the Roman Empire, particularly since less literate members of the Roman Empire’s community sometimes misinterpreted the phonemic value of a given letter. A name of the form or appears to underlie the alternations &quot;Aeraecura&quot; ~ &quot;Aerecura&quot; ~ &quot;Aericura&quot; ~ &quot;Eracura&quot; ~ &quot;Ercura&quot; ~ &quot;Erecura&quot; ~ &quot;Heracura&quot; ~ &quot;Herecura&quot; ~ &quot;Herequra&quot;.

Though the goddess herself may be Celtic, it is open to question whether the name is of Celtic origin or even Indo-European. Lendering considers her cult to be of Illyrian origin, spreading from Aquileia and only reaching the Danubian and Rhenish border regions through the Roman troops deployed there. Beck considers the name to be of Germanic origin.

<doc id="85911" wikidata="Q4694262" url="?curid=85911" title="*Agronā">
<text>[[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]Agronā was a hypothetical reconstructed Proto-Celtic name for the River Ayr in Scotland, later applied to the River Aeron in Wales. The claim is linguistic and first appeared in William J. Watson&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Placenames of Scotland&quot; (1926). Watson suggested the River Ayr in Scotland could be worked back to a hypothetical Proto-Celtic &quot;river goddess of slaughter and carnage&quot; and that the deity name was &quot;*Agronā&quot;. At that time there were many questionable Scottish nationalist attempts to use the River Ayr place-name to claim Taliesin&#x27;s battle poems for Scotland and Watson&#x27;s derivation strongly and implicitly supported such claims. This hypothesis has also been used to support locating the ancient kingdom of Aeron in modern-day Ayrshire.

Two years after Watson, Eilert Ekwall in his &quot;English River-Names&quot; (1928) instead derived the River Ayr simply from the root &quot;*Ara&quot; (but see his discussion of the Aeron under the entry for the Yorkshire River Aire). However, the earlier claim that the river&#x27;s name literally means &quot;carnage&quot; persisted. The derivation from &quot;carnage&quot; has become casually conflated with the similarly named Welsh river Aeron. Pughe&#x27;s 1803 &quot;Dictionary of the Welsh Language&quot; states that the &quot;Aeron&quot; name for rivers in living Welsh meant &quot;Queen of Brightness&quot;.

<doc id="85913" wikidata="Q4696532" url="?curid=85913" title="Aibell">
<text>In Irish legend Aibell (sometimes Aoibheall (modern Irish spelling)), also anglicised as Aeval or Eevill) was a Pre-Christian goddess from the Irish mythology of Munster and the guardian spirit of the Dál gCais, the Delbhna, and the Clan Ó Bríen. She was demoted in popular belief, following the Christianisation of Gaelic Ireland, from a goddess to the Fairy Queen ruling over the Celtic Otherworld of Thomond, or north Munster. The entrance to her kingdom was believed to be at Craig Liath, the grey rock, a hill overlooking the Shannon about two miles north of Killaloe. Aibell also had a lover (called Dubhlainn Ua Artigan) and a magic harp (of which it was said &quot;[w]hoever heard its music did not live long afterwards&quot;). In Irish folklore she was turned into a white cat by her sister, Clíodhna and is alleged to have appeared in a dream on the night before the Battle of Clontarf to Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, and prophesied his imminent death and that whichever of his sons he saw first would succeed him. In Modern literature in Irish, Aibell appears in many immortal 18th century Aisling poems composed in Munster Irish. Aibell also serves as the main antagonist in the very famous long comic poem (, &quot;The Midnight Court&quot;) by Brian Merriman, in which she is the presiding judge during an Otherworldly lawsuit, in which the women of Ireland are suing the men for refusing to marry and father children.

==Name==
The name Aoibheall may come from Gaelic &quot;aoibh&quot;, meaning &quot;beauty&quot; (or &quot;aoibhinn&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot;). Alternatively, as a theonym it could be derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Oibel-ā&quot;, literally &quot;burning fire&quot;, which may have been a byword for the notion of &quot;ardour&quot;; the Romano-British equivalent of this Proto-Celtic theonym is likely to have been *&quot;Oebla&quot;. A variant name for the character is Áebinn.

==Attestations==

===&quot;An Buachaill Caol Dubh&quot;===
In Seán Ó Seanacháin&#x27;s song &quot;An Buachaill Caol Dubh&quot;, Aoibheal appears to the &quot;Dark Slender Boy&quot; (representing alcohol addiction) and his friend the drinker. In the last verse Seanacháin expands by saying that, when Aoibheal met the two of them walking the road, she promised the lad a hundred men if he would let go of the poet. The lad replied that he was steadfast and true and would not desert his friends until they died. Thus Seán acknowledges his addiction will never disappear.

===Lady Gregory===
===&quot;Cúirt An Mheán Oíche&quot;===
Aoibheal also features prominently in the 18th-century comic poem &quot;Cúirt An Mheán Oíche&quot; by Brian Merriman. The poem begins by using the conventions of the Aisling, or vision poem, in which the poet is out walking when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, this woman is Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her &#x27;sons&#x27; to rebel against foreign tyranny. In Merriman&#x27;s hands, the convention is made to take a satirical and deeply ironic twist.

In the opening section of the poem, a hideous female giant appears to the poet and drags him kicking and screaming to the court of Queen Aoibheal of the Fairies. On the way to the ruined monastery at Moinmoy, the messenger explains that the Queen, disgusted by the twin corruptions of Anglo-Irish landlords and English Law, has taken the dispensing of justice upon herself. There follows a traditional court case under the Brehon law form of a three-part debate.

In the first part, a young woman calls on Aoibheal declares her case against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She complains that, despite increasingly desperate attempts to capture a husband via intensive flirtation at hurling matches, wakes, and pattern days, the young men insist on ignoring her in favour of late marriages to much older women. The young woman further bewails the contempt with which she is treated by the married women of the village.

She is answered by an old man who first denounces the wanton promiscuity of young women in general, suggesting that the young woman who spoke before was conceived by a Tinker under a cart. He vividly describes the infidelity of his own young wife. He declares his humiliation at finding her already pregnant on their wedding night and the gossip which has surrounded the &quot;premature&quot; birth of &quot;his&quot; son ever since. He disgustedly attacks the dissolute lifestyles of young women in general. Then, however, he declares that there is nothing wrong with his illegitimate children and denounces marriage as &quot;out of date.&quot; He demands that the Queen outlaw it altogether and replace it with a system of free love.

The young woman, however, is infuriated by the old&#x27; man&#x27;s words and is barely restrained from physically attacking him. She mocks his impotent failure to fulfill his marital duties with his young wife, who was a homeless beggar who married him to avoid starvation. The young woman then argues that if his wife has taken a lover, she well deserves one. The young woman then calls for the abolition of priestly celibacy, alleging that priests would otherwise make wonderful husbands and fathers. In the meantime, however, she will keep trying to attract an older man in hopes that her unmarried humiliation will finally end.

Finally, in the judgement section Queen Aoibheal rules that all laymen must marry before the age of 21, on pain of corporal punishment at the hands of Ireland&#x27;s women. She advises them to equally target the romantically indifferent, homosexuals, and skirt chasers who boast of the number of women they have used and discarded. Aoibheal tells them to be careful, however, not to leave any man unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is something only the Vatican can do and counsels patience.

To the poet&#x27;s horror, the younger woman angrily points him out as a 30-year-old bachelor and describes her many failed attempts to attract his interest in hopes of becoming his wife. She declares that he must be the first man to suffer the consequences of the new marriage law. As a crowd of infuriated women prepares to flog him into a quivering bowl of jelly, he awakens to find it was all a terrible nightmare.

<doc id="85917" wikidata="Q665752" url="?curid=85917" title="Rapier (missile)">
<text>Rapier is a surface-to-air missile developed for the British Army to replace their towed Bofors 40/L70 anti-aircraft guns. The system is unusual as it uses a manual optical guidance system, sending guidance commands to the missile in flight over a radio link. This results in a high level of accuracy, therefore a large warhead is not required.

Entering service in 1971, it eventually replaced all other anti-aircraft weapons in British Army service; both the Bofors guns used against low-altitude targets and the Thunderbird missile used against longer-range and higher-altitude targets. As the expected air threat moved from medium-altitude strategic missions to low-altitude strikes, the fast reaction time and high manoeuvrability of the Rapier made it more effective than either of these weapons, replacing most of them by 1977.

Rapier was later selected by the RAF Regiment to replace their Bofors guns and Tigercat missiles. It also saw international sales. In October 2021, it was replaced as one of the UK&#x27;s primary air-defence weapons by Sky Sabre.

==History==
===Earlier systems===
The introduction of medium-range surface-to-air missiles, or surface-to-air guided weapons (SAGW) as they are known in the UK, had made flying at medium or high altitudes anywhere near the front line near suicidal. In response, air forces began introducing aircraft and weapons meant to be used at low altitudes, in nap-of-the-earth flying that used landforms to block the view of the aircraft from the radar systems on the missiles.

By the late 1950s, the British Army considered this threat considerable as new aircraft like the Sukhoi Su-7 became common and higher performance designs were in the pipeline. Against low-flying aircraft, only anti-aircraft guns were suitable, as they could be quickly swung and fired in seconds. However, the relatively short range of their Bofors 40/L56 guns meant they had only a very short period of time in which the aircraft was close enough to fire on.

To improve this, the Army began the development of a massively improved weapon known as &quot;Red Queen&quot;. This used a large round in a rotary cannon arrangement for high rates of fire. In spite of some progress, in 1959, the General Staff concluded that guns were no longer useful against modern aircraft. For their immediate needs they purchased the new Bofors 40/L70, and for the longer term began a new missile development for a short-range, rapid-reaction weapon, known as the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) system.

===PT.428===
The initial design contest for the LAA was won by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1960, and given the development name PT.428. This called for a system that could be carried on a single 4-ton Bedford TK truck. The firing unit was a single piece that would normally be placed on the ground during operation, but could be fired from the truck in an emergency. The system was deliberately designed to fit, when taken apart, as a single load in the Fairey Rotodyne. The system was quite advanced, including automated search and track radars, a separate television camera for target identification, and eighteen missiles in two nine-round boxes.

As budget pressures escalated in the early 1960s, the Army was given the choice of picking either PT.428 or their Blue Water nuclear missile. They chose the latter, a decision Solly Zuckerman found rather questionable. The Army officially replaced PT.428 with the similar but slightly less advanced MIM-46 Mauler from the United States. Mauler combined a search radar and nine missiles using either radar or infrared guidance on a single M113-derived vehicle. The concept was similar to PT.428, but larger and with fewer missiles.

===Sightline===
During the development of PT.428, BAC had also considered a lightweight version of the system which mounted six of the PT.428 missiles on a trailer that could be towed by a pickup version of the Land Rover. An early warning radar would be mounted on a framework above the roof of the truck, and initial tracking would be manual using a pair of binoculars mounted on a gimbal system in the truck bed. A small antenna on the launcher trailer would communicate with the missile to bring it into alignment with the binoculars and then follow semi-active radar homing (SARH) from that point.

When PT.428 ended in 1961, BAC began considering less-expensive options based on the same general concept. During this time, Colin Baron and John Twinn at the Royal Aircraft Establishment were developing an optical semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) system. Using this with the PT.428 missile produced the Sightline concept, which would be much less expensive than the original radar-guided version.

The next year, Mauler was downgraded on its way to being cancelled, leaving both the US and British Army with no modern short-range anti-aircraft systems. The General Staff and Air Staff responded by issuing the combined GASR.3132 requirement for a clear-weather daytime SAM for both the Army and the RAF Regiment. Whether GASR.3132 was designed for Sightline, or Sightline for GASR.3132, is not clear in existing references. The new concept was given the name &quot;Defoe&quot;. An even smaller and cheaper system lacking an early warning radar was also considered under GASR.3134.

===Rapier===
In 1963, Defoe was made official, given the development target ET.316. BAC management initially gave it the name &quot;Mongoose&quot;, but during a board meeting the issue arose that no one knew what more than one mongoose was called; mongooses? mongeese? The name &quot;Rapier&quot; was suggested and made official.

As development continued, it became increasingly clear that the Rapier was far more a formidable weapon than initially expected. The optical tracking system was so accurate that the missile almost always hit the target aircraft, so despite its small warhead and lack of a proximity fuze it almost guaranteed a kill. BAC joked that the system was a &quot;hit-ile&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;miss-ile&quot;. It also became clear that the warning radar system would be invaluable in the field, and GASR.3134 was dropped.

The first test firings of the missile took place in 1966. The system was extensively tested at Woomera, considerably supported by the Australian Army, an early user of the Rapier system.

In 1965, some Australian staff at Woomera began to develop a simulator system understand and tune the manual guidance system. This consisted of a joystick from the Rapier optical tracker which caused the projected image of the missile to move about. Models of the missile and various target aircraft were constructed and filmed using stop motion techniques to make a selection of films of various target attack sequences across the Woomera sky. The system was completed in 1968. In initial testing, tracking was seen to be a serious problem, and the British Army was concerned the system would be beyond the capabilities of the average gunner. Some problems were solved by adjusting the joystick&#x27;s mechanical feedback to more closely match the missile&#x27;s difficulty responding to various inputs. Many of the remaining issues were subsequently solved via a massive simulation run and data processing using an IBM 7090. Complete systems were tested in 1968, with a subsequent production contract in 1969.

On a parallel track, the RAF Regiment had been looking for a short-range weapon for airfield defense. Eventually, this led to the development of the Tigercat system in 1967, an adaptation of the Seacat naval surface-to-air missile system. Tigercat was similar to Rapier in basic concept, but based on older technologies and thus somewhat larger and heavier while offering less range and much slower speeds. Tigercat was introduced into service with No 48 Squadron RAF Regiment in 1968, giving the RAF Regiment the UK&#x27;s first effective fully air portable low-level SAM system and valuable experience in operating systems of this type. In 1972 a trials unit known as the Rapier Pilot Battery was formed jointly by No 63 Squadron RAF Regiment and 9 (Plassey) Light Air Defence Battery Royal Artillery. Comprehensive trials ended in 1973 and the first Rapier unit in British service, No. 63 Squadron, deployed to its operational station in Germany in mid-1974.

In the 1980s, a new training simulator system was constructed in Stevenage. This consisted of a radius hemispherical dome whose inside surface was used as a movie screen onto which terrain images were projected. A copper vapor laser projected images of targets and the missiles in-flight on top of the background imagery, while a smaller helium-neon laser simulated the Rapier&#x27;s tracking flare. A complete Rapier targeting unit was placed in the center of the dome, and its guidance signals were captured and sent to the simulator to update the position of the missile. The projected laser imagery was bright enough that it could be tracked by IR imagers and seekers, allowing it to be used with the updated Darkfire versions of the Rapier with their IR cameras, or other IR seeking missiles like the Stinger. This system was sold separately for use with other missile systems under the name British Aerospace Microdome.

==Variants==
The original Rapier took the form of a two-wheeled launcher carrying four missiles, an optical tracker unit, a generator, and a trailer of reserve missiles. The launcher consists of a vertical cylindrical unit carrying two missiles on each side, the surveillance radar dish and &quot;Identification Friend or Foe&quot; (IFF) system under a radome on top, the guidance computer and radar electronics at the bottom, and a prominent parabolic antenna for sending guidance commands to the missiles on the front.

The search radar, of the pulsed Doppler type, has a range of about . The aerial, located at the top of the launcher, rotates about once a second, looking for moving targets through their Doppler shift. Upon detecting a target, a lamp lights up on the Selector Engagement Zone (SEZ) — a box containing 32 orange lamps arranged in a circle about the size of an automobile steering wheel. The radar operator can use switches to blank out returns from other directions, providing jamming resistance.

The optical tracker unit comprises a stationary lower section housing the operator controls and a rotating upper section containing the tracking optics. The operator&#x27;s optical system is a modified telescope containing a Dove prism to prevent the image &#x27;toppling&#x27; as the optics rotate in azimuth. Using this system means that, unlike a periscope, the operator does not have to move to track the target. The upper section also contains a separate missile tracking system that follows the operator&#x27;s optics, based on a television camera optimized for the IR band.

Upon detection of a target, the optical tracking system is slewed to target the azimuth supplied by the SEZ; the operator then searches for the target in elevation. The operator&#x27;s field of view is selected based on the target&#x27;s range: &quot;wide&quot; at about 20 degrees or &quot;track&quot; at about 4.8 degrees. When the target is found, the operator switches to &quot;track&quot; and uses a joystick to keep the target centred in the telescope. Once a steady track is established, the missile is fired. The TV camera on the tracker is tuned to track four flares on the missile&#x27;s tail. Like the operator&#x27;s telescope, the TV system has two views: about 11 degrees wide for the initial &quot;capture&quot;, and 0.55 degrees for mid-course tracking.

The location of the missile relative to the line of sight is measured using a system identical to the &quot;chopper&quot; system used in early infrared homing missiles. The chopper is inside the launcher, rather than on the missile, and feeds an image from the tracking camera which passes through the light from the flares. The chopper generates signals that encode the angle of the missile relative to &quot;up&quot; and the angle out from the centre, or &quot;error off&quot;. The simple computer in the base then calculates the control inputs needed to bring the missile into the line of sight and sends them to the missile via the transmitter on the launcher platform, to the small receiver antennas on the rear of the mid-body fins. The operator simply keeps the telescope&#x27;s crosshairs on the target using the joystick, and the missile automatically flies into the line of sight. The basic concept is similar to that used by most anti-tank missiles, except that those normally use small wires — rather than a radio link — to send guidance information to the missile.

The missile contains a warhead with a contact fuze and a single-stage solid-rocket motor that accelerates the missile to about , about Mach 2. Engagement time to the maximum effective range is about 13 seconds. Response time from initial target detection to missile launch is about six seconds, repeatedly confirmed in live firing.

The whole system and its crew are delivered by two Land Rovers designated the &quot;Fire Unit Truck&quot; (FUT) and the &quot;Detachment Support Vehicle&quot; (DSV). Royal Artillery batteries comprised three troops each of four fire units, while RAF Regiment squadrons had eight fire units. By 1980, each Royal Artillery fire unit consisted of a 24-volt, 101 FC 1 tonne Land Rover towing the Rapier Launcher and carrying four missiles on board, a , 3/4 ton, 24 V FFR (Fitted For Radio) Land Rover towing a 1-ton Missile Supply Trailer (MST) containing up to 10 further missiles. Blindfire radar (see below) was only provided for a third of fire units in British Army service, but for all fire units in the RAF Regiment.

===Blindfire radar, FSA===
Although accurate and simple to use, the original Rapier system clearly suffered from a lack of all-weather capability. To address this need, BAC started work on a separate radar guidance unit, primarily to improve foreign sales. This led to the introduction of the Marconi DN 181 &quot;Blindfire&quot; radar in 1970, the first examples being sold to the Iranian Army in 1973.

The British Army did not purchase the Blindfire system until 1979, entering service with Rapier &quot;Field Standard A&quot; (FSA). The RAF Regiment had 27 Squadron operational with Blindfire at RAF Leuchars by 1979, and was in the process of bringing all the RAF Regiment GBAD (Ground Based Air Defence) Squadrons into line. By 1997 more than 350 Blindfire radars had been produced.

To ensure accuracy, Blindfire uses a very narrow &quot;pencil&quot; beam and tracks both the target and missile. To allow the operator to monitor the Blindfire system when it tracks the target, the existing optical tracker follows the Blindfire radar, although it is possible for the optical tracker to be manually &quot;laid on&quot; a second target whilst the Blindfire engages the first. The Blindfire trailer carries its own generator unit, and is towed by a third Land Rover (a 12 V winch-equipped 101 FC) with the designation &quot;Tracking Radar Tractor&quot; (TRT).

===Tracked Rapier===
With sales to Iran came the additional requirement for a fully-mobile version of Rapier to protect the Chieftain tanks being supplied on a UK MOD contract. BAC responded by adapting the Rapier system to fit on the M548, a cargo-carrier version of the ubiquitous M113. Development started in 1974 as &quot;Tracked Rapier&quot;, with the first public showing at the 1977 Paris Air Show as a static display unit.

The initial proposal for the system was to simply mount the towed launcher, including its petrol generator set but minus its running gear, on the flatbed of the M548 carrier. When this was shown to Mr. G.R. Jefferson, the GW Managing Director, he was not very impressed. Aware of the amount of money available, he required a much more extensive change. Greville Beale and Adrian Pollicutt led the development of a significantly different arrangement which was produced in a short period.
This included significant changes to armour the M548 vehicle, now designated RCM 748, and to incorporate the diesel-powered Coventry Climax H 30 engine to run the new generator set, and also as the auxiliary power unit. The majority of the electronic equipment in the launcher was not changed significantly from the towed version. However, a completely redesigned armoured launcher with the capability of loading eight missiles was produced, mounted via anti-vibration mounts to the flatbed of the vehicle. The armoured cab was provided with pan-climatic heating/cooling and NBC protection.

The optical tracker was placed inside the armoured cab of the vehicle, elevating through the roof for operation. The tracker was operated from the right side of the crew cabin, while on the left were the driver and tactical controller who also had a helmet-mounted sight, allowing him to lay the tracker onto a visual target.
From moving to firing took only 30 seconds, a tremendous improvement over Towed Rapier, which required at least 15 minutes to unlimber, cable-up and align. A further difference between Towed and Tracked Rapier was that the Tracked Rapier launcher had eight (protected) missile rails compared with four in the towed system, enhancing firepower and reducing re-supply requirements. It was also air-portable, ready to deploy on landing, in C-130 aircraft.
There was no room for Blindfire on a single RCM748 vehicle, so this was instead towed or was to be carried on a separate modified M548/RCM748. Feeding data to the control system in the firing unit again required setup time to connect the two pieces of equipment.

The system had not yet been fully developed when the Iranian Shah fell from power in 1978. The vehicles were later purchased by the British Army as part of a Fixed-price Develop and Supply contract. The first production Tracked Rapier was accepted on time and to cost at Wellington Barracks in early 1981, and entered service with &quot;11 (Sphinx) Air Defence Battery&quot;, of 22 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1983 in Napier Barracks near Dortmund.

After initially entering service at Towed FSB1 standard, with planar array radar and the &#x27;Pointing Stick&#x27;, the Tracked Rapiers were upgraded, with the latest version included a thermal-imaging enhanced tracker which enabled single vehicle 24-hour operation without the need for the Blindfire unit.
A modified M548 Missile Resupply Vehicle carried replacement missiles, a relief crew, and additional field kits, rations and water. A further M548 was configured as a REME Forward Area Support team with test facilities and spares.

During the Gulf War, 12 and 16 Regiment Royal Artillery tracked batteries, quickly fitted with sat-nav for desert use, combined to provide Tracked Rapier support to deployed armoured regiments.
Tracked Rapier was retired in the early 1990s, due to manning limitations when the Towed FSC version entered service. It has since been replaced by Starstreak missile launchers mounted on the Alvis Stormer.

===FSB===
Shortly after introducing FSA, &quot;Field Standard B&quot; (FSB) added a number of basic upgrades. Additionally, the search radar was upgraded to be easily shut down in case of an anti-radiation missile attack. FSB included lessons from the Falklands campaign, notable the &#x27;pointing stick&#x27; that enabled the detachment commander of a fire unit to point the aiming unit at a target.

===Laserfire===
With the range of upgrades and new components, the original low-cost Rapier system was gone. In order to address international market requirements for a lower-cost system, BAC started development of the &quot;Rapier Laserfire&quot; in 1982. Laserfire replaced the original optical tracker unit with a new lidar (laser radar) illuminating system that is considerably smaller, allowing the entire system to be mounted on a single pallet that could itself be mounted on a truck or other flatbed vehicle.

Laserfire used a millimetric Doppler radar. Due to its very high frequency of operation and ability to transform its beamshape from narrow azimuth and high elevation to wide azimuth and narrow elevation, Laserfire was able to detect helicopters hovering or travelling at low altitude and in areas of high clutter by detecting the movement of the helicopter&#x27;s rotor blades.

Initial engagement is similar to the original Rapier, but the target was illuminated and automatically tracked by a high power YAG:Nd laser. After the missile was launched the laser alternately illuminated the target and missile to determine their locations, and guidance was sent to the missile as normal (see laser guidance). Laserfire thus represented a fairly major upgrade to the original optical system, allowing semi-automatic engagements, and greatly reducing operator skill and training requirements.

On the downside, Laserfire no longer has the optical system of the original, which served an important second duty by allowing the aircraft to be visually identified at long range. Additionally, while the Laserfire tracking system was capable of being operated at night, target acquisition was optical, like the original Rapier.

===Darkfire===
In 1985 development started on a new tracker that replaced the original optical system with a new IR thermal imager system to improve its abilities, especially at night. This version was known as &quot;Rapier Darkfire&quot; for this reason. Trials of the new system started in 1987, and were deployed operationally in 1990 as &quot;Field Standard B2&quot; (FSB2), the earlier upgrades retroactively becoming FSB1. This system was also known as &quot;Rapier 90&quot;. Cooling for the imager was provided by bottles of compressed gas.

FSB2 also introduced a number of improvements that greatly improved Rapier capabilities. First and foremost was the Tactical Control Console that allowed four Rapier launchers to be controlled from a central location. The launchers themselves were upgraded to carry six missiles instead of four, improving battery capacity. Finally, the search radar was updated to use a new planar array radar, although its capabilities remained generally the same as the earlier model.

===Missile upgrades===
In 1988 tests started on an improved warhead using a proximity fuze, in order to give Rapier capability against smaller targets that would be difficult to hit directly, notably high-speed remotely piloted vehicles. Serial production of Mk. 1E began in 1989.

In 1992 the Army signed a contract to upgrade all Rapier systems to an enhanced version. A Mark 2 missile variant commenced development in 1986 culminating in a complete re-design which entered service in the mid-1990s. Along with a further upgrade of the proximity fuze, the new missile incorporated (then) state-of-art technologies including:

Von Karman supersonic aerodynamic profile; composite propellant, with a two-stage shaped burn and laminated body solid rocket motor; ceramic substrate surface mount PCBs; completely new electronic systems and software; both analogue and digital proprietary ASICs; highly ECM resistant front end and command link with redundant encoding; fully Digital Autopilot incorporating Kalman state filtering; inertial navigation comprising ring-laser roll and rate gyroscope; Kapton ribbon cabling.

The missile warhead is available in two versions, the Mk. 2A for the normal anti-aircraft role, and the Mk. 2B, which includes a shaped charge warhead and dual fuzes, and which is useful against light armour as well.

===Rapier 2000===
In 1992, shortly after the introduction of Rapier 90, another major upgrade series started at MBDA (previously Matra BAe Dynamics). Emerging as &quot;Rapier 2000&quot;, or &quot;Field Standard C&quot; (FSC) in British service, the system reached its ultimate form. Development of the FSC system began in 1983 and the systems first entered service in 1996. By this time the Cold War was over and British air defence capabilities were significantly reduced, with fewer and smaller batteries, albeit every fire unit with Blindfire. There is also an export version of this version, known as &quot;Jernas&quot;. Malaysia is the first export customer for Jernas.

FSC was effectively a new system, although Blindfire was little changed and it could fire both Mk 1 and Mk 2 missiles. The Surveillance radar was removed from the launcher and became a separate element and each launcher now carried eight missiles.

With the missiles increasingly relying on radar guidance since the introduction of Blindfire, it made sense to upgrade the original search radar to something much more modern. This was supplied by the Alenia Marconi &quot;Dagger&quot;, a 3D pulse doppler radar with an integrated Cossor IFF Mark 10 system. Dagger is mounted on its own trailer, so the radome on top of the launcher unit was no longer needed. In its place, a much more modern optical tracking system was added. The new tracker used a Stirling-cycle cooler instead of compressed gas bottles. The use of much smaller electronics greatly reduced stack height of the whole launcher, allowing an additional two missiles to be added, for a total of eight.

In operation, the Rapier 2000 is similar to earlier Blindfire-equipped systems. Targets are acquired visually or through the Dagger radar, and then the Blindfire and optical tracker are slewed onto the target. The optical system can be used solely to track the missile, or it can be used for all guidance, like the original Rapier. In either case the engagement is entirely automatic, with no operator guidance needed. The optical system can also be used as a search system, seeking out IR sources, allowing radar-quiet operation.

In 2006 a Ministry of Defence study in Ground Based Air Defence recommended further reductions, based on a reduced air threat and the improved air defence capabilities afforded by the Typhoon fighter. These included removing the role from the RAF Regiment as a measure to preserve Royal Artillery units in the face of significant cuts to the Army. Nevertheless, the Royal Artillery units were placed under command of the HQ 1 Group RAF (within HQ Air Command) and the Joint Ground Based Air Defence Headquarters was formed.

==Combat history==

The first known use of a Rapier in combat was in December 1974 during the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War when it shot down an Ilyushin Il-76MD belonging to the Iraqi Air Force. The missile belonged to the Iranian army, but it was stationed inside Iraq to protect the Kurdish military headquarters. It was fired by a British crew, which seems to have been under contract to either the Iranian government or possibly the missile&#x27;s manufacturer, BAC.
A number of years after the Shah was deposed in 1978, during informal contact with senior members of the Iranian army they indicated to a UK support organisation that they had continued to operate the initial batch of 30 launchers that had been delivered prior to the Shah&#x27;s removal and that they had intercepted and destroyed a number of invading aircraft, significantly more than were engaged in the Falkland activities.

In April 1982, the original Rapier was deployed during the Falklands War when T Battery of the 12th Regiment Royal Artillery joined 3 Commando Brigade as part of the Falklands Task Force, landing at San Carlos on 21 May. Their task was to provide air defence cover for a Harrier landing and re-fuelling pad built on the outskirts of Port San Carlos. (T Battery&#x27;s sister battery, 9 (Plassey) Battery, was not deployed on the islands until after the conflict had ended.) 63 Squadron RAF Regiment, coincidentally the first unit to have been equipped with Rapier, was deployed at San Carlos bay on 1 June, later deploying around Stanley.

There were many sighting problems which prevented Rapier from operating efficiently, which led to it not being particularly effective in terms of number of &#x27;kills&#x27;; but its presence acted as a deterrent, especially after the deployment of Blindfire systems around Port San Carlos.

From an engineering perspective, the fragile nature of the launchers was well known before the conflict, exacerbated by the sinking of the with almost all of the missiles spares. The intermittent unserviceability of fire unit 32 alpha at Fitzroy was one of many factors that contributed to the success of the bombing of the .

Early post-war reports were favourable, indicating 14 kills and 6 probables. Later analysis was less rosy, indicating as few as four enemy aircraft were downed. Only one Argentine aircraft, a Dagger A of FAA Grupo 6, can be confirmed as a Rapier kill, when Lt Bernhardt&#x27;s aircraft was destroyed on 29 May 1982. The pilot was killed. The other three, an A-4B Skyhawk of FAA Grupo 5 on 23 May and two A-4C Skyhawk of FAA Grupo 4 on 24 May and 25 May 1982, were subjected to the full force of the San Carlos Air Defences, with claims going to Sea Wolf, Sea Cat, Blowpipe and small arms, as well as T Battery.

The official history of the war states &quot;Within the total, only five Argentine aircraft might have been shot down by Rapier, and, as originally noted by Ethell and Price, only one of these was certain, with two probables and two possibles. Similar discrepancies arose over other weapons systems, notably Blowpipe (one confirmed against nine claimed and two probables) and Sea Cat (zero to one against eight claimed and two probables). This confirmation that MoD had exaggerated, however unwittingly, the capabilities of Rapier was deemed to be political, as it was observed that if this assessment became widely known it &#x27;could have serious adverse effects on sales&#x27; prospects for Rapier, which was a staple revenue-earner for BAe&#x27;s Dynamic Group.&quot;

The main problems were a lack of range, and the decision to omit a proximity fuze, an attribute which required the operator to strike the target aircraft directly with the missile. Rapier also suffered from problems with the IFF system and suffered from interference with Royal Navy radar.

Rapiers were used during the 2012 Summer Olympics to provide air-defence security for the games. Rapier systems were placed at four sites: (Blackheath Common; William Girling Reservoir in Enfield; Oxleas Meadow, Shooter&#x27;s Hill; and Barn Hill in Epping Forest), with Starstreak missiles at two other sites.

==Replacement==
At the DSEI conference in September 2007 it was announced the UK MoD was funding a study by MBDA UK to investigate a replacement for Rapier which was scheduled to leave service about 2020. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM), would share components with the ASRAAM missile in service with the RAF. In July 2021 it was reported that Sky Sabre had started acceptance trials and training with the 7th Air Defence Group of the Royal Artillery. It was planned to deploy the system in the Falkland Islands in &quot;late summer/early autumn&quot;.

<text>Aillen or Áillen is an incendiary being in Irish mythology. He played the harp or timpán and would lull his victims into a deep sleep with his music.

==Character==
Called &quot;the burner&quot;, According to the most frequently repeated story, Aillén harasses Cormac&#x27;s court at Tara every November 1 at Samhain.

==Deeds==
According to &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;, he would burn Tara to the ground every year at Samhain with his fiery breath after lulling all the inhabitants to sleep with his music. This only ended with the arrival of Fionn mac Cumhaill, who inhaled the poison from his spear to keep himself awake and slew Aillen. The act won him the leadership of the Fianna.

==Names==
Áillen was also a popular personal name in ancient Ireland and was used by several personages.

<text>In Irish mythology and genealogy, Aimend is the daughter of Óengus Bolg, king of the Dáirine or Corcu Loígde. She marries Conall Corc, founder of the Eóganachta dynasties, and through him is an ancestor of the &quot;inner circle&quot; septs of Eóganacht Chaisil, Eóganacht Glendamnach, and Eóganacht Áine, who established the powerful kingship of Cashel. Details of the story imply she may have originally been a goddess (Byrne 2001: 166, 193).

==Etymology==
This name appears to be derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;aidu-mandā&quot;. The name literally means &quot;burning stain,&quot; which may have been a byword for the notion of ‘sunburn’ (q.v. ). 
The Romano-British form of this Proto-Celtic name is likely to have been *&quot;Aedumanda&quot; (q.v. ).

<doc id="85920" wikidata="Q249961" url="?curid=85920" title="Áine">
<text>Áine () is an Irish goddess of summer, wealth, and sovereignty. She is associated with midsummer and the sun, and is sometimes represented by a red mare. She is the daughter of Egobail, the sister of Aillen and/or Fennen, and is claimed as an ancestor by multiple Irish families. As the goddess associated with fertility, she has command over crops and animals and is also associated with agriculture.

Áine is associated with County Limerick, where the hill of Knockainey () is named after her. This hill was the site of rites in her honour, involving fire and the blessing of the land, recorded as recently as 1879. She is also associated with sites such as Toberanna (), County Tyrone; Dunany (), County Louth; Lissan (), County Londonderry; and &quot;Cnoc Áine&quot; near Teelin, County Donegal.

==In Irish mythology==
===Ailill Aulom===
The descendants of Aulom, the Eóganachta, claim Áine as an ancestor.

===Gearóid FitzGerald===

In other tales Áine is the wife of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, known popularly as &quot;Iarl Gearóid&quot;. Rather than having a consensual marriage, he rapes her (thought to be based on the story of Ailill Aulom), and she exacts her revenge by either changing him into a goose, killing him or both. The FitzGeralds thus claim an association with Áine; despite the Norman origins of the clan, the FitzGeralds would become known for being &quot;More Irish than the Irish themselves.&quot;

In a variant of the FitzGerald story, Áine is raped by Gerald&#x27;s father the Earl of Desmond, who witnesses Áine combing her hair while bathing in a river. The Earl takes possession of Áine&#x27;s cloak, which is the only way to control her, and he rapes her. Gerald FitzGerald is the product of their union, and Gerald exhibits certain magical abilities; he has the ability to dramatically change size (shrinks down to jump into a bottle), and he can transform into a goose, which he does at Lough Gur near Cnoc Áine. After Gerald&#x27;s father dies, Áine and Gerald inherit his lands. Áine enchants the hillside of Cnoc Áine, causing peas to grow there miraculously overnight. In some versions of the story, Gerald is the king of the Sídhfir, is bound to a pillar in Loch Guirr, and according to Munster prophecy, will one day rise from the Loch mounted on a black steed with a white face to engage in combat during the final war.

===Manannán mac Lir===
In yet other versions of her myth, she is the wife or daughter of the sea god, Manannán mac Lir.

== Oral folklore ==
In folklore from County Limerick, Áine is said to have two daughters whom she admonished never to marry. The first daughter disobeys her, and on her wedding night Áine finds her son-in-law eating the breast off her daughter. Áine forces her younger daughter to witness the horror and reinforces her warning about disobeying her mother, but the younger daughter soon elopes and runs off with a druid. Áine then shuts herself into her house as a recluse and will only commune with the Sidhe. She dies of grief on Saint John&#x27;s Eve, and the good folk assemble in great masses bearing torches. It is said from this time on &quot;cliars&quot; were carried in the fields on Saint John&#x27;s eve.

In other folklore from County Limerick, Áine was said to have lived in a fort in Cnoc Áine long ago. A woman gathered ash sticks from the fort, and Áine told her to put them back exactly as they were; when the woman failed to do so, Áine abducted her, carrying her into the fort. Áine is described as having long, flowing hair.

In another folktale, Áine was said to live at the bottom of a lake. Each year she would emerge at midsummer to sit in her favorite spot called &quot;Suidheachán Bean-a&#x27;-tighe&quot;, where she would comb her long golden hair with a golden comb. A young shepherd watched her from afar, and after she fell asleep he stole her comb. Every misfortune visited him after that, but before he died, he requested that the comb be thrown back into the lake.

People in Limerick once brought their sick to the lakes on the 6th night of the full moon (called &quot;All-Heal&quot;) when the moon shone brightly on the waters. They believed that if the sick were not healed by the 8th or 9th night that Áine would sing or play the &quot;Ceol Sidhe&quot;, which was used to comfort the dying. Áine&#x27;s red-haired dwarf brother Fer Fí, a harper, would then sing the &quot;Suantraige&quot;, which was the song that lulled the dead to sleep.

In The Legend of Seán Ó hAodh, the herdsman piper Seán Ó hAodh meets Áine, clothed in fine white robes, near Lough Gur in August, and she requests Seán to play at a ball. She meets Seán in a splendid horse-drawn carriage, and they travel over a long road laden with roses and fruit trees. When they arrive at Áine&#x27;s mansion, Seán plays the pipes before fine ladies and gentlemen until the early morning hours, but when the sun rises, he sees fish shoaling outside the windows and realizes he is at the bottom of Lough Gur. At the end of the evening, the ladies and gentlemen give Seán guineas and Áine gives Seán a gold purse, and he falls asleep. He reawakens on &quot;Suidheachán Bean-a&#x27;-tighe&quot; to find that all the guineas have turned to gorse but that the gold purse that Áine gave him is still there and never runs empty.

==Festivals==
The feast of Midsummer Night was held in her honor. In County Limerick, she is remembered in more recent times as Queen of the Fae. On Saint John&#x27;s Eve men used to gather on Cnoc Áine, where she was said to dwell, where they would light &quot;clíars&quot; - bunches of straw and hay tied on poles - that were carried in procession to the top of the hill. Later, the men ran with the &quot;clíars&quot; through their fields and between cattle to bring good luck for the rest of the year. Men who came from neighboring villages were said to be required to look to the moon as they approached the hill to avoid forgetting their homes.

Áine is spoken of as &quot;the best hearted woman that ever lived&quot; and the meadowsweet or queen-of-the-meadow is said to be her plant.

==Related goddesses==
Áine (Ir. &quot;brightness, glow, joy, radiance; splendour, glory, fame&quot;) is sometimes mistakenly equated with Danu as her name bears a superficial resemblance to Anu.

&quot;Aynia&quot;, reputedly the most powerful fairy in Ulster, may be a variant of the same figure. Áine&#x27;s hill is located in the heart of &quot;Cnoc Áine&quot; (Knockainy) in County Limerick, is the hill of the goddess Grian, &quot;Cnoc Gréine&quot;. Grian (literally, &quot;sun&quot;) is believed to be either the sister of Áine, another of Áine&#x27;s manifestations, or possibly &quot;Macha in disguise&quot;. Due to Áine&#x27;s connection with midsummer rites, it is possible that Áine and Grian may share a dual-goddess, seasonal function (such as seen in the Gaelic myths of the Cailleach and Brigid) with the two sisters representing the &quot;two suns&quot; of the year: Áine representing the light half of the year and the bright summer sun (&quot;an ghrian mhór&quot;), and Grian the dark half of the year and the pale winter sun (&quot;an ghrian bheag&quot;).

<doc id="85924" wikidata="Q1118976" url="?curid=85924" title="Rosmerta">
<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Rosmerta was a goddess of fertility and abundance, her attributes being those of plenty such as the cornucopia. Rosmerta is attested by statues and by inscriptions. In Gaul she was often depicted with the Roman god Mercury as her consort, but is sometimes found independently.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Rosmerta&quot; is Gaulish, and is analysed as &quot;ro-smert-a&quot;. &quot;Smert&quot; means &quot;provider&quot; or &quot;carer&quot; and is also found in other Gaulish names such as Ad-smerio, Smertu-litani, Smerius (Σμερο), Smertae, Smertus, and others. &quot;Ro-&quot; is a modifier meaning &quot;very&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, or &quot;most&quot; as found in Ro-bili (&quot;most-good&quot;) or Ro-cabalus (&quot;great horse&quot;). The &quot;-a&quot; ending is the typical Gaulish feminine singular nominative. The meaning is thus &quot;the Great Provider&quot;.

==Iconography==
A relief from Autun (ancient &quot;Augustodunum&quot;, the &quot;civitas&quot; capital of the Celtic Aedui), shows Rosmerta and Mercury seated together as a divine couple. She holds a cornucopia, with Mercury holding a patera at her left side.
A bas-relief from Eisenberg shows the couple in the same relative positions, with Rosmerta securely identified by the inscription. Rosmerta holds a purse in her right hand and a patera in her left.

In a pair of statues from Paris depicting the couple, Rosmerta holds a cornucopia and a basket of fruits.

Rosmerta is shown by herself on a bronze statue from Fins d&#x27;Annency (Haute-Savoie), where she sits on a rock holding a purse and, unusually, also bears the wings of Mercury on her head. A stone bas-relief from Escolives-Sainte-Camille shows her holding both a patera and a cornucopia.

==Inscriptions==
Twenty-seven inscriptions to Rosmerta are listed by Jufer and Luginbühl, distributed in France, Germany and Luxembourg, corresponding mainly to the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Superior. An additional two inscriptions are known, one from Roman Dacia.

An inscription from Metz is a dedication &quot;(votum)&quot; to Mercury and Rosmerta jointly. Another from Eisenberg was made by a decurion in fulfillment of a vow to the couple jointly.

In two inscriptions both from Gallia Belgica, Rosmerta is given the epithet &quot;sacra&quot;, sacred. A lengthier inscription from Wasserbillig in Gallia Belgica associates the divine couple with the dedication of a shrine &quot;(aedes)&quot;, with &quot;hospitable&quot; rites to be celebrated.

<doc id="85926" wikidata="Q7120741" url="?curid=85926" title="PSOS (real-time operating system)">
<text>pSOS (Portable Software On Silicon) is a real-time operating system (RTOS), created in about 1982 by Alfred Chao, and developed and marketed for the first part of its life by his company Software Components Group (SCG). In the 1980s, pSOS rapidly became the RTOS of choice for all embedded systems based on the Motorola 68000 series family architecture, because it was written in 68000 assembly language and was highly optimised from the start. It was also modularised, with early support for OS-aware debugging, plug-in device drivers, Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) stacks, language libraries, and disk subsystems. Later came source code level debugging, multiprocessing support, and further computer networking extensions.

In about 1991, Software Components Group was acquired by Integrated Systems Inc. (ISI) which further developed pSOS, then renamed as pSOS+, for other microprocessor families, by rewriting most of it in the programming language C. Attention was also paid to supporting successively more integrated development environments, culminating in pRISM+.

In July 1994, ISI acquired Digital Research&#x27;s modular real-time multi-tasking operating system FlexOS from Novell.

In 1995, ISI offered a codice_1 package for Novell Embedded Systems Technology (NEST).

In February 2000, ISI was acquired by Wind River Systems, the originators of the rival RTOS VxWorks. Despite initial reports that pSOS support would continue, development was halted. Wind River announced plans for a &#x27;convergence&#x27; version of VxWorks which will support pSOS system calls, and that no further releases of pSOS will occur.

NXP Semiconductors acquired pSOS for TriMedia from Wind River and continued to support this OS for the TriMedia very long instruction word (VLIW) core.

==Migration away from pSOS==
In March 2000, rival company Express Logic released their Evaluation Kit for pSOS+ users, designed to provide a migration path to its ThreadX RTOS.

During August 2000, MapuSoft Technologies Inc. came up with the pSOS OS Changer porting kit which can smoothly move the software to multiple OS such as Linux, VxWorks, and more. It includes an &quot;integrated development environment&quot; (IDE) and &quot;application programming interface&quot; (API) optimization along with a profiling tool to measure API timing on target boards (www.mapusoft.com). 

In August 2007, RoweBots, a former partner of SCG and ISI, open sourced their pSOS+ compatible version called Reliant. It is available to all that wish to upgrade without application changes.

The Xenomai project supports pSOS+ APIs (and others traditional RTOS APIs) over a Linux-based real-time framework to allow existing industrial applications to migrate easily to a Linux-based environment while keeping stringent real-time guarantees.

Another open sourced alternative is RTEMS, which has support for various APIs, including the &quot;Classic API&quot; (compatible to pSOS) and the POSIX API. Compared to Linux, RTEMS is a closer match to pSOS applications due to its lower memory size and its strict realtime behaviour.

Popular &quot;Secure Sockets Layer&quot; (SSL), now &quot;Transport Layer Security&quot; (TLS), libraries such as wolfSSL still support pSOS.

<doc id="85928" wikidata="Q1075322" url="?curid=85928" title="Nuada Airgetlám">
<text>In Irish mythology, Nuada or Nuadu (modern spelling: Nuadha), known by the epithet Airgetlám (Airgeadlámh, meaning &quot;silver hand/arm&quot;), was the first king of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He is also called Nechtan, Nuadu Necht and Elcmar, and is the husband of Boann. He is mostly known from the tale in which he loses his arm or hand in battle, and thus his kingship, but regains it after being magically healed by Dian Cécht. Nuada is thought to have been a god and is related to the British and Gaulish god Nodens, who is associated with hunting and fishing. His Welsh equivalent is Nudd or Lludd Llaw Eraint.

==Etymology==
Middle Irish &quot;Núada/Núadu&quot; means &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;champion&quot;, which is &quot;probably a euhemerized name for the deity.&quot; The name Nuada may derive from a Celtic stem *&quot;noudont-&quot; or &quot;*noudent-&quot;, which J. R. R. Tolkien suggested was related to a Germanic root meaning &quot;acquire, have the use of&quot;, earlier &quot;to catch, entrap (as a hunter)&quot;. Making the connection with Nuada and Lludd&#x27;s hand, he detected &quot;an echo of the ancient fame of the magic hand of Nodens the Catcher&quot;. Similarly, Julius Pokorny derives the name from a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*neu-d-&quot; meaning &quot;acquire, utilise, go fishing&quot;. Matasovic says that the formation from Proto-Celtic &quot;*nawito-&quot; meaning &quot;need, compel&quot; is quite difficult.

==Description==
Nuada was king of the Tuatha Dé Danann for seven years before they came to Ireland. They made contact with the Fir Bolg, the then-inhabitants of the island, and Nuada sought from them half of the island for the Tuatha Dé, which their king rejected. Both peoples made ready for war, and in an act of chivalry allowed their numbers and arms to be inspected by the opposing side to allow for a truly fair battle. During this first great battle at Mag Tuired, Nuada lost an arm in combat with the Fir Bolg champion Sreng. Nuada&#x27;s ally, Aengaba of Norway, then fought Sreng, sustaining a mortal wound, while the Dagda protected Nuada. Fifty of the Dagda&#x27;s soldiers carried Nuada from the field. The Tuatha Dé gained the upper hand in the battle, but Sreng later returned to challenge Nuada to single combat. Nuada accepted, on the condition that Sreng fought with one arm tied up. Sreng refused, but by this point the battle was won and the Fir Bolg all but vanquished. The Tuatha Dé then decided to offer Sreng one quarter of Ireland for his people instead of the one half offered before the battle, and he chose Connacht.

Having lost his arm, Nuada was no longer eligible for kingship because of the Tuatha Dé tradition that their king must be physically perfect, and he was replaced as king by Bres, a half-Fomorian prince renowned for his beauty and intellect. The Fomorians were mythological enemies of the people of Ireland, often equated with the mythological &quot;opposing force&quot; such as the Greek Titans to the Olympians, and during Bres&#x27;s reign they imposed great tribute on the Tuatha Dé, who became disgruntled with their new king&#x27;s oppressive rule and lack of hospitality. By this time Nuada had his lost arm replaced by a working silver one by the physician Dian Cecht and the wright Creidhne (and later with a new arm of flesh and blood by Dian Cecht&#x27;s son Miach). Bres was removed from the kingship, having ruled for seven years, and Nuada was restored. He ruled for twenty more years.

Bres, aided by the Fomorian Balor of the Evil Eye, attempted to retake the kingship by force, and war and continued oppression followed. When the youthful and vigorous Lugh joined Nuada&#x27;s court, the king realised the multi-talented youth could lead the Tuatha Dé against the Fomorians, and stood down in his favour. The second Battle of Mag Tuired followed. Nuada was killed and beheaded in battle by Balor, but Lugh avenged him by killing Balor and led the Tuatha Dé to victory.

Nuada&#x27;s great sword was one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann, brought from one of their four great cities. In &quot;The Fate of the Children of Tuireann&quot; Nuada is described as having a one-eyed door-keeper, whose eye is replaced by the brother healers Miach and Oirmiach with that of a cat.

==Relationships==
Nuada may be the same figure as Nechtan and Elcmar, who are described as the husbands of Boann. His father is named in the genealogies as Echtach son of Etarlam. In the medieval texts, Nuada is described as having two brothers, Dian Cécht and Goibniu. Ethadon is named as one of Nuada&#x27;s sons and Gaible his grandson. Gaible stole a bundle of sticks from the Dagda&#x27;s daughter (named as Ainge), and where he hurled them, a fair wood grew. In &quot;The Book of Invasions&quot;, Nuada is given a son named Caicher and a grandson Uillend.

==Legacy==
Characters who share the name Nuada include the later High Kings Nuadu Finn Fáil and Nuadu Necht, and Nuada, the maternal grandfather of Fionn mac Cumhaill. A rival to Conn of the Hundred Battles was Mug Nuadat (&quot;Nuada&#x27;s Slave&quot;). The Delbhna, a people of early Ireland, had a branch called the Delbhna Nuadat who lived in County Roscommon. The present day town of Maynooth in County Kildare is named after Nuada (its Irish name is Maigh Nuad, meaning The plain of Nuada). 
The Pre-Patrician section of the &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot; have an incomplete entry on Nuada. There, in an entry on the division of Ireland between the sons of Érimón it says, &quot;Every family [...] subsequently in Ireland is of the race of Nuada on account of his maintenance by his kinsmen and on account of his patience.&quot;

==Mythological parallels==
Nuada&#x27;s name is cognate with that of Nodens, a British deity associated with the sea and healing who was equated with the Roman Mars, and with Nudd, a Welsh mythological figure. It is likely that another Welsh figure, Lludd Llaw Eraint (Lludd of the Silver Hand), derives from &quot;Nudd Llaw Eraint&quot; by alliterative assimilation. The Norse god Týr is another deity equated with Mars who lost a hand. Sabazios is another Indo-European deity associated with a sacred hand.

<text>Elmer Figueroa Arce, better known under the stage name Chayanne, (born June 28, 1968) is a Puerto Rican Latin pop singer and actor. As a solo artist, Chayanne has released 21 albums and sold over 15 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists.

Chayanne participated in two Puerto Rican telenovelas broadcast by WAPA-TV television station in the 80s. These were &quot;Sombras del Pasado&quot; with Daniel Lugo and Alba Nydia Díaz, and &quot;Tormento&quot; with Daniel Lugo and Yazmin Pereira.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Arce&#x27;s nickname &quot;Chayanne&quot; was given to him by his mother, in honor of his love for the 1950s American television series, &quot;Cheyenne&quot;.

===Career with Los Chicos===

In the late 1970s, he auditioned for Menudo, but the producers told him that he was too young to be in the group. He joined another group, Los Chicos, and they produced several hit recordings, including &quot;Puerto Rico Son Los Chicos&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. Los Chicos toured all over Latin America and became a major rival to Menudo when Chayanne was a member.

===Solo artist===

After Los Chicos separated in 1984, Chayanne began his career as a solo artist. He signed with RCA Víctor and released his debut album, &quot;Chayanne es mi Nombre&quot;, that year. His second album with RCA Víctor, &quot;Sangre Latina&quot;, was released in 1986.

After three years with RCA Víctor, Chayanne switched labels to Sony Music and broke out with his first self-titled album in 1987. This album featured a blend of ballads and dance tracks, a combination for which Chayanne would become famous. The album featured two hit songs, the ballad &quot;Peligro de Amor&quot;, written by Michael Sullivan and Paulo Massadas, and a song that would cement him as an overall performer, the upbeat dance track &quot;Fiesta en América&quot;, written by Honorio Herrero.

On November 1, 1988, Chayanne released his second self-titled album, &quot;Chayanne&quot;. This album featured several hit singles, including Herrero&#x27;s &quot;Tu Pirata Soy Yo&quot;, José María Cano&#x27;s &quot;Fuiste un Trozo de Hielo en la Escarcha&quot; (&#x27;you were a piece of ice in the frost&#x27;), and &quot;Este Ritmo Se Baila Así&quot;, composed by Pierre-Edouard Decimus and Jacob Desvarieux, both members of Guadeloupean band Kassav&#x27;, and Roberto Livi. At the same time, Chayanne became a spokesperson for Pepsi, with the airing of the first Spanish-speaking advertising spot broadcast on national television, coast to coast, during the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast.

On August 7, 1990, he released the album &quot;Tiempo de Vals&quot;, featuring some of his best-selling singles, such as the title track (composed by José María Cano), &quot;Completamente Enamorados&quot; (by Piero Cassano, Adelio Cogliati, and Eros Ramazzotti), and , composed by Luis Gómez Escolar and Julio Seijas. Chayanne followed this with an album and title track that would eventually become his signature song, &quot;Provócame&quot; (1992). The album also featured the hit &quot;El Centro de mi Corazón&quot; (#1 U.S. Hot Latin, 1992), which was nominated for Pop Song of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993, while Chayanne was nominated for Best Male Pop Artist. Two years later, he released the covers album &quot;Influencias&quot; (1994), which was a tribute to some of his musical influences. In 1996, he released &quot;Volver a Nacer&quot;.

In 1998, he received his second Grammy nomination with the album &quot;Atado a Tu Amor&quot;, which featured his first number-one hit since 1992, &quot;Dejaría Todo&quot;, as well as a long-lasting hit in the title track. The hot streak continued in 2000, when Chayanne released &quot;Simplemente&quot; and the top-ten hit &quot;Candela&quot; and the number-one hit &quot;Yo Te Amo&quot;. On March 19, 2002, he released &quot;Grandes Éxitos&quot;, a greatest-hits album with a few new tracks. One of those new tracks, &quot;Y Tú Te Vas&quot;, was the number-one song of the summer for 2002, and went on to be the theme song for Venezuelan telenovela &quot;Todo sobre Camila&quot;, produced by Venevisión. The following year, Chayanne released &quot;Sincero&quot;, which featured two number-one songs, &quot;Un Siglo Sin Ti&quot; and &quot;Cuidarte el Alma&quot;.

In 2005, Chayanne embarked on a tour alongside Alejandro Fernández and Marc Anthony. That same year, he released two albums, a second compilation album, &quot;Desde Siempre&quot;, with the new song &quot;Contra Vientos y Mareas&quot;, followed by &quot;Cautivo&quot;, with hits such as &quot;No Sé Por Qué&quot;, &quot;Te Echo de Menos&quot; and &quot;No Te Preocupes Por Mí&quot;.

Chayanne&#x27;s 13th album, &quot;Mi Tiempo&quot;, was released on April 10, 2007. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Albums chart, selling 17,000 copies in its first week. The lead single off the album, &quot;Si Nos Quedará Poco Tiempo&quot;, reached number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Chayanne began an international tour to promote &quot;Mi Tiempo&quot;. Among the regions visited on the tour were México, Venezuela, Ecuador, Perú and the United States.

On August 24, 2008, he began a series of presentations in Spain. When interviewed, he noted that the concert would be fluid, &quot;like a musical&quot;, and &quot;more Latin&quot; than his previous presentations, being composed of &quot;more pop, Brazilian, Caribbean and reggae rhythms&quot;, which he would use to &quot;dance constantly&quot;.

He gave a special performance at the Miss Universe 2003 pageant. On October 12, 2009, Chayanne released a new single titled &quot;Me Enamoré de Ti&quot;, serving as the theme song for the 2009 soap opera &quot;Corazon Salvaje&quot;. This single is featured in Chayanne&#x27;s 2010 release, &quot;No Hay Imposibles&quot;.

On March 14, 2015, Chayanne released a new single titled, &quot;Tu respiración&quot;, serving as the theme song for the 2015 soap opera &quot;Lo imperdonable&quot;.

===Acting career===

In the 1980s, Chayanne participated in several soap operas and starred in the comedy series &quot;Generaciones&quot; with Luis Antonio Rivera. In 1994 he played himself in &quot;Volver a empezar&quot; along with Yuri. That same year, he also starred in &quot;Linda Sara&quot; opposite former Miss Universe, Dayanara Torres. The film was written and directed by famous Puerto Rican filmmaker Jacobo Morales. In 1998, he starred in his first Hollywood role, playing a Cuban dancer along with Vanessa L. Williams in &quot;Dance with Me&quot;. He also made a guest appearance on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. In the next few years he worked in other projects like the Argentine soap opera &quot;Provócame&quot;, for which he made the soundtrack of the same name.

In 2008, Chayanne played the title role (of a vampire) on the television series &quot;Gabriel: Amor Inmortal&quot;. To familiarize himself with the concept he adopted a different daily schedule, sleeping during the day and working at night. He noted that the production wanted to &quot;make things look as real as possible&quot;, but that the adaptation process was difficult. The series debuted on September 28, 2008, on Mega TV.

===Personal life===
He is married to Marilisa Maronesa de Figueroa, with whom he has a son Lorenzo and a daughter, Isadora. The family lives in Miami Beach, Florida.

<text>In Irish mythology, Cas Corach was a hero who helped Caílte mac Rónáin kill three werewolf-like creatures, the daughters of Airitech who would come out of the Cave of Cruachan every year around Samhain and destroy sheep. The she-wolves liked music, so he aided in their slaying by playing a harp to attract and distract them and by persuading them to change to human form, while Caoilte cast a spear that penetrated all three, thereby killing them.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Celtic Mythology&quot; states that Cas Corach, (also spelt Cascorrach, Cas Corrach), is a harper of Tuatha Dé Danann, who played for St. Patrick. He follows Caílte to learn of the lore of the Fenians, as told in the Acallam na Senòrach. It makes no reference to Airitech or his werewolf daughters.

<text>In Irish mythology, the goddess Airmed (also given as Airmid) was one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. With her father Dian Cecht and brother Miach, she healed those injured in the Second Battle of Magh Tuiredh.

After her jealous father slew her brother, Miach, Airmed wept over her brother&#x27;s grave. Watered by her tears, all the healing herbs of the world (365 in number - according to the number of Miach&#x27;s joints and veins) sprung from the earth over Miach&#x27;s body, and Airmed collected and organized them all, spreading them on her cloak. Once again, their father lashed out, and scattered the herbs. For this reason, no living human knows all the secrets of herbalism. Only Airmed remembers.

Along with Dian Cecht, Ochtriullach, and Miach, Airmed was one of the enchanters whose incantation sung over the well of Sláine and was able to resurrect the dead.

<doc id="85936" wikidata="Q2035597" url="?curid=85936" title="Alaunus">
<text>Alaunus or Alaunius (Gaulish: &quot;Alaunos&quot;) is a Gaulish god of healing and prophecy . His name is known from inscriptions found in Lurs, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence in Southern France and in Mannheim in western Germany. In the latter inscription, Alaunus is used as an epithet of Mercury. The feminine form &quot;Alauna&quot; (from an earlier *&quot;Alamnā&quot;) is at the origin of many place-names and hydronyms across Europe, including the Roman-era names of Valognes in Normandy, Maryport and Watercrook in Cumbria, River Alyn in North Wales, Alcester in Warwickshire, Ardoch in Perthshire, and Learchild and the River Aln in Northumberland.

== Name ==
The Gaulish theonym &quot;Alaunos&quot; stems from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *&quot;Alamnos&quot;. The etymology remains uncertain. It has been traditionally derived from the root *&quot;al&quot;- (&#x27;feed, raise, nurture&#x27;), and compared with the Latin &quot;alumnus&quot; (&#x27;nursling&#x27;) and with names of rivers such as &quot;Almus&quot; in Moesia, &quot;Yealm&quot; (*&quot;Almii&quot;) in England, or &quot;Alme&quot; in Westphalia. *&quot;Alamnos&quot; could thus be translated as &#x27;the Nourishing One&#x27;.

A Gallic tribe named &quot;Alauni&quot; (Αλαυνοί) is also attested in Noricum, and linguist Xavier Delamarre has argued that the root &quot;alǝ&quot;-, meaning &#x27;to wander&#x27;, &quot;would suit river names as much as ethnic ones&quot;. In this view, *&quot;Alamnos&quot; may be compared with the Celtic stem *&quot;alamo&quot;- (&#x27;herd&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;alam&quot;, Welsh &quot;alaf&quot;), and the ethnonym &quot;Alauni&quot; rendered as the &#x27;errants&#x27; or the &#x27;nomads&#x27;, contrasting with the name of the &quot;Anauni&quot; (&#x27;the Staying Ones&#x27;).

<text>Caturix (Gaulish for &quot;battle king&quot;) was the war god of the Helvetii.

==Names==
Caturix became known as &quot;Mars Caturix&quot; in Gallo-Roman religion by interpretation as Mars. There was a temple dedicated to Mars Caturix in Aventicum, the capital of Roman &quot;Helvetia&quot;, another one in Nonfoux, Essertines-sur-Yverdon. 

Other names (epitheta) of Caturix may have been &quot;Cicollus&quot; and &quot;Caisivus&quot;. &quot;Caturix&quot; has itself been interpreted as originating as an epithet of Toutatis.

==Etymology==
The Gaulish name &quot;catu-rix&quot; means &#x27;battle-king&#x27; or &#x27;battle-lord&#x27;, stemming from Gaulish root &quot;catu&quot;- (&#x27;combat, battle&#x27;) attached to &quot;rix&quot; (&#x27;king&#x27;). The root &quot;catu-&quot; is cognate to similar words in Celtic languages, including Old Irish &quot;cath&quot; (&#x27;battle, troop&#x27;) and Old Welsh &quot;cad&quot; (&#x27;battle&#x27;), and is attested in other Celtic personal names such as &quot;Catigern&quot;.

The Gallic tribe of the Caturiges (&#x27;battle-kings&#x27;), settling in the area of modern Chorges (from Latin: &quot;Caturigumagus&quot;) was apparently named after the god. The capital of the Caturiges was called &quot;Eburodunum&quot; (modern Embrun), i.e. the same name as that of Yverdon, suggesting a close relationship between the &quot;Caturiges&quot; and the &quot;Helvetii&quot;.

==Inscriptions==
Five dedicatory inscriptions to Caturix were found in the area settled by the Helvetii, all of them close to Avenches (Aventicum) and Yverdon (Eburodunum). A sixth inscription has been found in isolation in Böckingen, Heilbronn, Germany.

<text>Alisanos (Latinized as &quot;Alisaunus&quot;) was a local Gallo-Roman god worshipped in what is now the Côte-d&#x27;Or in Burgundy and at Aix-en-Provence.

== Name ==
The Gaulish theonym &quot;Alisanos&quot; is generally derived from the word &quot;alisia&quot;, meaning either &#x27;rock, boulder&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;ail&quot;) or &#x27;whitebeam&#x27; (cf. French &quot;alisier&quot;), which is also found in the toponym &quot;Alesia&quot;. Miranda Green interpreted &quot;Alisanos&quot; as a mountain-god. Alternatively, the stem &quot;Alisa-&quot; has been phonologically compared to the Proto-Celtic noun *&quot;alisā&quot;, meaning &#x27;alder&#x27;.
== Attestations ==
The inscription from Gevrey-Chambertin in the Côte-d&#x27;Or is in the Gaulish language:
:
:&quot;Doiros (son) of Segomaros has dedicated (this) to Alisanos&quot;

The inscription from Visignot, also in the Côte-d&#x27;Or, is in Latin:
: ❧
:&quot;Paullinus has freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow to the god Alisanus on behalf of his son Contedius&quot;

<text>In Welsh mythology, Amaethon ( (), meaning &quot;Amaethon son of Dôn&quot;) was the god of agriculture, and the son of the goddess Dôn and Beli Mawr, and brother to Arianrhod, Penarddun, Gilfaethwy, Gofannon, Gwydion, and Nudd. His name means &quot;labourer&quot; or &quot;ploughman&quot;, and he is cited as being responsible for the Cad Goddeu, or &quot;Battle of Trees&quot;, between the lord of the otherworld, Arawn, and the Children of Dôn (the Welsh version of the Tuatha Dé Danann).

==Sources==
The principal reference to Amaethon appears in the medieval Welsh prose tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, where he was the only man who could till a certain field, one of the impossible tasks Culhwch had been set before he could win Olwen&#x27;s hand.

In the obscure early Welsh poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;, a possible reference is made to Amaethon/Amathaon, but the passage is obscure. One possible interpretation, if the reading is accepted, is that he steals a dog, lapwing and roebuck from Arawn, king of Annwn (the otherworld), leading to a battle between Arawn and the Children of Dôn. Gwydion used his magic staff to turn trees into warriors who helped the children of Dôn win.

In one of the triads invented by Iolo Morganwg, he teaches magic to his brother Gwydion (this is not accepted as a genuine medieval triad by modern scholars).

==Etymology==
This is derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Ambaxtonos&quot; meaning great follower, servant or ploughman, an augmentative form of &quot;ambactos&quot; (ultimately from &quot;*ambhi-ag-to-&quot;).

<text>*Danu () is a hypothesised entity in Irish mythology whose sole attestation is in the genitive in the name of the Tuatha dé Danann, which may mean &#x27;the peoples of the goddess Danu&#x27; in Old Irish. Despite a complete absence from the primary texts, some later Victorian folklorists attempted to ascribe certain attributes to Danu, such as association with motherhood or agricultural prosperity.

== Etymology ==
The hypothetical nominative form of the name, &quot;*Danu&quot;, is not found in any medieval Irish text, but is rather a reconstruction by modern scholars based on the genitive &quot;Danann&quot; (also spelled &quot;Donand&quot; or &quot;Danand&quot;), which is the only form attested in the primary sources (e.g. in the collective name of the Irish gods, &quot;Tuatha dé Danann&quot; &quot;Tribe / People of Danu&quot;). In Irish mythology, &quot;Anu&quot; (sometimes written as &quot;Anann&quot; or &quot;Anand&quot;) is a goddess. She may be a distinct goddess in her own right or an alternative name for Danu, in which case &quot;Danu&quot; could be a contraction of &quot;*di[a] Anu&quot; (&quot;goddess Anu&quot;). It may also be a confusion arising from Anu and the phrase &quot;na trí dée dána&quot;.

The etymology of the name has been a matter of much debate since the 19th century, with some earlier scholars favoring a link with the Vedic water goddess Danu, whose name is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*dʰenh₂-&quot; &quot;to run, to flow&quot;, which may also lie behind the ancient name for the river Danube, &quot;Danuuius&quot; – perhaps of Celtic origin, though it is also possible that it is an early Scythian loanword in Celtic.

MacLeod connects Danu to the Old Irish word &quot;dán,&quot; which refers to an artistic skill. In early Ireland, artisans and other skilled workers were known as &quot;aes dánaˆ,&quot; or &quot;people of skill.&quot;

Linguist Eric Hamp rejects the traditional etymologies in his 2002 examination of the name &quot;Danu&quot;, and proposes instead that &quot;*Danu&quot; is derived from the same root as Latin &quot;bonus&quot; (Old Latin &quot;duenos&quot;) from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*dueno-&quot; &quot;good&quot;, via a Proto-Celtic nominative singular n-stem &quot;*Duonū&quot; (&quot;aristocrat&quot;).

==In mythology==
Danu has no surviving myths or legends associated with her in any of the medieval Irish texts.

===Approximate matches &quot;Anu&quot; and &quot;Danand&quot; in Irish texts===
&quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot;, a text that predates the &quot;Lebor Gabala Erenn&quot;, names the goddess &quot;Anu&quot; as the mother of the gods.Some scholars suggest that Danu was a conflation of Anu and is the same goddess. This may also connect Danu to The Morrígan, which some scholars say is an epithet for Anu.

The closest figure in Irish texts to a &quot;Danu&quot; would then be &quot;Danand&quot;, daughter of Delbáeth. In the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Taking of Ireland&quot;), it is noted the &quot;Tuatha dé Danann&quot; get their name from Danand and Delbáeth&#x27;s three sons: Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba. These three are called the &quot;Gods of Dannan&quot;. MacLeod notes that Danu&#x27;s three sons might be better fit by the craftsmen deities, Goibniu, Luchta, and Creidhne and suggests that the gods of danu may refer to them.

Danu&#x27;s association with fertility can be seen in relation to the Paps of Danu (also known as the Paps of Anu), Paps meaning &quot;breasts.&quot;

Another possible match is in the Dindsenchas poem on &quot;Codal&quot;, which refers to a Danainn, wife of Ganaan. Danainn is the mother of a daughter named Gorn.

Some texts list Danu as a &quot;bantúathach&quot; (witch or sorceress) or &quot;bandrúi&quot; (female druid) of the &quot;Tuatha Dé Danaan&quot;.

===Welsh parallels===
She has possible parallels with the Welsh legendary figure Dôn in the medieval tales of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, whom most modern scholars consider to be a mythological mother goddess. This may be supported by theories that Dôn&#x27;s name may also come from a root referring to rivers. This connection also supports the theory that the gods of skill associated with Danu are Goibhniu and his two brothers, as one of Dôn&#x27;s offspring is Gofannon, the Welsh equivalent of Goibhniu.

However, Dôn&#x27;s gender is not specified in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and some medieval Welsh antiquarians presumed Dôn to be male.

Dôn&#x27;s divine offspring include Gofannon, the Welsh equivalent of Goibniu.

<text>Beli (Old Norse: ) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. He is said in eddic poetry to have been killed by the god Freyr.
Saturn&#x27;s moon Beli is named after him.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name has been translated as &#x27;roarer&#x27;. It is related to the Old Norse weak verb (&#x27;to roar&#x27;; Icelandic , Old Swedish &#x27;to roar&#x27;).

== Attestations ==

=== Eddas ===
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (The Beguiling of Gylfi), the god Freyr is forced to fight weaponless against the giant Beli, since he has given his sword to his servant Skírnir before sending him to court Gerðr for his master. Freyr eventually manages to kill the giant with the antler of a hart (stag).

In &quot;Völuspá&quot; (Prophecy of the Völva), Freyr is portrayed as &quot;Beli&#x27;s slayer&quot; (&quot;bani Belja&quot;, ).

=== Skaldic poetry ===
In &quot;Háleygjatal&quot;, written by 10th-century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir, Freyr is called &quot;Beli&#x27;s enemy&quot; (&quot;Belja dólgr&quot;), and Þjóðólfr of Hvinir uses the kenning &quot;evil troop of Beli&quot; (&quot;bölverðung Belja&quot;) in his &quot;Haustlöng&quot;.

== Theories ==
According to scholar John Lindow, the killing of Beli is part of an older myth that has been lost and &quot;can be glimpsed only in passing&quot;.

Elsewhere in &quot;Skírnismál&quot; (The Lay of Skírnir), Gerðr complains of the slaying of her brother by Frey, which some scholars have interpreted as evidence that she was the sister of Beli. According to Orchard, &quot;it is clear that Gerd’s reluctance to accept Frey’s favours is based in no small part on her grief for her unnamed brother, whom Frey might have killed. It is therefore possible that Beli is the brother of Gerd, although Frey’s traditional weaponlessness, most tellingly at Ragnarok against Surt, renders the identification uncertain.&quot;

<text>Burying beetles or sexton beetles, genus Nicrophorus, are the best-known members of the family Silphidae (carrion beetles). Most of these beetles are black with red markings on the elytra (forewings). Burying beetles are true to their name—they bury the carcasses of small vertebrates such as birds and rodents as a food source for their larvae; this makes them carnivorous. They are unusual among insects in that both the male and female parents take care of the brood.

The genus name is sometimes spelled &quot;Necrophorus&quot; in older texts: this was an unjustified emendation by Carl Peter Thunberg (1789) of Fabricius&#x27;s original name, and is not valid under the ICZN.

The American burying beetle (&quot;Nicrophorus americanus&quot;) has been on the U.S. endangered species list since 1989. This species was native to 35 U.S. states but now is only known to exist in 9.

==Reproduction==
Burying beetles have large club-like antennae equipped with chemoreceptors capable of detecting a dead animal from a long distance. After finding a carcass (most usually that of a small bird or a mouse), beetles fight amongst themselves (males fighting males, females fighting females) until the winning pair (usually the largest) remains. If a lone beetle finds a carcass, it may continue alone and await a partner. Single males attract mates by releasing a pheromone from the tip of their abdomens. Females can raise a brood alone, fertilizing her eggs using sperm stored from previous copulations. The carcass is usually buried by the beetle(s) to hide it from potential competitors, which are numerous.

An example of a species of &quot;Nicrophorus&quot; that displays this form of bi-parental care and burying activity is &quot;Nicrophorus nepalensis&quot;. Pairs of &quot;Nicrophorus nepalensis&quot; prepare carcasses and care for the developing larvae in a joint fashion. After burying a carcass, the beetles mate and lay eggs near/on the carcass. When the eggs hatch into larvae they begin feeding on the flesh of the carcass. The adults remain until the larvae begin to pupate.

Burying beetle life cycle

The prospective parents begin to dig a hole below the carcass. While doing so, and after removing all hair from the carcass, the beetles cover the animal with antibacterial and antifungal oral and anal secretions, slowing the decay of the carcass and preventing the smell of rotting flesh from attracting competition. The carcass is formed into a ball and the fur or feathers stripped away and used to line and reinforce the crypt, also known as a nursery, where the carcass will remain until the flesh has been completely consumed. The burial process can take around 8 hours. Several pairs of beetles may cooperate to bury large carcasses and then raise their broods communally.

The female burying beetle lays eggs in the soil around the crypt. The larvae hatch after a few days and move into a pit in the carcass which the parents have created. Although the larvae are able to feed themselves, both parents also feed the larvae in response to begging: they digest the flesh and regurgitate liquid food for the larvae to feed on, a form of progressive provisioning. This probably speeds up larval development. It is also thought the parent beetles can produce secretions from head glands that have anti-microbial activity, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi on the vertebrate corpse.

The adult beetles continue to protect the larvae, which take several days to mature. Many competitors make this task difficult, e.g. bluebottles and ants or burying beetles of either another or the same species. Throughout the entirety of the larva&#x27;s development, the parents fight off these competitors all the while maintaining an ideal nursery inside the carcass for their offspring. The final-stage larvae migrate into the soil and pupate, transforming from larvae to fully formed adult beetles.

Parental care (and particularly biparental care) is quite rare among insects that are not eusocial (e.g. ants and honey bees). Burying beetles are exceptional in exhibiting this trait, and thus fall under the category of subsocial insects.

== Infanticide ==
Burying beetles are known to commit infanticide at an early stage, which is also known as culling their young. This is done to ensure that the supply of food provided by the carcass is sufficient to nourish all the larvae sufficiently. If there are too many young, they will all be underfed and will develop less quickly, reducing their chances of surviving to adulthood. If there are too few young, the resulting adult beetles will be large but the parents could have produced more of them. The most successful beetle parents will achieve a good balance between the size of offspring and the number produced. This method of brood size regulation might be the result of the eggs being laid before the female has been able to gauge the size of the carcass and hence how many larvae it can provision.

== Conservation ==
As of 2020, the American burying beetle (&quot;N. americanus&quot;) was reclassified from the endangered category to threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Burying beetles are important to the ecosystem and aid in nutrient recycling by burying dead animals. This allows for the nutrient-rich carcass to be recycled by the system.

<text>Gwydion fab Dôn () is a magician, hero and trickster of Welsh mythology, appearing most prominently in the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, which focuses largely on his relationship with his young nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes. He also appears prominently in the &quot;Welsh Triads&quot;, the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot; and the &quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot;.

The name Gwydion may be interpreted as &quot;Born of Trees&quot;.

==Mythological exploits==

===War with the South===
Gilfaethwy, nephew to the Venedotian king, Math fab Mathonwy, becomes obsessed with his uncle&#x27;s virgin foot-holder, Goewin. His brother Gwydion conspires to start a war between the north and the south. To this end, Gwydion employs his magic powers to steal a number of otherworldly pigs from the Demetian king, Pryderi, who retaliates by marching on Gwynedd. During the war, while Math is distracted, the brothers return home and Gilfaethwy rapes Goewin.

Pryderi and his men march north and fight a battle between Maenor Bennardd and Maenor Coed Alun, but are forced to retreat. He is pursued to Nant Call, where more of his men are slaughtered, and then to Dol Benmaen, where he suffers a third defeat. To avoid further bloodshed, it is agreed that the outcome of the battle should be decided by single combat between Gwydion and Pryderi. The two contenders meet at a place called &quot;Y Velen Rhyd&quot; in Ardudwy, and &quot;because of strength and valour and magic and enchantment&quot;, Gwydion triumphs and Pryderi is killed. The men of Dyfed retreat back to their own land, lamenting over the death of their lord.

===Birth of Lleu===
When Math hears of the assault on Goewin, he turns his nephews into a series of mated pairs of animals: Gwydion becomes a stag for a year, then a sow and finally a wolf. Gilfaethwy becomes a hind, a wild boar and a she-wolf. Each year they produce an offspring which is sent to Math: Hyddwn, Hychddwn and Bleiddwn. After three years, Math releases his nephews from their punishment and begins the search for a new foot-holder. Gwydion suggests his sister Arianrhod, who is magically tested for virginity by Math. During the test, she gives birth to a &quot;sturdy boy with thick yellow hair&quot; whom Math names Dylan and who takes on the nature of the seas until his death at his uncle Gofannon&#x27;s hands.

Ashamed, Arianrhod runs to the door, but on her way out something small drops from her, which Gwydion wraps up and places in a chest at the foot of his bed. Some time later, he hears screams from within the chest, and opens it to discover a baby boy. Some scholars have suggested that in an earlier form of the Fourth Branch, Gwydion was the father of Arianrhod&#x27;s sons.

===The &quot;tynghedau&quot; of Arianrhod===
Some years later, Gwydion accompanies the boy to Caer Arianrhod, and presents him to his mother. The furious Arianrhod, shamed by this reminder of her loss of virginity, places a &quot;tynged&quot; on the boy: that only she could give him a name. Gwydion however tricks his sister by disguising himself and the boy as cobblers and luring Arianrhod into going to them in person in order to have some shoes made for her. The boy throws a stone and strikes a wren &quot;between the tendon and the bone of its leg&quot;, causing Arianrhod to make the remark &quot;it is with a skillful hand that the fair-haired one has hit it &quot;. At that Gwydion reveals himself, saying ; &quot;the fair-haired one with the skillful hand,&quot; is his name now&quot;. Furious at this trickery, Arianrhod places another &quot;tynged&quot; on Lleu: he shall receive arms from no one but Arianrhod herself. Gwydion tricks his sister once again, and she unwittingly arms Lleu herself, leading to her placing a third &quot;tynged&quot; on him: that he shall never have a human wife.

So as to counteract Arianrhod&#x27;s curse, Math and Gwydion:

===Lleu&#x27;s death and resurrection===
Blodeuwedd has an affair with Gronw Pebr, the lord of Penllyn, and the two conspire to murder Lleu. Blodeuwedd tricks Lleu into revealing how he may be killed, since he can not be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made. He reveals to her that he can only be killed at dusk, wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat and with a spear forged for a year during the hours when everyone is at mass. With this information she arranges his death.

Struck by the spear thrown by Gronw&#x27;s hand, Lleu transforms into an eagle and flies away. Gwydion tracks him down and finds him perched high on an oak tree. Through the singing of an englyn (known as englyn Gwydion) he lures him down from the oak tree and switches him back to his human form. Gwydion and Math nurse Lleu back to health before reclaiming his lands from Gronw and Blodeuwedd. In the face-off between Lleu and Gronw, Gronw asks if he may place a large stone between himself and Lleu&#x27;s spear. Lleu allows him to do so, then throws his spear which pierces both the stone and Gronw, killing him. Gwydion corners Blodeuwedd and turns her into an owl, the creature hated by all other birds. The tale ends with Lleu ascending to the throne of Gwynedd.

===The Battle of the Trees===
A large tradition seems to have once surrounded the Battle of the Trees, a mythological conflict fought between the sons of Dôn and the forces of Annwn, the Welsh Otherworld. Amaethon, Gwydion&#x27;s brother, steals a white roebuck and a whelp from Arawn, king of the otherworld, leading to a great battle.

Gwydion fights alongside his brother and, assisted by Lleu, enchants the &quot;elementary trees and sedges&quot; to rise up as warriors against Arawn&#x27;s forces. The alder leads the attack, while the aspen falls in battle, and heaven and earth tremble before the oak, a &quot;valiant door keeper against the enemy&quot;. The bluebells combine and cause a &quot;consternation&quot; but the hero is the holly, tinted with green.

A warrior fighting alongside Arawn cannot be vanquished unless his enemies can guess his name. Gwydion guesses the warrior&#x27;s name, identifying him from the sprigs of alder on his shield, and sings two englyns:

:&quot;Sure-hoofed is my steed impelled by the spur;
:The high sprigs of alder are on thy shield;
:Bran art thou called, of the glittering branches.&quot;

:Sure-hoofed is my steed in the day of battle:
:The high sprigs of alder are on thy hand:
:Bran by the branch thou bearest
:Has Amathaon the good prevailed.&quot;

===Other traditions===
Caer Wydion, the castle of Gwydion, was the traditional Welsh name for the Milky Way.

In the 10th century, Old Welsh &quot;Harleian&quot; genealogies (Harleian MS 3859), mention is made of Lou Hen (&quot;Lou the old&quot;) map Guidgen, who most scholars identify with Lleu and Gwydion (who is implied to be Lleu&#x27;s father in the Mabinogi of Math, though this relationship is not explicitly stated). In the genealogy they are made direct descendants Caratauc son of Cinbelin son of Teuhant (&quot;recte Tehuant&quot;), who are to be identified with the historical Catuvellaunian leaders Caratacus, Cunobelinus and Tasciovanus.

A number of references to Gwydion can be found in early Welsh poetry. The poem &quot;Prif Gyuarch Taliessin&quot; asks &quot;Lleu and Gwydion / Will they perform magics?&quot;, while in the same corpus, the poem &quot;Kadeir Cerridwen&quot; relates many familiar traditions concerning Gwydion, including his creating of a woman out of flowers and his bringing of the pigs from the south. This poem also refers to a lost tradition concerning a battle between Gwydion and an unknown enemy at the Nant Ffrangon. Another Taliesin poem, &quot;Echrys Ynys&quot; refers to Gwynedd as the &quot;Land of Gwydion&quot; while in the &quot;Ystoria Taliesin&quot;, the legendary bard claims to have been present at Gwydion&#x27;s birth &quot;before the court of Don&quot;.
The Welsh Triads name Gwydion as one of the &quot;Three Golden Shoemakers of the Island of Britain&quot; alongside Manawydan fab Llyr and Caswallawn fab Beli, and records that Math taught him one of the &quot;Three Great Enchantments&quot;. The &quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot; record that he was buried at Dinas Dinlle, the city of Lleu.

A reference to Gwydion is also made in the &quot;Dialogue of Taliesin and Ugnach&quot;, a dialogue-poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen. Within the narrative, the character of Taliesin states:

:&quot;When I return from Caer Seon
:From contending with Jews
:I will come to the city of Lleu and Gwydion.&quot;

==Gwydion in other media==
Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, a series of children&#x27;s fantasy novels inspired by Welsh myths, features a character named Gwydion that is based on the Gwydion of myth but markedly different in moral character. In the Prydain chronicles, Prince Gwydion is a member of the Sons of Don, Prydain&#x27;s ruling house, and King Math&#x27;s war leader; he succeeds to the throne when High King Math is slain. Gwydion meets Taran when that Assistant Pig-Keeper chases after his charge, the pig Hen Wen, who has fled their home. Man and boy travel together for some time, until they are captured and separated at Spiral Castle. In the first three books of the five-novel series, Gwydion defeats the Horned King by shouting his real name, leads the quest to secure the Black Cauldron, and helps Taran, Fflewddur Fflam, Gurgi and Prince Rhun rescue Princess Eilonwy from the sorceress Achren. Finally he leads the defense of Caer Dathyl and, as High King, the assault on Annuvin by the sea. In the books, Prince Gwydion is an expert tracker, forester and warrior. As a member of the Royal House of Don, he often wears a pendant depicting a simple golden disk meant to represent the sun.

Patricia Kennealy-Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Keltiad&quot; series—Irish, Welsh and Scottish legends translated to an interstellar, &quot;Star Wars&quot; style context—has a character named Gwydion Prince of Don as its co-protagonist. Like Alexander, Kennealy-Morrison bases her character on the mythological Gwydion, but humanizes him through her own creative process. Lover and First Lord of War to the Queen of Keltia, Aeron Aoibhell, Gwydion ultimately becomes Aeron&#x27;s husband and King of Keltia, while having numerous adventures based on episodes from the various branches of the Mabinogion. He is a gifted bard, sorcerer and warrior, close to (and descended from) the magical Sidhefolk of Keltia, and is portrayed as Aeron&#x27;s true and loving partner and her equal in most things. He takes a major part in the epic Battle of the Trees that ends &quot;The Throne of Scone&quot;, the chronological last of the books published.

Gwydion is briefly featured in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2001 novel &quot;American Gods&quot;. He appears as young, eager, acne-prone stockboy at a supermarket in Humansville, Missouri.

Gwydion was a prominent character in the 2003 animated film &quot;Y Mabinogi&quot;, in which he was voiced by Philip Madoc.

He also appears in Phillip Mann&#x27;s alternate history series &quot;A Land Fit for Heroes&quot;, Judith Tarr&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;The Hound and the Falcon&quot; and the &quot;Alamut series&quot;, Robert Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Language of Stones&quot; series, the books of the Welsh author Jenny Sullivan and in Jenny Nimmo&#x27;s &quot;Snow Spider Trilogy&quot;. In &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, Gwydion is the birth name of both King Arthur and Mordred. Gwydion is given as the real identity of the mage Click, who appears as a minor supporting character in the Junkyard druid series by M D Massey, finally being revealed in book 7, Druid Vengeance. A minor character named Gwydion appears in &quot;The Oaken Throne&quot; by Robin Jarvis. He is also included in Alan Garner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Owl Service&quot; through the character of Huw Halfbacon (the last name a reference to stealing pigs).

The name Gwydion also appears in the Sierra game &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III&quot;, where a Prince Alexander of Daventry has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Manannan who renames him Gwydion.

In the 2018 video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, Gwydion is the name of Josiah Trelawny&#x27;s horse.

In the novel, The Wild Huntress by Emily Lloyd-Jones, Gwydion features as a main character, a Prince of Gwynedd, in this retelling of the Wild Hunt in Annwvyn.

<text>In Welsh mythology, Gilfaethwy () was a son of the goddess Dôn and brother of Gwydion and Arianrhod in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi.

His uncle Math fab Mathonwy, king of Gwynedd, must keep his feet in the lap of a young virgin at all times unless he is going to war. Gilfaethwy lusts after Math&#x27;s current foot holder, Goewin, so to get her alone he and Gwydion steal pigs from Pryderi, king of Dyfed, sparking a conflict between the neighboring kingdoms. While his uncle is off fighting, Gilfaethwy sneaks back to Gwynedd and rapes Goewin. Math is furious when he discovers this, and punishes his nephews by transforming them into a series of paired animals using his great skill in magic, thus impressing vividly upon them the brutish (and brutal) nature of their transgressions. For a year Gilfaethwy becomes a hind deer and Gwydion a stag; they mate and produce an offspring, Hyddwn, which is delivered to Math. Next Math makes Gilfaethwy a boar and Gwydion a sow, and together they birth Hychddwn; when they return a year later with the sons, he makes them wolves, and finally they give birth to Bleiddwn. After the third year he relieves them of their punishment and makes them human again.

Gilfaethwy is a minor character in Welsh legend, and may have been used in the Fourth Branch simply to advance the story of his more illustrious brother Gwydion.

==In Arthurian romance==
Like many another character in the Mabinogion, Gilfaethwy has given rise to a character or characters in Arthurian romance - in this instance Sir Griflet, who first appears as &quot;Girflet ( or Giflet ) fils Do&quot; in the romance &quot;Erec et Enide &quot; by the twelfth century Champénois master Chrétien de Troyes and appears later as the eponymous hero of the romance &quot;Jaufre&quot;, the only surviving romance written in the Occitan language.

Loomis wrote that Dôn, goddess mother of Gilfaethwy, had been misconstrued to be a male character by at least as early as the time of composition of Chretien&#x27;s &quot;Erec et Enide&quot; : The Arthurian &quot;Do&quot; or &quot;Don&quot;, father of &quot;Giflet&quot; and &quot;Lore&quot;, has undergone a strange metamorphosis, from an ancient Brythonic goddess into the castellan of Carlisle and the chief forester of &quot;Uterpandragon&quot;.

The &quot;Lore&quot; in the above-quoted passage concerning &quot;Don&quot; is an abbreviated form of &quot;Florée&quot;, the Flower Bride, an Arthurian cognate of the Irish Blathnat and Welsh Blodeuwedd.

<text>Goewin () is a figure in Welsh mythology, where she has a small but crucial role in the &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;, one of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi.

==Narrative==
At the beginning of the tale, the eponymous Math fab Mathonwy will die if his feet are not always held in the lap of a virgin or he is at war; Goewin is the virgin who performs this duty until Math is tricked into going to war by his nephews Gwydion and Gilfaethwy, who proceed to rape Goewin. Once Math returns, Goewin reveals the crime and Math punishes the two by transforming them into a series of animals. He then marries Goewin, giving her power over his kingdom, in order to make amends.

<text>Pryderi fab Pwyll is a prominent figure in Welsh mythology, the son of Pwyll and Rhiannon, and king of Dyfed after his father&#x27;s death. He is the only character to appear in all Four Branches of the Mabinogi, although the size of his role varies from tale to tale. He is often equated with the divine son figure of Mabon ap Modron, while Jeffrey Gantz compares him to Peredur fab Efrawg, who is himself associated with the continental figure of Sir Percival de Galles.

Ifor Williams speculated that he was once the focal character of the Mabinogi as a whole, although some subsequent scholars disagree with this theory.

Pryderi is described by Jeffrey Gantz as &quot;bold and enterprising, but rash to the point of foolishness.&quot; He goes on to say that &quot;his downfall, while pathetic, is not entirely undeserved.&quot;

==Role in Welsh mythology==
===Birth and early life===
Pryderi was born in Arberth to Pwyll, Lord of Dyfed, and Rhiannon, daughter of Hyfaidd Hen. On the night of his birth, he disappeared while in the care of six of Rhiannon&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting. To avoid the king&#x27;s wrath, they smeared dog&#x27;s blood onto a sleeping Rhiannon, claiming that she had committed infanticide and cannibalism by eating her child.

Teyrnon, Lord of Gwent Is Coed, had a mare which gave birth each year but whose foals had all disappeared. Teyrnon watched his stables and saw a mysterious clawed beast coming to take the foal; Teyrnon cut off the beast&#x27;s arm and found the child outside the stable. He and his wife claimed the boy as their own and named him Gwri Wallt Euryn (English: &quot;Gwri of the Golden hair&quot;), for &quot;all the hair was as yellow as gold.&quot;

The child grew to adulthood at a superhuman pace and, as he matured, his likeness to Pwyll grew more obvious; and eventually Teyrnon realised Gwri&#x27;s true identity. The boy was eventually reconciled with Pwyll and Rhiannon and was renamed &quot;Pryderi&quot;. From then on, he was fostered by Pendaran Dyfed and was &quot;brought up carefully, as was proper, until he was the most handsome lad, and the fairest, and the most accomplished at every worthy feat in the kingdom.&quot;

After his father&#x27;s death, Pryderi became ruler of the seven cantrefi of Dyfed and set about expanding his territories by conquering Ystrad Tywi and Ceredigion. He was occupied with this conquest until he chose to take a wife, eventually marrying Cigfa, the daughter of Gwyn Gohoyw. He also succeeded in amalgamating the seven cantrefi of Morgannwg into his kingdom, although the conquest itself is not referenced in any texts.

===The Assembly of Branwen and Matholwch===

Branwen, sister of Bendigeidfrân (Brân the Blessed), king of Britain, is given in marriage to Matholwch, king of Ireland. Branwen&#x27;s half-brother Efnisien, angry that he was not consulted, insults Matholwch by mutilating his horses but Bendigeidfrân gives him compensation in the form of new horses and treasure, including a magical cauldron which can restore the dead to life. After returning to Ireland Matholwch and Branwen have a son, Gwern, but Efnisien&#x27;s insult continues to rankle among the Irish and Branwen is banished to the kitchen and beaten every day. Branwen trains a starling to take a message to Bendigeidfrân, who raises a vast host and goes to war against Ireland. Pryderi accompanies him.

The British army crosses the Irish Sea in ships, but Bendigeidfrân is so huge he wades across. The Irish offer to make peace and build a house big enough to entertain Bendigeidfrân but hang a hundred bags inside, supposedly containing flour but actually containing armed warriors. Efnisien, suspecting a trick, reconnoitres the hall and kills the warriors by crushing their heads inside the bags. Later, at the feast, Efnisien, again feeling insulted, throws Gwern on the fire and fighting breaks out. Seeing that the Irish are using the cauldron to revive their dead, Efnisien hides among the corpses and destroys the cauldron, sacrificing himself in the process.

Pryderi is one of only seven men to survive the violent battle. He and his companions are told by the mortally wounded Bendigeidfrân to cut off his head and to return it to Britain. The survivors stay in Harlech, where they are entertained by Bendigeidfran&#x27;s head, which continues to speak. They later move on to Gwales (often identified with Grassholm Island off Dyfed) where they live for eighty years without perceiving the passing of time. Eventually, Heilyn ap Gwyn opens the door of the hall facing Cornwall and the sorrow of what had befallen them returns. As instructed they take the now silent head to the Gwynfryn, the &quot;White Hill&quot; (thought to be the location where the Tower of London now stands), where they bury it facing France so as to ward off invasion.

===Return to Britain===

Pryderi invites Manawydan, Bendigeidfran&#x27;s brother and a fellow survivor, to live with him in Dyfed, arranging for him to marry his widowed mother Rhiannon. Soon after, Pryderi, Cigfa, Manawydan and Rhiannon ascend a magical hill and, when they descend, Dyfed had turned into a barren wasteland with no inhabitants. Pryderi and Manawydan travel to England to make a living from various trades, but were forced to leave one town after another to avoid conflicts with other tradesmen who resented their superior skills.

Returning to Dyfed, Manaywdan and Pryderi go hunting and, coming across a white boar, follow it to a huge, towering fort. Against Manawydan&#x27;s advice, Pryderi enters the fort and is drawn towards a beautiful golden bowl. Upon touching the bowl, his feet stick to the floor, his hands stick to the bowl and he loses the power of speech. Manawydan waits in vain for his return before giving news of his disappearance to Rhiannon. Chiding her husband for his poor companionship, Rhiannon too enters the fort and suffers the same fate as her son. In a &quot;blanket of mist&quot;, Pryderi, Rhiannon and the fort itself, vanish.

Some time later, Manawydan&#x27;s cunning frees them from their imprisonment. It is revealed that the catalyst of their suffering was the enchanter Llwyd ap Cil Coed, who sought revenge for the humiliation of his friend Gwawl ap Clud at the hands of Pwyll and Rhiannon. The enchantement over Dyfed is lifted.

===Invasion of Gwynedd and Death===

Some time later, Pryderi receives a number of otherworldly pigs from his father&#x27;s old ally, Arawn, king of Annwn, which are stolen through trickery by Gwydion, a Venedotian magician and warrior. Declaring war on Gwynedd, Pryderi and his men march north and fight a battle between Maenor Bennardd and Maenor Coed Alun. Both sides suffer heavy losses, but Math fab Mathonwy, king of Gwynedd is victorious and Pryderi is forced to retreat. He is pursued to Nant Call, where more of his men are slaughtered, and then to Dol Benmaen, where he suffers a third defeat.

To avoid further bloodshed, it is agreed that the outcome of the battle should be decided by single combat between Gwydion and Pryderi. The two contenders meet at a place called &quot;Y Velen Rhyd&quot; in Ardudwy, and &quot;because of strength and valour and magic and enchantment&quot;, Gwydion triumphs and Pryderi is killed. The men of Dyfed retreat back to their own land, lamenting over the death of their lord.

===Appearances in other texts===

The Welsh Triads name Pryderi as one of the &#x27;Three Powerful Swineherds of the Island of Britain&#x27;, referring to an occasion on which he guarded the pigs of his foster-father, Pendaran Dyfed at Glyn Cuch. An obscure reference is also made of Pryderi and his father in the cryptic early medieval poem &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot;:

:&quot;bu kyweir karchar gweir yg kaer sidi
: trwy ebostol pwyll a phryderi.
:Neb kyn noc ef nyt aeth idi.
:yr gadwyn trom las kywirwas ae ketwi.
:A rac preidu annwfyn tost yt geni.
: Ac yt urawt parahawt yn bardwedi.&quot;
This section of the poem suggests an enmity between Pryderi and a certain Gweir ap Gwystyl, who has been imprisoned in an otherworldly fortress through the &quot;ebestol&quot; of Pwyll and Pryderi. The exact meaning of the word &quot;ebestol&quot; is unclear, but has been variously translated as &quot;epistle&quot;, tales&quot;, &quot;account&quot;, &quot;spite&quot; and &quot;lies.&quot;

Pryderi is named once in the Welsh Triads, as one of the three powerful swineherds while the Stanzas of the Graves refer to his final resting place as: &quot;Aber Gwenoli...where the waves beat against the land.&quot; The Book of Taliesin poem &quot;Song before the sons of Llyr&quot; also mentions Pryderi and, as in other texts, associates him both with Manawydan fab Llyr and with the otherworldly fortress of Caer Sidi:
:Complete is my chair in Caer Sidi,
:No one will be afflicted with disease or old age that may be in it.
:It is known to Manawyd and Pryderi.
:Three utterances, around the fire, will he sing before it,
:And around its borders are the streams of the ocean.
:And the fruitful fountain is above it,
:Is sweeter than white wine the liquor therein.

The character is also referred to in the works of a number of bards, including Einion fab Gwalchmai, Howel Foel ap Griffri and Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr. The famous fourteenth century poet Dafydd ap Gwilym referred to Dyfed as &quot;Pryderi Dir&quot; (The Land of Pryderi.)

The children&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; features a character named King Pryderi. The character appears in the final book of the series, &quot;The High King&quot;. King Pryderi is a powerful monarch and warlord who betrays his liege lord, High King Math son of Mathonwy, and the House of Don, to side with Arawn Death-Lord. However, King Pryderi succumbs to his pride and ambition. When he ventures to Caer Dallben in an attempt to murder Dallben the enchanter and steal the Book of Three, he is killed by an enchantment protecting the book.

<text>In Welsh mythology, Math fab Mathonwy (), also called Math ap Mathonwy (Math, son of Mathonwy) was a king of Gwynedd who needed to rest his feet in the lap of a virgin unless he was at war, or he would die. The story of Math is the fourth of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi.

==The Mabinogi of Math==

===Math is tricked by his nephews===
Math&#x27;s nephew Gilfaethwy had become obsessed with Goewin, Math&#x27;s footholder. The magician Gwydion (Gilfaethwy&#x27;s brother) devised a plan to make Goewin available. Gwydion told his uncle about an animal that was new to Wales, called pigs, and how he could get them from their owner, Pryderi of Dyfed. He took a band of men, including his brother, to Ceredigion, where they disguised themselves as bards to gain audience with King Pryderi.

Gwydion was a skilled &quot;cyfarwydd&quot; (storyteller) and regaled the court with his tales. Having charmed the king, he offered to trade the pigs for some horses and dogs, which he had conjured through magic. Pryderi agreed to the trade and Gwydion and his men took the pigs back home to Gwynedd, but his trickery was revealed and Pryderi waged war against Gwynedd. While Math went to battle, Gilfaethwy raped Goewin.

The war ended when Gwydion killed Pryderi in single combat. Upon his return to his castle, King Math went to rest his feet in Goewin&#x27;s lap, but could not, as she was no longer a virgin. He took her as his wife to save her honour, and then as punishment, banished his nephews, turning them into a breeding pair of deer for a year. He then turned them into wild boars for the next year and wolves the year after that. They had three children over the three years: Hyddwn, Hychddwn, and Bleiddwn.

===Gwydion and his nephew===
After their punishment was over, Math asked their advice as to who should be his next virgin footholder. Gwydion suggested his sister, Arianrhod. However, Arianrhod was not a virgin, and when asked to step over Math&#x27;s rod in order to prove her virginity she immediately gave birth to a son. Abandoning the child she fled in shame, letting drop a &quot;lump of flesh&quot; which was borne away by Gwydion and concealed in a chest. When Gwydion later opens the chest he discovered the lump of flesh to be a second child.

Meanwhile, the firstborn son of Arianrhod was acknowledged by his great uncle Math and given the name &quot;Dylan&quot; upon baptism. However, as soon as Dylan came in contact with his baptismal waters, he plunged into the sea and took on characteristics of a sea creature, moving through the seawater as perfectly as any fish, thus earning his new name, Dylan ail Don, &quot;Dylan second wave&quot;: &quot;So they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he plunged into the sea. And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its nature, and swam as well as the best fish that was therein.&quot;

The unnamed second child grew precociously and he and Gwydion grew very attached to one another. After four years Gwydion took the boy to see his mother, who refused to recognise him out of shame and anger that Gwydion should have nurtured the boy, and placed a &quot;tynged&quot; on him that he should have no name unless she gave it to him. To trick her into naming him, Gwydion disguised himself and the boy as shoemakers and as they were making shoes for her, the boy threw a stone at a bird and killed it. Arianrhod declared &quot;The fair one struck with a deft hand&quot;, and thus he was named Lleu Llaw Gyffes, &quot;Fair-Haired One of the Skillful Hand&quot;.

His trick revealed, Arianrhod placed a &quot;tynged&quot; on the boy again that he would not take up arms until she gave them to him. Time passed and Lleu grew big and strong. Again, Gwydion disguised his nephew and himself, this time as bards, and like he did to King Pryderi, entertained Arianrhod&#x27;s court with stories. In the morning, Gwydion deceived Arianrhod to believe that her estate was under attack. When she asked for his advice, he bade her gird a sword on Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who he said was a skilful fighter. No sooner had she done so than Gwydion revealed the truth.

Furious at being tricked again, Arianrhod placed a &quot;tynged&quot; on her son once more, that he would never have a human wife. By this time, Math had come to sympathize with Gwydion. Together, they created a woman from the flowers of the oak, broom and meadowsweet and brought her to life, giving her the name Blodeuwedd &quot;Flower-Faced&quot;.

===Lleu and Blodeuwedd===
One day, when Lleu was away from home visiting Math, Blodeuwedd saw a nobleman, named Gronw Pebr, passing and invited him to stay (for it would be rude not do so). They fell in love and concocted a plot to kill Lleu. Blodeuwedd elicited from Lleu how he could be killed — with one foot on the back of a goat and the other on the rim of a bath of water, underneath a canopy, using a spear that had been made over the course of a year only on Sundays whilst the people were at Mass. She told this to Gronw and he set out to make the spear.

A year later, she persuaded Lleu to demonstrate this odd position where he might be killed. Suspecting nothing, he did so. Gronw, who had been waiting in ambush, threw the spear he had made at him. However, rather than dying outright Lleu turned into an eagle and flew away wounded. Gronw then took Blodeuedd and Lleu&#x27;s land. Gwydion went searching for his nephew and, by following a pig, found him (still an eagle) in a very bad state at the top of an oak tree by a lake. He called him down from the tree with three stanzas of poetry called the englynion Gwydion, transformed him back into a man and with Math nursed him back to health. Then Lleu sought revenge on Gronw and his wife.

Blodeuedd heard of this and fled, taking her maidens with her, but they were so frightened, that they ended up walking backwards to make sure nobody attacked them from behind. Unfortunately, they ended up falling into a lake (Llyn y Morwynion on the moors above Ffestiniog), with only Blodeuedd surviving. Gwydion captured her and instead of killing her, turned her into an owl and cursed her with this form permanently through giving her the name Blodeuwedd (&quot;Flower-Face&quot;), reflecting the owl&#x27;s appearance.
Gronw offered Lleu land or money as payment, but Lleu would only accept one resolution: that he throw a spear at Gronw in the same way that he had been attacked. Gronw accepted, but asked that a large stone be placed between him and Lleu. Nevertheless, Lleu threw the spear right through the stone and killed Gronw. After this he took back his lands and later succeeded Math as king of Gwynedd.

==Etymology==

The name Math is thought to derive from the Proto-Celtic &quot;*matu-&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot; or &quot;fortunate&quot; but also being a euphemism for a bear.

<text>Arianrhod () is a figure in Welsh mythology who plays her most important role in the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;. She is the daughter of Dôn and the sister of Gwydion and Gilfaethwy; the Welsh Triads give her father as Beli Mawr. In the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; her uncle Math ap Mathonwy is the King of Gwynedd, and during the course of the story she gives birth to two sons, Dylan ail Don and Lleu Llaw Gyffes, through magical means.

==Mabinogion==
According to the Fourth Branch (circa 12th century), Arianrhod&#x27;s uncle Math fab Mathonwy would die if he didn&#x27;t keep his feet in the lap of a virgin when he was not at war. Gilfaethwy develops a lust for Math&#x27;s original footholder, pretty Goewin, and he and his brother Gwydion engineer a war with King Pryderi of Kingdom of Dyfed, forcing Math to leave his court. In Math&#x27;s absence, Gilfaethwy rapes Goewin. When Math returns, he punishes his nephews severely by turning them into a series of mated pairs of animals and marries Goewin to alleviate her shame. However, he must find a new virgin to hold his feet.

Gwydion suggests his sister, Arianrhod. To test her virginity, Math tells her to step over his magician&#x27;s rod. On doing this, however, she immediately gives birth to a young boy, Dylan ail Don, and a blob-like entity which becomes Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Dylan is a sea spirit, who flees to the ocean immediately after he is baptized. Gwydion grabs Lleu Llaw Gyffes before anyone else sees it and places it in a chest. Before long, it becomes a boy who grows at twice the normal rate; when he is four, he is as big as an eight-year-old. Gwydion takes him to see his mother at her home, Caer Arianrhod.

However, Arianrhod was angry about her humiliation at Math&#x27;s court. She places a &quot;tynged&quot; (a &quot;geis&quot; or taboo) on the boy that he will never have a name unless she gives it to him. Gwydion disguises the boy as a shoemaker and returns to Caer Arianrhod; while Arianrhod is being fitted, she sees the boy killing a wren with a single stone and remarks that the fair-haired one (&quot;lleu&quot;) has a skillful hand (&quot;llaw gyffes&quot;). Gwydion reveals the disguise, and says she has just given her son a name – Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Arianrhod then places a second &quot;tynged&quot; on Lleu, that he would never take arms unless she armed him. A few years later, Gwydion and Lleu return to Caer Arianrhod, this time disguised as bards. Gwydion is an accomplished storyteller and entertains her court. That night, while everyone sleeps, he conjures a fleet of warships. Arianrhod gives her guests weapons and armor to help her fight, thereby dispelling her second curse. When Gwydion reveals the trickery, Arianrhod places a final &quot;tynged&quot; on Lleu: he would never have a wife from any race that is on this earth now. Gwydion and Math eventually break this curse by creating a woman out of oak blossom, broom, and meadowsweet; she is named Blodeuwedd (&quot;flower face&quot;). 

With her curses, Arianrhod denied Lleu the three aspects of masculinity: a name, arms, and a wife.

==In other sources==
One of the Welsh Triads, 35 by Rachel Bromwich&#x27;s numbering, establishes a different family connection for Arianrhod. Her father is named as Beli Mawr, and her brother is Caswallawn (the historical Cassivellaunus). She has two sons by Lliaws son of Nwyfre, Gwenwynwyn and Gwanar, who both accompany Caswallawn in his pursuit of Julius Caesar after he has been chased from Britain. This triad is the only source connecting Arianrhod to Beli Mawr and the Caswallawn saga, but it is not incompatible with the tradition recorded in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. 

The stories of Welsh mythology changed over time, and the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; does not contain the only version of them. Welsh scholar William John Gruffydd noted that 15th- and 16th-century poets apparently knew an alternate tradition in which Arianrhod actually became Math&#x27;s footholder. Additionally, some scholars have suggested that in an earlier form of the Fourth Branch, Gwydion was the father of Arianrhod&#x27;s sons.

Arianrhod&#x27;s palace, Caer Arianrhod, is connected with a rock formation visible westward of Llandwrog, North-West Wales at low tide. This formation is one of several landmarks that attest to the localization of the events in the Fourth Branch in this area. The name &quot;Caer Arianrhod&quot; is also used in Welsh for the constellation Corona Borealis. Robert Graves cites the riddling claim of Taliesin to have spent three periods in the prison/castle of Arianrhod, who Graves considers as &quot;one more aspect of Caridwen, or Ceridwen, the White Goddess...the Muse-goddess&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Arianrhod&quot; (from the Welsh &quot;arian&quot;, &quot;silver,&quot; and &quot;rhod&quot;, &quot;wheel&quot;) may be cognate with Proto-Celtic *&quot;Arganto-rotā&quot;, meaning &quot;silver wheel.&quot; Alternatively, the earliest form of the name may have been &quot;Aranrot&quot;, in which case the first part of the name would be related to &quot;Aran,&quot; a word with uncertain meaning, &quot;but &#x27;huge&#x27;, &#x27;round&#x27; or &#x27;humped&#x27; would all be possible interpretations.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*The term &#x27;Arianrhod&#x27; is used in two different fantasy TV series during 2012. On both occasions it is a term connected to mind control.
**In the fourth series of &quot;Young Dracula&quot;, the mind-controlling Rings of Arianrhod are used by Ramanga (Robbie Gee) as part of a plan to kill Vlad Dracula (Gerran Howell) on his wedding day, though the scheme is thwarted by Bertrand De Fortunessa (Cesari Taurasi). Adze Ramanga (Nathasha Stokes) uses the Rings to control Erin Noble (Sydney Rae White) and force her to stand on the roof of Garside Grange School, before striking her with a fireball, causing her to fall. The blast embeds fragments of the Ring in Erin&#x27;s chest, and they remain there after Vlad turns her into a vampire. The other Ring is used by Count Dracula (Keith-Lee Castle) and Malik Vaccaria (Richard Southgate) to track Ramanga down.
**In the fifth series of &quot;Merlin&quot;, Merlin (Colin Morgan) uses the Pool of Arianrhod to undo the brainwashing of Guinevere Pendragon (Angel Coulby) by Morgana Pendragon (Katie McGrath).
* In Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Arianrhod is the name of a city in the Kingdom of Faerghus. The city is destroyed as an act of vengeance for killing an important leader from Those Who Slither in the Dark.
* In The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure and The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III, one of the major antagonists is named Arianrhod.
* In The Wheel of Time, the dream-world Tel&#x27;Aran&#x27;Rhiod was named after Arianrhod.

<doc id="85959" wikidata="Q1789019" url="?curid=85959" title="Lleu Llaw Gyffes">
<text>Lleu Llaw Gyffes (), sometimes incorrectly spelled as Llew Llaw Gyffes, is a hero of Welsh mythology. He appears most prominently in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi, the tale of Math fab Mathonwy, which tells the tale of his birth, his marriage, his death, his resurrection and his accession to the throne of Gwynedd. He is a warrior and magician, invariably associated with his uncle Gwydion.

He is widely understood to be the Welsh equivalent of the Irish Lugh and the Gaulish Lugus. It has been suggested that Lleu, like Pryderi, is related to the divine son figure of Mabon ap Modron.

==Name==

The name &quot;Lleu&quot; is derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;Lugus&quot;, the exact meaning (and etymology) of which is still a matter of scholarly debate.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
The story of Lleu and the &quot;tynghedau&quot; of Arianrhod and then of Lleu and Blodeuwedd form respectively the second and third part of the Mabinogi of Math fab Mathonwy.

===Birth===
Gilfaethwy, nephew to the Venedotian king, Math fab Mathonwy, falls in love with his uncle&#x27;s virgin foot-holder, Goewin. His brother Gwydion conspires to start a war between the north and the south, so as give the brothers the opportunity to rape Goewin while Math is distracted by the ensuing war. To this end, Gwydion steals a number of otherworldly pigs from the Demetian king, Pryderi, leading to an invasion of Gwynedd.

Pryderi and his men march north and fight a battle between Maenor Bennardd and Maenor Coed Alun, but are forced to retreat. He is pursued to Nant Call, where more of his men are slaughtered, and then to Dol Benmaen, where he suffers a third defeat. To avoid further bloodshed, it is agreed that the outcome of the battle should be decided by single combat between Gwydion and Pryderi. The two contenders meet at a place called &quot;Y Velen Rhyd&quot; in Ardudwy, and &quot;because of strength and valour and magic and enchantment&quot;, Gwydion triumphs and Pryderi is killed. The men of Dyfed retreat back to their own land, lamenting over the death of their lord.

When Math hears of the assault on Goewin, he turns his nephews into a series of mated pairs of animals: Gwydion becomes a stag for a year, then a sow and finally a wolf. Gilfaethwy becomes a hind deer, a boar and a she-wolf. Each year they produce an offspring which is sent to Math: Hyddwn, Hychddwn and Bleiddwn. After three years, Math releases his nephews from their punishment and begins the search for a new foot-holder. Gwydion suggests his sister Arianrhod, who is magically tested for virginity by Math. During the test, she gives birth to a &quot;sturdy boy with thick yellow hair&quot; whom Math names Dylan and who takes on the nature of the seas until his death at his uncle Gofannon&#x27;s hands.

Ashamed, Arianrhod runs to the door, but on her way out something small drops from her, which Gwydion wraps up and places in a chest at the foot of his bed. Some time later, he hears screams from within the chest, and opens it to discover a second baby boy.

===Lleu and the &quot;tynghedau&quot; of Arianrhod===
Some years later, Gwydion accompanies the boy to Caer Arianrhod, and presents him to his mother. The furious Arianrhod, shamed by this reminder of her loss of virginity, places a &quot;tynged&quot; on the boy: that only she could give him a name. Gwydion, however, tricks his sister by disguising himself and the boy as cobblers and luring Arianrhod into going to them in person in order to have some shoes made for her. The boy uses an unspecified missile to strike a wren &quot;between the tendon and the bone of its leg&quot;, causing Arianrhod to make the remark &quot;it is with a skillful hand that the fair-haired one has hit it&quot;. At that Gwydion reveals himself, saying ; the fair-haired one with the skillful hand&#x27; is his name now&quot;. Furious at this trickery, Arianrhod places another &quot;tynged&quot; on Lleu: he shall receive arms from no one but Arianrhod herself. Gwydion tricks his sister once again, and she unwittingly arms Lleu herself, leading to her placing a third &quot;tynged&quot; on him: that he shall never have a human wife.

So as to counteract Arianrhod&#x27;s curse, Math and Gwydion:

===Lleu and Blodeuwedd===

Blodeuwedd has an affair with Gronw Pebr, the lord of Penllyn, and the two conspire to murder Lleu. Blodeuwedd tricks Lleu into revealing how he may be killed, since he cannot be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made. He reveals to her that he can only be killed at dusk, wrapped in a net with one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat and with a spear forged for a year during the hours when everyone is at mass. With this information she arranges his death.

Struck by the spear thrown by Gronw&#x27;s hand, Lleu transforms into an eagle and flies away. Gwydion tracks him down and finds him perched high on an oak. Through the singing of &quot;englynion&quot;, the &quot;englynion Gwydion&quot;, he lures him down from the oak tree and switches him back to his human form. Gwydion and Math nurse Lleu back to health before reclaiming his lands from Gronw and Blodeuwedd. In the face-off between Lleu and Gronw, Gronw asks if he may place a large stone between himself and Lleu&#x27;s spear. Lleu allows him to do so, then throws his spear, which pierces both the stone and Gronw, killing him. Gwydion corners Blodeuwedd and turns her into an owl. The tale ends with Lleu acceding to the throne of Gwynedd.

===Other appearances===
In the 10th century, Old Welsh &quot;Harleian&quot; genealogies (Harley MS 3859), mention is made of Lou Hen (&quot;Lou the old&quot;) map Guidgen, who most scholars identify with Lleu and Gwydion (who is implied to be Lleu&#x27;s father in the Mabinogi of Math, though this relationship is not explicitly stated). In the genealogy they are made direct descendants Caratauc son of Cinbelin son of Teuhant (&quot;recte Tehuant&quot;), who are to be identified with the historical Catuvellaunian leaders Caratacus, Cunobeline and Tasciovanus.

A number of references to Lleu can be found in early Welsh poetry. According to the &quot;Book of Taliesin&quot;, he fought alongside Gwydion at the Battle of the Trees, in which he assisted his uncle in enchanting the trees to rise up in battle against Arawn, king of Annwn. The poem &quot;Prif Gyuarch Taliessin&quot; asks &quot;Lleu and Gwydion / Will they perform magics?&quot;, while in the same corpus, The poem &quot;Kadeir Taliesin&quot; refers to the &quot;golden pipes of Lleu&quot;.

Lleu&#x27;s death is alluded to a number of times in medieval texts. In the Stanzas of the Graves, it is claimed that Lleu&#x27;s grave lies &quot;under the protection of the sea&quot;. A variant of the last two lines of the stanza is found in the &quot;Beddau&quot; in Peniarth 98: &quot;before his doom came, he was a man who invited attack.&quot; The poem &quot;Kateir Kerrituen&quot; (&quot;Song of Cerridwen&quot;) states that he fell at Arllechwedd, whilst also giving him a son, Minawg fab Lleu. A variant translation suggests conversely that it was Minawg who was killed, at the &quot;slope of Lleu&quot;.

The Triads of the Horses name his horse as &quot;Melyngan Mangre&quot; (&quot;Yellow-white Stud-horse&quot;), one of the three bestowed horses, and the Hergest Triads refer to Lleu himself as one of the three &quot;Red Ravagers of the Island of Britain&quot; as well as one of the three &quot;Golden Shoemakers&quot;. A reference to Lleu is also made in the &quot;Dialogue of Taliesin and Ugnach&quot;, a dialogue-poem found in the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot;. Within the narrative, the character of Taliesin states:

<doc id="85960" wikidata="Q45148466" url="?curid=85960" title="Blodeuwedd">
<text>Blodeuwedd (; Welsh &quot;Flower-Faced&quot;, a composite name from &quot;blodau&quot; &quot;flowers&quot; + &quot;gwedd&quot; &quot;face&quot;), is married to Lleu Llaw Gyffes in Welsh mythology. She was made from the flowers of broom, meadowsweet and oak by the magicians Math and Gwydion, and is a central figure in &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;, the last of the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
The hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes has been placed under a &quot;tynged&quot; (&quot;doom&quot;) by his mother, Arianrhod, that he may never have a human wife. To counteract this curse, the magicians Math and Gwydion:

Some time later, while Lleu is away on business, Blodeuwedd has an affair with Gronw Pebr, the lord of Penllyn, and the two lovers conspire to murder Lleu. Blodeuwedd tricks Lleu into revealing how he may be killed, since he cannot be killed during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made. He reveals to her that he can only be killed at dusk, wrapped in a net, with one foot on a bath and one on a black goat, by a riverbank and by a spear forged for a year during the hours when everyone is at Mass. With this information she arranges his death.
Struck by the spear thrown by Gronw&#x27;s hand, Lleu transforms into an eagle and flies away. Gwydion tracks him down and finds him perched high on an oak tree. Through the singing of an englyn (known as englynion Gwydion) Gwydion lures Lleu down from the oak tree and switches him back to his human form. Gwydion and Math nurse Lleu back to health before mustering Gwynedd and reclaiming his lands from Gronw and Blodeuwedd.

Gwydion overtakes the fleeing Blodeuwedd and turns her into an owl (in Welsh &quot;tylluan&quot; or &quot;gwdihŵ&quot;), the creature hated by all other birds, proclaiming:

The narrative adds:

Meanwhile, Gronw escapes to Penllyn and sends emissaries to Lleu, to beg his forgiveness. Lleu refuses, demanding that Gronw must stand on the bank of the River Cynfael and receive a blow from his spear. Gronw desperately asks if anyone from his warband will take the spear in his place, but his men refuse his plea. Eventually, Gronw agrees to receive the blow on the condition that he may place a large stone between himself and Lleu. Lleu allows Gronw to do so, then throws the spear with such strength that it pierces the stone, killing his rival. A holed stone in Ardudwy is still known as &quot;Llech Ronw&quot; (Gronw&#x27;s Stone).

Robert Graves and others consider lines 142–153 of &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; to be a &quot;Song of Blodeuwedd&quot;.

==In literature==
*Alan Garner&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Owl Service&quot; (1967), makes the story of Blodeuwedd an eternal cycle played out each generation, in a Welsh valley. The only way to break the cycle is for the Blodeuwedd character to realise she is supposed to be flowers, not an owl.

*Louise M. Hewett explores the story of Blodeuwedd and Math Son of Mathonwy from a feminist perspective in the second and third books, &quot;Wind&quot; (2017) ( ); and &quot;Flowers&quot; (2017) ( ), of her novel series, &quot;Pictish Spirit&quot;. Within the novels, a discussion about the three significant females in the story of Math Son of Mathonwy – Goewin, Arianrhod and Blodeuwedd – has taken place between Róisín and a group of the Pictish Spirit Braves. It culminates with Róisín&#x27;s &quot;re-vision&quot; of the story in the closing chapter of &quot;Flowers&quot;, pages 810–814.

*Blodeuwedd&#x27;s creation by Gwydion and Math is delicately described in the poem &quot;The Wife of Llew&quot; by Francis Ledwidge.

*The Blodeuwedd story is referenced in the novel and film &quot;Tylluan Wen&quot;.

*In John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; (1951), where the adulterous Blodeuwedd &quot;is released from her prison of beak and feathers&quot; by the magic of King Arthur&#x27;s magician Myrddin (Merlin).

*John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; (1954) mentions Blodeuwedd&#x27;s story briefly. Doc tells Suzy of the story, as he looks at the wild iris in her hand, while they&#x27;re on their arranged date.

<text>Gronw Pebr () &quot;Gronw the Radiant&quot; is a warrior, hunter and antagonist in Welsh tradition, appearing primarily in the fourth branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; as the lord of Penllyn, the lover of Blodeuwedd and the murderer of Lleu Llaw Gyffes. He is also mentioned in the Welsh Triads and in the medieval poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot;.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
Lleu Llaw Gyffes has been placed under a tynged that he would never gain a wife of human birth. His uncle, the trickster and magician Gwydion joins forces with the Venedotian king Math fab Mathonwy to create a woman for Lleu, out of the flowers of oak, broom and meadowsweet, naming her Blodeuwedd. One day, while Lleu is away on business, Gronw Pebr, lord of Penllyn, comes across Lleu&#x27;s stronghold whilst out hunting and falls in love with Blodeuwedd. They conspire to kill Lleu so that they can be together.

Lleu can only be killed if certain conditions are met, and Blodeuwedd tricks him into revealing what these conditions are. He can not be killed indoors or outdoors, on horseback or on foot. Consequently, he can only be killed whilst he has one foot on a cauldron and one on a goat (the cauldron being placed on a stream bank but under a roof) and by someone using a spear forged over a year and only when people are attending mass.

Blodeuwedd coaxes the secret from Lleu and a year later, Gronw ambushes the prince. He flings the spear at Lleu, who disappears in the form of an eagle. Gronw and Blodeuwedd now assume power, but on hearing the news of his nephew Gwydion sets out to find and cure him. He finds Lleu in the form of a wounded eagle perched in an oak tree and restores him to human form.

Together they overcome Gronw, and make him stand in the same position that Lleu occupied when Gronw flung the spear at him. Gronw is allowed to hold a stone as a shield, but Lleu throws the spear so hard that it penetrates the stone and kills Gronw. Gwydion curses Blodeuwedd, turning her into an owl.

<text>Gofannon () is a Middle Welsh reflex of Gobannus, one of the deities worshipped by the ancient Celts. He features in Middle Welsh literature as a great metal worker and as the son of Dôn. His name can be compared with the Old Irish &quot;gobae&quot; (gen. &quot;gobann&quot;) ‘smith’, Middle Welsh / Cornish / Breton &quot;gof&quot; (pl. &quot;gofein&quot;) ‘smith’, Gaulish &quot;gobedbi&quot; ‘with the smiths’, all of which are cognate with Lithuanian &quot;gabija&quot; ‘sacred home fire’, &quot;gabus&quot; ‘gifted, clever’. His apparent counterpart in Irish mythology, Goibniu, in addition to his duties as a smith, also takes on the role of a divine hero who brewed an ale of immortality, in addition to being an architect and builder.

In Welsh mythology, Gofannon killed his nephew, Dylan Ail Don, not knowing who he was. One of the tasks given to Culhwch if he were to win the hand of Olwen was to get Gofannon to sharpen his brother Amaethon&#x27;s plough.

Rankine and d&#x27;Este (2007), examining &quot;Talieisin&#x27;s First Address&quot; from the Red Book of Hergest, also allude to Gofannon being a magician, with the &quot;First Address&quot; stating:

<text>In Irish mythology, Goibniu (; ) was the metalsmith of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He is believed to have been a smithing god and is also associated with hospitality. His name is related to the Welsh Gofannon and the Gaulish Gobannus.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Goibniu&quot; stems from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as *&quot;Gobeniū&quot; or *&quot;Gobanniō&quot;, which is derived from the stem *&quot;goben&quot;-, meaning &#x27;smith&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;gobae&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;gof,&quot; Middle Breton &quot;gof(f)&quot;, Old Cornish &quot;gof&quot; &#x27;smith&#x27;; cf. also Gaulish &quot;gobedbi&quot; &#x27;with the smiths&#x27; &lt; *&quot;goben-bi&quot; or *&quot;gob-et&quot;-&quot;bi-&quot;). The same stem can be found in the Gaulish deity &quot;Deo Cobanno&quot; (&lt; *&quot;Gobannos&quot;), and in &quot;Govannon&quot; (&lt; *&quot;Gobannonos&quot;), the son of the goddess Dôn in Welsh mythology, which may suggest a common origin of the name in Proto-Celtic legends. It is also attested in various personal names, such as the Gaulish &quot;Gobannitio&quot;, &quot;Gobannicnus&quot;, or &quot;Gobano&quot;, the Old Irish &quot;Gobain&quot; (Lat. &quot;Gobanus&quot;), the Old Breton &quot;Ran Gof&quot;, as well as in the toponyms &quot;Gobannium&quot; (now Abergavenny) and &quot;Sanctus Gobanus&quot; (Saint-Gobain).&quot;&quot;

A Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin of the stem *&quot;goben&quot;- is controversial, and some scholars have proposed that it is restricted to Celtic. It could be connected to Latin &quot;faber&quot; (&#x27;craftsman&#x27;), via PIE *&quot;g(w)hobh&quot;-, although the former is generally derived from *&quot;dhHbh-ro-&quot; (cf. Armenian &quot;darbin&quot;). Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel has also proposed to derive it from PIE *&quot;g(h)eubh&quot;- (&#x27;curve, bend&#x27;), because bronze was melted and hamered, contrary to iron that was hamered and bended, and Václav Blažek has suggested a relation with the Lithuanian goddess of fire &quot;Gabija&quot;.&quot;&quot;

==Family==
The name of his father appears as Esarg or Tuirbe Trágmar, the &#x27;thrower of axes&#x27;. Goibniu is often grouped together with Credne the silversmith and Luchta the carpenter as the &quot;Trí Dée Dána&quot; (three gods of art), who forged the weapons which the Tuath Dé used to battle the Fomorians. Alternatively, he is grouped with Credne and Dian Cecht the physician. He is explicitly named as the brother of Dian Cécht and Nuada in the Second Battle of Moytura (Mag Tuired) Goibniu&#x27;s unnamed wife was said to be buried in a cave at Drogheda.

== Mythology ==
When Nuada&#x27;s arm is cut off in battle, Goibniu crafts him a new one of silver, thus he is known as Nuada Airgetlám &quot;Nuada of the Silver Arm&quot;. He also makes weapons for the gods. In the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, he is described as &quot;not impotent in smelting&quot;, and is said to have died, along with Dian Cecht, of a &quot;painful plague&quot;. During the Second Battle of Moytura, Goibniu is speared by Brígh&#x27;s son Ruadán, but he removes the spear and kills Ruadán with it.

Goibniu also acts as a hospitaller who furnishes feasts for the gods. According to the &quot;Acallam na Senórach and Altram Tige Dá Medar&quot;, the feast of Goibniu was bestowed on the warriors of the Tuatha Dé by Manannán to protect them from sickness and decay. He is said to be the owner of the Glas Gaibhnenn, the magical cow of abundance and in surviving folklore also has a magical bridle for the cow.

In the St Gall incantations, Goibniu is invoked against thorns (either literal or metaphorical):

Nothing is higher than heaven, nothing is deeper than the sea. By the holy words that Christ spake from His Cross remove from me the thorn, a thorn... very sharp is Goibniu’s science, let Goibniu’s goad go out before Goibniu’s goad!

This charm is laid in butter which goes not into water and (some) of it is smeared all round the thorn and it (the butter) goes not on the point nor on the wound, and if the thorn be not there one of the two teeth in the front of his head will fall out.

Goibniu may be the same figure as Culann.

==Folklore==
In the folklore of Ireland, there are several figures variously named Gavida and Gavigan who play a role in the birth of Lugh. These figures are identified as smiths and own a fabulous cow, the Glas Gaibhnenn. In the story featuring Gavigan, the cow here called Glas Gavigan, is taken by Balor and only returned after Gavigan makes trees grow on Tory Island. In this tale, Gavigan is introduced to Balor&#x27;s daughter and becomes the father of Lugh. In another version of the story, Gavida is named as a smith and a brother of Mac Kineely and Mac Samthainn; in this version, Mac Kineely owns the famous cow whom Balor steals and later becomes the father of Lugh.

Gaibhlen is another figure identified as the smith of the Tuatha De, who owned a gigantic cow. His furnace was located at &quot;Doire-na-tuan&quot; where he melted the ore of the iron mountain &quot;Sliabh an Iarainn&quot;. There has been a forge at that location ever since.

<text>Rhodri ap Merfyn, commonly known as , was a Welsh king whose legacy has impacted the history of Wales. Rhodri rose to power during a tumultuous era, where the fate of Welsh kingdoms was often determined by the power of their leaders.

== Early life ==
Rhodri was born in the 9th century on the Isle of Man. Rhodri was the son of Merfyn, who, under enigmatic circumstances, assumed the kingship of Gwynedd following the death of Hywel ap Caradog in 825. Rhodri ascended to the throne of Gwynedd and following the passing of his father, Merfyn, in the year 844.

== Reign ==
Rhodri&#x27;s reign unfolded against a tumultuous backdrop, as Wales confronted escalating Viking incursions. Among Rhodri&#x27;s earliest recorded achievements was his defeat and killing of Gorm, a Danish chieftain, in a battle on Anglesey in 856. This victory garnered international acclaim, reaching the ears of Charles the Bald whose realm Gorm had previously harried.

In that same year, Rhodri finalized his subjugation of Powys following the death of its exiled ruler Cyngen in Rome. In 871, Rhodri expanded his dominion further, into Ceredigion following the death of its King Gwgon.

During the year 873, Rhodri won two more successes against the Vikings by securing victories in the battles of Banolau and Ynegydd on Anglesey.

In 877, a Danish force, aided by their client king Ceolwulf, assailed Anglesey, intent on avenging Gorm&#x27;s death and securing communication routes with Dublin. They succeeded in defeating Rhodri in the Battle of Sunday and seizing Anglesey, compelling him into exile on Ireland. The subsequent year marked Rhodri&#x27;s return from Irish exile, winning a battle against the Vikings to retake Anglesey. However, Rhodri and his son Gwriad later perished in a battle against the Anglo-Saxons of Mercia under King Ceolwulf II.

== Succession ==
Rhodri&#x27;s realm remained unified upon his demise, passing to his eldest son Anarawd. However, during Rhodri&#x27;s exile, Ceredigion was conquered by Hyfaidd ap Bleddri, the King of Dyfed. Subsequently, Anarawd and Rhodri&#x27;s other sons managed to reclaim Ceredigion and eventually extended their rule to the rest of Dyfed. This expansion established a distinct branch within the Merfynion dynasty, with Rhodri&#x27;s second eldest son, Cadell, at its helm.

<text>Anu or Ana (sometimes given as Anann or [[The Morrígan|Anand]]) is the name of a goddess mentioned briefly in Irish mythology.

==Myths and sources==
The 9th century &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; (Cormac&#x27;s Glossary) says in its entry for her:
: &quot;Ana – mother of the gods of Ireland; well did she feed the gods&quot;.
She may be a goddess in her own right, or an alternate name for Danu. In the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, Anand is given as another name for The Morrígan. As her name is often conflated with a number of other goddesses, it is not always clear which figure is being referred to if the name is taken out of context. The name may be derived from the Proto-Celtic *&quot;Φanon-&quot;.

Anu has particular associations with Munster: the pair of breast shaped hills known as the Paps of Anu (&quot;Dá Chích Anann&quot; or &quot;the breasts of Anu&quot;) in County Kerry are said to have been named after her.

Her name has the meaning of &quot;wealth, riches, and prosperity.&quot; Leaving her with a title of being the goddess of &quot;good fortune and prosperity&quot; in the land of Munster. 

While an Irish goddess, in Scotland (Alba) a similar figure is referred to as “Gentle Annie”, in an effort to avoid offence, a tactic which is similar to referring to the fairies as “The Good People”.

<doc id="85973" wikidata="Q798840" url="?curid=85973" title="Badb">
<text>In Irish mythology, the Badb (Old Irish, ), or in modern Irish Badhbh (, )—also meaning &quot;crow&quot;—is a war goddess who takes the form of a crow, and is thus sometimes known as Badb Catha (&quot;battle crow&quot;). She is known to cause fear and confusion among soldiers to move the tide of battle to her favoured side. Badb may also appear prior to a battle to foreshadow the extent of the carnage to come, or to predict the death of a notable person. She would sometimes do this through wailing cries, leading to comparisons with the bean-sídhe (banshee).

With her sisters, Macha and the Morrigan or Anand, Badb is part of a trio of war goddesses known as &quot;the three Morrígna&quot;.

==Representations in legends==
In Irish legends, Badb is associated with war and death, appearing either to foreshadow imminent bloodshed or to participate in battles, where she creates confusion among the soldiers. As a harbinger of doom, she appears in a number of different guises. In &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot;, she takes the form of an ugly hag who prophesies Conaire Mór&#x27;s downfall. She appears in a similar guise in &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Choca&quot; to foretell the slaying of Cormac Condloinges, as well as taking the form of a &quot;washer at the ford&quot;—a woman washing Cormac&#x27;s chariot and harness in a ford in what was considered an omen of death. The cries of Badb may also be an ill omen: Cormac&#x27;s impending death is foreshadowed with the words &quot;The red-mouthed badbs will cry around the house, / For bodies they will be solicitous&quot; and &quot;Pale badbs shall shriek&quot;. In this role she has much in common with the bean-sídhe.

She was also regularly depicted as an active participant in warfare; indeed, the battlefield was sometimes referred to as &quot;the garden of the Badb&quot;. During the First Battle of Mag Tuired, Badb—along with her sisters, Macha and Morrígan—fights on the side of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Using their magic, the three sisters incite fear and confusion among the Fir Bolg army, conjuring &quot;compact clouds of mist and a furious rain of fire&quot; and allowing their enemies &quot;neither rest nor stay for three days and nights&quot;. Badb plays a similar role in the Táin Bó Cúailnge, terrorising and disorienting the forces of Queen Medb and causing many to fall on their own weapons. She would often take the form of a screaming raven or crow, striking fear into those who heard her, and could also be heard as a voice among the corpses on a battlefield.

Following the defeat of the Fomorians by the Tuatha Dé Danann in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, Badb (or the Morrígan daughter of Ernmas) instead of predicting doom, now sings a prophecy celebrating the victory and a time of peace, 

Then she delivers a prophecy of the eventual end of the world, &quot;foretelling every evil that would be therein, and every disease and every vengeance. Wherefore then she sang this lay below.&quot;:

==Kinship==
Badb is often identified as one of the Morrígna, a trio of Irish war goddesses, although there exist a number of conflicting accounts on this subject. In &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, Badb, Macha and Morrígan make up the Morrígna trinity and are named as daughters of the farming goddess Ernmas. According to this version, she is also the sister of Ériu, Banba and Fódla, the three matron goddesses of Ireland, who give their names to the land. Other accounts identify the trio as daughters of the druid Cailitin and his wife.

&quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; also states that Badb is one of the two wives of the war god Neit. Less commonly, she has been described as the wife of the Fomorian king Tethra.

===Similar deities===
In her role as a terrifying battlefield goddess and harbinger of doom, Badb closely resembles Nemain. Like Badb, Nemain is identified as a wife of Neit. Writers have sometimes used their names interchangeably, suggesting that they may in fact be a single goddess. On the other hand, W. M. Hennessy notes that Badb and Nemain were said to have different sets of parents, suggesting that they may not be entirely identical figures.

Badb also appears to be closely related to the Gaulish goddess Catubodua, or Bodua.

==Etymology==
Pointing to variants such as Irish &quot;badhbh&quot; &#x27;hoodie crow, a fairy, a scold,&#x27; Early Irish &quot;badb&quot;, &#x27;crow, demon,&#x27; &quot;Badba&quot;, Welsh &quot;bod&quot;, &#x27;kite,&#x27; the Gaulish name &quot;Bodv&quot;-, in &quot;Bodvo-gnatus&quot; and the Welsh name &quot;Bodnod&quot;, Macbain (1982) suggests *&quot;bodwā&quot;- as the Proto-Celtic ancestral form. However, Julius Pokorny (1959:203) suggests *&quot;badwā&quot;- on the basis of similar data. Both MacBain (1982) and Julius Pokorny (1959:203) correlate the element with Norse &quot;böð&quot;, genitive &quot;boðvar&quot;, &#x27;war,&#x27; and Anglo-Saxon &quot;beadu&quot;, genitive &quot;beadwe&quot;, &#x27;battle,&#x27; suggesting that the word originally denoted &#x27;battle&#x27; or &#x27;strife.&#x27; Julius Pokorny (1959:203) presents the element as an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;bhedh&quot;- &#x27;pierce, dig.&#x27; To this root Pokorny also links the Sanskrit &quot;bádhate&quot;, &#x27;oppress,&#x27; and the Lithuanian &quot;bádas&quot;, &#x27;famine&#x27;.

W. M. Hennessy argues that the word &quot;bodb&quot; or &quot;badb&quot; originally meant &quot;rage&quot;, &quot;fury&quot;, or &quot;violence&quot;, and came to mean a witch, fairy, or goddess, represented in folklore by the scald-crow, or royston-crow. Peter O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s 1819 &quot;Irish Dictionary&quot; defines the Badb as a &quot;&quot;bean-sidhe&quot;, a female fairy, phantom, or spectre, supposed to be attached to certain families, and to appear sometimes in the form of squall-crows, or royston-crows&quot; and &quot;badb-catha&quot; as &quot;&quot;Fionog&quot;, a royston-crow, a squall crow&quot;. Other entries relate to her triple nature: &quot;&quot;Macha&quot;, i. e. a royston-crow; &quot;Morrighain&quot;, i. e. the great fairy; &quot;Neamhan&quot;, i. e. &quot;Badb catha nó feannóg&quot;; a &quot;badb catha&quot;, or royston-crow.&quot;

<doc id="85977" wikidata="Q1072038" url="?curid=85977" title="Macha">
<text>Macha () was a sovereignty goddess of ancient Ireland associated with the province of Ulster, particularly the sites of Navan Fort (&quot;Eamhain Mhacha&quot;) and Armagh (&quot;Ard Mhacha&quot;), which are named after her. Several figures called Macha appear in Irish mythology and folklore, all believed to derive from the same goddess. She is said to be one of three sisters known as &#x27;the three Morrígna&#x27;. Like other sovereignty goddesses, Macha is associated with the land, fertility, kingship, war and horses.

Proinsias Mac Cana discusses three Machas: Macha, wife of Nemed; Queen Macha, wife of Cimbáeth; and Macha, wife of Crunnchu, who caused the debility of the Ulstermen. Gregory Toner discusses four, with the addition of Macha as one of the three Morrigans.

==Etymology and alias==

The name is presumably derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;makajā&quot; denoting &quot;a plain&quot; (genitive *&quot;makajās&quot; &quot;of the plain&quot;). In modern Scottish Gaelic, the etymologically related term &quot;machair&quot; refers to a fertile grassy plain that is maintained by continuous trampling and grazing of livestock.

In the Dindsenchas Macha is called &quot;Grian Banchure&quot;, the &quot;Sun of Womanfolk&quot; and is referred to as the daughter of Midir of Brí Léith.

==Macha, daughter of Partholón==
A poem in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; mentions Macha as one of the daughters of Partholón, leader of the first settlement of Ireland after the flood, although it records nothing about her.

==Macha, wife of Nemed==
Various sources record a second Macha as the wife of Nemed, leader of the second settlement of Ireland after the flood. She was the first of Nemed&#x27;s people to die in Ireland – twelve years after their arrival according to Geoffrey Keating, twelve days after their arrival according to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;. It is said that the hilltop where she was buried was named after her: &quot;Ard Mhacha&quot;, &quot;Macha&#x27;s high place&quot;. The surrounding woodland was cleared by Nemed&#x27;s folk and named &quot;Magh Mhacha&quot;, &quot;Macha&#x27;s plain&quot;.

==Macha, daughter of Ernmas==
Macha, daughter of Ernmas, of the Tuatha Dé Danann, appears in many early sources. She is often mentioned together with her sisters, &quot;Badb and Morrigu, whose name was Anand&quot;. The three (with varying names) are often considered a triple goddess associated with war. &quot;O&#x27;Mulconry&#x27;s Glossary&quot;, a thirteenth-century compilation of glosses from medieval manuscripts preserved in the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan&quot;, describes Macha as &quot;one of the three &quot;morrígna&quot;&quot; (the plural of &quot;Morrígan&quot;), and says the term &quot;Mesrad Machae&quot;, &quot;the mast of Macha&quot;, refers to &quot;the heads of men that have been slaughtered&quot;. A version of the same gloss in MS H.3.18 identifies Macha with Badb, calling the trio &quot;raven women&quot; who instigate battle. Keating explicitly calls them &quot;goddesses&quot;, but medieval Irish tradition was keen to remove all trace of pre-Christian religion. Macha is said to have been killed by Balor during the battle with the Fomorians.

==Macha Mong Ruad==
Macha Mong Ruad (&quot;red hair&quot;), daughter of Áed Rúad (&quot;red fire&quot; or &quot;fire lord&quot; – a name of the Dagda), was, according to medieval legend and historical tradition, the only queen in the List of High Kings of Ireland. Her father Áed rotated the kingship with his cousins Díthorba and Cimbáeth, seven years at a time. Áed died after his third stint as king, and when his turn came round again, Macha claimed the kingship. Díthorba and Cimbáeth refused to allow a woman to take the throne, and a battle ensued. Macha won, and Díthorba was killed. She won a second battle against Díthorba&#x27;s sons, who fled into the wilderness of Connacht. She married Cimbáeth, with whom she shared the kingship. Macha pursued Díthorba&#x27;s sons alone, disguised as a leper, and overcame each of them in turn when they tried to have sex with her, tied them up, and carried the three of them bodily to Ulster. The Ulstermen wanted to have them killed, but Macha instead enslaved them and forced them to build Emain Macha (Navan Fort near Armagh), to be the capital of the Ulaid, marking out its boundaries with her brooch (explaining the name &quot;Emain Macha&quot; as &quot;eó-muin Macha&quot; or &quot;Macha&#x27;s neck-brooch&quot;). Macha ruled together with Cimbáeth for seven years, until he died of plague at Emain Macha, and then a further fourteen years on her own, until she was killed by Rechtaid Rígderg. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; synchronises her reign to that of Ptolemy I Soter (323–283 BC). The chronology of Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates her reign to 468–461 BC, the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 661–654 BC.

Marie-Louise Sjoestedt writes of this figure: &quot;In the person of this second Macha we discover a new aspect of the local goddess, that of the warrior and dominator; and this is combined with the sexual aspect in a specific manner which reappears in other myths, the male partner or partners being dominated by the female.&quot;

==Macha, wife of Cruinniuc==
Macha, daughter of Sainrith mac Imbaith, was the wife of Cruinniuc, an Ulster farmer. Some time after the death of Cruinniuc&#x27;s first wife, Macha appears at his house. Without speaking, she begins keeping the house and acting as his wife. Soon she becomes pregnant by him. As long as they were together Cruinniuc&#x27;s wealth grew. When he leaves to attend a festival organised by the king of Ulster, she warns him that she will only stay with him so long as he does not speak of her to anyone, and he promises to say nothing. However, during a chariot race, he boasts that his wife can run faster than the king&#x27;s horses. The king orders Cruinniuc be held on pain of death unless he can make good on his claim. Although she is heavily pregnant, Macha is brought to the gathering and the king forces her to race the horses. She wins the race, but then cries out in pain as she gives birth to twins on the finish line; a boy named Fír (&quot;True&quot;) and a girl named Fial (&quot;Modest&quot;). For disrespecting and humiliating her, she curses the men of Ulster to be overcome with weakness—as weak &quot;as a woman in childbirth&quot;—at the time of their greatest need. This weakness would last for five days and the curse would last for nine generations. Thereafter, the place where Macha gave birth would be called &quot;Emain Macha&quot;, or &quot;Macha&#x27;s twins&quot;.

This tale, &quot;The Debility of the Ulstermen&quot; (&quot;Noínden Ulad&quot;) explains the meaning of the name &quot;Emain Macha&quot;, and explains why none of the Ulstermen but the semi-divine hero Cúchulainn could resist the invasion of Ulster in the &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley). It shows that Macha, as goddess of the land and sovereignty, can be vengeful if disrespected, and how the rule of a bad king leads to disaster.

This Macha is particularly associated with horses—it is perhaps significant that twin colts were born on the same day as Cúchulainn, and that one of his chariot-horses was called Liath Macha or &quot;Macha&#x27;s Grey&quot;—and she is often compared with the Welsh mythological figure Rhiannon.

==Relationships of the Machas==
Macha is named as the wife of Nemed, son of Agnoman, or alternately as the wife of Crund, son of Agnoman, which may indicate an identity of Nemed with Crund. Macha is also named as the daughter of Midir and Aed the Red.

<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Ancamna was a goddess worshipped particularly in the valley of the river Moselle. She was commemorated at Trier and Ripsdorf as the consort of Lenus Mars, and at Möhn as the consort of Mars Smertulitanus. At Trier, altars were set up in honour of Lenus Mars, Ancamna and the &quot;genii&quot; of various &quot;pagi&quot; of the Treveri, giving the impression of Lenus Mars and Ancamna as tribal protectors honoured in an officially organized cult. Among the few statuettes left as votive offerings at the sanctuary of Mars Smertulitanus and Ancamna at Möhn is one of a &quot;genius cucullatus&quot; like those offered to the Xulsigiae at the Lenus Mars temple complex in Trier.

Inciona is also apparently invoked along with Lenus Mars Veraudunus on a bronze &quot;ex voto&quot; from Luxembourg; it is unclear what connection, if any, exists between Inciona and Ancamna. Jufer and Luginbühl link Ancamna with two other consorts of the Gaulish Mars, Litavis and Nemetona, noting that none of these appear to be warrior goddesses themselves; instead, they suggest that Ancamna might have been associated with a spring. Edith Wightman considers the couple Mars Loucetius and Nemetona to be &quot;closely similar to if not identical with, Lenus and Ancamna&quot;.

<doc id="86000" wikidata="Q5527119" url="?curid=86000" title="Fortifications of Cairo">
<text>The fortifications of the historic city of Cairo, Egypt, include defensive walls and gates that were built, rebuilt, and expanded in different periods. 

The first set of walls were built during the foundation of Fatimid Cairo in the 10th century. These were rebuilt in the late 11th century on the orders of the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali. In the 12th century, the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din (Saladin) restored the walls and began a major extension to the south. He also began construction on the Citadel of Cairo, a military complex that would serve as the center of power in Egypt for centuries afterwards.

Some sections of the historic walls are still preserved today, mainly on the north and east sides of the city, as well as much of the Citadel. Only three gates are fully preserved, all dating from the late 11th-century Fatimid reconstruction: Bab al-Nasr, Bab al-Futuh, and Bab Zuwayla. Some other gates have been partially recovered through archeological excavations, such as Bab al-Barqiyya. 

== Historical development ==

=== Fatimid walls ===

Cairo was founded as a palace-city in 969 by the Fatimid Caliphate. Jawhar al-Siqilli, the Fatimid general who led the conquest of Egypt, oversaw the construction of the city&#x27;s original walls, which were built of mudbrick. According to later medieval sources, these first city walls, which had a roughly rectangular outline, had eight gates. On the north side were two gates named &quot;Bāb al-Futūḥ&quot; (&quot;Gate of Conquests&quot;) and &quot;Bāb al-Naṣr&quot; (&quot;Gate of Victory&quot;); on the east side were &quot;Bāb al-Barqiyya&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Barqa regiment&quot;) and &quot;Bāb al-Qarrātīn&quot; (&quot;Gate of the clover merchants&quot;); to the south were &quot;Bāb Zuwayla&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Zuwayla&quot;) and &quot;Bāb al-Faraj&quot; (&quot;Gate of Joy&quot;); and on the west side were &quot;Bāb al-Qanṭara&quot; (&quot;Gate of the bridge [over the Khalij canal]&quot;) and &quot;Bāb al-Sa&#x27;ada&quot; (&quot;Gate of Felicity&quot;). During the Fatimid period there were many gardens along the walls. A chain of gardens ran past Bab al-Nasr and the garden of al-Mukhtar al-Saqlabi existed outside Bab al-Futuh.

During the late 11th century, the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali ordered a reconstruction of the walls primarily out of stone and further outward than before to expand the space within Cairo&#x27;s walls. Construction began in 1087. The architectural elements of the walls were informed by Badr al-Gamali&#x27;s Armenian background, and were innovative in the context of Islamic military architecture in Egypt. The walls are composed of three vertical levels. The lower level was elevated above the street and contained the vestibules of the gates, which were accessible by ramps. The second level contained halls that connected different galleries and rooms. The third level was the terrace level, protected by parapets, where, near gates, belvederes were built for the caliph and his court to use. Although it was previously thought that the entirety of Badr al-Jamali&#x27;s walls were built in stone, more recent archeological findings have confirmed that at least part of the eastern wall was built out of mudbrick, while the gates were built in stone. The gates of the new walls retained generally the same names and were located in the same areas as those of the old walls.

=== Ayyubid walls ===

Salah ad-Din, the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, restored the Fatimid walls and gates in 1170 or 1171. He reconstructed parts of the walls, including the eastern wall. In 1176, he then embarked on a project to radically expand the city&#x27;s fortifications. This project included the construction of the Citadel of Cairo and of a 20 kilometer-long wall to connect and protect both Cairo (referring to the former royal city of the Fatimids) and Fustat (the main city and earlier capital of Egypt a short distance to the southwest). The entirety of the envisioned course of the wall was never quite completed, but long stretches of the wall were built, including the section to the north of the Citadel and a section near Fustat in south. Work continued under subsequent Ayyubid sultans.

Al-Maqrizi, a writer from the later Mamluk period, reports several details about the construction. In 1185–6, the wall around Fustat was being built. In 1192, a trench was being built for the eastern fortifications, by which time some of the eastern wall and its towers were probably in place. Work continued after Salah ad-Din&#x27;s death (1193) under his successors, al-&#x27;Adil and al-Kamil. In 1200, orders went out to dig the remaining course of the wall. More sections of the wall were completed by 1218, but by 1238 work was apparently still ongoing.

The new Ayyubid extensions also added several new gates, of which eight have been identified. The northern extension of the wall, running west from Bab al-Futuh, added two new gates in this area: &quot;Bāb al-Sharī&#x27;ah&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Law [Sharia]&quot;), located close to the Fatimid walls, and &quot;Bāb al-Baḥr&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Sea/Water&quot;), located further west and close to the Nile River. The eastern walls near Cairo (north of the Citadel) included, from north to south: &quot;Bāb al-Jadīd&quot; (&quot;New Gate&quot;), &quot;Bāb al-Barqiyya&quot;, and &quot;Bāb al-Mahrūq&quot; (&quot;Burned Gate&quot;). The new section of walls near Fustat (south of the Citadel) included, from north to south: &quot;Bāb al-Qarāfa&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Cemetery [al-Qarafa]&quot;) and &quot;Bāb al-Safā&quot;.

=== Modern restorations and excavations ===
Since 1999, the preserved northern section of Fatimid walls has been cleared of debris and part of a local urban regeneration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the rubbish hills east of the historic city were excavated and transformed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture into al-Azhar Park, which opened in 2005. Parts of the Ayyubid wall and a gate were uncovered in 1998, during this work. Further archeological work and restoration has since taken place in this area.

== Preserved gates ==
Many gates existed along the walls of Fatimid Cairo, but only three remain today: Bab al-Nasr, Bab al-Futuh, and Bab Zuwayla (with &quot;Bab&quot; translating to &quot;gate&quot;). These gates are among the most important masterpieces of historic military architecture in the Islamic world.A restoration project from 2001 to 2003 successfully restored the three gates and parts of the northern wall between Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh. 

=== Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr (northern gates) ===

Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh are both are on the northern section of the wall, about two hundred yards from each other. Bab al-Nasr, which translates to &quot;the Gate of Victory,&quot; was originally called Bab al-Izz, meaning &quot;the Gate of Glory,&quot; when constructed by Gawhar al-Siqilli. It was reconstructed by Badr al-Gamali between 1087 and 1092 about two hundred meters from the original site and was given its new name. Similarly, Bab al-Futuh was originally called Bab al-Iqbal, or &quot;the Gate of Prosperity,&quot; and was later renamed Bab al-Futuh by Badr al-Gamali. 

Bab al-Nasr is flanked by two towers of square shape, with shield insignias carved into the stone, while Bab al-Futuh is flanked by round towers. The vaulted stone ceilings inside Bab al-Nasr are innovative in design, with the helicoidal vaults being the first of their kind in this architectural context. The façade of Bab al-Nasr has a frieze containing Kufic inscriptions in white marble, including a foundation inscription and the Shi&#x27;a version of the &quot;Shahada&quot; which was representative of the Fatimid caliphate&#x27;s religious beliefs. 

Bab al-Futuh features no inscriptions on the gate itself, but an inscription can be seen nearby to the east, on the wall salient around the northern minaret of the al-Hakim Mosque. Inside Bab al-Futuh, through its eastern flanking doorway, is the tomb of an unidentified figure, and through its western flanking doorway is a long vaulted chamber.

=== Bab Zuwayla (southern gate) ===
The third surviving gate, Bab Zuwayla, sits in the southern section of the wall. Badr al-Gamali rebuilt Bab Zuwayla further south than Gawhar al-Siqilli&#x27;s original gate. The construction of the current gate is dated to 1092. Similar to Bab al-Nasr and Bab al-Futuh, Bab Zuwayla was also adjacent to gardens, namely the gardens of Qanṭara al-Kharq. The Mosque of al-Mu&#x27;ayyad Shaykh was built next to the gate between 1415 and 1420, at which time a pair of minarets were constructed on top of the two bastions that flank the gateway. 

=== Eastern gates ===
One of the eastern gates of the city, part of the Ayyubid reconstruction of the walls, was also uncovered in 1998 and subsequently studied and restored. It has a complex defensive layout including a bent entrance and a bridge over a moat or ditch. Initially identified as &quot;Bab al-Barqiyya&quot;, it is possible that it was actually known as &quot;Bab al-Jadid&quot; (&quot;New Gate&quot;), one of the three eastern gates mentioned by al-Maqrizi. If so, then the name &quot;Bab al-Barqiyya&quot; most likely corresponded to another gate a short distance to the northeast. The latter gate, originally discovered in the 1950s, dates from Badr al-Gamali&#x27;s time and, according to an inscription, was also called &quot;Bab al-Tawfiq&quot; (&quot;Gate of Success&quot;). It would have replaced the earlier 10th-century Fatimid gate in this area. Archeologists discovered a number of ancient stones with Pharaonic inscriptions that were re-used in the gate&#x27;s construction. It was likely replaced by an Ayyubid-era gate built in front of it, but as of 2008 this had not yet been excavated. 

Another gate further north, near the northeast corner of the walls, was known as &quot;Bab al-Jadid&quot; up to the present day and thus possibly contributed to confusion over the identification of the Ayyubid gate uncovered in 1998, with which it shares a similar layout.

== Citadel ==
In 1176, the construction of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin&#x27;s orders. It was to become the center of government in Egypt until the 19th century, with expansions and renovations. The Citadel was completed under sultan Al-Kamil (r. 1218–1238). All of al-Kamil&#x27;s fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin&#x27;s towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications. As the Citadel remained the center of government for Egypt for centuries, it underwent multiple renovations and expansions, notably in the Mamluk period (13th to early 16th centuries) and under the rule of Muhammad Ali Pasha.

<text>Andarta was a Celtic goddess worshiped in southern Gaul. Inscriptions invoking her name have been found among the Vocontii in Southern France, and in Bern, Switzerland.

== Name ==
The Gaulish theonym &quot;Andarta&quot; is traditionally interpreted as meaning &#x27;Great Bear&#x27;, perhaps &#x27;powerful bear&#x27; or &quot;Ursa Major&quot;, formed with an intensifying suffix &quot;and&quot;- attached to a feminine form of &quot;artos&quot; (&#x27;bear&#x27;). &quot;Andarta&quot; might thus have been a counterpart or an alternative name of the Celtic bear goddess, Artio.

According to linguist Blanca María Prósper, however, &quot;this idea is uncompelling because the semantics lack good parallels and the inner syntax of the compound is utterly problematic.&quot; In her view, the name should be translated as &#x27;Well-fixed, Staying-firm&#x27;, formed with a prefix *&quot;h₂ndʰi-&quot; (or *&quot;h₁ndo-&quot;) attached to a participle *-&quot;h₂-rtó&quot; (&#x27;fixed, composed, built&#x27;; cf. Sanskrit &quot;ṛta&quot; &#x27;cosmic law, order&#x27;, Greek &quot;artús&quot; &#x27;arrangement&#x27;, Latin &quot;artus&quot; &#x27;joint&#x27;).

<doc id="86003" wikidata="Q492983" url="?curid=86003" title="Andraste">
<text>Andraste, also known as Andrasta, was, according to the Roman historian Dio Cassius, an Icenic war goddess invoked by Boudica in her fight against the Roman occupation of Britain in AD 60. She may be the same as Andate, mentioned later by the same source, and described as &quot;their name for Victory&quot;: i.e., the goddess Victoria. Thayer asserts that she may also be related to Andarta. The goddess Victoria is related to Nike, Bellona, Magna Mater (Great Mother), Cybele, and Vacuna—goddesses who are often depicted on chariots. Her name has been translated as meaning &quot;indestructible&quot; or &quot;unconquerable&quot;.

Many neopagan sources describe the hare as sacred to Andraste. This idea seems to be extrapolated from the passage in Dio Cassius in which Boudica releases a hare from her gown:

The hare&#x27;s release is described as a technique of divination, with an augury drawn from the direction in which it runs. This appears to be similar to the Roman methods of divination which ascribe meaning to the directions from which birds fly, with the left side being unfavourable (&quot;sinistra&quot;) and the right side favourable.

<text>Anextiomarus (Gaulish: &quot;Anextlomāros&quot;, &#x27;Great Protection&#x27;) is a Celtic epithet of the sun-god Apollo recorded in a Romano-British inscription from South Shields, England. A variant form, &quot;Anextlomarus&quot;, appears as a divine style or name attested in a fragmentary Gallo-Roman dedication from Le Mans, France. Anextlomarus is also attested as a Gaulish man&#x27;s father&#x27;s name at Langres, and a feminine divine form, &quot;Anextlomara&quot;, appears in two other Gallo-Roman dedications from Avenches, Switzerland.

== Name ==
The Gaulish theonym &quot;Anextlomāros&quot; means &#x27;Great Protection&#x27;, that is to say &#x27;he who is in Great Protection&#x27;. It stems from the noun &quot;anextlo&quot;- (&#x27;protection&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;anacul&quot;) attached to &quot;māros&quot; (&#x27;great&#x27;).

<text>Interstate 4 (I-4) is an Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Florida, maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Spanning along a generally southwest–northeast axis, I-4 is entirely concurrent with State Road 400 (SR 400). In the west, I-4 begins at an interchange with I-275 in Tampa. I-4 intersects with several major expressways as it traverses Central Florida, including US Highway 41 (US 41) in Tampa; US 301 near Riverview; I-75 near Brandon; US 98 in Lakeland; US 27 in unincorporated Davenport; US 192 in Celebration; Florida&#x27;s Turnpike in Orlando; and US 17 and US 92 in multiple junctions. In the east, I-4 ends at an interchange with I-95 in Daytona Beach, while SR 400 continues for roughly another and ends at an intersection with US 1 on the city line of Daytona Beach and South Daytona.

Construction on I-4 began in 1958; the first segment opened in 1959, and the entire highway was completed in 1965. The &quot;I-4 Ultimate&quot; project oversaw the construction of variable-toll express lanes and numerous redevelopments through the stretch of highway extending from Kirkman Road (SR 435; exit 75) in Orlando to SR 434 (exit 94) in Longwood. The project broke ground in 2015, and the express lanes opened to traffic on February 26, 2022. Previously, the median of I-4 between Tampa and Orlando was the planned route of a now-canceled high-speed rail line; however, Brightline, an inter-city rail route, plans to use the I-4 right-of-way for their expansion of service to Tampa. From a political standpoint, the &quot;I-4 corridor&quot; is a strategic region given the large number of undecided voters in a large swing state.

==Route description==

I-4 maintains a diagonal, northeast–southwest route for much of its length, although it is signed east–west. It roughly follows the original path of the South Florida Railroad built by Henry B. Plant in 1884.

The highway starts its eastward journey at an interchange with I-275—known as &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;—near Downtown Tampa and is the starting point for milemarkers and exit numbers (which are mileage-based). Just east of Malfunction Junction, I-4 passes along the north side of Tampa&#x27;s Ybor City district, where a mile-long () connector links to the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 618) and Port Tampa Bay. I-4 continues east past the Florida State Fairgrounds toward a turbine interchange (uncommon in the US) with I-75.
After passing near the eastern suburbs of Hillsborough County—including Brandon and Plant City—it enters Polk County, where I-4 crosses along the north side of Lakeland. The Polk Parkway (SR 570) forms a semi-loop through Lakeland&#x27;s southern suburbs and returns to I-4 at the Florida Polytechnic University campus, near Polk City; it does not serve as a bypass route for I-4 traffic. Just after the western junction with the Polk Parkway, I-4 turns from an eastward to a northeastward heading. Between SR 33 (at exit 38) and US 27, I-4 passes through the fog-prone Green Swamp, although the landscape beside the highway is mostly forest as opposed to water-logged swampland. Ten variable-message signs and dozens of cameras and vehicle detection systems monitor this stretch of mostly-rural highway as a result of several large, deadly pileups caused by dense fog.
At mile 57, I-4 enters Osceola County and, soon thereafter, intersects Greater Orlando&#x27;s beltways: the incomplete Western Expressway (SR 429) on the western side and the Central Florida GreeneWay (SR 417) which rounds the eastern side before returning to I-4 in Sanford. Additionally, an exit to World Drive (signed as just &quot;Disney World&quot;) runs north as a limited-access highway into Walt Disney World and an electric pylon in the shape of Mickey Mouse can be seen on the southwest corner of the intersection. The single Central Florida GreeneWay/World Drive exit (exit 62) also marks an abrupt change from rural to suburban/urban landscape. The highway passes beside Celebration and Kissimmee on the east side and Walt Disney World (not visible) on the west side.

For the next , I-4 passes through Greater Orlando, where the highway forms the main north–south artery. It enters Orange County, passes through Walt Disney World and by SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando, and intersects all of the area&#x27;s major toll roads, including the Beachline Expressway (SR 528), Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, and the East–West Expressway (SR 408). Orlando&#x27;s main tourist strip—International Drive—runs parallel and no more than from I-4 between Kissimmee and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. Between Michigan Street and Kaley Avenue (about mile 81), I-4 turns due north (while still being signed east–west), heading past Downtown Orlando and its northern suburbs. A section of I-4 from west of SR 435 to east of SR 434 (miles 75–96) underwent a $2.3-billion reconstruction, and was completed on February 26, 2022. This project replaced most bridges, changed the configurations of many intersections, and added two express toll lanes—named I-4 Express—in each direction.

After passing along the west side of Downtown Orlando, I-4 continues through the city&#x27;s northern suburbs—including Winter Park, Maitland, Altamonte Springs, and Sanford. Around mile 91, I-4 enters Seminole County and, soon thereafter, shifts to a northeast heading. The Seminole Expressway (SR 417), after passing around the east side of Greater Orlando, has its northern terminus (exit 101B) at I-4 in Sanford. This intersection will also connect with the Wekiva Parkway (SR 429), currently under construction, when it is completed in mid-2023, at which point a full beltway (SR 429/SR 417; concurrent with I-4 for ) around Greater Orlando will be available. On October 21, 2022, the first part of this connection opened to traffic, with the westbound I-4 to southbound SR 429 ramp opening to traffic, along with the section of the southbound lanes between the ramp and SR 46.
North of Sanford, I-4 is carried by the St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge over the St. Johns River at the mouth of Lake Monroe. Along the bridge, I-4 enters Volusia County and passes Deltona and DeLand. The segment north of SR 44 has been widened from four to six lanes. Completed in winter 2016–2017, the entire length of I-4 has at least six lanes (three or more per direction). I-4 terminates at a junction with I-95 in Daytona Beach. SR 400 continues east into Daytona Beach to US 1.

===Services===
I-4 has two pairs of rest areas, one near Polk City and the other near Longwood. At each location, there are separate facilities on opposite sides of the freeway that provide services to traffic in both directions. The rest areas all provide disabled facilities with restrooms, picnic tables, drinking water, pet exercise areas, outside night lights, telephones, vending machines, and nighttime security.

FDOT closed a pair of rest areas at the Daryl Carter Parkway overpass (mile 70) near Lake Buena Vista in early 1999 and replaced them with retention ponds to serve runoff from an additional lane in each direction of I-4. Another former rest area, without any bathrooms, existed on the eastbound side near mile 127 in Volusia County.

A pair of weigh stations including weigh in motion scales is present at mile 12 between Tampa and Plant City. They were opened in January 2009 to replace a pair just west of the SR 566 interchange at mile 19.

==History==

I-4 was one of the first Interstate Highways to be constructed in Florida, with the first section opening between Plant City and Lakeland in 1959. By early 1960, the Howard Frankland Bridge was opened to traffic, as well as the segment from the Hillsborough Avenue/US 301 junction in Tampa to Plant City. The stretch from Lake Monroe to Lake Helen, including the original St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge also opened during that period. The segment from Tampa to Orlando was complete by 1962. By the mid-1960s, several segments were already complete, including Malfunction Junction in Tampa and parts of I-4 through Orlando. The original western terminus was set at Central Avenue (County Road 150 [CR 150]) in St. Petersburg, though a non-Interstate extension would have continued south and west to Pasadena. Proposed I-4 was later extended southwest to the present location of I-275 exit 20, with a planned temporary end at US 19 and 13th Avenue South, and a continuation to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge was also designated as part of I-4. Construction was stalled at 9th Street North (CR 803) for several years.
The entire Interstate Highway was completed by the late 1960s; however, the western terminus was truncated to Malfunction Junction in 1971 when I-75 was extended over the Howard Frankland Bridge. Eventually, that stretch was again redesignated to become part of I-275.

In maps and atlases dating to the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the Tampa–St. Petersburg section of I-4/I-275 was marked as the Tampa Expressway. The Orlando segment was marked as the Orlando Expressway. Both names have since faded from maps.

Although many post-1970 interchanges along I-4 were constructed before the recent widening projects, they were designed with I-4 expansion in mind. In other words, there is enough room available to widen I-4 to up to 10 lanes without extensively modifying the interchanges. Some of these interchanges include the I-75 stack (constructed in the 1980s) and several interchanges serving the Walt Disney World Resort (constructed in the late 1980s and early 1990s).

In 2002, I-4, along with most of Florida&#x27;s Interstates, switched over from a sequential exit numbering system to a mileage-based exit numbering system.

A section of I-4 between Daytona Beach and Orlando, called the &quot;dead zone&quot;, is rumored to be haunted. In 2010, the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council (ECFRPC), using geographic information system technology, performed an analysis to determine if this identified zone had an increased fatality rate related to crashes. The analysis, which compared this section of I-4 to several other dangerous I-4 sections, found that, while the dead zone area did not have the highest accident or fatality rate, it did identify that the percentage of fatality to accident was significantly higher in this location. Multiple hurricanes, including three category 4 hurricanes (Donna, Charley, and Ian) have also passed over that area.

The median of I-4 between Tampa and Orlando was slated to be used for the Florida High-Speed Corridor line between those cities. As a result of a state constitutional amendment to build a high-speed rail system between its five largest cities passed by voters in 2000, construction projects on I-4 included a wide median to accommodate a high-speed rail line. The high-speed rail project was canceled in 2004 but revived again in 2009. In 2010, the federal government awarded Florida over $2 billion (equivalent to $ in )—nearly the entire projected construction cost—to build the line, with work on the project to begin in 2011 and be completed by 2014. However, Governor Rick Scott&#x27;s rejection of the funding ended the project.

On January 9, 2008, 70 vehicles were involved in a large pileup on I-4 near Polk City. The pileup was caused by an unexpected thick morning fog that was mixed with a scheduled—and approved—environmental burn by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The fog drifted across I-4, mixing with the smoke and reducing visibility to near-zero conditions. Four people were killed and 38 were injured. The section of I-4 did not reopen until the next day, January 10.

===Tampa area===

The I-4/I-275 interchange (Malfunction Junction) was rebuilt from 2002 to 2007, and I-4 has been widened from four to six lanes (with eight lanes in certain segments).

Eastbound I-4 shifted to its new, permanent alignment between Malfunction Junction and 50th Street on August 8, 2006. The new alignment includes a right-lane ramp exit/entry at the 22nd Street/21st Street Interchange (the previous left-lane configuration was causing hazardous conditions to commuters since its opening in 2005). On August 11, 2006, a fourth lane opened on eastbound I-4 between the downtown junction and 50th Street (led in by a newly opened third lane on the eastbound I-4 ramp from northbound I-275). And, on August 18, the new westbound alignment, just west of 50th Street, opened. The newly opened lanes will improve flow throughout the interchange. The 50th Street overpass, however, would not be complete until late 2007. Also, the eastbound I-4 exit ramp to Columbus Drive/50th Street is situated to the left-hand side of the highway (as opposed to its former right-hand side exit). This exit shift went into effect in spring 2006 and is part of the new, permanent Interstate configuration.

In Tampa, the exit to 40th Street (SR 569), exit 2, was closed and demolished in late 2005 due to the ongoing reconstruction of I-4 and to accommodate a proposed connector highway with the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway.

The interchange with what is today I-75 was constructed in the early 1980s.

===Greater Orlando===

As Orlando grew in the 1970s and 1980s, traffic became a growing concern, especially after the construction of the original interchange with the East–West Expressway in 1973, which proved to become a principal bottleneck. The term &quot;highway hostages&quot; was coined in the 1980s to describe people stuck in long commutes to and from Orlando on I-4.


In the early-to-mid-1990s, several interchanges near Kissimmee were constructed or upgraded to accommodate increasing traffic going to and from Walt Disney World. However, I-4&#x27;s mainlanes were not widened in the process. Around the same time, SR 417 was extended to I-4. Improvements to the US 192 junction were completed in 2007.

The St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge, a two-span, six-lane replacement to the original four-lane bridge over the St. Johns River northeast of Orlando, was completed in 2004.

During the early 2000s, tolled express lanes were being planned in the Orlando area as a traffic congestion relief technique for rush-hour commuters. The name for them was to be Xpress 400, numbered after the state road designation for I-4. The express lanes were slated to extend from Universal Orlando, east to SR 434 in Longwood, and tolls were to be collected electronically via transponders like SunPass and Central Florida Expressway Authority&#x27;s E-PASS, with prices dependent on the congestion of the eight mainlanes. However, the project was effectively banned by the passage of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users federal transportation bill in 2005, introduced by US Representative John Mica. The plan for tolled express lanes is now moving forward as part of the $2.3-billion I-4 Ultimate project.

Interim improvements to the interchange at SR 408 were completed at the end of 2008. The eastbound exit to Robinson Street (SR 526) permanently closed on April 25, 2006, to make way for construction of the new eastbound onramp from SR 408. The westbound offramp to Gore Street was permanently closed in the same project on November 2, 2008.

The new overpass from I-4 west to John Young Parkway (CR 423) opened the morning of April 27, 2006.

===Recent history===

====Recent widening====
The final four-lane segment of I-4, from SR 44 to I-95, was widened to six lanes. Completed in winter 2016–2017, the whole highway is at least six lanes wide.

====I-4 Ultimate Project====

A $2.3-billion (in year-of-expenditure dollars) project—dubbed I-4 Ultimate—reconstructed a stretch of I-4 through Orlando from SR 435 (exit 75) east to SR 434 (exit 94). The most noticeable change is the addition of four variable-toll express lanes along this section, called I-4 Express. The toll rates maintain an average speed of . Additionally, the general-use lanes were rebuilt, 15 major interchanges were reconfigured, 53 new bridges were added, and 75 bridges were replaced. A pedestrian bridge was built over the highway near Maitland Boulevard, with a second pedestrian bridge being built over SR 435 at the intersection with both Major Boulevard and Tom Williams Way. A pedestrian tunnel was constructed under SR 436. The project also reduced the curve radius and improved line-of-sight along the notorious Fairbanks Curve south of Fairbanks Avenue, which is the most accident-prone section of I-4.

FDOT proposed adding barrier-separated high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to I-4 through Greater Orlando in the 1990s, possibly funded by tolls, but proposals for express lanes (including reversible toll lanes and high-occupancy toll [HOT] lanes) were blocked by politics for the next 15 years. In 2012, a legislative ban on tolls along I-4, which had been in place for seven years, ended, and FDOT began soliciting private enterprises to build and help finance the project in a public–private partnership. In February 2013, the state legislature and governor gave approval for FDOT to proceed with the public–private partnership on this section of I-4 in February 2013, and, the following year, FDOT selected I-4 Mobility Partners to design, construct, finance, maintain, and operate the project for 40 years. FDOT and I-4 Mobility Partners reached commercial and financial close, and a public–private partnership concession agreement was executed in September 2014. The final design phase began in October 2014. On February 1, 2015, FDOT turned the project over to I-4 Mobility Partners, and, on February 18, transportation officials and the governor held a groundbreaking ceremony for the project in Maitland. After seven years of construction, the express lanes opened to traffic the morning of February 26, 2022, and began tolling on March 3, 2022.

====Connection with Wekiva Parkway (SR 429)====

After spending $255 million dollars, FDOT completed the Wekiva Parkway by building 2.63 miles of expressway between Orange Boulevard and the I-4/SR 417 junction in Sanford. The project was completed on January 26, 2024, completing the beltway around Central Florida. The project also involves building future I-4 Beyond the Ultimate lanes from SR 417 to SR 46.

==Future==

===I-4 Beyond the Ultimate===
I-4 Beyond the Ultimate, which includes proposed extensions of the I-4 Express toll lanes, both southwest and northeast of the I-4 Ultimate project, are being considered. In 2013, FDOT initiated a study to reevaluate previous feasibility studies, made between 1998 and 2005, in which the addition of HOV or express toll lanes were considered. The extensions cover approximately of I-4 through Greater Orlando. Southwest of the I-4 Ultimate, the study is examining an extension through Osceola County to US 27 in Polk County. Northeast of the I-4 Ultimate, the study is examining an extension through Seminole County to SR 472 in Volusia County.

In addition to these express lane extensions, many interchanges will be reconstructed as part of the project. Some of these reconstructed interchanges will be converted to diverging diamond interchanges, which are proposed at both CR 532 (exit 58; implemented on July 10, 2022) and SR 482 (exit 74A; implemented on March 9, 2024). A brand new interchange at Daryl Carter Parkway is also proposed to be a diverging diamond.

Unlike I-4 Ultimate, where the encompassed by that project were constructed at once, the encompassed by I-4 Beyond the Ultimate will be constructed in phases.

As part of the &quot;Moving Florida Forward&quot; initiative, construction of I-4 widening between Championsgate and Osceola Parkway will add additional lanes on this 15-mile segment, which is expected to begin construction in late 2024.

===Additional express lanes===
Express toll lanes are also being considered for I-4 in the Tampa Bay area. In January 2015, FDOT unveiled its master plan for a system of express toll lanes—dubbed Tampa Bay Express (TBX)—on I-4, I-75, and I-275 and began public meetings for community input. On I-4, these lanes would extend approximately from I-275 to west of the Polk Parkway (SR 570). At the junction with I-275, the initial concept alignment calls for a direct connection between the express toll lanes of both highways. Express bus lanes for regional service and a long-distance bus service were studied for inclusion in the plan. The I-4 corridor was considered in the bus lane study, but the resultant proposal included installation only on I-275 and I-75.

===Other projects===

Connections with two new expressways are planned. The Wekiva Parkway—a segment of SR 429—will connect to SR 417 at the I-4 interchange in Sanford. When completed in 2023, it will complete the beltway around Orlando, although the southern ends of SR 429 and SR 417 do not connect and are separated by a drive along I-4. On October 21, 2022, the first part of this connection opened to traffic, with the westbound I-4 to southbound SR 429 ramp opening to traffic, along with the section of the southbound lanes between the ramp and SR 46. The Central Polk Parkway is a planned tolled expressway in eastern Polk County that will connect I-4 near Davenport with the Polk Parkway near Bartow; it is currently in the design phase, but funding for right-of-way acquisition of the initial segments is not planned until fiscal year 2019–2020. Additionally, FDOT is conducting a feasibility study for a connection between I-4 and the Poinciana Parkway—a short, tolled expressway completed in 2016 between US 17/US 92 and the community of Poinciana.

Despite the cancellation of the Florida High-Speed Corridor in 2011, the following year, All Aboard Florida, now Brightline, announced its intentions to build an inter-city rail route between Miami and Orlando, which eventually began operations in September 2023. Brightline is currently in the planning stages of developing an expansion of service between Orlando and Tampa using the I-4 right-of-way.

In 2014, FDOT began a study of the feasibility of extending the SunRail commuter train line to Daytona Beach, primarily focusing on the use of the I-4 median. The ongoing widening project from SR 44 to I-95 maintains a median wide enough to accommodate a future rail line.

==Exit list==






























==State Road 400==
State Road 400 (SR 400) is an unsigned highway while running concurrently with I-4 from their shared western terminus at I-275 in Tampa through the last eastbound exit before the eastern terminus of I-4, at I-95 in Daytona Beach. SR 400 is named Beville Road beyond I-95 and continues for another to its own eastern terminus at an intersection with US 1 on the city line between Daytona Beach and South Daytona. Sections of the nonconcurrent SR 400 are classified as a &quot;scenic thoroughfare&quot; within Daytona Beach.
===Major intersections===





==In politics==

In the 2004 US presidential election in Florida, the I-4 corridor, a commonly used term to refer to the counties in which I-4 runs through and a site of significant population growth, was a focus of political activity within the swing state. Communities along the I-4 corridor were perceived by both major political parties as having higher proportions of undecided voters as compared to more Republican- or Democratic-leaning portions of the state. It played an equally key role in the 2008 US presidential election in Florida but, whereas the corridor had voted heavily for George W. Bush in 2004, which helped Bush win the state, in 2008, it swung behind Democratic candidate Barack Obama, helping Obama win Florida.

Between 1996 and 2012, the I-4 corridor voted for the statewide winner. However, in the 2016 and 2020 elections, Republican Donald Trump carried the state without winning the region. The Republicans carried the region three times while the Democrats carried the region five times in the past eight presidential elections. Republicans George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush won more votes than other candidates in 1992, 2000, and 2004, while Democrats Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden captured the region&#x27;s vote total in the elections of 1996, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

Trump again won the 2024 United States presidential election in Florida. WKMG-TV reported that because of the size of his victory of more than 13%, Florida was no longer a swing state. Noting that Trump had won all nine central Florida counties except Orange County, the station said that &quot;the days of the I-4 corridor being a thing [are] no more&quot;.

<text>Annwn, Annwfn, or Annwfyn (; &quot;Annwvn&quot;, &quot;Annwyn&quot;, &quot;Annwyfn&quot;, &quot;Annwvyn&quot;, or &quot;Annwfyn&quot;) is the Otherworld in Welsh mythology. Ruled by Arawn (or, in Arthurian literature, by Gwyn ap Nudd), it is a world of delights and eternal youth where disease is absent and food is ever-abundant.

==Name and etymology==
Middle Welsh sources suggest that the term was recognised as meaning &quot;very deep&quot; in medieval times. The appearance of a form &quot;antumnos&quot; on an ancient Gaulish curse tablet, which means &quot;an&quot; (&#x27;other&#x27;) + &quot;tumnos&quot; (&#x27;world&#x27;), however, suggests that the original term may have been *&quot;ande-dubnos&quot;, a common Gallo-Brittonic word that literally meant &quot;underworld&quot;. The pronunciation of Modern Welsh &quot;Annwn&quot; is .

==Whereabouts of Annwn==
In both Welsh and Irish mythologies, the Otherworld was believed to be located either on an island or underneath the earth. In the First Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, it is implied that Annwn is a land within Dyfed, while the context of the Arthurian poem &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot; suggests an island location. Two other otherworldly feasts that occur in the Second Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; are located in Harlech in northwest Wales and on Ynys Gwales in southwest Pembrokeshire.

==Locations inside Annwn==

* Caer Sidi (&quot;Revolving/Spinning Fortress&quot;) A fortress containing the Cauldron of Annwn, the &quot;Chair&quot; of Taliesin, and where Gweir was imprisoned.
It was also named:
* Caer Wydyr (&quot;Glass Fortress&quot;) A fortress guarded by six thousand men whose watchman was difficult to converse with.
* Caer Pedryvan (&quot;Four cornered/peaked fortress&quot;) A fortress located on the &quot;Isle of the strong door&quot;
* Caer Vedwyd (&quot;Fortress of Revelry/Drunkenness&quot;)
* Caer Vandwy (&quot;Fortress of God&#x27;s Peak&quot;)
* Caer Rigor (&quot;Kingly Fortress&quot;/&quot;Fortress of Hardness&quot;)
* Caer Golud (&quot;Fortress of Riches&quot;)

==Appearances in Welsh literature==
Annwn plays a reasonably prominent role in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, a set of four interlinked mythological tales dating from the early medieval period. In the First Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, entitled &quot;Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed&quot;, the eponymous prince offends Arawn, ruler of Annwn, by baiting his hunting hounds on a stag that Arawn&#x27;s dogs had brought down. In recompense he exchanges places with Arawn for a year and defeats Arawn&#x27;s enemy Hafgan, while Arawn rules in his stead in Dyfed. During this year, Pwyll abstains from sleeping with Arawn&#x27;s wife, earning himself gratitude and eternal friendship from Arawn. On his return, Pwyll becomes known by the title &quot;Penn Annwn&quot;, &quot;Head (or Ruler) of Annwn.&quot; In the Fourth Branch, Arawn is mentioned but does not appear; it is revealed that he sent a gift of otherworldly pigs to Pwyll&#x27;s son and successor, Pryderi, which ultimately leads to war between Dyfed and Gwynedd.

The similarly mythological epic poem &quot;Cad Goddeu&quot; describes a battle between Gwynedd and the forces of Annwn, led again by Arawn. It is revealed that Amaethon, nephew to Math, king of Gwynedd, stole a bitch, a lapwing and a roebuck from the Otherworld, leading to a war between the two peoples. The denizens of Annwn are depicted as bizarre and hellish creatures; these include a &quot;wide-mawed&quot; beast with a hundred heads and bearing a host beneath the root of its tongue and another under its neck, a hundred-clawed black-groined toad, and a &quot;mottled ridged serpent, with a thousand souls, by their sins, tortured in the holds of its flesh&quot;. Gwydion, the Venedotian hero and magician successfully defeats Arawn&#x27;s army, first by enchanting the trees to rise up and fight and then by guessing the name of the enemy hero Bran, thus winning the battle.

&quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot;, an early medieval poem found in the Book of Taliesin, describes a voyage led by King Arthur to the numerous otherworldy kingdoms within Annwn, either to rescue the prisoner Gweir or to retrieve the cauldron of the Head of Annwn. The narrator of the poem is possibly intended to be Taliesin himself. One line can be interpreted as implying that he received his gift of poetry or speech from a magic cauldron, as Taliesin does in other texts, and Taliesin&#x27;s name is connected to a similar story in another work. The speaker relates how he journeyed with Arthur and three boatloads of men into Annwfn, but only seven returned. Annwfn is apparently referred to by several names, including &quot;Mound Fortress,&quot; &quot;Four-Peaked Fortress,&quot; and &quot;Glass Fortress&quot;, though it is possible the poet intended these to be distinct places. Within the Mound Fort&#x27;s walls Gweir, one of the &quot;Three Exalted Prisoners of Britain&quot; known from the Welsh Triads, is imprisoned in chains. The narrator then describes the cauldron of the Chief of Annwn: it is finished with pearl and will not boil a coward&#x27;s food. Whatever tragedy ultimately killed all but seven of them is not clearly explained. The poem continues with an excoriation of &quot;little men&quot; and monks, who lack various forms of knowledge possessed by the poet.

Over time, the role of king of Annwn was transferred to Gwyn ap Nudd, a hunter and psychopomp, who may have been the Welsh personification of winter. The Christian &quot;Vita Collen&quot; tells of Saint Collen vanquishing Gwyn and his otherworldly court from Glastonbury Tor with the use of holy water. In &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, an early Welsh Arthurian tale, it is said that God gave Gwyn ap Nudd control over the demons lest &quot;this world be destroyed.&quot; Tradition revolves around Gwyn leading his spectral hunts, the Cŵn Annwn (&quot;Hounds of Annwn&quot;), on his hunt for mortal souls. Angelika Rüdiger&#x27;s Doctoral Thesis, &#x27;Y Tylwyth Teg: an analysis of a literary motif&#x27; (Bangor University, 2021) is a detailed study of supernatural characters connected with Annwn (including Gwyn ap Nudd), covering a period from the earliest sources to the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Annwn in modern culture==
J. R. R. Tolkien used the word &quot;annún&quot; in his Middle-earth mythology as a term in the Elvish language Sindarin (phonologically inspired by Welsh) meaning &quot;west&quot; or &quot;sunset&quot; (cognate with the Quenya &quot;Andúnë&quot;), often referring figuratively to the &quot;True West&quot;, i.e. the blessed land of Aman beyond the Sea, the Lonely Island Tol Eressëa, or (in the later mannish usage) to the drowned island of Númenor. This is an example of Tolkien&#x27;s method of world-building by &quot;explaining the true meaning&quot; of various real-world words by assigning them an alternative &quot;Elvish&quot; etymology. The Sindarin word for &#x27;king&#x27;, &quot;aran&quot; is also similar to , the king of .

The Anglo-Welsh author, poet, critic and playwright, David Jones Annwn (born 1953) adopted the name Annwn in 1975 in the same spirit that his great-uncle, the Welsh bard , had adopted the name Ap Hefin (&quot;Son of the Summer Solstice&quot;).

Annwn is the name of a German medieval and pagan folk duo from North Rhine-Westphalia. The name was also previously used by an unrelated Celtic Rock trio in Berkeley, California, from 1991 until the death of lead singer Leigh Ann Hussey on 16 May 2006.

Annwn is one of the deep realms of Faerie in &quot;October Daye&quot;, a 2012 urban fantasy series written by Seanan McGuire.

British author Niel Bushnell&#x27;s novels &quot;Sorrowline&quot; and &quot;Timesmith&quot; feature an island called Annwn in the realm of Otherworld.

Children&#x27;s author Lloyd Alexander used the name &quot;Annuvin&quot;, an Anglicized spelling of the variant &quot;Annwfyn&quot;, in his &quot;Chronicles of Prydain&quot; series. Annuvin is the domain of Arawn, who in these novels plays the role of a villainous dark lord.

On the British rock band The Mechanisms&#x27; 2014 album &quot;High Noon Over Camelot&quot;, a space Western retelling of the Arthurian mythos, &quot;Annwn&quot; is the name given to the lower levels of the space station Fort Galfridian. 

One of the areas in the platform-adventure video game &quot;La-Mulana 2&quot; is named Annwfn.

&quot;Annwn: The Otherworld&quot; is a surreal stealth/strategy game drawing on Welsh mythic motifs.

<text>Gwyn ap Nudd (, sometimes found with the antiquated spelling Gwynn ap Nudd) is a Welsh mythological figure, the king of the &quot;Tylwyth Teg&quot; or &quot;fair folk&quot; and ruler of the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn, and whose name means “Gwyn, son of Nudd”. Described later on as a great warrior with a &quot;blackened face&quot;, Gwyn is intimately associated with the otherworld in medieval Welsh literature, and is associated with the international tradition of the Wild Hunt.

==Family==
Gwyn is the son of Nudd and would thus be grandson to Beli Mawr and nephew of Arianrhod, Llefelys, Penarddun, Afallach, Gofannon, Nynniaw, Peibaw, and Caswallawn. Based on their shared patronymic (&quot;ap Nudd&quot;), his siblings include Edern, a warrior who appears in a number of Arthurian texts, and Owain ap Nudd, who is mentioned briefly in Geraint and Enid. In &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, Gwyn is the lover of Creiddylad, the daughter of Lludd, who may therefore be Gwyn&#x27;s own sister, though that connection was not made by the medieval author(s) of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.

==Legends==
===The abduction of Creiddylad===
Gwyn plays a prominent role in the early Arthurian tale &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; in which he abducts his sister Creiddylad from her betrothed, Gwythyr ap Greidawl. In retaliation, Gwythyr raised a great host against Gwyn, leading to a vicious battle between the two. Gwyn was victorious and, following the conflict, captured a number of Gwythyr&#x27;s noblemen including Nwython and his son Cyledr. Gwyn would later murder Nwython, and force Cyledr to eat his father&#x27;s heart. As a result of his torture at Gwyn&#x27;s hands, Cyledr went mad, earning the epithet &quot;Wyllt&quot;.

After the intervention of Arthur, Gwyn and Gwythr agreed to fight for Creiddylad every May Day until Judgement Day. The warrior who was victorious on this final day would at last take the maiden. According to &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, Gwyn was &quot;placed over the brood of devils in Annwn, lest they should destroy the present race&quot;.

===As part of Arthur&#x27;s retinue===
Before he can win Olwen&#x27;s hand, Culhwch ap Cilydd must complete a number of seemingly impossible tasks given to him by Olwen&#x27;s father, the giant Ysbaddaden. One of these tasks is to retrieve the comb and scissors from the head of the vicious boar, Twrch Trwyth. As it is impossible to hunt the boar without Gwyn&#x27;s aid, he is called upon to join Arthur and his retinue against Twrch Trwyth. During the hunt, he is mounted on Du y Moroedd, the only horse that can carry him. Both Gwyn and Gwythyr set out with Arthur to retrieve the blood of Orddu, witch of the uplands of hell.

===Other exploits===
Gwyn appears prominently in the medieval poem &quot;The Dialogue of Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwyddno Garanhir&quot;, found in the Black Book of Carmarthen. In this narrative—Gwyn, returning from battle, chances upon Gwyddno Garanhir, king of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod, and grants him his protection. Gwyn then relates his exploits on the battlefield and his role as a psychopomp, a mysterious figure who gathers the souls of fallen British warriors, such as Bran the Blessed, Meurig ap Carreian, Gwendoleu ap Ceidaw and Llacheu ab Arthur. His skill in combat is extolled in this poem; he is described as &quot;the hope of armies&quot; and &quot;hero of hosts&quot; and, when asked from which region he comes, he simply replies: &quot;I come from battle and conflict.&quot; The poem ends with Gwyn&#x27;s proclamation:

His role as a psychopomp is paralleled in his later tradition as leader of the Wild Hunt, in which he leads a pack of supernatural hounds known as the &quot;Cŵn Annwn&quot; to harvest human souls. In Welsh folklore, to hear the baying of Gwyn&#x27;s hounds was a portent of imminent death in the family. In &quot;The Dialogue&quot;, Gwyn is also accompanied by a hound, namely as Dormarth of the ruddy nose.

Gwyn apparently witnessed a &quot;conflict&quot; before Caer Vandwy, an otherworldly fortress mentioned in Preiddeu Annwfn.

===Later traditions===
Over time, Gwyn&#x27;s role would diminish and, in later folklore, he was regarded as the king of the &quot;Tylwyth Teg&quot;, the fairies of Welsh lore. He appears as a simpler figure in &quot;Buchedd Collen&quot; (&quot;The Life of Saint Collen&quot;), in which he and his retinue are vanquished from Glastonbury Tor with the use of holy water. According to the &quot;Speculum Christiani&quot;, a fourteenth century manuscript against divination, Welsh soothsayers would invoke Gwyn&#x27;s name before entering woodlands, proclaiming: &quot;to the king of Spirits, and to his queen—
Gwyn ap Nudd, 
you who are yonder in the forest, 
for love of your mate, 
permit us to enter your dwelling.&quot;

The celebrated fourteenth-century bard Dafydd ap Gwilym refers to Gwyn in a number of texts, suggesting that the character was widely known in Wales during the medieval period. In &quot;Y Dylluan&quot;, he describes the eponymous owl as the &quot;fowl of Gwyn ap Nudd&quot;. &quot;Y Pwll Mawn&quot;, in which the bard tells an unfortunate autobiographical account in which he and his horse were almost drowned in a lake, described as the &quot;fish lake of Gwyn ap Nudd&quot; and &quot;the palace of the elves and their children.&quot;

Gwyn is often associated with the Wild Hunt, in a role akin to Woden or Herne the Hunter. Some traditions name Gwyn&#x27;s chief huntsman as Iolo ap Huw, who, every Halloween, &quot;may be found cheering Cŵn Annwn over Cader Idris&quot;. In the Black Book of Carmarthen Gwyn states that his finest hound is Dormarch.

According to a 14th century Latin manuscript against witchcraft, Welsh &quot;dynion hysbys&quot; (soothsayers) would repeat the following:

The Latin term &quot;Eumenidium&quot; is used, which can be translated as &quot;the Benevolent Ones&quot; and act as an euphemism to mean &quot;y tylwyth teg&quot; or &quot;faeries&quot;, and the king of the faeries is Gwyn ap Nudd; with logic, it could be argued that Gwyn ap Nudd is &quot;Eumenidium.&quot;

==Etymology==
&quot;Gwyn&quot; means &quot;fair, bright, white&quot;, cognate with the Irish &quot;fionn&quot;, both deriving from a reconstructed Common Celtic stem &quot;*windos&quot; &#x27;the white one&#x27;. As such, he has some connection to the Irish hero Fionn mac Cumhail, whose maternal great-grandfather was Nuada. The name of Gwyn&#x27;s father, Nudd, appears like Nuada to be cognate with the Brythonic deity Nodens.

&quot;Gwyn&quot; is in everyday use as a common noun and adjective: it also remains a popular personal name. Especially in Old and Middle Welsh, &quot;gwyn&quot; also has the connotations of &quot;pure, sacred, holy&quot;.

<doc id="86012" wikidata="Q1437118" url="?curid=86012" title="Gwythyr ap Greidawl">
<text>In Welsh mythology, Gwythyr ap Greidawl was a rival of Gwyn ap Nudd, a deity connected with the otherworld. In the Middle Welsh prose tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, he is named as a member of Arthur&#x27;s retinue and takes part in the quest to win the hand of Olwen for Arthur&#x27;s cousin, Culhwch. Gwthyr would join Arthur on a journey to Pennant Gofid in Hell to retrieve the blood of the witch Orddu. His father is Greidawl Galldonyd, a fellow knight in Arthur&#x27;s court. In &quot;Bonedd yr Arwyr&quot;, his genealogy is given as Gwythyr son of Greidawl the son of Enfael the son of Deigyr the son of Dyfnwal the son of Ednyfed the son of Maxen the son of Llywelyn. The Welsh Triads name him as the father of Arthur&#x27;s second wife, also named Gwenhwyfar.

Sometime before the main events of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, Gwythyr was engaged to marry Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd, who was stolen from him by her brother, Gwyn ap Nudd. In a violent battle, Gwyn defeated his rival, kept Creiddylad and took a number of Gwythyr&#x27;s chieftains prisoner. When Arthur heard of this, he forced Gwyn to release the noblemen and made peace between the two adversaries.

Every Calan Mai, the two would fight over Creiddylad, until a battle on Judgment Day, in which the victor would keep her forever. Their rivalry has been taken to represent the contest between summer and winter and is a variant of the Holly King myth.

<text>Creiddylad (also known as &quot;Creirddylad&quot;, &quot;Creurdilad&quot;, &quot;Creudylad&quot; or &quot;Kreiddylat&quot;), daughter of King Lludd, is a minor character in the early medieval Welsh Arthurian tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;.

== Role in Welsh tradition ==
Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd Silver Hand, is a lady living at the court of King Arthur. Considered to be the most beautiful girl in the British Isles, she is loved by two of Arthur&#x27;s warriors: Gwythyr and Gwyn. Her rival suitors are thrust into conflict when Gwythyr abducts her from her father&#x27;s house, to which Gwyn retaliates by kidnapping her from Gwythyr. Due to Arthur&#x27;s intervention in the ensuing feud, the lady Creiddylad is returned to her father and an arrangement (a &quot;dihenydd&quot;, or &quot;fate&quot;) is made that forces the adversaries to engage in single combat for the object of their love every May Day—while she is destined to remain with her father, unmarried—until a final battle on Judgement Day, which will determine who keeps her forever.

Creiddylad has been compared to the Greek springtime goddess Persephone, who is similarly abducted by an admirer (the underworld god Hades), rescued by an intervening character (Zeus), and reunited with her family (her mother Demeter), then cursed to repeat the experience every year. Here, the warrior duo&#x27;s ritual battle for possession of Creiddylad may be understood as a version of the &quot;Holly King&quot; myth, possibly personifying the dynamic power struggle between summer and winter.

It is also observed that the name of Creiddylad&#x27;s father (Lludd) and that of Gwyn&#x27;s father (Nudd) are likely cognate, which suggests that the characters are different incarnations of the pan-Celtic deity Nodons. Hence, Gwyn is often described as Creiddylad&#x27;s brother.

Additionally, she is sometimes confused with the goddess Creirwy, who is also referred to as the most beautiful girl in the world.

==In literature==
=== Cordelia ===
Creiddylad is traditionally identified as the prototype of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudo-historical Queen Cordeilla, who is the source of William Shakespeare&#x27;s heroine Cordelia (the youngest daughter of King Lear). This identification can be found in the 1833 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Lady Charlotte Guest, in the notes to her edition of &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;, which was first published in 1849, identifies Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd Llaw Ereint, with Cordelia, &quot;daughter of Lludd, or Lear&quot;. In 1891, Sir John Rhys repeated this identification in &quot;Studies in the Arthurian Legend&quot;.

However, Geoffrey&#x27;s Welsh translators failed to use the name Creiddylad in their Latin-to-Welsh translations of &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, where he used &quot;Cordeilla&quot;. Further complicating the association, the legends surrounding Creiddylad and Cordelia are very different. Doubt has been cast on the linking of these two names, beyond &quot;the string of consonants C-R-D-L&quot;.

===John Cowper Powys===
Novelist John Cowper Powys, as an admirer of both Guest&#x27;s &quot;Mabinogion&quot; as well as the work of Sir John Rhys, was aware of the idea that Creiddylad can be identified with Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Queen Cordelia. In &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot;, Cordelia Geard&#x27;s name may indicate a mythological identification with Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd in &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;. In Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;, which is set in Wales, Creiddylad, was the eponymous protagonist&#x27;s giantess great-grandmother, as well as the name he gives to a young giantess whom he mates with.

<doc id="86018" wikidata="Q298726" url="?curid=86018" title="John Zorn">
<text>John Zorn (born September 2, 1953) is an American composer, conductor, saxophonist, arranger and producer who &quot;deliberately resists category&quot;. His avant-garde and experimental approaches to composition and improvisation are inclusive of jazz, rock, Jewish music, hardcore, classical, contemporary, surf, metal, soundtrack, ambient, and world music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that Zorn has operated almost entirely outside the mainstream, he&#x27;s gradually asserted himself as one of the most influential musicians of our time&quot;.

Zorn engaged New York City&#x27;s downtown music scene in the mid-1970s, collaborating with improvising artists and experimenting with compositional strategies and arrangements. Over the next decade he performed throughout Europe and Japan and recorded on independent US and European labels. He released &quot;The Big Gundown&quot;, reconstructing the Spaghetti Western, gangster and war movie themes of Ennio Morricone, a formative musical influence, to acclaim in 1986. &quot;Spillane&quot; and &quot;Naked City&quot; further demonstrated Zorn&#x27;s ability to merge and blend musical styles in new and challenging formats.

Zorn spent significant time in Japan in the 1980s and early &#x27;90s returning to Lower East Side Manhattan to establish the Tzadik record label in 1995. Tzadik enabled Zorn to establish independence, maintain creative control, and ensure the availability of his growing catalog of recordings. He prolifically recorded and released new material for the label, issuing several new albums each year, along with recordings by many other artists.

Zorn performs on saxophone with his Naked City, Painkiller, and Masada bands, conducts ensembles such as Moonchild, Simulacrum, and several Masada-related groups or encourages musicians toward their own interpretations of his work. He has composed concert music for classical ensembles and orchestras, and produced music for opera, sound installations, film and documentary. Tours of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have been extensive, usually at festivals with musicians and ensembles that perform his repertoire.

==Early life and career==
===Early studies===
John Zorn was raised in Utopia, Queens and studied piano, guitar and flute at the United Nations International School. Zorn&#x27;s mother, Vera (née Studenski; 1918–1999), listened to classical and world music; his father, Henry Zorn (1913–1992), was interested in jazz, French chansons, and country music; and his older brother collected doo-wop and 1950s rock and roll records. Zorn spent his teenage years &quot;listening to The Doors and playing bass in a surf band&quot; while also exploring the experimental and avant-garde music of György Ligeti, Mauricio Kagel and Karlheinz Stockhausen and listening to cartoon soundtracks and film scores. 

Zorn taught himself orchestration and counterpoint by transcribing scores and studied composition under Leonardo Balada before enrolling at Webster College where he attended lectures by Oliver Lake. While at Webster he incorporated elements of free jazz, avant-garde and experimental music, film scores, performance art and the cartoon scores of Carl Stalling into his first recordings and discovered Anthony Braxton&#x27;s groundbreaking solo album &quot;For Alto&quot; which inspired him to take up the instrument. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to sit in some ivory tower and pass my scores down to the players.&quot; said Zorn, &quot;I have to be there with them, and that&#x27;s why I started playing saxophone, so that I could meet musicians. I still feel that I have to earn a player&#x27;s trust before they can play my music.&quot;

Leaving Webster after three semesters, Zorn lived on the West Coast before returning to Manhattan where he gave concerts in his apartment and other small NY venues, playing saxophone and a variety of reeds, duck calls, tapes, and other instruments. Zorn immersed himself in the underground art scene, assisting filmmaker Jack Smith with his performances and attending plays by Richard Foreman.

===Early compositions and recordings===
Zorn&#x27;s early major compositions included many game pieces described as &quot;complex systems harnessing improvisers in flexible compositional formats&quot;. These compositions &quot;involved strict rules, role playing, prompters with flashcards, all in the name of melding structure and improvisation in a seamless fashion&quot;. Zorn&#x27;s early game pieces had sporting titles like &quot;Lacrosse&quot; (1976), &quot;Hockey&quot; (1978), &quot;Pool&quot; (1979), and &quot;Archery&quot; (1979), which he recorded and first released on Eugene Chadbourne&#x27;s Parachute label. His most enduring game piece is &quot;Cobra&quot;, composed in 1984 and first recorded in 1987 and in subsequent versions in 1992, 1994 and , and revisited in performance many times.

In the early 1980s, Zorn was heavily engaged in improvisation as both a solo performer and with other like-minded artists. Zorn&#x27;s first solo saxophone recordings were originally released in two volumes as &quot;The Classic Guide to Strategy&quot; in 1983 and 1986 on the Lumina label. Zorn&#x27;s early small group improvisations are documented on &quot;Locus Solus&quot; (1983) which featured Zorn with various combinations of other improvisers including Christian Marclay, Arto Lindsay, Wayne Horvitz, Ikue Mori, and Anton Fier. &quot;Ganryu Island&quot; featured a series of duets by Zorn with Michihiro Sato on shamisen, which received limited release on the Yukon label in 1984. Zorn has subsequently reissued these early recordings.
===Breakthrough recordings===
Zorn&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1986 with the acclaimed &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; released on Nonesuch Records. The album was endorsed by composer Ennio Morricone, who said: &quot;This is a record that has fresh, good and intelligent ideas. It is realization on a high level, a work done by a maestro with great science-fantasy and creativity ... Many people have done versions of my pieces, but no one has done them like this&quot;.

Zorn followed with &quot;Spillane&quot; in 1987, his second major-label release, featuring performances by Albert Collins, the Kronos Quartet, and the sprawling title track, an early &quot;file-card&quot; composition. This method of combining composition and improvisation involved Zorn writing descriptions or ideas on file-cards and arranging them to form the piece. Zorn described the process in 2003:
I write in moments, in disparate sound blocks, so I find it convenient to store these events on filing cards so they can be sorted and ordered with minimum effort. Pacing is essential. If you move too fast, people tend to stop hearing the individual moments as complete in themselves and more as elements of a sort of cloud effect ... I worked 10 to 12 hours a day for a week, just orchestrating these file cards. It was an intense process.

Zorn&#x27;s file-card method of organizing sound blocks into an overall structure largely depended on the musicians he chose, the way they interpreted what was written on the file cards, and their relationship with Zorn who stated &quot;At the end of the day, I want players to say: this was fun—it was a lot of fucking work, and it&#x27;s one of the hardest things I&#x27;ve ever done, but it was worth the effort.&quot;

Three further releases on Nonesuch followed; &quot;Spy vs Spy&quot; in 1989, &quot;Naked City&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Filmworks 1986–1990&quot; (1992) before Zorn broke with the label.

==Music==
=== Jazz ===
Zorn demonstrated his hard bop credentials as a member of the Sonny Clark Memorial Quartet, recording &quot;Voodoo&quot; in 1986. &quot;News for Lulu&quot; (1988) and &quot;More News for Lulu&quot; (1992) featured Zorn, Bill Frisell and George E. Lewis performing compositions by Clark, Kenny Dorham, Freddie Redd, and Hank Mobley. He recorded &quot;Spy vs Spy&quot; featuring hardcore punk versions of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s compositions in 1989. According to Cook, &quot;Zorn&#x27;s admirers often consider him a masterful bebop alto player, but when he does perform in something approaching that style his playing has little of the tension and none of the relaxation of the great beboppers, often sounding more strangulated than anything&quot;.

===Film music===
Zorn stated that &quot;After my record &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; came out I was convinced that a lot of soundtrack work was going to be coming my way&quot;. While interest from Hollywood was not forthcoming, eventually independent filmmakers like Sheila McLaughlin and Raúl Ruiz sought his talents. Filmmaker Walter Hill rejected his music for a film to be called &quot;Looters&quot;. Although Zorn&#x27;s score did not make the final cut he used the money he received to establish the record label, Tzadik, on which he released &quot;Filmworks II: Music for an Untitled Film by Walter Hill&quot; in 1995. Zorn also produced a series of commercial soundtracks for the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy, including one directed by Jean-Luc Godard, a long-term Zorn inspiration. Zorn used his film commissions to record new ensembles like Masada and the Masada String Trio. From the mid-1990s, Zorn composed film music for independent films dealing with BDSM and LGBT culture, documentaries exploring the Jewish experience, and films about outsider artists. In 2013, after releasing 25 volumes in his Filmworks Series, Zorn announced that he would no longer be releasing music for film.

=== Hardcore: Naked City, Painkiller and beyond ===
Zorn established Naked City in 1988 as a &quot;compositional workshop&quot; to test the limitations of a rock band format. Featuring Zorn (saxophone), Bill Frisell (guitars), Fred Frith (bass), Wayne Horvitz (keyboards), Joey Baron (drums), and vocalist Yamatsuka Eye (and later Mike Patton), Naked City blended Zorn&#x27;s appreciation of hardcore punk and grindcore bands like Agnostic Front and Napalm Death with influences like film music, country or jazz often in a single composition. The band performed pieces by film composers Ennio Morricone, John Barry, Johnny Mandel and Henry Mancini and modern classicists Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen and recorded heavy metal and ambient albums.

In 1991, Zorn formed Painkiller with Bill Laswell on bass and Mick Harris on drums. Painkiller&#x27;s first two releases, &quot;Guts of a Virgin&quot; (1991) and &quot;Buried Secrets&quot; (1992), also featured short grindcore and free jazz-inspired compositions. They released their first live album, &quot;&quot;, in 1993, followed by the double CD &quot;Execution Ground&quot; (1994), which featured longer dub and ambient-styled pieces. A second live album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2002 and the band was featured on Zorn&#x27;s &quot;50th Birthday Celebration Volume 12&quot; (2005) with Hamid Drake replacing Harris on drums and guest vocalist Mike Patton.

Both bands attracted worldwide interest, particularly in Japan, where Zorn had relocated following a three-month residency in Tokyo.
In 2006, Zorn formed the voice/bass/drums trio of Mike Patton, Trevor Dunn, and Joey Baron as &quot;a compositional challenge, as a song cycle, songs without words&quot; as he decided &quot;I want to work with Patton more; Patton was very hungry to do more work together. ‘OK, so let&#x27;s start it with just bass, drums, and voice&quot;. Rolling Stone said Moonchild was &quot;a band that, much like Naked City, mutated radically across its lifespan as Zorn kept raising his compositional bar. While it touched on similar extremes as that group... its episodes are more sustained, its structures more conventionally songlike&quot; noting &quot;For the first five of Moonchild&#x27;s seven albums, released from 2006 through 2014, Patton utilized his full whisper-to-scream range while operating entirely without lyrics&quot;.

===Concert music===
As Zorn&#x27;s interest in Naked City waned, he &quot;started hearing classical music in [his] head again.&quot; Zorn started working on compositions that drew on chamber music arrangements of strings, percussion and electronic instruments. &quot;Elegy&quot;, a suite dedicated to Jean Genet, was released in 1992.

The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn&#x27;s earliest released classical composition, &quot;Christabel&quot; (1972) for five flutes, first appeared on &quot;Angelus Novus&quot; in 1998. He credits the composition of his 1988 string quartet &quot;Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; (commissioned and released by the Kronos Quartet on &quot;Short Stories&quot;) to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition also appeared on &quot;The String Quartets&quot; (1999) and &quot;Cartoon S/M&quot; (2000) along with variations on &quot;Kol Nidre&quot;, inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written at the same time as the first Masada Book.

&quot;&quot; (1998) was Zorn&#x27;s first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children&#x27;s Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.

Much of Zorn&#x27;s classical work is dedicated or inspired by artists who have influenced him: 
* &quot;&quot; (1997) contains tributes to Marguerite Duras and Olivier Messiaen
* &quot;Songs from the Hermetic Theatre&quot; (2001) features compositions dedicated to Harry Smith, Joseph Beuys, and Maya Deren
* &quot;Madness, Love and Mysticism&quot; (2001) featured &quot;Le Mômo&quot;, inspired by Antonin Artaud, and &quot;Untitled&quot;, dedicated to Joseph Cornell
* &quot;Chimeras&quot; (2001) was based on Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s atonal composition, &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;
Several of Zorn&#x27;s later concert works drew inspiration from mysticism and the works of Aleister Crowley in particular; &quot;Magick&quot; (2004) featured a group called the Crowley Quartet. A 2009 performance of the album&#x27;s centerpiece &quot;Necronomicon&quot; was described as &quot;... frenetic vortexes of violent, abrasive motion, separated by eerily becalmed, suspenseful sections with moody, even prayerful melodies. The music is sensational and evocative, but never arbitrary; you always sense a guiding hand behind the mayhem&quot;.

Later works expanded to include vocal and operatic works; &quot;Mysterium&quot; released in 2005 featured &quot;Frammenti del Sappho&quot; for female chorus; &quot;Rituals&quot; (2005) featured Zorn&#x27;s opera composed for the Bayreuth Opera Festival in 1998; and &quot;La Machine de l&#x27;Être&quot; composed in 2000, premiered at the New York City Opera in 2011, and recorded for the 2012 album &quot;Music and Its Double&quot;.

Zorn&#x27;s concert works have been performed all over the world and he has received commissions from the New York Philharmonic, Brooklyn Philharmonic and BBC Radio 3.

===Masada books===
Conversations with Joey Baron led Zorn to explore and embrace Jewish culture. A further file-card composition &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (1992) reflected on the Night of Broken Glass that violently and destructively targeted Jews in Germany and Austria in 1938.
Several movements used the Phrygian dominant and Ukrainian Dorian scales common to klezmer music. Zorn set himself the task of writing 100 compositions using the scale within a year.

==== Book One ====
In 1993 Zorn engaged Baron along with Dave Douglas (trumpet) and Greg Cohen (double bass) to provide musical cues for Joe Chappelle&#x27;s first film &quot;Thieves Quartet&quot; (later collected on &quot;Filmworks III: 1990–1995&quot;) and established the first Masada group to perform his recent compositions using the instrumental lineup and improvisational approach of Ornette Coleman&#x27;s pioneering free jazz quartet.

Within three years, the number of compositions had grown to 205 and became known as the first Masada Book. Zorn explained:

In 1996, Zorn released &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot; featuring Masada compositions recorded by a rotating group of musicians. Two ensembles arose from this album: the Masada String Trio, composed of Greg Cohen (bass), Mark Feldman (violin), and Erik Friedlander (cello); and the Bar Kokhba Sextet which added Marc Ribot (guitar), Cyro Baptista (percussion), and Joey Baron (drums), both of which were featured on 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Circle Maker&quot;. The Masada String Trio were also featured on Zorn&#x27;s Filmworks series, as part of his 50th Birthday Celebration, and released two albums as part of the Book of Angels project, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 2003, Zorn formed Electric Masada, a band featuring Zorn, Baptista, Baron, and Ribot, along with Trevor Dunn (bass), Ikue Mori (electronics), Jamie Saft (keyboards), and Kenny Wollesen (drums) releasing their debut live album from Zorn&#x27;s 50th Birthday Concert series and a double live CD recorded in 2004. In 2019, Zorn formed the New Masada Quartet with Julian Lage (guitar), Jorge Roeder (bass), and Kenny Wollesen (drums).

A Tenth Anniversary Series of Masada recordings was released by Zorn beginning in 2003. The series featured five albums of Masada themes including &quot;Masada Guitars&quot; by Marc Ribot, Bill Frisell, and Tim Sparks; &quot;Masada Recital&quot; by Mark Feldman and Sylvie Courvoisier; &quot;Masada Rock&quot; by Rashanim; and two albums featuring various artists, &quot;Voices in the Wilderness&quot; and &quot;The Unknown Masada&quot;.
==== Book Two ====
In 2004, Zorn began composing the second Masada Book, &quot;The Book of Angels&quot;, resulting in an additional 316 compositions. Zorn explained:

Zorn released thirty-two volumes of Masada Book Two compositions performed by many varied artists. The titles of many Masada Book Two compositions are derived from demonology and Judeo-Christian mythology.

The Masada quartet performed at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in March 2007 for what were billed as their final concerts. Zorn reformed the band as a sextet with Uri Caine and Cyro Baptista in 2009 saying:

Zorn&#x27;s Masada compositions and associated ensembles have become a central focus of many concerts and festivals and he has established regular &#x27;Masada Marathons&#x27; that feature various bands and musicians performing music from the Masada Books.

==== Book Three ====
Zorn completed the third Masada book, titled &quot;The Book Beriah&quot;, in 2014.

===The Dreamers===
Zorn released one of his most popular albums, &quot;The Gift&quot;, in 2001, which surprised many with its relaxed blend of surf, exotica and world music. On February 29, 2008, at St Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, Zorn premiered &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, which saw a return to the gentle compositions first featured on &quot;The Gift&quot; and established the band of the same name. The Dreamers released their second album, &quot;O&#x27;o&quot;, in 2009, an album of Zorn&#x27;s in 2010 and a Christmas album in 2011.

== Other work ==
=== Tzadik Records ===
In 1992, John Zorn curated the Avant subsidiary of the DIW label with jazz producer Kazunori Sugiyama and released several Naked City recordings on the label as well as many other albums featuring Zorn affiliated musicians including Derek Bailey, Dave Douglas, Erik Friedlander, and Marc Ribot.

In 1995, Zorn established the Tzadik label, allowing him to record and release his continually expanding catalog and works by others. Zorn stated &quot;I do feel that it’s a lot easier to keep your head clear from greed if you’re not involved with major corporations. When I was working with Nonesuch for a short period, I got wrapped up with the same shit of like, “Why does Bill Frisell have a bigger budget than me?” I mean like, that’s something to think about? I could feel greed growing in me like a cancer. And for me, it’s very hard to deal with..&quot;

The label&#x27;s releases are divided into series:
* The &quot;Archival Series&quot; features Zorn&#x27;s recordings exclusively, including re-releases of several albums that appeared on other labels, Zorn&#x27;s film work, and recordings from 1973 onwards;

* The &quot;Radical Jewish Culture Series&quot; features contemporary Jewish musicians;

* The &quot;Film Music Series&quot; features soundtracks by other musicians (Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Filmworks&quot; recordings are featured in the &quot;Archival Series&quot;);
* The &quot;Oracle Series&quot; promotes women in experimental music;
* The &quot;Key Series&quot; presents notable avant-garde musicians and projects;
* The &quot;Lunatic Fringe Series&quot; releases music and musicians operating outside of the broad categories offered by other series; and

Tzadik also releases special-edition CDs, DVDs, books and T-shirts. Since 1998, the designs of Tzadik releases have been created by graphic artist Heung-Heung &quot;Chippy&quot; Chin.

=== The Stone (music venue) ===
Zorn&#x27;s earliest New York performances occurred at small artist-run performance spaces including his own apartment. As his profile grew, he became associated with several Lower East Side alternative venues such as the Knitting Factory and Tonic. On Friday April 13, 2007, Zorn played the final night at Tonic before it closed due to financial pressures.

Zorn was the principal force in establishing The Stone in 2005, an avant-garde performance space in New York&#x27;s Alphabet City which supports itself solely on donations and the sale of limited-edition CDs, giving all door revenues directly to the performers. Zorn holds the title of artistic director and regularly performs &#x27;Improvisation Nights&#x27;. Zorn feels that &quot;The Stone is a unique space and is different from Tonic, the Knitting Factory, and most of the other venues we have played at as there is no bar ... so there is NO pressure to pack the house with an audience that drinks, and what night you perform has nothing to do with your power to draw a crowd or what kind of music you might play&quot;. On January 10, 2008, Zorn performed with Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson at a special benefit night at The Stone which was also released on &quot;The Stone: Issue Three&quot; on CD. In December 2016 Zorn announced that The Stone would close in February 2018 but that he was hopeful that a new location could be found, stating &quot;Venues come and go, but the music continues on forever!&quot; By March 2017 Zorn had negotiated with The New School to move The Stone to Greenwich Village. On February 25, 2018, the last performance was held at the original venue and Zorn moved operations to The New School&#x27;s The Glass Box Theatre on the basis of a handshake deal.

===50th and 60th birthday concert series===
In September 2003, Zorn celebrated his 50th birthday with a month-long series of performances at Tonic in New York, repeating an event he had begun a decade earlier at the Knitting Factory. He conceptualized the month into several different aspects of his musical output. Zorn&#x27;s bands performed on the weekends, classical ensembles were featured on Sundays, Zorn performed improvisations with other musicians on Mondays, featured his extended compositions on Tuesdays and a retrospective of game pieces on Wednesdays. A total of 12 live albums were released on his 50th Birthday Celebration Series.

Zorn&#x27;s 60th birthday celebrations encompassed concerts across the globe from festival appearances to unique events in art galleries and unusual venues across 2013 and into 2014. The first concerts under the Zorn@60 banner were performed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in April 2013. This was followed by performances at the Museum of Modern Art and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The European leg of Zorn@60 commenced at the Barbican Theatre in London in July 2013. Festival appearances in Belgium, Poland, Spain and Germany followed soon after. These were followed by concerts in Victoriaville, Canada. Returning to New York City other concert appearances occurred at Alice Tully Hall and Lincoln Centre.

Zorn undertook another of his celebrated Masada Marathons at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in August. Further New York City concerts in September included performances of music for film at the Anthology Film Archives, classical works and &quot;Cobra&quot; at the Miller Theatre, a day-long concert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a performance of improvised duets with Ryuichi Sakamoto. In October, the International Contemporary Ensemble performed a retrospective of Zorn&#x27;s classical music at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. The final Zorn@60 concerts were performed as part of the Adelaide Festival in Australia in March 2014 featuring a four concerts covering the breadth of his compositional and improvisational range.

===&quot;Arcana&quot; (book series)===
In 2000, Zorn edited the book &quot;Arcana: Musicians on Music&quot; featuring interviews, essays, and commentaries by musicians including Anthony Coleman, Peter Garland, David Mahler, Bill Frisell, Gerry Hemingway, George E. Lewis, Fred Frith, Eyvind Kang, Mike Patton and Elliott Sharp, on the compositional process. Zorn released the second volume of &quot;Arcana: Musicians on Music&quot; in the summer of 2007. According to the preface by Zorn, &quot;This second installment of what will be a continuing series of books presenting radical, cutting-edge ideas about music is made, like the initial volume, out of necessity.&quot; New volumes have since been released; the eighth volume was published in September 2017.

===In other media===
Zorn also appeared on the 1985 Henry Hills film &quot;Money&quot; about the financial struggles of Manhattan avant garde artists during the age of Reaganism.

==Awards==
In 2001, John Zorn received the Jewish Cultural Award in Performing Arts from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. In 2006, Zorn was named a MacArthur Fellow. In 2007, he was the recipient of Columbia University&#x27;s School of the Arts William Schuman Award, an honor given &quot;to recognize the lifetime achievement of an American composer whose works have been widely performed and generally acknowledged to be of lasting significance.&quot;

In 2011, Zorn was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame by Lou Reed, and was awarded the Magister Artium Gandensis, an honorary degree from the University of Ghent. In 2014, he received honorary doctorates from The State University of New York and the New England Conservatory of Music.
