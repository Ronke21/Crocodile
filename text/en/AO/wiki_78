<text>Johann Heinrich Lambert (; ; 26 or 28 August 1728 – 25 September 1777) was a polymath from the Republic of Mulhouse, generally identified as either Swiss or French, who made important contributions to the subjects of mathematics, physics (particularly optics), philosophy, astronomy and map projections.

==Biography==
Lambert was born in 1728 into a Huguenot family in the city of Mulhouse (now in Alsace, France), at that time a city-state allied to the Swiss Confederacy. Some sources give 26 August as his birth date and others 28 August. Leaving school at 12, he continued to study in his free time while undertaking a series of jobs. These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of &quot;Basler Zeitung&quot; and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in Chur. Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1763) by an invitation to a position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of Frederick II of Prussia, and became a friend of Euler. In this stimulating and financially stable environment, he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777.

== Work ==

===Mathematics===
Lambert was the first to introduce hyperbolic functions into trigonometry. Also, he made conjectures about non-Euclidean space. Lambert is credited with the first proof that π is irrational using a generalized continued fraction for the function tan x. Euler believed the conjecture but could not prove that π was irrational, and it is speculated that Aryabhata also believed this, in 500 CE. Lambert also devised theorems about conic sections that made the calculation of the orbits of comets simpler.

Lambert devised a formula for the relationship between the angles and the area of hyperbolic triangles. These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a saddle, instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles added up to less than π (radians), or 180°. The defect (amount of shortfall) increases with area. The larger the triangle&#x27;s area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect C△ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the curvature of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is by definition negative). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of similar hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of the area of the triangle&#x27;s being expressed in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclidean geometry, the area of Lambert&#x27;s hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles.

===Map projection===
Lambert was the first mathematician to address the general properties of map projections (of a spherical Earth). In particular he was the first to discuss the properties of conformality and equal area
preservation and to point out that they were mutually exclusive.
(Snyder 1993 p77). In 1772, Lambert published
seven new map projections under the title &quot;Anmerkungen und Zusätze zur Entwerfung der Land- und Himmelscharten&quot;, (translated as &quot;Notes and Comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps&quot; by Waldo Tobler (1972)).
Lambert did not give names to any of his projections but they are now known as:
# Lambert conformal conic
# Transverse Mercator
# Lambert azimuthal equal area
# Lagrange projection
# Lambert cylindrical equal area
# Transverse cylindrical equal area
# Lambert conical equal area
The first three of these are of great importance. Further details may be found at map projections and in several texts.

===Physics===
Lambert invented the first practical hygrometer. In 1760, he published a book on photometry, the &quot;Photometria&quot;. From the assumption that light travels in straight lines, he showed that illumination was proportional to the strength of the source, inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the illuminated surface and the sine of the angle of inclination of the light&#x27;s direction to that of the surface. These results were supported by experiments involving the visual comparison of illuminations and used for the calculation of illumination. In &quot;Photometria&quot; Lambert also cited a law of light absorption, formulated earlier by Pierre Bouguer he is mistakenly credited for (the Beer–Lambert law) and introduced the term &quot;albedo&quot;. Lambertian reflectance is named after him. He wrote a classic work on perspective and contributed to geometrical optics.

The non-SI unit of luminance, lambert, is named in recognition of his work in establishing the study of photometry. Lambert was also a pioneer in the development of three-dimensional colour models. Late in life, he published a description of a triangular colour pyramid (&quot;Farbenpyramide&quot;), which shows a total of 107 colours on six different levels, variously combining red, yellow and blue pigments, and with an increasing amount of white to provide the vertical component. His investigations were built on the earlier theoretical proposals of Tobias Mayer, greatly extending these early ideas. Lambert was assisted in this project by the court painter Benjamin Calau.

=== Logic and philosophy ===
In his main philosophical work, &quot;Neues Organon&quot; (&quot;New Organon&quot;, 1764, named after Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;), Lambert studied the rules for distinguishing subjective from objective appearances, connecting with his work in optics. The &quot;Neues Organon&quot; contains one of the first appearances of the term &quot;phenomenology&quot;, and it includes a presentation of the various kinds of syllogism. According to John Stuart Mill, 

A modern edition of the &quot;Neues Organon&quot; was published in 1990 by the Akademie-Verlag of Berlin.

In 1765 Lambert began corresponding with Immanuel Kant. Kant intended to dedicate the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; to Lambert, but the work was delayed, appearing after Lambert&#x27;s death.

=== Astronomy ===
Lambert also developed a theory of the generation of the universe that was similar to the nebular hypothesis that Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant had (independently) developed. Wright published his account in &quot;An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe&quot; (1750), Kant in &quot;Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels&quot;, published anonymously in 1755. Shortly afterward, Lambert published his own version of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System in &quot;Cosmologische Briefe über die Einrichtung des Weltbaues&quot; (1761). Lambert hypothesized that the stars near the Sun were part of a group which travelled together through the Milky Way, and that there were many such groupings (star systems) throughout the galaxy. The former was later confirmed by Sir William Herschel. In astrodynamics he also solved the problem of determination of time of flight along a section of orbit, known now as Lambert&#x27;s problem. His work in this area is commemorated by the Asteroid 187 Lamberta named in his honour.

=== Meteorology ===
Lambert propounded the ideology of observing periodic phenomena first, try to derive their rules and then gradually expand the theory. He expressed his purpose in meteorology as follows:
To obtain more and better data of meteorology, Lambert proposed to establish a network of weather stations around the world, in which the various weather configurations (rain, clouds, dry ...) would be recorded – the methods that are still used nowadays. He also devoted himself to the improvement of the measuring instruments and accurate concepts for the advancement of meteorology. This results in his published works in 1769 and 1771 on hygrometry and hygrometers.

<doc id="93088" wikidata="Q162719" url="?curid=93088" title="Neoliberalism">
<text>Neoliberalism is both a political philosophy and a term used to signify the late-20th-century political reappearance of 19th-century ideas associated with free-market capitalism. The term has multiple, competing definitions, and is often used pejoratively. In scholarly use, the term is often left undefined or used to describe a multitude of phenomena; however, it is primarily employed to delineate the societal transformation resulting from market-based reforms.

Neoliberalism is an economic philosophy that originated among European liberal scholars during the 1930s. It emerged as a response to the perceived decline in popularity of classical liberalism, which was seen as giving way to a social liberal desire to control markets. This shift in thinking was shaped by the Great Depression and manifested in policies designed to counter the volatility of free markets. One motivation for the development of policies designed to mitigate the volatility of capitalist free markets was a desire to avoid repeating the economic failures of the early 1930s, which have been attributed, in part, to the economic policy of classical liberalism. In the context of policymaking, &quot;neoliberalism&quot; is often used to describe a paradigm shift that followed the failure of the post-war consensus and neo-Keynesian economics to address the stagflation of the 1970s. The collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War also facilitated the rise of neoliberalism in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.

&quot;Neoliberalism&quot; has become an increasingly prevalent term in recent decades. It has been a significant factor in the proliferation of conservative and right-libertarian organizations, political parties, and think tanks, and predominantly advocated by them. Neoliberalism is often associated with a set of economic liberalization policies, including privatization, deregulation, depoliticisation, consumer choice, globalization, free trade, monetarism, austerity, and reductions in government spending. These policies are designed to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society. Additionally, the neoliberal project is oriented towards the establishment of institutions and is inherently political in nature, extending beyond mere economic considerations.

The term is rarely used by proponents of free-market policies. When the term entered into common academic use during the 1980s in association with Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s economic reforms in Chile, it quickly acquired negative connotations and was employed principally by critics of market reform and laissez-faire capitalism. Scholars tended to associate it with the theories of economists working with the Mont Pelerin Society, including Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises, and James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Alan Greenspan. Once the new meaning of neoliberalism became established as common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy. By 1994, the term entered global circulation and scholarship about it has grown over the last few decades.

== Terminology ==

=== Origins ===
An early use of the term in English was in 1898 by the French economist Charles Gide to describe the economic beliefs of the Italian economist Maffeo Pantaleoni, with the term previously existing in French; the term was later used by others, including the classical liberal economist Milton Friedman in his 1951 essay &quot;Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects&quot;. In 1938, at the Colloque Walter Lippmann, &quot;neoliberalism&quot; was proposed, among other terms, and ultimately chosen to be used to describe a certain set of economic beliefs. The colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as involving &quot;the priority of the price mechanism, free enterprise, the system of competition, and a strong and impartial state&quot;. According to attendees Louis Rougier and Friedrich Hayek, the competition of neoliberalism would establish an elite structure of successful individuals that would assume power in society, with these elites replacing the existing representative democracy acting on the behalf of the majority. To be &quot;neoliberal&quot; meant advocating a modern economic policy with state intervention. Neoliberal state interventionism brought a clash with the opposing &quot;laissez-faire&quot; camp of classical liberals, like Ludwig von Mises. Most scholars in the 1950s and 1960s understood neoliberalism as referring to the social market economy and its principal economic theorists such as Walter Eucken, Wilhelm Röpke, Alexander Rüstow, and Alfred Müller-Armack. Although Hayek had intellectual ties to the German neoliberals, his name was only occasionally mentioned in conjunction with neoliberalism during this period due to his more pro-free market stance.

During the military rule under Augusto Pinochet (1973–1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression to describe the economic reforms implemented there and its proponents (the Chicago Boys). Once this new meaning was established among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy. According to one study of 148 scholarly articles, neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It has become used largely as a term of abuse and/or to imply a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; market fundamentalism virtually identical to that of classical liberalism – rather than the ideas of those who attended the 1938 colloquium. As a result, there is controversy as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the social sciences, especially as the number of different kinds of market economies have proliferated in recent years.

Unrelated to the economic philosophy, &quot;neoliberalism&quot; is used to describe a centrist political movement from modern American liberalism in the 1970s. According to political commentator David Brooks, prominent neoliberal politicians included Al Gore and Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party. The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, &quot;The New Republic&quot; and the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, and often supported Third Way policies. The &quot;godfather&quot; of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist Charles Peters, who in 1983 published &quot;A Neoliberal&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;.

=== Current usage ===
Historian Elizabeth Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left-leaning academics in the 1970s to &quot;describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policymakers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies&quot;; economic historian Phillip W. Magness notes its reemergence in academic literature in the mid-1980s, after French philosopher Michel Foucault brought attention to it.

&quot;Neoliberalism&quot; is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as &quot;eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers&quot; and reducing, especially through privatization and austerity, state influence in the economy. It is also commonly associated with the economic policies introduced by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States. Some scholars note it has a number of distinct usages in different spheres:

* As a development model, it refers to the rejection of structuralist economics in favor of the Washington Consensus.
* As an ideology, it denotes a conception of freedom as an overarching social value associated with reducing state functions to those of a minimal state.
* As a public policy, it involves the privatization of public economic sectors or services, the deregulation of private corporations, sharp decrease of government budget deficits and reduction of spending on public works.

There is debate over the meaning of the term. Sociologists Fred L. Block and Margaret Somers claim there is a dispute over what to call the influence of free-market ideas which have been used to justify the retrenchment of New Deal programs and policies since the 1980s: neoliberalism, &quot;laissez-faire&quot; or &quot;free market ideology&quot;. Other academics such as Susan Braedley, Med Luxton, and Robert W. McChesney, assert that neoliberalism is a political philosophy which seeks to &quot;liberate&quot; the processes of capital accumulation. In contrast, Frances Fox Piven sees neoliberalism as essentially hyper-capitalism. Robert W. McChesney, while defining neoliberalism similarly as &quot;capitalism with the gloves off&quot;, goes on to assert that the term was largely unknown by the general public in 1998, particularly in the United States. Lester Spence uses the term to critique trends in Black politics, defining neoliberalism as &quot;the general idea that society works best when the people and the institutions within it work or are shaped to work according to market principles&quot;. According to Philip Mirowski, neoliberalism views the market as the greatest information processor, superior to any human being. It is hence considered as the arbiter of truth. Adam Kotsko describes neoliberalism as political theology, as it goes beyond simply being a formula for an economic policy agenda and instead infuses it with a moral ethos that &quot;aspires to be a complete way of life and a holistic worldview, in a way that previous models of capitalism did not.&quot;

Neoliberalism is distinct from liberalism insofar as it does not advocate &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic policy, but instead is highly constructivist and advocates a strong state to bring about market-like reforms in every aspect of society. Anthropologist Jason Hickel also rejects the notion that neoliberalism necessitates the retreat of the state in favor of totally free markets, arguing that the spread of neoliberalism required substantial state intervention to establish a global &#x27;free market&#x27;. Naomi Klein states that the three policy pillars of neoliberalism are &quot;privatization of the public sphere, deregulation of the corporate sector, and the lowering of income and corporate taxes, paid for with cuts to public spending&quot;.

Neoliberalism has a history of being used as a pejorative by critics. Additionally, Neoliberalism has outpaced similar terms such as monetarism, neoconservatism, the Washington Consensus and &quot;market reform&quot; in scholarly writing. &quot;The Handbook of Neoliberalism&quot;, for instance, posits that the term has &quot;become a means of identifying a seemingly ubiquitous set of market-oriented policies as being largely responsible for a wide range of social, political, ecological and economic problems&quot;. Its use in this manner has been criticized by those who advocate for policies characterized as neoliberal. The &quot;Handbook&quot;, for example, further argues that &quot;such lack of specificity [for the term] reduces its capacity as an analytic frame. If neoliberalism is to serve as a way of understanding the transformation of society over the last few decades, then the concept is in need of unpacking.&quot; Historian Daniel Stedman Jones has similarly said that the term &quot;is too often used as a catch-all shorthand for the horrors associated with globalization and recurring financial crises&quot;. 

Several writers have criticized &quot;neoliberal&quot; as an insult or slur used by leftists against liberals and varieties of liberalism that leftists disagree with. British journalist Will Hutton called neoliberal &quot;an unthinking leftist insult&quot; that &quot;stifle[s] debate.&quot; On the other hand, many scholars believe it retains a meaningful definition. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Stephen Metcalf posits that the publication of the 2016 IMF paper &quot;Neoliberalism: Oversold?&quot; helps &quot;put to rest the idea that the word is nothing more than a political slur, or a term without any analytic power&quot;. Gary Gerstle argues that neoliberalism is a legitimate term, and describes it as &quot;a creed that calls explicitly for unleashing capitalism&#x27;s power.&quot; He distinguishes neoliberalism from traditional conservatism, as the latter values respect for traditions and bolstering the institutions which reinforce them, whereas the former seeks to disrupt and overcome any institutions which stand in the way.

Radhika Desai, director of the Geopolitical Economy Research Group at the University of Manitoba, argues that global capitalism reached its peak in 1914, just prior to the two great wars, anti-capitalist revolutions and Keynesian reforms, and the purpose of neoliberalism was to restore capitalism to the preeminence it once enjoyed. She argues that this process has failed as contemporary neoliberal capitalism has fostered a &quot;slowly unfolding economic disaster&quot; and bequeathed to the world increased inequalities, societal divisions, economic misery and a lack of meaningful politics.

== Early history ==

=== Walter Lippmann Colloquium ===

The Great Depression in the 1930s, which severely decreased economic output throughout the world and produced high unemployment and widespread poverty, was widely regarded as a failure of economic liberalism. To renew the damaged ideology, a group of 25 liberal intellectuals, including a number of prominent academics and journalists like Walter Lippmann, Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Wilhelm Röpke, Alexander Rüstow, and Louis Rougier, organized the Walter Lippmann Colloquium, named in honor of Lippmann to celebrate the publication of the French translation of Lippmann&#x27;s pro-market book &quot;An Inquiry into the Principles of the Good Society&quot;. Meeting in Paris in August 1938, they called for a new liberal project, with &quot;neoliberalism&quot; one name floated for the fledgling movement. They further agreed to develop the Colloquium into a permanent think tank based in Paris called the Centre International d&#x27;Études pour la Rénovation du Libéralisme.

While most agreed that the &quot;status quo&quot; liberalism promoting &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics had failed, deep disagreements arose around the proper role of the state. A group of &quot;true (third way) neoliberals&quot; centered around Rüstow and Lippmann advocated for strong state supervision of the economy while a group of old school liberals centered around Mises and Hayek continued to insist that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Rüstow wrote that Hayek and Mises were relics of the liberalism that caused the Great Depression while Mises denounced the other faction, complaining that the ordoliberalism they advocated really meant &quot;ordo-interventionism&quot;.

Divided in opinion and short on funding, the Colloquium was mostly ineffectual; related attempts to further neoliberal ideas, such as the effort by Colloque-attendee Wilhelm Röpke to establish a journal of neoliberal ideas, mostly floundered. Fatefully, the efforts of the Colloquium would be overwhelmed by the outbreak of World War II and were largely forgotten. Nonetheless, the Colloquium served as the first meeting of the nascent neoliberal movement and would serve as the precursor to the Mont Pelerin Society, a far more successful effort created after the war by many of those who had been present at the Colloquium.

=== Mont Pelerin Society ===
Neoliberalism began accelerating in importance with the establishment of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, whose founding members included Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Karl Popper, George Stigler and Ludwig von Mises. Meeting annually, it became a &quot;kind of international &#x27;who&#x27;s who&#x27; of the classical liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals.&quot; While the first conference in 1947 was almost half American, the Europeans dominated by 1951. Europe would remain the epicenter of the community as Europeans dominated the leadership roles.

Established during a time when central planning was in the ascendancy worldwide and there were few avenues for neoliberals to influence policymakers, the society became a &quot;rallying point&quot; for neoliberals, as Milton Friedman phrased it, bringing together isolated advocates of liberalism and capitalism. They were united in their belief that individual freedom in the developed world was under threat from collectivist trends, which they outlined in their statement of aims:
The central values of civilization are in danger. Over large stretches of the Earth&#x27;s surface the essential conditions of human dignity and freedom have already disappeared. In others, they are under constant menace from the development of current tendencies of policy. The position of the individual and the voluntary group are progressively undermined by extensions of arbitrary power. Even that most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened by the spread of creeds which, claiming the privilege of tolerance when in the position of a minority, seek only to establish a position of power in which they can suppress and obliterate all views but their own...The group holds that these developments have been fostered by the growth of a view of history which denies all absolute moral standards and by the growth of theories which question the desirability of the rule of law. It holds further that they have been fostered by a decline of belief in private property and the competitive market...[This group&#x27;s] object is solely, by facilitating the exchange of views among minds inspired by certain ideals and broad conceptions held in common, to contribute to the preservation and improvement of the free society.

The society set out to develop a neoliberal alternative to, on the one hand, the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic consensus that had collapsed with the Great Depression and, on the other, New Deal liberalism and British social democracy, collectivist trends which they believed posed a threat to individual freedom. They believed that classical liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws which could only be diagnosed and rectified by withdrawing into an intensive discussion group of similarly minded intellectuals; however, they were determined that the liberal focus on individualism and economic freedom must not be abandoned to collectivism.

== Post–World War II neoliberal currents ==
For decades after the formation of the Mont Pelerin Society, the ideas of the society would remain largely on the fringes of political policy, confined to a number of think-tanks and universities and achieving only measured success with the ordoliberals in Germany, who maintained the need for strong state influence in the economy. It would not be until a succession of economic downturns and crises in the 1970s that neoliberal policy proposals would be widely implemented. By this time, neoliberal thought had evolved. The early neoliberal ideas of the Mont Pelerin Society had sought to chart a middle way between the trend of increasing government intervention implemented after the Great Depression and the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics many in the society believed had produced the Great Depression. Milton Friedman, wrote in his early essay &quot;Neo-liberalism and Its Prospects&quot; that &quot;Neo-liberalism would accept the nineteenth-century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would substitute for the nineteenth century goal of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive order&quot;, which requires limited state intervention to &quot;police the system, establish conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework, and relieve acute misery and distress.&quot; By the 1970s, neoliberal thought—including Friedman&#x27;s—focused almost exclusively on market liberalization and was adamant in its opposition to nearly all forms of state interference in the economy.

One of the earliest and most influential turns to neoliberal reform occurred in Chile after an economic crisis in the early 1970s. After several years of socialist economic policies under president Salvador Allende, a 1973 coup d&#x27;état, which established a military junta under dictator Augusto Pinochet, led to the implementation of a number of sweeping neoliberal economic reforms that had been proposed by the Chicago Boys, a group of Chilean economists educated under Milton Friedman. This &quot;neoliberal project&quot; served as &quot;the first experiment with neoliberal state formation&quot; and provided an example for neoliberal reforms elsewhere. Beginning in the early 1980s, the Reagan administration and Thatcher government implemented a series of neoliberal economic reforms to counter the chronic stagflation the United States and United Kingdom had each experienced throughout the 1970s. Neoliberal policies continued to dominate American and British politics until the Great Recession. Following British and American reform, neoliberal policies were exported abroad, with countries in Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and China implementing significant neoliberal reform. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank encouraged neoliberal reforms in many developing countries by placing reform requirements on loans, in a process known as structural adjustment.

=== Germany ===
Neoliberal ideas were first implemented in West Germany. The economists around Ludwig Erhard drew on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contributed to West Germany&#x27;s reconstruction after the Second World War. Erhard was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and that he accepted this classification.

The ordoliberal Freiburg School was more pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity. However, they argued that a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; state policy stifles competition, as the strong devour the weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian employment policies or an extensive welfare state, German neoliberal theory was marked by the willingness to place humanistic and social values on par with economic efficiency. Alfred Müller-Armack coined the phrase &quot;social market economy&quot; to emphasize the egalitarian and humanistic bent of the idea. According to Boas and Gans-Morse, Walter Eucken stated that &quot;social security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time&quot;.

Erhard emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not need to be made so. He hoped that growing prosperity would enable the population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of &quot;Volkskapitalismus&quot;, there were some efforts to foster private savings. Although average contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German population, therefore despite liberal rhetoric the 1950s witnessed what has been called a &quot;reluctant expansion of the welfare state&quot;. To end widespread poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under Otto von Bismarck. Rüstow, who had coined the label &quot;neoliberalism&quot;, criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare program.

Hayek did not like the expression &quot;social market economy&quot;, but stated in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using that phrase. In Hayek&#x27;s view, the social market economy&#x27;s aiming for both a market economy and social justice was a muddle of inconsistent aims. Despite his controversies with the German neoliberals at the Mont Pelerin Society, Ludwig von Mises stated that Erhard and Müller-Armack accomplished a great act of liberalism to restore the German economy and called this &quot;a lesson for the US&quot;. According to different research Mises believed that the ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwig&#x27;s complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the ordoliberals, Mises wrote: &quot;I have no illusions about the true character of the politics and politicians of the social market economy&quot;. According to Mises, Erhard&#x27;s teacher Franz Oppenheimer &quot;taught more or less the New Frontier line of&quot; President Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Harvard consultants (Schlesinger, Galbraith, etc.)&quot;.

In Germany, neoliberalism at first was synonymous with both ordoliberalism and social market economy. But over time the original term neoliberalism gradually disappeared since social market economy was a much more positive term and fit better into the (economic miracle) mentality of the 1950s and 1960s.

=== Latin America ===
In the 1980s, numerous governments in Latin America adopted neoliberal policies.

==== Chile ====

Chile was among the earliest nations to implement neoliberal reform. Marxist economic geographer David Harvey has described the substantial neoliberal reforms in Chile beginning in the 1970s as &quot;the first experiment with neoliberal state formation&quot;, which would provide &quot;helpful evidence to support the subsequent turn to neoliberalism in both Britain... and the United States.&quot; Similarly, Vincent Bevins says that Chile under Augusto Pinochet &quot;became the world&#x27;s first test case for &#x27;neoliberal&#x27; economics.&quot;

The turn to neoliberal policies in Chile originated with the Chicago Boys, a select group of Chilean students who, beginning in 1955, were invited to the University of Chicago to pursue postgraduate studies in economics. They studied directly under Milton Friedman and his disciple, Arnold Harberger, and were exposed to Friedrich Hayek. Upon their return to Chile, their neoliberal policy proposals—which centered on widespread deregulation, privatization, reductions to government spending to counter high inflation, and other free-market policies—would remain largely on the fringes of Chilean economic and political thought for a number of years, as the presidency of Salvador Allende (1970–1973) brought about a socialist reorientation of the economy.

During the Allende presidency, Chile experienced a severe economic crisis, in which inflation peaked near 150%. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension, as well as diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure from the United States, the Chilean armed forces and national police overthrew the Allende government in a coup d&#x27;état. They established a repressive military &quot;junta&quot;, known for its violent suppression of opposition, and appointed army chief Augusto Pinochet Supreme Head of the nation. His rule was later given legal legitimacy through a controversial 1980 plebiscite, which approved a new constitution drafted by a government-appointed commission that ensured Pinochet would remain as president for a further eight years—with increased powers—after which he would face a re-election referendum.

The Chicago Boys were given significant political influence within the military dictatorship, and they implemented sweeping economic reform. In contrast to the extensive nationalization and centrally planned economic programs supported by Allende, the Chicago Boys implemented rapid and extensive privatization of state enterprises, deregulation, and significant reductions in trade barriers during the latter half of the 1970s. In 1978, policies that would further reduce the role of the state and infuse competition and individualism into areas such as labor relations, pensions, health and education were introduced. Additionally, the central bank raised interest rates from 49.9% to 178% to counter high inflation.

These policies amounted to a shock therapy, which rapidly transformed Chile from an economy with a protected market and strong government intervention into a liberalized, world-integrated economy, where market forces were left free to guide most of the economy&#x27;s decisions. Inflation was tempered, falling from over 600% in 1974, to below 50% by 1979, to below 10% right before the economic crisis of 1982; GDP growth spiked (see chart) to 10%. however, inequality widened as wages and benefits to the working class were reduced.

In 1982, Chile again experienced a severe economic recession. The cause of this is contested but most scholars believe the Latin American debt crisis—which swept nearly all of Latin America into financial crisis—was a primary cause. Some scholars argue the neoliberal policies of the Chicago boys heightened the crisis (for instance, percent GDP decrease was higher than in any other Latin American country) or even caused it; for instance, some scholars criticize the high interest rates of the period which—while stabilizing inflation—hampered investment and contributed to widespread bankruptcy in the banking industry. Other scholars fault governmental departures from the neoliberal agenda; for instance, the government pegged the Chilean peso to the US dollar, against the wishes of the Chicago Boys, which economists believe led to an overvalued peso.

After the recession, Chilean economic growth rose quickly, eventually hovering between 5% and 10% and significantly outpacing the Latin American average (see chart). Additionally, unemployment decreased and the percent of the population below the poverty line declined from 50% in 1984 to 34% by 1989. This led Milton Friedman to call the period the &quot;Miracle of Chile&quot;, and he attributed the successes to the neoliberal policies of the Chicago boys. Some scholars attribute the successes to the re-regulation of the banking industry and a number of targeted social programs designed to alleviate poverty. Others say that while the economy had stabilized and was growing by the late 1980s, inequality widened: nearly 45% of the population had fallen into poverty while the wealthiest 10% had seen their incomes rise by 83%. According to Chilean economist Alejandro Foxley, when Pinochet finished his 17-year term by 1990, around 44% of Chilean families were living below the poverty line.

Despite years of suppression by the Pinochet junta, a presidential election was held in 1988, as dictated by the 1980 constitution (though not without Pinochet first holding another plebiscite in an attempt to amend the constitution). In 1990, Patricio Aylwin was democratically elected, bringing an end to the military dictatorship. The reasons cited for Pinochet&#x27;s acceptance of democratic transition are numerous. Hayek, echoing arguments he had made years earlier in &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; argued that the increased economic freedom he believed the neoliberal reforms had brought had put pressure on the dictatorship over time, resulting in a gradual increase in political freedom and, ultimately, the restoration of democracy. The Chilean scholars Javier Martínez and Alvaro Díaz reject this argument, pointing to the long tradition of democracy in Chile. They assert that the defeat of the Pinochet regime and the return of democracy came primarily from large-scale mass rebellion that eventually forced party elites to use existing institutional mechanisms to restore democracy.

In the 1990s, neoliberal economic policies broadened and deepened, including unilateral tariff reductions and the adoption of free trade agreements with a number of Latin American countries and Canada. At the same time, the decade brought increases in government expenditure on social programs to tackle poverty and poor quality housing. Throughout the 1990s, Chile maintained high growth, averaging 7.3% from 1990 to 1998. Eduardo Aninat, writing for the IMF journal &quot;Finance &amp; Development&quot;, called the period from 1986 to 2000 &quot;the longest, strongest, and most stable period of growth in [Chile&#x27;s] history.&quot; In 1999, there was a brief recession brought about by the Asian financial crisis, with growth resuming in 2000 and remaining near 5% until the Great Recession.

In sum, the neoliberal policies of the 1980s and 1990s—initiated by a repressive authoritarian government—transformed the Chilean economy from a protected market with high barriers to trade and hefty government intervention into one of the world&#x27;s most open free-market economies. Chile experienced the worst economic bust of any Latin American country during the Latin American debt crisis (several years into neoliberal reform), but also had one of the most robust recoveries, rising from the poorest Latin American country in terms of GDP per capita in 1980 (along with Peru) to the richest in 2019. Average annual economic growth from the mid-1980s to the Asian crisis in 1997 was 7.2%, 3.5% between 1998 and 2005, and growth in per capita real income from 1985 to 1996 averaged 5%—all outpacing Latin American averages. Inflation was brought under control. Between 1970 and 1985 the infant mortality rate in Chile fell from 76.1 per 1000 to 22.6 per 1000, the lowest in Latin America. Unemployment from 1980 to 1990 decreased, but remained higher than the South American average (which was stagnant). And despite public perception among Chileans that economic inequality has increased, Chile&#x27;s Gini coefficient has in fact dropped from 56.2 in 1987 to 46.6 in 2017. While this is near the Latin American average, Chile still has one of the highest Gini coefficients in the OECD, an organization of mostly developed countries that includes Chile but not most other Latin American countries. Furthermore, the Gini coefficient measures only income inequality; Chile has more mixed inequality ratings in the OECD&#x27;s Better Life Index, which includes indexes for more factors than only income, like housing and education. Additionally, the percentage of the Chilean population living in poverty rose from 17% in 1969 to 45% in 1985 at the same time government budgets for education, health and housing dropped by over 20% on average. The era was also marked by economic instability.

Overall, scholars have mixed opinions on the effects of the neoliberal reforms. The CIA World Factbook states that Chile&#x27;s &quot;sound economic policies&quot;, maintained consistently since the 1980s, &quot;have contributed to steady economic growth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates,&quot; and some scholars have even called the period the &quot;Miracle of Chile&quot;. Other scholars have called it a failure that led to extreme inequalities in the distribution of income and resulted in severe socioeconomic damage. It is also contested how much these changes were the result of neoliberal economic policies and how much they were the result of other factors; in particular, some scholars argue that after the Crisis of 1982 the &quot;pure&quot; neoliberalism of the late 1970s was replaced by a focus on fostering a social market economy that mixed neoliberal and social welfare policies.

As a response to the 2019–20 Chilean protests, a national plebiscite was held in October 2020 to decide whether the Chilean constitution would be rewritten. The &quot;approve&quot; option for a new constitution to replace the Pinochet-era constitution, which entrenched certain neoliberal principles into the country&#x27;s basic law, won with 78% of the vote. However, in September 2022, the referendum to approve a rewritten the constitution was rejected with 61% of the vote.

==== Peru ====

Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, the founder of one of the first neoliberal organizations in Latin America, Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), began to receive assistance from Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration, with the National Endowment for Democracy&#x27;s Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) providing his ILD with funding. The economic policy of President Alan García distanced Peru from international markets, resulting in lower foreign investment in the country. Under García, Peru experienced hyperinflation and increased confrontations with the guerrilla group Shining Path, leading the country towards high levels of instability. The Peruvian armed forces grew frustrated with the inability of the García administration to handle the nation&#x27;s crises and began to draft an operation – Plan Verde – to overthrow his government.

The military&#x27;s Plan Verde involved the &quot;total extermination&quot; of impoverished and indigenous Peruvians perceived as a drain on the economy, the control or censorship of media in the nation and the establishment of a neoliberal economy in Peru. During his campaigning for the 1990 Peruvian general election, Alberto Fujimori initially expressed concern against the proposed neoliberal policies of his opponent Mario Vargas Llosa. Peruvian magazine &quot;Oiga&quot; reported that, following the election, the armed forces were unsure of Fujimori&#x27;s willingness to fulfill the plan&#x27;s objectives, though they planned to convince Fujimori to agree to the operation prior to his inauguration. After taking office, Fujimori abandoned his campaign&#x27;s economic platform, adopting more aggressive neoliberal policies than those espoused by his election competitor Vargas Llosa. With Fujimori&#x27;s compliance, plans for a coup as designed in Plan Verde were prepared for two years and finally executed during the 1992 Peruvian coup d&#x27;état, which ultimately established a civilian-military regime.

Shortly after the inauguration of Fujimori, his government received a $715 million grant from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on 29 September 1990 for the Policy Analysis, Planning and Implementation Project (PAPI) that was developed &quot;to support economic policy reform in the country&quot;. De Soto proved to be influential to Fujimori, who began to repeat de Soto&#x27;s advocacy for deregulating the Peruvian economy. Under Fujimori, de Soto served as &quot;the President&#x27;s personal representative&quot;, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing de Soto as an &quot;overseas salesman&quot;, while others dubbed de Soto as the &quot;informal president&quot; for Fujimori. In a recommendation to Fujimori, de Soto called for a &quot;shock&quot; to Peru&#x27;s economy. The policies included a 300% tax increase, unregulated prices and privatizing two-hundred and fifty state-owned entities. The policies of de Soto led to the immediate suffering of poor Peruvians who saw unregulated prices increase rapidly. Those living in poverty saw prices increase so much that they could no longer afford food. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that de Soto advocated for the collapse of Peru&#x27;s society, with the economist saying that a civil crisis was necessary to support the policies of Fujimori. Fujimori and de Soto would ultimately break their ties after de Soto recommended increased involvement of citizens within the government, which was received with disapproval by Fujimori. USAID would go on to assist the Fujimori government with rewriting the 1993 Peruvian constitution, with the agency concluding in 1997 that it helped with the &quot;preparation of legislative texts&quot; and &quot;contributed to the emergence of a private sector advisory role&quot;. The policies promoted by de Soto and implemented by Fujimori eventually caused macroeconomic stability and a reduction in the rate of inflation, though Peru&#x27;s poverty rate remained largely unchanged with over half of the population living in poverty in 1998.

According to the Foundation for Economic Education, USAID, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Nippon Foundation also supported the sterilization efforts of the Fujimori government. E. Liagin reported that from 1993 to 1998, USAID &quot;basically took charge of the national health system of Peru&quot; during the period of forced sterilizations. At least 300,000 Peruvians were victims of forced sterilization by the Fujimori government in the 1990s, with the majority being affected by the PNSRPF. The policy of sterilizations resulted in a generational shift that included a smaller younger generation that could not provide economic stimulation to rural areas, making such regions more impoverished.

Though economic statistics show improved economic data in Peru in recent decades, the wealth earned between 1990 and 2020 was not distributed throughout the country; living standards showed disparities between the more-developed capital city of Lima and similar coastal regions while rural provinces remained impoverished. Sociologist Maritza Paredes of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru stated, &quot;People see that all the natural resources are in the countryside but all the benefits are concentrated in Lima.&quot; In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compounded these disparities, with political scientist Professor Farid Kahhat of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru stating that, &quot;market reforms in Peru have yielded positive results in terms of reducing poverty ... But what the pandemic has laid bare, particularly in Peru, is that poverty was reduced while leaving the miserable state of public services unalteredmost clearly in the case of health services.&quot; The candidacy of Pedro Castillo in the 2021 Peruvian general election brought attention to the disparities between urban and rural Peruvians, with much of his support being earned in the exterior portions of the country. Castillo ultimately won the election, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporting his victory as the &quot;clearest repudiation of the country&#x27;s establishment&quot;.

==== Argentina ====

In the 1960s, Latin American intellectuals began to notice the ideas of ordoliberalism; they often used the Spanish term &quot;neoliberalismo&quot; to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly impressed by the social market economy and the Wirtschaftswunder (&quot;economic miracle&quot;) in Germany and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar policies in their own countries. Neoliberalism in 1960s Argentina meant a philosophy that was more moderate than entirely Laissez-faire free-market capitalism and favored using state policy to temper social inequality and counter a tendency towards monopoly.

In 1976, the military dictatorship&#x27;s economic plan led by José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz was the first attempt at establishing a neoliberal program in Argentina. They implemented a fiscal austerity plan that reduced money printing in an attempt to counter inflation. In order to achieve this, salaries were frozen; however, they were unable to reduce inflation, which led to a drop in the real salary of the working class. They also liberalized trade policy so that foreign goods could freely enter the country. Argentina&#x27;s industry, which had been on the rise for 20 years after the economic policies of former president Arturo Frondizi, rapidly declined as it was not able to compete with foreign goods. Following the measures, there was an increase in poverty from 9% in 1975 to 40% at the end of 1982.

From 1989 to 2001, more neoliberal policies were implemented by Domingo Cavallo. This time, the privatization of public services was the main focus, although financial deregulation and free trade with foreign nations were also re-implemented. Along with an increased labour market flexibility, the unemployment rate dropped to 18.3%. Public perception of the policies was mixed; while some of the privatization was welcomed, much of it was criticized for not being in the people&#x27;s best interests. Protests resulted in the death of 29 people at the hands of police.

==== Mexico ====
Along with many other Latin American countries in the early 1980s, Mexico experienced a debt crisis. In 1983 the Mexican government ruled by the PRI, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, accepted loans from the IMF. Among the conditions set by the IMF were requirements for Mexico to privatize state-run industries, devalue their currency, decrease trade barriers, and restrict governmental spending. These policies were aimed at stabilizing Mexico&#x27;s economy in the short run. Later, Mexico tried to expand these policies to encourage growth and foreign direct investment (FDI).

The decision to accept the IMF&#x27;s neoliberal reforms split the PRI between those on the right who wanted to implement neoliberal policies and those the left who did not. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took power in 1988, doubled down on neoliberal reforms. His policies opened up the financial sector by deregulating the banking system and privatizing commercial banks. Though these policies did encourage a small amount of growth and FDI, the growth rate was below what it had been under previous governments in Mexico, and the increase in foreign investment was largely from existing investors. 

On 1 January 1994 the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, named for Emiliano Zapata, a leader in the Mexican revolution, launched an armed rebellion against the Mexican government in the Chiapas region. Among their demands were rights for indigenous Mexicans as well as opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which solidified a strategic alliance between state and business.  NAFTA, a trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, significantly aided in Mexico&#x27;s efforts to liberalize trade.

In 1994, the same year of the Zapatista rebellion and the enactment of NAFTA, Mexico faced a financial crisis. The crisis, also known as the &quot;Tequila Crisis&quot; began in December 1994 with the devaluation of the peso. When investors&#x27; doubts led to negative speculation they fled with their capital. The central bank was forced to raise interest rates which in turn collapsed the banking system as borrowers could no longer pay back their loans.

After Salinas, Ernesto Zedillo (1995–2000) maintained similar economic policies to his predecessor. Despite the crisis, Zedillo continued to enact neoliberal policies and signed new agreements with the World Bank and the IMF. As a result of these policies and the 1994 recession, Mexico&#x27;s economy did gain stability. Neither the 2001 or 2008 recessions were caused by internal economic forces in Mexico. Trade increased dramatically, as well as FDI; however, as Mexico&#x27;s business cycle synced with that of the United States, it was much more vulnerable to external economic pressures. FDI benefited the Northern and Central regions of Mexico while the Southern region was largely excluded from the influx of investment. The crisis also left the banks mainly in the hands of foreigners.

The PRI&#x27;s 71-year rule ended when Vicente Fox of the PAN, the National Action Party, won the election in 2000. Fox and his successor, Felipe Calderón, did not significantly diverge from the economic policies of the PRI governments. They continued to privatize the financial system and encourage foreign investment. Despite significant opposition, Enrique Peña Nieto, president from 2012 to 2018, pushed through legislation that would privatize the oil and electricity industries. These reforms marked the conclusion to the neoliberal goals that had been envisioned in Mexico in the 1980s.

==== Brazil ====

Brazil adopted neoliberal policies in the late 1980s, with support from the worker&#x27;s party on the left. For example, tariff rates were cut from 32% in 1990 to 14% in 1994. During this period, Brazil effectively ended its policy of maintaining a closed economy focused on import substitution industrialization in favor of a more open economic system with a much higher degree of privatization. The market reforms and trade reforms ultimately resulted in price stability and a faster inflow of capital but had little effect on income inequality and poverty. Consequently, mass protests continued during the period.

During her tenure as Conservative Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, Margaret Thatcher oversaw a number of neoliberal policies, including tax reduction, exchange rate reform, deregulation, and privatisation. These policies were continued and supported by her successor John Major. Although opposed by the Labour Party, the policies were, according to some scholars, largely accepted and left unaltered when Labour returned to power in 1997 during the New Labour era under Tony Blair.

The Adam Smith Institute, a United Kingdom–based free-market think tank and lobbying group formed in 1977 which was a major driver of the aforementioned neoliberal policies, officially changed its libertarian label to neoliberal in October 2016.

According to economists Denzau and Roy, the &quot;shift from Keynesian ideas toward neoliberalism influenced the fiscal policy strategies of New Democrats and New Labour in both the White House and Whitehall... Reagan, Thatcher, Clinton, and Blair all adopted broadly similar neoliberal beliefs.&quot;

=== United States ===

While a number of recent histories of neoliberalism in the United States have traced its origins back to the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, Marxist economic geographer David Harvey argues the rise of neoliberal policies in the United States occurred during the 1970s energy crisis, and traces the origin of its political rise to Lewis Powell&#x27;s 1971 confidential memorandum to the Chamber of Commerce in particular. A call to arms to the business community to counter criticism of the free enterprise system, it was a significant factor in the rise of conservative and libertarian organizations and think-tanks which advocated for neoliberal policies, such as the Business Roundtable, The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Accuracy in Academia and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. For Powell, universities were becoming an ideological battleground, and he recommended the establishment of an intellectual infrastructure to serve as a counterweight to the increasingly popular ideas of Ralph Nader and other opponents of big business. The original neoliberals included, among others, Michael Kinsley, Charles Peters, James Fallows, Nicholas Lemann, Bill Bradley, Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart, and Paul Tsongas. Sometimes called &quot;Atari Democrats&quot;, these were the men who helped to remake American liberalism into neoliberalism, culminating in the election of Bill Clinton in 1992. These new liberals disagreed with the policies and programs of mid-century figures like progressive labor organizer Walter Reuther, economist John Kenneth Galbraith or even noted historian Arthur Schlesinger.

Early roots of neoliberalism were laid in the 1970s during the Nixon administration, with appointment of associates of Milton Friedman to Departments of Treasury, Agriculture and Justice, and the Council of Economic Advisors and encouraged funding of the American Enterprise Institute and defunding of the more centrist Brookings Institution, and during the Carter administration, with deregulation of the trucking, banking and airline industries, the appointment of Paul Volcker to chairman of the Federal Reserve as well as increased military spending at the end of his term leading to fiscal austerity in US nonmilitary budget diverting funds away from social programs. This trend continued into the 1980s under the Reagan administration, which included tax cuts, increased defense spending, financial deregulation and trade deficit expansion. Likewise, concepts of supply-side economics, discussed by the Democrats in the 1970s, culminated in the 1980 Joint Economic Committee report &quot;Plugging in the Supply Side&quot;. This was picked up and advanced by the Reagan administration, with Congress following Reagan&#x27;s basic proposal and cutting federal income taxes across the board by 25% in 1981.

The Clinton administration embraced neoliberalism by supporting the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), continuing the deregulation of the financial sector through passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act and implementing cuts to the welfare state through passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. The American historian Gary Gerstle writes that while Reagan was the ideological architect of the neoliberal order which was formulated in the 1970s and 1980s, it was Clinton who was its key facilitator, and as such this order achieved dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. The neoliberalism of the Clinton administration differs from that of Reagan as the Clinton administration purged neoliberalism of neoconservative positions on militarism, family values, opposition to multiculturalism and neglect of ecological issues. Writing in &quot;New York&quot;, journalist Jonathan Chait disputed accusations that the Democratic Party had been hijacked by neoliberals, saying that its policies have largely stayed the same since the New Deal. Instead, Chait suggested these accusations arose from arguments that presented a false dichotomy between free-market economics and socialism, ignoring mixed economies. American feminist philosopher Nancy Fraser says the modern Democratic Party has embraced a &quot;progressive neoliberalism&quot;, which she describes as a &quot;progressive-neoliberal alliance of financialization plus emancipation&quot;. Historian Walter Scheidel says that both parties shifted to promote free-market capitalism in the 1970s, with the Democratic Party being &quot;instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s&quot;. Historians Andrew Diamond and Thomas Sugrue argue that neoliberalism became a &quot;&#x27;dominant rationality&#x27; precisely because it could not be confined to a single partisan identity.&quot; Economic and political inequalities in schools, universities, and libraries and an undermining of democratic and civil society institutions influenced by neoliberalism has been explored by Buschman.

=== Asia-Pacific ===
Scholars who emphasized the key role of the developmental state in the early period of fast industrialization in East Asia in the late 19th century now argue that South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have transformed from developmental to close-to-neoliberal states. Their arguments are matter of scholarly debate.

==== China ====

Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, Deng Xiaoping led the country through far ranging market-centered reforms, with the slogan of Xiǎokāng, that combined neoliberalism with centralized authoritarianism. These focused on agriculture, industry, education and science/defense.

Experts debate the extent to which traditional Maoist communist doctrines have been transformed to incorporate the new neoliberal ideas. In any case, the Chinese Communist Party remains a dominant force in setting economic and business policies. Throughout the 20th century, Hong Kong was the outstanding neoliberal exemplar inside China.

==== Taiwan ====
Taiwan exemplifies the impact of neoliberal ideas. The policies were pushed by the United States but were not implemented in response to a failure of the national economy, as in numerous other countries.

==== Japan ====

Neoliberal policies were at the core of the leading party in Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), after 1980. These policies had the effect of abandoning the traditional rural base and emphasizing the central importance of the Tokyo industrial-economic region. Neoliberal proposals for Japan&#x27;s agricultural sector called for reducing state intervention, ending the protection of high prices for rice and other farm products, and exposing farmers to the global market. The 1993 Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations opened up the rice market. Neoconservative leaders called for the enlargement, diversification, intensification, and corporatization of the farms receiving government subsidies. In 2006, the ruling LDP decided to no longer protect small farmers with subsidies. Small operators saw this as favoritism towards big corporate agriculture and reacted politically by supporting the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), helping to defeat the LDP in nationwide elections.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, neoliberalism had the effect of strengthening the national government&#x27;s control over economic policies. These policies were popular to the extent that they weakened the historically very powerful chaebol family-owned conglomerates.

==== India ====
In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014 with a commitment to implement neoliberal economic policies. This commitment would shape national politics and foreign affairs and put India in a race with China and Japan for economic supremacy in East Asia.

==== Australia ====
In Australia, neoliberal economic policies (known at the time as &quot;economic rationalism&quot; or &quot;economic fundamentalism&quot;) have been embraced by governments of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party since the 1980s. The Labor governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating from 1983 to 1996 pursued a program of economic reform focused on economic liberalisation. These governments privatised government corporations, deregulated factor markets, floated the Australian dollar and reduced trade protections. Another key policy was the accords which was an agreement with unions to agree to a reduction in strikes, wage demands and a real wage cut in exchange for the implementation of social policies, such as Medicare and superannuation. The Howard government continued these policies, whilst also acting to reduce union power, cut welfare and reduce government spending.

Keating, building on policies he had introduced while federal treasurer, implemented a compulsory superannuation guarantee system in 1992 to increase national savings and reduce future government liability for old age pensions. The financing of universities was deregulated, requiring students to contribute to university fees through a repayable loan system known as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and encouraging universities to increase income by admitting full-fee-paying students, including foreign students. The admission of domestic full-fee-paying students to public universities was abolished in 2009 by the Rudd Labor government.

Immigration to the mainland capitals by refugees have seen capital flows follow soon after, such as from war-torn Lebanon and Vietnam. Later economic migrants from mainland China also, up to recent restrictions, had invested significantly in the property markets.

==== New Zealand ====

In New Zealand, neoliberal economic policies were implemented under the Fourth Labour Government led by Prime Minister David Lange. These neoliberal policies are commonly referred to as Rogernomics, a portmanteau of &quot;Roger&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;, after Lange appointed Roger Douglas minister of finance in 1984.

Lange&#x27;s government had inherited a severe balance of payments crisis as a result of the deficits from the previously implemented two-year freeze on wages and prices by preceding Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, who had also maintained an exchange rate many economists now believe was unsustainable. The inherited economic conditions lead Lange to remark &quot;We ended up being run very similarly to a Polish shipyard.&quot; On 14 September 1984, Lange&#x27;s government held an Economic Summit to discuss the underlying problems with New Zealand&#x27;s economy, which lead to calls for dramatic economic reforms previously proposed by the Treasury Department.

A reform program consisting of deregulation and the removal of tariffs and subsidies was put in place. This had an immediate effect on New Zealand&#x27;s agricultural community, who were hit hard by the loss of subsidies to farmers. A superannuation surcharge was introduced, despite having promised not to reduce superannuation, resulting in Labour losing support from the elderly. The financial markets were also deregulated, removing restrictions on interests rates, lending and foreign exchange. In March 1985, the New Zealand dollar was floated. Additionally, a number of government departments were converted into state-owned enterprises, which lead to significant job losses: 3,000 within the Electricity Corporation; 4,000 within the Coal Corporation; 5,000 within the Forestry Corporation; and 8,000 within the New Zealand Post.

New Zealand became a part of the global economy. The focus in the economy shifted from the productive sector to finance as a result of zero restrictions on overseas money coming into the country. Finance capital outstripped industrial capital and the manufacturing industry suffered approximately 76,000 job losses.

=== Middle East ===
Beginning in the late 1960s, a number of neoliberal reforms were implemented in the Middle East. For instance, Egypt is frequently linked to the implementation of neoliberal policies, particularly with regard to the &#x27;open-door&#x27; policies of President Anwar Sadat throughout the 1970s, and Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s successive economic reforms between 1981 and 2011. These measures, known as &quot;al-Infitah&quot;, were later diffused across the region. In Tunisia, neoliberal economic policies are associated with former president and &quot;de facto&quot; dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali; his reign made it clear that economic neoliberalism can coexist and even be encouraged by authoritarian states. Responses to globalisation and economic reforms in the Gulf have also been approached via a neoliberal analytical framework.

=== International organizations ===

The adoption of neoliberal policies in the 1980s by international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank had a significant impact on the spread of neoliberal reform worldwide. To obtain loans from these institutions, developing or crisis-wracked countries had to agree to institutional reforms, including privatization, trade liberalization, enforcement of strong private property rights, and reductions to government spending. This process became known as structural adjustment, and the principles underpinning it the Washington Consensus.

=== European Union ===

The European Union (EU), created in 1992, is sometimes considered a neoliberal organization, as it facilitates free trade and freedom of movement, erodes national protectionism and limits national subsidies. Others underline that the EU is not completely neoliberal as it leaves the development of welfare policies to its constituent states.

== Traditions ==
=== Austrian School ===

The Austrian School is a school of economic thought originating in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with a strong focus around the faculty of the University of Vienna. It bases its study of economic phenomena on the interpretation and analysis of the purposeful actions of individuals. In the 21st century, the term has increasingly been used to denote the free-market economics of Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek, including their criticisms of government intervention in the economy, which has tied the school to neoliberal thought.

Economists associated with the school, including Carl Menger, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises, have been responsible for many notable contributions to economic theory, including the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory, Friedrich von Wieser&#x27;s theories on opportunity cost, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s theories on time preference, the formulation of the economic calculation problem, as well as a number of criticisms of Marxian economics. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000 that &quot;the Austrian School have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in [the United States]&quot;.

=== Chicago School ===

The Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of thought within the academic community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of the University of Chicago. Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations. The school is strongly associated with University of Chicago economists such as Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Ronald Coase and Gary Becker. In the 21st century, economists such as Mark Skousen refer to Friedrich Hayek as a key economist who influenced this school in the 20th century having started his career in Vienna and the Austrian school of economics.

The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient, with the exception of the regulation of the money supply by central banks (in the form of monetarism). Although the school&#x27;s association with neoliberalism is sometimes resisted by its proponents, its emphasis on reduced government intervention in the economy and a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; ideology have brought about an affiliation between the Chicago school and neoliberal economics.

=== Washington Consensus ===
The Washington Consensus is a set of standardized policy prescriptions often associated with neoliberalism that were developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the US Department of Treasury for crisis-wracked developing countries. These prescriptions, often attached as conditions for loans from the IMF and World Bank, focus on market liberalization, and in particular on lowering barriers to trade, controlling inflation, privatizing state-owned enterprises, and reducing government budget deficits. John Williamson, a British-born economist defined the Washington Consensus by making in 1989 10 rules that were imposed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the US government on developing nations. He came to strongly oppose the way those recommendations were actually imposed and their use by neoliberals.

=== Geneva School ===
Historian Quinn Slobodian proposed in 2018 the existence of a so-called Geneva School of economics to describe a group of economists and political economists who gravitated in the 1920s and 1930s around the Geneva Graduate Institute, and the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and League of Nations. The particular strand of political philosophy revolved around renowned economists such as Friedrich von Hayek, Wilhelm Röpke, Jacob Viner, as well as Gottfried Haberler. Slobodian describes them as &quot;ordo-globalists&quot; who promoted the creation of global institutions to safeguard the unimpeded movement of capital across borders. He argues the school combined the &quot;Austrian emphasis on the limits of knowledge and the global scale with the German ordoliberal emphasis on institutions and the moment of the political decision.&quot;

== Political policy aspects ==
Neoliberal policies center around economic liberalization, including reductions to trade barriers and other policies meant to increase free trade, deregulation of industry, privatization of state-owned enterprises, reductions in government spending, and monetarism. Neoliberal theory contends that free markets encourage economic efficiency, economic growth, and technological innovation. State intervention, even if aimed at encouraging these phenomena, is generally believed to worsen economic performance.

=== Economic and political freedom ===
Many neoliberal thinkers advance the view that economic and political freedom are inextricably linked. Milton Friedman argued in his book &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component of absolute freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He claimed that centralized control of economic activities is always accompanied by political repression. In his view, the voluntary character of all transactions in an unregulated market economy and the wide diversity of choices that it permits pose fundamental threats to repressive political leaders by greatly diminishing their power to coerce people economically. Through the elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power and each can serve as a counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity. In &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, Friedrich Hayek offered a similar argument: &quot;Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends&quot;.

=== Free trade ===

A central feature of neoliberalism is the support of free trade, and policies that enable free trade, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, are often associated with neoliberalism. Neoliberals argue that free trade promotes economic growth, reduces poverty, produces gains of trade like lower prices as a result of comparative advantage, maximizes consumer choice, and is essential to freedom, as they believe voluntary trade between two parties should not be prohibited by government. Relatedly, neoliberals argue that protectionism is harmful to consumers, who will be forced to pay higher prices for goods; incentivizes individuals to misuse resources; distorts investment; stifles innovation; and props up certain industries at the expense of consumers and other industries.

=== Monetarism ===

Monetarism is an economic theory commonly associated with neoliberalism. Formulated by Milton Friedman, it focuses on the macroeconomic aspects of the supply of money, paying particular attention to the effects of central banking. It argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently inflationary and that monetary authorities should focus primarily on maintaining price stability, even at the cost of other macroeconomic factors like economic growth.

Monetarism is often associated with the policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of economist Paul Volcker, which centered around high interest rates that are widely credited with ending the high levels of inflation seen in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s as well as contributing to the 1980–1982 recession. Monetarism had particular force in Chile, whose central bank raised interest rates to counter inflation that had spiraled to over 600%. This helped to successfully reduce inflation to below 10%, but also resulted in job losses.

== Criticism ==
Neoliberalism has faced criticism by academics, journalists, religious leaders, and activists from both the political left and right. Notable critics of neoliberalism in theory or practice include economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, Michael Hudson, Ha-Joon Chang, Robert Pollin, Thomas Piketty, and Richard D. Wolff; linguist Noam Chomsky; geographer and anthropologist David Harvey; Slovenian continental philosopher Slavoj Žižek, political activist and public intellectual Cornel West; Marxist feminist Gail Dines; British musician and political activist Billy Bragg; author, activist and filmmaker Naomi Klein; head of the Catholic Church Pope Francis; journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot; Belgian psychologist Paul Verhaeghe; journalist and activist Chris Hedges; conservative philosopher Roger Scruton; and the alter-globalization movement, including groups such as ATTAC. The impact of the Great Recession in 2008 also gave rise to a surge in new scholarship that criticized neoliberalism.

=== Market fundamentalism ===
Neoliberal thought has been criticized for supposedly having an undeserved &quot;faith&quot; in the efficiency of markets, in the superiority of markets over centralized economic planning, in the ability of markets to self-correct, and in the market&#x27;s ability to deliver economic and political freedom. Economist Paul Krugman has argued that the &quot;laissez-faire absolutism&quot; promoted by neoliberals &quot;contributed to an intellectual climate in which faith in markets and disdain for government often trumps the evidence&quot;. Political theorist Wendy Brown has gone even further and asserted that the overriding objective of neoliberalism is &quot;the economization of all features of life&quot;. A number of scholars have argued that, in practice, this &quot;market fundamentalism&quot; has led to a neglect of social goods not captured by economic indicators, an erosion of democracy, an unhealthy promotion of unbridled individualism and social Darwinism, and economic inefficiency.

Some critics contend neoliberal thinking prioritizes economic indicators like GDP growth and inflation over social factors that might not be easy to quantify, like labor rights and access to higher education. This focus on economic efficiency can compromise other, perhaps more important, factors, or promote exploitation and social injustice. For example, anthropologist Mark Fleming argues that when the performance of a transit system is assessed purely in terms of economic efficiency, social goods such as strong workers&#x27; rights are considered impediments to maximum performance. He supports this assertion with a case study of the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), which is one of the slowest major urban transit systems in the US and has one of the worst on-time performance rates. This poor performance, he contends, stems from structural problems including an aging fleet and maintenance issues. He argues that the neoliberal worldview singled out transit drivers and their labor unions, blaming drivers for failing to meet impossible transit schedules and considering additional costs to drivers as lost funds that reduce system speed and performance. This produced vicious attacks on the drivers&#x27; union and brutal public smear campaigns, ultimately resulting in the passing of Proposition G, which severely undermined the powers of the Muni drivers&#x27; union.

American scholar and cultural critic Henry Giroux alleges that neoliberal market fundamentalism fosters a belief that market forces should organize every facet of society, including economic and social life, and promotes a social Darwinist ethic that elevates self-interest over social needs. Giroux states that the United States has entered a Second Gilded Age &quot;more savage and anti-democratic than its predecessor&quot; as a result of the enforcement of neoliberal policies and adherence to market fundamentalist principles. Marxist economic geographer David Harvey argues that neoliberalism promotes an unbridled individualism that is harmful to social solidarity.

While proponents of economic liberalization have often pointed out that increasing economic freedom tends to raise expectations on political freedom, some scholars see the existence of non-democratic yet market-liberal regimes and the seeming undermining of democratic control by market processes as evidence that this characterization is ahistorical. Some scholars contend that neoliberal focuses may even undermine the basic elements of democracy. Kristen Ghodsee, ethnographer at the University of Pennsylvania, asserts that the triumphalist attitudes of Western powers at the end of the Cold War and the fixation on linking all leftist political ideals with the excesses of Stalinism, permitted neoliberal, free-market capitalism to fill the void, which undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment and rising economic inequality throughout the former Eastern Bloc and much of the West that fueled a resurgence of extremist nationalism. Costas Panayotakis has argued that the economic inequality engendered by neoliberalism creates inequality of political power, undermining democracy and the citizen&#x27;s ability to meaningfully participate.

Despite the focus on economic efficiency, some critics allege that neoliberal policies actually produce economic inefficiencies. The replacement of a government-owned monopoly with privately owned companies might reduce the efficiencies associated with economies of scale. Structurally, some economists argue that neoliberalism is a system that socializes costs and privatizes profits. They argue this results in an abdication of private responsibility for socially destructive economic choices and may result in regressive governmental controls on the economy to reduce damages by private individuals.

American political theologian Adam Kotsko argues that contemporary right-wing populism, exemplified by Brexit and the Trump Administration, represent a &quot;heretical&quot; variant of neoliberalism, which accepts its core tenets but pushes them to new, almost &quot;parodic&quot; extremes.

=== Inequality ===
Critics have argued that neoliberal policies have increased economic inequality and exacerbated global poverty. The Center for Economic and Policy Research&#x27;s (CEPR) Dean Baker argued in 2006 that the driving force behind rising inequality in the United States has been a series of deliberate neoliberal policy choices, including anti-inflationary bias, anti-unionism and profiteering in the healthcare industry. The economists David Howell and Mamadou Diallo contend that neoliberal policies have contributed to a United States economy in which 30% of workers earn low wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers) and 35% of the labor force is underemployed while only 40% of the working-age population in the country is adequately employed. The globalization of neoliberalism has been blamed for the emergence of a &quot;precariat&quot;, a new social class facing acute socio-economic insecurity and alienation. In the United States, the &quot;neoliberal transformation&quot; of industrial relations, which considerably diminished the power of unions and increased the power of employers, has been blamed by many for increasing precarity, which could be responsible for as many as 120,000 excess deaths per year. In Venezuela, prior to the Venezuelan crisis, deregulation of the labor market resulted in greater informal employment and a considerable increase in industrial accidents and occupational diseases. Even in Sweden, in which only 6% of workers are beset with wages the OECD considers low, some scholars argue that the adoption of neoliberal reforms—in particular the privatization of public services and the reduction of state benefits—is the reason it has become the nation with the fastest growing income inequality in the OECD.
A 2016 report by researchers at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was critical of neoliberal policies for increasing economic inequality. While the report included praise for neoliberalism, saying &quot;there is much to cheer in the neoliberal agenda,&quot; it noted that certain neoliberal policies, particularly freedom of capital and fiscal consolidation, resulted in &quot;increasing inequality&quot;, which &quot;in turn jeopardized durable [economic] expansion&quot;. The report contends that the implementation of neoliberal policies by economic and political elites has led to &quot;three disquieting conclusions&quot;:
* The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.
* The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.
* Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.

A number of scholars see increasing inequality arising out of neoliberal policies as a deliberate effort, rather than a consequence of ulterior motives like increasing economic growth. Marxist economic geographer David Harvey describes neoliberalism as a &quot;class project&quot; &quot;carried out by the corporate capitalist class&quot;, and argued in his book &quot;A Brief History of Neoliberalism&quot; that neoliberalism is designed to increase the class power of economic elites. Economists Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy posit that &quot;the restoration and increase of the power, income, and wealth of the upper classes&quot; are the primary objectives of the neoliberal agenda. Economist David M. Kotz contends that neoliberalism &quot;is based on the thorough domination of labor by capital&quot;. Similarly, Elizabeth S. Anderson writes that neoliberalism has &quot;shifted economic and political power to private businesses, executives, and the very rich&quot; and that &quot;more and more, these organizations and individuals govern everyone else.&quot; Sociologist Thomas Volscho argues that the imposition of neoliberalism in the United States arose from a conscious political mobilization by capitalist elites in the 1970s, who faced two self-described crises: the legitimacy of capitalism and a falling rate of profitability in industry. In &quot;The Global Gamble&quot;, Peter Gowan argued that &quot;neoliberalism&quot; was not only a free-market ideology but &quot;a social engineering project&quot;. Globally, it meant opening a state&#x27;s political economy to products and financial flows from the core countries. Domestically, neoliberalism meant the remaking of social relations &quot;in favour of creditor and rentier interests, with the subordination of the productive sector to financial sectors, and a drive to shift wealth, power and security away from the bulk of the working population.&quot;

According to Jonathan Hopkin, the United States took the lead in implementing the neoliberal agenda in the 1980s, making it &quot;the most extreme case of the subjection of society to the brute force of the market.&quot; As such, he argues this made the United States an outlier with economic inequality hitting &quot;unprecedented levels for the rich democracies,&quot; and notes that even with average incomes &quot;very high by global standards,&quot; US citizens &quot;face greater material hardship than their counterparts in much poorer countries.&quot; These developments, along with financial instability and limited political choice, have resulted in political polarization, instability and revolt in the United States.

A 2022 study published in &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; found that in countries where neoliberal institutions have significant influence over policy the psychology of those populations are molded not only to be more willing to tolerate large levels of income inequality, but actually prefer it over more egalitarian outcomes.

=== Right-wing populism and nationalism ===

Research by Kristen Ghodsee, ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that widespread discontent with neoliberal capitalism has led to a &quot;red nostalgia&quot; in much of the former Communist bloc. She argues that &quot;the political freedoms that came with democracy were packaged with the worst type of unregulated, free-market capitalism, which completely destabilized the rhythms of everyday life and brought crime, corruption and chaos where there had once been comfortable predictability.&quot; This ultimately fueled a resurgence of nationalist politicians and parties, such as Vladimir Putin in Russia, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus, and the Law and Justice party in Poland.

The aftermath of the Great Recession and decline of the Rust Belt have been cited as contributing to the rise of right-wing populism in the United States, including the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

=== Corporatocracy ===


Some organizations and economists argue that neoliberal policies increase the power of corporations and shift wealth to the upper classes. For instance, Jamie Peck and Adam Tickell argue that urban citizens are increasingly deprived of the power to shape the basic conditions of daily life, which are instead shaped by corporations involved in the competitive economy.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, two major international organizations which often espouse neoliberal views, have been criticized for advancing neoliberal policies around the world. Sheldon Richman, editor of the libertarian journal &quot;The Freeman&quot;, argues that the IMF has imposed a &quot;corporatist-flavored &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27; on the troubled countries of the world.&quot; He contends that IMF policies of spending cuts and tax increases, as well as subjection to paternalistic supranational bureaucrats, have fostered &quot;long-term dependency, perpetual indebtedness, moral hazard, and politicization&quot; in the developing world, which has undermined &quot;real market reform&quot; and &quot;set back the cause of genuine liberalism.&quot; Ramaa Vasudevan, associate professor of economics at Colorado State University, states that trade policies and treaties fostered by the United States in the neoliberal era, along with bailouts brokered by the World Bank and the IMF, have allowed corporate capital to expand around the world unimpeded by trade protections or national borders, &quot;sucking countries in different regions of the world into global corporations&#x27; logic of accumulation.&quot; This expansion of global corporate capital, Vasudevan says, has buttressed its ability to &quot;orchestrate a global division of labor most conducive to the demands of profitability&quot; which in turn has facilitated &quot;a brutal, global race to the bottom&quot;.

Mark Arthur, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development Research in Denmark, has written that the influence of neoliberalism has given rise to an &quot;anti-corporatist&quot; movement in opposition to it. This &quot;anti-corporatist&quot; movement is articulated around the need to reclaim the power that corporations and global institutions have stripped from governments. He says that Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;rules for mindful markets&quot; served as a basis for the anti-corporate movement, &quot;following government&#x27;s failure to restrain corporations from hurting or disturbing the happiness of the neighbor [Smith]&quot;.

=== Mass incarceration ===
Several scholars have linked mass incarceration of the poor in the United States with the rise of neoliberalism. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant and Marxist economic geographer David Harvey have argued that the criminalization of poverty and mass incarceration is a neoliberal policy for dealing with social instability among economically marginalized populations. According to Wacquant, this situation follows the implementation of other neoliberal policies, which have allowed for the retrenchment of the social welfare state and the rise of punitive workfare, whilst increasing gentrification of urban areas, privatization of public functions, the shrinking of collective protections for the working class via economic deregulation and the rise of underpaid, precarious wage labor. By contrast, it is extremely lenient in dealing with those in the upper echelons of society, in particular when it comes to economic crimes of the upper class and corporations such as fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, credit and insurance fraud, money laundering and violation of commerce and labor codes. According to Wacquant, neoliberalism does not shrink government, but instead sets up a &quot;centaur state&quot; with little governmental oversight for those at the top and strict control of those at the bottom.

In expanding upon Wacquant&#x27;s thesis, sociologist and political economist John L. Campbell of Dartmouth College suggests that through privatization the prison system exemplifies the centaur state. He states that &quot;on the one hand, it punishes the lower class, which populates the prisons; on the other hand, it profits the upper class, which owns the prisons, and it employs the middle class, which runs them.&quot; In addition, he argues that the prison system benefits corporations through outsourcing, as inmates are &quot;slowly becoming a source of low-wage labor for some US corporations&quot;. Both through privatization and outsourcing, Campbell argues, the penal state reflects neoliberalism. Campbell also argues that while neoliberalism in the United States established a penal state for the poor, it also put into place a debtor state for the middle class and that &quot;both have had perverse effects on their respective targets: increasing rates of incarceration among the lower class and increasing rates of indebtedness—and recently home foreclosure—among the middle class.&quot;

David McNally, Professor of Political Science at York University, argues that while expenditures on social welfare programs have been cut, expenditures on prison construction have increased significantly during the neoliberal era, with California having &quot;the largest prison-building program in the history of the world&quot;. The scholar Bernard Harcourt contends the neoliberal concept that the state is inept when it comes to economic regulation, but efficient in policing and punishing &quot;has facilitated the slide to mass incarceration&quot;. Both Wacquant and Harcourt refer to this phenomenon as &quot;Neoliberal Penality&quot;.

=== Financialization ===
The implementation of neoliberal policies and the acceptance of neoliberal economic theories in the 1970s are seen by some academics as the root of financialization, with the Great Recession as one of its results. In particular, various neoliberal ideologies that had long been advocated by elites, such as monetarism and supply-side economics, were translated into government policy by the Reagan administration, which resulted in decreased government regulation and a shift from a tax-financed state to a debt-financed one. While the profitability of industry and the rate of economic growth never recovered to the heyday of the 1960s, the political and economic power of Wall Street and finance capital vastly increased due to debt-financing by the state. A 2016 International Monetary Fund (IMF) report blames certain neoliberal policies for exacerbating financial crises around the world, causing them to grow bigger and more damaging.

=== Globalization ===
Neoliberalism is commonly viewed by scholars as encouraging of globalization, which is the subject of much criticism.

The emergence of the &quot;precariat&quot;, a new class facing acute socio-economic insecurity and alienation due to offshoring and a global race to the bottom, has been attributed to the globalization of neoliberalism.

In a 2022 article for the journal &quot;Global Environmental Change&quot;, Jason Hickel et al. argued that unequal exchange between the Global North and Global South in the era of neoliberal globalization led to a quantified $242 trillion in net appropriation of raw materials, energy and labor from the latter to the former (constant 2010 USD) between 1990 and 2015.

====Economic nationalism====
Some critics of neoliberalism view it as weakening the sovereignty of nations in favor of cosmopolitanism and globalization. Neoliberalism favors immigration, in contrast to right-wing populist political parties that oppose immigration.

Neoliberalism also favors investor–state dispute settlement in free trade agreements, which has been criticized as violating sovereign immunity and the capacity of governments to implement reforms and legislative programs related to public health, environmental protection, and human rights.

=== Imperialism ===
A number of scholars have alleged neoliberalism encourages or covers for imperialism. For instance, Ruth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Sheffield, accuses the United States and its allies of fomenting state terrorism and mass killings during the Cold War as a means to buttress and promote the expansion of capitalism and neoliberalism in the developing world. As an example of this, Blakeley says the case of Indonesia demonstrates that the U.S. and the UK put the interests of capitalist elites over the human rights of hundreds of thousands of Indonesians by supporting the Indonesian Army as it waged a campaign of mass killings, which resulted in the annihilation of the Communist Party of Indonesia and its civilian supporters. Historian Bradley R. Simpson posits that this campaign of mass killings was &quot;an essential building block of the neoliberal policies that the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia after Sukarno&#x27;s ouster.&quot;
Geographer David Harvey argues neoliberalism encourages an indirect form of imperialism that focuses on the extraction of resources from developing countries via financial mechanisms.

This is practiced through international institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank who negotiate debt relief with developing nations. He alleges that these institutions prioritize the financial institutions that grant the loans over the debtor countries and place requirements on loans that, in effect, act as financial flows from debtor countries to developed countries (for example, to receive a loan a state must have sufficient foreign exchange reserves—requiring the debtor state to buy US Treasury bonds, which have interest rates lower than those on the loan). Economist Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist of the World Bank from 1997 to 2000, has said of this: &quot;What a peculiar world in which poor countries are in effect subsidizing the richest.&quot;

=== Global health ===
The neoliberal approach to global health advocates privatization of the healthcare industry and reduced government interference in the market, and focuses on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank rather than government. This approach has faced considerable criticism, such as the TRIPS Agreement hampering access to essential medicines in the Global South (i.e. during the AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics).

James Pfeiffer, Professor of Global Health at the University of Washington, has criticised the use of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and IMF in Mozambique, which resulted in reduced government health spending, leading international NGOs to fill service holes previously filled by government. Rick Rowden, a Senior Economist at Global Financial Integrity, has criticised the IMF&#x27;s monetarist approach of prioritising price stability and fiscal restraint, which he alleges was unnecessarily restrictive and prevented developing countries from scaling up long-term investment in public health infrastructure.

Within the developed capitalist world, according to Dylan Sullivan and Jason Hickel, neoliberal countries like the United States have inferior health outcomes and more poverty compared to social democracies with universalist welfare states, in particular the Nordics. Some commentators have blamed neoliberalism for various social ills, including mass shootings, increased homelessness, and deaths of despair in the United States, sense of social disconnection, competition, and loneliness.

=== Environmental impact ===

It has been argued that trade-led, unregulated economic activity and lax state regulation of pollution have led to environmental degradation. Furthermore, modes of production encouraged under neoliberalism may reduce the availability of natural resources over the long term, and may therefore not be sustainable within the world&#x27;s limited geographical space.

In Robert Fletcher&#x27;s 2010 piece, &quot;Neoliberal Environmentality: Towards a Poststructuralist Political Ecology of the Conservation Debate&quot; his premise is that there is a conflict of ideas in conservation; that on one side of things you have deep ecology and protectionist paradigms and on the other side you have community based conservation efforts. There are problems with both approaches, and on either side they frequently fail to do conservation work in a substantial way. In the middle, Fletcher sees a space where social sciences are able to critique both sides of and blend the approaches, forming not a triangle of ideologies, but a spectrum. The relationship between capitalism and conservation is one that has to be reckoned with due to an overarching neoliberal framework guiding most conservation efforts.

According to ecologist William E. Rees, the &quot;neoliberal paradigm contributes significantly to planetary unraveling&quot; by treating the economy and the ecosphere as totally separate systems, and by neglecting the latter. Marxist economic geographer David Harvey argues neoliberalism is to blame for increased rates of extinction. Notably, he observes that &quot;the era of neoliberalization also happens to be the era of the fastest mass extinction of species in the Earth&#x27;s recent history.&quot; American philosopher and animal rights activist Steven Best argues that three decades of neoliberal policies have &quot;marketized the entire world&quot; and intensified &quot;the assault on every ecosystem on the earth as a whole&quot;. Neoliberalism reduces the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; to an argument for private ownership.

The Friedman doctrine, which Nicolas Firzli has argued defined the neoliberal era, may lead companies to neglect concerns for the environment. Firzli insists that prudent, fiduciary-driven long-term investors cannot ignore the environmental, social and corporate governance consequences of actions taken by the CEOs of the companies whose shares they hold as &quot;the long-dominant Friedman stance is becoming culturally unacceptable and financially costly in the boardrooms of pension funds and industrial firms in Europe and North America&quot;.

Critics like Noel Castree focus on the relationship between neoliberalism and the biophysical environment explain that critics of neoliberals see the free market as the best way to mediate the relationship between producers and consumers, as well as maximize freedom in a more general sense which they view as inherently good. Castree also asserts that the assumption that markets will allow for the maximization of individual freedom is incorrect.

Conservation and management of natural resources has also been impacted by neoliberal policies and development. Prior to the neoliberalization of conservation efforts, conservation was done on the part of governmental and regulatory entities. Although conservation has typically been considered the &quot;antithesis of production&quot;, with the global shift towards neoliberalization, conservation programs have also shifted towards becoming a &quot;mode of capitalist production&quot;. It&#x27;s done so through the reliance on private entities, non-governmental organizations, resource commodification and entrepreneurship (big and small). Access to the market through natural resource commodification became a neoliberal tool for communities and regions to further develop.

One scholar and critic of neoliberal conservation, Dan Klooster, published a study on forest certification in Mexico which demonstrated the socio-environmental consequences of neoliberal conservation networks. In this example, global markets and a desire for sustainably-sourced products led to the adoption of forest certification programs, such as the Forest Conservation Fund, by Mexican companies. These certifications require that forest managers make improvements to the environmental and social aspects of harvesting wood and in return they gain access to international markets that prefer the consumption of certified wood. Today, 12 percent of Mexico&#x27;s logged forests do so under a certification. However, many small logging businesses aren&#x27;t able to successfully compete amongst the global market forces without accepting inaccessible costs to certification and unsatisfactory market prices and demand. Klooster uses this conservation example to demonstrate how the social impacts of conservation commodification can be both positive and negative. On the one hand the certification can create networks of producers, certifiers and consumers that oppose the socio-environmental disparities caused by the forestry industry, but on the other hand they might also widen further the north–south divisions.

=== Religious opposition ===

Catholic political scientist Albert Bikaj considers the neoliberal concept of free market &quot;fundamentally nihilistic&quot; because it&#x27;s profit-oriented, neglecting Christian ethics and undermining human dignity, common good, environment, and civilisation. In his 84-page apostolic exhortation , Catholic Pope Francis described unfettered capitalism as &quot;a new tyranny&quot; and called on world leaders to fight rising poverty and inequality, stating:
=== Political opposition ===

In political science, disillusionment with neoliberalism is seen as a cause of de-politicization and the growth of anti-political sentiment, which can in turn encourage populist politics and re-politicization.

Instances of political opposition to neoliberalism from the late 1990s onward include:
* Research by Kristen Ghodsee, ethnographer and Professor of Russian and East European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that widespread discontent with neoliberal capitalism has led to a &quot;red nostalgia&quot; in much of the former Communist bloc. She argues that &quot;the political freedoms that came with democracy were packaged with the worst type of unregulated, free-market capitalism, which completely destabilized the rhythms of everyday life and brought crime, corruption and chaos where there had once been comfortable predictability&quot;, which ultimately fueled a resurgence of extremist nationalism.
* In Latin America, the &quot;pink tide&quot; that swept leftist governments into power at the turn of the millennium can be seen as a reaction against neoliberal hegemony and the notion that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; (TINA) to the Washington Consensus.
* In protest against neoliberal globalization, South Korean farmer and former president of the Korean Advanced Farmers Federation Lee Kyung-hae committed suicide by stabbing himself in the heart during a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Cancun, Mexico, in 2003. He was protesting against the decision of the South Korean government to reduce subsidies to farmers.
*The rise of anti-austerity parties in Europe and SYRIZA&#x27;s victory in the Greek legislative elections of January 2015 have some proclaiming &quot;the end of neoliberalism&quot;.
*In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, both Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Bernie Sanders from the Democratic Party ran on platforms opposing neoliberalism, including opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership and offshoring.
*In 2018, the yellow vests protests in France and the 2019–2021 Chilean protests emerged in direct opposition to neoliberal governments and policies, including privatization and austerity, that were blamed for the rising cost of living, surging personal debts, and increased economic inequality. In 2019, protests against neoliberal reforms, policies and governments have taken place in scores of countries on 5 continents, with opposition to austerity, privatization and tax hikes on the working classes being a common theme among many of them. 
* During the 2021 Chilean general election, president-elect Gabriel Boric promised to end the country&#x27;s neoliberal economic model, stating that &quot;if Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it will also be its grave.&quot;

=== Repression of worker&#x27;s union ===
While neoliberalism itself doesn&#x27;t directly imply the repression of worker&#x27;s union, global trading benefits from the repression of trade unions. Margaret Thatcher, a former UK prime minister and known prominent leader of neoliberalism (while Ronald Reagan in the United States promoted a set of neoliberal reforms known as &quot;Reaganomics&quot;), introduced a series of policies to reduce the power and influence of trade unions and various social benefits. According to BBC News, Thatcher reportedly &quot;managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation&quot;.

<text>Beverly Hills, 90210 (often referred to by its short title, 90210) is an American teen drama television series created by Darren Star and produced by Aaron Spelling under his production company Spelling Television. The series ran for ten seasons on Fox from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000, and is the first of six television series in the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; franchise. The series follows the lives of a group of friends living in Beverly Hills, California, as they transition from high school to college and into the adult world. &quot;90210&quot; refers to one of the city&#x27;s five ZIP codes.

The initial premise of the show was based on the adjustment and culture shock that twins Brandon (Jason Priestley) and Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) experienced when they and their parents, Jim (James Eckhouse) and Cindy (Carol Potter), moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Beverly Hills, California. In addition to chronicling the characters&#x27; friendships and romantic relationships, the show addressed topical issues such as sex, date rape, homophobia, animal rights, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, eating disorders, racism (including antisemitism), teenage suicide, teenage pregnancy, and AIDS.

After poor ratings during its first season, the series gained popularity during the summer of 1991, when Fox aired a special &quot;summer season&quot; of the show while most other series were in reruns. Viewership increased dramatically, and &quot;90210&quot; became one of Fox&#x27;s top shows when it returned that fall. The show became a global pop culture phenomenon with its cast members, particularly Jason Priestley and Luke Perry, who became teen idols; the series also made actresses Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth household names in the United States. The show is credited with creating or popularizing the teen soap genre that many other successful television shows followed in the years to come.

The show had many cast changes; Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green, and Ian Ziering were the only actors to appear during its entire run and appeared on the first episode of the spin-off &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. On February 27, 2019, it was announced that a six-episode reboot had been ordered by Fox and that the show would simply be titled &quot;BH90210&quot;. The revival premiered on Fox on August 7, 2019, and was cancelled on November 7, 2019.

==Series overview==

 The series begins with the introduction of the Walsh family—Jim, Cindy, Brandon, and Brenda—who have recently moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Beverly Hills, California, as a result of Jim&#x27;s job promotion. In the first episode, Brandon and Brenda begin attending West Beverly Hills High School, where they befriend several classmates: the self-centered and promiscuous Kelly Taylor, carefree and spoiled Steve Sanders, smart and driven Andrea Zuckerman, ditzy and virtuous Donna Martin, brooding loner Dylan McKay, and younger and naive students David Silver and Scott Scanlon. The show follows the siblings as they bear witness and take part in the dramatic lives that their wealthy and privileged peers lead.

==Characters==

;Cast notes
==Casting==
Torand Productions was used by the production company for several seasons on the show. &quot;Torand&quot; is derived from the first several letters of Aaron Spelling&#x27;s first and second children, Tori and Randy.

The original name for the show, used during shooting of the original pilot in March and April 1990, was &quot;Doing Time in Beverly Hills&quot;; later, the tentative title for the show changed to &quot;Class of Beverly Hills&quot;. The show&#x27;s episodes were issue-based until the producers decided it should become a teen soap opera. In the first season, the teenage characters (aside from David Silver and Scott Scanlon) were said to be in the eleventh grade, but due to the success of the show, their ages were retconned to be one year younger in the second season, making them tenth graders in the first.

Jennie Garth had to audition five times for the role of Kelly Taylor and was the first to be cast on the show. Gabrielle Carteris felt that she was too old to play a high school student. She first auditioned for Brenda because she thought that being a real-life twin would help her chances, but the producers felt that she would be better for the part of Andrea.

When Tori Spelling (Aaron Spelling&#x27;s daughter) auditioned for the show, she used the name Tori Mitchell and auditioned for the role of Kelly Taylor, but she was eventually recognized and was instead cast as Donna Martin. Tori Spelling brought Shannen Doherty to her father&#x27;s attention after seeing Doherty&#x27;s movie &quot;Heathers&quot; and being impressed with her performance.

Lyman Ward was originally cast as Jim Walsh in the pilot but was replaced by James Eckhouse, and Ward&#x27;s scenes were cut and re-shot with Eckhouse. Kristin Dattilo was also up for the role of Brenda Walsh, but she turned it down. She later guest starred as Melissa Coolidge in an episode of the first season.

Additionally, Luke Perry had auditioned for the role of Steve Sanders, but the role eventually went to Ian Ziering before Perry was cast as Dylan McKay. Perry&#x27;s character was not an original cast member of the show, and he was first featured in the show&#x27;s second episode. He was originally intended to only appear in one story arc, for one or two episodes. Fox was initially reluctant to have him included as a regular, but Aaron Spelling felt differently and gave Perry a bigger role during the first two years until the network was won over.

In the first season, when Donna tries out for school D.J., she is referred to as Donna Morgan. Throughout the rest of the show, her name is Donna Martin.

In addition, in the first season Donna&#x27;s mother was named Nancy Martin and played by actress Jordana Capra. When she was reintroduced in season two, she was named Felice Martin and was played by actress Katherine Cannon.

In the pilot episode, the role of Jackie Taylor was played by Pamela Galloway and by Ann Gillespie for the rest of the series. Terence Ford and Arthur Brooks portrayed Dylan&#x27;s father, Jack McKay, in two episodes before Josh Taylor assumed the role.

===Departures===
The departure of Shannen Doherty at the end of season 4 came after a period of strife between Doherty, the other cast members, and the show&#x27;s producers. Executive producer Charles Rosin commented in 2000 that Doherty &quot;had habitual lateness, her lateness was appalling, and she had a callous attitude and an indifference.&quot; Trouble between Doherty and her co-stars, Jennie Garth in particular, was also widely reported in the media. Doherty, who was struggling in her personal life with her father&#x27;s illness, came to an agreement with the producers to phase her out of the show at the beginning of season 4, when Brenda returns to Minnesota for college. It was planned to reduce her appearances from that point, but Doherty had a change of heart and requested to remain as a main cast member. However, as the fourth season wore on Doherty&#x27;s attitude deteriorated and her friction with the other cast members intensified. When she caused continuity problems by cutting her hair halfway through filming an episode, the producers and cast requested from Aaron Spelling that she be fired.

In season 5, the production accommodated Gabrielle Carteris&#x27; pregnancy by reluctantly writing a pregnancy storyline for Andrea. The producers were unhappy with the more adult direction of the character, and Carteris was written off the show at the end of the season. Also in season 5, Jamie Walters was introduced as Donna&#x27;s boyfriend Ray, who later begins abusing her. The writers intended to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; the character in season 6, and Walters signed a $1 million contract. However, the show received such a flood of negative mail from fans complaining about Donna being &quot;stupid&quot; for staying with her abuser, that an angry Aaron Spelling ordered that Walters should be fired. Producer Larry Mollin said of the incident that &quot;he [Walters] got to walk away with his money. But it was still devastating for him. We left him as being a beater, which stayed with him, unfortunately. People thought he was a beater. It was just terrible.&quot;
In Season 9 Jason Priestley left the show after starring in 4 episodes.

==Locations==

The series was produced in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California. During the 10 years the series was in production it was filmed in a warehouse complex in Van Nuys, the interiors of the series as well as the exteriors of the Peach Pit parking lot and P.P.A.D. club entrance were all located off the 15000 block of Calvert Street. An unmarked gated studio entrance now stands at this address, but the exterior brick facing of the P.P.A.D. is still visible down the alley, on the side of the building.

The studio building complex has since been the home to various projects including the 2006 CBS series &quot;Jericho&quot;, which guest starred James Eckhouse in one episode. Until February 2010, the CW series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; was also produced at the original &quot;90210&quot; Calvert studios. Post-production services for &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; were provided by LaserPacific for all seasons.

Many changes were made after the pilot episode. The producers first used a location that was used only once during the pilot episode for the Walsh house, that was located in a gated community of Brentwood. After the pilot episode the Walsh house was moved to Altadena, California. The house used for Dylan&#x27;s home in the show is located in the same Altadena neighborhood.

Three locations were used for the frontage of The Peach Pit during the show&#x27;s ten-year history. The original location, on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, was used in only the first few episodes of season one and was changed to a different location for the rest of that season. When the Peach Pit was fictionally remodeled during season two, the producers used Rose City Diner in Pasadena, California, to film the exterior of the gang&#x27;s hangout, and it remained the same throughout the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

Most of the filming during the second season of the summer season at the Beverly Hills Beach Club took place in Santa Monica, at the old Sand and Sea Beach Club. The beach club used in the show was the very same beach club that was used during one summer season of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;.

The filming location for West Beverly High School was in the middle class community of Torrance at Torrance High School, located in the 90501 zip code. Torrance High can also be seen in other shows such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

When the &quot;90210&quot; characters began attending the then-fictitious California University in the show&#x27;s fourth season, the scenes around campus were actually filmed at Occidental College in Eagle Rock. Kelly and Donna&#x27;s beach house used in the show is located in Hermosa Beach. The Golden Oak Ranch, outside Santa Clarita, was also used for filming.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; originally aired from October 4, 1990, to May 17, 2000, on Fox in the United States. The show aired Thursday at 9:00 pm for the first two seasons and Wednesday at 8:00 pm for the rest of its run.

Prior to the premiere of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot; was airing on Thursdays at 9:00 pm. After the show had moved to Wednesday, where Fox did not have regular programming, &quot;The Heights&quot; took over the timeslot. After &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; left Fox in 2000, it went to air reruns on syndication and was replaced by &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot;.

Seasons 2 and 3 featured all new summer episodes that aired during July and August before the regular fall episodes started in September. At the beginning of the third season, in July and August 1992, all new summer episodes of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; were playing during the series new time slot of Wednesdays at 8pm but viewers could see repeats from &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; first season in the original time slot of Thursdays at 9pm. The Fox Network was heavily promoting the new time slot so viewers could find the show. The seventh season started earlier than usual because of the 1996 Olympics and the MLB Playoffs on Fox during the month of October.

At various times since 1998, reruns of the show have aired in syndication, on FX until 2005. Later SoapNet aired reruns of the show seven days a week until 2013. The syndicated episodes featured the show&#x27;s original music, unlike the DVD and Hulu releases. Since 2014, Pop airs reruns of the show with two back-to-back episodes, sometimes three or four. The syndicated episodes that are featured on this network however, do not use the show&#x27;s original music with the content mostly taken from the DVD releases.

===Specials===

A number of specials were produced during and after the show&#x27;s run.

==Reception==

===U.S. ratings===

After poor ratings in the first season, the episodes&#x27; average ratings per season increased, constantly maintained above 11% from season two until season five, despite Shannen Doherty&#x27;s departure at the end of season four. From season six until the end of the series the average rating gradually decreased, and the final blow to the show was the early ninth season&#x27;s departures of Jason Priestley and Tiffani Thiessen (both season peaks at 8.1%). Since then no episode reached 8% again in ratings until the series finale, despite Luke Perry&#x27;s return, with average ratings falling to 6.9% in season nine and 5.9% in the last season. During the entire series, the episodes with the highest ratings peaked at 14.1%, and included the closing episodes of seasons two and three, and the opening episode of season five.


* Debut: Class of Beverly Hills/Pilot – 7.2 rating
* Series finale: 16.8 million viewers; 9.6 rating (8 pm – 10 pm)
* Specials:
** Behind the Scenes (Season 3): 8.2 rating
** Best Moments of 90210 (Season 6): 8.4 rating
** Our Favorite Moments of 90210 (Season 9): 5.3 rating
** Final Goodbye (Season 10): 6.8 rating
** 10-Year High School Reunion (7 million viewers, 4.5 rating) (repeat on August 7, 2003: 3.3 million; 2.1 rating)

===Series finale===
Ratings for the tenth season declined to an average of 10 million viewers per episode (according to a May 2000 issue of &quot;Us Weekly&quot;). The ratings were low compared to previous seasons. The lower ratings, along with the high costs associated with any television show in its later seasons, led Fox to end the series in January 2000. Though there were many cast changes, over 25 million people tuned in to watch the final episode, which aired in May 2000. Tiffani Thiessen returned in the series finale.

==Impact==
In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the show #20 on its list of top 100 TV shows in the past 25 years. The magazine also named the theme music #15 on its list of top 25 TV themes in the past 25 years, and the &quot;90210 Sideburns&quot; #50 on its list of Pop Culture Moments that Rocked Fashion. The show was named one of the Best School Shows of All Time by AOL TV.

The first-season episode &quot;Spring Dance&quot; caused outrage from many parents after the character of Brenda loses her virginity to Dylan. Parents were offended by the fact that Brenda suffers no consequences and shows no remorse for having had sex, something unusual for network television in 1991. After a slew of angry phone calls to the network, Fox decided to placate upset viewers by featuring a pregnancy scare for Brenda and Dylan in the second season, as a means of &quot;punishing&quot; the teenagers for their decision. Executive Producer Charles Rosin criticized this decision, saying &quot;Someday I will write a long article about the censorship that occurred after Brenda lost her virginity at the Spring Dance to her boyfriend (who had been AIDS tested) because she was happy and not full of remorse.&quot;

In February 1992, at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, the three main stars Jason Priestley, Shannen Doherty and Luke Perry were featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

===Parodies===
The rap duo Insane Clown Posse released an EP titled &quot;Beverly Kills 50187&quot; which featured a song titled &quot;Beverly Kills&quot; describing member Violent J killing the series&#x27; characters for being rich and prejudiced toward the &quot;lower class&quot;.

The short-lived &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; did a parody of this show, &quot;The Heights&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot; called &quot;Melrose Heights 90210-2420&quot; that portrayed the cast as superficial, self-absorbed, and self-pitying, as well as introducing each of the stereotypical cast along with &quot;Akeem, the black guy&quot;. A typical episode&#x27;s &quot;issue&quot; was a character getting a headache, which affected all the other characters. Each episode would end with the same upbeat song (resembling &quot;The Heights&quot; hit single &quot;How Do You Talk to an Angel&quot;) performed by the whole cast with new lyrics for each episode.

When Jason Priestley guest-hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1992, one of that episode&#x27;s sketches, which parodied &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, involved that town&#x27;s zip code being changed to 90218 due to the 1990 Census redistricting. Several of the characters take offense to the fact that Beverly Hills will be absorbed into poorer communities and convene at the Peach Pit, where a Hispanic busboy expresses pride that his native community of Reseda now shares the same zip code as the &quot;90210&quot; cast. The gang lashes out in different ways, with Dylan getting drunk and Donna and Kelly going impulse shopping. Priestley, in his role of Brandon, confiscates all their keys and puts them in a lockbox and gives them a tag to reclaim them when they regain self-control. The sketch ends with the zip code &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; retained as their rich and powerful parents lobbied the US government not to redistrict.

The Fox sketch show &quot;The Edge&quot; did a parody of &quot;90210&quot; that mocked Tori Spelling. During the sketch, the character of Tori constantly says, &quot;I can do whatever I want because this is my Daddy&#x27;s show.&quot; Aaron Spelling took offense to this, and asked for an apology from the producers of the show. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; also did a Tori Spelling parody as well, where Melanie Hutsell spoofed Spelling, which was met with less protest.

&quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; did a parody sketch called &quot;Beverly Hillbillies 90210&quot;, combining the characters of both &quot;90210&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. In 1999, Christina Aguilera from the Mickey Mouse Club made a cameo performance on &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; as herself performing at the PPAD for David Silver&#x27;s surprise birthday party, season 10 episode 2: &quot;Let&#x27;s Eat Cake&quot;. Music from former MMC members Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez of &#x27;N Sync also was originally used during several opening title sequences during the mid-to-late seasons of &quot;90210&quot;.

&quot;MADtv&quot; made its own parodies of the show as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210 B.C.&quot; set in prehistoric Beverly Hills. When Luke Perry made his high-profile return to the series, MADtv did a second parody titled &quot;Beverly Hills 9021-H20&quot; which had the characters being stalked and killed off by Luke Perry (Pat Kilbane), who had rejoined the cast as a masked killer who was a parody of Michael Myers of the &quot;Halloween&quot; film series.

The Czech TV Nova parody show &quot;Tele Tele&quot; made a parody of the show known as &quot;Heverly Debils&quot;. Three mini-episodes (about 10 minutes each) were filmed.

GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan released a song called &quot;Killah Hills 10304&quot;, a reference to the show&#x27;s title in a song about crime and a rough neighborhood.

A VH1 promo for &quot;I Love the 90s&quot; featured Hal Sparks and Michael Ian Black sitting in the Peach Pit, with &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; theme music playing. Joe E. Tata also appears in the promo as Nat.

In 2009, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; aired an episode called &quot;Waverly Hills, 9-0-2-1-D&#x27;oh&quot;, which features Lisa wanting to go to a better school and finding it in the very posh town of Waverly Hills.

===In pop culture===
In 2021, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; was one of the shows featured on season 1, episode 3 of Vice Media&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the 90&#x27;s&quot; entitled &quot;TV for Teens.&quot;

==Home media==

The following is a list of all home video releases for &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;:

===VHS===
===DVD===
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all ten seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2 &amp; 4. Due to music licensing issues, most of the original music has been replaced on these DVD releases. Deleted songs include &quot;Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot;, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. Starting with Season 2, some episodes are edited from their original broadcast versions.

For reasons that were never made clear, the first three-season releases used promotional pictures from their succeeding seasons instead of the actual promotional pictures that were taken while the seasons aired. Due to the group pictures from the fourth season being used on the third season DVD and the absence of Shannen Doherty in later seasons, a collage of still photos was used on the fourth season. Jamie Walters was not featured on the covers of any of the seasons that he regularly appeared in (although he did appear in some of the DVD menu still shots for seasons 5 and 6). Kathleen Robertson was only featured on the cover of the seventh season, even though she had been a regular since season 6, recurring in the entirety of season 5 and made her first appearance towards the end of season 4 (her photo was, however, used in one of the inner cases for the season 6 release).

Hilary Swank, who was cast as a main star in the eighth season, is featured on the cover of the DVD, even though she left halfway through her only season on the show, while Vincent Young, who joined the cast that same year, is not on the cover at all, or on the cover of the ninth season (he is, however, featured on the tenth season cover), but Lindsay Price, Vanessa Marcil and Luke Perry were all featured on the cover, as were Jason Priestley and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen who both departed the series after a few episodes. Daniel Cosgrove was not featured on the Season 9 cover either even though he was a regular also (he is featured on the season 10 cover).

For seasons 1–8, the DVDs were packaged in individual slim plastic cases which were then housed in a large outer cardboard box. Beginning with season 9, the discs were fitted into a singular standard-sized DVD case. Initial copies came with an outer cardboard slipcase.

The ninety-minute pilot episode was released separately on June 15, 2004.

On November 5, 2013, Paramount (CBS Home Entertainment) released &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210 – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1, with extra bonuses not available on the season sets.

On May 18, 2021, Paramount (CBS Home Entertainment) released &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210 – The Ultimate Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1, which includes the 2019 reboot &quot;BH90210&quot; along with the season sets and bonus extras from the previous release.

==Spin-offs and other media==
=== &quot;Melrose Place&quot; ===
The series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; was a spin-off from the show, as actor Grant Show (who played Jake on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;) appeared for a multi-episode run at the end of the series second season as Kelly&#x27;s love interest, and a friend of Dylan&#x27;s. Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green and Ian Ziering made appearances as their &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; characters in the first few episodes of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

=== &quot;Models Inc&quot; ===
&quot;Models Inc.&quot;, a series about the personal and professional struggles of several young models, spin-off from &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. The series was introduced via the characters Hillary Michaels, the mother of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; Amanda Woodward, and model Sarah Owens—both of whom had appeared in a multi-episode run on &quot;MP&quot;. In addition to his role in &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Jake Hanson was the only character to appear in both &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Models Inc&quot;.

=== &quot;90210&quot; ===
A third spin-off premiered on The CW Network on September 2, 2008, focusing on a family from Kansas who move to Beverly Hills when the children&#x27;s grandmother has an alcohol addiction.

In guest appearances, Jennie Garth, Shannen Doherty and Tori Spelling reprised their roles as Kelly Taylor, Brenda Walsh and Donna Martin, respectively. Joe E. Tata also reprised his role as Nat, owner of the Peach Pit, diner turned coffee house, for a couple of episodes at the beginning of the show&#x27;s first season. Ann Gillespie also reprised her role as Jackie Taylor, Kelly&#x27;s mom, in the first 2 seasons. Jackie dies of cancer early in season 2.

The series was canceled by The CW on February 28, 2013, after five seasons.

=== &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (2009) ===

A fifth series was officially picked up by The CW on May 21, 2009. The show is an updated version of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, featuring a group of young adults living in a West Hollywood apartment complex. &quot;Smallville&quot; producers Todd Slavkin and Darren Swimmer wrote the pilot script and became the executive producers on the series. The series was canceled on May 20, 2010.

===Novelizations===
Several books based on the scripts were written by Mel Gilden.

=== &quot;Unauthorized Story&quot; ===

On October 3, 2015, a television movie called &quot;The Unauthorized Beverly Hills, 90210 Story&quot; was aired on the Lifetime network. The film purports to dramatize the behind-the-scenes making of the series.

==Reboot==

In December 2018 it was reported on &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; that a reboot of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; was being shopped around to different networks. The project was initially developed by Tori Spelling and Jennie Garth in conjunction with CBS Television Studios, and was first hinted at by Spelling on her Instagram page the previous March. The bulk of the original cast is attached, including Garth, Spelling, Shannen Doherty, Jason Priestley, Ian Ziering, Brian Austin Green and Gabrielle Carteris. CBS confirmed on December 18 that the project was in &quot;early development&quot;, adding &quot;We aren&#x27;t confirming much detail except that it is an untraditional take on a reboot with some of the original cast&quot;.

On February 1, 2019, Spelling confirmed that a reboot of the show was underway, stating,

She added that &quot;almost everybody&quot; from the original cast was set to return, with Luke Perry&#x27;s participation initially presumed to be limited because of his work on &quot;Riverdale&quot; until his death on March 4.

Following Perry&#x27;s death, CBS Television executive David Stapf said the new series would honor him in some way. Stapf also confirmed Spelling pitched the idea of a new TV show reuniting the original cast.

On February 27, 2019, it was announced that a six-episode reboot had been ordered by Fox. According to a press release on April 26, 2019, the revival — retitled as BH90210 — would feature the cast playing &quot;heightened versions of themselves&quot; in an irreverent drama &quot;inspired by their real lives and relationships with each other.&quot; On May 8, 2019, it was announced that the reboot would premiere on August 7, 2019, at 9/8c on Fox. It was announced on November 7, 2019, that there would not be a season 2 of the reboot.

<doc id="93093" wikidata="Q4803030" url="?curid=93093" title="As Time Goes By (TV series)">
<text>As Time Goes By is a British romantic sitcom that aired on BBC One from 12 January 1992 to 30 December 2005, running for nine series and two specials. Starring Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer, it follows the relationship between two former lovers who meet unexpectedly after losing contact for 38 years.

The series originated as an idea by Colin Bostock-Smith. It was produced and directed by Sydney Lotterby and was written by Bob Larbey, who had co-written both &quot;The Good Life&quot; and &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; with John Esmonde. In 2004, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was ranked No. 29 in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. The programme&#x27;s original working title had been Winter with Flowers but was changed during its first day of filming because of the cast&#x27;s protests. The new title was taken from the 1931 Herman Hupfeld song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, and the recorded version by Joe Fagin was used as the title music.

The series was produced by Theatre of Comedy Entertainment in association with DLT Entertainment Ltd. for the BBC.

Dench&#x27;s real-life daughter Finty Williams appeared in the title sequence as the young Jean in one of the two pictures. The other was Palmer&#x27;s son, Charles Palmer, as the young Lionel.

==Cast==
===Main===
*Jean Mary Pargetter (later Hardcastle) (Judi Dench) – a former nurse who now owns and runs a secretarial agency in London, &quot;Type for You&quot;. Jean was married to David Hanson, who died young, leaving Jean a widowed single mother.
*Lionel Hardcastle (Geoffrey Palmer) – a retired coffee planter who spent most of his adult life in Kenya. Having sold his coffee plantation and divorced his wife, Lionel has returned to the UK to write his memoirs, entitled “My Life In Kenya”.
*Judith Hanson (Moira Brooker) – daughter of Jean and her late husband David. A two-time divorcee, Judy has moved back into her mother’s house while working at her mother’s secretarial agency.
*Alistair Deacon (Philip Bretherton) – the smooth-talking, wealthy and well-connected publisher who is overseeing the release of Lionel’s memoirs.
*Sandy (Jenny Funnell) – Jean&#x27;s personal secretary and receptionist at Type for You as well as Judy’s best friend.

===Recurring===
*Penny (Moyra Fraser) – Jean&#x27;s condescending, self-absorbed sister-in-law from her first marriage.
*Stephen (Paul Chapman) – Penny&#x27;s entertainingly dull husband, who works as a dentist.
*Richard &quot;Rocky&quot; Hardcastle (Frank Middlemass) – Lionel&#x27;s irrepressible upper-class father who owns a country home in the Hampshire countryside. Vivacious and young at heart, Rocky is the opposite of his son.
*Madge Darbley (Joan Sims) – Rocky’s equally high-spirited fiancée, who is seven years his junior. As Sims passed away in 2001, she does not appear past series 7.
*Harry (David Michaels and Daniel Ryan) – a rugby-obsessed policeman who starts dating Sandy.
*Mrs Bale (Janet Henfrey) – Rocky’s eccentric, very precise housekeeper who is interested in the shipping forecast and Australian Rules Football.
*Lol Ferris (Tim Wylton) – Rocky’s amiable, decidedly rural gardener. Lol has six brothers, all of whom become interested in Sandy.

A continuing plot arc in series 3 and 4 has Lionel writing &quot;Just Two People&quot;, a mini-series for American television. Recurring characters introduced during this time include American producer Mike Barbosa (played by Richard Holmes, who was credited under the pseudonym Otto Jarman) and the secretaries Daisy (played by Justine Glenton and Zoe Hilson) and Mrs Gwen Flack (Vivienne Martin).

In the March 2011 PBS pledge drive programming special &quot;Behind the Britcoms: from Script to Screen&quot; hosted by cast members Moira Brooker and Philip Bretherton, the series creator/producer revealed that Jean Simmons had declined the first offer of the role of Jean (which was written with her in mind) due to her reluctance to uproot her life, specifically mentioning her dogs, garden, and family, in California.

==Plot==
Second Lieutenant Lionel Hardcastle and Middlesex Hospital nurse Jean Pargetter met in the summer of 1953 and fell head over heels in love, but then Lionel was posted to Korea. When he wrote to give her his mailing address there, the letter went astray. Jean assumed he had lost interest in her and stubbornly refused to ask the army to locate him; he, in turn, decided she must have lost interest in him.

After his war service, Lionel emigrated to Kenya, became a coffee planter, and married Margaret, whom he later divorced due to &quot;mutual boredom&quot;. Some time after his divorce he returned to England. Meanwhile, Jean had also married and borne one child, Judith. After her husband&#x27;s death, Jean opened &quot;Type for You&quot;, a secretarial agency. Judith, 35 years old during the series, is twice divorced (from Ken, who had &quot;sad eyes&quot;, and Edward, who was &quot;very clever&quot;); during most of the series, she lives with her mother and works at the secretarial agency.

Lionel, now writing his memoir, &quot;My Life in Kenya&quot;, hires a typist through &quot;Type for You&quot;, unaware that Jean owns the agency. He and Jean first meet again when Lionel picks up Judith for a dinner date. Although Lionel and Jean&#x27;s reunion is full of missteps and miscues, their romance gradually rekindles. In the third series, Lionel moves into Jean&#x27;s house in Holland Park, London; they marry during the fourth series.

Lionel&#x27;s memoir is published by Alistair Deacon, a go-getting entrepreneur much younger than Lionel. When pressed by Lionel, Alistair eventually admits that he only agreed to publish the book as a favour to Lionel&#x27;s father, whose loan to Alistair&#x27;s father was the foundation of Alistair&#x27;s wealth; but he works hard for the success of the book and over time he becomes good friends with Lionel and Jean. Alistair is a vain ladies&#x27; man and likes to call Lionel &quot;Li&quot;, but he is also good-hearted and energetic, and proves resourceful enough to handle many situations that arise.

In the first series, Judith develops a crush on Lionel while Alistair takes a similar interest in Jean and likes to call her &quot;lovely lady&quot;. Both crushes are brief; eventually, Judith and Alistair fall for each other and, in the final series, marry. Other story arcs feature Lionel being asked to write an American TV mini-series, &quot;Just Two People&quot;, based on his early romance with Jean. The mini-series fails after much rewriting and network interference. Jean eventually retires from &quot;Type for You&quot; and later volunteers at a charity shop.

Jean&#x27;s very efficient secretary and Judith&#x27;s best friend is Sandy, who eventually moves in with the Hardcastles after splitting with her boyfriend Nick. After Jean&#x27;s retirement, Judy and Sandy become co-managers of &quot;Type for You&quot;. Sandy dates Harry, a policeman and amateur rugby player, whom she marries at the end of the series. Sandy&#x27;s last name is never revealed on the show.

Other notable characters include Lionel&#x27;s irrepressible father Rocky, whose favourite saying is &quot;Rock on!&quot; and who owns a large country house in Hampshire, which he later gives to Lionel; Rocky&#x27;s housekeeper, Mrs. Bale, who has an unusual interest in the Shipping Forecast and gives exact times that meals will be ready; Rocky&#x27;s gardener, Lol Ferris, who says Jean is a &quot;tender woman&quot;; and Lionel&#x27;s glamorous young secretary Daisy, who firmly repels Alistair&#x27;s clumsy efforts to chat her up every time they meet. In series 3 of the show, Lionel is told by Rocky&#x27;s physician that his father has less than a year to live, but this plotline was dropped and Rocky continued to appear throughout the show&#x27;s later series, including the final &quot;Christmas Specials&quot; in 2005.

Rocky marries Madge, who is as much a character as Rocky is, when he is 85 and she is 78 (Rocky features in the 2005 Christmas Special, where he must be around 97 years old). They travel the world, are country and western music fans, tool about in Madge&#x27;s classic Cadillac convertible (with steer horns on the grille), and hang out at the local pub, where Madge sings. In series nine, Madge is mentioned as being on an archaeological dig in Egypt; in reality, Joan Sims died before filming began. Also appearing many times are Penny, the meddling, neurotic sister of Jean&#x27;s late first husband, who calls Jean &quot;poor Jean&quot;, and Penny&#x27;s well-meaning but dull dentist husband, Stephen, who once accidentally declined an OBE.

==Episodes==
The programme ran for ten series, from 12 January 1992 to 30 December 2005. All of the episodes were thirty minutes long with the exception of the final three episodes which were considerably longer. In December 2020, UKTV split the final two episodes, which were also Christmas specials, into four shorter episodes. They added a &#x27;next time on&#x27; and &#x27;last time on&#x27; segment at the start and end of each episode.

==International broadcasts==
&quot;As Time Goes By&quot; has appeared in the United States on BBC America, and has been running weekly on PBS member stations almost continuously since the early 2000s, with various cast members appearing on its perennial pledge drives. It has run in Canada on BBC Canada and TVOntario, in Australia on ABC, 7TWO, 9Gem and Fox Classics, in New Zealand on both UKTV and SKY Network Television, in Finland on YLE TV1, and on DSTV in Nigeria.

The first episode included a flashback to Jean and Lionel 38 years before.

Only the first series was released on BBC audio cassette. Series One was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra from December 2014 to January 2015.

<doc id="93096" wikidata="Q2915810" url="?curid=93096" title="Company (musical)">
<text>Company is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by George Furth. The original 1970 production was nominated for a record-setting 14 Tony Awards, winning six. &quot;Company&quot; was among the first book musicals to deal with contemporary dating, marriage, and divorce, and is a notable example of a concept musical lacking a linear plot. In a series of vignettes, &quot;Company&quot; follows bachelor Bobby interacting with his married friends, who throw a party for his 35th birthday.

==Background==
George Furth wrote 11 one-act plays planned for Kim Stanley. Anthony Perkins was interested in directing and gave the material to Sondheim, who asked Harold Prince for his opinion. Prince said the plays could be a good basis for a musical about New York marriages with a central character to examine those marriages.

==Synopsis==
In the early 1990s, Furth and Sondheim revised the libretto, cutting and altering dialogue that had become dated and rewriting the end of act one. This synopsis is based on the revised libretto.

===Act I===
Robert is a well-liked single man living in New York City whose friends are married or engaged couples. The couples are Joanne and Larry, Peter and Susan, Harry and Sarah, David and Jenny, and Paul and Amy. It is Robert&#x27;s 35th birthday and the couples have gathered to throw him a surprise party. When Robert fails to blow out any candles on his birthday cake, the couples promise him that his birthday wish will still come true, although Robert wished for nothing, and said that his friends are all he needs (&quot;Company&quot;).

What follows is a series of disconnected vignettes in no chronological order, each featuring Robert visiting with one of the couples or alone on a date with a girlfriend.

In the first vignette, Robert visits Sarah, a foodie who is dieting, and her husband, Harry, a recovering alcoholic. Sarah and Harry taunt each other on their vices, escalating toward karate-like fighting and thrashing that may or may not be playful. This prompts the caustic Joanne, the oldest, most cynical, and most-often divorced of Robert&#x27;s friends, to sarcastically comment to the audience that it is the little things that make a marriage work (&quot;The Little Things You Do Together&quot;). Harry explains, and the men concur, that most people are both thankful and regretful about getting married, and that marriage changes both everything and nothing about the way they live (&quot;Sorry – Grateful&quot;).

Robert is next with Peter and Susan, on their apartment terrace. Peter is an Ivy League graduate, and Susan is a Southern belle; the two seem to be a perfect couple, yet they surprise Robert with the news of their upcoming divorce. At the home of the uptight Jenny and chic David, Robert has brought along some marijuana that the three share. The couple turns to grilling Robert on why he has not yet gotten married. Robert claims he is not against the notion, but three women he is currently dating—Kathy, Marta, and April—appear and proceed, Andrews Sisters-style, to chastise Robert for his reluctance to being committed (&quot;You Could Drive a Person Crazy&quot;). After Jenny asks for another joint, but is discouraged by David, David privately tells Robert that Jenny does not actually like marijuana, but partakes in it as a show of her love for him.

All of Robert&#x27;s male friends are deeply envious about his commitment-free status, and each has found someone they find perfect for Robert (&quot;Have I Got a Girl for You&quot;), but Robert is waiting for someone who merges the best features of all his married female friends (&quot;Someone Is Waiting&quot;). Robert meets his three girlfriends in a small park on separate occasions, as Marta sings of the city: crowded, dirty, uncaring, yet somehow wonderful (&quot;Another Hundred People&quot;). Robert first gets to know April, a slow-witted airline flight attendant. Robert then spends time with Kathy. They had dated previously and both admit that they had each secretly considered marrying the other. They laugh at this coincidence before Robert suddenly considers the idea seriously. However, Kathy reveals that she is leaving for Cape Cod with a new fiancé. Finally, Robert meets with Marta; she loves New York, and babbles on about topics both highbrow and lowbrow. Robert is left stunned.

The scene turns to the day of Amy and Paul&#x27;s wedding; they have lived together for years, but are just now getting married. Amy has gotten an overwhelming case of cold feet, and as the upbeat Paul harmonizes rapturously, a panicking Amy confesses to the audience that she can&#x27;t go through with it (&quot;Getting Married Today&quot;). Robert, the best man, and Paul watch as Amy complains and self-destructs over every petty thing she can possibly think of, and then finally explicitly calls off the wedding. Paul dejectedly storms out into the rain and Robert tries to comfort Amy, but emotionally winds up offering an impromptu proposal to her himself. His words jolt Amy back into reality, and she runs out after Paul, at last ready to marry him. The setting returns to the scene of the birthday party, where Robert is given his cake and tries to blow out the candles again. He wishes for something this time (&quot;Marry Me A Little&quot;).

===Act II===
The birthday party scene is reset, and Robert goes to blow out his candles. This time, he gets them about half out, and the couples have to help him with the rest. The couples share their views on Robert – both complimentary and unflattering – with each other as Robert reflects on being the third wheel (&quot;Side By Side By Side&quot;), soon followed by the up-tempo paean to Robert&#x27;s role as the perfect friend (&quot;What Would We Do Without You?&quot;). In a dance break in the middle of the number, each man, in turn, does a dance step that is answered by his wife. Robert likewise does a step but he has no partner to answer it.

Robert brings April to his apartment for a nightcap, after a date. She marvels at how homey his place is, and he casually leads her to the bed, sitting next to her on it and working on getting her into it. She earnestly tells him of an experience from her past, involving the death of a butterfly; he counters with a bizarre remembrance of his own, obviously fabricated and designed to put her in the mood to succumb to his seduction. Meanwhile, the married women worry about Robert&#x27;s single status and the unsuitable qualities they find in the women he dates (&quot;Poor Baby&quot;). As Robert and April have sex, we hear Robert and April&#x27;s thoughts, interspersed with music that expresses and mirrors their increasing excitement (&quot;Tick-Tock&quot;). In some productions, including the original Broadway production, this is accompanied by a solo dance by Kathy. The next morning, April rises early, to report for duty aboard a flight to Barcelona. Robert tries to get her to stay, at first wholeheartedly, parrying her apologetic protestations that she cannot with playful begging and insistence. As April continues to reluctantly resist his entreaties, and sleepiness retakes him, Bobby loses conviction, agreeing that she &quot;should&quot; go; that change apparently gets to her, and she joyfully declares that she will stay, after all. This takes Robert by surprise, and his astonished, plaintive &quot;Oh, God!&quot; is suffused with fear and regret (&quot;Barcelona&quot;).

Robert and Marta visit Peter and Susan, and learn that Peter flew to Mexico to get the divorce, but he phoned Susan and she joined him there for a vacation. Though they are divorced, they are still living together, claiming they have too many responsibilities to actually leave each other&#x27;s lives, and that their relationship has actually been strengthened. Susan takes Marta inside to make lunch, and Peter asks Robert if he has ever had a homosexual experience. They both admit they have, and Peter hints at the possibility that Robert and he could have such an encounter, but Robert uncomfortably laughs off the conversation as a joke.

Joanne and Larry take Robert out to a nightclub, where Larry dances, and Joanne and Robert sit watching, getting thoroughly drunk. She blames Robert for always being an outsider, only watching life rather than living it, and also persists in berating Larry. She raises her glass in a mocking toast, passing judgment on various types of rich, middle-aged women wasting their lives away with mostly meaningless activities (&quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot;). Her harshest criticism is reserved for those, like herself, who &quot;just watch&quot;, and she concludes with the observation that all these ladies are bound together by a terror that comes with the knowledge that &quot;everybody dies&quot;. Larry returns from the dance floor, taking Joanne&#x27;s drunken rant without complaint and explains to Robert that he still loves her dearly. When Larry leaves to pay the check, Joanne bluntly invites Robert to begin an affair with her, assuring him that she will &quot;take care of him&quot;. Robert&#x27;s reply, &quot;But who will I take care of?&quot; seems to surprise even him, and strikes Joanne as a profound breakthrough on his part. Robert insists he has been open to marriages and commitment, but questions &quot;What do you get?&quot; Upon Larry&#x27;s return, Robert asks again, angrily, &quot;What do you get?&quot; Joanne declares, with some satisfaction, &quot;I just did someone a big favor&quot;. She and Larry go home, leaving Robert lost in frustrated contemplation.

The couples&#x27; recurrent musical motif begins yet again, as they all again invite Robert to &quot;drop by anytime...&quot;. Rather than the cheery, indulgent tone he had responded with in earlier scenes, Robert suddenly, desperately, shouts &quot;STOP!&quot; He sings, openly enumerating the many traps and dangers he perceives in marriage; speaking their disagreements, his friends counter his ideas, one by one, encouraging him to dare to try for love and commitment. Finally, Robert&#x27;s words change, expressing a desire, increasing in urgency, for loving intimacy, even with all its problems, and the wish to meet someone with whom to face the challenge of living (&quot;Being Alive&quot;). The opening party resets a final time; Robert&#x27;s friends have waited two hours, with still no sign of him. At last, they all prepare to leave, expressing a new hopefulness about their absent friend&#x27;s chances for loving fulfillment, and wishing him a happy birthday, wherever he may be, as they leave. Robert then appears alone, smiles, and blows out his candles (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Productions==
===Original Broadway production===
&quot;Company&quot; opened in Boston in out-of-town tryouts, receiving mixed reviews.

Directed by Hal Prince, the musical opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on April 26, 1970, and closed on January 1, 1972, after 705 performances and 12 previews. The opening cast included Dean Jones, who replaced Anthony Perkins early in the rehearsals, Donna McKechnie, Susan Browning, George Coe, Pamela Myers, Barbara Barrie, Charles Kimbrough, Merle Louise, Beth Howland, and Elaine Stritch. Musical staging was by Michael Bennett, assisted by Bob Avian. The set design by Boris Aronson consisted of two working elevators and various vertical platforms that emphasized the musical&#x27;s theme of isolation.

Displeased with the show and struggling with personal issues, Jones left the show on May 28, 1970, and was replaced by understudy Larry Kert, who had created the role of Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

In his September 2, 2015, obituary for Jones in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mike Flaherty reported that &quot;he quit the production, citing stress and depression related to the recent collapse of his own marriage.&quot; Flaherty quotes Jones&#x27; 1982 autobiography, &quot;Under running laughter&quot;, in which he wrote of &quot;Company&quot;: &quot;It was a clever, bright show on the surface, but its underlying message declared that marriage was, at best, a vapid compromise, insoluble and finally destructive.&quot;

Kert earned rave reviews for his performance, and the Tony Awards committee decided that he was eligible to compete for Best Actor in a Musical, an honor usually reserved for the actor who originates a role.

Original replacement cast members included John Cunningham, the original Peter, as Bobby, and Vivian Blaine and Jane Russell, as Joanne.

==== &quot;Original Cast Album: Company&quot; ====

Award-winning documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker captured the making-of the original cast recording shortly after the show opened on Broadway. His 1970 film &quot;Original Cast Album: Company&quot; earned early accolades, as well as a cult following, for its unvarnished look at a grueling recording session. Stritch, Sondheim, and producer Thomas Z. Shepard are featured prominently.

====First national tour====
The first national tour opened on May 20, 1971, at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California, with George Chakiris as Bobby, and closed on May 20, 1972, at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.

===Original London production===
The first West End production opened on January 18, 1972, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, where it closed on November 4, 1972, after 344 performances. The original cast, directed by Harold Prince with choreography by Michael Bennett, featured Larry Kert, Elaine Stritch, Joy Franz (Susan), Beth Howland (Amy) and Donna McKechnie (Kathy). Dilys Watling (Amy) and Julia McKenzie (April) were replacements, later in the run.

With so many Broadway cast members reprising their roles, producers chose not to record a new cast album; instead, they re-released the original cast album, replacing Jones&#x27;s vocals with Kert&#x27;s, and branded it the London cast album.

=== Original Australian production ===
The Sydney Theatre Company presented the first Australian production at the Sydney Opera House&#x27;s Drama Theatre in January and February 1986. Directed by Richard Wherrett, it featured John O&#x27;May as Bobby, Geraldine Turner as Joanne, with other cast members, including Tony Sheldon, Simon Burke, Terence Donovan, and Barry Quin.

=== 1993 reunion concerts ===
Most members of the original Broadway cast reunited in California for a concert to benefit Actors Fund of America AIDS charities and the Long Beach Civic Light Opera. Angela Lansbury served as host for the January 23, 1993, performance at the Terrace Theater, with narration by George Hearn. The reunion concert was repeated for two New York performances in April 1993, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, directed by Barry Brown, with Patti LuPone as host. The excitement of the reunion concerts resonated, even in comparison to later full-scale revivals.

===1995 Broadway revival===
After 43 previews, a revival for the Roundabout Theatre, directed by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Rob Marshall, opened October 5, 1995, at the Criterion Center Stage Right, where it ran for 68 performances. The cast included Boyd Gaines (Bobby), Kate Burton, Robert Westenberg (Harry), Diana Canova, Debra Monk (Joanne), LaChanze, Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise, Jane Krakowski, Danny Burstein (Paul), and Veanne Cox (Amy). This production was nominated for the Tony Award, Best Revival of a Musical.

===1995 London revival===
A London revival directed by Sam Mendes at the Donmar Warehouse opened December 13, 1995, and closed there March 2, 1996; the production quickly transferred to the Albery Theatre, with previews starting March 7, opening March 13, and closing June 29. The cast included Adrian Lester, as the first Black actor to play Bobby in a major production of the show.

A videotaped recording of the Donmar Warehouse production was broadcast by BBC Two on March 1, 1997. On Sunday, November 7, 2010, a one-off concert of &quot;Company&quot;, starring most of the 1995 London revival cast, including Adrian Lester as Bobby, was held at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue.

===Kennedy Center production===
A production for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., presented as part of a summer-long celebration of Sondheim musicals, opened May 17, 2002, for a limited run of 17 performances. Directed by Sean Mathias, the cast included John Barrowman as Robert, Emily Skinner, Walter Charles, Alice Ripley, and Lynn Redgrave. The production used the book from the original Broadway production, instead of the 1995 revision.

===2006 Broadway revival===
A new revival had try-outs at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, Robert S. Marx Theatre in March through April 2006. The cast featured Raúl Esparza (Bobby) and Barbara Walsh (Joanne), with direction and choreography by John Doyle.

This production opened on Broadway on November 29, 2006, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. The actors themselves provided the orchestral accompaniment. For example, Esparza plays percussion, Walsh plays Orchestra Bells and percussion, and Heather Laws (Amy) plays French horn, trumpet and flute. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. The musical closed on July 1, 2007, after 34 previews and 246 performances. The production was filmed for &quot;Great Performances&quot; and broadcast in 2008, with a subsequent DVD release.

===2007 Australian production===
Kookaburra Musical Theatre mounted a production directed by Gale Edwards in Sydney in June 2007, starring David Campbell as Bobby, with a cast including Simon Burke, Anne Looby, James Millar, Pippa Grandison, Katrina Retallick, Tamsin Carroll and Christie Whelan. The show was well-received, and Sondheim travelled to Australia for the first time in thirty years to attend the opening night. However, the production caused major controversy when Whelan was out sick for one performance and (with no understudy) Kookaburra chief executive Peter Cousens insisted the show be performed anyway, but without the character of April. This involved cutting several numbers and scenes with no explanation, and that night&#x27;s performance ended twenty minutes early. Following complaints from the audience, there was considerable negative press attention to the decision, and Sondheim threatened to revoke the production rights for the show.

===2011 New York Philharmonic concert===

In April 2011, Lonny Price directed a staged concert production, with Neil Patrick Harris as Robert, Stephen Colbert as Harry, Craig Bierko as Peter, Jon Cryer as David, Katie Finneran as Amy, Christina Hendricks as April, Aaron Lazar as Paul, Jill Paice as Susan, Martha Plimpton as Sarah, Anika Noni Rose as Marta, Jennifer Laura Thompson as Jenny, Jim Walton as Larry, Chryssie Whitehead as Kathy, and Patti LuPone as Joanne. Paul Gemignani conducted a 35-piece orchestra, which used similar orchestrations to the first Broadway production. This concert followed a long tradition of Stephen Sondheim concert productions at the New York Philharmonic, including &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and &quot;Passion&quot;. The cast reunited on June 12, 2011, to perform &quot;Side by Side by Side&quot; on the 65th Tony Awards, hosted by Harris.

A filmed presentation of the three-night concert production saw limited theatrical release on June 15, 2011, with DVD and Blu-ray releases on November 13, 2012.

=== 2018 West End gender-bent production ===
A West End revival was staged at the Gielgud Theatre which started previews from September 26, 2018, and opened officially, on October 17. The production was part of Elliott &amp; Harper Productions&#x27; debut season, a production company formed by director Marianne Elliott and producer Chris Harper. The revival/remake featured changes to the genders of several characters. The character of Bobby was changed to Bobbie, a female role, and was played by Rosalie Craig. Additionally, the production featured a same-sex couple for the first time, with Jonathan Bailey as cold-footed groom Jamie (originally written as the female character Amy) and Alex Gaumond as his devoted fiancé Paul. Sondheim approved the changes and worked on revisions of the script with director Elliott. Patti LuPone, Ben Lewis and Mel Giedroyc also starred.

&quot;Company&quot; topped the list of the 2019 Olivier Award nominations, alongside &quot;Come from Away&quot;, with nine nominations, winning Best Musical Revival. It also won Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical (LuPone), Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical (Bailey).

The cast recording was made available for digital release and streaming by Warner Classics on February 1, 2019. The production closed on March 30, 2019.

=== 2021 Broadway gender-bent revival ===

A Broadway transfer of the 2018 West End revival opened December 9, 2021, to broad acclaim. Marianne Elliott once again directed, and Patti LuPone reprised her role as Joanne, with Katrina Lenk as Bobbie, choreography by Liam Steel, music supervision and direction by Joel Fram, scenic and costume designs by Bunny Christie, and lighting design by Neil Austin.

Originally slated to open on Sondheim&#x27;s 90th birthday (March 22, 2020), the production began previews at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on March 2. After nine preview performances, the production came to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. All Broadway shows went dark, and theatre closures were subsequently extended numerous times. The production resumed previews November 15, 2021, with Sondheim in attendance shortly before his death. The cast, musicians, and crew then dedicated their entire run to the late composer.

Five days before he died, Sondheim discussed the revival&#x27;s change of the lead character&#x27;s gender from male (Bobby) to female (Bobbie). He expressed how theater is distinguished from film and video because &quot;you can do it in different ways from generation to generation… What keeps theater alive is the chance always to do it differently, with not only fresh casts, but fresh viewpoints. It&#x27;s not just a matter of changing pronouns, but attitudes.&quot;

The production became the most nominated revival of the season, winning five of nine Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Matt Doyle&#x27;s performance as Jamie. The documentary film &quot;Keeping Company with Sondheim&quot; aired on &quot;Great Performances&quot; in May 2022, examining this production alongside the show&#x27;s previous incarnations. The production closed July 31, 2022, after 265 performances and 32 previews.

==== Second national tour ====
The second North American tour opened on October 8, 2023, at the Proctor&#x27;s Theatre in Schenectady, New York and closed on October 6, 2024, at the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. The tour was led by Britney Coleman, who understudied Bobbie in the 2021 Broadway revival.

==Recordings==

The original Broadway cast album features Jones, having been recorded prior to Kert assuming the role of Bobby. When the cast traveled to London to reprise their roles, Columbia Records took Kert into the studio to record new vocal tracks, then mixed out Jones&#x27; original vocals. This recording featuring the new Kert vocals laid over the Broadway backing tracks was released as the Original London Cast recording. After Sony Music acquired the Columbia catalogues, a newly remastered CD of the original Broadway cast recording was released in 1998, featuring Kert&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Being Alive&quot; as a bonus track. The original Broadway cast album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.

Selections from the show were broadcast in 1979 on &quot;Musical Comedy Tonight&quot; hosted by Sylvia Fine, with songs performed by Carol Burnett, Richard Chamberlain, Sandy Duncan, and Bernadette Peters.

Revival cast recordings for both the 1995 Broadway and London productions were released; audio recordings also followed the 2006 actor-orchestra Broadway cast, the 2018 gender-swapped London cast, and the 2021 Spanish cast.

Video recordings were released for the 1995 London, 2006 Broadway, and 2011 New York Philharmonic revivals.

*Due to a performer only being allowed to win the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance once in their lifetime, LuPone wasn&#x27;t able to be officially nominated again; she was however given an honourable mention for her work in &quot;Company&quot;.

== Unproduced film ==
Sondheim approached William Goldman to write a screenplay adaptation of the musical; the director Herbert Ross reportedly talked Sondheim out of doing the film. Speculation arose in 2010 about Neil LaBute working on a film version of the show.

<text>A carronade is a short, smoothbore, cast-iron cannon which was used by the Royal Navy. It was first produced by the Carron Company, an ironworks in Falkirk, Scotland, and was used from the last quarter of the 18th century to the mid-19th century. Its main function was to serve as a powerful, short-range, anti-ship and anti-crew weapon. The technology behind the carronade was greater dimensional precision, with the shot fitting more closely in the barrel, thus transmitting more of the propellant charge&#x27;s energy to the projectile, allowing a lighter gun using less gunpowder to be effective.

Carronades were initially found to be very successful, but they eventually disappeared as naval artillery advanced, with the introduction of rifling and consequent change in the shape of the projectile, exploding shells replacing solid shot, and naval engagements being fought at longer ranges.

== History ==

The carronade was designed as a short-range naval weapon with a low muzzle velocity for merchant ships, but it also found a niche role on warships. It was produced by the Carron ironworks and was at first sold as a system with the gun, mounting, and shot all together. The standard package of shot per gun was 25 roundshot, 15 barshot, 15 double-headed shot, 10 &quot;single&quot; grapeshot, and 10 &quot;single&quot; canister shot. &quot;Single&quot; meant that the shot weighed the same as the roundshot, while some other canister and grapeshot were also included which weighed one and a half times the roundshot.

Its invention is variously ascribed to Lieutenant General Robert Melville in 1759, or to Charles Gascoigne, who was manager of the Carron Company from 1769 to 1779. In its early years, the weapon was sometimes called a &quot;mellvinade&quot; or a &quot;gasconade&quot;. The carronade can be seen as the culmination of a development of naval guns reducing the barrel length and gunpowder charge. The Carron Company was already selling a &quot;new light-constructed&quot; gun, two-thirds of the weight of the standard naval gun and charged with one sixth of the weight of ball in powder before it introduced the carronade, which further halved the gunpowder charge.

===Theory of design===

The advantages for merchant ships are described in an advertising pamphlet of 1779. Production of both shot and gun by the same firm immediately allowed a reduction in the windage, the gap between the bore of the gun and the diameter of the ball. The smaller gunpowder charge reduced the barrel heating in action, and reduced the recoil. The mounting, attached to the side of the ship on a pivot, took the recoil on a slider, without altering the alignment of the gun. The pamphlet advocated the use of woollen cartridges, which eliminated the need for wadding and worming, although they were more expensive.

Simplifying gunnery for comparatively untrained merchant seamen in both aiming and reloading was part of the rationale for the gun. The replacement of trunnions by a bolt underneath, to connect the gun to the mounting, reduced the width of the carriage enhancing the wide angle of fire. A merchant ship would almost always be running away from an enemy, so a wide angle of fire was much more important than on a warship. A carronade weighed a quarter as much and used a quarter to a third of the gunpowder charge as a long gun firing the same cannonball.

The reduced charge allowed carronades to have a shorter length and much lighter weight than long guns. Increasing the size of the bore and ball reduces the required length of barrel. The force acting on the ball is proportional to the square of the diameter, while the mass of the ball rises by the cube, so acceleration is slower; thus, the barrel can be shorter and therefore lighter. Long guns were also much heavier than carronades because they were over-specified to be capable of being double-shotted, whereas it was dangerous to do this in a carronade. A ship could carry more carronades, or carronades of a larger caliber, than long guns, and carronades could be mounted on the upper decks, where heavy long guns could cause the ship to be top-heavy and unstable. Carronades also required a smaller gun crew, which was very important for merchant ships, and they were faster to reload.

===Early use===

Carronades initially became popular on British merchant ships during the American Revolutionary War. A lightweight gun that needed only a small gun crew and was devastating at short range was well suited to defending merchant ships against French and American privateers. The French came in possession of their first carronades in December 1779 with the capture of the brig &quot;Finkastre&quot; by the frigate &quot;Précieuse&quot;, but the weapon was judged ineffective and was not adopted by them at the time. However, in the action of 4 September 1782, the impact of a single carronade broadside fired at close range by the frigate under Henry Trollope caused a wounded French captain to capitulate and surrender the &quot;Hébé&quot; after a short fight.

The Royal Navy was initially reluctant to adopt the guns, mainly due to mistrust of the Carron Company, which had developed a reputation for incompetence and commercial sharp dealing. Carronades were not even counted in numbering the guns of a ship. Lord Sandwich eventually started mounting them in place of the light guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck of ships. They soon proved their effectiveness in battle. French gun foundries were unable to produce equivalents for twenty years, so carronades gave British warships a significant tactical advantage during the latter part of the 18th century—though French ships mounted another type of weapon in the same role, the &quot;obusier de vaisseau&quot;. used the two 68-pounder carronades which she carried on her forecastle to great effect at the Battle of Trafalgar, clearing the gun deck of the by firing a round shot and a keg of 500 musket balls through the &quot;Bucentaure&quot;″s stern windows.

The carronade was initially very successful and widely adopted, and a few experimental ships were fitted with a carronade-only armament, such as and . &quot;Glatton&quot;, a fourth-rate ship with 56 guns, had a more destructive broadside at short range than HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, a first-rate ship with 100 guns. &quot;Glatton&quot; and &quot;Rainbow&quot; were both successful in battle, though the carronade&#x27;s lack of range was a tactical disadvantage of this arrangement against an opponent who could keep out of carronade range, but within the range of his long guns.

=== Decline ===
In the 1810s and 1820s, tactics started to place a greater emphasis on the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. Indeed, Captain David Porter of USS &quot;Essex&quot; complained when the navy replaced his 12-pounder long guns with 32-pounder carronades.

In the 1840s, the Royal Navy leased several carronade-armed clippers from Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. in 1840 to supplement the steamships it used against Qing dynasty China during the First Opium War.

The carronade was a popular armament among Anglo-American opium traffickers. Its light weight meant that opium traffickers could maintain both speed and asymmetrical force projection in Asia.

The carronade disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s, after improved methods for building cannons had been developed by William George Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Carronades were nevertheless still used in the American Civil War in the 1860s. The last known use of a carronade in conflict was during the First Boer War. In the siege of Potchefstroom, the Boers used &#x27;Ou Griet&#x27;, an antique carronade mounted on a wagon axle, against the British fort.

==Design==
The original design of the carronade included a different type of mounting on a wooden carriage, where the cannon itself had a projecting loop on the bottom that was pinned to the gun carriage, which was fastened to the side of the ship, with a pivoting mounting which allowed the gun to be rotated, while rearward recoil was contained, sometimes with a slider carriage. In some versions, a wedge was placed underneath the chamber to control elevation, while in later versions an elevating screw was used.

Carronades had a chamber that was one-caliber smaller than the bore; for example, an 18-pounder carronade had its chamber bored equal to a 12-pounder. This reduced the weight of the cannon, but also had the effect of reducing the velocity of the cannonball, and hence range. A factor mitigating the deficiency in range was that carronades could be bored with a much tighter windage than long guns, so that more of the propellant went to moving the shot, rather than bypassing it.

Naval artillery during the Age of Sail simply was not accurate, regardless of whether the cannon was a gun or a carronade. Almost all barrels were smoothbore, not rifled, and tolerances had wide variations on everything from the actual roundness and straightness of the barrel to shot size in relation to the bore (windage). Sights were rudimentary or non-existent, and elevation was controlled by wedges and guesswork. As a result, effective or decisive naval battles were generally fought at ranges under () where the carronade&#x27;s heavier ball was useful and its shorter range was not a huge problem. Technological improvements changed the capabilities of naval armament by the nineteenth century, but muzzle-loading smoothbore cannon were still not very accurate. Consequently, naval tactics in line of battle counted on the effect of rapid broadsides at short range, to which the carronade could make a significant contribution. In smaller vessels such as frigates, privateers, and raiders, the captains still appreciated long guns for their increased range, since they were not expected to engage in fighting in line-of-battle, but rather often found themselves engaged in long chases or attempts to work to windward. It was often better tactically to attempt to shoot the opponent&#x27;s rigging down at range rather than close in for direct combat, where the weaker hulls of lighter vessels were at risk. They also often found themselves far from home or harbors, where repairs and spare yards, masts or rigging could be found. Generally, although the power of the &quot;smashers&quot;, as they were called, was acknowledged, most captains continued to prefer long guns.

==Ordnance==

A carronade was much shorter and a third to a quarter of the weight of an equivalent long gun. A 32-pounder carronade, for example, weighed less than a ton, but a 32-pounder long gun weighed over 3 tons. Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun sizes: 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 32-, 42-, and 68-pounder versions are known.

The smaller carronades served in three roles. First, they often constituted the entire armament of unrated vessels. For instance, the &quot;Ballahoo&quot;- and &quot;Cuckoo&quot;-class schooners were armed only with four 12-pounder carronades. Second, gunboats such as those that the Americans deployed at the Battle of Lake Borgne often had one large 18-, 24-, or 32-pounder gun forward on a pivot, and two smaller carronades aft. Finally, larger vessels carried a few 12-, 18-, or 24-pounders to arm their ship&#x27;s boats—cutters, pinnaces, launches, barges, and the like—to give them firepower for boat actions. For instance, each of the 42 larger British vessels at the Battle of Lake Borgne carried a carronade in its bow; only the three gigs were unarmed.

At the other end, even a quite small vessel might carry the 68-pounders. For instance, Commander William Layman of the &quot;Cruizer&quot;-class brig sloop replaced her two forward 6-pounder guns and 32-pounder carronades with a single 68-pounder on a pivot, and then did the same with two of the aft 32-pounder carronades. By doing this, he replaced 70 pounds of broadside with 136 pounds (assuming that both 68-pounders would usually fire on the same side), and ensured that &quot;Raven&quot; would have less dead-space to her front and rear.

Carronades were not counted in a ship of the line″s rated number of guns. The classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can therefore mislead; they would often be carrying fewer guns but more pieces of ordnance than they were described as carrying. The same applied to the French and American navies when they adopted the carronade.

The carronade, like other naval guns, was mounted with ropes to restrain the recoil, but the details of the gun mounting were usually quite different. The carronade was typically mounted on a sliding rather than a wheeled gun carriage, and elevation was achieved with a turnscrew, like field guns, rather than the (wooden wedges) usual for naval guns. In addition, a carronade was usually mounted on a lug underneath the barrel, rather than the usual trunnions to either side. As a result, the carronade had an unusually high centre of gravity. Towards the end of the period of use, some carronades were fitted with trunnions to lower their centres of gravity, to create a variant known as the &quot;gunnade&quot;. Gunnades, introduced around 1820, are distinct from the earliest carronades, which also featured trunnions.

In the late 18th century, a new type of cannon was developed in Britain which was a cross between a cannon and a carronade, called a &quot;cannonade&quot; (not to be confused with the term &quot;cannonade&quot; which refers to rapid and sustained artillery fire or the act of firing as such). An example was the &quot;medium 18 pounder&quot;, which was shorter and lighter than a gun, yet longer than a carronade. While seemingly a good idea in theory, it was found that the gun was less accurate and shorter-ranged than a long cannon, less powerful than a carronade, and -at 28 cwt - too light for the powerful charge, meaning recoil was excessive and often broke the breachings or ropes which attached the gun to the hull timbers. They were quickly removed from service in most cases, although a number were retained on ships in merchant service, such as the East India Company, which were not generally expected to engage in combat. A number of the merchant ships in the Battle of Pulo Aura were armed with cannonades. This was a fight between a fleet of East India Company merchantmen under command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance and a French naval squadron under Admiral Linois; it was unusual for merchant ships to engage in combat, but they successfully beat off the French in series of engagements, convincing them they were actually facing a powerful force of Royal Navy vessels; this action was later used as the basis for the climactic battle in the book &quot;H.M.S Surprise,&quot; part of the famous Aubrey and Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian.

The East India Company (EIC) also used carronades, and these appear to be larger, and heavier than those that Royal Navy used. In his discussion of the single-ship action in which the French frigate &quot;Piémontaise&quot; captured the East Indiaman &quot;Warren Hastings&quot; on 11 June 1805, the naval historian William James compared the 18-pounder carronades on &quot;Warren Hastings&quot; with the 18-pounder carronades that the British Royal Navy used. The EIC 18-pounder was long, and weighed 15.5 cwt; the Royal Navy&#x27;s 18-pounder carronade was and weighed 10.5 cwt (). James&#x27;s figures show the EIC&#x27;s 12-pounder carronades were long, and weighed 8.5 cwt (); the Royal Navy&#x27;s 12-pounder carronade was and weighed 6.5 cwt ().

==Range==
There was usually a considerable gap (known as windage) between the ball and the inside of the gun barrel, as a result of irregularities in the size of cannonballs and the difficulty of boring out gun barrels. If the windage of a cannon was off as much as a quarter of an inch (), it could cause a considerable loss in power and accuracy. The manufacturing practices introduced by the Carron Company reduced the windage considerably. Despite the reduced windage, carronades had a much shorter range than the equivalent long gun, typically a third to a half, because they used a much smaller propellant charge (the chamber for the powder was smaller than the bore for the ball). Typical naval tactics in the late 18th century, however, emphasised short-range broadsides, so the range was not thought to be a problem.

The air resistance of a spherical cannonball in supersonic flight is much greater than in subsonic flight. For a given weight of powder, a larger ball, having a large mass, has a lower maximum velocity which reduces the range of supersonic flight. But the increase in the distance of subsonic flight may have more than compensated, as the air resistance is proportional to the square of the diameter but the mass is proportional to the cube. The &quot;Victory&quot;″s 68 lb carronade is reported to have had a maximum range of at an angle of 5 degrees with a 5 lb charge of gunpowder. The structure of &quot;Victory&quot;″s forecastle limited the weight of the guns. The other gun on the forecastle was a medium 12 lb cannon, which had a maximum range of . Carronades were not noticeably short range for either the weight of the gun or the gunpowder charge. Carronades were short range because of their small gunpowder charge but their lower muzzle velocity required a higher trajectory. But at sea the range of the long gun had little use; guns were on moving platforms, making timing of fire very difficult. Pitch and roll meant that most ships fought at close range of a few hundred yards or less. In battles between warships, carronades could be at a disadvantage if they were fought outside their point blank range, such as in the case of USS &quot;Essex&quot;, a frigate equipped almost solely with carronades, which was reduced to a hulk by the longer-range guns of HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; and HMS &quot;Cherub&quot; off Valparaiso, Chile in the March 28, 1814 Battle of Valparaiso. Warships often aimed at the enemy&#x27;s hull to destroy its capacity for battle. A ball fired from a cannon on the downward roll of the ship would often ricochet off the sea into the enemy hull. A merchant ship would more often aim at the bigger target of the masts and rigging in the hope of escaping a pursuing enemy. The higher trajectory required of carronades at ranges of or more was little disadvantage for their use by merchant ships or any naval ship fleeing a more powerful enemy. The theory for centuries had always associated long barrels with long range, but experience had also shown that shortening the barrel did not reduce performance as much as expected (e.g., the English musket barrel between 1630 and 1660 went down from in length.).

<text>A ship of the line was a type of naval warship constructed during the Age of Sail from the 17th century to the mid-19th century. The ship of the line was designed for the naval tactic known as the line of battle, which involved the two columns of opposing warships manoeuvering to volley fire with the cannons along their broadsides. In conflicts where opposing ships were both able to fire from their broadsides, the faction with more cannons firingand therefore more firepowertypically had an advantage.

From the end of the 1840s, the introduction of steam power brought less dependence on the wind in battle and led to the construction of screw-driven wooden-hulled ships of the line; a number of purely sail-powered ships were converted to this propulsion mechanism. However, the rise of the ironclad frigate, starting in 1859, made steam-assisted ships of the line obsolete. The ironclad warship was predecessor to the 20th-century battleship, whose very designation is itself a contraction of the phrase &quot;ship of the line of battle&quot; or, more colloquially, &quot;battleship of the line&quot;.

The term &quot;ship of the line&quot; fell into disuse except in historical contexts, after warships and naval tactics evolved and changed from the mid-19th century. Some other languages did keep the name however; the Imperial German Navy called its battleships &quot;Linienschiffe&quot; until World War I.

==History==

===Predecessors===

The heavily armed carrack, first developed in Portugal for either trade or war in the Atlantic Ocean, was the precursor of the &quot;ship of the line&quot;. Other maritime European states quickly adopted it in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. These vessels were developed by fusing aspects of the cog of the North Sea and galley of the Mediterranean Sea. The cogs, which traded in the North Sea, in the Baltic Sea and along the Atlantic coasts, had an advantage over galleys in battle because they had raised platforms called &quot;castles&quot; at bow and stern that archers could occupy to fire down on enemy ships or even to drop heavy weights from. At the bow, for instance, the castle was called the forecastle (usually contracted as fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle or fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le, and pronounced FOHK-səl). Over time these castles became higher and larger, and eventually were built into the structure of the ship, increasing overall strength. This aspect of the cog remained in the newer-style carrack designs and proved its worth in battles like that at Diu in 1509.

The &quot;Mary Rose&quot; was an early 16th-century English carrack or &quot;great ship&quot;. She was heavily armed with 78 guns and 91 after an upgrade in the 1530s. Built in Portsmouth in 1510–1512, she was one of the earliest purpose-built men-of-war in the English navy. She was over 500 tons burthen and had a keel of over and a crew of over 200 sailors, composed of 185 soldiers and 30 gunners. Although the pride of the English fleet, she accidentally sank during the Battle of the Solent, 19 July 1545.

&quot;Henri Grâce à Dieu&quot; (English: &quot;Henry Grace of God&quot;), nicknamed &quot;Great Harry&quot;, was another early English carrack. Contemporary with &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, &quot;Henri Grâce à Dieu&quot; was long, measuring 1,000–1,500 tons burthen and having a complement of 700–1,000. She was ordered by Henry VIII in response to the Scottish ship &quot;Michael&quot;, launched in 1511. She was originally built at Woolwich Dockyard from 1512 to 1514 and was one of the first vessels to feature gunports and had twenty of the new heavy bronze cannon, allowing for a broadside. In all, she mounted 43 heavy guns and 141 light guns. She was the first English two-decker, and when launched she was the largest and most powerful warship in Europe, but she saw little action. She was present at the Battle of the Solent against Francis I of France in 1545 (in which &quot;Mary Rose&quot; sank) but appears to have been more of a diplomatic vessel, sailing on occasion with sails of gold cloth. Indeed, the great ships were almost as well known for their ornamental design (some ships, like the &quot;Vasa&quot;, were gilded on their stern scrollwork) as they were for the power they possessed.

Carracks fitted for war carried large-calibre guns aboard. Because of their higher freeboard and greater load-bearing ability, this type of vessel was better suited than the galley to wield gunpowder weapons. Because of their development for conditions in the Atlantic, these ships were more weatherly than galleys and better suited to open waters. The lack of oars meant that large crews were unnecessary, making long journeys more feasible. Their disadvantage was that they were entirely reliant on the wind for mobility. Galleys could still overwhelm great ships, especially when there was little wind and they had a numerical advantage, but as great ships increased in size, galleys became less and less useful.

Another detriment was the high forecastle, which interfered with the sailing qualities of the ship; the bow would be forced low into the water while sailing before the wind. But as guns were introduced and gunfire replaced boarding as the primary means of naval combat during the 16th century, the medieval forecastle was no longer needed, and later ships such as the galleon had only a low, one-deck-high forecastle. By the time of the 1637 launching of England&#x27;s &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;, the forecastle had disappeared altogether.

During the 16th century the galleon evolved from the carrack. It was a narrower ship, with a much reduced forecastle, and was much more manoeuvrable than the carrack. It was particularly favored from an early date by the Spanish for their trans-Atlantic trade. The main ships of the English and Spanish fleets in the Battle of Gravelines of 1588 were galleons; all of the English and most of the Spanish galleons survived the battle and the great storm on the voyage home, even though the Spanish galleons had suffered the heaviest attacks from the English while regrouping their scattered fleet. By the 17th century every major European naval power was building ships like these.

With the growing importance of colonies and exploration and the need to maintain trade routes across stormy oceans, galleys and galleasses (a larger, higher type of galley with side-mounted guns, but lower than a galleon) were used less and less, and only in ever more restricted purposes and areas, so that by about 1750, with a few notable exceptions, they were of little use in naval battles.

===Line-of-battle adoption===
King Erik XIV of Sweden initiated construction of the ship in 1563; this might have been the first attempt of this battle tactic, roughly 50 years ahead of widespread adoption of the line of battle strategy. &quot;Mars&quot; was likely the largest ship in the world at the time of her build, equipped with 107 guns at a full-length of . &quot;Mars&quot; became the first ship to be sunk by gunfire from other ships in a naval battle.

In the early to mid-17th century, several navies, particularly those of the Netherlands and England, began to use new fighting techniques. Previously battles had usually been fought by great fleets of ships closing with each other and fighting in whatever arrangement they found themselves in, often boarding enemy vessels as opportunities presented themselves. As the use of broadsides (coordinated fire by the battery of cannon on one side of a warship) became increasingly dominant in battle, tactics changed. The evolving &quot;line-of-battle&quot; tactic, first used in an ad hoc way, required ships to form single-file lines and close with the enemy fleet on the same tack, battering the enemy fleet until one side had had enough and retreated. Any manoeuvres would be carried out with the ships remaining in line for mutual protection.

In order that this order of battle, this long thin line of guns, may not be injured or broken at some point weaker than the rest, there is at the same time felt the necessity of putting in it only ships which, if not of equal force, have at least equally strong sides. Logically it follows, at the same moment in which the line ahead became definitively the order for battle, there was established the distinction between the ships &#x27;of the line&#x27;, alone destined for a place therein, and the lighter ships meant for other uses.

The lighter ships were used for various functions, including acting as scouts, and relaying signals between the flagship and the rest of the fleet. This was necessary because from the flagship, only a small part of the line would be in clear sight.

The adoption of line-of-battle tactics had consequences for ship design. The height advantage given by the castles fore and aft was reduced, now that hand-to-hand combat was less essential. The need to manoeuvre in battle made the top weight of the castles more of a disadvantage. So they shrank, making the ship of the line lighter and more manoeuvrable than its forebears for the same combat power. As an added consequence, the hull itself grew larger, allowing the size and number of guns to increase as well.

===Evolution of design===
In the 17th century fleets could consist of almost a hundred ships of various sizes, but by the middle of the 18th century, ship-of-the-line design had settled on a few standard types: older two-deckers (i.e., with two complete decks of guns firing through side ports) of 50 guns (which were too weak for the battle line but could be used to escort convoys), two-deckers of between 64 and 90 guns that formed the main part of the fleet, and larger three- or even four-deckers with 98 to 140 guns that served as admirals&#x27; command ships. Fleets consisting of perhaps 10 to 25 of these ships, with their attendant supply ships and scouting and messenger frigates, kept control of the sea lanes for major European naval powers whilst restricting the sea-borne trade of enemies.

The most common size of sail ship of the line was the &quot;74&quot; (named for its 74 guns), originally developed by France in the 1730s, and later adopted by all battleship navies. Until this time the British had 6 sizes of ship of the line, and they found that their smaller 50- and 60-gun ships were becoming too small for the battle line, while their 80s and over were three-deckers and therefore unwieldy and unstable in heavy seas. Their best were 70-gun three-deckers of about long on the gundeck, while the new French 74s were around . In 1747 the British captured a few of these French ships during the War of Austrian Succession. In the next decade Thomas Slade (Surveyor of the Navy from 1755, along with co-Surveyor William Bately) broke away from the past and designed several new classes of 74s to compete with these French designs, starting with the and classes. Their successors gradually improved handling and size through the 1780s. Other navies ended up building 74s also as they had the right balance between offensive power, cost, and manoeuvrability. Eventually around half of Britain&#x27;s ships of the line were 74s. Larger vessels were still built, as command ships, but they were more useful only if they could definitely get close to an enemy, rather than in a battle involving chasing or manoeuvring. The 74 remained the favoured ship until 1811, when Seppings&#x27;s method of construction enabled bigger ships to be built with more stability.

In a few ships the design was altered long after the ship was launched and in service. In the Royal Navy, smaller two-deck 74- or 64-gun ships of the line that could not be used safely in fleet actions had their upper decks removed (or &quot;razeed&quot;), resulting in a very stout, single-gun-deck warship called a &quot;razee&quot;. The resulting razeed ship could be classed as a frigate and was still much stronger. The most successful razeed ship in the Royal Navy was , commanded by Sir Edward Pellew.
The Spanish ship , was a Spanish first-rate ship of the line with 112 guns. This was increased in 1795–96 to 130 guns by closing in the spar deck between the quarterdeck and forecastle, and around 1802 to 140 guns, thus creating what was in effect a continuous fourth gundeck although the extra guns added were actually relatively small. She was the heaviest-armed ship in the world when rebuilt, and bore the most guns of any ship of the line outfitted in the Age of Sail.

 (1829), ordered by the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and built by the Imperial Naval Arsenal on the Golden Horn in Istanbul, was for many years the largest warship in the world. The ship of the line was armed with 128 cannons on three decks and was manned by 1,280 sailors. She participated in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) during the Crimean War (1854–1856). She was decommissioned in 1874.

The second largest sailing three-decker ship of the line ever built in the West and the biggest French ship of the line was the , launched in 1847. She had vertical sides, which increased significantly the space available for upper batteries, but reduced the stability of the ship; wooden stabilisers were added under the waterline to address the issue. &quot;Valmy&quot; was thought to be the largest sort of sailing ship possible, as larger dimensions made the manoeuvre of riggings impractical with mere manpower. She participated in the Crimean War, and after her return to France later housed the French Naval Academy under the name &quot;Borda&quot; from 1864 to 1890.

===Steam power===
The first major change to the ship-of-the-line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system. The first military uses of steamships came in the 1810s, and in the 1820s a number of navies experimented with paddle steamer warships. Their use spread in the 1830s, with paddle-steamer warships participating in conflicts like the First Opium War alongside ships of the line and frigates.

Paddle steamers, however, had major disadvantages. The paddle wheel above the waterline was exposed to enemy fire, while itself preventing the ship from firing broadsides effectively. During the 1840s, the screw propeller emerged as the most likely method of steam propulsion, with both Britain and the US launching screw-propelled warships in 1843. Through the 1840s, the British and French navies launched ever larger and more powerful screw ships, alongside sail-powered ships of the line. In 1845, Viscount Palmerston gave an indication of the role of the new steamships in tense Anglo-French relations, describing the English Channel as a &quot;steam bridge&quot;, rather than a barrier to French invasion. It was partly because of the fear of war with France that the Royal Navy converted several old 74-gun ships of the line into 60-gun steam-powered blockships (following the model of Fulton&#x27;s ), starting in 1845. The blockships were &quot;originally conceived as steam batteries solely for harbour defence, but in September 1845 they were given a reduced [sailing] rig rather than none at all, to make them sea-going ships.… The blockships were to be a cost-effective experiment of great value.&quot; They subsequently gave good service in the Crimean War.

The French Navy, however, developed the first purpose-built steam battleship with the 90-gun in 1850. She is also considered the first true steam battleship, and the first screw battleship ever. &quot;Napoléon&quot; was armed as a conventional ship of the line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of , regardless of the wind conditionsa potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.

Eight sister ships to &quot;Napoléon&quot; were built in France over a period of ten years, but the United Kingdom soon took the lead in production, in number of both purpose-built and converted units. Altogether, France built 10 new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older battleship units, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.

In the end, France and Britain were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made some use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates. These included Russia, Turkey, Sweden, Naples, Prussia, Denmark, and Austria.

===Decline===
In the Crimean War, six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed seven Ottoman frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the Battle of Sinop in 1853.

In the 1860s unarmoured steam line-of-battle ships were replaced by ironclad warships. In the American Civil War, on March 8, 1862, during the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads, two unarmoured Union wooden frigates were sunk and destroyed by the Confederate ironclad .

However, the power implied by the ship of the line would find its way into the ironclad, which would develop during the next few decades into the concept of the battleship.

Several navies still use terms equivalent to the &quot;ship of the line&quot; for battleships, including the German (&quot;Linienschiff&quot;) and Russian (&quot;lineyniy korabl`&quot; (лине́йный кора́бль) or &quot;linkor&quot; (линкор) in short) navies.

== Combat ==
In the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean, the fleets of the Royal Navy, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal fought numerous battles. In the Baltic, the Scandinavian kingdoms and Russia did likewise, while in the Mediterranean Sea, the Ottoman Empire, Spain, France, Britain and the various Barbary pirates battled.

By the eighteenth century, the UK had established itself as the world&#x27;s preeminent naval power. Attempts by Napoleon to challenge the Royal Navy&#x27;s dominance at sea proved a colossal failure. During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain defeated French and allied fleets decisively all over the world including in the Caribbean at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, the Bay of Aboukir off the Egyptian coast at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, near Spain at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, and in the second Battle of Copenhagen (1807). The UK emerged from the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 with the largest and most professional navy in the world, composed of hundreds of wooden, sail-powered ships of all sizes and classes.

Overwhelming firepower was of no use if it could not be brought to bear which was not always possible against the smaller leaner ships used by Napoleon&#x27;s privateers, operating from French New World territories. The Royal Navy compensated by deploying numerous Bermuda sloops. Similarly, many of the East India Company&#x27;s merchant vessels became lightly armed and quite competent in combat during this period, operating a convoy system under an armed merchantman, instead of depending on small numbers of more heavily armed ships which while effective, slowed the flow of commerce.

==Restorations and preservation==

The only original ship of the line remaining today is HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, preserved as a museum in Portsmouth to appear as she was while under Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Although &quot;Victory&quot; has been in dry dock since the 1920s, she is still a fully commissioned warship in the Royal Navy and is the oldest commissioned warship in any navy worldwide.

&quot;Regalskeppet Vasa&quot; sank in lake Mälaren in 1628 and was lost until 1956. She was then raised intact, in remarkably good condition, in 1961 and is presently on display at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. At the time she was the largest Swedish warship ever built. Today the &quot;Vasa&quot; Museum is the most visited museum in Sweden.

The last ship-of-the-line afloat was the French ship &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, renamed after being captured by the British, which survived until 1949. The last ship-of-the-line to be sunk by enemy action was , which was sunk by an air raid in 1940, during the Second World War; she was briefly re-floated in 1948 before being broken up.

<doc id="93100" wikidata="Q7849683" url="?curid=93100" title="Tsimshian mythology">
<text>Tsimshian mythology is the mythology of the Tsimshian, an Aboriginal people in Canada and a Native American tribe in the United States. The majority of Tsimshian people live in British Columbia, while others live in Alaska.

Tsmishian myth is known from orally-passed tales. An &quot;adaawx&quot;(or true tellings) is a story concerning animal spirits in human guise and is usually linked to the origin of the Earth and the peoples on it. A &quot;malesk&quot;, in contrast, is an adventure or history tale that purports to entertain rather than explain.

The Raven spirit is known as &quot;We-gyet&quot; or &quot;Txamsem&quot;. Txamsem is said to have a brother named &quot;Logobola&quot; who is responsible for the lack of fresh and clear water as well as the existence of the fog into which Txamsem became lost.

==The Raven==
The Raven, known as Txamsem or Giant, is a central figure in Tsimshian mythology, part of the Raven Tales mythology connecting the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. The Raven is viewed as the creator of the universe and an intermediary between its physical and spiritual incarnations.

Tsimshian creation myth presupposes a dark and still universe populated by a variety of animal spirits. An animal chief pampers his son, causing him to fall sick and die, and his intestines are burned. The next day a new youth appears in the bed,
healthy and visible in the darkness, &quot;bright as fire.&quot; The boy is adopted by the chief. Initially, this boy does not eat, but slave spirits trick him into eating scabs. This triggers an enormous appetite in the boy, who begins to eat so much that the chief and villagers send him away with a raven blanket. The boy leaves, and becomes Raven.

As Raven arrives in the mainland, he is insatiably hungry, causing great disruptions to those he meets. At various points of the myth he serves as a trickster. For example, after creating a slave from rotted wood, he disguises himself as a king and arrives in a village. The villagers tell the slave to invite Raven for dinner, but the slave says Raven is not hungry, and takes the food for himself. Raven builds a bridge from cabbage and as the slave crosses, he falls to his death. Raven descends into the valley to eat the food from the dead slave&#x27;s belly.

As Raven begins to develop a sense of generosity, he hosts a potlatch, in which he shares food with many guests. As he speaks, he wishes they would all turn to stone, and they do, giving form to a previously immaterial world.

<doc id="93101" wikidata="Q644057" url="?curid=93101" title="Vincent of Lérins">
<text>Vincent of Lérins (; died ) was a Gallic monk and author of early Christian writings. One example was the &quot;Commonitorium&quot;, c.434, which offers guidance in the orthodox teaching of Christianity. Suspected of semi-Pelagianism, he opposed the Augustinian model of grace and was probably the recipient of Prosper of Aquitaine&#x27;s &quot;Responsiones ad Capitula Objectionum Vincentianarum&quot;. His feast day is celebrated on 24 May.

==Personal life==
Vincent of Lérins was born in Toulouse, Gaul, to a noble family, and he is believed to be the brother of Lupus of Troyes. In his early life he engaged in secular pursuits; it is unclear whether these were civil or military, though the term he uses, , may imply the latter. He entered Lérins Abbey on Île Saint-Honorat, where under the pseudonym Peregrinus he wrote the &quot;Commonitorium&quot; , about three years after the Council of Ephesus. Vincent defended the Marian title of &quot;Theotokos&quot; (God-bearer) in opposition to the teachings of Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople, which were condemned by the Council of Ephesus. Eucherius of Lyon called him a &quot;conspicuously eloquent and knowledgeable&quot; holy man.

Gennadius of Massilia wrote that Vincent died during the reigns of the Roman Emperor Theodosius II in the East and Valentinian III in the West. Therefore, his death must have occurred in or before the year 450. His relics are preserved at Lérins. Caesar Baronius included his name in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, but Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont doubted whether there was sufficient reason. He is commemorated on 24 May.

==&quot;Commonitory&quot;==
Vincent wrote his &quot;Commonitory&quot; to provide himself with a general rule to distinguish Catholic truth from heresy, committing it to writing as a reference. It is known for Vincent&#x27;s famous maxim: &quot;Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself, all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all.&quot; The currently accepted idea that Vincent was a semi-Pelagian is attributed to a 17th-century Protestant theologian, Gerardus Vossius, and developed in the 17th century by Cardinal Henry Noris. Evidence of Vincent&#x27;s semi-Pelagianism, according to Reginald Moxon, is Vincent&#x27;s &quot;great vehemence against&quot; the doctrines of Augustine of Hippo in &quot;Commonitory&quot;.

Pope Francis has quoted Vincent&#x27;s &quot;Commonitory&quot; on several occasions, notably his words on doctrine and the progress of doctrine: &quot;The dogma of the Christian religion must follow these laws. It progresses, consolidating over the years, developing with time, deepening with age.&quot;

==Semi-Pelagianism==
Semi-Pelagianism was a doctrine of grace advocated by monks in and around Marseille in Southern Gaul after 428. It aimed at a compromise between the two extremes of Pelagianism and Augustinianism, and was condemned as heresy at the Second Council of Orange in 529 AD after more than a century of disputes.

Augustine wrote of prevenient grace and expanded to a discussion of predestination. A number of monastic communities took exception to the latter because it seemed to nullify the value of asceticism practised under their rules. John Cassian felt that Augustine&#x27;s stress on predestination ruled out any need for human cooperation or consent.

Vincent was suspected of semi-Pelagianism but whether he actually held that doctrine is not clear as it is not found in the &quot;Commonitorium&quot;. But it is probable that his sympathies were with those who held it. Considering that the monks of the Lérins Islands – like the general body of clergy of Southern Gaul – were semi-Pelagians, it is not surprising that Vincent was suspected of semi-Pelagianism. It is also possible that Vincent held to a position closer to the Eastern Orthodox position of today, which they claim to have been virtually universal until the time of Augustine, and which may have been interpreted as semi-Pelagian by Augustine&#x27;s followers.

Vincent upheld tradition and seemed to have objected to much of Augustine&#x27;s work as &quot;new&quot; theology. He shared Cassian&#x27;s reservations about Augustine&#x27;s views on the role of grace. In the &quot;Commonitorium&quot; he listed theologians and teachers who, in his view, had made significant contributions to the defence and spreading of the Gospel; he omitted Augustine from that list. Some commentators have viewed Cassian and Vincent as &quot;semi-Augustinian&quot; rather than semi-Pelagian.

It is a matter of academic debate whether Vincent is the author of the &quot;Objectiones Vincentianae&quot;, a collection of sixteen inferences allegedly deduced from Augustine&#x27;s writings, which is lost and only known through Prosper of Aquitaine&#x27;s rejoinder, &quot;Responsiones ad capitula objectionum Vincentianarum&quot;. It is dated close to the time of the &quot;Commonitorium&quot; and its animus is very similar to the &quot;Commonitorium&quot; sections 70 and 86, making it possible that both were written by the same author.

<text>The History of the Haudenosaunee includes the creation stories and folktales of the Native Americans who formed the confederacy of the Five Nations Iroquois, later the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. Historically, these stories were recorded in wampum and recited, only being written down later. In the written versions, the spellings of names differ due to transliteration and spelling variations in European languages that were not yet standardized. Variants of the stories exist, reflecting different localities and times.

== Oral traditions ==
The Haudenosaunee have passed down their stories as a centuries-old oral tradition. Through these stories, listeners learn values, laws, and acceptable behaviors in their communities. For example, &quot;Girl Who Was Not Satisfied&quot; is a traditional story about a girl who runs off with a man for his looks. The moral of the story is to judge people based on their character, not their looks. The story also teaches people the importance of valuing what they already have.

Haudenosaunee storytelling is also entertainment and a way to preserve culture. The stories reflect the Iroquois&#x27; perception and understanding of the world. Traditionally, the stories were poetic and delivered in metaphors. However, translations often lose the expressive qualities which existed in the original language. It is also possible that Christianity influenced the written mythologies.

In 1923, historian Arthur C. Parker wrote, &quot;There is an amazing lack of authentic material on Iroquois-folklore, though much of what arrogates this name itself has been written. The writers, however, have in general so glossed the native themes with poetic and literary interpretations that the material has shrunken in value and can scarcely be considered without many reservations.&quot; 
Each Haudenosaunee village had a Hage&#x27;ota or storyteller who was responsible for learning and memorizing the ganondas&#x27;hag or stories. Traditionally, no stories were told during the summer months in accordance with the law of the (). Violators were said to suffer an omen or great evils, such as a being stung on the lips by a bee or being strangled by a snake while sleeping. The Haudenosaunee believed that telling the stories in summer would make the animals, plants, trees, and humans lazy, as work stops for a good story.

== Stories ==
Following are examples of Iroquois myths, as recorded by Harriet Maxwell Converse in 1908, Arthur C. Parker in 1923, and others.

=== Creation ===
The Earth was a thought in the mind of 
(), the ruler of a great island floating above the clouds. The floating island is a place of calm where all needs are provided and there is no pain or death. The island&#x27;s inhabitants hold council under a great apple tree.

Hawëni:yo’ says, &quot;Let us make a new place where another people can grow. Under our council tree is a great sea of clouds which calls out for light.&quot; He orders the uprooting of the council tree and he looks through the hole, down into the depths. He tells (Mohawk:) () to look down. Hearing the voice of the sea below calling, Hawëni:yo’ tells Awëöha’i’, who was pregnant, to bring it life. He wraps her in light and drops her down through the hole.

All the birds and animals who live in the great cloud sea are panicked. The Duck asks, &quot;Where can it rest?&quot; The Beaver replies, &quot;Only the oeh-dah () from the bottom of our great sea can hold it. I will get some.&quot; The Beaver dives down but never returns. Then, the Duck tries, but its dead body floats to the surface. Many of the other birds and animals try and fail. 

Finally, the Muskrat returns with some Oeh-dah in his paws. He says, &quot;It&#x27;s heavy. Who can support it?&quot; The Turtle volunteers and the oeh-dah is placed on top of his shell. The birds fly up and carry Awëöha’i’ on their wings to the Turtle&#x27;s back. This is how Hah-nu-nah, the Turtle, came to be the earth bearer. When he moves, the sea gets rough and the earth shakes.

=== The Do-yo-da-no ===
Once brought to the surface, the oeh-dah from the sea floor grows and forms an island. Ata-en-sic () goes to the island, knowing her time to give birth is near. She hears two voices under her heart. One voice is calm and quiet, but the other is loud and angry. Her children are the Do-yo-da-no or the Twin Gods. The good twin, Hah-gweh-di-yu or Teharonhiakwako (), is born normally; the evil twin, Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh or Sawiskera (), forces his way out from under his mother&#x27;s arm, killing her during childbirth.

After the death of Ata-en-sic, the island is shrouded in gloom. Hah-gweh-di-yu shapes the sky and creates the Sun from his mother&#x27;s face saying, &quot;You shall rule here where your face will shine forever.&quot; However, Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh sets the great darkness in the west to drive down the Sun. Hah-gweh-di-yu then takes the Moon and stars, his sisters, from his mother&#x27;s breast and places them to guard the night sky. He gives his mother&#x27;s body to the earth, the Great Mother from whom all life came.

Ga-gaah, the Crow, comes from the sun land carrying a grain of corn in his ear. Hah-gweh-di-yu plants the corn above his mother&#x27;s body and it becomes the first grain. Ga-gaah hovers over the corn fields, guarding them against harm and claiming his share.

Aid by assistants or subordinate spirits such as the Huron spirit Ioskeha, Hah-gweh-di-yu creates the first people, heals disease, defeats demons, and gives the Iroquois many magical and ceremonial rituals. Another of his gifts is tobacco, a central part of the Iroquois religion. In contrast, Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh brings dangerous and destructive things to the world. Thus, the Do-yo-da-no creation myth is also about the behaviors and morals of people.

==== Notes ====
=== The De-oh-há-ko ===
The Iroquois name De-oh-há-ko means Our Life or Our Supporters. Often called the Three Sisters, the De-oh-há-ko are the spirits of the corn, beans, and squash.

In one variant of the myth of Ata-en-sic, the Three Sisters grew from her daughter Tekawerahkwa&#x27;s dead body. According to this version, Ata-en-sic has a daughter named Tekawerahkwa (), whom the west wind impregnates with Hah-gweh-di-yu and Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh. As Tekawerahkwa dies by childbirth, either she wishes for her body to sustain the people or Ata-en-sic sows on her grave the seeds she had brought when she fell to Earth, but never planted before. From Tekawerahkwa&#x27;s body parts grow various crops: the spirits of the corn, beans, and squash come from her breasts, hands, and navel respectively; sunflowers from her legs; strawberries from her heart; tobacco from her head; and purple potatoes or sunchokes from her feet.

The Three Sisters appear as beautiful maidens. They are fond of each other and like to live near each other. This is an analogy to the three plants which are historically interplanted.

One day while O-na-tah, the spirit of the corn, is wandering alone, she is captured by the evil Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh. Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh sends one of his monsters to devastate the fields, and the other sisters run away. Hä-qweh-da-ět-gǎh holds O-na-tah captive in darkness under the earth until a searching ray of sunlight reached the surface. Back on the Earth&#x27;s surface, she weeps over the devastation to her fields and her abandonment by her sisters. She vows to never again leave her fields, which she guards alone, without her sisters.

It is said that in 1779, the spirits of the Three Sisters visited Seneca Chief Handsome Lake as he wished to join the Iroquois lives lost to the US military&#x27;s attacks. Inspired by the Three Sisters&#x27; visit, Handsome Lake returned to his community, re-teaching it the traditional Iroquois agricultural practices.

=== Hé-no ===

Iroquois mythology tells of Hé-no, the spirit of thunder who brings rain to nourish the crops. The Iroquois address Hé-no as Tisote (). He appears as a warrior, wearing on his head a magic feather that makes him invulnerable to the attacks of Hah-gweh-di-yu. On his back, he carries a basket filled with pieces of chert which he throws at evil spirits and witches. 

Hé-no lives in a cave under Niagara Falls. At that time, a young girl lives above the falls and is engaged to marry a disagreeable old man. Rather than marry, she climbs into a canoe and heads down the river. The girl and the canoe are carried over the falls; the canoe is seen falling to destruction, but the girl disappears. Hé-no and his two assistants catch her in a blanket and take her to his cave. One of the assistants is taken with her beauty and marries her.

Later, Hé-no rescues her village from a huge serpent that was devastating it with diseases. He lures the serpent to a spot on Buffalo Creek where he strikes it with a thunderbolt. Fatally wounded, the serpent tries to escape to the safety of Lake Erie but dies before he gets away. His body floats downstream to the head of Niagara Falls, stretching nearly across the river and arching backward to form a dam. The dammed water breaks the rocks, and the snake&#x27;s body falls onto the rocks below. This forms Horseshoe Falls but destroys Hé-no&#x27;s home in the process.

=== Jo-ga-oh ===
Iroquois myths tell of the (Jo-gä-oh) or the Little People. The are invisible nature spirits, similar to the fairies of European myth. They protect and guide the natural world and protect people from unseen hidden enemies. There are three tribes of .

The first tribe is the Ga-hon-ga who inhabit rivers and rocks. They live in rocky caves beside streams and have great strength despite their small stature. The Ga-hon-ga enjoy feats of strength and enjoy inviting people to their habitations to compete in contests. They enjoy playing ball with rocks, tossing the rocks high in the air, so they are often called Stone Throwers.

The second tribe is the Gan-da-yah who protect and advise the fruits and grains. Throughout the growing season, the Gan-da-yah guards crops against disease and other pests. Their special gift is the strawberry plant; in the spring they loosen the earth so it can grow. They turn strawberry leaves toward the sun and guide their runners. When the strawberries ripen, the () hold the spring festival with its nighttime dances of thanksgiving to the . They sometimes visit the people in the form of a robin for good news, an owl for a warning, or a bat for an imminent life-and-death struggle. Believers in the Gan-da-yah say, &quot;The most minute harmless insect or worm may be the bearer of important &#x27;talk&#x27; from the &#x27;Little People&#x27; and is not destroyed for the &#x27;trail is broad enough for all.. 

The third tribe of are the Oh-do-was, who inhabit the shadowy places under the earth. In this underworld, there are forests and animals, including a white buffalo. The Oh-do-was guard against poisonous snakes and creatures of death that try to escape from the underworld. Occasionally, the Oh-do-was emerge from the underworld at night and visit the world above where they hold festivals and dance in rings around trees. Afterward, grass will not grow in the ring.

=== Gǎ-oh ===
Iroquois myths tell of Gaoh, the personification of the wind. He is a giant and an &quot;instrumentality through whom the Great Spirit moves the elements&quot;. His home is in the far northern sky. He controls the four winds: north wind (Bear), west wind (Panther), east wind (Moose), and south wind (Fawn).

The North Wind is personified by a bear spirit named Ya-o-gah. Ya-o-gah can destroy the world with his fiercely cold breath but is kept in check by Gǎ-oh. Ne-o-ga, the south wind, is as &quot;gentle, and kind as the sunbeam&quot;. The West Wind, the panther Da-jo-ji, &quot;can climb the high mountains, and tear down the forests...carry the whirlwind on [his] back, and toss the great sea waves high in the air, and snarl at the tempests&quot;. O-yan-do-ne, the east wind, blows his breath &quot;to chill the young clouds as they float through the sky&quot;.

=== So-son-do-wah ===
According to Iroquois mythology, So-son-do-wah is a great hunter, known for stalking a supernatural elk. He is captured by Dawn, a goddess who needs him as a watchman. So-son-do-wah falls in love with the human woman Gendenwitha (, alternate spelling: Gendewitha). He tried to woo her with song. In spring, he sings as a bluebird, in summer as a blackbird, and in autumn as a hawk. The hawk tries to take Gendenwitha into the sky with him. However, Dawn ties So-son-do-wah to her doorpost. She changes Gendenwitha into the Morning Star, so the hunter can watch her all night but never be with her.

=== Flying Head ===

Iroquois mythology tells of the Flying Head (Mohawk ), a monster in the form of a giant disembodied head as tall as a man. It is covered with thick hair and has long black wings and long sharp claws. At night, the Flying Head comes to the homes of widows and orphans, beating its wings on the walls of the houses and issuing terrifying cries in an unknown language. A few days after the Flying Head visits, a death claims one of the family. The Seneca name for the Flying Head is , meaning whirlwind.

=== Djodi&#x27;kwado ===
According to Iroquois mythology, Djodi&#x27;kwado&#x27; is a horned serpent who inhabits the depths of rivers and lakes. He is capable of taking the form of a man and seducing young women. He is prominent in the tales &quot;Thunder Destroys Horned Snake&quot;. and &quot;The Horned Serpent Runs Away with a Young Wife who is Rescued by the Thunderer&quot;. In the latter, he appears as a helpful being, although his help is less than useful. Hé-no attacks and may have killed Djodi&#x27;kwado&#x27;.

=== Tuscarora legend ===
William Byrd II recorded a tradition of a former religious leader from the Tuscarora tribe, in his &quot;History of the Dividing Line Betwixt North Carolina and Virginia&quot; (1728), The Tuscarora are an Iroquoian-speaking tribe, historically settled in North Carolina, that migrated to the Iroquois Confederacy in New York because of warfare. According to Byrd:

=== The Three Brothers ===
This is an Iroquois sun myth about three brothers who tire of being on Earth and decide to chase the Sun into the sky. Two of the brothers succeed, with the third succeeding in spirit only. The Sun Spirit remakes and tests the two brothers, who stay in the realm of the sky for many years. They eventually miss their home and return, only to find that many years have passed. With everything they knew either changed or gone, they long to return to the realm of the sky. They return to the sky when they are struck by lightning, as earthly perils could not harm them.

<text>A kachina (; Hopi: &quot;katsina&quot; , plural &quot;katsinim&quot; ) is a spirit being in the religious beliefs of the Pueblo people, Native American cultures located in the south-western part of the United States. In the Pueblo cultures, kachina rites are practiced by the Hopi, Hopi-Tewa and Zuni peoples and certain Keresan tribes, as well as in most Pueblo tribes in New Mexico.

The kachina concept has three different aspects: the supernatural being, the kachina dancers, and kachina dolls (small dolls carved in the likeness of the kachina, that are given only to those who are, or will be responsible for the respectful care and well-being of the doll, such as a mother, wife, or sister).

== Overview ==
Kachinas are spirits or personifications of things in the real world. These spirits are believed to visit the Hopi villages during the first half of the year. The local pantheon of kachinas varies from pueblo community to community. A kachina can represent anything in the natural world or cosmos, from a revered ancestor to an element, a location, a quality, a natural phenomenon, or a concept; there may be kachinas for the sun, stars, thunderstorms, wind, corn, insects, as well as many other concepts.

Kachinas are understood as having human-like relationships: families such as parents and siblings, as well as marrying and having children. Although not worshipped, each is viewed as a powerful being who, if given veneration and respect, can use his particular power for human good, bringing rainfall, healing, fertility, or protection, for example. The central theme of kachina beliefs and practices as explained by is &quot;the presence of life in all objects that fill the universe. Everything has an essence or a life force, and humans must interact with these or fail to survive.&quot;

== Commercialization ==
Beginning around 1900, there was a great deal of interest in the Kachina figurines, especially among tourists, and the dolls became sought-after collectibles. For this reason, many Hopi began making the figurines commercially to make a living. 
==Hopi kachinas==
In many ways the Kachina rites are the most important ceremonial observances in the Hopi religious calendar. Within Hopi religion, the kachinas are said to live on the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, Arizona. To the Hopis, kachinas are supernatural beings who visit the villages to help the Hopis with everyday activities and act as a link between gods and mortals.

According to Susanne and Jake Page, the &quot;katsinam&quot; are &quot;the spirits of all things in the universe, of rocks, stars, animals, plants, and ancestors who have lived good lives.&quot;

The first ceremony of the year, the &quot;Powamu&quot;, occurs in February and is associated with the bean planting, the growing season, and coming of age. The last katsina ceremony, &quot;Niman&quot;, occurs in July and is associated with the harvest, after which the katsinam return to their home in the San Francisco Peaks.

Hopi kachina dolls, &quot;tihü&quot;, are ceremonial objects with religious meaning. Hopi carvers alter these, removing their religious meaning, to meet the demand for decorative commercial objects sought by non-Hopi.

===Wuya===
The most important Hopi kachinas are known as &quot;wuya&quot;. In Hopi, the term &quot;wuya&quot; often refers to the spiritual beings themselves (said to be connected with the Fifth World, Taalawsohu), the dolls, or the people who dress as kachinas for ceremonial dances. These are all understood to embody all aspects of the same belief system. Some of the wuyas include:
* Ahöla
* Ahöl Maana
* Aholi
* Ahul
* Ahulani
* Akush
* Alosaka
* Angak
* Angwushahai-i
* Angwusnasomtaka

* Ursisimu
* We-u-u
* Wiharu
* Wukoqala
* Wupa-ala
* Wupamo
* Wuyak-kuyta

==Zuni kachinas==
Religious ceremonies are central to the Zuni agrarian society. They revolve around the winter and summer solstices, incorporate the importance of weather, especially rain, and ensure successful crops. According to Tanner, &quot;Father Sky and Mother Earth are venerated, as are the welcome kachinas who bring many blessings.&quot;

The Zuni believe that the kachinas live in the Lake of the Dead, a mythical lake which is reached through Listening Spring Lake. This is located at the junction of the Zuni River and the Little Colorado River. Although some archaeological investigations have taken place, they have not been able to clarify which tribe, Zuni or Hopi, developed the Kachina Cult first. Both Zuni and Hopi kachinas are different from each other but have certain similarities and features. In addition, both Zuni and Hopi kachinas are highly featured and detailed, while the kachinas of the Rio Grande Pueblos look primitive in feature. The Hopis have built their cult into a more elaborate rite, and seem to have a greater sense of drama and artistry than the Zunis. On the other hand, the latter have developed a more sizable folklore concerning their kachinas.

According to Clara Lee Tanner, &quot;...&quot;kachina&quot; involves three basic concepts: first, a supernatural being; second, the masked dancer (and the Zuni &quot;is&quot; a kachina when he wears the mask), and third the carved, painted, and dressed doll.&quot; The list of Zuni kachinas includes:

== Ceremonial dancers ==
Many Pueblo Indians, particularly the Hopi and Zuni, have ceremonies in which masked men, called kachinas, play an important role. Masked members of the tribe dress up as kachinas for religious ceremonies that take place many times throughout the year. These ceremonies are social occasions for the village, where friends and relatives are able to come from neighboring towns to see the dance and partake in the feasts that are always prepared. When a Hopi man places a mask upon his head and wears the appropriate costume and body paint, his personal identity is lost and the spirit of the kachina he is supposed to represent takes its place. Besides the male kachinas are many female kachinas called kachin-manas, but women never take the part of male or female kachinas.

The most widely publicised of Hopi kachina rites is the &quot;Snake Dance&quot;, an annual event during which the performers danced while handling live snakes.

=== Clowns ===
Clown personages play dual roles. Their prominent role is to amuse the audience during the extended periods of the outdoor celebrations and Kachina Dances where they perform as jesters or circus clowns. Barry Pritzker stated, regarding the role of clowns in Hopi dances,

The clown&#x27;s more subtle and sacred role is in the Hopis&#x27; ritual performances. The sacred functions of the clowns are relatively private, if not held secret by the Hopi, and as a result have received less public exposure. When observing the preparations taking place in a Kiva of a number of &quot;Pai&#x27;yakyamu&quot; clowns getting ready for their ceremonial performance, Alexander Stephen was told, &quot;We &quot;Koyala&quot; [Koshari] are the fathers of all Kachina.&quot;

The Hopi have four groups of clowns, some of which are sacred. Adding to the difficulty in identifying and classifying these groups, there are a number of kachinas whose actions are identified as clown antics. Barton Wright&#x27;s &quot;Clowns of the Hopi&quot; identifies, classifies, and illustrates the extensive array of clown personages.

== Kachina dolls ==

Kachina dolls are small brightly painted wooden &quot;dolls&quot; which are miniature representations of the masked impersonators. These figurines are given to children not as toys, but as objects to be treasured and studied so that the young Hopis may become familiar with the appearance of the kachinas as part of their religious training. During Kachina ceremonies, each child receives their own doll. The dolls are then taken home and hung up on the walls or from the rafters of the house, so that they can be constantly seen by the children. The purpose of this is to help the children learn to know what the different kachinas look like. It is said that the Hopi recognize over 200 kachinas and many more were invented in the last half of the nineteenth century. Among the Hopi, kachina dolls are traditionally carved by the maternal uncles and given to uninitiated girls at the Bean Dance (Spring Bean Planting Ceremony) and Home Dance Ceremony in the summer. These dolls are very difficult to classify not only because the Hopis have a vague idea about their appearance and function, but also because these ideas differ from mesa to mesa and pueblo to pueblo.

== Origins ==
There are two different accounts in Hopi beliefs for the origins of kachinas. According to one version, the kachinas were good-natured spirit-beings who came with the Hopis from the underworld. The kachinas wandered with the Hopis over the world until they arrived at Casa Grande, where both the Hopis and the kachinas settled. With their powerful ceremonies, the kachinas were of much help and comfort, for example bringing rain for the crops. However, all of the kachinas were killed when the Hopis were attacked and the kachinas&#x27; souls returned to the underworld. Since the sacred paraphernalia of the kachinas were left behind, the Hopis began impersonating the kachinas, wearing their masks and costumes, and imitating their ceremonies in order to bring rain, good crops, and life&#x27;s happiness.

Another account says that the Hopis came to take the kachinas for granted, losing all respect and reverence for them, so the kachinas returned to the underworld. However, before they left, the kachinas taught some of their ceremonies to a few faithful young men and showed them how to make the masks and costumes. When the other Hopi realized their mistake, they remorsefully turned to the kachinas&#x27; human substitutes, and the ceremonies have continued since then.

<text>In Hopi mythology, Aholi is a kachina, a spirit. He is a friend of Eototo and is very handsome; he wears a colorful cloak with a picture of Muyingwa and is the patron kachina of the Pikya clan. Aholi once allowed his throat to be slit so that Eototo could escape. They eventually met again. Aholi, a chief kachina on Third Mesa, appears with Eototo. Both are principal kachinas appearing in the Powamu and other sacred rituals.

<text>In Hopi mythology, Muyingwa is one of the kachinas (alternately spelled Katsinam) responsible for the germination of seeds. Alosaka is another katchina responsible for growth of crops, and possibly an alternate name or alternate aspect of Muyingwa. As with other Katchinas Muyingwa and Alosaka are spirits represented by dolls and performed with masks at ceremonies (also called kachinas). They are said to live in the San Francisco Peaks to the west of the Hopi Reservation.

Alosaka refers to two wooden idols called the Alosaka. These idols or kachinas (or katsinam) were part of a shrine at the village of Awatobi, situated south of Keams Canyon on the eastern edge of the Hopi reservation. Awatobi was destroyed around 1700, however the shrine was used for at least another 200 years by the priests from the second mesa village of Mishungnovi (Mishoninovi). The wooden pair was kept in the shrine, made of boulders and sealed with logs, and then taken out only for ritual purposes. The last time they were seen by non-native peoples was approximately 1890.

<text>In Hopi mythology, Angwusnasomtaka, also known as Tümas, is a kachina (a spirit represented by a masked doll). She is a wuya, one of the chief kachinas and is considered the mother of all the hú and all the kachinas. During the Powamu celebration, she leads the initiation rites for the uninitiated children into the Powamu and Kachina societies. This includes the ritual of whipping them with yucca whips. This is a formal ritual and the whipping kachinas are careful in their actions during the ceremonial whipping. In the ritual, each child takes four strokes from the yucca blade then when the initiatory whipping is over, she raises her skirts and receives the same treatment accorded the children. In English, she is known as Crow Mother.

Her trusted helper is Eototo. Her sons are the black and blue Tüngwups, who lead the initiation rites. Angwusnasomtaka means Man With Crow Wings Tied On, while Tümas, her second name, means Crow Mother.

<text>Harrison County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,483, making it the fifth-least populous county in Ohio.

==History==

Harrison County was formed from parts of Jefferson and Tuscarawas Counties in 1813. The county was named after General William Henry Harrison, the hero of the battle of Tippecanoe in the War of 1812 (and later to become the ninth U.S. president).

==Geography==

On May 16, 2013, the Chicago Tribune Business section reported that the Utica Shale underlying Harrison County shows promise as a tight oil production zone. To produce tight oil in large quantities would require horizontal drilling and fracturing of the shale formation as is being done in North Dakota and Texas.

==Politics==
Although in the period up to World War I Hancock County&#x27;s German heritage caused it to lean Democratic, since that war – when German Americans were driven from the Democratic Party by Woodrow Wilson’s postwar settlement policies and James M. Cox’s refusal to accept German language instruction – the county has been powerfully Republican. Since 1920 no Democratic presidential candidate has obtained an absolute majority of Hancock County&#x27;s vote – although Franklin D. Roosevelt did win narrow pluralities in his 1932 and 1936 landslides – and it was one of just five Ohio counties that voted for Barry Goldwater over Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Although Goldwater won by just sixty-three votes, no Democratic presidential nominee since has cracked three-eighths (37.5%) of the county&#x27;s vote.

<doc id="93114" wikidata="Q152891" url="?curid=93114" title="Hamilton County, Ohio">
<text>Hamilton County is located in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 830,639, making it the third-most populous county in Ohio. The county seat and most populous city is Cincinnati. The county is named for the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.
Hamilton County is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The southern portion of Hamilton County was originally owned and surveyed by John Cleves Symmes, and the region was a part of the Symmes Purchase. The first settlers rafted down the Ohio River in 1788 following the American Revolutionary War. They established the towns of Losantiville (later Cincinnati), North Bend, and Columbia.

Hamilton County was organized in 1790 by order of Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, as the second county in the Northwest Territory. Cincinnati was named as the seat. Residents named the county in honor of Alexander Hamilton, who was the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States and a founder of the Federalist Party. Its original boundaries were those defined for the Symmes purchase contract in 1788: the Ohio River in the South, Great Miami River to the west, the Lesser Miami River to the east, and the Cuyahoga River to the North. Its area then included about one-eighth of Ohio and had about 2,000 inhabitants (not including the remaining Native Americans).

The county was greatly expanded in 1792 to include what is today the lower peninsula of Michigan. Since 1796, other counties were created from Hamilton, reducing the county to its present size. The county was the location of much of the Northwest Indian War before and after its organization.

The United States forcibly removed most of the Shawnee and other Indian peoples to move to locations west of the Mississippi River in the 1820s.

Rapid growth occurred during the 1830s and 1840s as the area attracted many German and Irish immigrants, especially after the Great Famine in Ireland and the revolutions in Germany in 1848.

During the Civil War, Morgan&#x27;s Raid (a Confederate cavalry campaign from Kentucky) passed through the northern part of the county during the summer of 1863.

The Sharonville Engineer Depot was constructed by the United States Army in northern Hamilton County in 1942, and continued to be used by the General Services Administration and then the Defense Logistics Agency after 1949. It is currently mostly redeveloped for industrial purposes.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water.

* Warren County (northeast)
* Clermont County (east)
* Campbell County, Kentucky (southeast)
* Kenton County, Kentucky (south)
* Boone County, Kentucky (southwest)

===Geographic features===
The county lies in a region of gentle hills formed by the slopes of the Ohio River valley and its tributaries. The Great Miami River, the Little Miami River, and the Mill Creek also contribute to this system of hillsides and valleys. No naturally occurring lakes exist, but three
major humanmade lakes are part of the Great Parks of Hamilton County. The largest lake by far is Winton Woods Lake, covering 188 surface acres, followed by Miami Whitewater Lake, covering 85 surface acres, and Sharon Lake, covering 36 surface acres.

The county boundaries include the lowest point in Ohio, in Miami Township, where the Ohio River flows out of Ohio and into Indiana. This is the upper pool elevation behind the Markland Dam, above sea level.

The highest land elevation in Hamilton County is the Rumpke Sanitary Landfill at above sea level in Colerain Township.

===Population===
The county&#x27;s highest population was recorded in the 1970 U.S. Census. Since then, the county has lost population at an average rate of three percent per decade. Although Hamilton County is experiencing a decline in birth rates and has higher death rates in older age groups (cohorts), out-migration of residents is the key factor in population loss. In the last decade, this population loss has been reversed, and it is estimated that both Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati have grown their populations.
The Cincinnati Metropolitan Statistical Area, over the last three decades has seen a 19 percent increase in population. Much of the region&#x27;s growth has been through movement of Cincinnati and Hamilton County residents into neighboring counties.

==Government==
As of 2020, the members of the Hamilton Board of County Commissioners are Denise Driehaus, Stephanie Summerow Dumas, and Alicia Reece.

Since 1963, the Board has employed an administrator to run the day-to-day operations of the county; the current administrator is Jeffrey Aluotto. Other elected officers include Dusty Rhodes (Auditor), Joe Deters (Prosecutor), Charmaine McGuffey (Sheriff), Eric Beck (Engineer), Scott Crowley (Recorder), Jill Schiller (Treasurer), and Lakshmi Sammarco (Coroner).

As of 2021, the elected Common Pleas Court include: Judge Jody Luebbers, Judge Lisa Allen, Judge Jennifer Branch, Judge Wende Cross, Judge Leslie Ghiz, Judge Robert Goering, Judge Tom Heekin, Judge Christian Jenkins, Judge Charles Kubicki, Judge Melba Marsh, Judge Terry Nestor, Judge Robert Ruehlman, Judge Nicole Sanders, Judge Megan Shanahan, Judge Alan Triggs, and Judge Christopher Wagner.

===Politics===
Hamilton County was historically rather conservative for an urban county. It long favored Republican candidates in national elections, but has trended Democratic in recent years. In 2008, Barack Obama was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the county since 1964, and only the second since 1936. The county continued to lean Democratic, voting for Obama again in 2012 and for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. In fact, it was one of the few counties in Ohio to swing toward the Democrats in 2016 even as the state as a whole swung toward the Republicans.

In other state elections, the county also tended to favor Republican candidates. Richard Cordray in his failed 2018 bid was the first Democrat to win the county in a gubernatorial election since Dick Celeste in 1982, and only the second since Michael DiSalle in 1958. In Senate elections, the county also tended to back Republicans, but has been won by Frank Lausche in 1962, John Glenn in all four of his elections and Howard Metzenbaum and Sherrod Brown in two out of three elections for both (1982 and 1988, and 2012 and 2018). In the 2006 Ohio elections, both Ted Strickland and Sherrod Brown lost the county by less than 2,000 votes while winning statewide by 24 and 12 points, respectively.

With the election of Democrat Stephanie Summerow Dumas in 2018 midterm elections, the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners was entirely Democratic for the first time ever. Democrats had previously regained majority control of the Board of Commissioners in 2016 with the election of Denise Driehaus. In 2019, longtime Democratic Commissioner Todd Portune announced his resignation from the Board due to health problems. Portune&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Victoria Parks, was appointed to serve the remainder of his term (through the November 2020 general election). With Parks&#x27; appointment, the Board of Commissioners became for the first time all-female and majority Black. In the November 2020 election, Democrat Alicia Reece was elected to fill Parks&#x27; seat, thereby retaining the Board&#x27;s status as all-female and majority Black.

Historically, due to its tight races and its position in the swing state of Ohio, Hamilton County was regarded as a crucial county to win in presidential elections. In 2012, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named Hamilton as one of the seven most important counties in the country for that year&#x27;s election. &quot;Time&quot; characterized Hamilton County&#x27;s political scene as &quot;a battle between conservative suburbs and a Democratic urban center, though Cincinnati is one of the most conservative metro areas in the Midwest.&quot; Those characterizations became less true in recent years. While many of Cincinnati&#x27;s western suburbs, like Green and Delhi Townships, continue to strongly support Republican candidates, the city itself and most of its northern suburbs vote strongly Democratic.

<doc id="93117" wikidata="Q288592" url="?curid=93117" title="Geauga County, Ohio">
<text>Geauga County ( ) is a county located in the northeast portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 95,397. The county seat and largest city is Chardon.

The county is named for an Onondaga or Seneca language word meaning &#x27;raccoon&#x27;, originally the name of the Grand River. Geauga County is part of the Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2008, Forbes Magazine ranked Geauga County as the fourth best place in the United States to raise a family. About 20% of the counties area (Geauga, Trumbull, Ashtabula and Portage) population is Amish, .

==History==
Geauga County is named after the Onondaga word &quot;jyo’ä·gak&quot; or Seneca &quot;jo’ä·ka&quot;, both meaning &#x27;raccoon&#x27; (originally the name of the Grand River).

After the discovery of the New World, the land that became Geauga County was originally part of the French colony of Canada (New France), which was ceded in 1763 to Great Britain and renamed Province of Quebec. In the late 18th century the land became part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory, and then was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795.

Geauga County was founded on March 1, 1806, as the second county in the Connecticut Western Reserve, originating from Trumbull County, Ohio. In 1808, the size of Geauga County was reduced by the creation of Ashtabula County, Cuyahoga County, and Lake County.

The present-day boundaries were established in 1840 following the creation of Lake County. A disagreement about the location of the county seat began in 1808 when commissioners from Trumbull County began the process of identifying the seat of justice. Residents in the northern townships wanted the seat in Champion, renamed Painesville, Ohio in 1832. Residents in southern townships desired a centrally located county seat and took advantage of a tract of land donated by Peter Chardon Brooks called Chardon, Ohio. Despite Chardon being selected in 1809, the argument was never really settled. Over the next two decades, population growth in the seven northern townships exceeded the remaining sixteen southern townships, further fueling the disagreement. On January 21, 1840, a petition to create Lake County from seven townships in northern Geauga County and Willoughby Township from Cuyahoga County were presented to the Ohio House of Representatives. Seabury Ford presented petitions against its creation. Lake County was established in March 1840 by the Ohio Legislature. As the newly formed Lake County did not have sufficient territory to meet the requirements for a county, the northern border included submerged land beneath the waters of Lake Erie.

The first settlement in Geauga was at Burton, Ohio in the year 1798, when three families settled there from Connecticut.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water.

Geauga County receives the most precipitation of any county in northern Ohio, with most of the county receiving over 42 inches annually in an average year, and some parts exceeding 44 inches.

===Drainage system===
The geography of Geauga County was radically changed by Illinoian and Wisconsinan glaciation, which is evident in the deranged drainage system, landscape change, and glacial till. The headwaters of three watercourses in the Lake Erie basin are in Geauga County. These include the Cuyahoga River, Chagrin River, and Grand River. Portions of all three are designated Ohio Scenic Rivers.

Point sources of the east branch of the Cuyahoga River are in Hambden Township, Claridon Township, and Burton Township. The point source of the west branch of the Cuyahoga River is near the intersection of Pond and Rapids Roads in Burton Township.

The point sources of the east branch of the Chagrin River are at Bass Lake in Munson Township and the southwest corner of the city of Chardon. McFarland Creek in Bainbridge Township, sometimes referred to as Chagrin Falls because of the postal zip code, is a tributary of the Aurora branch of the Chagrin River.

Point sources of the Grand River are in Parkman Township, Troy Township, and Swine Creek in Middlefield Township.

While the majority of waterways in Geauga County are part of the Lake Erie watershed, the Silver Creek in Troy Township is a tributary to the west branch of the Mahoning River, part of the Ohio River watershed, the largest tributary to the Mississippi River. There is another Silver Creek in Geauga County in Russell Township, which is a tributary to the east branch of the Chagrin River.

<text>Gallia County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 29,220. Its county seat and largest village is Gallipolis.

Named after the French people who originally settled there, its name “Gallia” is the Latin word for Gaul, the ancient region of Western Europe that included present day France. Gallia County is part of the Point Pleasant, WV-OH Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Gallia County was formed on March 25, 1803, from portions of Adams and Washington counties. Gallia County had originally been settled by French immigrants, who named the county &quot;Gallia&quot;, the Latin name for Gaul, the ancient region of Western Europe which included present day France.

In the 19th century, the county was settled by numerous migrants from the Upper South, who traveled to the territory by the Ohio River. In the antebellum years, some of its towns became centers of settlement by African Americans, both free blacks (some also from the South) and refugee slaves who had escaped their owners and come across the river to a free state.

In 1818, a group from Wales settled in Gallia County, with Welsh remaining Gallia County&#x27;s most common second language until 1970.

<text>Franklin County is a county in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,323,807, making it the most populous county in Ohio. Most of its land area is taken up by its county seat, Columbus, the state capital and most populous city in Ohio. The county was established on April 30, 1803, less than two months after Ohio became a state, and was named after Benjamin Franklin. Originally, Franklin County extended north to Lake Erie before it was subdivided into smaller counties. Franklin County is the central county of the Columbus, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Franklin County, particularly Columbus, has been a centerpiece for presidential and congressional politics, most notably the 2000 presidential election, the 2004 presidential election, and the 2006 midterm elections. Franklin County is home to one of the largest universities in the United States, Ohio State University, which has about 60,000 students on its main Columbus campus.

It shares a name with Franklin County in Kentucky, where Frankfort is located. This makes it one of two pairs of capital cities in counties of the same name, along with Marion Counties in Indiana and Oregon.

==History==

On March 30, 1803, the Ohio government authorized the creation of Franklin County. The county originally was part of Ross County. Residents named the county in honor of Benjamin Franklin. In 1816, Franklin County&#x27;s Columbus became Ohio&#x27;s state capital. Surveyors laid out the city in 1812, and officials incorporated it in 1816. Columbus was not Ohio&#x27;s original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after its location for a short time at Chillicothe and at Zanesville. Columbus was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access by way of major transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio&#x27;s capital over a number of other competitors, including Franklinton, Dublin, Worthington, and Delaware.

On May 5, 1802, a group of prospective settlers founded the Scioto Company at the home of Rev. Eber B. Clark in Granby, Connecticut, for the purpose of forming a settlement between the Muskingum River and Great Miami River in the Ohio Country. James Kilbourne was elected president and Josiah Topping secretary. On August 30, 1802, James Kilbourne and Nathaniel Little arrived at Colonel Thomas Worthington&#x27;s home in Chillicothe. They tentatively reserved land along the Scioto River on the Pickaway Plains for their new settlement.

On October 5, 1802, the Scioto Company met again in Granby and decided not to purchase the lands along the Scioto River on the Pickaway Plains, but rather to buy land farther north from Jonas Stanbery and his partner, an American Revolutionary War general, Jonathan Dayton. were purchased along the Whetstone River (now known as the Olentangy River) at $1.50 per acre. This land was part of the United States Military District surveyed by Israel Ludlow in 1797 and divided into townships square.

Before the state legislature&#x27;s decision in 1812, Columbus did not exist. The city was originally designed as the state&#x27;s new capital, preparing itself for its role in Ohio&#x27;s political, economic, and social life. In the years between the first ground-breaking and the actual movement of the capital in 1816, Columbus and Franklin County grew significantly. By 1813, workers had built a penitentiary, and by the following year, residents had established the first church, school, and newspaper in Columbus. Workers completed the Ohio Statehouse in 1861. Columbus and Franklin County grew quickly in population, with the city having 700 people by 1815. Columbus officially became the county seat in 1824. By 1834, the population of Columbus was 4,000 people, officially elevating it to &quot;city&quot; status.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water. The county is located in the Till Plains and the Appalachian Plateau land regions.

The county is drained by the Olentangy River and the Scioto River. Major creeks in the county include Big Darby Creek, Big Walnut Creek, and Alum Creek. There are two large reservoirs in the county, Hoover Reservoir and Griggs Reservoir.

==Politics==
For most of the 20th century, Franklin County shared the heavy Republican bent of the rest of central Ohio, and was one of the more conservative urban counties in the nation. From 1896 to 1992, it went Republican all but five times, the last three of which were national Democratic landslides that saw the Democratic candidate win over 400 electoral votes. However, it has gone Democratic in every election since 1996, reflecting the Democratic trend in most other urban counties nationwide. Columbus and most of its northern and western suburbs lean Democratic, while the more blue-collar southern section of the county leans Republican. From 1996 to 2004, Democratic nominees carried the county by single digit margins, but it swung significantly in favor of Barack Obama in 2008. The county swung towards Democrats in every subsequent presidential election until 2024, when Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won the county with 63.0 percent of the vote and a 28.1 percent margin of victory.

In Congress, it is split between two districts. Most of Columbus itself is in the 3rd district, represented by Democrat Joyce Beatty. The southwestern portion is in 15th district, represented by Republican Mike Carey.

<text>Fairfield County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 158,921. Its county seat and largest city is Lancaster. Its name is a reference to the Fairfield area of the original Lancaster. Fairfield County is part of the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Fairfield County originally encompassed all or parts of Knox, Hocking, Licking, Perry, and Pickaway Counties. Fairfield is a descriptive name referring to the beauty of their fields.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.8%) is water.

Fairfield County sits just on the edge of Ohio&#x27;s Appalachian region. While the once-glaciated northern portion of the county is fairly flat, as one travels south along U.S. 33 one can easily recognize the foothills of a mountainous region beginning around the village of Carroll. Although not officially part of the state or federal definition of Appalachia, certain areas of Fairfield County—particularly those south of U.S. 22—bear a distinctly Appalachian feel in both physical geography and demographics.

The scenic Hocking Hills region lies immediately to the south, mostly in neighboring Hocking County. A large portion of Buckeye Lake is located in northeastern Fairfield County.

Mudhouse Mansion, an allegedly haunted house, was located in the county.

The area including Delaware County was once home to numerous Native American tribes. In 1804, Colonel Moses Byxbe and Henry Baldwin, among others, migrated to central Ohio from Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and built a town on the west bank of the Olentangy River. On February 10, 1808, the Ohio government authorized the creation of Delaware County. Following the War of 1812, settlers began to arrive in the county and settled down in Delaware. The town was incorporated in 1816, being the first incorporated town in the county. Powell, originally named Middlebury, was founded in 1801, but was not incorporated until 1947. Sunbury was founded in 1816. Ohio Wesleyan University, a liberal arts college, was founded by Methodists in 1842.

Delaware County had Northern sympathies during the Civil War, and abolitionists brought the Underground Railroad through the area. A local road, Africa Road, derives its name from the era. Camp Delaware was one of the few Civil War camps that deployed African American soldiers. The Civil War played an important part in Delaware County&#x27;s growth, bringing railroad business and technology. By 1900, Delaware had its first electric streetway, and an electric interurban railroad connecting Marion and Columbus ran through the county. The Little Brown Jug race was founded in 1946, and is one of the races in the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers.

In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Delaware County as the fifth best place in the United States to raise a family and the second best in Ohio, behind Geauga County. In 2020, Delaware was rated the best county to live in Ohio and 24th in the United States by Niche, 17th healthiest county by US News, and 24th best counties to live in by 247WallSt.

==Politics==
Delaware County is considered a Republican stronghold, and has been for most of the party&#x27;s history. The only Democratic presidential candidate to win the county from 1856 to the present day was Woodrow Wilson in his 1912 and 1916 electoral victories. 

However, in 2020, Joe Biden came within single digits of flipping the county, the closest result since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory in 1964. The growth of suburban Columbus, which has been growing increasingly Democratic in recent years, is one of the factors driving Delaware County away from its former overwhelming Republican support. In 2024, Kamala Harris won 46% of the vote in the county, the highest percentage for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1964, despite losing both Ohio and the presidential election.

In August 2023, the county voted against Ohio Issue 1, which would have changed the threshold required to modify the Ohio Constitution, by a margin of 57.72-42.28. In November 2023, the county voted for Issue 1, which amended the state constitution to guarantee a woman&#x27;s reproductive rights, by a margin of 59.21%-40.79%.

<doc id="93127" wikidata="Q5278771" url="?curid=93127" title="Diné Bahaneʼ">
<text> (, ), is a Navajo creation story that describes the prehistoric emergence of the Navajo as a part of the Navajo religious beliefs. It centers on the area known as the Dinétah, the traditional homeland of the Navajo, and forms the basis of the traditional Navajo way of life and ceremony. Throughout the stories the importance of cardinal points and the number four are emphasized in multiple aspects.

The basic outline of begins with the creation of the (, ‘Holy Wind’) as the mists of lights which arose through the darkness to animate and bring purpose to the spirits of the four ([tɪ̀jɪ̀n tɪ̀nèʔé], ‘Holy People’) in the different three lower worlds. According to the story, this event happened before the Earth and the physical aspect of humans had come into being, when only the spiritual aspect of humans existed. The Holy People then began journeying through the different lower worlds, learning important lessons in each one before moving on to the next. The fourth and final world is the world in which the Navajo live now.

== The four Worlds ==
The Diné Bahane’ has detailed descriptions of characteristics and events of the four mythical worlds. The First or Dark World, () was small and centered on an island floating in the middle of four seas. The inhabitants of the first world were the four , the two Coyotes, the four rulers of the four seas, mist beings, and various insect and bat people, the latter being the Air-Spirit People. The supernatural beings First Woman and First Man came into existence here and met for the first time after seeing each other&#x27;s fire. The various beings on The First World started fighting with one another and thus had to depart by flying out through an opening in the east.

The Second World ([nɪ̀ʔ xòtòːtɬʼɪ̀ʒ]) was inhabited by various blue-gray furred mammals and various birds, including blue swallows. The beings from the First World offended Swallow Chief, ([txɑ́ʃtʃʰóʒìː]), and they were asked to depart. To do so, the First Man created a wand of jet and other materials to allow the people to walk upon it up into the next world through an opening in the south.

In the Third or Yellow World ([nɪ̀ʔ xɑ̀ɬtsʰòːɪ́]), there were two rivers that formed a cross, the Sacred Mountains, and more animal people, but there was still no sun. This time it was not discord among the people that drove them away but a great flood caused by ([txéːxòːɬtsʰótì]) when Coyote stole her two children.

When the people arrived in the Fourth or White World ([nɪ̀ʔ xòtɪ̀sxõ̀s]), there were anaye () living there. The Sacred Mountains were re-formed from soil taken from the original mountains in the Second World. First Man and the Holy People created the sun, moon, seasons, and stars. It was here that true death came into existence when Coyote tossed a stone into a lake, declaring that if it sank then the dead would go back to the previous world.

The first human born in the Fourth World is ([jòːɬkɑ̀ì ɑ̀stsɑ̃́ː]), who matures into [ɑ̀stsɑ̃́ː nɑ́tɬèːxé] and, in turn, gives birth to the Hero Twins called and . The twins have many adventures in which they help to rid the world of various monsters. Multiple batches of modern humans were created a number of times in the Fourth World, and the gave them ceremonies which are still practiced today.

== Main events and creations ==

=== The First World or ===
Of a time long ago these things are said. The first world was small, and black as soot. In the middle of the four seas there was an island floating in the mist. On the island grew a pine tree.

Dark ants dwelt there. Red ants dwelled there. Dragonflies dwelled there. Yellow beetles dwelled there. Hard beetles dwelled there. Stone-carrier beetles dwelled there. Black beetles dwelled there. Coyote-dung beetles dwelled there. Bats dwelled there. White-faced beetles dwelled there. Locusts dwelled there. White locusts dwelled there.

These were the twelve groups of the , the Air-Spirit People, who lived in the First World.

Around the floating island were four seas. Each sea was ruled by a being. In the sea to the East dwelled , Big Water Creature, The One Who Grabs Things in the Water. In the sea to the south lived , Blue Heron. In the sea to the west dwelled , Frog. In the ocean to the north dwelled , Winter Thunder.

Above each sea appeared a cloud. There was a black cloud, a white cloud, a blue cloud, and a yellow cloud. The Black Cloud contained the Female spirit of Life. The White Cloud contained the Male spirit of Dawn.

The Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud came together in the West, and a wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Woman, , was formed, and with her the yellow corn, perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. White shell, and turquoise, and yucca were there with her.

The Black Cloud and the White Cloud came together in the East, and the wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Man, , was formed and with him the white corn, , perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. Crystal, symbol of the mind and clear seeing, was with him.

First Woman made a fire with her turquoise. First Man made a fire with his crystal. Its light was the mind&#x27;s first awakening. They saw each other&#x27;s light in the distance.

When the Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud rose high in the sky, First Woman saw the light of First Man&#x27;s fire, and she went out to find it. Three times she was unsuccessful. The fourth time she found the home of First Man. &quot;I wondered what this thing could be,&quot; she said. &quot;I saw you walking and wondered why you did not come,&quot; First Man said. &quot;Why do you not come with your fire, and we will live together.&quot; First Woman agreed to this. So instead of the man going to the woman, as is the custom now, the woman went to live with the man.

Another person, [mɑ̃̀ʔìːtxòʔɪ́ ɑ́ɬtʃʰɪ́nɪ́], Great Coyote, was formed in the water. He told First Man and First Woman that he had been hatched from an egg, and knew all that was under the water and all that was in the skies. First Man believed him. Then a second coyote, , First Angry, appeared. He said to the three, &quot;You believe that you were the first persons. You are mistaken. I was living when you were formed.&quot; First Angry brought witchcraft into the world.

The Air-Spirit People became jealous of one another and began to fight. The rulers of the four seas, Blue Heron, Frog, White Thunder, and Big Water Creature could stand it no more, and told the beings of the island that they must all leave this world. Some climbed and some flew until they came to an opening in the sky. They crawled through it and into the Second World.

=== The Second World or ===
First Woman, First Man, the Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water, and the Coyote First Angry, followed by all the others, climbed up from the Dark World to the Second or Blue World.

After arriving to the second world, the insect people sent scouts, which were plain locusts, to see if they could find anyone in the area. The scouts were first sent to the east and after two days, they returned and had not found anyone or anything yet. The scouts were then sent south to explore and they were once again not able to find anyone or anything. The scouts were sent on two more trips and after they had returned from their fourth trip, the camp of the Air Spirit people was visited by the Swallow people.

They found a number of people already living there: bluebirds, blue hawks, bluejays, blue herons, and all the blue furred beings. The powerful swallow people lived there also. They lived in blue houses, scattered across a broad, blue plain. The houses were cone-shaped and they were tapered towards the top. The swallow people said to the Air-Spirit People, &quot;You are welcome here among us.&quot; The Swallow people and Air-Spirit people then treated each other like they were all members of a single tribe, and for twenty-three days they all lived together in harmony. But on the night of the twenty-fourth day one of the Air-Spirit People approached the wife of the swallow chief and wished to sleep with her.

The next morning after finding out what happened the previous night, the Swallow Chief, , said to the newcomers, &quot;We welcomed you here among us. We treated you as kin. Yet this is how you return our kindness. Now you must leave this world.&quot; After the Chief told the Air-Spirit people that they must leave, he said “Anyhow, this is a bad land. There is not enough food for all of us. People are dying here every day from hunger. Even if we allowed you to stay, you could not live here very long.&quot; While in the second world, the Air-Spirit people still had not changed their way of life and they were not yet living in balance and harmony.

The Air-Spirit people wandered upward looking for a way into the next world. , The Wind, called to them from the South. They followed him and found a slit in the sky that was upward slanted. The sky had a hard shell like the world they had previously been to. First Man created a wand of jet and other materials and the Air-Spirit people flew or walked upon it up into the next world. One by one they passed through to the other side.

=== The Third World or ===
The bluebird had joined the Air-Spirit People and was the first to reach the Third or Yellow World. After him came the First Four and all the others.

The great Female River crossed this land from north to south. The great Male River crossed the land from east to west. The rivers flowed through one another in the middle, and the name of this place is , Crossing of the Waters.

In the Yellow World were six mountains. In the East was [sɪ̀snɑ̀ːtʃɪ̀nɪ́] Dawn, or White Shell Mountain. In the South was [tsʰòːtsɪ́ɬ] Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. To the West was [tòːkʼòʔóːsɬít] Abalone Shell Mountain. In the North was [tɪ̀pé nɪ̀tsʰɑ̀ː] Big Sheep Mountain. Near the Center of the Yellow World was , Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. And near it, East of center, there was , Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain.

Holy People lived on the mountains. They were immortal, and could travel by following the path of the rainbow and the rays of the sun. One was , Talking God. His body was white. One was , Water Sprinkler. He was blue. One was , House God. His body was yellow. One was , Black God, the god of fire. Beyond them to the east lived Turquoise Boy, who was a , neither male nor female, who guarded the great male reed. And far to the West, on Abalone Shell Mountain, lived White Shell Girl, also a . With her was the big female reed, which grew at the water&#x27;s edge with no tassel. 

In the autumn, the four Holy People called to First Man and First Woman, and visited them, but they did not speak. Four days in a row they visited. On the fourth day, Black God said, &quot;You must cleanse yourselves and we will return in twelve days.&quot;

First Man and First Woman bathed carefully and dried themselves with corn meal. They listened and waited. On the twelfth day the four Holy People returned. Water Sprinkler and Black God carried a sacred buckskin. Talking God carried two perfect ears of corn, with their points completely covered with kernels. One ear of corn was white, the male corn belonging to First Man. The other ear was yellow, the female corn belonging to First Woman. The gods placed one buckskin on the ground facing west, and on it they placed the two ears of corn with their tips pointing east. Under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle. Under the yellow ear of corn they put the feather of a yellow eagle. They told the people to stand at a distance so that the wind could enter.

The White Wind, blew between the buckskins, and while the wind blew, each of the Holy People walked four times around them, and the feathers were seen to move. In this way, they transformed First Man and First Woman from spirit people into human beings, with great powers. &quot;Now,&quot; the Holy People said, &quot;live here as husband and wife.&quot;

At the end of four days First Woman gave birth to twins. They were neither male nor female, but . Four days later a second set of twins was born, one male and one female. After twenty days a total of five pairs of twins had been born, half of them male and half of them female. Almost at once they were full grown. The Holy People took each set of twins to their home on the East Mountain and taught them how to wear masks and pray, and then returned them to their parents. Eight winters passed, and during that time the twins found mates with the Mirage People. Many people came into being.

==== Spider-Woman, Spider-Man and Weaving ====
Near , Crossing of the Waters, lived Spider Woman and Spider Man. They knew how to weave the fibers of cotton and hemp and other plants. First Woman asked Spider Woman and Spider Man to teach people how to weave the fibers of plants so they would not have to depend on animal skins for clothing. Cotton seeds were planted, and the cotton was gathered. Spider Man taught the people to shape a little wheel, 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and put a slender stick through it to spin the cotton. First Woman said, &quot;You must spin towards your person, not away, as you wish to have the beautiful goods come to you. If you spin away from you, the goods will depart from you.&quot; Spider Man named the spindle &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;turning around with the beautiful goods.&quot; Spider Woman said, &quot;No, it shall be called , turning around with the mixed chips.&quot;

After they had spun the thread they rolled it into good-sized balls, and brought straight poles and tied them to make a rectangular frame. Spider Man wound the thread on two of the poles from east to west, over and under the poles. Then Spider Man said that the ball of thread should be called &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;rolling with the beautiful goods.&quot; Spider Woman said, &quot;No, it shall be called , rolling with the mixed chips.&quot;

After the loom was finished the cross poles were erected and other poles placed on the ground to hold the loom frame solidly, and the loom was stretched into place. Spider Man said, &quot;It shall be called , raising with the beautiful goods.&quot; Spider Woman said, &quot;No, it shall be called , raising with the mixed chips.&quot;

There was a notched stick running across, with a notch holding every other thread. Spider Man said, &quot;It will be called , looping with the beautiful goods.&quot; Spider Woman said, &quot;No, it shall be called , looping with the mixed chips.&quot; Then they used a narrow stick about two and a half feet long, and wound the yarn or thread over it, and where there is no design they ran it along. That was given the same name as the ball of thread. They used the wide flat stick for tapping down the thread. Spider Man said, &quot;It shall be called ;&quot; but Spider Woman said, &quot;It shall be called .&quot;

Spider Man then said, &quot;Now you know all that I have named for you. It is yours to work with and to use following your own wishes. But from now on when a baby girl is born to your tribe you shall go and find a spider web woven at the mouth of some hole; you must take it and rub it on the baby&#x27;s hand and arm. Thus, when she grows up she will weave, and her fingers and arms will not tire from the weaving.&quot;

==== The Separation of Women and Men ====
One day, First Man brought home a fine deer that he had killed. First Woman said, &quot;I thank my vagina for this deer.&quot; First Man demanded to know what she meant. &quot;I mean that you bring me food because you wish to have sex with me,&quot; she said. &quot;But we women could live happily without men. We are the ones who gather the food and till the fields. We have no need of men.&quot; First Man grew angry and called all the men together. &quot;The women think they can live without us,&quot; he told them. &quot;Let us see if that is true.&quot;

The men and the two hermaphrodite twins crossed the river to the north bank carrying the grinding stones and bowls and baskets that the hermaphrodite twins had made, and the axes and hoes that the men had invented. The women bared themselves along the bank of the river and called out to the men, saying &quot;See what you are missing?&quot;
There were occasionally men and women who so longed after the other that some jumped into the river that separated them in a vain attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Unfortunately the currents of the river were too strong and the swimmers were washed down the river, never to be seen again.

For four years the women and the men lived apart. During this time the food that the women harvested became less, because they had no tools, while the men grew more and more food. But each group longed for the other. The women sought to satisfy themselves with bones and feathers and long stones. The men tried to relieve their longing with the fresh meat of animals. One man, , tried to satisfy himself using the liver of a deer. Owl called out to him to stop. &quot;This is wrong,&quot; Owl said. &quot;No good can come of this separation. You must bring the men and the women together again.&quot; As it turns out Owl was right. From the women who had sought to satisfy themselves with foreign objects, monsters were born out of this. The monsters would go on to terrorize the people wherever they roamed.

 spoke to the other men. Finally they all spoke to First Man. First Man called across the river to First Woman, and asked, &quot;Do you still think you can live alone?&quot; &quot;I no longer believe I can,&quot; she responded. &quot;I am sorry I let the things you said make me angry,&quot; First Man said. And then the men sent a raft to the women&#x27;s side of the river to bring the women across. The men and women bathed and dried their bodies with corn meal, and remained apart until nightfall. Then they would resume their lives together.

==== Big Water Creature and the Great Flood ====
But a mother and her two daughters had been in the fields and had not seen the raft. Now it was dark, and they saw that all of the women had crossed the river to the men&#x27;s side. They began to swim across. But , Big Water Creature, grabbed the two daughters and dragged them to her home under the water. For three days and three nights, the people searched the river for the girls, but they could not find them.

On the morning of the fourth day, Talking God and Water Sprinkler appeared with a large bowl of white shell and a large bowl of blue shell. The people gathered around them. They placed the bowls at the water&#x27;s edge, and started to spin them. The spinning bowls created an opening in the water which led downward to a large house with four rooms. First Man and First Woman traveled down the passage and into the house, and behind them crept the Coyote named First Angry. In the north room of the house, they found Big Water Creature asleep in a chair. Her own two children were there, and also the two missing daughters. First Man and First Woman took the hands of the girls and led them back through the passage and on to the bank. Behind them, Coyote carried the two children of Big Water Creature, wrapped in his big skin coat with white fur lining. There was great celebrating because the lost girls were returned.

The next morning, animals began running past the village from the east. Deer ran by, and turkeys, and antelopes, and squirrels. For three days, animals ran past, fleeing from something. On the morning of the fourth day, the people sent locusts flying to the east to find out what was happening. The locusts returned and told that a great wall of water was coming from the east, and a tide of water from the north and from the south. The people ran to the top of the mountain . First Man ran to each of the other Sacred Mountains, took dirt from each, and summoned the Holy People, and returned to . Turquoise Boy came bearing the great Male Reed, and First Man planted it in the top of the mountain. All the people began to blow on the reed, and it began to grow and grow until it reached the canopy of the sky. Woodpecker hollowed out a passage inside the reed, and the people and Turquoise Boy and the four Holy People all began to climb up until they came out in the Fourth World.

=== The Fourth World or ===
After the people had all emerged into the Fourth, or White World, they saw the water continuing to rise in the Third World beneath them. Big Water Creature pushed her head through the opening in the reed. Her curly hair floated on the water, and lightning flashed from her black horn and her yellow horn. First Man asked Big Water Creature why she had come. She said nothing. But the Coyote named First Angry came forward wearing his skin coat. He said &quot;Perhaps it is because of this,&quot; and drew the two babies from under his coat. Turquoise Boy took a basket and filled it with turquoise. On top of the turquoise he placed the blue pollen from blue flowers and yellow pollen from the corn, and pollen from water flags, and on top of these he placed the crystal, which is river pollen. This basket he gave to Coyote, who put it between the horns of the Big Water Creature, and on the basket he placed the two children. The Big Water Creature disappeared down into the reed, and the water with her.

They saw that they were on an island in the middle of a bubbling lake, surrounded by high cliffs. At first the people could not find a way to get across the water to the shore. They called on Water Sprinkler to help them. He had brought four great stones with him from the Third World. He threw one to the east. When it hit the cliff wall, it broke a hole through it, and water began to flow out of the lake. He threw a stone to the south. He threw one to the west. And to the north he threw one. Each stone created a hole in the cliff, and the water of the lake became lower. A lane now connected the island to the shore to the east, but it was deep with mud. The people called on , Smooth Wind, to help them. He blew steadily for a long time, and finally the people were able to leave the island.

First Man and First Woman built a hogan to live in. It was not like a hogan of today. First Man dug a shallow pit in the earth and placed poles in it. For the main poles he used two parts of the Black Bow, . One pole he cut from the Male Reed. One pole he cut from the Female Reed. The structure was covered with earth and grass. First Woman ground white corn and they powdered the poles and sprinkled corn meal inside the dwelling from East to West. First Man said, &quot;May my home be sacred and beautiful, and may the days be beautiful and plenty.&quot; This was the first hogan-raising ceremony.

==== Creation of Sun and Moon ====
Inside, First Man lay with his head to the East, and First Woman lay with her head to the West. Their thoughts mingled, and those thoughts were sacred. They began to plan for the time that was to come, and how people would live on the earth. Great Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water came in to help them plan. Together, they planned that there should be a sun, a moon, and day and night. They decided to keep the other Coyote, First Angry, away from their planning, because it was he who had brought unhappiness.

First Man, First Woman, and Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water covered the floor of the hogan with a perfect buckskin. On the buckskin the placed a perfect round turquoise, larger than the height of a man. Below the turquoise they placed a great perfect white shell. At that moment the Coyote , First Angry, came and asked them what they were doing. &quot;Nothing,&quot; they said. &quot;So I see,&quot; he said. And he went away.

First Man went looking for , The Black Yéʼii, known as the Fire God. First Man found him in a place where there was fire under the earth, and called to him. He returned to the first hogan with First Man. First Man and First Woman also summoned the other three Holy People, Water Sprinkler, House God, and Talking God. Together, they told Turquoise Boy and White Shell Girl that they were creating the sun and the moon. They asked Turquoise Boy if he would become the sun, and they asked White Shell Girl if she would become the moon. Again, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked them what they were doing. &quot;Nothing,&quot; they said. &quot;So I see,&quot; he said, and he went away.

First Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People planned that there would be 12 months. With each month, the moon would pass from dark to light, and the sun would move to a different path in the sky. White Shell Girl was given a whistle made from the Female Reed, with 12 holes in it. Each time she completed her cycle she would blow on the whistle, and a new month would begin. The first month was named , Back-to-Back, or Parting of the Seasons. Today it is called October. The second month was named , Time of Slender Winds. The third month was , Great Wind. It is the time to begin to tell the sacred stories. The fourth month, January, was , Crusted Snow. This is the month of many ceremonies, and the time for sacred stories. February, the fifth month, is , Baby Eagle. After this month, sacred stories must not be told to the young people. The sixth month, , is the month of Sudden Spring Storms. Ceremonies are held to bless the fields before seeds are planted. The seventh month was , Little Leaves. May, , was the eighth month. Finally they planned , When-Few-Seeds-Ripen, , Great Seed Ripening, , Little Ripening, and finally September, , Harvest Time, when foods are stored for the winter.

Again, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked what they were doing. &quot;Nothing,&quot; they said. &quot;So I see,&quot; he said, and he went away.

Fire God, the Black Yéʼii, used his fire to heat the turquoise on the buckskin until it became red hot. Then they asked Turquoise Boy to enter the glowing turquoise. &quot;If I do that, I must be paid with the lives of the people of the earth, all the human beings, the animals which have four legs, the birds and insects of the air, the fishes and all the people under the water.&quot; And then the White Shell Girl repeated the same thing. First Woman, First Man, Great Coyote, and the Holy People all agreed. Then Turquoise Boy entered the glowing Turquoise. First Man used his crystal to heat the White Shell, and White Shell Girl entered the White Shell. Four circles were made around the inside of the hogan to complete the ceremony. In this way, Turquoise Boy became the sun, , The One Who Rules the Day. And White Shell Girl became the moon, , The One Who Rules the Night. , the East Wind, asked to carry the newly formed sun to his land so that it could begin its journey there.

The Coyote named First Angry appeared again. He said, &quot;I know you have been planning great things. I demand to know why I was not included in the planning.&quot; First Man and First Woman said nothing. Coyote said, &quot;You believe that I spoiled your living in the lower worlds, but it is not true. Now I will spoil your plans. The path of the sun and the path of the moon will not return to their beginning after 12 months. The twelve months of the sun will be 13 months of the moon. Sometimes frost will come early, and sometimes it will remain late. Sometimes the rains will not come, and you will have to summon the baby of the Big Water Creature to bring water.&quot; And he left them.

==== The Coming of Death ====
Late in the first day, when was finishing his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. Afraid, the people left her alone. In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but was gone. One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw sitting by the side of the river combing her hair. He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. The people asked Coyote what to do. He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all angry with Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. &quot;I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink.&quot; The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. &quot;Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for.&quot; The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote&#x27;s rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.

==== Stars and Constellations ====
First Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People next planned stars for the night sky. They gathered as many pieces of , &quot;rock-star mica,&quot; as they could find, and put them on a blanket. Then First Man made a drawing in the dirt to plan the location of all the stars seeking to make the sky like a woven rug, orderly and balanced. , Black Yéʼii, placed the (North Star). First Man placed the (Big Dipper) while First Woman put the (Little Dipper) into the sky. First Man also placed the (Seven Stars, the Pleiades) which Black Yéʼii claimed represented parts of his body. They placed , the Big First One. They placed , Coyote&#x27;s Feather, or the Slender One (the belt and sword of Orion). They placed , the children of and ; and , The-Old-Man-with Feet Apart; and the Rabbit Tracks, ; and Moving-toward-the-Dawn; and , The-Revolving-Male-Warrior-with-His-Bow-and-Arrow; and his wife, , Who-Carries-the-Fire-in-Her-Basket. The Coyote named First Angry returned to see what was going on. He took a piece of rock-star mica and placed it on the sky, and it became , known by Bilagáana as Canopus. He placed another piece in the south, , Morning Star. Then Coyote said, &quot;This is too long. I have a better way.&quot; He then snapped the blanket and the rest of the rock-star mica was scattered across the sky.

==== The Re-Creation of the Sacred Mountains ====
, First Man, and , First Woman, together with , Water Sprinkler, and , Black Yéʼii, the god of fire, set out to create the six sacred mountains from dirt that First Man had brought up from each mountain in the third world. They placed them as they had been in the third world. They re-created , Dawn, or White Shell Mountain, in the East. They decorated it with white shells. They decorated it with white lightning. They decorated it with white corn. They decorated it with dark clouds that make male rain. From stones they had brought they fashioned , Rock Crystal Boy, and Tséghádiʼnídíinii atʼééd, Rock Crystal Girl, to reside there forever.

In the South they re-created , Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. They adorned it with turquoise. They adorned it with dark mist. They adorned it with animals. They adorned it with light clouds that bring female rain. From two stones they had brought with them they fashioned , the Boy Who Is Bringing Back Turquoise, and , the Girl Who Is Bringing Back Many Ears of Corn. They were created to reside there forever.

To the West they re-created , Abalone Shell Mountain. They adorned it with haliotis shell. They adorned it with animals. They adorned it with dark clouds that bring the male rain. From material from the Third World they created , the White Corn Boy, and , the Yellow Corn Girl. They were created to reside there forever.

In the North they re-created , Big Mountain Sheep. They adorned that mountain with black beads. They adorned it with many plants. They adorned it with many animals. They adorned it with the grey mist that brings female rain. From materials from below, they fashioned , Pollen Boy, and , Grasshopper Girl. They were created to reside there forever.

Near the Center they re-created , Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. They left its summit bare, but they created two beings to reside there. They were , Boy Who Produces Goods, and , Girl Who Produces Goods.

East of center they re-created , Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain. They decorated it with pollen and the clouds that bring female rain. On it they created two beings, , the Boy Who Produces Jewels, and , the Girl Who Produces Jewels, to live there forever.

When all was done, First Man, First Woman, Black Yéʼii and Water Sprinkler returned and taught the people about the sacred mountains. They taught them that these six mountains were their principal mountains. From the lower mesa lands they could see them. Chants were made for them. Finally, a smoke was prepared for the mountains and the chants were sung.

=== The Coming of Monsters ===
In the Third World, there was a time when men and women had lived apart for a long time. During that time, some women had used animal horns or long stones or bird feathers for sex. Now, in the Fourth World, some of those women were pregnant. One woman who had used an antelope horn gave birth to a child with no head. The people held a council and decided that this baby would be abandoned. It was left to die in a gully. But it lived and grew to become , the Horned Monster.

A woman who had used an eagle&#x27;s feather for sex gave birth to a round, headless child with feathered shoulders. A council was held, and it was decided that this baby too should be abandoned. It was left in an alkali pit. But it lived, and grew to become , Monster Eagle. It made its home on &quot;,&quot; a peak beyond La Plata Mountains.

A woman who had used an elongated stone for sex gave birth to a headless child with hard skin and a pointed neck. The people met in council and decided that this baby should be abandoned in a fissure in a cliff. They placed the child and closed the fissure with rocks. But the child lived and grew to become , The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff. It made its home at a place called &quot;Knol ghi nee,&quot; beyond the Carrizos Mountains.

A woman who had skinned a sour cactus and used it for sex gave birth to twins, headless creatures with no limbs. They had two depressions at the top that looked like eyes. The people gathered and decided that these infants had to be abandoned. They threw them as far as they could. But the twins found shelter in brush and survived. They grew to become , the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes.

One monster came about in a different way. A woman named Loose Running Woman went off alone in the direction of the sunrise. After defecating, she used a smooth pebble from the river to clean herself. She placed the warm stone in her genitals just as , the Sun, rose above the horizon. Seeing this, the Sun sent a ray into her. In only nine days she gave birth to a large child. Having no husband, and not knowing who the father of the child was, she abandoned the child in a rocky place. But knew that the baby was his, and he protected it from afar but never visited it. The child grew to be large and powerful and very angry. It was called , Big Giant, by the people.

The monsters hid along paths, and killed and devoured travelers. They killed many people, and the people began to live in fear.

==== The Monster Slayer Twins ====
Most of the people had been killed. First Man said, &quot;Perhaps the Holy People will help us.&quot; In the morning, he saw a dark cloud covering the top of , the Great Spruce Mountain. In the night he saw a fire on the mountain. He said to First Woman, &quot;Someone is there. I must go to them.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;There are many monsters between here and there. It is not safe for you.&quot; The following day the dark cloud remained on the mountain, and at night the fire appeared a second time. This happened the third day as well. On the fourth day, First Man said, &quot;I must go. I believe there is a Holy Person on the mountain who can help us.&quot; He set out for . As he walked, he sang: I am , and I head for in pursuit of old age and happiness. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the lightning and approach the place where it strikes. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the rainbow and approach the place where it touches the earth. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the dark cloud&#x27;s trail and approach the place where it is thickest. In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the scent of the rain, and approach the place where the lines of rain are darkest.

At the very summit of , he heard the cry of an infant and the crash of lightning, the pouring of rain, and he saw the tip of a rainbow with intense colors in front of the black sky. Suddenly the rain stopped and the sky became light. Where he had heard the cry of a baby there was a turquoise figure of a girl lying on the ground. First Man picked up the turquoise girl and carried it home with him.

==== The Birth of Changing Woman ====
Two days later First Man and First Woman were awakened very early in the morning by the sound &quot;Wu&#x27;hu&#x27;hu&#x27;hu&#x27;.&quot; They knew it was , Talking God. He told them they must return to the top of with the turquoise figure in twelve days.

When they reached a level spot just below the summit of, was there waiting for them. , House God, was there. , Water Sprinkler, was there. With them was , the Wind. lay a perfect buckskin on the ground with its head facing the west. On the buckskin First Man lay the turquoise figure of a girl with her head to the west. Then placed another perfect buckskin over the figure, with its head facing East. The Holy People began to sing the sacred song of , and , the Wind entered between the buckskin blankets. The upper blanket was removed, and beneath it was a living baby girl. Her name was , Changing Woman. The Holy People told First Man and First Woman to take her to their home and raise her as their daughter.

First Woman and First man carried to their hogan, and First Man made a cradle board and tied her in it. &quot;Now she will be my daughter,&quot; he said. First woman took the baby and breathed on her four times. &quot;Now,&quot; she said, &quot;she will be my daughter.&quot; At the end of the second day the baby laughed for the first time. The Coyote named arrived and said, &quot;I was told that my grandchild laughed for the first time.&quot; First Woman took charcoal and gave it to the Coyote saying: &quot;This is the only thing that lasts.&quot; He painted his nose with it and said, &quot;I shall know all things. I shall live long by it.&quot; Satisfied with the gift, he departed. Since then persons always receive a gift when a baby laughs for the first time, and the First Laugh Ceremony is performed.

By the thirteenth day, had become a young woman, and on that day she said to First Woman, &quot;Something unusual has passed through me.&quot; First woman said, &quot;That is your first race, .&quot; They covered the floor of the hogan with blankets, and Changing Woman lay on them face down. First Man pulled her hair down, and shaped her face, and dressed her in beautiful goods, beads, bracelets, and earrings, and tied her hair with a strip of perfect buckskin. Then First Man and First Woman stepped outside the hogan and told to run her first race around a cedar tree and return, from east to west, as the sun does. When she returned, they invited all the people to a sing over her in the hogan called , Changeable House, on the mountain called four days later. A great crowd gathered in the evening of the fourth day. A sweet corn cake was made from different colored corn meal sweetened with yeast. The Night Chant was sung, and in the morning the men received some of the maiden&#x27;s cake as a gift for their chants, and , Changing Woman sat in the back of the hogan as gifts were piled in front of her. In this way the First Race of every young woman should be celebrated.

==== Birth of the Twins ====
Soon after that, Changing Woman wished for a mate. Every morning when the sun rose she lay on her back until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east. At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man&#x27;s moccasins and leggings were also white. The rider spoke: &quot;You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone.&quot;

Changing Woman returned home and told what had happened to her parents. First Man said that it could not be true, but First Woman said that it was indeed the message of a Holy Being and they must obey. And so First Man and prepared the hogan and the basket and waited long into the night. Finally First Man returned home. When Changing Woman returned home in the morning, First Man asked her at once: &quot;Who came last night?&quot; The girl said, &quot;No one came, but some of the meal has been taken.&quot; The same thing happened the second night, and the third. On the morning after the fourth night, the girl told First Man, &quot;I saw no one, but someone touched me, and I was moved.&quot; Four days later, said, &quot;Mother, something moves within me.&quot; First Woman answered, &quot;Daughter, that must be your baby moving.&quot;

On the ninth day, Changing Woman felt her birth labor begin. Talking God appeared, carrying a rope of sunbeam. Water Sprinkler the Rain God appeared carrying a rope of rainbow. Saying nothing, the two beings gave one end of each rope to Changing Woman and silently bid her pull them with each spasm of labor. This began the custom of giving a rope to a woman who is in labor. A baby boy emerged, and Talking God took it aside and washed it, and severed its cord. A second baby boy emerged, and Water Sprinkler took it aside and washed it and severed its cord.

==== Preparation of the Twins ====
After four days, , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler, returned. The twins had already grown into big boys. &quot; (Grandsons),&quot; Talking God said, &quot;We have come to run a race with you.&quot; &quot;We will see how fit you have become,&quot; said Water Sprinkler. They agreed to race around the mountain. The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower. But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and whipping them with switches of mountain mahogany. As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race. &quot;We will return in four days to race again,&quot; they said, and departed. In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, &quot;Practice each day and grow stronger.&quot; In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain. It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches. Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. And again in the evening came and encouraged them and urged them to train. Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end. Four days later they returned to race a final time. Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace. They led the whole way and won the race. &quot;Well done, ,&quot; said Talking God and Water Sprinkler. &quot;You have grown into what we wanted you to become. Now you can serve well those who have nurtured you.&quot;

The twins came to Changing Woman, , and asked, &quot;Mother, who is our father?&quot; &quot;You have no father,&quot; she said. &quot;We must have a father,&quot; replied the twins. &quot;We need to know who he is.&quot; &quot;Your father is a round cactus, then,&quot; said Changing Woman. &quot;Be still.&quot;

First Man made bows and arrows for the twins, and they traveled to the south to hunt. They saw a large black bird on a tree, and tried to hit it with an arrow, but it flew away. When they told Changing Woman this, she said, &quot;That was Raven, and he may be a spy for , the Monster Bird, who devours our people. Do not go there again.&quot; The following day the boys took their bows and headed west. They saw a large black bird with a red head, and tried to kill it, but it flew away. When they told Changing Woman this, she said, &quot;That was Vulture. He may be a spy for , the Monster that Kicks People Down Cliffs. Do not go there again.&quot; The next day they boys traveled north, and there they saw a black and white bird with a piercing voice. They tried to shoot it with their arrows, but it flew away. When they told their mother, she said, &quot;That was Magpie. He is a spy for , the Monster Who Kills With His Eyes. If he sees you he will paralyze you with his eyes and peck you to pieces.&quot; Changing Woman cried, &quot;Now the monsters know about you, and they will come to kill you. You must stay inside.&quot;

The next morning Changing Woman climbed a hill. Looking in the distance she saw many monsters approaching from the south and from the west and from the north. She made four sacred hoops. The white one she threw to the east. The blue one she threw to the south. The yellow one she threw to the west. The black one she threw to the north. At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan. &quot;The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter,&quot; she told her sons. We will be safe for one day. But tomorrow the power will be gone.&quot; At night, the twins spoke softly to one another. &quot;The monsters are coming for us,&quot; they said. &quot;We must leave so the others will be safe.&quot; Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.

==== The Journey to the Sun ====
By daybreak the twins were approaching the sacred mountain called . They saw smoke rising from the ground, and saw that it came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending. When they looked down into the entrance they saw an old woman sitting before a small fire. It was , Spider Woman. &quot;Enter, (my sons),&quot; she said in a raspy voice. &quot;Who are you and why do you walk on Atiin diyinii, the trail of the rainbow?&quot; The boys entered. &quot;We do not know who we are, and we do not know where we are going,&quot; said the twins. &quot;We are fleeing for our lives.&quot; &quot;You must tell me more,&quot; said Spider Woman. &quot;, Changing Woman, is our mother, and we flee , the Alien Monsters,&quot; said the boys. &quot;You are welcome here, and you can learn much from me,&quot; said Spider Woman. &quot;But you must tell me more.&quot; &quot;We are yátashkii, raised without a father,&quot; the twins said. &quot;Perhaps our father is a round cactus. We follow the Holy Trail because the monsters will destroy us if they can.&quot;

, Spider Woman, stood and extended her arms. &quot;I will tell you who your father is and how to go to him,&quot; she said, and she gestured to the first twin to sit on a chair of obsidian and to the second twin to sit on a chair of turquoise. She gave them food. Then she said, &quot;Your father is , the Sun. His dwelling is far to the east. The way is long and dangerous. Many monsters live between here and there. And your father may try to harm you.&quot; &quot;Tell us how to go there,&quot; said the twins. &quot;You must cross four dangerous places,&quot; said Spider Woman. You must pass the rocks that crush all travelers. You must cross the reeds that cut travelers to pieces. You must cross between the cane cactuses that cut travelers to shreds. Then you must pass the boiling sands that burn travelers to fine ashes. Beyond those four points no ordinary creature can pass. But I will give you a talisman that will help you.&quot; Saying this, she handed the boys the sacred , a hoop fashioned from the life feathers of monster eagles. &quot;Treat this charm carefully and use it correctly,&quot; she said. &quot;As you face your enemies, stare at them without fear, and extend the towards them. Then repeat this song:
&quot;Rub your feet with pollen and rest them. Rub your hands with pollen and rest them. Rub your body with pollen and lie at rest. Rub your head with pollen and put your mind to rest. Then truly your feet become pollen. Your hands become pollen. Your body becomes pollen. Your head becomes pollen. Your spirit will then become pollen. Your voice will then become pollen. All of you is as pollen is. And what pollen is, that is what peace is. The trail ahead is now a beautiful trail. Long life is ahead. Happiness is ahead.&quot; &quot;Now,&quot; she said, &quot;You are ready to go on. You have the power that you need. Walk in beauty.&quot;

The twins continued east on the Trail of the Rainbow until they came to a narrow pass between two high cliffs. The cliffs pulled apart as they approached. They walked quickly to the opening and stopped suddenly, and the cliffs slammed together in front of them. &quot;We are the children of , the Sun,&quot; the twins called. We go to him with a message from Spider Woman.&quot; &quot;Tell us the message,&quot; called a voice. The boys held out the naayééʼ atsʼos and sang the song Spider Woman had taught them. The cliffs parted, and the twins passed safely between them. Next they came to the slashing reeds, and again they held out the and sang the holy song, and passed safely through. They came next to the cane cactuses, , which sprang to life as they approached. Again with the and the song of Spider Woman they passed through safely. At last they came to , the Boiling Dunes, which began to swirl and boil when they approached. &quot;We must know who you are and where you come from and where you are going and to what purpose,&quot; roared the dunes. &quot;We are the children of , the Sun,&quot; the twins called. We come from . We go to our father with a message from Spider Woman.&quot; They held out the , and sang the song of Spider Woman, and the dunes subsided. &quot;Continue on,&quot; the dunes said. &quot;Long life is ahead. Happiness is ahead.&quot; To the east the twins saw the turquoise dwelling of the Sun.

==== Encounter with The Sun ====
The twins entered the house of the Sun before had completed his journey across the sky. They saw a woman sitting against the western wall, and they saw two handsome young men, , Black Thunder, and , Blue Thunder. No one spoke to them. &quot;We are from ,&quot; the twins said. &quot;Our mother is , Changing Woman, and we have been told that , the Sun, is our father. We have followed the Holy Trail to seek his help.&quot; The woman remained silent. Black Thunder and Blue Thunder approached the twins, and wrapped four blankets around them. They wrapped them in the blanket of red dawn, and the blanket of blue daylight, and the blanket of yellow evening, and the blanket of black darkness. Then Black Thunder and Blue Thunder lifted the bundled twins and lay them high on a shelf.

After a while the twins heard the Sun enter. He removed his glowing hot disk from his back and hung it on the wall. &quot;Who has come here today?&quot; he asked the woman. She did not answer. &quot;From above I saw two strangers come here,&quot; said . &quot;Where are they?&quot; The woman remained silent. &quot;I know that two strangers are here,&quot; said , &quot;And I demand to know where they are.&quot; &quot;Two young men did come here,&quot; said the woman, &quot;and they claim they are your sons. You have promised me that I am the only woman you see. So whose sons are these?&quot; and she went to the bundle and pulled on the blankets. The twins fell to the floor, and at once grasped the hoop of feathers that Spider Woman had given them. the Sun said, &quot;I will see if you are my sons,&quot; and he seized them at once and hurled them against the sharp spikes of white shell on the eastern wall of his house. The twins, holding the , bounced back unharmed. The Sun seized them again and hurled them against the turquoise spikes on his southern wall. Again they held the and bounced back unharmed. &quot;You must survive two more tests,&quot; said . He took them outside where there was a great sweathouse, and he started a fire to heat the four large rocks within it. While he did this, , the Wind, came up to the twins and whispered &quot;You must dig a tunnel to the outside and hide in it after you have answered his question.&quot; The twins dug the tunnel while the Sun prepared the fire, and hid its opening with a stone. The Sun then commanded them to enter the sweatlodge. After a while said, &quot;Is it hot in there?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; answered the twins, and then they hid in the tunnel they had dug. suddenly poured a great quantity of water through the hole in the top of the sweatlodge, and when it hit the hot rocks they exploded and hot steam hissed. After a while the twins crawled back into the sweatlodge. called, &quot;Is it hot in there?&quot; expecting to get no answer. But the twins answered, &quot;Not so hot as before.&quot; The Sun opened the door. &quot;Perhaps you truly are my sons,&quot; he said. &quot;Come inside, and we will smoke.&quot;

He turned and entered his house. As he did, , the Wind, came up beside the twins. &quot;The tobacco is poisonous,&quot; he whispered. &quot;The spittle of , the spiny caterpillar will protect you.&quot; At once the twins saw a spiny caterpillar on the path, and took some of its spittle into their mouths. Inside, , the Sun, brought forth a turquoise pipe from a high shelf on his eastern wall and lit it with the red sun disk. He puffed on it himself, and then passed it to the twins, who each puffed on it themselves. &quot;What sweet tobacco,&quot; said the twins. Seeing this, the Sun said, &quot;Truly you are my sons. Now tell me why you have come.&quot; &quot;Father,&quot; they said, &quot;we have come because , the Alien Monsters, are killing all our people. the Big Giant devours our people. , the Horned Monster, devours them. , the Bird Monster, devours them, and so does , who kills with his eyes. Give us weapons so that we may destroy and the others.&quot;

 looked in all four directions and saw that the woman was not in the house. Then he said, &quot;I will help you. But , the Big Giant, is also my son. I will give you weapons so that you may fight the monsters. But I am the one who will strike the first blow when you fight against the Big Giant. I must do that myself.&quot; Then he gave the twins helmets and shirts of hard flint scales, and , the chain lightning arrows, and , the sheet lightning arrows, and , the deadly sunbeam arrows. And to each he gave , the stone knife with the hard blade, and , the stone knife with the broad blade.

When the Sun left on his journey across the top of the sky the next morning, he took the twins with him. At noon they came to , the hole at the top of the sky. &quot;Now show me where you live,&quot; said the Sun. With the help of , the Wind, the twins, pointed out the four sacred mountains of the four directions, and , the Travelers&#x27; Circle Mountain, near the center. &quot;We live near there,&quot; they said. &quot;All that you have told me I now know to be true, my sons,&quot; said . &quot;You will succeed against the Monsters, and in your war against them you will make the final passage from boyhood to manhood.&quot; Then he sent down a streak of lightning onto the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain that was the home of , the Big Giant, and the twins slid down it.

=== The Destruction of the Monsters ===

==== The Slaying of Yéʼiitsoh, the Big Giant ====
It is said that the twin sons of Jóhonaaʼéí descended from the sky to the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain, and came down the mountain on its south slope. They walked on to , which some call Warm Spring. There they found , the Holy Boy, and , Spirit Girl. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked Holy Boy. &quot;We have come to find , the Big Giant,&quot; said the twins. &quot;He is huge, and very powerful,&quot; said Holy Boy. &quot;Each day he comes late in the day to , to drink from the lake.&quot; The next day at dawn the brothers walked to and stood beside the large lake. They took one of the chain lightning arrows their father had given them and shot it at a slab of high rock overhanging the base of Tsoodził. The arrow struck the rock with such force that it shattered and fell where it remains today. &quot;With such weapons as these we cannot fail,&quot; they said.

Late in the day they heard , the Big Giant, approaching. His footsteps shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water&#x27;s edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw the reflection of the twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, Then paced back and forth and said, &quot;What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?&quot; The twins shouted back, &quot;What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? And how shall we kill it?&quot; , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called &quot;Akóóh! Beware! Jump!&quot; and suddenly the twins found themselves standing on the end of a rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. , the Wind, whispered &quot;Keep low now!&quot; and hurled his great blue knife. It passed over them. The Wind said, &quot;Jump to the right!&quot; and the great yellow knife of passed just to their left. &quot;This is his last weapon,&quot; whispered the Wind. &quot;Jump to the left. Now!&quot; The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them.&quot; The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck the Giant on the side of the head. The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at . The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. fell face down on the ground. Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant&#x27;s mouth, and , the Wind said, &quot;Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!&quot; The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.

The twins approached the body of the Giant and saw that he was dead. The younger brother removed the Giant&#x27;s scalp as proof. Around his body lay many chips of flint from his armor. The twins hurled the flint in each of the four directions, saying, &quot;From now on the people of the earth shall use you.&quot; Then the older brother said to the young brother, &quot;I will call you , He Who Cuts Life Out of the Enemy.&quot; The younger brother then said to his older brother, &quot;And I will call you , Monster Slayer. It is the name by which you shall always be known.&quot; Then the two brothers climbed back to the top of , the Blue Bead Mountain where they had landed after descending from the sky, and each sang a song in praise of their father, Jóhonaaʼéí, the Sun, as he neared the end of his journey across the sky. Then they rested for the night.

The next morning the two brothers started for home. Along the trail they met , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler. &quot;Well done, nihinálí, our grandsons,&quot; they said. You are worthy of all that we taught you. You have served your people well.&quot; And the two gods each sang a song to celebrate the victory of the twins over , the Giant. These two songs are sung today whenever a victory is celebrated. When the brothers came close to the home of Changing Woman, their mother, and First Man and First Woman, they hid their armor and weapons and the scalp of in the bushes, and then went inside. Changing Woman rejoiced when she saw them. &quot;Where have you been?&quot; she asked. &quot;I thought a monster had devoured you.&quot; &quot;We followed , the Holy Trail,&quot; said the elder son, . &quot;We came upon , Spider Woman, and she told us how to go to the house of , our father the Sun. He gave us weapons, and with them we killed , the Big Giant.&quot; &quot;Do not say this,&quot; said First Man. &quot;No one can kill .&quot; Then the brothers led their mother and grandparents outside and showed them the scalp of Yéʼiitsoh, and they rejoiced. Together they sang and danced to celebrate the victory.

==== The Slaying of Déélgééd, the Horned Monster ====
, the elder brother, wished to fight the other monsters, it is said. He asked Changing Woman where the Horned Monster, , lived. Changing Woman said, &quot;He lives at , at the foot of the mountains. But you have done enough, my son, and the monsters are hard to kill.&quot; &quot;It was also hard for you to give birth to me,&quot; said . &quot;Where lives it is dangerous,&quot; said Changing Woman. &quot;To all the ends of the earth, there is no such place as Dangerous,&quot; answered . The brothers together made two prayer sticks of the medicine plant , each three finger widths long, and lay them in a turquoise dish. Then , Monster Slayer, said to , Who Cuts the Life Out of the Enemy, &quot;My brother, I will go alone to fight . You stay here and watch the holy medicine sticks. If a sunbeam should light either one, you will know that I am in danger, and you must help me. Otherwise, stay and protect the others.&quot;

At dawn set out to find , the Horned Monster. He came to a broad plain at the foot of the mountains, and saw lying at rest. It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While , Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, came up to him. &quot;I wonder what you are doing here,&quot; he said. &quot;There is someone here I seek,&quot; said Monster Slayer. &quot;Do you not fear , the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?&quot; asked Gopher. &quot;Now that you mention it, it is he I seek,&quot; said Monster Slayer. &quot;I wish to kill him.&quot; &quot;I can help you with that,&quot; said Gopher, &quot;but I want a piece of his hide.&quot; &quot;You shall have it,&quot; said . Then Gopher dug a tunnel right up to . He returned and said, &quot;I have tunneled right up to where he lies. And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North. You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart.&quot; , Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small. &quot;Raise your right leg,&quot; said Gopher. While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger. Then , Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where lay above the opening. He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into . The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. tore at the earth around the tunnel. Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west. dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down. , Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out. There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him. This was , the Ground Squirrel. &quot;,&quot; said Ground Squirrel. &quot;What brings you to this place?&quot; &quot;I am looking at something,&quot; said , Monster Slayer. &quot;I wonder what you are looking at,&quot; said Ground Squirrel. &quot;I am looking at ,&quot; said Monster Slayer. &quot;I wonder if I need fear him.&quot; &quot;I will go over there and see if he is dead,&quot; said Ground Squirrel. &quot;If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing. If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face.&quot; &quot;Truly, little brother,&quot; answered Monster Slayer, &quot;you shall have it.&quot; Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. Gopher came and removed some of &#x27;s skin and put it on his own back. So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. And Gopher gave part of the monster&#x27;s bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that was slain.

, Monster Slayer, returned to his home and showed the lung and bowel of Déélgééd to Changing Woman and First Woman. They danced and chanted in victory. Now two of the monsters were dead. The plan of the Holy People was being fulfilled.

=== Old Age, Cold, Poverty, and Hunger ===
In a few days, had killed , Monster Eagle, and , The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff, and , the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes. &quot;Surely the have all been destroyed now,&quot; said Changing Woman. , The Wind, whispered into the ear of Monster Slayer, &quot;Some still survive. , the Old Age Woman, still remains. She looks like a frail creature, but she slowly saps strength with the passing years. Beware of her.&quot; Monster Slayer said to his mother, &quot;Tell me where I can find the dwelling place of , The One Who Brings Old Age.&quot; &quot;There is no need for you to seek her,&quot; said Changing Woman. The Wind whispered, &quot;She lives among the mountains at a, the Place of Mountain Sheep.&quot;

When he arrived at , saw an old woman walking slowly toward him, leaning on a staff. Her back was bent. Her hair was white. Her arms and hands were bony. &quot;Old grandmother, I have come to kill you,&quot; he said. &quot;I do you no harm, grandson,&quot; she replied. &quot;Think it over before you kill me. Once the people discover that will no longer slowly sap their strength with the passing of years and finally devour them, they will have no children. It is better that people should pass on their wisdom and responsibilities to those who are younger, and finally die.&quot; &quot;I will spare you,&quot; replied . And he returned without a trophy.

&quot;, the Cold Woman, still lives,&quot; whispered The Wind to Monster Slayer. &quot;Each year she freezes the earth. She covers the streams with ice. She kills the plants so that the vines bear no melons and the stalks bear no corn.&quot; &quot;Mother,&quot; demanded , &quot;tell me where I might find the dwelling of .&quot; Changing Woman refused to answer. But , The Wind, whispered, &quot;She lives high on the summet of , where the mountain sheep are.&quot; Monster Slayer traveled to and found a lean old woman sitting above the tree line without clothing, on the snow. No roof sheltered her. Her skin was pale as the snow. &quot;Grandmother,&quot; said Monster Slayer, &quot;I am here to kill you.&quot; &quot;You may kill me,&quot; said Cold Woman. &quot;But once I am dead, it will always be hot on the earth. The land will dry up. The springs will cease to flow. Over the years the people will perish.&quot; Listening to her words, said, &quot;I will spare you.&quot; And he returned without a trophy.

&quot;, the Poverty Creatures, still live,&quot; whispered into his ear. They destroy people by gradually using up possessions. They will leave no tools for anyone to use, and no clothing to wear.&quot; Monster Slayer asked Changing Woman where the Poverty Creatures dwelled, but she refused to tell him. &quot;They live at , the Roof Butte Mountain,&quot; said . traveled there, and found a tattered old man and a filthy old woman. Their garments were in shreds, and in their house they had no goods. They had. no food, no baskets, no bowls. &quot;Grandmother, Grandfather,&quot; said Monster Slayer, &quot;It gives me no pleasure, but I have come to kill you. Then people will not suffer from want.&quot; &quot;Think a moment,&quot; they said. &quot;If we were to die, people would not replace anything, or improve on their tools. By causing things to wear out, we lead people to invent new things. Garments become more beautiful. Tools become more useful. People appreciate what they have.&quot; Monster Slayer said, &quot;What you say is true. I will spare you.&quot; And he returned without a trophy.

&quot;, Hunger Man, still exists,&quot; whispered . &quot;He lives at , White Spot of Grass.&quot; When he arrived there, found twelve ravenous creatures who ate anything that grew. The largest of them was Dichin Hastiin. &quot;I have come here to kill you,&quot; said . &quot;Then people will not feel the pangs of hunger and they will not starve for want of food.&quot; &quot;I do not blame you for wanting me dead,&quot; said . &quot;But if you kill us, people will lose their taste for food. They will never know the pleasure of cooking and eating. But if we live, they will continue to plant seeds and harvest crops, and they will remain skilled hunters.&quot; After hearing these words, Monster Slayer returned without a trophy.

When he returned home to his mother Changing Woman, he removed the sheath wherein he carried the stone knife that his father the Sun had given him. He realized that now his work was done. He sang:
&quot;Now the enemy slayer arrives&quot;
&quot;From the house of the jagged blades he arrives&quot;
&quot;From where the sharp knives hang he arrives&quot;
&quot;And the treasures he has won are yours, oh you gods.&quot;

=== Departure of Changing Woman ===
Changing Woman and and the younger twin, , who was also known as , Child of the Water, now heard a voice from the east chanting in reply: 
&quot;With the Slayer of Monsters I come.&quot; 
&quot;From the house of the dark stone blades I come.&quot; 
&quot;From where the dark stone knives hang I come.&quot; 
&quot;Giver of the sacred hoops I come.&quot; 
&quot;I come, I come! The dreaded one.&quot;
Changing Woman said, &quot;It is the voice of your father. Dress yourselves quickly.&quot; And then she left the hogan.

, the Sun, entered and greeted the twins. To he said, &quot;My son, have you slain all the enemies of the people?&quot; replied, &quot;Those who should die I have killed. I have been among the highest peaks, and I been through the deepest canyons. I have been to the edge of the waters, and I have been to the boundaries of the sky. And wherever I went I found no one who is not a friend to our people.&quot; &quot;Then your work is done,&quot; said . &quot;I will take the weapons I gave you back with me. Tell your mother that after four days I will return. I wish to speak with her on top of , the Giant Spruce Mountain.&quot; And he departed.

After four days, , Changing Woman, went to the summit of , the Giant Spruce Mountain, and sat on a rock near the spot where she had first felt the warmth of the sun deep within her body. , the Sun, came and sat beside her. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; she said. &quot;I want you for my own,&quot; he replied. &quot;Come to the west and make a home with me there.&quot; &quot;I wish no such thing,&quot; she said. &quot;I am lonely,&quot; said . &quot;What good is all that I do if I must endure my days and nights all alone?&quot; After a time a silence, spoke. &quot;I am told you have a beautiful house in the east. I want such a house in the west. I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company. Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean by making such demands of me?&quot; said . &quot;Why should I provide you with all of those things?&quot; &quot;I will tell you why,&quot; she said. &quot;You are male and I am female. You are of the sky and I am of the earth. You are constant in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us. If there is to be harmony, my request must matter to you. There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me.&quot;

At first gave no reply. He carefully weighed all that she had said. Then slowly he placed his arm around her. She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that all the things she wished for she would have. She would have a house in the west on the shimmering water. She would have gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.

When Changing Woman was ready to depart for her new home, the Mirage People and the Ground Mist People prepared to go with her. She said goodbye to First Man and First Woman and to her two sons. Then she and the Holy People passed through the mountains at (Red Knife), and in the Valley they celebrated her betrothal to . Her hips widened, and her breasts grew large. The elk and buffalo multiplied, and some left her herd to form other herds and spread across the land. At last she and her party and animals came to the end of the land, and then to her floating house beyond the shore. Then , Monster Slayer, and his brother , Water Born, traveled to , where the Pine River flows into the San Juan, and there they continue to live below the earth. A petroglyph was made on the canyon wall just above the water level to mark the place.

Then , the Sun, said that it was time for the first four Holy People to depart from the surface of the Fourth World. These four, who had come from the First World, were First Man, , First Woman, , , Great Coyote, and the coyote , First Angry. They traveled east, beyond the house of the Sun, and took all their powers with them. As they began to travel, First Woman turned and said, &quot;When I wish to do so, I will send back death from disease, and the sign will be the howl of the coyote.&quot; Then the four Holy People who had come up from the Third World departed as well. They were , Talking God, , Water Sprinkler, , House God, and , Black God, the god of fire. As they departed, said, &quot;If anyone sees us it will be a sign that an enemy is coming into the country. If he hears us call, that same person will be killed by an enemy before the day is over.&quot; And so saying they all returned to their homes and all their powers went with them.

, Changing Woman, began to live in her Floating White Bead House, beyond the shore in the west. In her home on a shelf running east to west on the south side were four water jars. The first was the Black Water Jar which contained the Black Cloud and the Male Rain. The second was the Blue Water Jar which contained the Blue Cloud and the Male Rain. The third was the Yellow Water Jar which contained the Yellow Cloud and the Male Rain. The fourth was the White Water Jar which contained the White Cloud and the Male Rain. On the north side of the home was a shelf running west to east and it were also four jars. The first was a Black Water Jar which contained the Black Vapor and the Female Rain. The second, the Blue Water Jar, contained the Blue Vapor and the Female Rain. The third, the Yellow Water Jar, contained Yellow Vapor and the Female Rain. And last, the White Water Jar, contained the White Vapor and the Female Rain. Other jars contained the seeds of plants and flowers.

As Changing Woman walks in the four directions from her house, she undergoes a change. She comes out of her house an old woman with a white bead walking stick. She walks towards the East and returns middle aged and she carries no walking stick. To the South she walks and she returns a young woman. She walks to the West and comes back a maiden. She goes North and returns a young girl. Often she and , the Sun are in harmony. At times they argue and does not return to her home at the end of his journey. At those times the sky is stormy and the whole world suffers.

<text>Cuyahoga County ( or ) is a large urban county located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. The county seat and most populous city is Cleveland. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,264,817, making it the second-most populous county in the state.

Cuyahoga County is situated on the southern shore of Lake Erie, across the U.S.–Canada maritime border. The county is bisected by the Cuyahoga River, after which it was named. &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; is an Iroquoian word meaning &quot;crooked river&quot;. It is the core county of the Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area and Cleveland–Akron–Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The land that became Cuyahoga County was previously part of the French colony of Canada (New France), which was ceded in 1763 to Great Britain and renamed Province of Quebec. In the early 1790s, the land became part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory, and it was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795. Cleveland was established one year later by General Moses Cleaveland near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River.

Cuyahoga County was created on June 7, 1807, and organized on May 1, 1810. Cleveland (then known as &quot;Cleaveland&quot;) was selected as the county seat in 1809. The county was later reduced in size by the creation of Huron, Lake, and Lorain counties.

==Government==
The Cuyahoga County Council and Executive exercise direct government over unincorporated areas of Cuyahoga County. As of 2012, this consisted of two small areas: Chagrin Falls Township and Olmsted Township.

Cuyahoga County had long been led by a three-member Board of County Commissioners, which is the default form of county government in the state. In July 2008, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents began raiding the offices of Cuyahoga County Commissioners and those of a wide range of cities, towns, and villages across Cuyahoga County. The investigation revealed extensive bribery and corruption across the area, affecting hundreds of millions of dollars in county contracts and business. The investigation led to the arrest of county commissioner Jimmy Dimora; county auditor Frank Russo; MetroHealth vice president John J. Carroll; former Strongsville councilman Patrick Coyne; former Ohio District Courts of Appeals judge Anthony O. Calabrese III; former Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas judge Bridget McCafferty; Cuyahoga County Sheriff Gerald McFaul; former Cleveland City Council member Sabra Pierce Scott; Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas judge Steven Terry; and a wide range of attorneys, building inspectors, consultants, contractors, school district employees, and mid and low level county workers.

On November 3, 2009, county voters overwhelmingly approved the adoption of a new county charter, which replaced the three-commissioner form of county government with an elected county executive and county prosecutor, and an 11-member county council. Each council member represents a single geographic district, with no at-large districts. The elected offices of auditor, clerk of courts, coroner, engineer, recorder, sheriff, and treasurer were abolished. The county executive was given authority to appoint individuals to these offices, which became part of the executive branch of the county. Summit County is the only other Ohio county with this form of government.

In the November 2, 2010, election, Lakewood Mayor Ed FitzGerald (D) defeated Matt Dolan (R) to become the first Cuyahoga County Executive. The first Cuyahoga County Council was also elected, with Democrats winning eight seats, while Republicans won three.

On September 25, 2018, Cuyahoga County passed legislation which specifically protects LGBTQ+ people in their anti-discrimination laws. The protections under the bill specify equal access for the LGBTQ+ community to employment, housing, and public accommodations. The county is one of 20 municipalities in Ohio with this specific protection. Alongside the new language, the legislation creates a three-person Commission of Human Rights for Cuyahoga County which would support citizens looking to file a discrimination complaint. This legislation evokes the Ohio Fairness Act, a bill currently stalled in the House and Senate which would amend this anti-discrimination legislation on a state level.

==Politics==

Like many major urban counties, Cuyahoga County is heavily Democratic. Given its New England heritage and diverse population, plus union and labor involvement, the county often provides the Democratic Party with the largest margins in Ohio. In the 19th century, the Western Reserve, which Cleveland is the economic center of &quot;probably the most intensely antislavery section of the country.&quot; It last voted Republican at the presidential level in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried it with a plurality. The last Republican presidential candidate to win an absolute majority was Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. However, it has occasionally voted Republican in statewide landslides since then, such as for John Kasich in the 2014 gubernatorial election and for George Voinovich in the 2004 Senate election.

Democratic strength is concentrated in the City of Cleveland and suburbs in eastern Cuyahoga County, such as Shaker Heights and Solon.

Republican strength is concentrated in the southern Cuyahoga County suburbs, such as Strongsville and North Royalton. Suburbs in western Cuyahoga County, such as North Olmsted and Westlake tend to be more moderate.

Since around 2016, formerly Democratic working-class suburbs such as Middleburg Heights and Parma have trended to the GOP, while formerly GOP upscale suburbs such as Bay Village and Chagrin Falls have trended Democratic.

==Health==
In 2014, Cuyahoga County ranked 65 out of 88 counties in Ohio for health outcomes. This ranking was based on multiple factors, including: premature death (7,975 years per 100,000 population, of potential life lost), adults who reported having poor or fair health (15%), average number of poor physical-health days reported in a 30-day period (3.3), average number of poor mental-health days reported in a 30-day period (4.1), and the percentage of births with low birth-weight (10.4%). Among these factors, Cuyahoga did worse than the Ohio average in premature death, poor mental-health days, and low birth-weight. Possible explanations as for why Cuyahoga County is lower in health outcomes than the average Ohio county include behavioral factors, access to clinical care, social and economic factors, and environmental factors.

The leading causes of death and disability in Cuyahoga County are chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. The cancer mortality rate for Cuyahoga is 192.7 per 100,000 people, the mortality rate due to heart disease is 204.2 per 100,000 people, and the percentage of adult residents who are obese is 26.2%.

===Community comparison of disparities===
According to the Fox Chase Cancer Center, a health disparity can be defined as the existence of inequalities that prevent certain members of a population group from benefiting from the same health status as other groups. Cuyahoga County has many health disparities when comparing cities and demographics. The Hough neighborhood of Cleveland and the suburb of Lyndhurst can be compared to illustrate some of the disparities. The communities are both in Cuyahoga County and are less than 10 miles apart. They also have similar populations, but a different racial breakdown according to the 2010 census. The Hough neighborhood&#x27;s population was 16,359 (96.1% Black or African American and 2.1% White American) and the Lyndhurst&#x27;s population was 14,001 (6.4% Black or African American and 90.3% White American). A 24-year disparity was seen in life expectancy between the communities. Hough neighborhood residents have a life expectancy of 64 years and residents in Lyndhurst have a life expectancy of 88.5 years. The annual median income in the Hough neighborhood is $13,630 while it is $52,272 in Lyndhurst. Data collected from the Center for Community Solutions indicated from 1990 to 2001, the rate of heart disease for residents of the Hough neighborhood was around four times that of Lyndhurst residents. The Lyndhurst rate of accidental deaths was nine times higher than the Hough neighborhood.
