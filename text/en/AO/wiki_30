<text>The New York Philharmonic is an American symphony orchestra based in New York City. Known officially as the &quot;Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York, Inc.&quot;, and globally known as the &quot;New York Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; (NYPO) or the &quot;New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra&quot;, it is one of the leading American orchestras popularly called the &quot;Big Five&quot;. The Philharmonic&#x27;s home is David Geffen Hall, at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

Founded in 1842, the orchestra is one of the oldest musical institutions in the United States and the oldest of the &quot;Big Five&quot; orchestras. Its 14,000th concert was given in December 2004.

==History==
===Founding and first concert, 1842===

The New York Philharmonic was founded in 1842 by the American conductor Ureli Corelli Hill, with the aid of the Irish composer William Vincent Wallace. The orchestra was then called the Philharmonic Society of New York. It was the third Philharmonic on American soil since 1799, and had as its intended purpose, &quot;the advancement of instrumental music.&quot; The first concert of the Philharmonic Society took place on December 7, 1842, in the Apollo Rooms on lower Broadway before an audience of 600. The concert opened with Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;, led by Hill himself. Two other conductors, German-born Henry Christian Timm and French-born Denis Etienne, led parts of the eclectic, three-hour program, which included chamber music and several operatic selections with a leading singer of the day, as was the custom. The musicians operated as a cooperative society, deciding by a majority vote such issues as who would become a member, which music would be performed and who among them would conduct. At the end of the season, the players would divide any proceeds among themselves.

===Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth and a new home, 1846===

After only a dozen public performances and barely four years old, the Philharmonic organized a concert to raise funds to build a new music hall. The centerpiece was the American premiere of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, to take place at Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan. About 400 instrumental and vocal performers gathered for this premiere, which was conducted by George Loder. The chorals were translated into what would be the first English performance anywhere in the world. However, with the expensive US$2.00 ticket price and a war rally uptown, the hoped-for audience was kept away and the new hall would have to wait. Although judged by some as an odd work with all those singers kept at bay until the end, the Ninth soon became the work performed most often when a grand gesture was required.

During the Philharmonic&#x27;s first seven seasons, seven musicians alternated the conducting duties. In addition to Hill, Timm and Étienne, these were William Alpers, George Loder, Louis Wiegers and Alfred Boucher. This changed in 1849 when Theodore Eisfeld was installed as sole conductor for the season. Eisfeld, later along with Carl Bergmann, would be the conductor until 1865. That year, Eisfeld conducted the orchestra&#x27;s memorial concert for the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln, but in a peculiar turn of events which were criticized in the New York press, the Philharmonic omitted the last movement, &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, as being inappropriate for the occasion. That year Eisfeld returned to Europe, and Bergmann continued to conduct the Society until his death in 1876.
===Competition, 1878===

Leopold Damrosch, Franz Liszt&#x27;s former concertmaster at Weimar, served as conductor of the Philharmonic for the 1876/77 season. But failing to win support from the Philharmonic&#x27;s public, he left to create the rival Symphony Society of New York in 1878. Upon his death in 1885, his 23-year-old son Walter took over and continued the competition with the old Philharmonic. It was Walter who would convince Andrew Carnegie that New York needed a first-class concert hall and on May 5, 1891, both Walter and Russian composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky conducted at the inaugural concert of the city&#x27;s new Music Hall, which in a few years would be renamed for its primary benefactor, Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie Hall would remain the orchestra&#x27;s home until 1962.

===Theodore Thomas===
The Philharmonic in 1877 was in desperate financial condition, caused by the paltry income from five concerts in the 1876/77 season that brought in an average of only $168 per concert. Representatives of the Philharmonic wished to attract the German-born, American-trained conductor Theodore Thomas, whose own Theodore Thomas Orchestra had competed directly with the Philharmonic for over a decade and which had brought him fame and great success. At first the Philharmonic&#x27;s suggestion offended Thomas because he was unwilling to disband his own orchestra. Because of the desperate financial circumstances, the Philharmonic offered Theodore Thomas the conductorship without conditions, and he began conducting the orchestra in the autumn of 1877. With the exception of the 1878/79 season—when he was in Cincinnati and Adolph Neuendorff led the group—Thomas conducted every season for 14 years, vastly improving the orchestra&#x27;s financial health while creating a polished and virtuosic ensemble. He left in 1891 to found the Chicago Symphony, taking 13 Philharmonic musicians with him.

Another celebrated conductor, Anton Seidl, followed Thomas on the Philharmonic podium, serving until 1898. Seidl, who had served as Wagner&#x27;s assistant, was a renowned conductor of the composer&#x27;s works; Seidl&#x27;s romantic interpretations inspired both adulation and controversy. During his tenure, the Philharmonic enjoyed a period of unprecedented success and prosperity and performed its first world premiere written by a world-renowned composer in the United States—Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, &quot;From the New World&quot;. Seidl&#x27;s sudden death in 1898 from food poisoning at age 47 was widely mourned. Twelve thousand people applied for tickets to his funeral at the Metropolitan Opera House and the streets were jammed for blocks with a &quot;surging mass&quot; of his admirers.

According to Joseph Horowitz, Seidl&#x27;s death was followed by &quot;five unsuccessful seasons&quot; under Emil Paur, music director from 1898 to 1902, and Walter Damrosch, who served for only one season, 1902/03. After that, he says, for several seasons (1903–1906) the orchestra employed guest conductors, including Victor Herbert, Édouard Colonne, Willem Mengelberg, Fritz Steinbach, Richard Strauss, Felix Weingartner, and Henry Wood.

===New management, 1909===
In 1909, to ensure the Philharmonic&#x27;s financial stability, a group of wealthy New Yorkers led by two women, Mary Seney Sheldon and Minnie Untermyer, formed the Guarantors Committee and changed the orchestra&#x27;s organization from a musician-operated cooperative to a corporate management structure. The Guarantors were responsible for bringing Gustav Mahler to the Philharmonic as principal conductor and expanding the season from 18 concerts to 54, which included a tour of New England. The Philharmonic was the only symphonic orchestra where Mahler worked as music director without any opera responsibilities, freeing him to explore the symphonic literature more deeply. In New York, he conducted several works for the first time in his career and introduced audiences to his compositions. Under Mahler, a controversial figure both as a composer and conductor, the season expanded, musicians&#x27; salaries were guaranteed, the scope of operations broadened, and the 20th-century orchestra was created.

In 1911, Mahler died unexpectedly, and the Philharmonic appointed Josef Stránský as his replacement. Many commentators were surprised by the choice of Stránský, whom they did not see as a worthy successor to Mahler. Stránský led all the orchestra&#x27;s concerts until 1920, and also made the first recordings with the orchestra in 1917.

===Mergers and outreach, 1921===
In 1921 the Philharmonic merged with New York&#x27;s National Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the present Washington, D.C. ensemble). With this merger it also acquired the imposing Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg. For the 1922/23 season Stránský and Mengelberg shared the conducting duties, but Stránský left after that season. For nine years Mengelberg dominated the scene, although other conductors, among them Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Igor Stravinsky, and Arturo Toscanini, led about half of each season&#x27;s concerts. During this period, the Philharmonic became one of the first American orchestras with an outdoor symphony series when it began playing low-priced summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in upper Manhattan. In 1920 the orchestra hired Henry Hadley as &quot;associate conductor&quot; given specific responsibility for the &quot;Americanization&quot; of the orchestra: each of Hadley&#x27;s concerts featured at least one work by an American-born composer. In 1922, harpist Stephanie Goldner became the orchestra&#x27;s first female member.

In 1924, the Young People&#x27;s Concerts were expanded into a substantial series of children&#x27;s concerts under the direction of American pianist-composer-conductor Ernest Schelling. This series became the prototype for concerts of its kind around the country and grew by popular demand to 15 concerts per season by the end of the decade.

Mengelberg and Toscanini both led the Philharmonic in recording sessions for the Victor Talking Machine Company and Brunswick Records, initially in a recording studio (for the acoustically recorded Victors, all under Mengelberg) and eventually in Carnegie Hall as electrical recording was developed. All of the early electrical recordings for Victor were made with a single microphone, usually placed near or above the conductor, a process Victor called &quot;Orthophonic&quot;; the Brunswick electricals used the company&#x27;s proprietary non-microphone &quot;Light-Ray&quot; selenium-cell system, which was much more prone to sonic distortion than Victor&#x27;s. Mengelberg&#x27;s first records for Victor were acousticals made in 1922; Toscanini&#x27;s recordings with the Philharmonic actually began with a single disc for Brunswick in 1926, recorded in a rehearsal hall at Carnegie Hall. Mengelberg&#x27;s most successful recording with the Philharmonic was a 1927 performance in Carnegie Hall of Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;. Additional Toscanini recordings with the Philharmonic, all for Victor, took place on Carnegie Hall&#x27;s stage in 1929 and 1936. By the 1936 sessions Victor, now owned by RCA, began to experiment with multiple microphones to achieve more comprehensive reproductions of the orchestra.

1928 marked the Philharmonic&#x27;s last and most important merger, with the New York Symphony Society. The Symphony had been quite innovative in its 50 years before the merger. It made its first domestic tour in 1882, introduced educational concerts for young people in 1891, and premiered works such as Gershwin&#x27;s Concerto in F and Holst&#x27;s &quot;Egdon Heath&quot;. The two institutions&#x27; merger consolidated extraordinary financial and musical resources. Of the new Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York, Clarence Hungerford Mackay, chairman of the Philharmonic Society, was chairman. President Harry H. Flagler of the Symphony Society was president of the merger. At the first joint board meeting in 1928, the Mackay said that &quot;with the forces of the two Societies now united... the Philharmonic-Symphony Society could build up the greatest orchestra in this country if not in the world.&quot;

===The Maestro, 1930===

The merger had ramifications for the musicians of both orchestras. Winthrop Sargeant, a violinist with the Symphony Society and later a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, recalled the merger as &quot;a sort of surgical operation in which twenty musicians were removed from the Philharmonic and their places taken by a small surviving band of twenty legionnaires from the New York Symphony. This operation was performed by Arturo Toscanini himself. Fifty-seventh Street wallowed in panic and recrimination.&quot; Toscanini, who had guest-conducted for several seasons, became the sole conductor and in 1930 led the group on a European tour that brought immediate international fame to the orchestra. Toscanini remained music director until 1936, then returned several times as a guest conductor until 1945.

That same year nationwide radio broadcasts began. The orchestra was first heard on CBS directly from Carnegie Hall. To broadcast the Sunday afternoon concerts, CBS paid $15,000 for the entire season. The radio broadcasts continued without interruption for 38 years. A legend in his own time, Toscanini proved a tough act to follow as the country headed into war.

===The War years, 1940===
After an unsuccessful attempt to hire the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, the English conductor John Barbirolli and the Polish conductor Artur Rodziński jointly replaced Toscanini in 1936. The next year, Barbirolli was given the full conductorship, a post he held until 1941. In December 1942, Bruno Walter was offered the music directorship, but declined, citing his age (he was 67). In 1943, Rodziński, who had conducted the orchestra&#x27;s centennial concert at Carnegie Hall the previous year, was appointed music director. He had also conducted the Sunday afternoon radio broadcast when CBS listeners around the country heard the announcer break in on Arthur Rubinstein&#x27;s performance of Brahms&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto to inform them of the attack on Pearl Harbor. (Initial word of the attack was forwarded by CBS News correspondent John Charles Daly on his own show before the Philharmonic broadcast.) Soon after the U.S. entered World War II, Aaron Copland wrote &quot;A Lincoln Portrait&quot; for the Philharmonic at the request of conductor Andre Kostelanetz as a tribute to and expression of the &quot;magnificent spirit of our country.&quot;

Rodziński, Walter, and Sir Thomas Beecham made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records during the 1940s. Many of the sessions were held in Liederkranz Hall, on East 58th Street, a building formerly belonging to a German cultural and musical society, and used as a recording studio by Columbia Records. Sony Records later digitally remastered the Beecham recordings for reissue on CD.

===The Telegenic Age, 1950===
In February 1947, Rodziński resigned; Walter was once again approached, and this time he accepted the position on the condition that the title be reduced to &quot;Music Adviser&quot;; he resigned in 1949. Leopold Stokowski and Dimitri Mitropoulos were appointed co-principal conductors in 1949, with Mitropoulos becoming musical director in 1951. Known for championing new composers and obscure operas-in-concert, Mitropoulos pioneered in other ways, adding live Philharmonic performances between movies at the Roxy Theatre and taking Edward R. Murrow and the &quot;See It Now&quot; television audience on a behind-the-scenes tour of the orchestra. He made a series of recordings for Columbia Records, mostly in mono; near the end of his tenure, he recorded excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in stereo. In 1957, Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein served together as Principal Conductors until, in the course of the season, Bernstein was appointed music director, becoming the first American-born-and-trained conductor to head the Philharmonic.

Bernstein, who had made his historic, unrehearsed and spectacularly successful debut with the Philharmonic in 1943, was music director for 11 seasons, a time of significant change and growth. Two television series were initiated on CBS: the &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot; and &quot;Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic&quot;. The former, launched in 1958, made television history, winning every award in the field of educational television. Bernstein continued the orchestra&#x27;s recordings with Columbia Records until he retired as music director in 1969. He made a few recordings for Columbia after 1969, but most of his later recordings were for Deutsche Grammophon. Sony has digitally remastered Bernstein&#x27;s numerous Columbia recordings and released them on CD as a part of its extensive &quot;Bernstein Century&quot; series. The Philharmonic performed primarily in Carnegie Hall until 1962, but Bernstein preferred to record in the Manhattan Center. His later recordings were made in Philharmonic Hall. In 1960, the centennial of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s birth, Bernstein and the Philharmonic began a historic cycle of recordings of eight of Mahler&#x27;s nine symphonies for Columbia Records. (Symphony No. 8 was recorded by Bernstein with the London Symphony.) In 1962 Bernstein caused controversy with his comments before a performance by Glenn Gould of the First Piano Concerto of Johannes Brahms.

=== Modern music, 1962 ===

In 1962, Bernstein hired the orchestra&#x27;s first Black member, violinist Sanford Allen. Bernstein, a lifelong advocate of living composers, oversaw the beginning of the orchestra&#x27;s largest commissioning project, resulting in the creation of 109 new works for orchestra. In September 1962, the Philharmonic commissioned Aaron Copland to write a new work, &quot;Connotations for Orchestra&quot;, for the opening concert of the new Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The move to Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center brought about an expansion of concerts into the spring and summer. Among the many series that have taken place during the off-season have been the French-American and Stravinsky Festivals (1960s), Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Rug Concerts&quot; in the 1970s, and composer, Jacob Druckman&#x27;s Horizon&#x27;s Festivals in the 1980s.

The orchestra celebrated its 125th birthday on December 7, 1967, with a concert attended by over 200 soloists, conductors, and composers who had previously appeared with the orchestra. The concert was followed by a reception at Lincoln Center&#x27;s New York State Theater.

In 1971, Pierre Boulez became the first Frenchman to hold the post of Philharmonic music director. Boulez&#x27;s years with the orchestra were notable for expanded repertoire and innovative concert approaches, such as the &quot;Prospective Encounters&quot; which explored new works along with the composer in alternative venues. During his tenure, the Philharmonic inaugurated the &quot;Live From Lincoln Center&quot; television series in 1976, and the orchestra continues to appear on the Emmy Award-winning program to the present day. Boulez made a series of quadraphonic recordings for Columbia, including an extensive series of the orchestral music of Maurice Ravel.

Members of the New York Philharmonic string section are heard on the 1971 John Lennon album &quot;Imagine&quot;, credited as &#x27;&quot;The Flux Fiddlers&quot;.

===Ambassadors abroad===

Zubin Mehta, then one of the youngest of a new generation of internationally known conductors, became music director in 1978. His tenure was the longest in Philharmonic history, lasting until 1991. Throughout his time on the podium, Mehta showed a strong commitment to contemporary music, presenting 52 works for the first time. In 1980 the Philharmonic, always known as a touring orchestra, embarked on a European tour marking the 50th anniversary of Toscanini&#x27;s trip to Europe.

Kurt Masur, who had been conducting the Philharmonic frequently since his debut in 1981, became music director in 1991. Notable aspects of his tenure included a series of free Memorial Day Concerts at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and annual concert tours abroad, including the orchestra&#x27;s first trip to mainland China. He presided over the 150th Anniversary celebrations during the 1992–1993 season. His tenure concluded in 2002, and he was named music director emeritus of the Philharmonic.

=== A third century, 2000 ===
In 2000, Lorin Maazel made a guest-conducting appearance with the New York Philharmonic in two weeks of subscription concerts after an absence of over twenty years, which was met with a positive reaction from the orchestra musicians. This engagement led to his appointment in January 2001 as the orchestra&#x27;s next music director. He assumed the post in September 2002, 60 years after making his debut with the orchestra at the age of twelve at Lewisohn Stadium. In his first subscription week he led the world premiere of John Adams&#x27; &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot; commissioned in memory of those who died on September 11, 2001. Maazel concluded his tenure as the Philharmonic&#x27;s music director at the end of the 2008/09 season.

In 2003, due to ongoing concerns with the acoustics of Avery Fisher Hall, there was a proposal to move the New York Philharmonic back to Carnegie Hall and merge the two organizations, but this proposal did not come to fruition.

====Visit to North Korea, 2008====

The Philharmonic performed in Pyongyang at the invitation of the North Korean government on February 26, 2008. The event was the first significant cultural visit to the country from the United States since the end of the Korean War. The concert was held at East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, with a program including the national anthems of both North Korea (&quot;Aegukka&quot;) and the United States (&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;), the Prelude to Act III of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; by Richard Wagner, Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 9 &quot;From the New World&quot;&quot;, George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Farandole&quot;, Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Overture to Candide&quot;, and the popular Korean folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;. The Dvořák, Gershwin, and Bernstein works were each originally premiered by the New York Philharmonic.

The visit was anticipated as an opportunity to broaden relations with one of the world&#x27;s most isolated nations. The U.S. State Department viewed the invitation as a potential softening of anti-U.S. propaganda. In response to initial criticism of performing a concert limited to the privileged elite, the New York Philharmonic arranged for the concert to be broadcast live on North Korean television and radio. It was additionally broadcast live on CNN and CNN International. It was also shown on South Korea&#x27;s Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation to the entire nation of the Republic of Korea (ROK).

===Recent history===
On July 18, 2007, the Philharmonic named Alan Gilbert as its next music director, effective with the 2009/10 season, with an initial contract of five years. On May 5, 2010, the New York Philharmonic performed its 15,000th concert, a milestone unmatched by any other symphony orchestra in the world. In October 2012, the orchestra extended Gilbert&#x27;s contract through the 2016–2017 season. In February 2015, the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of Gilbert&#x27;s tenure its music director after the close of the 2016/17 season.

In January 2016, the orchestra announced the appointment of Jaap van Zweden as its next music director, effective with the 2018–2019 season, with an initial contract of five years. van Zweden served as music director designate for the 2017–2018 season. In September 2021, van Zweden stated his intention to stand down as the orchestra&#x27;s music director at the close of the 2023–2024 season.

In 2018 the Philharmonic changed its dress code, allowing its female musicians to wear pants at its evening concerts; they had been required to wear floor-length black skirts or gowns at them before this.

Past presidents and chief executive officers (CEO) of the orchestra have included Deborah Borda. Borda had previously held the same posts, as well as the post of managing director, with the orchestra. Borda stood down as the orchestra&#x27;s president and CEO on June 30, 2023. In June 2022, the orchestra announced the appointment of Gary Ginstling as its next president and CEO, effective July 1, 2023. Ginstling took the title of executive director with the orchestra in the autumn of 2022.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the orchestra was unable to give live concerts in David Geffen Hall as of March 2020. Renovation of David Geffen Hall commenced during the pandemic, with a scheduled reopening of the renovated hall at the start of the 2022–2023 season. The orchestra performed concerts at other New York City venues during the 2021–2022 season, including Alice Tully Hall, the Rose Theater, and Carnegie Hall.

In November 2022, the orchestra was made up of a majority of women—45 women and 44 men—for the first time in its history. It still had only one Black member—principal clarinetist Anthony McGill—just as it had in 1962.

Gustavo Dudamel first guest-conducted the New York Philharmonic in 2007. Following 26 additional guest-conducting appearances with the orchestra, the New York Philharmonic announced, in February 2023, the appointment of Dudamel as its next music director, effective with the 2026–2027 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.

In April 2024, the orchestra&#x27;s management commissioned an outside investigation after years of news reports of a culture of sexual harassmenent within the organization. On July 11, 2024, Ginstling resigned as the orchestra&#x27;s president and chief executive, with immediate effect. In December 2024, the orchestra announced the appointment of Matías Tarnopolsky as its next president and chief executive officer, effective January 1, 2025.

==Archives==
The New York Philharmonic Archives documents the history of the Philharmonic through visual and ephemeral history and printed music collections. The collection dates back to the beginning of the Philharmonic&#x27;s history in 1842. The Archives are sponsored by the Leon Levy Foundation and are located at Lincoln Center.

In recent years, the Archives has undertaken a digitization project to digitize all of its materials between 1943 and 1970 in a digital archive called &quot;The International Era, 1943–1970.&quot;

<text>SPECTRE (&quot;Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion&quot;) is a fictional organisation featured in the James Bond novels by Ian Fleming, as well as films and video games based in the same universe. Led by criminal mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld, SPECTRE first formally appeared in the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1961) and in the film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). The international organisation is not aligned with any nation or political ideology, enabling the later Bond books and Bond films to be regarded as somewhat apolitical. The presence of former Gestapo members in the organization can be considered as a sign of Fleming&#x27;s warnings about Nazi fugitives after the Second World War, as first detailed in the novel &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1954). In the novels, SPECTRE begins as a small group of criminals, but in the films it is depicted as a vast international organisation with its own SPECTRE Island training base capable of replacing the Soviet SMERSH.

==Philosophy and goals==
In the novels, SPECTRE is an organised crime enterprise led by Blofeld. The organisation&#x27;s executive consists of 21 individuals, 18 of whom handle day-to-day affairs. Members are drawn in groups of three from six of the world&#x27;s most notorious organisations — the Nazi German Gestapo, the Soviet SMERSH, Yugoslav Marshal Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s OZNA, the Italian Mafia, the French-Corsican Unione Corse, and KRYSTAL, a massive Turkish heroin-smuggling operation. Coincidentally, the three from KRYSTAL are all former members of RAHIR, an intelligence agency previously run by Blofeld. The remaining three members are Blofeld himself and two scientific/technical experts who make their debut in the ninth Bond novel, &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1961). When Fleming was writing the novel in 1959, he believed that the Cold War might end during the two years it would take to produce the film, and he came to the conclusion that the inclusion of a contemporary political villain would leave the film looking dated. Therefore, he thought it better to create a politically neutral enemy for Bond. Fleming&#x27;s SPECTRE has elements inspired by mafia syndicates and organised crime rings that were actively hunted by law enforcement in the 1950s. The strict codes of loyalty and silence, and the hard retributions that followed violations, were hallmarks of American gangster rings, the Italian Mafia, the Russian mafia, the Unione Corse, the Chinese Tongs and Triads, and the Japanese Yakuza and Black Dragon Society. During the events of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, SPECTRE successfully hijacked two nuclear warheads for ransom.

The organisation is next mentioned in the tenth novel, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1962), when Bond describes investigating their activities in Toronto before the story begins, though they play no part in the story itself. The organisation&#x27;s third appearance is in the eleventh novel, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1963) where Blofeld, hired by an unnamed country or party—though the Soviet Union is implied—is executing a plan to ruin British agriculture with biological warfare. Blofeld, with a weakened SPECTRE, would appear for the final time in the twelfth novel, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964). By this point, the organisation has largely been shut down, and what remains is focused on maintaining Blofeld&#x27;s alias as Dr. Guntram von Shatterhand and his compound in Japan.

In the films, the organisation often acts as a third party in the ongoing Cold War. Their objectives have ranged from supporting Dr. Julius No in sabotaging American rocket launches, holding the world to ransom, and demanding clemency from governments for their previous crimes. The goal of world domination was only ever stated in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; when SPECTRE was working on behalf of an unnamed Asian government. This is strongly implied to be Red China, who earlier backed Auric Goldfinger in the film of the same name.

Its long-term strategy, however, is illustrated by the analogy of the three Siamese fighting fish Blofeld keeps in an aquarium aboard SPECTRE&#x27;s yacht in the film version of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Blofeld notes that one fish is refraining from fighting two others until their fight is concluded. Then, that cunning fish attacks the weakened victor and kills it easily. Thus SPECTRE&#x27;s main strategy is to instigate conflict between two powerful enemies, namely the superpowers, hoping that they will exhaust themselves and be vulnerable when it seizes power. SPECTRE thus works with, and against, both sides of the Cold War. For example, in the film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, it simultaneously blackmails a Japanese double agent, distributes Red Chinese narcotics in the United States, kills a defector to the USSR on behalf of the French Foreign Ministry, and threatens NATO with stolen nuclear weapons, while continuing ordinary criminal operations such as advising on the British Great Train Robbery.

In both the film and the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the physical headquarters of the organisation are in Paris, operating behind a front organisation aiding refugees named &quot;Firco&quot; (&quot;Fraternité Internationale de la Résistance Contre l&#x27;Oppression&quot;) in the novels and &quot;International Brotherhood for the Assistance of Stateless Persons&quot; in the films. Organisational discipline is notoriously draconian, with the penalty for disobedience or failure being death. To heighten the impact of executions, Blofeld had been known to focus attention on an innocent member, making it appear his death is imminent, only to suddenly strike down the actual target when that person is off guard.

==Leadership==
SPECTRE is headed by the criminal mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld who usually appears accompanied by a Chinchilla Silver Persian cat in the films, but not in the books. In both the films and the novels, Emilio Largo is the second in command. It is stated in the novel that if something were to happen to Blofeld, Largo would assume command. Largo appears in the 1961 novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the 1965 film version and its 1983 remake, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, where he is renamed Maximilian Largo and is said to be Romanian rather than Italian.

The SPECTRE cabinet had a total of twenty-one members. Blofeld was the chairman and leader because he founded the organisation and Largo was elected by the cabinet to be second in command. A physicist named Kotze (who later defected) and an electronics expert named Maslov were also included in the group for their expertise on scientific and technical matters.

Members are typically referred to by number rather than by name. In the novels, the numbers were initially assigned at random and then rotated up by two digits on a once-a-month basis to prevent detection; for example, if a SPECTRE operative is titled &#x27;Number 1&#x27; in the present month, the security system will designate them &#x27;Number 3&#x27; in the next month, &#x27;Number 5&#x27; in the following month and so forth. However, in the EON films the number indicates rank within the organisation: Blofeld is always referred to as &#x27;Number 1&#x27; and Emilio Largo, in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, is &#x27;Number 2&#x27;. This particular example of numbering is perhaps deliberately borrowed from revolutionary organisations, where members exist in cells, and are numerically defined to prevent identification and cross-betrayal of aims. By deliberately drawing attention away from the true leader of the organisation, he is protected by masquerading as a target of lower importance, and the structure of the organisation is also obscured from intelligence services.

Members who fail missions are immediately executed, usually in gory and spectacular ways. In the novel, Blofeld electrocutes one member in his chair for sexually molesting a girl who had been kidnapped by the organisation; he had previously strangled a second to death with a garrote and shot a third through the heart with a compressed-air pistol. In the film, Number 9 is electrocuted for embezzlement at the &quot;Thunderball&quot; meeting where he and Number 11 report on the proceeds from a narcotics-related operation. The merciless killing of assistant Helga Brandt in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, for failing to kill James Bond, similarly horrifies visiting Red Chinese agents; she is dropped into a pool of piranha, which quickly eat her alive.

Previously, in &quot;From Russia with Love,&quot; Kronsteen was killed with a poisoned shoe knife in front of Rosa Klebb to motivate Klebb to complete her mission with no further delays. Blofeld prefers to accuse another operative as a decoy, keeping his victim calm inside the trap before executing them.

==Appearances==

===Novels===
In the original Bond novel series, SPECTRE&#x27;s first and last appearance as a worldwide power is in the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;. In it, SPECTRE attempts to conduct nuclear blackmail against NATO. Apparently disbanded afterwards, SPECTRE is said to be active again in the next book, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, although the organisation is not involved in the plot. In &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, the second chapter of what is known as the &quot;Blofeld Trilogy&quot;, Blofeld has revived SPECTRE where he attempts to carry out biological warfare against the United Kingdom. Blofeld&#x27;s final appearance is in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, where SPECTRE has largely disbanded.

Later, the John Gardner Bond novel, &quot;For Special Services&quot; introduces a revived SPECTRE led by Blofeld&#x27;s daughter, Nena Bismaquer. Although Bond ultimately prevents SPECTRE from reforming, the organisation continues under the leadership of Tamil Rahani to play a part in &quot;Role of Honour&quot; and &quot;Nobody Lives for Ever&quot;. The next Bond novelist, Raymond Benson, reintroduces Irma Bunt, Blofeld&#x27;s assistant, in his short story &quot;Blast From the Past&quot;, which is a sequel to &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

===Films===

In the EON Productions&#x27;s James Bond series, which began in 1962 with &quot;Dr. No&quot;, SPECTRE plays a more prominent role. The organisation is mentioned as being affiliated with Dr. No, although the main organisation in the movie is No&#x27;s personal army. In the novel, Dr. No worked for the USSR. In the films, SPECTRE usually replaced SMERSH as the main villain, although there is a brief reference to SMERSH in the second EON Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963). The film adaptation of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; also features the first on-screen appearance of Blofeld, although he is only identified by name in the closing credits of the film and his face is not seen at all. SPECTRE also serves as the primary antagonist of the film, orchestrating a plan to humiliate and kill James Bond as revenge for the death of Dr. No.

After being absent from the third film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), SPECTRE returns in the fourth film, &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), which closely mirrors the events of the novel, and subsequently is featured in the following films. During the events of the fifth film, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), they attempt to incite a war between the United States and Soviet Union. In film number six, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), Blofeld develops a biological warfare program and plans to demand clemency and recognition of a claimed title of nobility. SPECTRE&#x27;s final appearance is in the seventh film, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), where they attempt to forcibly disarm the Cold War powers. SPECTRE was dismantled for good after &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. Following &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, SPECTRE and Blofeld were retired from the EON Films series, except for a cameo by a character implied to be Blofeld in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981) in which said character is killed. Partly owing to a copyright dispute between rival Bond producers Albert R. Broccoli and Kevin McClory, the character is never referred to by name and is credited as &quot;Wheelchair Villain&quot;, though the closed captions for the film later refer to him as Blofeld.

===Rebooted Continuity===

The organisation returns in the rebooted Daniel Craig series of Bond films, which are set in an entirely separate universe to the earlier movies. In the 2015 film &quot;Spectre&quot;, the organisation is simply referred to by that title. In the film, Bond is posthumously sent by Judi Dench&#x27;s M to assassinate Marco Sciarra, which in turn leads him on the trail of the organisation. It is revealed throughout the course of the film that SPECTRE, and in turn Ernst Stavro Blofeld, have been the power behind the previous Craig villains; the Quantum organisation from &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; is revealed to be a subsidiary of SPECTRE, while Raoul Silva from &quot;Skyfall&quot; is shown to be affiliated with the organisation as well. In addition to Silva, Le Chiffre, Mr. White, and Dominic Greene are all revealed to have a direct connection to SPECTRE. It is also revealed that Blofeld is really Franz Oberhauser, whose father Hannes adopted Bond after the latter was orphaned at age 11, and who murdered his father and faked his own death.

Using SPECTRE, Blofeld attempts to gain control of a global surveillance program called Nine Eyes. Bond, M, and Q manage to stop them and Blofeld is captured by MI6 and sent to prison for his crimes.

This iteration of SPECTRE returns in the 2021 film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, where they remain at large despite Blofeld&#x27;s imprisonment and attempt to assassinate Bond in Matera. Five years later, the organisation kidnaps MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev and takes &quot;Project Heracles&quot;, a DNA-targeted bioweapon.

Every high- and mid-level ranking SPECTRE member meets in Cuba, and it is revealed that Blofeld is still in control of the organisation, despite being imprisoned in Britain. Bond sneaks in to the meeting and is ordered by Blofeld to be killed by the nanobots, but Obruchev secretly had the DNA changed from Bond to every SPECTRE member and anyone related to them, killing every SPECTRE member at the meeting. The main antagonist of the film, Lyutsifer Safin, seeks revenge against the organisation after Blofeld ordered Mr. White to murder his entire family. As the bioweapon kills SPECTRE members and their relatives around the world, the organisation is destroyed.

With Blofeld as the last surviving member of the organisation, Safin blackmails Madeleine Swann into infecting Blofeld with Heracles. Swann backs out after she unintentionally infects Bond, but the mission is a success when Bond attacks Blofeld, who is infected and dies.

The remaining survivors of SPECTRE, (ie, Primo) defect to Safin, and are killed at the ending of the film, destroying SPECTRE once and for all.

===Non-EON film appearances===
In 1983 Warner Bros. released &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; starring Sean Connery, based on the same original source material as &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The film retells the basic story of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, albeit with some new characters and in an updated setting. It reintroduces both SPECTRE and Blofeld, although he is not the main villain and neither is the organization disbanded afterwards like in the novel.

===Video games===
SPECTRE is shown but never mentioned by name in the game &quot;&quot;. Instead it is referred to as a &quot;powerful criminal organisation.&quot; It is depicted as being much more powerful than it was in any of the films or books, possessing a massive undersea black market known as &quot;The Octopus&quot;, a large lair built into an extinct volcano, resembling Karl Stromberg&#x27;s Atlantis lair from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Also included are the personal structures of its members, such as Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s Auric Enterprises facility and casino and Dr. No&#x27;s Crab Key. SPECTRE also possesses extremely advanced technology, such as virtual reality and energy generators in its volcanic lair.

Although the &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; game mirrors much of the plot of the eponymous film, it uses an organisation called OCTOPUS rather than SPECTRE to avoid copyright issues.

===Comics===
A version of SPECTRE similar to the novels was featured in the comic strips published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper between 1958 and 1983. The organisation however didn&#x27;t appear in the comic books until &quot;Eidolon&quot;, a miniseries published by Dynamite Entertainment in 2016, written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Jason Masters. In this comic, SPECTRE has a World War II organisation that is mostly defunct. Loyalists endured as plants and sleeper agents in the aftermath of a Warsaw Pact surge, waiting for the right moment for SPECTRE to have a reformation and resurgence.

==Copyright issues==
SPECTRE and its characters were at the centre of long-standing litigation between Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming over the film rights to &quot;Thunderball&quot; and the ownership of the organisation and its characters. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, giving him the film rights to &quot;Thunderball;&quot; the literary rights stayed with Fleming and thus allowed continuation author John Gardner to use SPECTRE in a number of his novels.

In 1963, EON Productions producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman made an agreement with McClory to adapt the novel into the fourth James Bond film, also stipulating that McClory would not be allowed to make further adaptations of &quot;Thunderball&quot; for at least ten years after the release. Although SPECTRE and Blofeld were used in a number of films before and after &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the issue over the copyright of &quot;Thunderball&quot; prevented SPECTRE and Blofeld from becoming the main villains in 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. In 1983, McClory released a film based on his Bond rights entitled &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;.

In 1998, MGM/UA took legal action against Sony and McClory in the United States to prevent &quot;Warhead 2000 AD&quot; from going into production. MGM/UA abandoned the claim after settling with Sony. McClory&#x27;s Bond rights, including his rights in SPECTRE, were unaffected.

On 15 November 2013, MGM and the McClory estate announced that they had formally settled the issue with Danjaq, LLC and MGM had acquired the full copyright to the characters and concepts of Blofeld and SPECTRE. Having lost its mantle of acronym, now simply called Spectre, the organisation and Blofeld were the main antagonists in the first Bond film released after the settlement, &quot;Spectre&quot;.

==SPECTRE henchmen==

Henchmen working for SPECTRE, one of its members, or directly for Ernst Stavro Blofeld:

===Novels===
* Emilio Largo – Second in command of SPECTRE and designated by Blofeld to oversee all field operations for Thunderball; killed by Domino Vitali.

As a punishment, Blofeld electrocuted Borraud and returned half of the ransom money to the girl&#x27;s father as compensation. While Blofeld considered the possibility that the sexual relationship was consensual, it was more important that SPECTRE was reputed to keep its word.
* Marius Domingue – &quot;Number 7&quot;, another Unione Corse man; highly trustworthy, but singled out by Blofeld for a lecture to throw Borraud off guard.

* Italy: SPeciale Esecutivo per Controspionaggio, Terrorismo, Ritorsioni e Estorsioni (in English: &quot;SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Retaliation and Extortion&quot;, because &quot;revenge&quot; in Italian is translated &quot;vendetta&quot;).
** In some Italian movies, the organisation is called SuPremo Esecutivo per Controspionaggio, Terrorismo, &quot;V&quot;endette ed Estorsioni (in English: &quot;SuPreme Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenges and Extortion&quot;), but is called anyway &quot;SPECTRE&quot;.
* Spain: Sociedad Permanente Ejecutiva para el Contraespionaje, Terrorismo, Rebeldía y Aniquilamiento (in English: &quot;Permanent Executive Society for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Rebellion and Annihilation&quot;, the abbreviation changes the last letter in Spanish language)

==Parodies and clones==

SPECTRE has been parodied many times in films, video games, and novels. The most obvious is the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series of films, with a Dr. Evil (a parody of Ernst Stavro Blofeld) and his second-in-command known as &quot;Number Two&quot; (a parody of Emilio Largo).
Other examples are:
*The Belgian comics series &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot; features an international criminal organisation called the Triangle whose members also address each other by numbers.
*Prior to &quot;Dr. No&quot;, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; featured a &quot;third force&quot; organisation the Third Echelon.
*In the video game series &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; a man simply called &quot;The director&quot; leads a similar organisation called &quot;H.A.R.M.&quot;. A running joke during the series is that no one actually knows what H.A.R.M. stands for. H.A.R.M may jokingly refer to Human Aetiological Relations Machine, the name of a fictional intelligence agency featured in the 1960s spy film &quot;Agent for H.A.R.M.&quot;.
*The TV series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; had, as its adversary, a shadowy organisation known as THRUSH (the Terrestrial Hegemony for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humankind). THRUSH (which, in the novels, stood for &quot;Technological Hierarchy for Removal of Undesirables and Subjugation of Humanity&quot;) was opposed by the titular United Nations Counterintelligence LEague.
*The TV series &quot;Rambo: the Force of Freedom&quot; featured a neo-Nazi organisation known as SAVAGE (Specialist-Administrators of Vengeance, Anarchy, and Global Extortion). 
*The James Bond spin-off animated series, &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot;, featured a clone of SPECTRE called &quot;S.C.U.M.&quot; (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), headed by a mysterious individual known as &quot;Scumlord&quot;.
*The animated series &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; featured a clone of SPECTRE called &quot;M.A.D.&quot; (Malevolent Agency of Destruction). Dr. Claw, the head of M.A.D., is also based on the villain Blofeld.
*The Mexican films &quot;Chabelo y Pepito vs los Monstruos&quot; (&quot;Chabelo and Pepito vs the Monsters&quot;) and &quot;Chabelo y Pepito Detectives&quot; feature a criminal organisation named S.P.E.C.T.R.U.M., which carries two plans to dominate the world. In &quot;Vs the Monsters&quot;, they extract uranium from a hill in the Mexican countryside, while in &quot;Detectives&quot; they sell toys that hypnotise children to make them work for them.
*The young adult book series &quot;Micro Adventure&quot; featured a shady organisation known as BRUTE (the Bureau for Revenge and Universal TErrorism). Its adversary was ACT (the American Counterintelligence Taskforce).
* An organisation known as SCORPIA (Sabotage, CORruPtion, Intelligence, and Assassination) appears in the &quot;Alex Rider&quot; novels and TV series as recurring antagonists whose various members clash with the title character Alex Rider. Near the end of the Cold War, several secret agents and law enforcers abandoned their loyalty to their countries, and became effectively criminals for hire. Their actions range from supplying biological weapons to engineering terrorism and performing assassinations. They are defeated in the novel &quot;Scorpia Rising&quot; and replaced in the novel &quot;Nightshade&quot; by an organisation reminiscent of the rebooted James Bond movie continuity&#x27;s &quot;Spectre&quot;.
*The TV series &quot;Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp&quot; featured a shadowy organisation called CHUMP (Unionized Hierarchy for Money, Power, and Control). It was opposed by APE (the Agency of Protection and Enforcement).
*The TV series &quot;Get Smart&quot; featured a SPECTRE-like organisation called KAOS.
*In 1983, a highly successful tabletop RPG called &quot;James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was released. With the novels and films as inspirations, the stories were adapted for players. Minor changes to plots and villains were made; for example, Wint and Kidd were freelance assassins working for SPECTRE. They in fact leased out services to other terrorist organisations and various crime syndicates. The most noted changes were to SPECTRE: Blofeld&#x27;s name was changed to Karl Ferenc Skorpios, and he was given a greyhound instead of a white cat; the organisation itself was renamed TAROT (Terrestrial Acquisition and Revenge via Orchestrated Turmoil), with the face cards representing various departments. This was due to the copyright issues referenced above. Victory Games worked with EON productions (the film producers) for the rights to Bond, and were told they were not allowed to negotiate with McClory for the rights to SPECTRE, hence the hasty renaming.
*The Disney animated series &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; featured a masked crimefighter who often worked with an agency called S.H.U.S.H. (expanded name unknown) against the forces of F.O.W.L. (the Fiendish organisation of World Larceny). These organisations also featured in &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot. In Season 3 of this show F.O.W.L. portrayed as the main villains of McDuck family, and its leader and founder, Bradford Buzzard, resembling leader of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
*The &quot;THUNDER Agents&quot; comic featured an enemy called S.P.I.D.E.R. (Secret People&#x27;s International Directorate for Extralegal Revenue).
*The &quot;Galaxy&quot; organisation features in &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; where &quot;Agent 0008&quot; tells Flint that Galaxy is &quot;bigger than SPECTRE&quot;.
*Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; features a terrorist organisation that the characters compare to SPECTRE once they learn that the terrorists are using chemical warfare similar to that in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.
*The video game &quot;Evil Genius&quot; places the player in command of a SPECTRE-like organisation, complete with a rocket-launching base inside a volcano. Additionally, one of the player&#x27;s choices of leader (Maximilian) is almost identical in appearance to SPECTRE&#x27;s leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (as he appeared in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;).
*In the British television series &quot;The Secret Show&quot; the evil organisation T.H.E.M. (The Horrible Evil Menace) is similar to SPECTRE.
*The CBBC series &quot;MI High&quot; features the criminal organisation &quot;SKUL&quot; (Super Kriminal Underground League), led by a man known only as &quot;The Grandmaster&quot; who is always seen stroking a white rabbit called General Flopsy.
*The Spanish comic book &quot;Mortadelo y Filemón&quot; features a parody of SPECTRE called &quot;ABUELA&quot; (Agentes Bélicos Ultramarinos Especialistas en Líos Aberrantes – warlike agents overseas specialists in aberrant messes).
*The &quot;Matt Helm&quot; films featured the Brotherhood of International Government and Order abbreviated as &quot;BIG O&quot;.
*Synthesiser company &quot;Waldorf&quot; has a synth named &quot;Blofeld&quot;. The computer based &quot;virtual editor&quot; for the Blofeld is called &quot;Spectre&quot;. One of Waldorf&#x27;s virtual synths is called &quot;Largo&quot;.
*In the &quot;SpyDogs&quot; cartoon, the evil leader of cats, Katastrophe, always appears fondling a rubber mouse.
*An evil organisation named STENCH (Society for the Total Extermination of Non-Conforming Humans) is featured in the film &quot;Carry On Spying&quot;.
*James Earl Ray, who committed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, used the alias Eric Starvo Galt during 1967, almost certainly a mixture of Ian Fleming and Ayn Rand. &quot;Ernst&quot; and &quot;Stavro&quot; are peculiar sounds and spellings to American ears and eyes, and he mentally transposed them into &quot;Eric&quot; and &quot;Starvo.&quot;
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot; appears an organisation called Globex Corporation directed by supervillain Hank Scorpio who successfully takes control of the East Coast.
*The Marvel Universe has the organisations HYDRA and A.I.M., which are both opposed by Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., and are sometimes also opposed by Captain America and the other Marvel heroes, while the DC Universe came up with the organisation H.I.V.E. as an analogue to SPECTRE.
*The Disney Channel&#x27;s TV series &quot;Kim Possible&quot; has the organisation WEE (Worldwide Evil Empire), which is opposed by GJ (Global Justice) and Kim Possible herself at times.
*In &quot;Spy Fox 2: &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot;&quot;, Spy Fox battles LeRoach – a member of the Society of Meaningless Evil, Larceny, Lying and Yelling (S.M.E.L.L.Y.).
*In Disney Channel&#x27;s TV series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz is occasionally seen as a member of the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness (L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.). Doofenshmirtz is not aware of the acronym until one of the other members points it out.
*In an episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s TV series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, BarnacleBoy turns to the dark side and teams up with Man Ray and The Dirty Bubble and they form an alliance called Every Villain is Lemons (E.V.I.L.).
*In the G.I. Joe toyline, cartoon and comic franchise, there exists an international terrorist organisation known as Cobra, which is similar to SPECTRE.
*&quot;Dr Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; features a supervillain organisation called the E.L.E. (Evil League of Evil), whose unseen leader Bad Horse is feared by all the members. The main protagonist of the film attempts to join the League, and eventually succeeds in doing so.
* The Japanese &quot;tokusatsu&quot; series &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; features a Nazi-connected terrorist group known as Shocker (eventually revealed as shorthand for Sacred Hegemony Of Cycle Kindred Evolutionary Realm in the film reboot &quot;Kamen Rider The First&quot;). Employing a vast range of genetically-modified agents known as &quot;modified humans&quot; and henchmen known as Shocker Combatmen, the organisation was headed by a mysterious figure known as &quot;The Great Leader&quot; (played by Goro Naya) who mainly contacted his agents via voice (who is eventually revealed to be a hooded figure with two forms – a Medusa-inspired humanoid with a head covered by snakes and a cyclops). Shocker was eventually disbanded after one too many defeats at the hands of the show&#x27;s protagonists and became known as Gel-Shocker after merging with an American criminal group known as Geldam. Gel-Shocker was eventually defeated as well, but subsequent entries of the franchise portrayed the Great Leader in various incarnations to lead various successor organisations, including Destron, Black Satan, the Delza Army, Neo-Shocker, the Badan Empire, Dai-Shocker (later reorganised into Super Shocker), and Space Shocker. The film &quot;Kamen Rider 1&quot; also features a splinter group known as Nova Shocker. The Great Leader also claims to have been the driving force behind two separate terrorist groups known as the Government of Darkness (also known as GOD) and Geddon, though it has never been confirmed.
* The novel &quot;19&quot; by Roger Hall, published in 1970, is about an American unauthorised counter-intelligence group. Several regular intelligence services, though unsure if this rogue group actually exists, nicknamed it &quot;19&quot; because that number repeatedly came up, by apparent coincidence, in their investigations of what might have been 19&#x27;s activities. When first told about 19 by a CIA friend, the narrator remarks that it sounds like SPECTRE gone straight (although it is misspelled &quot;SPECTER&quot; in &quot;19&quot;). Rumor credits 19 with major roles in exposing Kim Philby and Rudolf Abel, among other achievements.

<text>Marcus Agrippa Postumus (12 BC – AD 14), later named Agrippa Julius Caesar, was a grandson of Roman Emperor Augustus. He was the youngest child of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. Augustus initially considered Postumus as a potential successor and formally adopted him as his heir, before banishing Postumus from Rome in AD 6 on account of his (&quot;beastly nature&quot;). In effect, though not in law, the action cancelled his adoption and virtually assured Tiberius&#x27; emplacement as Augustus&#x27; sole heir. Postumus was ultimately executed by his own guards shortly after Augustus&#x27; death in AD 14.

Postumus was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, the first imperial family of the Roman Empire. His maternal grandparents were Augustus and his second wife, Scribonia. Postumus was also a maternal uncle of Emperor Caligula, who was the son of Postumus&#x27; sister Agrippina the Elder, as well as a great-uncle of Nero, the last Julio-Claudian emperor, whose mother, Agrippina the Younger, was Caligula&#x27;s sister.

==Name==
Postumus was initially named &quot;Marcus Agrippa&quot; in honour of his father, who died shortly before his birth and so the surname Postumus was added. After the death of his older brothers, Lucius and Gaius Caesar, Postumus was adopted by his maternal grandfather, Augustus. A &quot;lex curiata&quot; ratified his adoption from which Postumus assumed the filiation &quot;Augusti f.&quot;, meaning &quot;son of Augustus&quot;. Postumus was then legally the son of Augustus, as well as his biological grandson. As a consequence, Postumus was adopted into the Julia gens and took the name &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. His name was changed to Agrippa Julius Caesar.

==Early life and family==

Agrippa Postumus was born in Rome in 12 BC, approximately three months after his father, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, died in the summer. He was born into the equestrian . His father was one of Augustus&#x27; leading generals, and his mother, Julia the Elder, was the daughter of Augustus and his second wife, Scribonia. Postumus was the third son and last child of Agrippa and Julia; his older siblings were Gaius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Lucius Caesar and Agrippina the Elder. Both of his brothers, Gaius and Lucius, were adopted by Augustus after the birth of Lucius in 17 BC.

Before Gaius left Rome for Asia, Gaius and Lucius had been given the authority to consecrate the Temple of Mars Ultor (1 August 2BC), and they managed the games that were held to celebrate the Temple&#x27;s dedication. Postumus, still a student, participated in the (&quot;Trojan Games&quot;) with the rest of the equestrian youth. At these games, according to Cassius Dio, 260 lions were slaughtered in the Circus Maximus, there was gladiatorial combat and a naval battle between the &quot;Persians&quot; and the &quot;Athenians&quot; and 36 crocodiles were slaughtered in the Circus Flaminius.

===Adoption===
At first, Augustus opted not to adopt Postumus so that Agrippa would have at least one son to carry on his family name. However, the untimely deaths of Lucius (d. AD 2) and Gaius (d. AD 4) forced Augustus to adopt Postumus, his only remaining biological grandson, and Tiberius, Augustus&#x27; eldest stepson from his third wife, Livia, on 26 June AD 4 to secure the succession. He agreed to adopt Tiberius if Tiberius first adopted Germanicus. Upon his adoption into the , Postumus assumed the name &quot;Marcus Julius Caesar Agrippa Postumus&quot;. After the adoptions of AD 4, in the event of Augustus&#x27; death, the title of would pass first to Tiberius and then to Germanicus.

It was not intended that Postumus receive the emperorship; instead, he was meant to be the heir to Augustus&#x27; bloodline. He would receive Augustus&#x27; name, property, and bloodline but not the title of . Indeed, Postumus was not given any special schooling or treatment after his adoption. In AD 5, at the age of 17, he received the , and his name was added to the list of aristocratic youth eligible for training as military officers. That differed greatly from the honours received by his brothers, both of whom were inducted into the Roman Forum by Augustus himself to commemorate their adoptions, given the title (&quot;Leader of the Youth&quot;) and promised the consulship five years in advance, to be held when they reached 19.

==Exile==

In AD 6, an uprising began in the Roman province of Illyricum. Augustus sent Tiberius to crush the revolt with his army, and after a year of delayed results, he sent Germanicus in his capacity as quaestor to assist in bringing the war to a swift end. The reason, Dio says, that Germanicus was chosen over Postumus is because Postumus was of an &quot;illiberal nature&quot;.

Postumus was known for being brutish, insolent, stubborn and potentially violent. He possessed great physical strength and reportedly showed little interest in anything other than fishing. He resisted all efforts to improve his behavior, which forced Augustus to &quot;abdicate&quot; him from the in AD 6 and banish him to a villa at Surrentum, near Pompeii. As an abdicated adoptee (), he lost the Julian name and returned to the . The ancient historian Velleius Paterculus had this to say of the banishment:

The following year, in 7 AD, Augustus had the Senate make Postumus&#x27; banishment permanent and had him moved to Planasia (now Pianosa, Italy), a small island between Italy and Corsica. Augustus bolstered the natural inaccessibility of the rocky island by having an armed guard installed there. The Senate was ordered never to allow his release.

No consensus has emerged as to why Augustus banished Postumus. Tacitus suggests that Augustus&#x27; wife, Livia, had always disliked and shunned Postumus, as he stood in the way of her son Tiberius succeeding to power after Augustus since Postumus was a direct biological descendant of Augustus, unlike Tiberius. Some modern historians theorise that Postumus may have become involved in a conspiracy against Augustus. Postumus was held under intense security.

Postumus&#x27; sister Julia was banished around the same time (AD 8), and her husband, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, was executed for allegedly plotting a conspiracy against Augustus. There was later a conspiracy to rescue Julia and Postumus by Lucius Audasius and Asinius Epicadus. Audasius was an accused forger of advanced age, and Asinius was half-Illyrian. According to Suetonius, Audasius and Epicadus had planned to take Julia and Postumus by force to the armies. It is unclear what their exact plan was or even to which armies Suetonius was referring because the conspiracy was discovered early in its planning, possibly before they had even left Rome.

===Events of AD 14===

Augustus made no effort to contact Postumus until AD 14. In the summer of that year, Augustus left Rome, never to see the capital again. The main ancient sources of information about the period, Tacitus and Cassius Dio, suggest that Augustus left Rome in the company of only one trusted friend, the senator Paullus Fabius Maximus. They left for Planasia to pay Augustus&#x27; banished grandson a highly-controversial visit.

Fabius and then Augustus died on their return without revealing what they had been doing. Tacitus reports their visit to Planasia as a rumour although Dio reports it as fact. According to the historian Robin Lane Fox, the alleged visit has sometimes been dismissed by modern scholars. However, it has been shown that Augustus and Fabius were absent from Rome in mid-May of AD 14. Augustus&#x27; adopted grandson, Drusus the Younger, was then being admitted into the Arval Brethren, and an inscription (&quot;ILS&quot;, 5026) shows that both Augustus and Fabius voted to admit him into the priesthood.

There was much gossip over the outcome of their expedition. Tacitus recounts the rumour that Augustus had decided to reverse his decision and make Postumus his successor. In his account, Fabius indiscreetly told his wife what had occurred during the trip, and that cost him his life. Augustus&#x27; wife, Livia, too was said to have poisoned her husband to prevent Postumus from becoming the successor and thus supplanting her son Tiberius. While modern historians, including Fox, agree that such stories are highly unlikely, there is evidence that Augustus&#x27; journey was historical. &quot;It is the last act in Augustus&#x27; long marathon of finding and keeping an heir to the new Empire&quot;.

===Deaths of Augustus and Postumus===
Augustus died on 19 August AD 14. Despite being banished, Postumus had not legally been disinherited and so could claim a share in Augustus&#x27; inheritance. According to Augustus&#x27; will, sealed on 3 April AD 13, Tiberius would inherit two thirds of his estate and Livia one third. There is no mention of Postumus in the document. Tiberius gave the eulogy at Augustus&#x27; funeral and made a show of reluctantly accepting the title of .

At almost the same time as Augustus&#x27; death, Postumus was killed by the centurion Gaius Sallustius Crispus, the great-nephew and adopted son of the historian Sallust. When Crispus reported to Tiberius that &quot;his orders have been carried out&quot;, Tiberius threatened to bring the matter before the Senate and professed that he had given no such orders. Tiberius denied any involvement, argued that he had been &quot;en route&quot; to Illyricum when he was recalled to Rome, and later issued a statement that it was Augustus who had given the order that Agrippa Postumus not survive him. It is not clear if the killing was carried out before or after Tiberius became emperor.

==Legacy==
Two years later, there was an attempt by Postumus&#x27; former slave Clemens to impersonate him. Clemens was able to impersonate Postumus because people did not remember what Postumus looked like, but Dio also says there was a resemblance between them. The impersonation was carried out by the same slave who had set out in AD 14 to ship Postumus away, and the act was met with considerable success among the plebs.

According to the historian Erich S. Gruen, various contemporary sources state that Postumus was a &quot;vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character&quot;. The Roman historian Tacitus defended him, but his praise was slight: &quot;[He was] the young, physically tough, indeed brutish, Agrippa Postumus. Though devoid of every good quality, he had been involved in no scandal.&quot; It was common for ancient historians to portray Postumus as dim-witted and brutish. Velleius portrays Postumus as having had a deformed or perverse character, Dio records a propensity to violence (&quot;He had an impetuous temper...&quot;) and a devotion to &quot;servile pursuits&quot;, and both Tacitus and Suetonius describe him as fierce (&quot;). Contemporaries were reported to have described Postumus as wild (&quot;), and Suetonius is in agreement with Dio&#x27;s &quot;servile pursuits&quot; depiction. The historian Andrew Pettinger argues that the descriptions of Postumus reveal a moral inadequacy, not a mental disorder.

===In fiction===
Postumus is depicted in many works of art due to his relationship with the leading family of the early Roman Empire. They include:

*&quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1934), a novel by Robert Graves, presents Postumus in a positive light, as a boyhood friend of the narrator, Claudius. It creates a fictional incident in which Postumus is framed by Livia and her granddaughter Livilla for the attempted rape of Livilla, as a means of all but guaranteeing Tiberius&#x27; succession to the emperorship. Postumus is banished to Planasia but escapes execution when Augustus arranges for his impersonation by his freed slave Clemens, who is later executed by Crispus, unwittingly in Postumus&#x27; stead. The real Postumus spends time on the run, but is eventually captured and executed by Tiberius.
*In &quot;The Caesars&quot; (1968), a television series by Philip Mackie, Postumus was played by Derek Newark. Here Postumus is sentenced to death by Augustus, who decides to permanently remove his only remaining grandson as an obstacle to the succession of Tiberius.
*In &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), a television series by Jack Pulman based on Graves&#x27; novels, Postumus was played by John Castle. This retains the story from the novel of Postumus being framed for the assault on Livilla, and the later visit to Planasia by Augustus, but removes his fictional survival and shifts the events concerning his banishment to after the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. He is killed by Sejanus on Planasia after Augustus&#x27; death.
*In &quot;The Longest Exile&quot; (2024), the first in a historical fiction duology by Tana Rebellis which focuses primarily on the exile of Julia the Younger, Postumus is a secondary POV character with his own chapters, written about his time in exile on Planasia and the ongoing plots around him.

<doc id="88857" wikidata="Q183605" url="?curid=88857" title="Blood transfusion">
<text>Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood products into a person&#x27;s circulation intravenously. Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and other clotting factors. White blood cells are transfused only in very rare circumstances, since granulocyte transfusion has limited applications. Whole blood has come back into use in the trauma setting.

Red blood cells (RBC) contain hemoglobin and supply the cells of the body with oxygen. White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusions, but they are part of the immune system and also fight infections. Plasma is the &quot;yellowish&quot; liquid part of blood, which acts as a buffer and contains proteins and other important substances needed for the body&#x27;s overall health. Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogeneous. Because of this scientific misunderstanding, many patients died because of incompatible blood transferred to them.

== Medical uses ==

=== Red cell transfusion ===


Historically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 100g/L or hematocrit fell below 30%. Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that, at 70 to 80g/L, is now usually used, as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes. The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin due to iron deficiency, but are cardiovascularly stable, oral or parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. Other blood products are given where appropriate, e.g., fresh frozen plasma to treat clotting deficiencies and platelets to treat or prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients.

== Procedure ==
Before a blood transfusion is given, there are many steps taken to ensure quality of the blood products, compatibility, and safety to the recipient. In 2012, a national blood policy was in place in 70% of countries and 69% of countries had specific legislation that covers the safety and quality of blood transfusion.

=== Blood donation ===
The source of blood to be transfused can either be the potential recipient (autologous transfusion), or someone else (allogeneic or homologous transfusion). The latter is much more common than the former. Using another&#x27;s blood must first start with donation of blood. Blood is most commonly donated as whole blood obtained intravenously and mixed with an anticoagulant. In first-world countries, donations are usually anonymous to the recipient, but products in a blood bank are always individually traceable through the whole cycle of donation, testing, separation into components, storage, and administration to the recipient. This enables management and investigation of any suspected transfusion related disease transmission or transfusion reaction. Developing countries rely heavily on replacement and remunerated donors rather than voluntary nonremunerated donors due to concerns regarding donation- and transfusion-transmitted infection as well as local and cultural beliefs.

It is unclear whether applying alcohol swab alone or alcohol swab followed by antiseptic is able to reduce contamination of donor&#x27;s blood.

Studies show that the main motivators to blood donation tend to be prosocial (e.g., altruism, selflessness, charity), while the main deterrents include fear, distrust, or perceived racial discrimination in historic contexts.

=== Processing and testing ===
Donated blood is usually subjected to processing after it is collected, to make it suitable for use in specific patient populations. Collected blood is then separated into blood components by centrifugation: red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Plasma can be further processed to manufacture albumin protein, clotting factor concentrates, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen concentrate, and immunoglobulins (antibodies). Red cells, plasma and platelets can also be donated individually via a more complex process called apheresis.
* The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all donated blood be tested for transfusion-transmissible infections. These include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; (syphilis) and, where relevant, other infections that pose a risk to the safety of the blood supply, such as &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; (Chagas disease) and &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species (malaria). According to the WHO, 10 countries are not able to screen all donated blood for one or more of: HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or syphilis. One of the main reasons for this is because testing kits are not always available. However the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections is much higher in low income countries compared to middle and high income countries.
* All donated blood should also be tested for the ABO blood group system and Rh blood group system to ensure that the patient is receiving compatible blood.
* In addition, in some countries platelet products are also tested for bacterial infections due to its higher inclination for contamination due to storage at room temperature.
*Donors may be tested for cytomegalovirus (CMV) because of the risk of transmission to certain immunocompromised recipients, such as those with stem cell transplant or T cell diseases. However, testing is not universally mandated, because leukoreduced blood is generally considered safe from CMV transmission; also, most donors (and recipients) are seropositive for CMV, and are not actively viremic. CMV seropositive donors are still eligible to donate.
* Leukocyte reduction is the removal of white blood cells by filtration. Leukoreduced blood products are less likely to cause HLA alloimmunization (development of antibodies against specific blood types), febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, cytomegalovirus infection, and platelet-transfusion refractoriness.
* Pathogen reduction treatment that involves, for example, the addition of riboflavin with subsequent exposure to UV light has been shown to be effective in inactivating pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites and white blood cells) in blood products. By inactivating white blood cells in donated blood products, riboflavin and UV light treatment can also replace gamma-irradiation as a method to prevent graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD).

=== Compatibility testing ===
Before a recipient receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between donor and recipient blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient&#x27;s blood. Typing of recipient&#x27;s blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with donor blood. It takes about 45 minutes to complete (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for special requirements of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) and the history of the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other serological anomalies.
A positive screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation to determine if it is clinically significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and clinically significant alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+k+), heterozygous (K+k-) expression or no expression of various antigens (K−k−). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient&#x27;s serum is tested against the various donor cells using an indirect Coombs test. Based on the reactions of the patient&#x27;s serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence of one or more antibodies. Not all antibodies are clinically significant (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a clinically significant antibody it is vital that the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions.

If there is no antibody present, an immediate spin crossmatch may be performed where the recipient serum and donor rbc are incubated. In the immediate spin method, two drops of patient serum are tested against a drop of 3–5% suspension of donor cells in a test tube and spun in a serofuge. Agglutination or hemolysis (i.e., positive Coombs test) in the test tube is a positive reaction. If the crossmatch is positive, then further investigation is needed. Patients with no history of red cell antibodies may qualify for computer-assisted crossmatch, which does not involve combining patient serum with donor cells.

If an antibody is suspected, potential donor units must first be screened for the corresponding antigen by phenotyping them. Antigen negative units are then tested against the patient plasma using an antiglobulin/indirect crossmatch technique at 37 degrees Celsius to enhance reactivity and make the test easier to read.

In urgent cases where crossmatching cannot be completed, and the risk of dropping hemoglobin outweighs the risk of transfusing uncrossmatched blood, O-negative blood is used, followed by crossmatch as soon as possible. O-negative is also used for children and women of childbearing age. It is preferable for the laboratory to obtain a pre-transfusion sample in these cases so a type and screen can be performed to determine the actual blood group of the patient and to check for alloantibodies.

== Adverse effects ==
In the same way that the safety of pharmaceutical products is overseen by pharmacovigilance, the safety of blood and blood products is overseen by haemovigilance. This is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a system &quot;...to identify and prevent occurrence or recurrence of transfusion related unwanted events, to increase the safety, efficacy and efficiency of blood transfusion, covering all activities of the transfusion chain from donor to recipient.&quot; The system should include monitoring, identification, reporting, investigation and analysis of adverse events, near-misses, and reactions related to transfusion and manufacturing. In the UK this data is collected by an independent organisation called SHOT (Serious Hazards Of Transfusion). Haemovigilance systems have been established in many countries with the objective of ensuring the safety of blood for transfusion, but their organisational set-up and operating principles can vary.

Transfusions of blood products are associated with several complications, many of which can be grouped as immunological or infectious. There is controversy on potential quality degradation during storage.

=== Immunologic reaction ===
* Acute hemolytic reactions are defined according to Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) as &quot;fever and other symptoms/signs of haemolysis within 24 hours of transfusion; confirmed by one or more of the following: a fall of Hb, rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), positive crossmatch&quot; This is due to destruction of donor red blood cells by preformed recipient antibodies. Most often this occurs because of clerical errors or improper ABO blood typing and crossmatching resulting in a mismatch in ABO blood type between the donor and the recipient. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, hemorrhage, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and rapid drop in blood pressure. When suspected, transfusion should be stopped immediately, and blood sent for tests to evaluate for presence of hemolysis. Treatment is supportive. Kidney injury may occur because of the effects of the hemolytic reaction (pigment nephropathy). The severity of the transfusion reaction is depended upon amount of donor&#x27;s antigen transfused, nature of the donor&#x27;s antigens, the nature and the amount of recipient antibodies.
* Delayed hemolytic reactions occur more than 24 hours after a transfusion. They usually occur within 28 days of a transfusion. They can be due to either a low level of antibodies present prior to the start of the transfusion, which are not detectable on pre-transfusion testing; or development of a new antibody against an antigen in the transfused blood. Therefore, delayed haemolytic reaction does not manifest until after 24 hours when enough antibodies are available to cause a reaction. The red blood cells are removed by macrophages from the blood circulation into liver and spleen to be destroyed, which leads to extravascular haemolysis. This process usually mediated by anti-Rh and anti-Kidd antibodies. However, this type of transfusion reaction is less severe when compared to acute haemolytic transfusion reaction.
* Febrile nonhemolytic reactions are, along with allergic transfusion reactions, the most common type of blood transfusion reaction and occur because of the release of inflammatory chemical signals released by white blood cells in stored donor blood or attack on donor&#x27;s white blood cells by recipient&#x27;s antibodies. This type of reaction occurs in about 7% of transfusions. Fever is generally short lived and is treated with antipyretics, and transfusions may be finished as long as an acute hemolytic reaction is excluded. This is a reason for the now-widespread use of leukoreduction — the filtration of donor white cells from red cell product units.
* Allergic transfusion reactions are caused by IgE anti-allergen antibodies. When antibodies are bound to its antigens, histamine is released from mast cells and basophils. Either IgE antibodies from the donor&#x27;s or recipient&#x27;s side can cause the allergic reaction. It is more common in patients who have allergic conditions such as hay fever. Patient may feel itchy or having hives but the symptoms are usually mild and can be controlled by stopping the transfusion and giving antihistamines.
* Anaphylactic reactions are rare life-threatening allergic conditions caused by IgA anti-plasma protein antibodies. For patients who have selective immunoglobulin A deficiency, the reaction is presumed to be caused by IgA antibodies in the donor&#x27;s plasma. The patient may present with symptoms of fever, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and circulatory shock. Urgent treatment with epinephrine is needed.
* Post-transfusion purpura is an extremely rare complication that occurs after blood product transfusion and is associated with the presence of antibodies in the patient&#x27;s blood directed against both the donor&#x27;s and recipient&#x27;s platelets HPA (human platelet antigen). Recipients who lack this protein develop sensitization to this protein from prior transfusions or previous pregnancies, can develop thrombocytopenia, bleeding into the skin, and can display purplish discolouration of skin which is known as purpura. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is treatment of choice.
* Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a syndrome that is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops during or within 6 hours of transfusion of a plasma-containing blood product. Fever, hypotension, shortness of breath, and tachycardia often occurs in this type of reaction. For a definitive diagnosis to be made, symptoms must occur within 6 hours of transfusion, hypoxemia must be present, there must be radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates and there must be no evidence of left atrial hypertension (fluid overload). It occurs in 15% of the transfused patient with mortality rate of 5 to 10%. Recipient risk factors includes: end-stage liver disease, sepsis, haematological malignancies, sepsis, and ventilated patients. Antibodies to human neutrophil antigens (HNA) and human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have been associated with this type of transfusion reaction. Donor&#x27;s antibodies interacting with antigen positive recipient tissue result in release of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in pulmonary capillary leakage. The treatment is supportive.
* Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) is a common, yet underdiagnosed, reaction to blood product transfusion consisting of the new onset or exacerbation of three of the following within 6 hours of cessation of transfusion: acute respiratory distress, elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated central venous pressure (CVP), evidence of left heart failure, evidence of positive fluid balance, and/or radiographic evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Patients with congestive heart failure or kidney disease are more susceptible to volume overload. For especially vulnerable patients, a standard RBC unit could be split by sterile technique in the blood bank and administered over 8 hours instead of the standard 4 hours. Plasma transfusion is especially prone to causing TACO because large volumes are usually required to give any therapeutic benefit.
* Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease frequently occurs in immunodeficient patients where recipient&#x27;s body failed to eliminate donor&#x27;s T cells. Instead, donor&#x27;s T cells attack the recipient&#x27;s cells. It occurs one week after transfusion. Fever, rash, diarrhoea are often associated with this type of transfusion reaction. Mortality rate is high, with 89.7% of the patients dead after 24 days. Immunosuppressive treatment is the most common way of treatment. Irradiation and leukoreduction of blood products is necessary for high risk patients to prevent T cells from attacking recipient cells.

=== Infection ===

The use of greater amount of red blood cells has been suggested to increase the risk of infections, not only transfusion-transmitted infections, but also due to a phenomenon known as transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM). TRIM may be caused by macrophages and their byproducts. In those who were given red blood cells only with significant anemia (&quot;restrictive&quot; strategy), serious infection rates were 10.6% while in those who were given red blood at milder levels of anemia (&quot;liberal&quot; strategy), serious infection rates were 12.7%.

On rare occasions, blood products are contaminated with bacteria. This can result in a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, , at about 1 in 2,500 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 2,000,000 red blood cell transfusions. Blood product contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other blood products is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if that means more than 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor&#x27;s blood, donor&#x27;s skin, phlebotomist&#x27;s skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories to reduce the risk of contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the donor blood.

Since the advent of HIV testing of donor blood in the mid/later 1980s, ex. 1985&#x27;s ELISA, the transmission of HIV during transfusion has dropped dramatically. Prior testing of donor blood only included testing for antibodies to HIV. However, because of latent infection (the &quot;window period&quot; in which an individual is infectious, but has not had time to develop antibodies) many cases of HIV seropositive blood were missed. The development of a nucleic acid test for the HIV-1 RNA has dramatically lowered the rate of donor blood seropositivity to about 1 in 3 million units. As transmittance of HIV does not necessarily mean HIV infection, the latter could still occur at an even lower rate.

The transmission of hepatitis C via transfusion currently stands at a rate of about 1 in 2 million units. As with HIV, this low rate has been attributed to the ability to screen for both antibodies as well as viral RNA nucleic acid testing in donor blood.

Other rare transmissible infections include hepatitis B, syphilis, Chagas disease, cytomegalovirus infections (in immunocompromised recipients), HTLV, and Babesia.

===Comparison table===
=== Inefficacy ===
Transfusion inefficacy or insufficient efficacy of a given unit(s) of blood product, while not itself a &quot;complication&quot; &quot;per se&quot;, can nonetheless indirectly lead to complications – in addition to causing a transfusion to fully or partly fail to achieve its clinical purpose. This can be especially significant for certain patient groups such as critical-care or neonatals.

For red blood cells (RBC), by far the most commonly transfused product, poor transfusion efficacy can result from units damaged by the so-called storage lesion — a range of biochemical and biomechanical changes that occur during storage. With red cells, this can decrease viability and ability for tissue oxygenation. Although some of the biochemical changes are reversible after the blood is transfused, the biomechanical changes are less so, and rejuvenation products are not yet able to adequately reverse this phenomenon. There has been controversy about whether a given product unit&#x27;s age is a factor in transfusion efficacy, specifically about whether &quot;older&quot; blood directly or indirectly increases risks of complications. Studies have not been consistent on answering this question, with some showing that older blood is indeed less effective but with others showing no such difference; these developments are being closely followed by hospital blood bankers — who are the physicians, typically pathologists, who collect and manage inventories of transfusable blood units.

Certain regulatory measures are in place to minimize RBC storage lesion — including a maximum shelf life (currently 42 days), a maximum auto-hemolysis threshold (currently 1% in the US, 0.8% in Europe), and a minimum level of post-transfusion RBC survival &quot;in vivo&quot; (currently 75% after 24 hours). However, all of these criteria are applied in a universal manner that does not account for differences among units of product. For example, testing for the post-transfusion RBC survival &quot;in vivo&quot; is done on a sample of healthy volunteers, and then compliance is presumed for all RBC units based on universal (GMP) processing standards (RBC survival by itself does not guarantee efficacy, but it is a necessary prerequisite for cell function, and hence serves as a regulatory proxy). Opinions vary as to the &quot;best&quot; way to determine transfusion efficacy in a patient &quot;in vivo&quot;. In general, there are not yet any &quot;in vitro&quot; tests to assess quality or predict efficacy for specific units of RBC blood product prior to their transfusion, though there is exploration of potentially relevant tests based on RBC membrane properties such as erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte fragility (mechanical).

Physicians have adopted a so-called &quot;restrictive protocol&quot; — whereby transfusion is held to a minimum — in part because of the noted uncertainties surrounding storage lesion, in addition to the very high direct and indirect costs of transfusions. However, the restrictive protocol is not an option with some especially vulnerable patients who may require the best possible efforts to rapidly restore tissue oxygenation.

Although transfusions of platelets are far less numerous (relative to RBC), platelet storage lesion and resulting efficacy loss is also a concern.

=== Other ===
* A relationship between intra-operative blood transfusion and cancer recurrence has been observed in colorectal cancer. In lung cancer intra-operative blood transfusion has been associated with earlier recurrence of cancer, worse survival rates and poorer outcomes after lung resection. Suppression of the immune system by blood transfusion has been implicated as playing a role in more than 10 different cancer types, through mechanisms involving the innate and adaptive immune system. Five major mechanisms for this include the lymphocyte-T set, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer cells (NKCs), and dendritic cells (DCs). Blood transfusion may modulate the activity of antitumor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+/CTL), temporal response of Tregs, and the STAT3 signaling pathway. The role of the antitumor immune response in cancer therapeutics was explored historically through the use of bacteria to enhance the antitumor immune response and more recently in cellular Immunotherapy. However, the impact of transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM) on cancer progression has not been definitively established and requires further study.
*In retrospective studies, blood transfusion has been associated with worse outcomes after cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC. However, correlation does not prove causation, and transfused patients often have more complicated surgeries and more underlying cardiopulmonary disease compared to untransfused patients; conclusions should be based on prospective randomized controlled trials.
* Hypothermia can occur with transfusions with large quantities of blood products which normally are stored at cold temperatures. Core body temperature can go down as low as 32 °C and can produce physiologic disturbances. Prevention should be done with warming the blood to ambient temperature prior to transfusions. Blood warming devices are available to avoid the hemolysis that would occur from unsafe practices such as microwaving.
* Transfusions with large amounts of red blood cells, whether due to severe hemorrhaging and/or transfusion inefficacy (see above), can lead to an inclination for bleeding. The mechanism is thought to be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, along with dilution of recipient platelets and coagulation factors. Close monitoring and transfusions with platelets and plasma is indicated when necessary. Progressive hemorrhagic injury (PHI) in traumatic brain injured patients may be worsened by liberal transfusion strategies.
* Metabolic alkalosis can occur with massive blood transfusions because of the breakdown of citrate stored in blood into bicarbonate. However, acidemia is common in massively transfused patients, and acid-base balance is affected by complex factors.
* Hypocalcemia can also occur with massive blood transfusions because of the complex of citrate with serum calcium. Calcium levels below 0.9 mmol/L should be treated.
* Blood doping has been used by athletes to increase physical stamina. A lack of knowledge and insufficient experience can turn a blood transfusion into a dangerous event. For example, improper storage involving freezing and thawing, or minor antigen incompatibility, could lead to hemolysis.

== Frequency of use ==
Globally around 85 million units of red blood cells are transfused in a given year. The global demand is much higher and there is an unmet need for safe blood for transfusion in many low- and middle-income countries.

In the United States, blood transfusions were performed nearly 3 million times during hospitalizations in 2011, making it the most common procedure performed. The rate of hospitalizations with a blood transfusion nearly doubled from 1997, from a rate of 40 stays to 95 stays per 10,000 population. It was the most common procedure performed for patients 45 years of age and older in 2011, and among the top five most common for patients between the ages of 1 and 44 years.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Changes in medicine have eliminated the need for millions of blood transfusions, which is good news for patients getting procedures like coronary bypasses and other procedures that once required a lot of blood.&quot; And, &quot;Blood bank revenue is falling, and the decline may reach $1.5 billion a year this year [2014] from a high of $5 billion in 2008.&quot; In 2014, the Red Cross was predicting job losses as high as 12,000 within the next three to five years, roughly a quarter of the total in the industry. As of 2019, the trend of declining transfusions appeared to be stabilizing, with 10,852,000 RBC units transfused in the United States.

== History ==
Beginning with William Harvey&#x27;s experiments on the circulation of blood, recorded research into blood transfusion began in the 17th century, with successful experiments in transfusion between animals. However, successive attempts by physicians to transfuse animal blood into humans gave variable, often fatal, results.

Pope Innocent VIII is sometimes said to have been given &quot;the world&#x27;s first blood transfusion&quot; by his Italian-Jewish physician Giacomo di San Genesio, who had him drink (by mouth) the blood of three 10-year-old boys. The boys consequently died, as did the Pope himself. However, the evidence for this story is unreliable and considered a possible anti-Jewish blood libel.

=== Early attempts ===
==== Animal blood ====

Working at the Royal Society in the 1660s, the physician Richard Lower began examining the effects of changes in blood volume on circulatory function and developed methods for cross-circulatory study in animals, obviating clotting by closed arteriovenous connections. The new instruments he was able to devise enabled him to perform the first reliably documented successful transfusion of blood in front of his distinguished colleagues from the Royal Society.

According to Lower&#x27;s account, &quot;...towards the end of February 1665 [I] selected one dog of medium size, opened its jugular vein, and drew off blood, until its strength was nearly gone. Then, to make up for the great loss of this dog by the blood of a second, I introduced blood from the cervical artery of a fairly large mastiff, which had been fastened alongside the first, until this latter animal showed ... it was overfilled ... by the inflowing blood.&quot; After he &quot;sewed up the jugular veins&quot;, the animal recovered &quot;with no sign of discomfort or of displeasure&quot;.

Lower had performed the first blood transfusion between animals. He was then &quot;requested by the Honorable [Robert] Boyle ... to acquaint the Royal Society with the procedure for the whole experiment&quot;, which he did in December 1665 in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;.

The first blood transfusion from animal to human was administered by Dr. Jean-Baptiste Denys, eminent physician to King Louis XIV of France, on June 15, 1667. He transfused the blood of a sheep into a 15-year-old boy, who survived the transfusion. Denys performed another transfusion into a labourer, who also survived. Both instances were likely due to the small amount of blood that was actually transfused into these people. This allowed them to withstand the allergic reaction.

Denys&#x27;s third patient to undergo a blood transfusion was Swedish Baron Gustaf Bonde. He received two transfusions. After the second transfusion Bonde died. In the winter of 1667, Denys performed several transfusions on Antoine Mauroy with calf&#x27;s blood. On the third account Mauroy died.

Six months later in London, Lower performed the first human transfusion of animal blood in Britain, where he &quot;superintended the introduction in [a patient&#x27;s] arm at various times of some ounces of sheep&#x27;s blood at a meeting of the Royal Society, and without any inconvenience to him.&quot; The recipient was Arthur Coga, &quot;the subject of a harmless form of insanity.&quot; Sheep&#x27;s blood was used because of speculation about the value of blood exchange between species; it had been suggested that blood from a gentle lamb might quiet the tempestuous spirit of an agitated person and that the shy might be made outgoing by blood from more sociable creatures. Coga received 20 shillings () to participate in the experiment.

Lower went on to pioneer new devices for the precise control of blood flow and the transfusion of blood; his designs were substantially the same as modern syringes and catheters. Shortly after, Lower moved to London, where his growing practice soon led him to abandon research.

These early experiments with animal blood provoked a heated controversy in Britain and France. Finally, in 1668, the Royal Society and the French government both banned the procedure. The Vatican condemned these experiments in 1670. Blood transfusions fell into obscurity for the next 150 years.

==== Human blood ====

The science of blood transfusion dates to the first decade of the 20th century, with the discovery of distinct blood types leading to the practice of mixing some blood from the donor and the receiver before the transfusion (an early form of cross-matching).

In the early 19th century, British obstetrician Dr. James Blundell made efforts to treat hemorrhage by transfusion of human blood using a syringe. In 1818, after experiments with animals, he performed the first successful transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient&#x27;s husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of blood from his arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood. He made a substantial amount of money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).

In 1840, at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London, Samuel Armstrong Lane, aided by Blundell, performed the first successful whole blood transfusion to treat haemophilia.

However, early transfusions were risky and many resulted in the death of the patient. By the late 19th century, blood transfusion was regarded as a risky and dubious procedure, and was largely shunned by the medical establishment.

Work to emulate James Blundell continued in Edinburgh. In 1845 the &quot;Edinburgh Journal&quot; described the successful transfusion of blood to a woman with severe uterine bleeding. Subsequent transfusions were successful with patients of Professor James Young Simpson, after whom the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh was named.

Various isolated reports of successful transfusions emerged towards the end of the 19th century. The largest series of early successful transfusions took place at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary between 1885 and 1892. Edinburgh later became the home of the first blood donation and blood transfusion services.

===20th century===

Only in 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered three human blood groups (O, A, and B), did blood transfusion achieve a scientific basis and become safer.

Landsteiner discovered that adverse effects arise from mixing blood from two incompatible individuals. He found that mixing incompatible types triggers an immune response and the red blood-cells clump. The immunological reaction occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood-cells. The destruction of red blood cells releases free hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can have fatal consequences. Landsteiner&#x27;s work made it possible to determine blood group and allowed blood transfusions to take place much more safely. For his discovery he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1930; many other blood groups have been discovered since.

George Washington Crile is credited with performing the first surgery using a direct blood transfusion in 1906 at St. Alexis Hospital in Cleveland while a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University.

Jan Janský also discovered the human blood groups; in 1907 he classified blood into four groups: I, II, III, IV. His nomenclature is still used in Russia and in states of the former USSR, in which blood types O, A, B, and AB are respectively designated I, II, III, and IV.

Dr. William Lorenzo Moss&#x27;s (1876–1957) Moss-blood typing technique of 1910 was widely used until World War II.

William Stewart Halsted, M.D. (1852–1922), an American surgeon, performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. He found her moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew his own blood, transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.

==== Blood banks in WWI ====

While the first transfusions had to be made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London in the late-19th century. His attempts, using phosphate of soda, however, proved unsuccessful.

The Belgian doctor Albert Hustin performed the first non-direct transfusion on March 27, 1914, though this involved a diluted solution of blood. The Argentine doctor Luis Agote used a much less diluted solution in November of the same year. Both used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant.

The First World War (1914–1918) acted as a catalyst for the rapid development of blood banks and transfusion techniques. Francis Peyton Rous and Joseph R. Turner at the Rockefeller University (then The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research) made the first important discoveries that blood typing was necessary to avoid blood clumping (coagulation) and blood samples could be preserved using chemical treatment. Their first report in March 1915 showed that gelatine, agar, blood serum extracts, starch and beef albumin proved to be useless preservatives.

However, building on the same experiment, they discovered that a mixture sodium citrate and glucose (dextrose) solution was a perfect preservative; as they reported in February issue of the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine,&quot; the preserved bloods were just like fresh bloods and that they &quot;function excellently when reintroduced into the body.&quot; Blood could be preserved for up to four weeks. An accompanying experiment using citrate-saccharose (sucrose) mixture was also a success which could maintain blood cells for two weeks. This use of citrate and sugars, sometimes known as Rous-Turner solution, was the foundation for the development of blood banks and improvement of transfusion method.

Another discovery of Rous and Turner was the most critical step in the safety of blood transfusion. Rous was well aware that Landsteiner&#x27;s concept of blood types had not yet find practical value, as he remarked: &quot;The fate of Landsteiner&#x27;s effort to call attention to the practical bearing of the group differences in human bloods provides an exquisite instance of knowledge marking time on technique. Transfusion was still not done because (until at least 1915), the risk of clotting was too great.&quot; In June 1915, they made a crucial report in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; that agglutination could be avoided if the blood samples of the donor and recipient were tested before. Which they called a rapid and simple method for testing blood compatibility, sodium citrate was used to dilute the blood samples, and after mixing the recipient&#x27;s and donor&#x27;s blood in 9:1 and 1:1 parts, blood would either clump or remain watery after 15 minutes. According to their advice, blood without clumping &quot;should always be chosen if possible.&quot;

Canadian doctor and Lieutenant Lawrence Bruce Robertson became instrumental in persuading the Royal Army Medical Corps to adopt the use of blood transfusion at the Casualty Clearing Stations for the wounded. In October 1915, Robertson performed his first wartime transfusion with a syringe to a patient who had multiple shrapnel wounds. He followed this up with four subsequent transfusions in the following months, and his success was reported to Sir Walter Morley Fletcher, director of the Medical Research Committee.
Robertson published his findings in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1916 and, with the help of a few like-minded individuals (including the eminent physician Edward William Archibald), was able to persuade the British authorities of the merits of blood transfusion. Robertson went on to establish the first blood-transfusion apparatus at a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front in the spring of 1917. Robertson did not test crossmatching so that one died of hemolysis in his 1916 transfusion, and three in 1917.

Oswald Hope Robertson, a medical researcher and U.S. Army officer, was attached to the RAMC in 1917, where he became instrumental in establishing the first blood banks in preparation for the anticipated Third Battle of Ypres. He used sodium citrate as the anticoagulant; blood was extracted from punctures in the vein and was stored in bottles at British and American Casualty Clearing Stations along the Front. Robertson also experimented with preserving separated red blood cells in iced bottles. Geoffrey Keynes, a British surgeon, developed a portable machine that could store blood to enable transfusions to be carried out more easily.

The secretary of the British Red Cross, Percy Lane Oliver, established the world&#x27;s first blood-donor service in 1921. In that year, Oliver was contacted by King&#x27;s College Hospital, where they were in urgent need of a blood donor.
 After providing a donor, Oliver set about organizing a system for the voluntary registration of blood donors at clinics around London, with Sir Geoffrey Keynes appointed as a medical adviser. Volunteers were subjected to a series of physical tests to establish their blood group. The London Blood Transfusion Service was free of charge and expanded rapidly in its first few years of operation. By 1925 it was providing services for almost 500 patients; it was incorporated into the structure of the British Red Cross in 1926. Similar systems developed in other cities, including Sheffield, Manchester and Norwich, and the service&#x27;s work began to attract international attention. France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Australia and Japan established similar services.

Alexander Bogdanov founded an academic institution devoted to the science of blood transfusion in Moscow in 1925. Bogdanov was motivated, at least in part, by a search for eternal youth, and remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms after receiving 11 transfusions of whole blood. Bogdanov died in 1928 as a result of one of his experiments, when the blood of a student with malaria and tuberculosis was given to him in a transfusion. Following Bogdanov&#x27;s lead, Vladimir Shamov and Sergei Yudin in the USSR pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood from recently deceased donors. Yudin performed such a transfusion successfully for the first time on March 23, 1930, and reported his first seven clinical transfusions with cadaveric blood at the Fourth Congress of Ukrainian Surgeons at Kharkiv in September. However, this method was never used widely, even in the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union was the first to establish a network of facilities to collect and store blood for use in transfusions at hospitals.
Frederic Durán-Jordà established one of the earliest blood banks during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Duran joined the Transfusion Service at the Barcelona Hospital at the start of the conflict, but the hospital was soon overwhelmed by the demand for blood and the paucity of available donors. With support from the Department of Health of the Spanish Republican Army, Duran established a blood bank for the use of wounded soldiers and civilians. The 300–400 mL of extracted blood was mixed with 10% citrate solution in a modified Duran Erlenmeyer flask. The blood was stored in a sterile glass enclosed under pressure at 2 °C. During 30 months of work, the Transfusion Service of Barcelona registered almost 30,000 donors, and processed 9,000 liters of blood.

In 1937 Bernard Fantus, director of therapeutics at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, established the first hospital blood-bank in the United States. In setting up a hospital laboratory that preserved, refrigerated and stored donor blood, Fantus originated the term &quot;blood bank&quot;. Within a few years, hospital and community blood-banks were established across the United States. Until the middle of World War II, the newly established US blood banks rejected African-American donors. During the war, Black people were allowed to donate blood, but the donated blood was labeled as being suitable only for transfusion into another person from the same race.

Frederic Durán-Jordà fled to Britain in 1938 and worked with Dr Janet Vaughan at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital to establish a system of national blood banks in London. With the outbreak of war appearing imminent in 1938, the War Office created the Army Blood Supply Depot (ABSD) in Bristol, headed by Lionel Whitby and in control of four large blood-depots around the country. British policy through the war was to supply military personnel with blood from centralized depots, in contrast to the approach taken by the Americans and Germans where troops at the front were bled to provide required blood. The British method proved more successful in adequately meeting all requirements, and over 700,000 donors were bled over the course of the war. This system evolved into the National Blood Transfusion Service established in 1946, the first national service to be implemented.
Stories tell of Nazis in Eastern Europe during World War II using captive children as repeated involuntary blood-donors.

==== Medical advances ====

A blood-collection program was initiated in the US in 1940 and Edwin Cohn pioneered the process of blood fractionation. He worked out the techniques for isolating the serum albumin fraction of blood plasma, which is essential for maintaining the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels, preventing their collapse.

Gordon R. Ward, writing in the correspondence columns of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, proposed the use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes as early as 1918. At the onset of World War II, liquid plasma was used in Britain. A large project, known as &quot;Blood for Britain&quot;, began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. A freeze-dried plasma package was developed by the Surgeons General of the Army and Navy, working with the National Research Council, which reduced breakage and made transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.
The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 mL bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours. Dr. Charles R. Drew was appointed medical supervisor, and he was able to transform the test-tube methods into the first successful technique for mass production.

Another important breakthrough came in 1937–40 when Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943), Alex Wiener, Philip Levine, and R.E. Stetson discovered the Rhesus blood group system, which was found to be the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions up to that time. Three years later, the introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acid–citrate–dextrose (ACD) solution, which reduced the volume of anticoagulant, permitted transfusions of greater volumes of blood and allowed longer-term storage.

Carl Walter and W.P. Murphy Jr. introduced the plastic bag for blood collection in 1950. Replacing breakable glass bottles with durable plastic bags made from PVC allowed for the evolution of a collection system capable of safe and easy preparation of multiple blood components from a single unit of whole blood.

In the field of cancer surgery, the replacement of massive blood-loss became a major problem. The cardiac-arrest rate was high. In 1963 C. Paul Boyan and William S. Howland discovered that the temperature of the blood and the rate of infusion greatly affected survival rates, and introduced blood warming to surgery.

Further extending the shelf-life of stored blood up to 42 days was an anticoagulant preservative, CPDA-1, introduced in 1979, which increased the blood supply and facilitated resource-sharing among blood banks.

 about 15 million units of blood products were transfused per year in the United States. By 2013 the number had declined to about 11 million units, because of the shift towards laparoscopic surgery and other surgical advances and studies that have shown that many transfusions were unnecessary. For example, the standard of care reduced the amount of blood transfused in one case from 750 to 200 mL. In 2019, 10,852,000 RBC units, 2,243,000 platelet units, and 2,285,000 plasma units were transfused in the United States.

== Special populations ==

=== Neonate ===
To ensure the safety of blood transfusion to pediatric patients, hospitals are taking additional precautions to avoid infection and prefer to use pediatric blood units that are guaranteed &quot;safe&quot; from &quot;Cytomegalovirus&quot;. Some guidelines have recommended the provision of CMV-negative blood components and not simply leukoreduced components for newborns or low birthweight infants in whom the immune system is not fully developed, but practice varies. These requirements place additional restrictions on blood donors who can donate for neonatal use, which may be impractical given the rarity of CMV seronegative donors and the preference for fresh units.

Neonatal transfusions typically fall into one of two categories:
* &quot;Top-up&quot; transfusions, to replace losses due to investigational losses and correction of anemia.
* Exchange (or partial exchange) transfusions are done for removal of bilirubin, removal of antibodies and replacement of red cells (e.g., for anemia secondary to thalassemias and other hemoglobinopathies or fetal erythroblastosis).

=== Significant blood loss ===
A &quot;massive transfusion protocol&quot; is used when significant blood loss is present such as in major trauma, when more than ten units of blood are needed. Packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets are generally administered. Typical ratios of fresh frozen plasma, platelets and packed red blood cells are between 1:1:1 and 1:1:2.

In some locations, blood has begun to be administered &quot;pre-hospital&quot; in an effort to reduce preventable deaths from significant blood loss. Earlier analyses suggested that in the US, up to 31,000 patients per year bleed to death that otherwise could have survived if pre-hospital transfusions were widely available. For example, when a mother experiences severe blood loss during pregnancy, ambulances are able to arrive with blood stored in portable, FDA listed blood refrigerators, similar to those found in blood banks. Once the infusion is given on scene, the patient and the ambulance have more time to get to a hospital for surgery and additional infusions if needed. This could be critical in rural areas or sprawling cities where patients can be far from a major hospital and the local emergency medical team may need to use blood infusions to keep that patient alive during transport. Larger studies pointed to improvements in 24-hour mortality with pre-hospital plasma and RBC transfusions, but no difference in 30-day or long-term mortality.

=== Unknown blood type ===
Because blood type O negative is compatible with anyone, it is often overused and in short supply. According to the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies, the use of this blood should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, as nothing else is compatible with them, and women who might be pregnant and for whom it would be impossible to do blood group testing before giving them emergency treatment. Whenever possible, the AABB recommends that O negative blood be conserved by using blood type testing to identify a less scarce alternative.

=== Religious objections ===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses may object to blood transfusions because of their belief that blood is sacred.

=== Personal objections ===
Sometimes people refuse blood transfusions because of fears about the safety of the blood supply. Generally speaking, the rules of informed consent allow mentally competent adults to refuse blood transfusions even when their objections are based on misinformation or prejudice and even when their refusal may result in serious and permanent harm, including death. For example, since COVID-19 vaccines became available, some people in the US have refused blood transfusions because the donor might have been vaccinated, and they fear that this would cause secondhand harm to them. This choice is based on false beliefs, but a mentally competent adult&#x27;s choices are normally respected. However, if doctor&#x27;s opinions are that parents and guardians are making harmful choices about children, they can be overruled (in some jurisdictions) using legal arguments based on the harm principle; in this case if doctors believe that refusing the blood transfusion would put the child at risk of serious injury or death. Blood banks do not collect information that is irrelevant to the transfusion process, including the donors&#x27; race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, COVID-19 vaccination status, etc., so selecting blood units based on the individual&#x27;s personal objections is not practical.

== Research into alternatives ==

Although there are clinical situations where transfusion with red blood cells is the only clinically appropriate option, clinicians look at whether alternatives are feasible. This can be due to several reasons, such as patient safety, economic burden or scarcity of blood. Guidelines recommend blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia. In stable patients with iron deficiency anemia, oral or parenteral iron is recommended.

Thus far, there are no FDA-approved &quot;oxygen-carrying&quot; blood substitutes, which is the typical objective of a blood (RBC) transfusion. Non-blood &quot;volume expanders&quot; are available for cases where only volume restoration is required, but a substance with oxygen-carrying capacity would help doctors and surgeons avoid the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, address the chronic blood donor shortage, and address the concerns of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and others who have religious objections to receiving transfused blood.

The research in this area is ongoing. A number of blood substitutes have been explored, but thus far they all have serious limitations. Most attempts to find a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa and has been used in the United States on a case-by-case basis through the emergency Investigational New Drug (IND) process.

== Veterinary use ==
Veterinarians also administer transfusions to other animals. Various species require different levels of testing to ensure a compatible match. For example, cats have 3 known blood types, cattle have 11, dogs have at least 13, pigs have 16, and horses over 30. However, in many species (especially horses and dogs), cross matching is not required before the &quot;first&quot; transfusion, as antibodies against non-self cell surface antigens are not expressed constitutively — i.e. the animal has to be sensitized before it will mount an immune response against the transfused blood.

The rare and experimental practice of inter-species blood transfusions (xenotransfusion) is a form of xenograft.

<text>Alabama is an American country music band formed in Fort Payne, Alabama, in 1969. The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass, backing vocals). They were soon joined by another cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, and keyboards). First operating under the name Young Country and later Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by RCA Records for a recording deal.

Alabama&#x27;s biggest success came in the 1980s, when the band had 27 country No. 1 hits, seven multi-platinum albums, and received numerous major awards. Alabama&#x27;s first single on RCA Records, &quot;Tennessee River&quot;, began a streak of 21 country No. 1 singles, including &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; (1981), &quot;Mountain Music&quot; (1982), &quot;Dixieland Delight&quot; (1983), &quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)&quot; (1984) and &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1988). The band&#x27;s popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum albums. Alabama disbanded in 2004 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and has continued to record and tour worldwide.

The band&#x27;s blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of bluegrass, folk and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and sets inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 41 number-one country records on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them the most successful band in country music history. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band and wrote that &quot;It&#x27;s unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.&quot;

Alabama was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019 and was awarded the first-ever Life Time Achievement Award from this institution.

They were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2005.

==History==

===1969–1979: Formation and early years===

Alabama was formed by guitarists Randy Owen and Jeff Cook, and bassist Teddy Gentry, three cousins born and raised near Fort Payne, Alabama, an area with strong country music roots. Owen and Gentry grew up on separate cotton farms on Lookout Mountain (a plateau that stretches across northeastern Alabama, through northwest Georgia and into Tennessee), learning guitar together and singing in church before the age of six. Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s, ranging from pop to bluegrass. Cook joined the band in 1969 forming the group Young Country, which first jammed together around Christmas. Cook also played in numerous other bands and was a rock and roll disc jockey. The three cousins all shared vocal duties, with another cousin, drummer Jackie Owen, completing the group&#x27;s first lineup. The band&#x27;s first performance was at a high school talent contest (playing a Merle Haggard song), for which they won first prize and tickets to the Grand Ole Opry. Despite this, all were too busy with prior commitments to pursue music: Owen still in high school, Cook working for Western Electric, and Gentry laying carpets full-time. The band grew further inactive when Cook and Owen went to college.

The group became a professional band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position playing at the now-defunct Canyon Land theme park near Fort Payne. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slow to materialize, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared a $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, and worked to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights a week at a club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.

The group sent out demo tapes to record companies but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, &quot;I Wanna Be with You Tonight&quot;, in 1977. GRT was more interested in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to The Alabama Band, later shortened to just Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts &quot;Wildcountry&quot; (1976) and &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; (1977), &quot;Alabama Band No. 3&quot; (1979) became the band&#x27;s third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single &quot;I Wanna Come Over&quot;, and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound. &quot;I Wanna Come Over&quot;, became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

===1980–1987: Mainstream success and superstardom===

The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;My Home&#x27;s in Alabama&quot;, received an even better response, reaching the top 20. Their early chart successes led to an invitation to appear at the &quot;New Faces&quot; show at Nashville&#x27;s annual Country Radio Seminar, along with other new acts, such as Reba McEntire. The band had to perform with studio musicians, rather than as a band, and left the session believing they had destroyed their chances. Despite this, the group drew interest from several labels, among those RCA Records, with whom they signed in April 1980. Their first single on RCA, &quot;Tennessee River&quot;, was produced by Harold Shedd and was their first to hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, beginning a streak of over 30 number one hits. &quot;Cashbox&quot; named the band the New Vocal Group of the Year, marking the band&#x27;s first award. In July 1980, the band left their long-time gig at the Bowery, promoting their single which they initially believed to be fluke. The success took the band by surprise and soon became &quot;all but consuming.&quot;

Alabama enjoyed a great deal of creative freedom at RCA; they followed up &quot;Tennessee River&quot; with &quot;Why Lady Why&quot; despite the objections of executives and trade publications, The song became their second number one on the charts. They toured extensively, headlining small clubs and opening for bigger acts in major venues. In addition, the group also received television exposure on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. In February 1981, Alabama released its second major label album, &quot;Feels So Right&quot;; it peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed for more than three years, longer than any other Alabama album. &quot;Old Flame&quot; was their next number one in February 1981, followed by &quot;Feels So Right&quot; in May, and &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; that October. That year, Alabama received a great deal of industry attention: &quot;Billboard&quot; named them New Group for the Year, &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; called them Group of the Year, and the Academy of Country Music (ACM) deemed the band the Vocal Group of the Year. The quartet performed on the 1981 Country Music Association Awards, where it received both Instrumental Group of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year. Although the band received unprecedented success, Owen&#x27;s personal life was falling apart: his father died while he was on the road, affecting him greatly.

&quot;Mountain Music&quot;, released in February 1982, is considered their final release before a significant upgrade in production and sound. All three of the album&#x27;s singles reached number one: &quot;Mountain Music&quot; in May 1982, followed two months later by &quot;Take Me Down&quot; that July, and &quot;Close Enough to Perfect&quot; in October. That year, both &quot;Mountain Music&quot; and &quot;Feels So Right&quot; would go quadruple platinum; by late 1982, the band had sold over six million albums, despite just two years on the national circuit. &quot;Christmas in Dixie&quot;, a seasonal song released in 1982, charted on two of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s music popularity charts in six different calendar years. Alabama became the first group to win CMA&#x27;s prestigious Entertainer of the Year award, which they collected three years in a row, from 1982 to 1984. The group received a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, for &quot;Mountain Music&quot;.

&quot;The Closer You Get...&quot;, released in March 1983, was certified platinum within two months, and also won the Grammy for Best Country Performance. Each of the album&#x27;s singles—&quot;Dixieland Delight&quot;, &quot;The Closer You Get&quot;, and &quot;Lady Down on Love&quot;—were number ones in both the U.S. and Canada. &quot;Roll On&quot; was Alabama&#x27;s next LP, and its four singles, &quot;Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler)&quot;, &quot;When We Make Love&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)&quot;, &quot;(There&#x27;s A) Fire in the Night&quot;, all went to the top in both countries. &quot;40-Hour Week&quot; (1985) continued the band&#x27;s string of multinational successes, with &quot;40 Hour Week (For a Livin&#x27;)&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Man Down&quot; peaking at number one in both territories, with only the lead single, &quot;There&#x27;s No Way&quot;, falling short in Canada (although it peaked at number two). &quot;40-Hour Week&quot; was one of Alabama&#x27;s most popular albums, crossing over in the pop album charts. &quot;Alabama Christmas&quot;, a collection of nine holiday songs plus &quot;Christmas in Dixie&quot;, became Alabama&#x27;s first release on compact disc that September; it was also the centerpiece of a retail and television promotion (sponsored by the Nashville Network).

RCA issued an Alabama &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in January 1986, which went over five times platinum, making the band the most successful country act of the 1980s. &quot;The Touch&quot; followed in September 1986, and although considered one of the weakest in the band&#x27;s catalogue, it did have two number one hits: &quot;&quot;You&#x27;ve Got&quot; the Touch&quot; and &quot;Touch Me When We&#x27;re Dancing&quot;. Their next record, &quot;Just Us&quot;, received a similar critical response, but produced two number ones: &quot;Face to Face&quot; and &quot;Fallin&#x27; Again&quot;. They also contributed their vocals to &quot;Deep River Woman&quot;, a single by Lionel Richie, from Richie&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;. Released in December 1986, the single peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart and number 71 on the Hot 100.

===1987–2004: Decline in popularity and Farewell tour===
By the late 1980s, Alabama&#x27;s sales slowed down considerably, with only their major albums going gold. The group&#x27;s popularity was mostly eclipsed by more traditional-sounding artists such as Alan Jackson, Randy Travis, George Strait, and Dwight Yoakam. Despite this, they continued to be a popular touring act, and the band issued their first live album, &quot;Alabama Live&quot;, in 1988. For 1989&#x27;s &quot;Southern Star&quot;, the band decided to part ways with longtime producer Shedd, instead splitting production duties between Josh Leo and Larry Lee, and the other half with Barry Beckett. &quot;Song of the South&quot; was another number one, and the album&#x27;s remaining singles—&quot;If I Had You&quot;, &quot;High Cotton&quot;, and &quot;Southern Star&quot;—were number ones in both the U.S. and Canada. That year, Alabama was named by &quot;Billboard&quot; the Country Artist of the 1980s and the ACA voted the band the Artist of the Decade.

Although their popularity continued to decline during the 1990s, their studio albums still achieved gold and platinum status. The 1990 album &quot;Pass It on Down&quot; featured three number one singles: &quot;Jukebox in My Mind&quot;, &quot;Forever&#x27;s as Far as I&#x27;ll Go&quot;, and &quot;Down Home&quot;. According to AllMusic, by the time the band released 1992&#x27;s &quot;American Pride&quot;, &quot;they were among the genre&#x27;s aging veterans.&quot; Richard Carlin of &quot;Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary&quot;, suggested that the group&#x27;s harmonies sounded dated to the new audience. &quot;I&#x27;m in a Hurry (And Don&#x27;t Know Why)&quot; became the album&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching number one; the album&#x27;s other singles still fared very well, with &quot;Take a Little Trip&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Lifetime&quot;, and &quot;Hometown Honeymoon&quot; peaking within the top three. &quot;Cheap Seats&quot; followed in 1993, with &quot;Reckless&quot; becoming Alabama&#x27;s final number one, although most of the band&#x27;s singles afterward peaked within the top 10. The band&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;In Pictures&quot;, represented their 18th gold album, more than the total for any other country act to that point. In 1996, the group remained finalists in the Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. The band released &quot;Dancin&#x27; on the Boulevard&quot; in 1997, exploring R&amp;B and beach music. Singles &quot;Sad Lookin&#x27; Moon&quot; and &quot;Dancin&#x27;, Shaggin&#x27; on the Boulevard&quot; were top five hits in the U.S. and Canada. The following year, the group released &quot;For the Record&quot;, a two-disc greatest hits compilation that contained two new singles — &quot;How Do You Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;Keepin&#x27; Up&quot;. Both new tracks were hits on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart, peaking at number two and 14, respectively.

For their 15th studio release, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1999), the band recorded a cover of &quot;(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You&quot; by the boy band NSYNC in 1999, in a move that was considered an attempt to &quot;stay relevant.&quot; The single nonetheless hit number one in Canada, number three on the US country charts, and number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;When It All Goes South&quot; (2001) followed in 2001. &quot;If I never did another CD, this is the one I will always point to as the one that I was happy with the most,&quot; said Owen at the time of its release. Despite this, the album&#x27;s singles did not fare well in comparison to past successes, with only the title track becoming a top 15 hit, representing the band&#x27;s last career peak.

Alabama announced the American Farewell tour in May 2002 at the Country Music Association Awards (CMAs), encompassing 40 tour dates, sponsorships, special events, and a TV special. Owen spoke then on the decision to part ways: &quot;When you get down to it, there are many, many factors involved — some of them very personal. It&#x27;s really about the integrity of the group, the dignity of the group.&quot; Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after 20 years of nonstop touring and recording, and &quot;everybody needed some time.&quot; The tour collected $15 million in box office before it even began, and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003. Due to &quot;extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand,&quot; the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows, running between February and June 2004. The group performed their &quot;final&quot; show in October 2004 in Bismarck, North Dakota, with Herndon jokingly declaring &quot;I need a job&quot; as the concert closed.

===2004–2014: Reunions and lawsuit against Mark Herndon===
In the ensuing years, Owen stayed active as a solo act, Cook with his Allstar Goodtime Band and Gentry as a producer and with his band Rockit City. Herndon and the other group members had a difficult relationship during the band&#x27;s career. While he was present in each press photo and a photo of him once hung at Alabama&#x27;s fan club and museum, Owen contended that he was never an official member of the group. He claimed his inclusion in photos was the label&#x27;s idea, and that Herndon was a paid employee of the band, rather than a member. In May 2008, the other members of the group sued Herndon for $202,670 in money allegedly overpaid to him three years earlier after the band&#x27;s farewell tour concluded. This money was factored into the net profit and given to Herndon before accounting was completed, an allegation Herndon has denied. The band did not sue Herndon until he requested money from the multiple live albums and songs that the band had released but never paid Herndon for playing on. Owen stated that RCA desired Herndon in the band so their image could be comparable to the Beatles. Despite their troubles, he stated they had no hard feelings in an interview years later: &quot;I don&#x27;t have one thing against him in any way in the world.&quot;

Owen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010, but he was later given a clean bill of health, which led to the band&#x27;s reunion, without Herndon. Following a series of tornadoes destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in Birmingham, called Bama Rising. Featuring the band&#x27;s first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. &quot;I guess we realized that maybe we missed the playing ... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, &#x27;Maybe that wasn&#x27;t as bad as we remember it being,&#x27;&quot; said Gentry. In celebration of the group&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians. They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama &amp; Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line&#x27;s Norwegian Pearl ship. In addition, the band released &quot;Alabama &amp; Friends&quot;, a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line, in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.

===2015–present: New music and death of Jeff Cook===
The band released their first new studio album in 14 years, &quot;Southern Drawl&quot;, on September 18, 2015, via BMG Chrysalis. In 2016, Alabama was selected as one of 30 artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; that celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.

In April 2017, guitarist Jeff Cook announced in a video that he would reduce the number of shows for which he would be in attendance while the band was on tour, due to his struggle with Parkinson&#x27;s. He had been diagnosed four years prior, and this was his first public announcement about his condition.

In August 2021, the band sold its interest in its recorded music rights catalog to Reservoir Media. Cook died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on November 7, 2022.

==Musical style and influences==
Alabama&#x27;s music mixes country, rock, and pop, particularly evident in their musical concept: the band was one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay. Despite their influences from other genres, the band was most inspired by country music, which is most evident in their &quot;harmonies, songwriting, and approach.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band is &quot;indebted to country, particularly the Bakersfield sound of Merle Haggard, and the sound of Nashville pop.&quot; The band echoed its country upbringing in one of its first trade articles: &quot;We&#x27;re country first and crossover second. If crossovers come, that&#x27;s great, but we&#x27;d rather have a No. 1. country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts,&quot; said Owen.

By the mid-1980s, the band increasingly moved toward a general pop-rock sound, &quot;going for splashier productions with a more heavily amplified sound.&quot; Alabama&#x27;s lyrics often centered on their homeland. Their first hit single, &quot;Tennessee River&quot;, recounts being &quot;born across the river in the mountains I call home,&quot; while &quot;Dixieland Delight&quot; chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee byway.

==Chart records, sales, and awards==

===Multiplatinum certifications===
Alabama is among the world&#x27;s best-selling bands of all time, having sold a combined 75 million records worldwide. Alabama&#x27;s best-selling studio album is &quot;Mountain Music&quot; (1982), while two greatest hits albums — &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1986) and &quot;For the Record&quot; (1998) — are among their highest in individual sales, with all three totaling five million in sales. Alabama received multiplatinum success for several albums; albums currently certified quadruple platinum include &quot;Feels So Right&quot;, &quot;The Closer You Get...&quot;, and &quot;Roll On&quot;, while Alabama&#x27;s double platinum albums include &quot;My Home&#x27;s in Alabama&quot;, &quot;40-Hour Week&quot;, &quot;Alabama Christmas&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits Volume III&quot;.

===Awards===

Alabama is the most awarded band in the history of country music, with over 200 awards from a variety of organizations. In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal Group of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM&#x27;s Vocal Group of the Year award, and &quot;Billboard&quot; New Group of the Year honors. The group won the CMA&#x27;s prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three consecutive years (1982–84), and the ACM&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982–86). In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM. In addition, Alabama has also received the NARM Gift of Music award, the Alabama Hall of Fame Distinguished Service award, the Country Radio Broadcasters Humanitarian Award, the Prince Matchabelli National Hero Award, the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Legacy==

===Impact===
Alabama has been credited with &quot;substantially broadening country&#x27;s audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history&quot; by Michael McCall of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot;. The band was notable for its three-person lead (as &quot;most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band&quot;), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums. They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs. Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more conservative, older country audience as well. Kurt Wolff described the band&#x27;s appeal: &quot;They&#x27;re just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys&#x27; pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values.&quot; Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.

The band&#x27;s incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart, Shenandoah, Exile, Diamond Rio, Lonestar, Ricochet, and the Mavericks. According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of &quot;Country Music: The Encyclopedia&quot;, the group&#x27;s diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers. Prior to Alabama&#x27;s unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets. Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.

Despite their successes, Alabama&#x27;s career was loathed by music critics of the day, citing the &quot;vacuous songs and watered-down, middle-of-the-road arrangements&quot; that blurred lines between country and pop. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; once argued the band &quot;render[s] country music all but indistinguishable from pop&quot; and thus &quot;trivializes some of country&#x27;s most hallowed traditions.&quot; Indeed, reviewers such as Wolff consider the band&#x27;s &quot;overriding problem&quot; their calculated sound, which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre.

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997, Alabama sponsored the June Jam, a music festival in Fort Payne, which at its peak drew 60,000 fans and raised millions for local charities. The group also held &quot;Fan Appreciation Days&quot;, weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payne. Owen spearheaded &quot;Country Cares for Kids&quot;, an annual country radiothon that raised over $70 million for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

<text>Chromosome 15q partial deletion is a rare human genetic disorder, caused by a chromosomal aberration in which the long (&quot;q&quot;) arm of one copy of chromosome 15 is deleted, or partially deleted. Like other chromosomal disorders, this increases the risk of birth defects, developmental delay and learning difficulties, however, the problems that can develop depend very much on what genetic material is missing. If the mother&#x27;s copy of the chromosomal region 15q11-13 is deleted, Angelman syndrome (AS) can result. The sister syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) can result if the father&#x27;s copy of the chromosomal region 15q11-13 is deleted. The smallest observed region that can result in these syndromes when deleted is therefore called the &quot;PWS/AS critical region&quot;. In addition to deletions, uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 also gives rise to the same genetic disorders, indicating that genomic imprinting must occur in this region.

Deletions of regions of chromosome 15 (notably regions 15q15 and 15q22) on several types of human tumours suggest the presence of a potential tumor suppressor gene. This disorder occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 live births

<text>The year 544 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as year 210 &quot; [[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;. The denomination 544 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. 

Many Buddhist traditions believe it was the year when the Buddha reached parinirvana, though the actual year 0 of the Buddhist calendar corresponds to the previous year, 545 BC.

A mention to the Eastern culture is also inevitable at the times of 544 BC. King Bimbisar of Haraynka Dynastry annexed the territory Anga. Eventually Bimbisar also started the culture of matrimonial alliances.

==Events==
* People of Teos migrate to Abdera, Thrace to escape the yoke of Persia.

<doc id="88869" wikidata="Q745865" url="?curid=88869" title="Trichomoniasis">
<text>Trichomoniasis (trich) is an infectious disease caused by the parasite &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. About 70% of affected people do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms occur, they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.

Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) most often spread by vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching (manual sex). Infected people may spread the disease even when symptoms are absent. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vaginal fluid or urine, or testing for the parasite&#x27;s DNA. If present, other STIs should be tested for.

Methods of prevention include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before having sex with a new partner. Although not caused by a bacterium, trichomoniasis can be cured with certain antibiotics (metronidazole, tinidazole, secnidazole). Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment.

There were about 122 million new cases of trichomoniasis in 2015. In the United States, about 2 million women are affected. It occurs more often in women than men. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; was first identified in 1836 by Alfred Donné. It was first recognized as causing this disease in 1916.

==Signs and symptoms==

Most people infected with &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; do not have any symptoms and it can be undetected for years. Symptoms include pain, burning or itching in the penis, urethra (urethritis), or vagina (vaginitis). Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination. For women, there may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling (&quot;fishy&quot; smell) vaginal discharge. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure. Sometimes trichomoniasis can be confused with chlamydia because the symptoms are similar.

===Complications===
Trichomoniasis is linked to several serious complications.
* Trichomoniasis is associated with an increased risk of transmission and infection of HIV.
* Trichomoniasis may cause a woman to deliver a low-birth-weight or premature infant.
* The role of &quot;Trichomonas&quot; infection in causing cervical cancer is unclear. However, trichomonas infection may be associated with co-infection with high-risk strains of HPV.
* &quot;T. vaginalis&quot; infection in males has been found to cause asymptomatic urethritis and prostatitis. In the prostate, it may create chronic inflammation that may eventually lead to prostate cancer.

==Causes==

The human genital tract is the only reservoir for this species. Trichomonas is transmitted through sexual or genital contact.

The single-celled protozoan produces mechanical stress on host cells and then ingests cell fragments after cell death.

===Genetic sequence===
A draft sequence of the &quot;Trichomonas&quot; genome was published on January 12, 2007, in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, confirming that the genome has at least 26,000 genes, a similar number to the human genome. An additional approximately 34,000 unconfirmed genes, including thousands that are part of potentially transposable elements, brings the gene content to well over 60,000.

==Diagnosis==

There are three main ways to test for trichomoniasis.
* The first is known as saline microscopy. This is the most commonly used method and requires an endocervical, vaginal, or penile swab specimen for examination under a microscope. The presence of one or multiple trichomonads constitutes a positive result. This method is cheap but has a low sensitivity (60–70%) often due to an inadequate sample, resulting in false negatives.
* The second diagnostic method is culture, which has historically been the &quot;gold standard&quot; in infectious disease diagnosis. &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; culture tests are relatively cheap but their sensitivity is still somewhat low (70–89%).
* The third method includes the nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which are more sensitive. These tests are more costly than microscopy and culture, and are highly sensitive (80–90%).

==Prevention==
Use of male condoms or female condoms may help prevent the spread of trichomoniasis, although careful studies have never been done on how to prevent this infection. Infection with trichomoniasis through water is unlikely because &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; dies in water after 45–60 minutes, in thermal water after 30 minutes to 3 hours, and in diluted urine after 5–6 hours.

There are no routine standard screening requirements for the general U.S. population receiving family planning or STI testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends trichomoniasis testing for females with vaginal discharge and can be considered for females at higher risk for infection or of HIV-positive serostatus.

The advent of new, highly specific, and sensitive trichomoniasis tests presents opportunities for new screening protocols for both men and women. Careful planning, discussion, and research are required to determine the cost-efficiency and most beneficial use of these new tests for the diagnosis and treatment of trichomoniasis, which can lead to better prevention efforts.

Several strategies have been found to improve follow-up for STI testing, including email and text messaging as reminders of appointments.

=== Screening ===
Evidence from randomized controlled trials for screening pregnant women who have no symptoms of infection with trichomoniasis and treating women who test positive for the infection have not consistently shown a reduced risk of preterm birth. Further studies are needed to verify this result and determine the best method of screening. In the U.S., screening of pregnant women without symptoms is recommended only for those with HIV, as &quot;Trichomonas&quot; infection is associated with an increased risk of transmitting HIV to the fetus.

==Treatment==
Treatment for both pregnant and non-pregnant women is usually with metronidazole, by mouth once. Caution should be used in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Sexual partners, even if they have no symptoms, should also be treated. Single oral dose of nitroimidazole is sufficient to kill the parasites.

For 95–97% of cases, infection is resolved after one dose of metronidazole. Studies suggest that 4–5% of trichomonas cases are resistant to metronidazole, which may account for some &quot;repeat&quot; cases. Without treatment, trichomoniasis can persist for months to years in women, and is thought to improve without treatment in men. Women living with HIV infection have better cure rates if treated for seven days rather than with one dose.

Topical treatments are less effective than oral antibiotics due to Skene&#x27;s gland and other genitourinary structures acting as reservoirs.

Vaginal boric acid can be useful against resistant trichomoniasis.

==Epidemiology==
There were about 58 million cases of trichomoniasis in 2013. It is more common in females (2.7%) than males (1.4%). It is the most common non-viral STI in the U.S., with an estimated 3.7 million prevalent cases and 1.1 million new cases per year. It is estimated that 3% of the general U.S. population is infected, and 7.5–32% of moderate-to-high risk (including incarcerated) populations.

<doc id="88873" wikidata="Q4785" url="?curid=88873" title="Nest">
<text>A nest is a structure built for certain animals to hold eggs or young. Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates construct nests. They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used. Nests can be found in all types of habitat.

Nest building is driven by a biological urge known as the nesting instinct in birds and mammals. Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest. Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults. Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate communal nests hosting hundreds of individuals. Nests of prairie dogs and several social insects can host millions of individuals.

==Nest building==
===Purposes of nesting===
====Structural purposes====
Nest building (nidification) is often driven by a biological urge in pregnant animals to protect one&#x27;s offspring known as the nesting instinct. Animals build nests to protect their eggs, their offspring, or themselves from danger. The simplest nest structures are adapted to hide eggs from predators, shield them from the sun or other environmental factors, or simply keep them from being scattered in ocean currents. In some cases, nests also help provide safety in numbers for egg-laying animals.

====Social purposes====
Many nest builders provide parental care to their young, while others simply lay their eggs and leave. Brooding (incubating eggs by sitting on them) is common among birds. In general, nest complexity increases in relation to the level of parental care provided. Nest building reinforces social behavior, allowing for larger populations in small spaces to the point of increasing the carrying capacity of an environment. Insects that exhibit the most complex nidification also exhibit the greatest social structure. Among mammals, the naked mole-rat displays a caste structure similar to the social insects while building extensive burrows that house hundreds of individuals.

===Usage of environment===
Versatility in use of construction material may be an adaptive advantage (less energy used to gather materials) or a disadvantage (less ability to specialize construction). The available evidence suggests that natural selection more often favors specialization over flexibility in nest construction.

At the most basic level, there are only two types of nest building: sculpting and assembly.

====Sculpting====
Sculpting is the process of removing material to achieve the desired outcome. Most commonly this entails burrowing into the ground or plant matter to create a nesting site.

====Assembly====
Assembly entails gathering, transporting, and arranging materials to create a novel structure. Transportation has the greatest time and energy cost so animals are usually adapted to build with materials available in their immediate environment.

===Building materials===
Plant matter is the most common construction material for nests. Other common materials include fur or feathers, perhaps from the animal itself, mud or dirt, fecal matter, and specialized secretions from the animal&#x27;s body.

===Effects on environment===
Nest building can have a substantial impact on the environment in which animals live. The combined digging activity of termites and mole-rats in South Africa has created a &quot;mima prairie&quot; landscape marked by huge areas of flat land punctuated by mounds wide and high. Similar structures exist in the United States, created by pocket gophers, and Argentina, rodents of the genus &quot;Ctenomys&quot;.

====Lasting effects====
Nests constructed by megapode birds have been mistaken for anthropological features by professionals, due to their exceptional height () and abundance (hundreds in a single location).

==Nest builders==
Nest architecture may be as useful for distinguishing species as the animals&#x27; physical appearance. Species identified through such means are called &quot;ethospecies&quot;. This is especially common in wasps and termites, but also can apply to birds. In most animals, there is some variation in nest construction between individuals. Whether these differences are driven by genetics or learned behavior is unknown.

With the exception of a few tunneling mammals, nest builders exhibit no specialized anatomy, instead making use of body parts primarily used for other purposes. This is possibly due to the sporadic nature of nest building, minimizing the selective pressures of anatomy used for nest building.

===Birds===
In general, birds are the most skilled nest builders, although not all species of birds build nests, some laying their eggs directly onto rock ledges or bare soil without first modifying the area. Complex nest building is considered to be one of the key adaptive advantages of birds. Nests help regulate temperature and reduce predation risks, thus increasing the chance that offspring live to adulthood.

Bird nests vary from simple depressions in the ground known as scrapes to largely unstructured collections of branches to elaborately woven pendants or spheres. The megapodes, one of the few groups who do not directly brood their young, incubate their young in a mound of decomposing vegetation. One species, &quot;Macrocephalon maleo&quot;, uses volcanic sand warmed by geothermal heat to keep its eggs warm. Among the simple nest builders are falcons, owls, and many shorebirds. The weavers exhibit perhaps the most elaborate nests, complete with strands of grass tied into knots. Most bird nests lie somewhere in the middle, with the majority building cup-shaped nests using some combination of mud, twigs and leaves, and feathers. Some birds, such flamingos and swifts, use saliva to help hold their nest together. The edible-nest swiftlet uses saliva alone to construct their nests. The rufous hornero nest is composed entirely of mud and feces, which is placed on tree branches to allow the sun to harden it into a usable structure. The tailorbirds stitch together leaves to provide cover for their nest sites.
The sociable weaver builds large communal nests in which many individual nests reside. They divide the nest using walls of grass placed atop a base of large sticks. At the entrances to the nest, sharp sticks are placed to ward off intruders. A single communal site can measure in height and in width. As many as 300 mating pairs may reside in the structure. Other birds often built their own nests on top of Weaver nest sites.

Some birds build nests in trees, some (such as eagles, vultures, and many seabirds) will build them on rocky ledges, and others nest on the ground or in burrows. Each species has a characteristic nest style, but few are particular about where they build their nests. Most species will choose whatever site in their environment best protects their nest, taking into account the nest&#x27;s style. Several species will build on a cactus whenever possible. The bushtit and Bullock&#x27;s oriole will suspend their nests from the tips of slender branches. The oropendolas take hanging nests to the extreme, constructing pouches up to tall using hanging vines as their base. The hanging nest is attached to thin tree branches, discouraging predation. Other species seek out crevices, using buildings or birdhouses when tree holes are not available.

Typical bird nests range from in size (hummingbirds) to (eagles) in diameter. The largest nest on record was made by a pair of bald eagles. It was in diameter, deep and was estimated to weigh more than . The lightest bird nests may weigh only a few grams. Incubation mounds of the mallee fowl can reach heights of and widths of . It is estimated the animal uses as much as of material in its construction. The extinct &quot;Sylviornis neocaledoniae&quot; may have constructed nesting mounds in diameter.

===Mammals===


Many species of small mammals such as rodents, rabbits, and ground squirrels dig burrows into the ground to protect themselves and their young. Prairie dogs build an elaborate system of tunnels which can span large stretches of land. One such structure, called a town, spanned and held an estimated 400 million individuals. Their homes are adapted to withstand large (above-ground) temperature variation, floods, and fire. Their young are raised in the deepest chambers where the temperature is the most stable.

Many mammals, including raccoons and skunks, seek natural cavities in the ground or in trees to build their nests. Raccoons, and some rodents, use leaves to build nests underground and in trees. Tree squirrels build their nests (dreys) in trees, while voles nest in tall grass. In some species, the nest serve as homes for adults while in others they are used to raise young. The duck-billed platypus and the echidna lay eggs in nests.

Gorillas build fresh nests daily out of leaves and other vegetation in which they sleep at night. They sometimes also build nests during the day for resting in. The smaller species of gorilla build their nests in trees, while the larger are confined to the ground. Nests of the western gorilla, the largest species, measure about in diameter.

===Amphibians===

Some species of frog build nests ranging from simple to modest complexity. Many stream-dwelling frogs lay their eggs in a gelatinous mass which they attach to underwater vegetation to prevent eggs from washing away. Nests can have other protective qualities. For example, the female Fletcher frog beats secreted mucus into a froth, creating a structure that serves as a line of defense against thermal extremes, predation, and desiccation.

===Fish===
Fish engage in nest building activities ranging from simply scooping out sediment to building enclosed structures out of plant matter. Male sticklebacks produce a special enzyme in their kidneys that they use to bind plants together.

===Reptiles===

The American alligator is known for its parenting skills. They build large nests of mud and vegetation on river banks or vegetation mats. The female digs a hole in the center to lay her eggs, covers them, and then guards them for two months until they hatch. When eggs start to hatch, she breaks open the nest which has hardened over time and leads the young to the water where she continues to care for them for another year. Alligators are very particular about their nesting sites and will abandon a site if things go wrong.

Cobras use leaves and other debris to build nests in which they lay eggs that both sexes guard. They carry the vegetation to the nest site by kinking their necks. Sea turtles dig a hole in the sand above the high tide line in which they lay their eggs. They then cover the soft eggs to protect them from the sun and predators and leave.

===Dinosaurs===
From the fossil record, it is known that many, or perhaps all, dinosaurs laid eggs. Paleontologists have identified a number of features that allow them to distinguish a nesting site from a random clustering of eggs. Those include regular clustering patterns, the co-occurrence of whole eggs with broken eggs and/or hatchlings, and the occurrence of physical features such as evidence of excavation.
The &quot;Oviraptor&quot; nests of Mongolia are perhaps the most famous case of dinosaur nesting. One specimen was found fossilized atop a nest in a brooding posture, proving the animal had been poorly named (Oviraptor means &quot;egg taker&quot;).

A site known as Egg Mountain in Montana provides exceptional evidence of dinosaur nesting behavior. The site features dozens of nests each with 20 or more eggs belonging to the &quot;Maiasaura&quot;. Juvenile teeth at the site exhibit signs of wear, while the leg bones are not developed enough to walk. This allowed scientists to conclude that the species provided extensive parental care for its young. It is likely the species covered its nests with sand and vegetation to keep them warm and nested in colonies for increased protection.

===Insects===

Social insects, including most species of ants, bees, termites, and wasps, are nest builders. Their often elaborate nests may be found above or below ground. Features often include ventilation systems and separate chambers for the queen, her eggs, and developing individuals.

Bees and hornets often seek out natural cavities in which to construct their nests, also known as hives, in which they store food and raise their young. Other species of bee and some wasps dig holes in the ground or chew through wood. In the species &quot;Megachile rotundata&quot;, for example, females construct tubular-shaped nests in rotting wood as well as small holes in the ground, creating, each cell made from circular disks cut from plant leaves using the bee&#x27;s mandibles. Bee nests are founded upon the wax the secrete from their bodies, while those of wasps are dependent on their ability to turn plant water into paper using their saliva. Nests often exhibit divided living, with eggs and food stores kept in distinct parts of the hive. Vespid wasps build complex nests from paper-like material where they lay eggs in individual cells. When the young hatch, their parents feed them chewed up larvae. Different species exhibit different nest structures. Paper wasp nesting consist of a single tier of cells, while yellow jacket nests can be many layers thick, reaching up to in diameter. Nesting strategies can be plastic, for instance the wasp &quot;Parischnogaster mellyi&quot; will significant vary its nest construction based on environmental conditions, and the wasp &quot;Mischocyttarus mexicanus&quot; is known to nest in groups or alone depending on the distribution of potential nest sites in the area. Nest sizes vary dramatically and the largest wasp nest on record measured in diameter and was tall. Found in New Zealand, it was likely built by the German wasp.
Termites build elaborate nests that span multiple generations and may last decades. Using chewed wood, mud, and feces they build large mounds which may extend well into the air. The largest nests, built by members of genus &quot;Amitermes&quot;, stand nearly tall with a similar circumference at the base, and host millions of individuals. Termite mounds are constructed to allow for excellent air flow, regulating the mound temperature. The mounds protect against drying and predation allowing many species to lose ancestral traits such as hard bodies, skin pigmentation, and good eyesight. Magnetic termites construct their nests with flattened sides along the north–south axis to ensure maximum warming during the winter, while exposing minimal surface area to the harshest mid-day sunshine. Other termite species use their nests to farm fungi.

Ant nests feature an elaborate colony structure that may extend or more underground. As the structure gets further underground, individual chambers become farther and farther apart indicating that the ant is aware of its depth. It is hypothesized that they accomplish this by sensing the level of carbon dioxide in the soil. The leaf cutter ant builds a complex nest which can house 8 million individuals. Its nests feature numerous chambers, most notably garden chambers where they farm fungus on leaves they harvest from the forest.

Species such as the carpenter ant and the wasp &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot; build &quot;satellite nests&quot; - smaller nests near, but separate from, the main nest. These satellite nests are used as an insurance against predators and parasites; if the original nest is attacked, surviving members can move the satellite nest. Other species such as the Black hover wasp, &quot;Parischnogaster alternata,&quot; construct nests in clusters with the central core composed of older colonies surrounded by younger colonies.

The Eastern carpenter bee, &quot;Xylocopa virginica,&quot; is unique in that individuals of that species build their nests in wood, bamboo culms, agave stalks, and other similar materials, although their preferred nesting material is pine or cedar lumber. When digging the nests, they use the wood shavings scraped from the wall to create partitions within the tunnels. The nests are usually round and have about 1-4 tunnels, each with multiple branches. Because these materials are often useful for humans in construction, &quot;X. virgininica&#x27;s&quot; nesting behavior presents the disadvantage of weakening wood in manmade structures.

==Effects on other species==
The abundance of biological resources within the nest has led to a number of specialized predators. The aardvark and the ant eater use long tongues to prey upon termite and ant nests. Birds such as the honey buzzard specialize on wasp and bee nests, a resource also targeted by the tropical hornet. Symbiosis, ranging from feeding on waste to obligate parasitism, is common within the nest. Ant nests alone support symbiotes spanning six classes of arthropods which includes 35 families just from the beetles.

<doc id="88874" wikidata="Q467115" url="?curid=88874" title="Hiram I">
<text>Hiram I (Phoenician: 𐤇𐤓𐤌 &quot;Ḥirōm&quot; &quot;my brother is exalted&quot;; Hebrew: חירם &quot;Ḥīrām&quot;; also called &quot;Hirom&quot; or &quot;Huram&quot;)
was the Phoenician king of Tyre according to the Hebrew Bible. His regnal years have been calculated by some as 980 to 947 BC, in succession to his father, Abibaal. Hiram was succeeded as King of Tyre by his son Baal-Eser I. Hiram is also mentioned in the writings of Menander of Ephesus (early 2nd century BC), as preserved in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Against Apion&quot;, which adds to the biblical account. According to Josephus, Hiram lived for 53 years and reigned 34.

==Reign==
During Hiram&#x27;s reign, Tyre grew from a satellite of Sidon into the most important of Phoenician cities, and the holder of a large trading empire. He suppressed the rebellion of the first Tyrean colony at Utica, near the later site of Carthage (&quot;Against Apion&quot; i:18).

The Hebrew Bible says that he allied himself with David, king of Judah and his artisans built David&#x27;s palace in Jerusalem after his capture of the city. The palace was built using Lebanon Cedar. After David&#x27;s death, Hiram maintained his alliance with David&#x27;s son and successor Solomon, again as an equal (&quot;אחי&quot;, meaning &quot;my brother&quot;) Through the alliance with Solomon, Hiram ensured himself access to the major trade routes to Egypt, Arabia and Mesopotamia. The two kings also jointly opened a trade route over the Red Sea, connecting the Israelite harbour of Ezion-Geber with a land called Ophir. Some schools of thought suggest that this land of Ophir was in the port city of Sopara, near modern Mumbai (Bombay), India.

According to the Bible, both kings grew rich through this trade, and Hiram sent Solomon architects, workmen, cedar wood, and gold to build the First Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus says that he also extended the Tyrean harbour, enlarged the city by joining the two islands on which it was built, and constructed a royal palace and a temple for Melqart (&quot;Against Apion&quot; i:17)

==Hypotheses regarding chronology of reign==

The beginning date of Hiram&#x27;s reign is derived from a statement by Josephus by citing both Tyrian court records and the writings of Menander, relating that 143 years passed between the start of construction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple until the founding of Carthage (or until Dido&#x27;s flight that led to its founding). Josephus also related that Hiram&#x27;s reign began 155 years and 8 months before that event and that construction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple began in the twelfth year of Hiram&#x27;s reign, which would be 143 years before the building of Carthage.

As pointed out by William Barnes (1801–1886), the date for the start of Temple construction using the Tyrian data is derived &quot;wholly independently&quot; of the way that date is derived by using the Scriptural data.

By incorporating another source, Pompeius Trogus&#x27; date for the founding of Carthage (825 B.C.), we can arrive at an alternate solution.  This approach places the beginning of Hiram&#x27;s reign in 979/8 B.C. and the commencement of Temple construction eleven years later, in 968/7 B.C.  It is important to note that most chronological systems place the start of Solomon&#x27;s reign around 971/70 B.C.

== Hiram I of Tyre: ally and potential facilitator of Solomon&#x27;s Golden Age ==
Hiram I, king of Tyre, ruled a powerful Phoenician city-state during the 10th century BCE.  The exact dates of his reign are debated by scholars, with estimates placing it between 980 and 947 BCE. His reign coincided with the rise of the United Kingdom of Israel under King David and his son, Solomon. The available evidence, primarily drawn from the Hebrew Bible and archaeological discoveries, suggests a potentially significant relationship between Hiram and the Israelite kings, particularly Solomon.

The Hebrew Bible portrays Hiram as a close associate of the Israelite monarchs (1 Kings 5:1-18; 2 Chronicles 2:2-16). According to the biblical narrative, Hiram supplied skilled laborers, cedar wood, and other materials to King David for the construction of his palace in Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 14:1). This account, while potentially embellished, hints at a cooperative relationship between the two leaders.

However, it is during Solomon&#x27;s reign that the most detailed descriptions of Hiram&#x27;s role emerge. The Bible describes a specific agreement between the two kings for the construction of monumental projects in Jerusalem: Solomon&#x27;s Temple and his royal palace (1 Kings 5). This agreement, if factual, suggests a formalized partnership. The narrative details that Hiram provided skilled laborers, artisans, and vast quantities of prized cedar and cypress wood from the forests of Lebanon (1 Kings 5:6-10). In return, Solomon offered Tyre essential resources like wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine (1 Kings 5:11-12). This exchange, if accurately depicted, highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial economic relationship fostered by the agreement.

Beyond the Hebrew Bible, references to Hiram are limited. Notably, Josephus, a 1st-century CE Jewish historian, mentions Hiram in his work &quot;Against Apion&quot; (i:18). Citing Menander of Ephesus, a 3rd-century BCE historian, Josephus credits Hiram with quelling a rebellion in the Phoenician colony of Utica (near modern-day Carthage).

While limited historical evidence exists outside the Bible, it suggests a period of prosperity and expansion for Tyre under Hiram&#x27;s leadership. The potential alliance with Israel could have provided Tyre with access to valuable resources and new markets. Conversely, Solomon might have benefitted from Tyre&#x27;s skilled workforce and expertise in maritime trade and construction. Further research is necessary to definitively establish the nature and extent of their collaboration. Regardless, Hiram&#x27;s reign likely marked a period of significant cultural and economic exchange between the two kingdoms, with a lasting impact on the region.

==&quot;Tomb of Hiram&quot;==
The &quot;Tomb of Hiram&quot; (Qabr Hiram) dates from the Persian period, four to six centuries after the presumed time of Hiram. It is built 6 km southeast of Tyre, near the village of Hanaouay, on the road to Qana and has the form of a colossal limestone sarcophagus on a pedestal.

==In modern fiction==
King Hiram is a character in the time travel story &quot;Ivory, and Apes, and Peacocks&quot; (1983) by Poul Anderson.

== Namesakes ==
In 1829, the Town of Tyre was formed in Seneca County in the state of New York and the choice of its name was presumably inspired by ancient Tyre, according to the Town Historian. Likewise, its Hiram Lay Cobblestone Farmhouse, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was apparently named after the Phoenician king.

In the Southern Lebanese city of Tyre there is a neighbourhood called Hay Hiram, located in Tyre&#x27;s northern municipality of Abassiyat. Hiram Hospital is based in that neighbourhood and nearby there is a Hiram Pharmacy. In the centre of Tyre&#x27;s Sour municipality main street is named after Hiram (spelled &quot;Hyram&quot; on Google Maps). Hiram Street suffers from high traffic congestion, air and noise pollution.

<text>Interstate 20 (I‑20) is a major east–west Interstate Highway in the Southern United States. I-20 runs beginning at an interchange with I-10 in Reeves County, Texas, and ending at an interchange with I-95 in Florence, South Carolina. Between Texas and South Carolina, I-20 runs through northern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The major cities that I-20 connects to include Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; and Columbia, South Carolina.

From its terminus at I-95, the highway continues about eastward into the city of Florence as I-20 Business (I-20 Bus.).

I-20 runs from Texas to South Carolina serving major southern economic hubs such as Dallas–Fort Worth and Atlanta.

===Texas===
I-20 begins in western Reeves County at a fork with I-10. From there, the highway travels east-northeastward through Odessa, Midland, and Abilene before turning eastward toward the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The La Entrada al Pacífico corridor runs along I-20 between US Route 385 (US 385) and Farm to Market Road 1788 (FM 1788). Between Monahans and I-10, I-20 has an speed limit.

From the highway&#x27;s opening in the 1960s through 1977, I-20 originally went through the heart of the metroplex via the Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike. This old route is now signed I-30 (Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike and from US 80/I-30 intersection at Mesquite to Downtown Dallas), US 80 (former stretch between I-635 and Terrell), and Spur 557 (bypass around Terrell). In 1977, I-20 was rerouted to go through the southern sections of Fort Worth, Arlington, Grand Prairie, Dallas, and Mesquite. It split off from the old route initially at I-820 in west Fort Worth the later on at its current junction near Aledo in Parker County. It rejoins the old route near Terrell. Part of I-20 in Dallas used to be signed as I-635 and shares the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway name with the remainder of I-635. Parts on the south side of Fort Worth were originally signed as I-820.

I-20 continues eastward from Terrell, bypassing Tyler, Longview, and Marshall before crossing the Louisiana border near Waskom.

===Louisiana===
In Louisiana, I-20 roughly parallels US 80 through the northern part of the state.

Entering the state from near Waskom, Texas, the highway immediately enters the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan area, intersecting I-49 near downtown Shreveport and passing close to Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City.

I-20 traverses mainly rural, hilly terrain, bypassing Minden, Grambling, and Ruston before reaching Monroe.

From Monroe, I-20 enters flatter terrain as it approaches the Mississippi River. Before crossing the Mississippi, the highway passes Tallulah. At the Mississippi River, I-20 leaves Louisiana and enters Vicksburg.

===Mississippi===
Upon entering Mississippi by crossing the Mississippi River, I-20 immediately enters Vicksburg. Between Edwards and Clinton, the highway mostly follows the original two-lane routing of US 80. In Jackson, I-20 sees a short concurrency with both I-55 and US 49. Also in Jackson is an unusually expansive stack interchange, at the junction of I-20, I-55 north, and US 49 south. The interchange replaces a former directional interchange at I-55 north and a cloverleaf interchange at US 49. From the stack, I-20 continues eastward to Meridian, where it begins the nearly overlap with I-59.

The route of the Mississippi section of I-20 is defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.

===Alabama===
I-20 (along with I-59) crosses the Alabama state line near York, and it stays conjoined as it passes through western Alabama and Tuscaloosa. At Birmingham, the two highways pass through downtown together before splitting at exit 130 just east of Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport. I-20 continues eastward through Oxford–Anniston and the Talladega National Forest, passing by Talladega Superspeedway in the process, which is visible from the highway.

Also in Birmingham, the intersection of I-20/I-59 and I-65 was known as a Malfunction Junction because of the interchange&#x27;s somewhat-confusing design, and the number of traffic accidents that occurred there. This section of the Interstate and its interchanges have since been reconfigured.

===Georgia===
I-20 enters Georgia near Tallapoosa and after passing through western Georgia, it enters the Atlanta metropolitan area. On clear days, eastbound motorists get their first view of Downtown Atlanta as they come over the top of Six Flags Hill. The Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park is easily visible off exit 46 eastbound. The highway then passes through the center of Atlanta, meeting with I-75 and I-85, which share a common expressway (the Downtown Connector). It continues through the Atlanta metropolitan area eastward and through the eastern half of Georgia until it exits the state, crossing the Savannah River at Augusta.

Throughout the state, I-20 is conjoined with unsigned State Route 402 (SR 402). Also, I-20 from the Alabama state line to I-285 in Atlanta is named the &quot;Tom Murphy Freeway&quot;, but it is called the &quot;Ralph David Abernathy Freeway&quot; within I-285. The Interstate Highway is also named the Purple Heart Highway from I-285 in DeKalb County to US 129/US 441/SR 24 in Madison, Georgia, and it is called the Carl Sanders Highway from US 129/US 441/SR 24 to the South Carolina state line.

===South Carolina===
Upon leaving Augusta, I-20 crosses the Savannah River and enters the Palmetto State and heads northeastward, bypassing Aiken and Lexington before reaching the state capital of Columbia, which can be reached most directly by taking I-26 east at exit 64 (&quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;), then, almost immediately, I-126/US 76.

At Columbia, I-20 bypasses the city to the north and again turns northeastward, bypassing Fort Jackson and Camden. After crossing the Wateree River, it turns due east and passes by tiny Bishopville, before reaching the Florence area. It is near Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at I-95. However, for about , the highway continues into Florence as I-20 Bus.

I-20 in the Palmetto State is known as either the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway or John C. West Freeway. The first section to be completed was the bridge over the Savannah River in 1965; the last, the section between US 401 and I-95 (including the business spur), opened in August 1975.

==History==

I-20 was built in 1957 connecting Texas to the east coast running through Shreveport, Ruston, and Monroe making it their first Interstate.

I-20&#x27;s exit numbers in Georgia were changed in 2000.

In 2003, the North Carolina Department of Transportation proposed extending I-20 eastward from Florence to Wilmington at the behest of North Carolina Governor Mike Easley and his &#x27;Strategic Transportation Plan&#x27; for the southeast portion of the state. The proposed route would follow US 76 east from Florence to Whiteville, North Carolina, then parallel US 74/US 76 into Wilmington. Part of this route is already designated the future eastern extension of I-74. As part of the 2005 Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users transportation legislation, North Carolina received $5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for a feasibility study for this extension. While this extension has considerable support among towns in southeastern North Carolina, the South Carolina Department of Transportation has stated that they have no interest in upgrading their portion of US 76 to an Interstate. Instead, South Carolina is concentrating their efforts on plans to build I-73 that will terminate near Myrtle Beach. This proposed extension is currently unfunded.

==Auxiliary routes==
Two I-420s were planned but never completed or built. One was to be a bypass around Monroe, Louisiana, but was never built. The other I-420 was planned as a bypass to the south of Downtown Atlanta. Due to anti-freeway sentiments, this I-420 was never completed, and the already-built portion has been signed as State Route 154 (SR 154)/SR 166, named the Langford Parkway (formerly the Lakewood Freeway).

<text>The national flag of the Kingdom of Belgium is a tricolour consisting of three equal vertical bands displaying the national colours: black, yellow, and red. The flag of Belgium also resembles the flag of Germany except the color sequence is black, red, yellow and the bands are horizontal. The colours were taken from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant, and the vertical design may be based on the flag of France. When flown, the black band is nearest the pole (at the hoist side). It has the unusual proportions of 1315, and therefore, unlike the flags of Switzerland and the Vatican City, it is not a perfect square. 

In 1830, the flag, at that time non-officially, consisted of three horizontal bands, with the colors red, yellow and black. On 23 January 1831, the National Congress enshrined the tricolor in the Constitution, but did not determine the direction and order of the color bands. As a result, the &quot;official&quot; flag was given vertical stripes with the colors black, yellow and red.

==Previous flags==
After the death of Charlemagne, the present-day territory of Belgium (except the County of Flanders) became part of Lotharingia, which had a flag of two horizontal red stripes separated by a white stripe. The territory then passed into Spanish hands, and after the coronation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, yellow and red, the colours of Spain, were added. From the 16th century to the end of the 18th century, the colours of what is now Belgium were red, white and yellow. Occasionally, the red Cross of Burgundy was placed on the white section of the flag.

During the period of Austrian rule, a number of different flags were tried. Eventually, the Austrian emperor imposed the Austrian flag. The population of Brussels was opposed to this, and, following the example of France, red, yellow and black cockades began to appear, those being the colours of Brabant. The colours thus correspond to the red lion of Hainaut, Limburg and Luxembourg, the yellow lion of Brabant, and the black lion of Flanders and Namur.

==Independence and adoption of current flag==
On 26 August 1830, the day after the rioting at the La Monnaie opera house and the start of the Belgian Revolution, the flag of France flew from the city hall of Brussels. The insurgents hastily replaced it with a tricolour of red, yellow, and black horizontal stripes (similar to the one used during the Brabant Revolution of 1789–1790 which had established the United States of Belgium) made at a nearby fabric store. As a result, Article 193 of the Constitution of Belgium describes the colours of the Belgian nation as &quot;Red, Yellow, and Black,&quot; the reverse order shown in the official flag.

On 23 January 1831, the stripes changed from horizontal to vertical, and on 12 October, the flag attained its modern form, with the black placed at the hoist side of the flag.

==Design and specifications==
The official guide to protocol in Belgium states that the national flag measures tall for each wide, giving it a ratio of 13:15. Each of the stripes is one-third of the width of the flag. The yellow is in fact yellow and not the darker gold of the flag of Germany, which is a black-red-gold tricolour, striped horizontally.

==Variants==
===National flag and civil ensign===
The national flag has the unusual proportions of 13:15.
The 2:3 flag is the civil ensign, the correct flag for use by civilians at sea.

===Naval ensign and jack===
The naval ensign of Belgium has the three national colours in a saltire, on a white field, with a black crown above crossed cannons at the top and a black anchor at the bottom. It was created in 1950, shortly after the Belgian Navy was re-established, having been a section of the British Royal Navy during World War II, and it is reminiscent of the White Ensign of the Royal Navy.

There is also an official Belgian naval jack, which is the same as the national flag, except in a 1:1 ratio, making it square.

===Royal standard and flags on the royal palaces===
The royal standard of Belgium is the personal standard of the current king, Philippe, and features his monogram, an &#x27;F&#x27; (for the Dutch &#x27;Filip&#x27;), crossed with a &#x27;P&#x27; in the four corners. The designs of royal standards of past monarchs have been similar.

Notably, the flag of Belgium flown on the Royal Palace of Brussels and the Royal Castle of Laeken is in none of the proportions above. It has the irregular 4:3 ratio, making it taller than it is wide. The stripes remain vertical. These proportions are explained as an aesthetic consideration, as the palaces are large, and the flags are thus viewed from far below, which makes them look more normal due to foreshortening.

The flags are flown above the palaces when the monarch is in Belgium, not necessarily just in one of the palaces. The flags are not flown if the monarch is on a state visit overseas or on holiday outside of Belgium. There have been exceptions to this rule, but, in general, presence or absence of the flag is a reasonably reliable indicator of whether or not the monarch is in the country.

==Protocol==

As Belgium is a federal state, the flag of Belgium and the flags of the communities or regions in principle occupy the same rank. Nonetheless, when flags are raised and lowered or carried in a procession, the national flag takes precedence over all the others.

The order of precedence is:
#The national flag of Belgium
#The flag of the community or region of Belgium
#The European Flag
#The flags of the provinces of Belgium, in alphabetical order in the local language, if more than one is flown
#The flag of the municipality

If there is a visiting head of state, that country&#x27;s flag may be set second in precedence, all other flags dropping a rank.

<doc id="88885" wikidata="Q42448" url="?curid=88885" title="Sheffield">
<text>Sheffield is a city in South Yorkshire, England, situated south of Leeds and east of Manchester. The city serves as the administrative centre of the City of Sheffield. It is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire and some of its southern suburbs were transferred from Derbyshire to the city council. It is the largest settlement in South Yorkshire as well as the third largest of Northern England.

The city is in the eastern foothills of the Pennines and the valleys of the River Don with its four tributaries: the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin and the Sheaf. Sixty-one per cent of Sheffield&#x27;s entire area is green space and a third of the city lies within the Peak District national park and is the fifth-largest city in England. There are more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens in the city, which is estimated to contain around 4.5 million trees. 

Sheffield played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, developing many significant technologies. In the 19th century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when processes for high-quality stainless steel and crucible steel were invented based on previous discoveries elsewhere. This fuelled an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area. The Yorkshire ridings became counties in their own right in 1889; the West Riding of Yorkshire county was disbanded in 1974. The city then became part of the county of South Yorkshire; this has been made up of separately governed unitary authorities since 1986. The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment in Sheffield, consistent with other British cities. Sheffield&#x27;s gross value added (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at £11.3 billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth, averaging around 5% annually, which is greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.

Sheffield had a population of 556,500 at the 2021 census, making it the second-largest city in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The Sheffield Built-up Area, of which the Sheffield sub-division is the largest part, had a population of 685,369 also including the town of Rotherham. The district borough, governed from the city, had a population of at the mid-2019 estimate, making it the -most-populous district in England. It is one of eleven British cities that make up the Core Cities Group. In 2011, the unparished area had a population of 490,070.

The city has a long sporting heritage and is home both to the world&#x27;s oldest football club, Sheffield F.C., and the world&#x27;s oldest football ground, Sandygate. Matches between the two professional clubs, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday, are known as the Steel City derby. The city is also home to the World Snooker Championship and the Sheffield Steelers, the UK&#x27;s first professional ice hockey team.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sheffield&quot;, has its origins in Old English and derives from the name of a principal river in the city, the River Sheaf, which runs through Sheffield albeit in culverts underneath the city centre. This name, in turn, is a corruption of &quot;shed&quot; or &quot;sheth&quot;, which refers to a &quot;divide&quot; or &quot;separation&quot;. The second half of the name Sheffield refers to a field, or forest clearing. Combining the two words, it is believed that the name refers to an Anglo-Saxon settlement in a clearing by the confluence of the River Don and River Sheaf. In historical Latin, Sheffield is recorded with the Latinized name &quot;Sefelda&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===

The area now occupied by the City of Sheffield is believed to have been inhabited since at least the late Upper Paleolithic, about 12,800 years ago. The earliest evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. In the Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who are thought to have constructed several hillforts in and around Sheffield.

Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Brittonic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. A Britonnic presence within the Sheffield area is evidenced by two settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield. The settlements that grew and merged to form Sheffield, however, date from the second half of the first millennium, and are of Anglo-Saxon and Danish origin. In Anglo-Saxon times, the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that Eanred of Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829, a key event in the unification of the kingdom of England under the House of Wessex.

After the Norman conquest of England, insurrection by the populace led to the devastation of the Sheffield area during the Harrying of the North and Sheffield Castle was built to control the ruined local settlements. A small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city. By 1296, a market had been established at what is now known as Castle Square, and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th century, Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, and by the early 1600s it had become the main centre of cutlery manufacture in England outside London, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire. From 1570 to 1584, Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and Sheffield Manor.

===Industrial Revolution===
During the 1740s, a form of the crucible steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield&#x27;s growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19th century; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The Sheffield and Rotherham railway was constructed in 1838, connecting the two towns. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842, and was granted city status by letters patent in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town.

The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in the Great Sheffield Flood, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town. In 1880 ten men from Sheffield were part of a group of 47 men who had attended a fancy-dress ball in Hulme, Manchester, but they were tried for soliciting sex between men. Described by historian Lauren Wells as the &#x27;Sheffield Ten&#x27;, men from the city had their addresses published in local news.

The growing population led to the construction of many back-to-back dwellings that, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired George Orwell in 1937 to write: &quot;Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World&quot;.
===Blitz===

The Great Depression hit the city in the 1930s, but as international tensions increased and the Second World War became imminent; Sheffield&#x27;s steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and ammunition for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, now known as the Sheffield Blitz. The city was partially protected by barrage balloons managed from RAF Norton. More than 660 people died and many buildings were destroyed or left badly damaged, including the Marples Hotel, which was hit directly by a 500-pound bomb, killing over 70 people.

===Post-Second World War===
In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the city&#x27;s slums were demolished, and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads. In February 1962, the city was devastated by the Great Sheffield Gale; winds of up to killed four people and damaged 150,000 houses, more than two-thirds of the city&#x27;s housing stock at the time. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield&#x27;s industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK. The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much-needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.

===21st century===
Sheffield is changing rapidly as new projects regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such, the &quot;Heart of the City Project&quot;, with £470 million investment, has initiated a number of public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Gallery opened in April 2001, the Winter Gardens were opened in May 2003, and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Additional developments included the remodelling of Sheaf Square, in front of the refurbished railway station: the square contains &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;, a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd and made from Sheffield steel. Recent development known as the &#x27;Heart of the City&#x27; includes the restoration of the listed Leah&#x27;s Yard complex.

Sheffield was particularly hard hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 &#x27;Big Freeze&#x27;. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Hillsborough Stadium flooded due to being close to rivers that flow through the city. In 2010, 5,000 properties in Sheffield were identified as still being at risk of flooding. In 2012 the city narrowly escaped another flood, despite extensive work by the Environment Agency to clear local river channels since the 2007 event. In 2014 Sheffield Council&#x27;s cabinet approved plans to further reduce the possibility of flooding by adopting plans to increase water catchment on tributaries of the River Don. Another flood hit the city in 2019, resulting in shoppers being contained in Meadowhall Shopping Centre.

Between 2014 and 2018, there were disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city&#x27;s 36,000 highway trees. Around 4,000 highway trees have since been felled as part of the &#x27;Streets Ahead&#x27; Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract signed in 2012 by the city council, Amey plc and the Department for Transport to maintain the city streets. The tree fellings have resulted in many arrests of residents and other protesters across the city even though most felled trees in the city have been replanted, including those historically felled and not previously replanted. The protests eventually stopped in 2018 after the council paused the tree felling programme as part of a new approach developed by the council for the maintenance of street trees in the city.

In May 2022, Sheffield was named a &quot;Tree City of the World&quot; in recognition of its work to sustainably manage and maintain urban forests and trees. This honour was given before the release of the independent inquiry&#x27;s report on the so-called &quot;Sheffield Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. The report concluded that &quot;thousands of healthy and loved trees were lost. Many more could have been&quot; and was critical of Sheffield City Council. The latter issued this statement on receipt of the report: &quot;the council has already acknowledged that it got many things wrong in the handling of the street-trees dispute, and we wish to reiterate our previous apologies for our failings&quot;.

==Governance==
===Local authority===

Sheffield is governed at the local level by Sheffield City Council and is led by Councillor Tom Hunt (Assumed office 16 May 2023). It consists of 84 councillors elected to represent 28 wards: three councillors per ward. Following the 2024 local elections, the distribution of council seats is Labour 36, Liberal Democrats 27, the Green Party 14, Conservative 0 and Independent 7. The city also has a Lord Mayor; though now simply a ceremonial position, in the past the office carried considerable authority, with executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. The position of Lord Mayor is elected on an annual basis.

For much of its history the council was controlled by the Labour Party, and was noted for its leftist sympathies; during the 1980s, when Sheffield City Council was led by David Blunkett, the area gained the epithet the &quot;Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire&quot;. However, the Liberal Democrats controlled the Council between 1999 and 2001 and took control again from 2008 to 2011.

The majority of council-owned facilities are operated by independent charitable trusts. Sheffield International Venues runs many of the city&#x27;s sporting and leisure facilities, including Sheffield Arena and the English Institute of Sport, Sheffield. Sheffield Museums take care of galleries and museums owned by the council.

===Combined authority===

The city of Sheffield is part of the wider South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority, headed by mayor Oliver Coppard since 2022. The combined authority covers the former 1974–1986 South Yorkshire County Council area which functions either went to local or regional authorities.

In 2004, as part of the &quot;Moving Forward: The Northern Way&quot; document, city regions were created in a collaboration with the three northern regional development agencies. These became independent Local enterprise partnerships in 2011.

The area&#x27;s partnership retains the Sheffield City Region name, covering the South Yorkshire authorities, as well as Bolsover District, Borough of Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, North East Derbyshire and Bassetlaw District. In 2014, the &quot;Sheffield City Region Combined authority&quot; was formed by the South Yorkshire local authorities with the other councils as non-constituent members and the partnership integrated with the authority structure. In September 2020, the authority changed to its current name.

===Parliamentary Representation===
The city returns five members of parliament to the House of Commons, with a sixth, the Member of Parliament for Penistone and Stocksbridge representing parts of Sheffield and Barnsley. The former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was an MP for Sheffield, representing Sheffield Hallam from 2005 until he was unseated 2017, when the seat returned a Labour MP for the first time in its history.

==Geography==

Sheffield is located at . It lies directly beside Rotherham, from which it is separated largely by the M1 motorway. Although Barnsley Metropolitan Borough also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with Derbyshire; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages, including Totley, Dore and the area now known as Mosborough Townships. 

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city. It nestles in the eastern foothills of the Pennines, between the main upland range and Peak District National Park to the west, and the lower-lying South Yorkshire Coalfield to the east. It lies at the confluence of five rivers: Don, Sheaf, Rivelin, Loxley and Porter. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside. Blake Street, in the S6 postcode area, is the third-steepest residential street in England, with a gradient of 16.6°. The highest point in the City of Sheffield is near High Stones and Margery Hill. The city&#x27;s lowest point is just above sea level near Blackburn Meadows. However, 79% of the housing in the city is between above sea level and the highest residential street is Redmires Lane at . This variation of altitudes across Sheffield has led to frequent claims, particularly among locals, that the city was built on Seven Hills. As this claim is disputed, it likely originated as a joke referencing the Seven Hills of Rome.

Estimated to contain around 4.5 million trees, Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe and is considered to be one of the greenest cities in England and the UK, which was further reinforced when it won the 2005 Entente Florale competition. With more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens, it has over 170 woodlands (covering ), 78 public parks (covering ) and 10 public gardens. Added to the of national park and of water this means that 61% of the city is greenspace. Despite this, about 64% of Sheffield householders live further than from their nearest greenspace, although access is better in less affluent neighbourhoods across the city. Sheffield also has a very wide variety of habitat, comparing favourably with any city in the United Kingdom: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. There are six areas within the city that are designated as sites of special scientific interest.

The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former county borough of Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the Wortley Rural District. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak District National Park. No other English city had parts of a national park within its boundary, until the creation in March 2010 of the South Downs National Park, part of which lies within Brighton and Hove.
===Climate===
According to the Köppen classification, Sheffield has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) like the rest of the United Kingdom. The uplands of the Pennines to the west can create a cool, gloomy and wet environment, but they also provide shelter from the prevailing westerly winds, casting a &quot;rain shadow&quot; across the area. Between 1971 and 2000 Sheffield averaged of rain per year; December was the wettest month with and July the driest with . July was also the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of . The highest temperature ever recorded in the city of Sheffield was , on 19 July 2022. The average minimum temperature in January and February was , though the lowest temperatures recorded in these months can be between , although since 1960, the temperature has never fallen below , suggesting that urbanisation around the Weston Park site during the second half of the 20th century may prevent temperatures below occurring.

The coldest temperature to be recorded was in 2010. (Note: The official Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which can also be viewed at Sheffield Central Library, has the temperature at , recorded on 20 December, and states that to be the lowest December temperature since 1981.) The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city of Sheffield at Weston Park, since records began in 1882, is , registered in February 1895. The lowest daytime maximum temperature in the city since records began is , also recorded in February 1895. More recently, was recorded as a daytime maximum at Weston Park, on 20 December 2010 (from the Weston Park Weather Station statistics, which also can be viewed at Sheffield Central Library.) On average, through the winter months of December to March, there are 67 days during which ground frost occurs.
The Weston Park Weather station, established in 1882, is one of the longest running weather stations in the United Kingdom. It has recorded weather for more than 125 years, and a 2008 report showed that the climate of Sheffield is warming faster than it has at any time during this period, with 1990 and 2006 being the hottest years on record. In collaboration with the Stockholm Environment Institute, Sheffield developed a carbon footprint (based on 2004–05 consumption figures) of 5,798,361 tonnes per year. This compares to the UK&#x27;s total carbon footprint of 698,568,010 tonnes per year. The factors with the greatest impact are housing (34%), transport (25%), consumer (11%), private services (9%), public services (8%), food (8%) and capital investment (5%). Sheffield City Council has signed up to the 10:10 campaign.

===Green belt===

Sheffield is within a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns and areas in the Sheffield built-up area conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building. The main urban area and larger villages of the borough are exempt from the green belt area, but surrounding smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas are &#x27;washed over&#x27; with the designation. A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure interests, with many rural landscape features and facilities included.

===Subdivisions===

Sheffield is made up of many suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or hamlets that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew. These historical areas are largely ignored by the modern administrative and political divisions of the city; instead it is divided into 28 electoral wards, with each ward generally covering 4–6 areas. These electoral wards are grouped into six parliamentary constituencies. Sheffield is largely unparished, but Bradfield and Ecclesfield have parish councils, and Stocksbridge has a town council.

==Demographics==
The United Kingdom Census 2001 reported a resident population for Sheffield of 513,234, a 2% decline from the 1991 census. The city is part of the wider Sheffield urban area, which had a population of 640,720. In 2011 the racial composition of Sheffield&#x27;s population was 84% White (81% White British, 0.5% White Irish, 0.1% Romani or Irish Traveller, 2.3% Other White), 2.4% of mixed race (1.0% White and Black Caribbean, 0.2% White and Black African, 0.6% White and Asian, 0.6% Other Mixed), 8% Asian (1.1% Indian, 4% Pakistani, 0.6% Bangladeshi, 1.3% Chinese, 1.0% Other Asian), 3.6% Black (2.1% African, 1% Caribbean, 0.5% Other Black), 1.5% Arab and 0.7% of other ethnic heritage. In terms of religion, 53% of the population are Christian, 6% are Muslim, 0.6% are Hindu, 0.4% are Buddhist, 0.2% are Sikh, 0.1% are Jewish, 0.4% belong to another religion, 31% have no religion and 7% did not state their religion. The largest quinary group is 20- to 24-year-olds (9%) because of the large university student population.

The Industrial Revolution served as a catalyst for considerable population growth and demographic change in Sheffield. Large numbers of people were driven to the city as the cutlery and steel industries flourished. The population continued to grow until the mid-20th century, at which point, due to industrial decline, the population began to contract. However, by the early 21st century, the population had begun to grow once again.

The population of Sheffield peaked in 1951 at 577,050, and has since declined steadily. However, the mid-2007 population estimate was 530,300, representing an increase of about 17,000 residents since 2001.

Although a city, Sheffield is informally known as &quot;the largest village in England&quot;, because of a combination of topographical isolation and demographic stability. It is relatively geographically isolated, being cut off from other places by a ring of hills. Local folklore insists that, like Rome, Sheffield was built &quot;on seven hills&quot;. The land surrounding Sheffield was unsuitable for industrial use, and now includes several protected green belt areas. These topographical factors have served to restrict urban spread, resulting in a relatively stable population size and a low degree of mobility.

==Economy==


After many years of decline, the Sheffield economy is going through a strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. This can be seen in a surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul&#x27;s Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects completed under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6 billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2 billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).

The &quot;UK Cities Monitor 2008&quot; placed Sheffield among the top ten &quot;best cities to locate a business today&quot;, the city occupying third and fourth places, respectively, for best office location and best new call centre location. The same report places Sheffield in third place regarding &quot;greenest reputation&quot; and second in terms of the availability of financial incentives.

=== Heavy industries and metallurgy ===

Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. The earliest official record of cutlery production, for which Sheffield is particularly well known, is from 1297 when a tax return for &#x27;Robert the Cutler&#x27; was submitted. A key reason for Sheffield&#x27;s success in the production of cutlery lies in its geographic makeup. The abundance of streams in the area provided water power and the geological formations in the Hope Valley, in particular, provided sufficient grit stones for grinding wheels. In the 17th century, the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, which oversaw the booming cutlery industry in the area and remains to this day, was established and focused on markets outside the Sheffield area, leading to the gradual establishment of Sheffield as a respected producer of cutlery. this gradually developed from a national reputation into an international one.

Playing a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution, the city became an industrial powerhouse in the 18th century, and was dubbed &quot;Steel City&quot;. Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer&#x27;s invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18th century.

Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, bringing affordable cutlery to the masses. The work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park, situated just over the boundary in the borough of Rotherham, by Sheffield&#x27;s universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), Rolls-Royce plc and McLaren Automotive.

 Forgemasters, founded in 1805, is the sole remaining independent steel works in the world and dominates the north-east of Sheffield around the Lower Don Valley. The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and castings and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarines. The firm also has the capacity for pouring the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities. In July 2021 Forgemasters was bought outright by the UK Ministry of Defence for £2.56 million, with the intention of investing a further £400 million over the next decade. The decision was based on the important role Forgemasters plays in the construction of the UK nuclear submarine fleet as well other vessels for the Royal Navy.

While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, coal mining has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone from quarries in the nearby village of Anston.

=== Public sector ===

Sheffield has a large public sector workforce, numbering 77,500 workers. During the period 1995–2008 (a period of growth for the city and many others in the UK), the number of jobs in the city increased by 22% and 50% of these were in the public sector. Major public sector employers include the National Health Service, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam University, and numerous government departments and agencies including the Home Office (Visas &amp; Immigration), Department for Education &amp; Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills. Recently developed offices in St Paul&#x27;s Place and Riverside Exchange play host to the aforementioned government departments.

Sheffield City Council, which is also a major public sector employer in the city, employs over 8,000 people, spread across four different sections (known as portfolios). Sheffield City Council is also the Local Education Authority (LEA) and as such manages all states schools and their associated staff. As part of its mandate to provide public services, Sheffield City Council maintains contracts with three private contractors—Amey, Veolia and Capita (contract ending in 2020). Together, these contractors provide additional employment in the city.

=== Leisure and retail ===

==== City centre ====

Sheffield is a major retail centre, and is home to many high street and department stores as well as designer boutiques. The main shopping areas in the city centre are on The Moor precinct, Fargate, Orchard Square and the Devonshire Quarter. Department stores in the city centre include Marks and Spencer and Atkinsons. Sheffield&#x27;s main market was once Castle Market, built above the remains of the castle. This has since been demolished. Sheffield Moor Market opened in 2013 and became the main destination for fresh produce. The market has 196 stalls and includes local and organic produce, as well as international fusion cuisine such as Russian, Jamaican and Thai. In March 2021 it was announced that the Sheffield branch of John Lewis would close due to falling sales and a move to online shopping, which had increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. John Lewis received £3 million of public funding from Sheffield City Council in 2020 to keep the local store open. The local Debenhams branches are expected to re-open after the lifting of the 2021 COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, but only to clear existing stock, after which it is expected the stores will close.

With the decline in high street shopping around the UK, efforts have been made to rejuvenate Sheffield City Centre and improve the retail and leisure offering. Major developments include Leopold Square, The Moor, St Paul&#x27;s Place (a mixed use development) and the Heart of the City I &amp; II projects. In March 2022 Sheffield City Council announced that a new leisure hub would be constructed at the southern end of Fargate. The £300,000 hub will feature cafes, shops and large-screen TVs for sports events. The development is also related to other efforts to rejuvenate the Fargate area, such as a new mixed-use events and coworking hub at 20–26 Fargate, also overseen by Sheffield City Council.

==== Shopping centres ====
Meadowhall shopping centre, located to the north-east of Sheffield close to the boundary with Rotherham and next to the M1 motorway, is a major regional shopping destination and currently ranked eleventh largest in the UK with a floorspace of . Attracting over 30 million visitors a year (up from 19 million in its first year), the centre hosts 270 shops, 37 restaurants and a cinema. Many nationally renowned brands have a presence at the centre including Marks &amp; Spencer, Hugo Boss and Jaeger. The centre is connected to the city centre by rail, Supertram and bus services. Prior to the opening of Meadowhall, the site was occupied for East Hecla (steel) works, a major employer in the north-east of the city. The opening of Meadowhall in 1990 marked the beginning of major rejuvenation in the Lower Don Valley as the steel industry contracted. In a 2010 survey of forecast expenditure at retail centres in the United Kingdom, Meadowhall was ranked 12th and Sheffield City Centre 19th.

To the South of Meadowhall shopping centre is Meadowhall Retail Park, a retail park with 13 retail and food units. Next to the retail park is the Sheffield IKEA store, opened in 2017. The opening ceremony was attended by dignitaries including the Swedish Ambassador to the UK. The Sheffield store was the 20th opened in the UK and led to the creation of 480 new local jobs.

The second-largest shopping centre in Sheffield is Crystal Peaks, located in the south-east of the city, alongside Drakehouse Retail Park. Both the shopping centre and the retail park opened in 1988 and now attract around 11 million visitors a year. In total there are 101 retailers (including eateries) at Crystal Peaks and Drakehouse, including a range of high street brands. Crystal Peaks also includes a travel interchange which serves as the hub for bus travel in the east and south-east of Sheffield.

==== Suburbs ====

Beyond the city centre there are numerous other leisure and shopping areas. To the south-west of the city centre is Ecclesall Road, a major thoroughfare connecting the south-western suburbs to the city centre and lined with bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as housing. The area has a large student community owing to the presence of the Sheffield Hallam University Collegiate Campus adjacent to Ecclesall Road. The leisure section of the road is approximately long, with the south-western end becoming Ecclesall Road South and a predominantly
residential area. Another popular shopping and leisure area is London Road, to the south of the city centre. The road is famous for its multicultural community which has led to an abundance of international cuisines being served at restaurants along the road. To the west of the city centre is Broomhill, a student-centric neighbourhood which also caters for school students as well local university students and NHS staff. To the north-west of the city centre are Hillsborough, a large retail and sports hub, and Stocksbridge Fox Valley, a modern leisure and retail centre built on a brownfield industrial site.

In the late 2010s and early 2020s several new developments began to the north of the city centre in the Kelham Island Quarter, an increasingly popular mixed-use development. The area has become known for its independent cafes, restaurants and pubs and has seen significant residential development in recent years.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism plays a major role in the city&#x27;s economy on account of numerous attractions—namely the Peak District, sports events (in particular, the Snooker World Championships) and musical festivals (such as Tramlines). In 2019, the tourism industry in Sheffield was valued at £1.36 billion and supported 15,000 jobs.

In 2012, Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone was launched to promote development in a number of sites in Sheffield and across the wider region. In March 2014 additional sites were added to the zone.

==Transport==
===Cars, coaches and cycling===

Motorways near the city are the M1 and M18. Sheffield Parkway connects the city centre to the motorways. The M1 skirts the city&#x27;s north-east and crossing Tinsley Viaduct near Rotherham. The M18 branches from the M1 close to Sheffield, linking the city with Doncaster and ending at Goole.
The A57 and A61 roads are the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south, respectively, crossing in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An inner ring road, mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south-east and north, nearer the edge of the city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.
Sheffield Interchange is the city&#x27;s bus main hub; other bus stations are at Halfway, Hillsborough and Meadowhall. After deregulation in 1986, there were multiple new service providers. Current providers are First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, is the largest bus operator. There is also the Bus Rapid Transit North route between Sheffield and Maltby via Rotherham. It was planned as two routes: the Northern route to Rotherham via Meadowhall and Templeborough, and the southern route via the developing employment centre and Waverley. The northern route opened in September 2016; it involved an 800-metre Tinsley Road Link to be built between Meadowhall and the A6178 road. Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and the parent company Yorkshire Traction formerly operated in the city and were taken-over by Stagecoach Sheffield. Stagecoach Group also operates the Supertram and has an integrated ticketing system with buses and tram.

Coach services running through Sheffield are operated by National Express and to a lesser extent Megabus and Flixbus. National Express services call at Sheffield Interchange, Meadowhall Interchange and Meadowhead Bus Stop. Megabus and Flixbus services only call at Meadowhall. National Express services 564, 560, 350, 320, 310 and 240 call at Sheffield, as do others on a less frequent basis. The 560/564 service is a direct connection to London Victoria Coach Station via Chesterfield and Milton Keynes, operating 12 times a day in both directions. The 350 and 240 services connect Sheffield to Manchester Airport and Heathrow/Gatwick Airports, respectively. Two Megabus services, the M12 and M20, call at Sheffield en route to London from Newcastle upon Tyne and Inverness, respectively.

Although hilly, Sheffield is compact and has few major trunk roads, therefore cycling in Sheffield is a popular method of transport. It is on the Trans-Pennine Trail, a National Cycle Network route running from west to east from Southport in Merseyside to Hornsea in the East Riding of Yorkshire and north to south from Leeds in West Yorkshire to Chesterfield in Derbyshire. There are many cycle routes going along country paths in the woods surrounding the city, and an increasing number of cycle lanes in the city itself.

===Trams, trains and tramtrains===

Train services in Sheffield are operated by East Midlands Railway, CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern. Major railway routes through Sheffield station include the Midland Main Line (to London via the East Midlands), the Cross Country Route (which runs between eastern Scotland and south-west England) and the lines linking Liverpool and Manchester with and East Anglia. With the redevelopment of London St Pancras completed, Sheffield has a direct connection to continental Europe, via the East Midlands Railway, to St Pancras and the Eurostar to France and Belgium. East Midlands Railway also operates three premium trains: the &quot;Master Cutler&quot;, the &quot;Sheffield Continental&quot; and the &quot;South Yorkshireman&quot;.

High Speed 2 had been planned to serve a city centre station in Sheffield as a spur from the main eastern HS2 line. It was scheduled to be operational by 2033, with four trains an hour, reducing journey times to London and Birmingham to 1 hour 19 minutes and 48 minutes, respectively. In November 2021, the UK government published the &quot;Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands&quot; which announced HS2&#x27;s eastern spur route (between the East Midlands and Leeds, including Sheffield) had been cancelled. The document announced upgrades to the Midland Mainline, with HS2 trains able to run on this upgraded and electrified route.

There are several local rail routes running along the city&#x27;s valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. These local routes include the Penistone Line, the Dearne Valley Line, the Hope Valley Line and the Hallam Line. As well as the main stations of Sheffield and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations at Chapeltown, Darnall, Woodhouse and Dore &amp; Totley. As part of improvements to rail services along the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester, a new platform, station facilities and track are being built at Dore &amp; Totley Station with the expanded station due to open in 2023.
The Sheffield Supertram (not derived from the previous tramways), opened in 1994 and was operated by Stagecoach. The opening was shortly after the similar Metrolink scheme in Greater Manchester. The Supertram network consists of of track and four lines (with all lines running via the city centre): from Halfway to Malin Bridge (Blue Line), from Meadowhall to Middlewood (Yellow Line), from Cathedral to Herdings Park (Purple Line), and the from Cathedral to Rotherham Parkgate (Black Line). The system contains both on-street and segregated running, depending upon the section and line. The Black Line opened in 2018, with &quot;tram-trains&quot;; these are trams that are able to share a line with conventional heavy rail trains between Sheffield and Rotherham.

In March 2024, control of the network passed to the South Yorkshire Combined Mayoral Authority.

===Canal===
The Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire Navigation (S&amp;SY) is a system of navigable inland waterways (canals and canalised rivers) in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Chiefly based on the River Don, it runs for a length of and has 29 locks. It connects Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster with the River Trent at Keadby and (via the New Junction Canal) the Aire &amp; Calder Navigation. The terminus of the canal is at Victoria Quays, a redevelopment mixed-used area adjacent to Park Square in Sheffield City Centre.

===Air===
The closest airports are in Leeds Bradford, Humberside, East Midlands (within an hour&#x27;s drive of the city), Manchester (hourly direct service by TransPennine Express).

Due to the topographical nature of the city, Sheffield was not served by its own airport. In May 1990, Sheffield Development Corporation entered into an agreement with A. F. Budge (Mining) Ltd for the construction and operation of the airport and the development of adjacent land. In 1997, Sheffield City Airport was opened on land close to the M1 and the Sheffield Parkway. The airport was operated on STOLPORT model similar to London City Airport and operated a limited range of short range business focused flights to destinations in the British Isles and the Netherlands. The airport fell into decline with the growth of low cost airlines in the late 1990s and the last scheduled flight took place in 2002. The airport closed and lost its Civil Aviation Authority license in 2008.

Doncaster Sheffield Airport (also known as Robin Hood Airport) then became the closest international airport to Sheffield, located from the city centre. It opened on 28 April 2005 on the former RAF Finningley site and was served mainly by charter and budget airlines, with about one million passengers a year. Destinations had included the Canary Islands, Balearics, Greece, Turkey, Poland and the Baltic countries with TUI Airways and Wizz Air operating from the airport. A link road, called the Great Yorkshire Way, connects Doncaster Sheffield Airport to the M18 motorway, reducing the journey time from Sheffield city centre from 40 to 25 minutes. The airport closed in 2022. In June 2023 South Yorkshire&#x27;s mayor Oliver Coppard handed Doncaster council £3.1 million to help the council build a case for legal action in pursuit of a compulsory purchase order, which it believes will cost up to £6.25 million.

==Education==
Within the city of Sheffield there are two universities, 141 primary schools and 28 secondary schools.

===Museums===
Sheffield&#x27;s museums are managed by two distinct organisations. Museums Sheffield manages the Weston Park Museum (a Grade II* listed Building), Millennium Galleries and Graves Art Gallery. These museums constitute the oldest extant museums in the city, with Graves Art Gallery and Weston Park Museum being gifted to the city by industrialist philanthropists in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Millennium Galleries, being established in the early 2000s, is one of the newest museums and constitutes part of the Heart of the City development, connecting directly to the Winter Garden and Millennium Square. All three museums host a broad range of exhibits which reflect Sheffield&#x27;s history and numerous other themes, including exhibitions on loan from other major galleries and museums.

Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust manages the museums dedicated to Sheffield&#x27;s industrial heritage of which there are three. Kelham Island Museum (located just to the North of the city centre) is located on the site of a 19th-century iron foundry and showcases the city&#x27;s history of steel manufacturing and includes a range of important historical artifacts, including a preserved Bessemer Converter (which won an Engineering Heritage Award in 2004 from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers), munitions and mechanical components from WW2 aircraft (Including a crankshaft from a Spitfire which, during the early stages of the war, could only be produced in Sheffield) and a fully functional 12,000 horsepower steam engine dating to the 19th century. The museum is an Anchor Point for the ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet (in the south of the city) is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Shepherd Wheel (in the south-East of the city) is a former water-powered grinding workshop, Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Also there are Sheffield Archives.

In August 2022 the Yorkshire Natural History Museum opened on Holme Lane in Sheffield. Many of the exhibits come from the collection of James Hogg and feature a collection of Jurassic marine life, such as ammonites, belemnites, plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, many of which were collected from the Lias of the Yorkshire Coast. The museum has Europe&#x27;s first publicly accessible fossil preparation and conservation laboratory with ultrasonic preparation facilities, an acid preparation laboratory, 3D scanning, CT scanning and 3D printing. On the opening day palaeontologist Dean Lomax exmined one of the fossils on display and declared it to be the oldest example of a vertebrate embryo found in Britain and the oldest complete ichthyosaur embryo ever found in Britain.

There are also a number of independent museums in the city including the National Videogame Museum and the National Emergency Services Museum, as well as the University of Sheffield&#x27;s Turner Museum of Glass.

===Universities, colleges and UTCs===
The city&#x27;s universities are the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. The two combined bring about 60,000 students to the city every year. The University of Sheffield is the city&#x27;s oldest university. It was established in 1897 as University College Sheffield and gained university status in 1905. Its history traces back to Sheffield Medical School found in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. The university is one of the original red brick universities and is a member of the Russell Group.

Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a university on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus is located in the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and Collegiate Crescent Campus is about away, adjacent to Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. Sheffield Hallam University&#x27;s history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.

Sheffield has three main further education providers: The Sheffield College, Longley Park Sixth Form and Chapeltown Academy. The Sheffield College is organised on a federal basis and was originally created from the merger of six colleges around the city: Sheffield City (formerly Castle), Olive Grove and Eyre Street near the city centre, Hillsborough and Fir Vale, serving the north of the city and Peaks to the south.

Launched by the coalition government in 2010, the University Technical College program was designed to foster greater interest in STEM subjects amongst students aged 14 to 18. Sheffield currently hosts two UTCs, UTC Sheffield City Centre and UTC Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park. All UTCs, including those in Sheffield, are sponsored by the Baker Dearing Educational Trust, established by Lord Baker. The two UTCs in Sheffield are also sponsored and supported by Sheffield Hallam University. Whilst the UTCs are equivalent to regular secondary schools and sixth forms, their governance structure and curriculum are different, owing to their status as free schools and focusing on STEM, as opposed to a broader curriculum.

===Secondary, primary and nursery===
There are 137 primary schools, 26 secondary schools—of which 10 have sixth forms: (High Storrs, King Ecgberts, King Edward VII, Silverdale, Meadowhead, Tapton, Notre Dame Catholic High and All Saints Catholic High)—and a sixth-form college, Longley Park Sixth Form. The city&#x27;s five independent private schools include Birkdale School and the Sheffield High School. There are also 12 special schools and a number of Integrated Resource Units in mainstream schools which are, along with all other schools, managed by Sheffield City Council. All schools are non-selective, mixed sex schools (apart from Sheffield High School and Al-Mahad Al-Islami, both all-girls schools). The Early Years Education and Childcare Service of Sheffield City Council manages 32 nurseries and children&#x27;s centres in the city.

==Religion==

==Sport==
===Football===
Sheffield has a long sporting heritage, and the city claims to be the birthplace of professional association football. In 1857 a collective of cricketers formed the world&#x27;s first-ever official football club, Sheffield F.C., and the world&#x27;s second-ever, Hallam F.C., who also play at the world&#x27;s oldest football ground in the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield&#x27;s two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby Dronfield, Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what has become known as the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15 football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions taking place in the city.

Sheffield is best known for its two professional football teams, Sheffield United, nicknamed &quot;The Blades&quot;, and Sheffield Wednesday, nicknamed &quot;The Owls&quot;. United, who play at Bramall Lane south of the city centre and Wednesday, who play at Hillsborough in the north-west of the city, both compete in the EFL Championship for the 2024–25 season. The two clubs contest the Steel City Derby, which is considered by many to be one of the most fierce football rivalries in English Football.

In the pre-war era, both Wednesday and United enjoyed large amounts of success and found themselves two of the country&#x27;s top clubs; Sheffield Wednesday have been champions of the Football League four times—in 1902–03, 1903–04, 1928–29 and 1929–30, whilst Sheffield United have won it once, in 1897–98. During the 1970s and early 1980s the two sides fell from grace, with Wednesday finding themselves in the Third Division by the mid-70s and United as far as the Fourth Division in 1981. Wednesday once again became one of England&#x27;s high-flying clubs following promotion back to the First Division in 1984, winning the League Cup in 1991, competing in the UEFA Cup in 1992–93, and reaching the final of both the League Cup and FA Cup in the same season.

United and Wednesday were both founding members of the FA Premier League in 1992, but The Blades were relegated in 1994. The Owls remained until 2000. Both clubs had gone into decline in the 21st  century, Wednesday twice relegated to League One and United suffering the same fate in 2011, despite a brief spell in the Premier League in 2006–07. United was promoted to the Premier League in 2019 under manager, and Sheffield United Fan, Chris Wilder. Despite being written off by most football pundits, and declared favourites for relegation from the Premier League, United exceeded expectations and finished in the top half of the table in the 2019–20 season. In the 2020–21 season, United sat at the bottom of the Premier League table by the conclusion of the season and were relegated.

Sheffield was the site of the deadliest sports venue disaster in the United Kingdom, the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, when 97 Liverpool supporters were killed in a stampede and crush during an FA Cup semi-final at the venue.

Rotherham United, who play in the Championship, did play their home games in the city between 2008 and 2012, having moved to play at Sheffield&#x27;s Don Valley Stadium in 2008 following a dispute with their previous landlord at their traditional home ground of Millmoor, Rotherham. However, in July 2012, the club moved to the new 12,000 seat New York Stadium in Rotherham. There are also facilities for golf, climbing and bowling, as well as a newly inaugurated national ice-skating arena (IceSheffield).

===Rugby===

Sheffield Eagles RLFC are the city&#x27;s professional rugby league team and play their matches at Sheffield Olympic Legacy Stadium. They currently play in the second tier of the professional league, the Championship and won back to back titles in 2012 and 2013. Their most successful moment came in 1998, when, against all the odds they defeated Wigan in the Challenge Cup final, despite being huge underdogs. The team then hit troubled times before reforming in 2003. Since then they have played their rugby in the Championship (second tier). In 2011, they made the playoffs finishing in fifth place. They made the Grand Final, by defeating Leigh, who were huge favourites in a playoff semi final. In the final, they were comprehensively beaten by Featherstone Rovers. Sheffield also put in a bid to be a host city for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, but their bid was unsuccessful.

===Other Sports===
Sheffield has a number of field hockey clubs that compete in the Men&#x27;s England Hockey League, the Women&#x27;s England Hockey League, the North Hockey League, the Yorkshire Hockey Association League and the BUCS leagues.

Ponds Forge is also the home of Sheffield City Swimming Club, a local swimming club competing in the Speedo league. The former Don Valley International Athletics Stadium, once the largest athletics stadium in the UK, was also constructed for the Universiade games.

Following the closure and demolition of Don Valley Stadium in 2013, The Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park was established and constructed on the same site, adjacent to the English Institute for Sport. The park is designed to a collaborative project with input from numerous stakeholders including both universities in Sheffield, the English Institute of Sport Sheffield, the NHS and private medical companies. A key part of this collaboration is Sheffield Hallam University&#x27;s £14 million Advanced Well-being Research Centre (AWRC), which was established along similar lines to the University of Sheffield&#x27;s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre&#x27;s (AMRC&#x27;s). The site also includes teaching facilities, a stadium and research &amp; innovation facilities.

The Sheffield Ski Village was the largest artificial ski resort in Europe, before being destroyed in a series of suspected arson attacks in 2012 and 2013. The city also has six indoor climbing centres and is home to a significant community of professional climbers, including Britain&#x27;s most successful competitive climber Shauna Coxsey. Sheffield was the UK&#x27;s first National City of Sport and is now home to the English Institute of Sport – Sheffield, where British athletes trained for the 2012 Olympics.

Sheffield also has close ties with snooker, with the city&#x27;s Crucible Theatre being the venue for the World Snooker Championships. The English Institute of Sport hosts most of the top fencing competitions each year, including the National Championships for Seniors, Juniors (U20&#x27;s) and Cadets (U17&#x27;s) as well as the 2011 Senior European Fencing Championships.

==Landmarks and parks==

Weston Park Museum is a museum telling the stories of Sheffield and its people. The museum was originally opened in 1875.

Bishops&#x27; House was built in 1500 and is a Grade II listed building which is now a museum.

The Sheffield Walk of Fame in the City Centre honours famous Sheffield residents past and present in a similar way to the Hollywood version. Sheffield also had its own Ferris Wheel known as the Wheel of Sheffield, located atop Fargate shopping precinct. The Wheel was dismantled in October 2010 and moved to London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

Heeley City Farm and Graves Park are home to Sheffield&#x27;s two farm animal collections, both of which are fully open to the public. Sheffield also has its own zoo; the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife &amp; Falconry Centre.

There are about 1,100 listed buildings in Sheffield (including the whole of the Sheffield postal district). Of these, only five are Grade I listed. Sixty-seven are Grade II*, but the overwhelming majority are listed as Grade II. Compared to other English cities, Sheffield has few buildings with the highest Grade I listing: Liverpool, for example, has 26 Grade I listed buildings. This situation led the noted architecture historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in 1959, to comment that the city was &quot;architecturally a miserable disappointment&quot;, with no pre-19th-century buildings of any distinction. By contrast, in November 2007, Sheffield&#x27;s Peace and Winter Gardens beat London&#x27;s South Bank to gain the Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; Academy of Urbanism &quot;Great Place&quot; Award, as an &quot;outstanding example of how cities can be improved, to make urban spaces as attractive and accessible as possible&quot;. In the summer of 2016 a public art event across the city occurred called the Herd of Sheffield which raised £410,000 for the Sheffield Children&#x27;s Hospital.

===Greenspace===

Sheffield has a reputed 4.5 million trees and is considered to be one of the greenest cities in England and the UK. There are many parks and woods throughout the city and beyond. Containing more than 250 parks, woodlands and gardens, there are around 78 public parks and 10 public gardens in Sheffield, including 83 managed parks (13 &#x27;City&#x27; Parks, 20 &#x27;District&#x27; Parks and 50 &#x27;Local&#x27; Parks) located throughout the city. Included in the city parks category are 3 of Sheffield&#x27;s 6 public gardens (the Sheffield Botanical Gardens, the Peace Gardens and Hillsborough Walled Gardens, with the Sheffield Winter Gardens, Beauchief Gardens and Lynwood Gardens being the separate entities).

The Sheffield Botanical Gardens are on a 19-acre site located to the south-west of the city centre and date back to 1836. The site includes a large, Grade II listed, Victorian era glasshouse. The Peace Gardens, neighboured next to the Town Hall and forming part of the Heart of the City project, occupy a site in the centre of the city. The site is dominated by its water features, principal among which is the Goodwin Fountain. Made up of 89 individual jets of water, this fountain lies at the corner of the quarter-circle shaped Peace Gardens and is named after Stuart Goodwin, a notable Sheffield industrialist. Since their redevelopment in 1998, the Peace gardens have received a number of regional and national accolades. Hillsborough Walled Garden is located in Hillsborough Park, to the north-west of the city centre. The gardens date back to 1779 and have been dedicated to the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster since the redevelopment of the gardens in the early 1990s. The Winter Garden, lying within the Heart of the City, is a large wood framed, glass skinned greenhouse housing some 2,500 plants from around the world.

Also within the city there are a number of nature reserves which when combined occupy of land. There are also 170 woodland areas within the city, 80 of which are classed as ancient.

The south-west boundary of the city overlaps with the Peak District National Park, the first national park in England (est. 1951). As a consequence, several communities actually reside within both entities. The Peak District is home to many notable, natural, features and also human-made features such as Chatsworth House, the setting for the BBC series &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Sheffield City Council has created a new chain of parks spanning the hillside behind Sheffield Station. The park, known as Sheaf Valley Park, has an open-air amphitheatre and will include an arboretum. The site was once home to a medieval deer park, latterly owned by the Duke of Norfolk.

===Theatres===

Sheffield has two large theatres, the Lyceum Theatre and the Crucible Theatre, which together with the smaller Studio Theatre make up the largest theatre complex outside London, located in Tudor Square. The Crucible Theatre, a grade II listed building, is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships, which sees most of Tudor Square and the adjoining Winter Garden used for side events, and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year from local, national and international performance groups. The theatre was awarded the Barclays &#x27;Theatre of the Year Award&#x27; in 2001. Between 2007 and 2009, the theatre underwent a £15 million refurbishment during which time major internal and external improvements were carried out. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has the Montgomery Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located a short distance from Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street. There are also a large number of smaller amateur theatres scattered throughout the city.

==Culture and Community==

Sheffield has a number of pubs throughout the city. West Street, running through the heart of the West End district of the city centre, is home to pubs, bars and clubs and attracts student visitors. Recent additions to the city&#x27;s leisure scene include Leopold Square, situated just off the northern end of West Street and Millennium Square, which are home to several restaurants offering international cuisine. Aagrah, an Indian restaurant in the square which serves Kashmiri cuisine, was prior to 2014 voted &quot;Best Restaurant Group in the UK&quot; at the British Curry Awards.
Sheffield was once home to a number of historically important nightclubs in the early dance music scene of the 1980s and 1990s, Gatecrasher One was one of the most popular clubs in the North of England until its destruction by fire on 18 June 2007.
Sheffield has a thriving poetry and spoken word scene: from Wordlife&#x27;s events across the city to the sustained work of Sheffield Authors; from the vibrant monthly arts night, Verse Matters, at the Moor Theatre Deli to the longstanding work of The Poetry Business, there are always opportunities for new and experienced writers to get writing and to share their work.
The city is home to thirteen morris dance teams—thought to be one of the highest concentration of sides in the country. Nearly all forms of the dance are represented in the city, including Cotswold (Five Rivers Morris, Pecsaetan Morris, Harthill Morris, Lord Conyer&#x27;s Morris Men, Sheffield City Morris, William Morris), border (Boggart&#x27;s Breakfast), North West (Yorkshire Chandelier, Silkstone Greens, Lizzie Dripping), rapper (Sheffield Steel Rapper) and Longsword.
Sheffield hosts a number of festivals, including the Festival of Debate, the Grin Up North Sheffield Comedy Festival, the Sensoria Music &amp; Film Festival and the Tramlines Festival.

===Music===

The Tramlines Festival was launched as an annual music festival in 2009, it is held at Hillsborough Park (the main stage) and at venues throughout Sheffield City Centre, and features local and national artists.

A number of major music acts, including Joe Cocker, Ace, Def Leppard, Paul Carrack, Arctic Monkeys, Bring Me the Horizon, 65daysofstatic, Rolo Tomassi, While She Sleeps, Pulp and Moloko, hail from the city. Indie band the Long Blondes originated from the city, as part of what the &quot;NME&quot; dubbed the New Yorkshire scene.

Sheffield has been home to several bands and musicians, with a number of synth-pop and other electronic bands originating from the city. These included the Human League, Heaven 17, ABC, Thompson Twins and the more industrially inclined Cabaret Voltaire and Clock DVA. This electronic tradition has continued: techno label Warp Records was a central pillar of the Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass scene of the early 1990s, and has gone on to become one of the UK&#x27;s oldest and best-loved dance music labels. More recently, other popular genres of electronic music such as bassline house have originated in the city.

In 1999 the National Centre for Popular Music, a museum dedicated to the subject of popular music, was opened in the city. It was not as successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the students&#x27; union for Sheffield Hallam University. Live music venues in the city include Leadmill, the Boardwalk, The Cremorne, Corporation, the City Hall, the University of Sheffield Students&#x27; Union, the Studio Theatre at the Crucible Theatre, the O2 Academy Sheffield and The Grapes.

The city is home to several orchestras and choirs, such as the Sheffield Symphony Orchestra, the Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra, the Sheffield Chamber Orchestra, the City of Sheffield Youth Orchestra, the Sheffield Philharmonic Chorus and the Chorus UK community choir. It is also home to Music in the Round, a charitable organisation that exists to promote chamber music.

Sheffield has a folk music, song and dance community. Singing and music sessions occur weekly in pubs around the city and it also hosts the annual Sheffield Sessions Festival. The University of Sheffield runs a number of courses and research projects dedicated to folk culture.

The tradition of singing carols in pubs around Christmas is still kept alive in the city. The Sheffield Carols, as they are known locally, predate modern carols by over a century and are sung with alternative words and verses. Although there is a core of carols that are sung at most venues, each particular place has its own mini-tradition. The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a &#x27;foreign&#x27; carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is a flip chart with the words on in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another.

Sheffield was shortlisted to host the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place between 9 and 13 May 2023 in Liverpool.

<text>Interstate 24 (I-24) is an Interstate Highway in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States. It runs diagonally from I-57, south of Marion, Illinois, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, at I-75. It travels through Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia. As an even-numbered Interstate, it is signed as an east–west route, though the route follows a more southeast–northwest routing, passing through Nashville, Tennessee. The numbering deviates from the standard Interstate Highway System grid, lying further north than its number would indicate west of Nashville. The short segment within Georgia bears the unsigned designation State Route 409 (SR 409). 

I-24 between Nashville and Chattanooga is part of a longer north–south freight corridor which runs between Chicago and Atlanta. The Interstate has facilitated the rapid growth of the largest suburban corridor in the Nashville metropolitan area, which runs for more than southeast of the city and is considered the most congested stretch of highway in the state. The stretch through Chattanooga also experiences severe congestion, due to an unusually high volume of truck traffic. The stretch of I-24 across the Cumberland Plateau, commonly known as &quot;Monteagle Mountain&quot;, is considered one of the most hazardous stretches of highway in the US, particularly for trucks, due to its steep descents, which measure a maximum of six-percent grade.

As proposed by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, the western terminus of I-24 was originally located in Nashville. Most of the route between Nashville and Chattanooga was constructed in the 1960s, with the final section opening in 1971. After extensive lobbying from local politicians, the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor agency to the Federal Highway Administration, authorized an extension of I-24 to its present-day western terminus in Pulleys Mill, Illinois, in 1964. As a result, I-24 was the last mainline Interstate Highway in Tennessee and Kentucky to be completed, with the last sections in the two states opening in 1978 and 1980, respectively.

I-24 runs diagonally from I-57 south of Marion, Illinois, to I-75 at Chattanooga, Tennessee. In Kentucky, the road passes through Paducah and Eddyville. Its length in Tennessee is longer than the other three states combined. There are two segments that are separated by the segment in Georgia. Through Georgia, it carries the unsigned State Route 409 (SR 409) designation for internal Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) purposes.

===Illinois===
I-24 begins at exit 44 on I-57 in southern Williamson County, near the community of Pulleys Mill. The highway heads southeast into rural Johnson County, bypassing Goreville to the east. It reaches an exit at Tunnel Hill Road, which serves Goreville and Tunnel Hill. The highway continues south to its next exit at US Route 45 (US 45) north of Vienna. It reaches its next exit at Illinois Route 146 (IL 146) in eastern Vienna. I-24 heads southeast from Vienna into Massac County. Its first exit in Massac County is at Big Bay Road, which serves the communities of Big Bay and New Columbia. I-24 continues southward, bypassing the community of Round Knob before entering Metropolis. The highway meets US 45 again in Metropolis and passes west of Fort Massac State Park. It leaves Metropolis and crosses the I-24 Bridge over the Ohio River. After that, it continues into Kentucky.

===Kentucky===

I-24 enters the Jackson Purchase region of western Kentucky on a north–south alignment. Immediately within McCracken County, the route begins gradually veering southeast and enters the western fringes of Paducah a few miles later. The welcome center in Paducah utilizes Whitehaven, the only historic house in the United States used as a rest area. In Paducah, the Interstate continues to shift southeast and has interchanges with US 60, US 62, and US 45. Passing through the Hendron and Farley communities adjacent to Paducah, the highway shifts into a direct east–west alignment several miles later and has an interchange with US 68 in Reidland. The route then enters Marshall County and, about later, reaches an interchange with I-69 and a connector road to US 62 and Calvert City to the north. Here, it begins a concurrency with the former. The two Interstates then shift northeast and have an interchange with US 62 about later. A short distance later, the Interstates cross the Tennessee River onto the Pennyroyal Plateau and Livingston County just north of Kentucky Dam and its Kentucky Lake impoundment. The highways then have an interchange with Kentucky Route 453 (KY 453) north of Lake City and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. They then cross the Cumberland River about later into Lyon County a few miles north of Barkley Dam and Lake Barkley. 

Gradually veering eastward, the two Interstates reach US 62 again near Kuttawa and Eddyville. Less than later, I-69 splits off to the northeast at a trumpet interchange, and I-24 passes through Mineral Mound State Park, veering southeast a few miles later. Passing through a mostly wooded area, the Interstate crosses KY 93 without an interchange, and then has an interchange with KY 293 near the Kentucky State Penitentiary. It then crosses an inlet of Lake Barkley a few miles later. Some distance later, the freeway enters a landscape consisting mostly of farmland and dips briefly into the southern tip of Caldwell County, where it has an interchange with KY 139. The Interstate then enters Trigg County and crosses the Muddy Fork Little River a short distance later. About later, the Interstate has an interchange with US 68 and KY 80 between Cadiz and Hopkinsville. The highway then crosses into Christian County a few miles later. Passing over the next several miles through additional farmland and bypassing Hopkinsville to the southwest, the Interstate reaches the southern terminus of I-169 at a trumpet interchange. About later, the Interstate has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 41 Alternate, which provides access to Hopkinsville to the north and Fort Campbell and Clarksville, Tennessee, to the south. I-24 then crosses into Tennessee about later.

===Tennessee===

====Clarksville and Western Highland Rim====
I-24 crosses into Tennessee from Kentucky traveling in a southeasterly-to-northwesterly direction into Montgomery County and serving as a major means of access to St. Louis and Chicago to the northwest. Immediately within the eastern outskirts of Clarksville, the fifth-largest city in Tennessee, the Interstate reaches an interchange with State Route 48 (SR 48), less than later, which provides access to Trenton in Kentucky to the north. About later the Interstate reaches US 79, which also provides access to Guthrie and Russellville in Kentucky to the northeast. Bypassing Clarksville to the east, the Interstate next reaches SR 237. The highway then begins a steep descent, with the westbound lanes utilizing a truck climbing lane to ascend the grade from the east. It then crosses the Red River before reaching SR 76.

Leaving Clarksville, the highway enters a long straight section with several steep grades and crosses into Robertson County a short distance later. Several miles later, the Interstate reaches an interchange with SR 49 near Pleasant View and Coopertown, which provides access to Springfield to the northeast and Ashland City to the southwest. The route then descends, utilizing another westbound truck lane, before briefly entering Cheatham County. The Interstate then crosses another steep hill over the next several miles, utilizing an eastbound truck lane before crossing into Davidson County. It then has an interchange with US 431 near the Joelton community and begins a gradual descent into the Nashville Basin, containing a westbound truck lane. Passing over the next few miles through dense woodlands, the highway reaches SR 45 (Old Hickory Boulevard) about later. Over the next beyond this point, the Interstate crosses over another steep hill, utilizing truck lanes on both the eastbound and westbound ascent before reaching Nashville at SR 155 (Briley Parkway).

====Nashville metropolitan area====

Entering Nashville, I-24 has a cloverleaf interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway), a northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. Less than later, the Interstate joins a concurrency with I-65, where the combined routes carry eight throughlanes and travel due south. About later is an interchange with US 41A/US 431 (Trinity Lane). About beyond this point, I-65 splits off and I-24 passes along the east side of downtown Nashville, where it reduces to six lanes and has interchanges with US 41, US 431, and US 31E, and passes near Nissan Stadium. The interstate then crosses the Cumberland River on the Silliman Evans Bridge and joins in a concurrency with I-40, traveling southeast-to-northwest with eight throughlanes. later, I-40 splits off eastwardly, heading toward Knoxville. Located at this interchange is also a partial interchange with US 41/US 70S (Murfreesboro Road).

Less than later is an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-440, which is also accessible from I-40 nearby. Between I-40 and I-440, I-24&#x27;s eastbound lanes are split into two barrier-separated carriageways to prevent weaving of traffic destined from I-40 to I-440. A short distance later is once again an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway/Thompson Lane) near Nashville International Airport. Beginning at the next exit, SR 255 (Harding Place), the left lanes operate as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes during rush hour. Over the next few miles, I-24 passes through the Antioch neighborhood, where it has interchanges with Haywood Lane and SR 254 (Bell Road), and crosses Mill Creek. I-24 then continues through southeast Nashville, reaching interchanges with Hickory Hollow Parkway and SR 171 (Old Hickory Boulevard).
Continuing through the southeastern suburbs of Nashville, I-24 crosses into Rutherford County about beyond. Immediately within the city of La Vergne, the Interstate has an exit with a connector road to that city. It then enters Smyrna where it first has an interchange with SR 266 (Sam Ridley Pkwy.). The Interstate then enters a long straightaway and reaches an interchange with SR 102 (Almaville Road), which also serves Smyrna and the Nissan Smyrna Assembly Plant. Leaving Smyrna, the route enters an unincorporated urban area, before reaching a three-level interchange with I-840, the outer southern beltway around Nashville. I-24 then enters Murfreesboro, the largest suburb of Nashville and sixth-largest city in Tennessee. The Interstate first has an interchange with a local thoroughfare (Medical Center Parkway/Fortress Blvd), before reaching SR 96, which also connects to Franklin. A short distance later, the Interstate crosses the west fork of the Stones River and reaches SR 99 (New Salem Highway). A short distance later, the highway reaches US 231, which also connects to Lebanon and Shelbyville. Here, the HOV lane restriction terminates, and the Interstate reduces from eight to four lanes. Leaving Murfreesboro, the Interstate later has an interchange with the Joe B. Jackson Parkway, which serves as an outer beltway around southeast Murfreesboro.

====Eastern Nashville Basin and Eastern Highland Rim====

Upon leaving Murfreesboro, I-24 enters a rural area, passing through a mix of farmland and woodlands and maintaining a straight alignment. Several miles later, the Interstate begins a gradual, largely unnoticeable, ascent out of the Nashville Basin onto the eastern Highland Rim. A few miles later, the Interstate briefly enters Bedford County and then has an interchange with SR 64, which connects to Shelbyville, near the Bedford–Coffee county line. I-24 then briefly descends, curves to the south, then the east, before once again resuming its gradual ascent, where it surpasses an elevation of for the first time in Tennessee. Upon reaching the top of the rim several miles later, the interstate has an interchange with US 41. later, the highway enters Manchester, where it crosses the Little Duck River and then has interchanges with SR 53 and SR 55 in short proximity. A short distance later, the highway reaches an interchange with US 41 once again. Leaving Manchester, the Interstate maintains its relatively straight trajectory and passes through the northeastern corner of Arnold Air Force Base over a distance of about . The Interstate then travels over the next through a wide swath of mostly farmland, before entering Grundy County and reaching an interchange with US 64 and SR 50 near the town of Pelham, where it begins a concurrency with the former route that is largely unsigned. A short distance later, I-24 crosses the Elk River, before reaching the base of the Cumberland Plateau.

====Monteagle Mountain and Cumberland Plateau gorge====

One of the most hazardous stretches of Interstate Highway in the US is located where I-24 crosses the Cumberland Plateau on steep grades in Grundy and Marion County near the town of Monteagle and is commonly known as &quot;Monteagle Mountain&quot; or &quot;Monteagle&quot;. While all motorists are advised to exercise caution along this stretch, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died in accidents along this stretch. The eastbound grade is particularly hazardous, with a protracted four-to-six-percent grade over several miles. On this stretch, I-24 is three lanes in each direction and contains two runaway truck ramps. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. The westbound downgrade of the plateau is also extremely hazardous and contains several sharp curves. Portions of this downgrade also feature offramp approach style lane dividers in order to slow motorists. Throughout the entire stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, the speed limit reduces to a maximum of and for trucks on both downgrades. At top of the Plateau, the Interstate surpasses in elevation, has interchanges with US 41A and US 41, respectively, and crosses into East Tennessee at the Grundy–Marion county line.

The eastern Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate Highway; the others are I-8 through the In-Ko-Pah grade in California and I-84 through the Cabbage Hill grade east of Pendleton, Oregon. There is more than between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the hill on one side of Monteagle Mountain as part of the original three-lane (two ascending and one descending) US 64 alignment, while the westbound lanes ascend the other side of the hill on new roadbed built for that purpose.
After descending Monteagle, I-24 travels for several miles through a vast flat gorge within the plateau characterized by long straightaways and few curves before reaching an interchange with US 72 near Kimball and South Pittsburg, where US 64 splits off. This exit is the primary means of access to Huntsville, Alabama, for motorists in East Tennessee. About later, the Interstate has an interchange with SR 28 in Jasper and crosses the Sequatchie River. Beyond this point, the east and westbound lanes split more than apart over a few miles, encompassing farms, homes, and a few businesses in between. The route then crosses a large mountain ridge, has an interchange with SR 27, and, about later, crosses the Nickajack Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River. Beyond this point, the highway travels through a narrow gorge over several miles, crossing the Running Water Creek and traveling under its namesake trestle. This stretch is extremely crooked and can experience potentially strong crosswind. The Interstate then enters Hamilton County and the Eastern Time Zone and then crosses into Georgia less than later.

===Georgia and Chattanooga===

In the state of Georgia, I-24 travels for in Dade County along the southern flank of Raccoon Mountain. Along this stretch, exits remain numbered according to Tennessee&#x27;s mileage; however, the roadway mileposts are numbered according to Georgia&#x27;s mileage. This segment also carries the unsigned SR 409 designation for internal GDOT purposes. About after entering the state, the Interstate has an interchange with the northern terminus of I-59, which provides access to Birmingham, Alabama, to the southwest. The route then shifts north and has an interchange with SR 299 in Wildwood about later before turning back north and reentering Tennessee about later.
Upon reentering Tennessee and Hamilton County, I-24 travels through Tiftonia for several miles and has an interchange with US 11/US 41/US 72 (Lee Highway) about later near the Tiftonia neighborhood. About later, the Interstate curves sharply to the east, traveling on a narrow artificial causeway between the Tennessee River to the north and the northern tip of Lookout Mountain to the south. A short distance later, the Interstate gradually curves 90 degrees to the north, entering Chattanooga. Less than later is a three-way interchange with US 27 (unsigned I-124 northbound) northbound, which provides access to downtown Chattanooga directly to the north. Forming an unsigned concurrency with US 27, the highways sharply curve 90 degrees to the east, before widening to eight lanes. I-24 then briefly dips to the south, where it has a trumpet interchange with a connector to SR 8. A short distance later, US 27 splits off to the south at a near-cloverleaf interchange as Rossville Boulevard, where the Interstate reduces to six lanes. It then travels through the south side of Chattanooga before reaching a partial interchange with US 41/US 76. Here, I-24 reaches the &quot;Ridge Cut&quot;, a stretch where the Interstate ascends Missionary Ridge on a steep grade, first curving sharply to the north at the bottom of the ascent and then to the east again at the top. This stretch is notorious for severe congestion and is especially hazardous to truckers. At the top of the Ridge Cut, the Interstate enters a straight section and begins a gradual descent over a short distance. Traveling roughly along the boundary between Chattanooga and East Ridge, the Interstate has interchanges with multiple local thoroughfares over the next several miles. It then reaches its eastern terminus with I-75 at a semi-directional T interchange, known locally as the &quot;75/24 Split&quot; or simply &quot;The Split&quot;.

==History==
A controlled-access highway between Nashville and Chattanooga was first included in the National Interregional Highway Committee&#x27;s 1944 report, titled &quot;Interregional Highways&quot;, and a subsequent 1947 plan produced by the Public Roads Administration of the now-defunct Federal Works Agency.
The route was subsequently part of the original of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, commonly known as the Interstate Highway Act. The numbering was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on August 14, 1957. While most of the routing of I-24 proved was chosen without difficulty, the mountainous topography of the Chattanooga area posed a challenged to planners. The route was initially slated to pass near 38th Street through the Alton Park and East Lake neighborhoods, but was moved approximately north in August 1955. The route was also planned to pass through a tunnel under Missionary Ridge until October 1960, when planners announced that a deep and wide cut would be made through the ridge. Engineers also initially recommended that the Interstate cross the Tennessee River onto Moccasin Bend south of downtown, and then again cross the river into Lookout Valley a short distance beyond, but this was rejected by the Bureau of Public Roads in April 1958 as too expensive.
In 1957, officials in Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri began an effort to extend I-24 west of its allocated western terminus in Nashville to St. Louis; however, each of the states had difficulty reaching an agreement on the proposed routing. Eventually, the debate evolved into two proposed alignments for the extension in Tennessee. The first alignment extended I-24 west of Nashville into Kentucky near Clarksville, and the second would have had I-24 run concurrent with I-40 west of Nashville for about to near Dickson, before splitting off to the northwest and crossing the Kentucky Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River a few miles before entering Kentucky. This latter alignment was favored by many officials in Tennessee and Western Kentucky, but the federal government preferred the former, due to its proximity to Fort Campbell.

On September 17, 1963, the governors of the four states in a meeting with President John F. Kennedy reached an agreement on the alignment, which included the Nashville-to-Clarksville alignment in Tennessee and extended the route&#x27;s western terminus to Pulleys Mill, Illinois. The four governors also urged the approval of a new east–west Interstate Highway to run between Hayti, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee, incorporating a then-unbuilt bridge across the Mississippi River that had been proposed since the early 1940s. On August 18, 1964, the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor agency to the Federal Highway Administration, approved the I-24 extension; however, they only authorized the westernmost of the route between Missouri and Tennessee, which was designated as I-155 and terminates in Dyersburg, Tennessee.
The first section of I-24 to be completed was the section in Chattanooga between SR 58 (Market Street) and east of the railyard overpass, which was let to contract on September 18, 1957, and dedicated and opened on December 23, 1958. This was the first section of freeway in Chattanooga and the first section of Interstate in East Tennessee constructed under the Interstate Highway System. The interchange with I-75, along with the segment of I-75 extending to the Georgia state line, were let to contract on July 26, 1959, and dedicated on May 31, 1961. The first major section to be completed was the western ascent of Monteagle Mountain, which stretched from US 64 near Pelham to US 41 in Monteagle and eliminated a stretch of US 41 with several hazardous hairpin curves. Work began in September 1958, and the stretch opened to traffic on February 6, 1962. The short segment in Chattanooga between Belvoir Avenue and I-75 opened in late October 1962. This was followed by the short stretch between east of the railyard and Fourth Avenue on January 3, 1963. 

In Nashville, a short segment of the concurrent segment with I-40, located between Fesslers Lane and the eastern interchange with that route, was declared complete on January 11, 1965. The section between the western interchange with I-40 (then also I-65) and Fesslers Lane was partially opened in late December 1963 and fully opened on April 19, 1965. The Silliman Evans Bridge, along with the stretch extending from US 41 (First Street) and I-40 was dedicated on January 14, 1964. On July 27, 1965, the short section between US 431 (Trinity Lane) and US 41 (First Street) was opened. This section included provisions for the southern interchange with I-65 (then I-265), which had not been built yet. The Ridge Cut section in Chattanooga, which spanned between Fourth Avenue and Germantown Road, was dedicated on December 1, 1965. To construct the segment at the foot of Lookout Mountain west of downtown Chattanooga, engineers shifted the river channel to the north in order to avoid impeding the flow. This was accomplished by dredging out the north bank and filling in along the south bank with approximately of rock from a nearby quarry. This stretch of I-24, which spanned from US 41 in Lookout Valley to 23rd Street near downtown Chattanooga, was completed on December 16, 1966, at a cost of approximately $15 million (equivalent to $ in ), making it one of the most expensive highway projects, per mile, at the time. 

I-24 was complete in Marion County to Monteagle Mountain in late 1966 and between US 41 in Manchester and US 64 near Pelham on July 27, 1967. The short segment between SR 27 and SR 156 in Marion County, including the bridge over Nickajack Lake, opened on December 18, 1967. The stretch between US 41 in Lookout Valley and the interchange with I-59 in Dade County, Georgia, was jointly opened to traffic by both states on September 10, 1968, along with the of I-59. This was followed by the adjacent section extending west to SR 156 in early November 1968. In Nashville, the short section between US 431 and the northern interchange with I-65, along with a short stretch of I-65 north of this section, opened to traffic on December 23, 1968. The section between US 41 in northwestern Coffee County and US 41 in Manchester opened on December 3, 1969. On December 9, 1970, I-24 opened between US 231 in Murfreesboro and SR 64 near Beechgrove. The route was opened between SR 171 in Nashville and US 231 in Murfreesboro on December 31, 1970. The last segment of I-24 between Nashville and Chattanooga, the segment located between SR 64 near Beechgrove and US 41 northwest of Manchester, was let to contract on January 31, 1969, and opened and dedicated on December 16, 1971.

Construction began on I-24 between the Kentucky line and SR 48 in Clarksville on April 12, 1971. In February 1972, the FHWA announced that it was redistributing funds that had been budgeted for Interstate construction in Tennessee to other states which were further behind on their Interstates. I-24 between Nashville and Kentucky was one of the sections affected by this cutback, which threatened to delay completion. In response, the state legislature authorized the issuance of $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds to finance the completion of I-24. This allowed for TDOT to let contracts for the remaining sections between Nashville and Clarksville from September to November 1972. Once construction on the remainder of I-24 between Clarksville and Nashville was underway, the route was projected to be completed in late 1974 or early 1975, but would experience further delays as a result of geological problems. Construction on this approximately segment, the last segment of mainline Interstate Highway completed in Tennessee, proved to be difficult due to the rugged and hilly terrain. The approximately segment between US 68 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and US 79 in Clarksville, Tennessee, was jointly opened to traffic by both states on September 12, 1975. The section between US 79 and SR 49 in Robertson County was completed in September 1976. The last segment of I-24 in Tennessee, between SR 49 and I-65 in Nashville, was opened to traffic on January 5, 1978, more than two years behind schedule.

The Silliman Evans Bridge was widened from six to eight lanes in a project that completely closed the northbound span between January 20, 1974, and April 6, 1975, and the southbound span from April 6, 1975, to November 16, 1975. This project also added shoulders to the bridge and removed railings that had been deemed unsafe and were believed to have played a role in multiple fatal accidents on the bridge. 
A groundbreaking ceremony for the first stretch of I-24 in Kentucky was held on December 6, 1967, in Lyon County. The section of I-24 in Illinois was authorized for engineering by 1966 and authorized for construction by 1968. The first section of I-24 in Illinois, located between US 45 in Vienna and US 45 in Metropolis, was dedicated and opened by Governor Dan Walker on January 15, 1974. On October 18, 1974, the stretch between US 45 in Metropolis and US 60 in Paducah, including the Ohio River bridge, opened to traffic. This was also the first stretch of I-24 to open in Kentucky. The final segment of I-24 in Illinois, located between I-57 and US 45 in Vienna, was dedicated and opened to traffic by Governor Walker on January 24, 1976. In October 1977, the stretch between US 68 in Reidland and US 62 east of Calvert City was completed. 

The section between US 62 near Calvert City and KY 453, including the Tennessee River Bridge, which had been completed approximately five years prior, was opened to traffic on October 25, 1979. The section between US 60 in Paducah and US 68 in Reidland was opened and dedicated by Governor Julian Carroll on December 15, 1978. On December 10, 1979, the stretch between KY 453 and US 60/US 641 in Eddyville, including the Cumberland River Bridge, was opened. Construction on the bridge began in 1972, but issues caused by unusual rock formations at the site, believed to have been formed by the 1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes or earlier quakes, delayed completion and resulted in the cost nearly tripling. On March 20, 1980, the stretch in Eddyville between US 62/US 641 and the Western Kentucky Parkway (now I-69), along with the westernmost of the latter route, was opened. I-24 was completed when the section opened to traffic from what is now I-69 to US 68 east of Cadiz on May 23, 1980.

In November 1977, the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) installed a system to detect tailgating vehicles in the westbound lanes of the concurrent segment with I-40, which consisted of sensors embedded in the roadway connected to overhead warning signs with flashing lights and horns. The system was the first of its kind in the country but experienced technical problems and was criticized as ineffective, leading to its decommission in July 1980. This segment was widened from six to eight lanes between July 1979 and January 1980 by removing the right shoulders, narrowing the lanes by , and shifting traffic slightly to the left.

A project began in April 1985 that extensively straightened and rebuilt the eastbound lanes of I-24 on the eastern downgrade of Monteagle Mountain and reduced the grade. The project also added left shoulders and an additional runaway truck ramp, the latter of which was not originally planned. This work was completed in 1989, and the lanes were reopened on July 11 of that year in a ceremony officiated by Governor Ned McWherter. The project experienced many setbacks including geological problems, which caused extensive delays. Originally targeted for completion in December 1987 at a cost of $17 million (equivalent to $ in ), the final cost was $29.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). During this project, both directions of traffic were routed to the westbound lanes of I-24, which were separated by a Jersey barrier, and a temporary runaway truck ramp for eastbound traffic was also provided along this alignment. A truck station to allow for the adjustment of brakes opened in January 1992. After the safety improvements were completed, accidents in the eastbound lanes of this stretch dropped from 54 in 1983 to 3 in 1991.
The stretch between near SR 255 (Harding Place) and near SR 254 (Bell Road) was widened to six lanes between April 1989 and November 1990. Between November 1994 and November 1995, TDOT made safety modifications to I-24 through the eastern terminus with I-440 and the nearby split with I-40, which reconfigured the routes to provide direct access to I-440 westbound from I-40 westbound, splitting I-24&#x27;s eastbound lanes into two barrier-separated carriageways.

The approximately segment between Haywood Lane in Nashville and SR 266 in Smyrna was widened from four to eight lanes between June 1997 and December 1998, installing the first HOV lanes on I-24. The portion between SR 266 and I-840 was widened from four to eight lanes between August 1998 and November 2000. The segment between I-440 and Haywood Lane was widened from three to four lanes in each direction between March 2000 and May 2002 in a project that also improved the interchanges on this segment. Widening of the segment between I-840 and SR 96 began in early 2004 and was completed in the summer of 2005. This project added a new interchange at Medical Center Parkway. A project that widened I-24 from four to eight lanes between SR 96 and US 231, and also added a new interchange with SR 99, began in April 2006 and was completed on January 28, 2008.

In Chattanooga, the stretch between the bottom of the Ridge Cut and east of the Big Scramble was widened from four to six lanes in the mid- to latter 1980s. Between May 1989 and November 1991, the Big Scramble was modified in a project that eliminated left-hand entrance and exit ramps, widened parts of the main carriageway, and converted the westbound lanes of I-24 into the ramp carrying I-24 westbound traffic to US 27 northbound.

The original interchange with I-75, which was a simple directional T design, had repeatedly been ranked as one of the top 10 worst freight bottlenecks in the US by the American Transportation Research Institute and contained several sharp curves and other safety hazards. In December 2018, a contract was awarded to rebuild the interchange, with preliminary work beginning in May 2019. The project consisted of eliminating left-hand entrance and exit ramps from I-75 onto I-24, straightening curves, widening I-75 to six lanes through the interchange, widening two ramps from I-75 to I-24 to three lanes, replacing two overpass bridges, and construction of a collector–distributor facility that carries traffic directly from US 41 and the Tennessee Welcome Center along I-75 northbound, providing direct access to both I-75 northbound and I-24 westbound. Additional space was also provided to widen the remaining ramps between I-75 and I-24 to three lanes, which will be done in the second phase. The project was completed on August 19, 2021, at a cost of $133.5 million, making it the second-most expensive individual contract in state history at the time. The second phase will widen the adjacent segment of I-24 west of the interchange and lengthen auxiliary lanes on I-75 about north of the interchange. In preparation for the second phase, the Belvoir Avenue overpass and Germantown Road underpass were replaced between May 2020 and August 2021; the latter replacement utilized accelerated bridge construction by shifting I-24 traffic onto the Germantown Road entrance and exit ramp and adjacent frontage roads.

=== I-24 SMART Corridor ===
The stretch of I-24 between I-440 (exit 53) in Nashville and US 231 (exit 81) in Murfreesboro is currently in the process of being developed into the &quot;I-24 SMART Corridor&quot; in an effort to address congestion and mobility issues. In recent years, this stretch of I-24 has become the most congested highway corridor in the state, due to the rapid growth of the region. The project pairs this stretch with the adjacent paralleling stretch of US 41/US 70S (Murfreesboro Road) and all connecting roads in between. The first phase, which ran from October 2018 to December 2021, included the construction of emergency pull-offs, improvements to multiple entrance and exit ramps, the erection of additional roadside dynamic-message signs (DMSs), and upgrades to traffic signals along the corridor. The second phase, which began in March 2022, includes the erection of 67 overhead gantries with signs between mileposts 53 and 70 that will display recommended variable speed limits and variable lane control signs for each lane. The final phase will include the installation of ramp meters on certain onramps and the installation of additional closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and DMS boards and Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) improvements along connecting arterials.

===Major incidents===
On July 27, 1973, a station wagon traveling on the northbound span of the Silliman Evans Bridge in Nashville crashed through the bridge&#x27;s guardrails, exited the roadway, and landed on the ground about below, killing eight of the nine occupants and injuring the other. The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which named a number of unsafe design features of the bridge as contributors to the crash. The report also concluded that the state had been aware of the safety hazards of the bridge&#x27;s rails prior to the accident, which had played a role in previous fatal accidents on the bridge. This accident was cited as the primary event that led to the widening project on the bridge months later.

In 1979, structural problems were discovered on the Ohio River Bridge, including 119 cracks as a result of defective welding in the tie girders. The bridge was closed on August 3, 1979, and remained closed to all traffic through October 1980 and all truck traffic until mid-1981.

On May 18, 2010, it was announced that a sinkhole was found in the eastbound lanes of I-24 in Grundy County near the exit to US 64/SR 50 (exit 127). TDOT officials stated that the hole was growing and diverted traffic onto the westbound lanes. Following emergency repairs, the highway was reopened several days later.

==Future==
TDOT and GDOT are jointly making preparations to widen the stretch of I-24 from I-59 to US 27 in Chattanooga to six lanes. This project is expected to be split into three phases, due to its location within two states and the difficulties of expanding the stretch which is located on a narrow artificial causeway between Lookout Mountain and the Tennessee River. This stretch has long experienced severe congestion issues and is considered a major bottleneck, particularly for trucks.

Other stretches of I-24 planned to be widened in the near future include the stretch through Clarksville, the stretch between SR 45 and I-65 northwest of Nashville, and the eastern leg of the downtown loop in Nashville between I-65 and I-40.

===Interstate 124===
Interstate 124 (I-124) is an unsigned designation for a short segment of a four-lane controlled-access highway located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During periods where this segment of US 27 has been signed as I-124, it has served as a spur route of I-24 to downtown Chattanooga. The road segment has not been signed as I-124 since the late 1980s (it is marked on overhead signs and milemarkers as US 27), and the TDOT official map no longer designates it as I-124, but some TDOT publications still make reference to the designation.

===Paducah business loop===

Interstate 24 Business (I-24 Bus.) is an business loop of I-24 that travels through downtown Paducah, Kentucky, that begins at I-24 and US 60 at exit 4 and ends at I-24 and KY 1954 at exit 11. Originally designated as Interstate 24 Downtown (I-24 Dwtn.), the route was repurposed as I-24 Bus. in 2002. The highway follows US 60, US 60 Bus., and KY 1954.

<doc id="88887" wikidata="Q318292" url="?curid=88887" title="Roger Corman">
<text>Roger William Corman (April 5, 1926 – May 9, 2024) was an American film director, producer, and actor. Known under various monikers such as &quot;The Pope of Pop Cinema&quot;, &quot;The Spiritual Godfather of the New Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;The King of Cult&quot;, he was known as a trailblazer in the world of independent film.

Many of the more than 500 features directed or produced by Corman were low-budget films that later attracted a cult following, such as &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (1959), &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1960), &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1962), &quot;&quot; (1963), and the counterculture films &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967). &quot;House of Usher&quot; (1960) became the first of eight films directed by Corman that were adapted from the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, and which collectively came to be known as the &quot;Poe Cycle&quot;.

In 1964, Corman became the youngest filmmaker to have a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, as well as in the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art. He was the co-founder of New World Pictures, the founder of New Concorde and was a longtime member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2009, he was awarded an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for his rich engendering of films and filmmakers&quot;.

Corman was also famous for handling the U.S. distribution of many films by noted foreign directors, including Federico Fellini (Italy), Ingmar Bergman (Sweden), François Truffaut (France) and Akira Kurosawa (Japan). He mentored and gave a start to many young film directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Peter Bogdanovich, Joe Dante, John Sayles, and James Cameron, and was highly influential in the New Hollywood filmmaking movement of the 1960s and 1970s. He also helped to launch the careers of actors including Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd, and William Shatner.

Corman occasionally acted in films by directors who started with him, including &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004). A documentary about Corman&#x27;s life and career titled &quot;Corman&#x27;s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel&quot;, directed by Alex Stapleton, premiered at the Sundance and Cannes Film Festivals in 2011. The film&#x27;s TV rights were picked up by A&amp;E IndieFilms after a well-received screening at Sundance.

== Early life and education ==
Corman was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Anne (née High) and William Corman, an engineer of Russian Jewish descent. His younger brother, Gene, produced numerous films, sometimes in collaboration with Roger. Corman was raised in his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith.

Corman went to Beverly Hills High School and then to Stanford University to study industrial engineering. While at Stanford, Corman realized he did not want to be an engineer. He enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program when he still had six months of study to complete. After serving in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946, he returned to Stanford to finish his degree, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering in 1947. While at Stanford University, Corman was initiated in the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

In 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on Slauson Avenue in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss &quot;I&#x27;ve made a terrible mistake.&quot; Soon after that he found work at 20th Century Fox as a messenger in the mail room, earning $32.50 per week.

== Career ==
=== 1950–1959: Early film career ===
Corman worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; with Gregory Peck. When Corman received no credit at all, he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the G.I. Bill, Corman studied English literature at the University of Oxford and lived in Paris for a time.

Corman then returned to Los Angeles and tried to re-establish himself in the film industry. He took various jobs, including television stagehand at KLAC-TV and a messenger at Fox. He worked as an assistant to literary agent Dick Hyland.

Corman wrote a script in his spare time and sold it to William F. Broidy at Allied Artists for US$2,000 (). &quot;Dick thought it was funny and let me pay myself a commission,&quot; said Corman. Originally called &quot;House in the Sea&quot;, it was retitled &quot;Highway Dragnet&quot; (1954) and starred Richard Conte and Joan Bennett. Corman also worked as associate producer on the film for nothing, just for the experience.

Corman used his script fee and personal contacts to raise US$12,000 () to produce his first feature, a science-fiction film, &quot;Monster from the Ocean Floor&quot; (1954). It was produced by Corman&#x27;s own company, Palo Alto, and released by Robert L. Lippert.

The film did well enough to encourage Corman to produce another film, the racing-car thriller &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (1955), directed by its star, John Ireland, and co-starring Dorothy Malone. (Decades later, the title would be licensed from Corman for a blockbuster film of the same name.) Corman sold the movie to a new independent company, the American Releasing Company (ARC), run by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Although Corman had a number of offers for the film from Republic and Columbia, he elected to go with ARC, because they undertook to advance money to enable him to make two more movies.

Corman&#x27;s second film for ARC was one he decided to direct, &quot;Five Guns West&quot; (1955), a Western, made in color for around $60,000, with Malone and John Lund. The script was written by Robert Wright Campbell, who worked with Corman on several more occasions. Corman announced he would make four more projects for ARC: &quot;High Steel&quot;, &quot;Cobra&quot;, &quot;Fortress Beneath the Sea&quot;, and an untitled film from Campbell. Instead, Corman did some uncredited directing on &quot;The Beast with a Million Eyes&quot; (1955), then made another Western, &quot;Apache Woman&quot; (1955), starring Lloyd Bridges, written by Lou Rusoff. Rusoff and Corman reunited on &quot;Day the World Ended&quot; (1955), a postapocalyptic science-fiction film, which was popular.

Corman was to make &quot;The Devil on Horseback&quot; by Charles B. Griffith about the Brownsville Raid, but it was too expensive. The Woolner Brothers, Louisiana drive-in owners, financed Corman&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Women&quot; (1956), a girls-on-the-lam saga. He returned to ARC for two Westerns, &quot;The Oklahoma Woman&quot; (1956) and &quot;Gunslinger&quot; (1956) (with Ireland); &quot;Gunslinger&quot; was co-written by Griffith, who became a crucial collaborator with Corman over the next five years. He bought a script from Curtis Harrington, &quot;The Girl from Beneath the Sea&quot;. Harrington made it for Corman years later as &quot;Night Tide&quot; (1961).

Beverly Garland, one of Corman&#x27;s early regular stock players, recalled working with him:

Roger made us work hard and long, I remember that! He was always fascinating to me, a fascinating man – and a good businessman! He had such incredible energy, it was tremendous – he was a dynamo to be around. I always knew he was going to be a huge success because there was no stopping him. He just made up his mind that he was going to be a success and that was it.
ARC changed its name to American International Pictures. Corman was established as their leading filmmaker. They financed Corman&#x27;s next film as director, the science-fiction story &quot;It Conquered the World&quot; (1956). Co-written by Griffith, it was a follow-up to &quot;The Day the World Ended&quot;. It was a big hit.

He optioned a TV play, &quot;The Stake&quot;, and hoped to get Dana Andrews to star. It was never made. Instead, Walter Mirisch of Allied Artists hired Corman to make &quot;The Undead&quot; (1957), inspired by &quot;The Search for Bridey Murphy&quot;. Griffith wrote the script. In June, Corman made a science-fiction film for Allied Artists, &quot;Not of this Earth&quot; (1957), written by Griffith. In August 1956, AIP financed a Corman heist movie shot in Hawaii, &quot;Naked Paradise&quot; (1957), co-written by Griffith. Corman shot it back-to-back with a movie made with his own money, &quot;She Gods of Shark Reef&quot; (1958). Corman wound up selling the movie to AIP. Corman and Griffith reunited in &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters&quot; (1957) for Allied, which wound up being one of his most successful early films.

For his own production company, Corman made a rock-and-roll &quot;quickle&quot;, &quot;Carnival Rock&quot; (1957), released by Howco. &quot;Rock All Night&quot; (1957) was a heist film written by Griffith expanded from a TV play, &quot;The Little Guy&quot;, with musical acts inserted. He was meant to make &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Girl&quot; for AIP in December 1957. In April 1957, Corman announced he would try to make two films back-to-back from then on to save costs.

Corman made two &quot;teen girl noirs&quot;, &quot;Teenage Doll&quot; (1957) for the Woolner Brothers and &quot;Sorority Girl&quot; (1957), starring Susan Cabot for AIP. For AIP, he made &quot;The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent&quot; (1957), shot in August 1957. He was meant to follow this with &quot;Teenage Jungle&quot; by Tony Miller. The success of &quot;Not of this Earth&quot; and &quot;Crab Monsters&quot; led to Allied offering Corman a four-picture deal for 1958.

Corman received his first serious critical praise for &quot;Machine-Gun Kelly&quot; (1958), an AIP biopic of the famous gangster, which gave Charles Bronson his first leading role and co-starred Cabot. Campbell wrote the script. Also for AIP, he did &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot; (1958), with Robert Vaughn, originally titled &quot;Prehistoric World&quot;. He helped produce two films for Allied Artists, both from scripts by Leo Gordon: &quot;Hot Car Girl&quot; (1958), directed by Bernard Kowalski and produced by his brother Gene (the first film they made together) from a script by Gordon; and &quot;The Cry Baby Killer&quot; (1958), which gave Jack Nicholson his first starring role.

He had his biggest budget yet for &quot;I Mobster&quot; (1958), a gangster story, co-produced by Edward L. Alperson and Corman&#x27;s brother Gene for 20th Century Fox. In September 1958, he was reported as scouting locations in Australia to do a remake of H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. &quot;War of the Satellites&quot; (1958) was conceived and shot in record time to take advantage of the Sputnik launch; it was his first collaboration with art director Daniel Haller. Corman also produced, but did not direct, &quot;Stakeout on Dope Street&quot; (1958), directed by Irvin Kershner, &quot;Night of the Blood Beast&quot; (1958), directed by Kowalski for AIP, using leftover costumes from &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot;, and &quot;Crime and Punishment U.S.A.&quot; (1959), directed by Dennis Sanders with George Hamilton in his first lead role.

=== The Filmgroup ===

In January 1959, Corman announced he would be moving into distribution.

In 1959, Corman founded The Filmgroup with his brother Gene, a company producing or releasing low-budget black-and-white films as double features for drive-ins and action houses. In February 1959, Filmgroup announced they would release 10 films. Their first movies were &quot;High School Big Shot&quot; (1959) and &quot;T-Bird Gang&quot; (1959), produced by Stanley Bickman.

For AIP, Corman and Griffith made a black comedy, &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (1959). Corman announced he would follow it with a similar comedy, &quot;The Bloodshot Private Eye&quot;. It does not seem to have been made. Instead, Griffith reused the same script structure and Corman employed many of the same cast in &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1960). This film was reputedly shot in two days and one night.

For Filmgroup, Corman directed &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot; (1959), starring Cabot from a script by Gordon. His brother and he made two films back-to-back in South Dakota: &quot;Ski Troop Attack&quot; (1960), a war movie written by Griffith and directed by Corman, and &quot;Beast from Haunted Cave&quot; (1959), the first film directed by Monte Hellman.

Corman went to Puerto Rico and produced another two films back-to-back: &quot;Battle of Blood Island&quot; (1960), directed by Joel Rapp, and &quot;Last Woman on Earth&quot; (1960), directed by Corman from a script by Robert Towne. Filming on these two films went so quickly and incentivized by the tax breaks on offer for filming in Puerto Rico, Corman commissioned Griffith to write a third, which was shot at the same time: &quot;Creature from the Haunted Sea&quot; (1961).

Corman was going to make &quot;Part Time Mother&quot; from a script by Griffith but it appears to have never been made.

=== 1960–1969: Adaptations and studio work ===

AIP wanted Corman to make two horror films for them, in black and white, at under $100,000 each on a 10-day shooting schedule. Corman, however, was tired of making films on this sort of budget and was worried the market for them was in decline. He proposed making a film in color for $200,000, shot over 15 days. Corman proposed an adaptation of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe and AIP agreed. The film was announced in May 1959.

Richard Matheson was hired to do the adaptation and Vincent Price was brought in to star; Haller did the art direction. The resulting film, &quot;House of Usher&quot; (1960), shot in early 1960, was a critical and commercial hit.

Following this, Corman bought two scripts, &quot;Sob Sisters Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. In March 1960, Corman announced that Filmgroup would be part of an international production group, Compass Productions. He directed a peplum in Greece, &quot;Atlas&quot;, (1961) in August.

He was going to direct a thriller from a script by Robert Towne, &quot;I Flew a Spy Plane Over Russia&quot;. It was not made; neither were two comedies he was to make with Dick Miller and Jon Haze, &quot;Murder at the Convention&quot; and &quot;Pan and the Satyrs&quot;.

&quot;House of Usher&quot; had been so successful that AIP wanted a follow-up, and Corman, Haller, Matheson and Price reunited on &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961). It was another sizable hit, and the &quot;Poe cycle&quot; of films was underway.

Corman hired Charles Beaumont to write &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot; and announced two films, &quot;Captain Nemo and the Floating City&quot; and &quot;House of Secrets&quot;.

=== &quot;The Intruder&quot; ===
Following &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, Corman directed one of William Shatner&#x27;s earliest appearances in a lead role with &quot;The Intruder&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Stranger&quot;, 1962). Based on a novel by Charles Beaumont, the film was co-produced by Gene Corman and was shot in July and August 1961. It took a while for the film to be released and it lost money.

Corman was unhappy with his profit participation on the first two Poe films, so he made a third adaptation for different producers, &quot;The Premature Burial&quot; (1962), written by Charles Beaumont and starring Ray Milland. The film was co-financed by Pathe labs; AIP put pressure on Pathe by threatening to withdraw lab work from them and ended up buying out their interest.

For producer Edward Small, Corman made a historical horror piece about Richard III, &quot;Tower of London&quot; (1962), starring Vincent Price. It was meant to be the first in a three-picture deal with Small, but Corman did not enjoy working with the producer.

For Filmgroup, he also bought the rights to a Soviet science-fiction film, &quot;Nebo Zovyot&quot; (1959) and had some additional footage shot for it by his then-assistant, Francis Ford Coppola; the result was &quot;Battle Beyond the Sun&quot; (1962). He also released &quot;The Magic Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1962), dubbed from a Soviet film.

The fourth Poe was an anthology, &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; (1962), shot in late 1961. One of the installments, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, was a comedy, inspiring Corman to do a whole Poe story comedically next: &quot;The Raven&quot; (1963). Later, Corman used the sets for that film for &quot;The Terror&quot; (1963), made for Filmgroup but released by AIP, and starring Boris Karloff (whose scenes were all shot in two days) and Jack Nicholson. Corman did not direct all of this film; additional scenes were shot by Monte Hellman, Coppola, and Jack Hill, among others.

&quot;The Young Racers&quot; (1963) was produced and directed by Corman in Europe for AIP, starring and written by Campbell. Working on the film was Francis Ford Coppola, whom Corman financed to make his directorial debut, &quot;Dementia 13&quot; (1963).

Back in the U.S., Corman made &quot;&quot; (1963), a contemporary science-fiction film for AIP starring Ray Milland. He followed it with &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; (1963), ostensibly part of the Poe cycle—it featured Price and was made for AIP, written by Beaumont—but was actually based on a story by H. P. Lovecraft.

Corman directed a war film in Yugoslavia with his brother, &quot;The Secret Invasion&quot; (1964), with Stewart Granger and Mickey Rooney, from a script by Campbell. Following this, he announced he would make &quot;The Life of Robert E. Lee&quot; as part of a four-picture deal with Filmgroup worth $3.75 million. Other movies were &quot;Fun and Profit&quot; by Joel Rapp, &quot;The Wild Surfers&quot; by John Lamb, and &quot;Planet of Storms&quot; by Jack Hill. None of these films was made, nor was &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;, a Poe adaptation written by Griffith.

=== End of the Poe cycle and filming in Europe ===
Corman made two Poes in England starring Price, the much-delayed &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1964), with Campbell rewriting Beaumont&#x27;s scripts, and &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; (1965), from a script by Robert Towne. Corman made no further Poes; AIP started up a fresh Poe cycle in the late 1960s, but Corman was not part of it.

Corman got Towne to write a script called &quot;The Red Baron&quot;. He bought the rights to another Soviet science-fiction film, &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; (1962), and had some additional footage added to it by Curtis Harrington. The result was &quot;Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet&quot; (1965). Harrington used footage from &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; in another film financed by Corman, &quot;Queen of Blood&quot; (1966).

He also bought the rights to a Yugoslavian film, &quot;Operation Titan&quot; (1963), and financed additional shooting by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman. The result was &quot;Blood Bath&quot; (1966). He also had an investment in the beach party films &quot;Beach Ball&quot; (1965) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Bikini World&quot; (1967).

=== Working for major studios ===
Corman said, &quot;For ten years as an independent I could get financing for $100–$200–$300,000 pictures. Everything had been interesting, artistically satisfying, economically satisfying. But I decided I was going nowhere and wanted to move directly into the business. So I accepted a contract with Columbia.&quot;

In August 1965, Corman announced he had signed a contract with United Artists to make two films over three years. He also signed with Columbia to make a Western, &quot;The Long Ride Home&quot;, based on a script by Robert Towne.

He was announced for a number of other projects at Columbia: the biopic of Robert E. Lee, an adaptation of &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, an adaptation of Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Penal Colony&quot;, and a script by novelist Richard Yates about the Battle of Iwo Jima. He intended to make &quot;The Deserters&quot; for UA, from a script by Wright, but that was not made either.

He later reflected, &quot;Every idea I submitted was considered too strange, too weird; every idea they had seemed too ordinary to me. Ordinary pictures don&#x27;t make money.&quot;

=== &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; ===
After a year of not directing, Corman took a leave of absence under his contract with Columbia to make a film for AIP, the first biker movie, &quot;The Wild Angels&quot;. It starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra, from a script by Griffith; Peter Bogdanovich worked as Corman&#x27;s assistant. The film opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival and was hugely successful at the box office, making over $6 million on a $350,000 budget and kicking off the &quot;biker movie&quot; cycle.

He wanted to make a film about the Red Baron, but Columbia turned it down because of &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966). He proposed a movie about the St Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre and also an adaptation of the novel &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;. Nick Ray was meant to be making &quot;Only Lovers&quot; in Britain.

Corman did begin directing &quot;Long Ride Home&quot; with Glenn Ford at Columbia. However, Corman left production a few weeks into the shoot in June 1966 and was replaced by Phil Karlson. The film was retitled &quot;A Time for Killing&quot; (1967).

Corman received an offer to direct a studio film, &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; (1967), for 20th Century Fox, starring Jason Robards and George Segal. He did not enjoy the restrictions of working for a major studio. He was given a $2.5 million budget and made it for $400,000 less. Corman, an independent director, was most comfortable in his own style: shoestring budgets and shooting schedules measured in days, rather than weeks. Nonetheless, it is generally considered one of his best films as a director.

Corman was meant to follow this with &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; for United Artists at a budget of $4.5 million. It was not made. Neither was a story Corman optioned, &quot;The Spy in the Vatican&quot;.

=== 1965–1971: Return to independent films ===

Corman continued to finance films for Filmgroup: &quot;Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet&quot; (1965), dubbing a Soviet movie &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; into English with some additional footage shot by Curtis Harrington, &quot;Queen of Blood&quot; (1966), using some Soviet footage but a mostly new film, directed by Harrington, &quot;Blood Bath&quot; (1966), an adapted Yugoslavian film with additional footage shot by Stephanie Rothman and Jack Hill, and &quot;Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women&quot; (1967), yet another dubbed version of &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; with some additional footage shot by Corman&#x27;s then-assistant Peter Bogdanovich.

Corman had money in &quot;Navy vs. the Night Monsters&quot; (1967). He financed two Westerns shot back to back in Utah, directed by Monte Hellman and written and co-produced by Jack Nicholson, &quot;The Shooting&quot; (1967) and &quot;Ride in the Whirlwind&quot; (1967), which were never released theatrically in the US but became cult successes several years later. He also financed two films directed by Dan Haller, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1967), a follow-up to &quot;Wild Angels&quot; written by Griffith, and a car racing film shot in Europe, &quot;The Wild Racers&quot; (1968). He announced a comedy about the population explosion, &quot;There Just Isn&#x27;t Any Room&quot;, but it appears to have never been made.

Corman directed &quot;The Trip&quot; for AIP, written by Jack Nicholson and starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Bruce Dern. This began the psychedelic film craze of the late 1960s and was the American entry at Cannes that year. Corman took LSD and used the experience to shape the film. AIP made some changes to the film in post-production, which made Corman unhappy.

In September 1967, Corman announced plans to build a new film studio. However, this did not happen for a number of years.

Corman made a film for American TV, &quot;&quot; (1968), shot in Europe with his brother producing. He did some uncredited directing on AIP&#x27;s &quot;De Sade&quot; (1969) when director Cy Endfield fell ill. He financed Bogdanovich&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Targets&quot; (1968), which incorporated footage from &quot;The Terror&quot;. He also produced &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1970) for AIP, directed by Haller and co-written by Curtis Hanson, and financed Haller&#x27;s &quot;Paddy&quot;.

For AIP, Corman returned to the director&#x27;s chair for a gangster film, &quot;Bloody Mama&quot; (1970), starring Shelley Winters and a young Robert de Niro. It was a big hit at the box office. He also directed a black comedy, &quot;Gas-s-s-s&quot; (1970), written by George Armitage; it was cut without his permission by AIP and was a financial failure.
United Artists finally agreed to finance his Red Baron project, although they asked that it emphasize American characters. Accordingly, it was filmed as &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot; (1971), shot in Ireland in July 1970. There were several plane crashes during filming and one person died. Corman was going to make a film of &quot;Couples&quot;, a novel by John Updike for United Artists, and &quot;In&quot; from a script by Richard Schupe, but decided to take a break from directing. &quot;Directing is very hard and very painful,&quot; he said in 1971. &quot;Producing is easy. I can do it without really thinking about it.&quot;

== New World Pictures ==
In May 1970, Corman founded New World Pictures, which became a small independently owned production/distribution studio, immediately successful with &quot;Angels Die Hard&quot; (1970), a biker film, and &quot;The Student Nurses&quot; (1971), directed by Rothman. &quot;The Big Doll House&quot; (1971), directed by Jack Hill in the Philippines, was a big hit, making a star of Pam Grier. The company made a profit of $3.2 million in its first financial year, and Corman said all eleven out of his first eleven films were successful. &quot;Angels Die Hard&quot; led to a series of biker films, including &quot;Angels Hard as They Come&quot; (1971), produced by Jonathan Demme with Jack Fisk working as art director. &quot;Bury Me an Angel&quot; (1971) was the first biker movie directed by a woman, Barbara Peeters. Corman financed the directorial debuts of Curtis Hanson, &quot;Sweet Kill&quot; (1973), produced by Corman protégée Tamara Asseyev. &quot;Student Nurses&quot; led to a &quot;cycle&quot; of nurse pictures, including &quot;Private Duty Nurses&quot; (the first film directed by George Armitage), &quot;Night Call Nurses&quot; (1972) (the first feature directed by Jonathan Kaplan), &quot;The Young Nurses&quot; and &quot;Candy Stripe Nurses&quot; (1975). There was also &quot;The Student Teachers&quot; (1973) and &quot;Summer School Teachers&quot; (1974). &quot;Big Doll House&quot; was followed by a series of women in prison pictures, such as &quot;Women in Cages&quot; (1972), &quot;The Hot Box&quot; (1972), &quot;Black Mama, White Mama&quot; (1973), &quot;The Arena&quot; (1974) (the first film directed by Steve Carver) and &quot;Caged Heat&quot; (1974) (the first film directed by Demme). Of New World&#x27;s second year, Corman said 11 of the 12 releases were successful. Corman produced one more film at AIP, &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; (1972), the second feature directed by Martin Scorsese, starring David Carradine. He also executive produced &quot;Unholy Rollers&quot; (1972) for AIP. A proposed political satire, &quot;The Wild Political Prank&quot;, was not made. He made &quot;I Escaped from Devil&#x27;s Island&quot; (1973) with his brother and produced &quot;Cockfighter&quot; (1974) with Monte Hellman, which was a rare financial failure for New World. A big hit was &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot; (1974), a gangster film directed by Carver and starring Angie Dickinson. It led to a follow-up, &quot;Crazy Mama&quot; (1975), produced by his wife and directed by Demme. In 1975, Corman said New World was &quot;the most successful independent film company in the country...if you count AIP as a major&quot;. He said they were &quot;the best of the cheap acts&quot;.

=== Distributing foreign films ===
In the 1970s, the major Hollywood studios were moving away from distributing foreign arthouse pictures, New World moved into the market and became the U.S. distributor for &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972), directed by Ingmar Bergman. Corman bought it for $75,000 and it earned over $2 million at the U.S. box office. and Corman&#x27;s distribution side of New World brought many foreign films to mass audiences in the U.S. for the first time – reportedly some played at drive-ins and grindhouses – including the works of François Truffaut (&quot;The Story of Adele H.&quot;, &quot;Small Change&quot;), Peter Weir (&quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot;), Federico Fellini (&quot;Amarcord&quot;), Joseph Losey (&quot;The Romantic Englishwoman&quot;), Volker Schlöndorff (&quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot;, &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;) and Akira Kurosawa (&quot;Dersu Uzala&quot;). New World also released &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; (1974).

In a 10-year period, New World Pictures won more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film than all other studios combined.

=== 20th Century Fox ===
Corman had a four-picture deal with 20th Century Fox, making &quot;Capone&quot; (1975), &quot;Fighting Mad&quot; (1976) (directed by Demme), &quot;Moving Violation&quot; (1976) and &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; (1977). According to &quot;Filmink&quot;, &quot;most of his Fox movies may as well have been made for Corman&#x27;s own company, as I&#x27;m sure he himself realised.&quot;

=== Peak of New World ===
&quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (1975), written by Robert Thom and directed by Paul Bartel, was a big hit, earning $4 million. It helped inspire a series of car chase movies: &quot;Cannonball&quot; (1976), directed by Bartel; &quot;Eat My Dust!&quot; (1976), directed by Griffith starring Ron Howard, which led to a follow-up, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1978), Howard&#x27;s directorial debut. Other films from the same period included &quot;The Great Texas Dynamite Chase&quot; (1976), &quot;Deathsport&quot; (1978), and &quot;Smokey Bites the Dust&quot; (1981).

New World&#x27;s trailers were cut by Joe Dante and Alan Arkush. Corman gave them the chance to direct together, with &quot;Hollywood Boulevard&quot; (1976), which used outtakes from other New World films. It was successful enough for Corman to give both men jobs directing features on their own: Dante with &quot;Piranha&quot; (1978) and Arkush with &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979).

&quot;Piranha&quot; was written by John Sayles, who had been discovered by Corman&#x27;s story editor, Frances Doel. Sayles later wrote &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; (1979) for Corman, which was directed by Lewis Teague and featured the first score by James Horner.

Other popular films around this time included &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; (1975), a Japanese film to which Corman added some extra footage, and &quot;Jackson County Jail&quot; (1976). He also financed &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot;. Less popular was &quot;Avalanche&quot; (1979), a disaster film directed by Corey Allen, which only grossed $87,000 on a budget of $6.5 million.

For Universal, he made &quot;Fast Charlie... the Moonbeam Rider&quot; (1979), directed by Carver. He produced Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1979).

Corman was criticized when he insisted on the addition of footage featuring a rape for &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot; (1980). Similarly, in &quot;Galaxy of Terror&quot;, as noted on &quot;Schlock and Awe...some&quot;, &quot;Corman promised the investors that the film would feature a Taaffe O&#x27;Connell sex-scene and a gruesome death-scene as-well. To save time, Corman put the two together. The actress agreed to a nude scene, but NOT a rape scene. Corman isn&#x27;t the kind of man who takes no for an answer, and after some contract renegotiation, O&#x27;Connell agreed to being raped to death by a giant worm-monster. &quot;Money&quot;... it does amazing things.&quot;

The success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; inspired New World&#x27;s most expensive film yet, &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1981). This film required extensive special effects, prompting Corman to buy a movie studio in Main Street Venice for $1.5 million. Corman made a TV film for CBS, &quot;The Georgia Peaches&quot; (1980).

&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; was so successful Corman had its footage and music score reused in other films such as &quot;Galaxy of Terror&quot; (1981) and &quot;Forbidden World&quot; (1982).

Corman picked up a film called &quot;The Personals&quot; (1983) that enjoyed success.

=== Millennium Films ===
Corman sold New World Pictures in January 1983 to a consortium of three lawyers for $16.9 million.

Under the terms of the contract, he agreed to stay on as a consultant for two years and to provide New World with at least five films they could release. New World agreed to distribute all of Corman&#x27;s films until March 1984. He set up a new production company, Millennium – the title of which was taken from the name of a 1981 retrospective of Corman&#x27;s work at the National Film Theatre in London. He announced plans to make films budgeted between $2–5 million using cash from his sale of New World to finance personally. He announced an intention to make fewer commercial films, movies more like &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot; and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;.

Millennium&#x27;s films included &quot;Space Raiders&quot; (1983), a science fiction epic using footage and music from &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot;; &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1984), a serious drama from Amy Holden Jones; &quot;Screwballs&quot; (1984), a sex comedy in the vein of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;; &quot;Suburbia&quot; (1984), directed by Penelope Spheeris, which he acquired, &quot;Deathstalker&quot;; and &quot;Kain of Dark Planet&quot; (which became &quot;The Warrior and the Sorceress&quot;). &quot;Deathstalker&quot; was made through Corman&#x27;s old company, Palo Alto Productions; it was the first in a series of sword and scorcery films he did in Argentina. (Corman would ultimately made nine co productions in Argentina with the local company Aries.

== New Horizons ==
Corman says people struggled with the name &quot;Millennium&quot; – &quot;nobody could spell it, nobody knew what it meant&quot; – so he changed it to New Horizons by early 1984.

Corman and the new owners of New World ended up suing each other in March 1985. Corman claimed that New World failed to honor their guarantee to distribute his movies at a fee of 15%. He sought $400 million in damages and the return of the company. He said they refused to distribute &quot;School Spirit&quot; (1985) and &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;. He also claimed that New World cheated him distributing &quot;Space Raiders&quot;, &quot;Screwballs&quot; and &quot;Slumber Party Massacre&quot;. New World sued Corman in return, claiming he was seeking to return to distribution, and was discrediting New World to potential investors. They said Corman bypassed New World for some of his films, such as Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Hardbodies&quot; (1984). Corman argued, &quot;My whole point in selling was to free myself of the burden of running the company and to get guaranteed distribution. If I can&#x27;t get my guaranteed distribution, I&#x27;m forced to go back to running the company.&quot;

=== Concorde Pictures ===
The case with New World settled out of court. In March 1985 Corman announced he would establish a new distribution &quot;cooperative&quot;, Concorde Pictures, where producers could get relatively cheap distribution from Concorde in exchange for contributing to the company&#x27;s overhead. Their first releases were Corman productions &quot;School Spirit&quot;, &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; and &quot;Barbarian Queen&quot;. Concorde later merged with a low-budget production company, Cinema Group, and announced plans to make 15–20 films a year. The first release between Cinema Release and Concorde was &quot;Streetwalkin&#x27;&quot;, a more serious drama from Joan Freeman.

Early Concorde releases also include &quot;Loose Screws&quot; (1985), a sequel to &quot;Screwballs&quot;; &quot;Cocaine Wars&quot; (1986), the first in a series of movies Corman would finance in South America; &quot;Hour of the Assassin&quot; (1987), shot in Peru and the first film directed by Luis Llosa; and &quot;Munchies&quot; (1987), a spoof of &quot;Gremlins&quot; directed by Tina Hirsch.

Corman also remade &quot;Not of this Earth&quot; (1988) and released &quot;Big Bad Mama II&quot; (1987), and &quot;Transylvania Twist&quot; (1989); all three were directed by Jim Wynorski. He produced another version of &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1989), directed by Larry Brand. He produced &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (1987), &quot;Slumber Party Massacre II&quot; (1988), directed by Deborah Brock, &quot;Andy Colby&#x27;s Incredible Adventure&quot; (1988), also directed by Brock, and &quot;The Terror Within&quot; (1989), directed by Thierry Notz. Corman financed the early directorial efforts of Carl Franklin (&quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; (1989)), Vargas Llosa and Katt Shea (&quot;Stripped to Kill&quot; (1988), &quot;Stripped to Kill II&quot; (1989)). More experimental was &quot;Nightfall&quot; (1988). After &quot;Hour of the Assassin&quot;, he made a series of films in Peru, including &quot;Crime Zone&quot; (1989), also directed by Luis Llosa, and &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot; (1990), directed by Carl Franklin. Concorde had a big hit with &quot;Bloodfist&quot; (1989), starring Don &quot;the Dragon&quot; Wilson which cost $1 million and earned over $6 million. Concorde signed Wilson to a long-term contract and he made a number of sequels for the company, including &quot;Bloodfist II&quot; and &quot;Fighting to Win&quot;.

=== Return to directing ===
Corman returned to directing once more with &quot;Frankenstein Unbound&quot; (1990). In 1990, Concorde sued MGM for $6 million. Concorde&#x27;s films included &quot;Overexposed&quot; (1990), &quot;The Unborn&quot; (1991), and &quot;In the Heat of Passion&quot; (1992). They had a big hit with &quot;Carnosaur&quot; (1993), which led to several sequels. He financed &quot;Fire on the Amazon&quot; (1991, directed Luis Llosa) which had Sandra Bullock and Craig Sheffer in early roles.

Corman had to deal with the decline of the drive-in market and studio competition through the 1990s, but Concorde-New Horizons still made 15–24 pictures a year. This included a never-released version of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, that Stan Lee claimed was made solely for the producer Bernd Eichinger and his production company Constantin Films to retain the film rights. Avi Arad, one of Marvel&#x27;s owners at the time, disputes this and contends that he bought out Corman &amp; Eichinger in order to protect the image of the characters for future films. This version was supported by both Corman &amp; Eichinger.

=== &quot;Roger Corman Presents&quot; ===
In 1995, Corman was executive producer on &quot;Roger Corman Presents&quot;, a special series of 13 movies for Showtime with budgets of around $1.5 million each. &quot;I think the Corman name means action, humor and some titillation,&quot; says Mike Elliott, the producer of the series. &quot;It&#x27;s going to deliver the goods – and it will have a little moral statement in there as well.&quot; Corman ended up doing a second season of 11 movies. The films were &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Burial of the Rats&quot;, &quot;Hellfire&quot;, &quot;Virtual Seduction&quot;, &quot;Suspect Device&quot;, &quot;Unknown Origin&quot;, &quot;Terminal Virus&quot;, &quot;Where Evil Lies&quot;, &quot;Vampirella&quot;, &quot;Shadow of a Scream&quot;, &quot;Subliminal Seduction&quot;, &quot;House of the Damned&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Spectre&quot;), &quot;The Haunted Sea&quot;, &quot;Alien Avengers&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Aliens Among Us&quot;) and its sequel, &quot;Inhumanoid&quot;, &quot;Sawbones&quot;, &quot;Not Like Us&quot;, and &quot;Last Exit to Earth&quot;. He created his own comic book franchise, &quot;Black Scorpion&quot;, which led to a sequel and later a TV series. Corman also executive-produced remakes of &quot;The Wasp Woman&quot;, &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot;, &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Death Artist&quot;), &quot;Piranha&quot; and &quot;Not of this Earth&quot;.

Concorde set up operations in Ireland as Concorde Anois, building studios in Connemara, County Galway. He received some support from the Irish government, a decision which became controversial when the content of some Corman productions such as &quot;Criminal Affairs&quot; was criticized in the press.

Later Concorde-New Horizons films included &quot;Overdrive&quot; (1997). &quot;The genres still hold&quot;, said Corman in 1997, &quot;action adventure, the suspense thriller, science fiction and horror. The difference is that they are bigger and better now. &quot; Corman also produced the film &quot;Moving Target&quot; which was filmed in County Galway. It was his last film produced with Concorde-New Horizons.

== Other ventures ==
=== Roger Corman&#x27;s Cosmic Comics ===
Corman operated a short-lived comic book imprint in 1995–1996 called Roger Corman&#x27;s Cosmic Comics. It produced comics based on his films, written and drawn in a similar no-holds-barred style. Titles included &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Burial of the Rats&quot;, &quot;Caged Heat 3000&quot;, &quot;Death Race 2020&quot;, &quot;Welcome to The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll High School&quot; — the latter featuring the Melvins (instead of the Ramones). Notable creators published by Cosmic Comics included Trevor Goring, James Kochalka, Jason Lutes, Pat Mills, Shane Oakley, Jerry Prosser, and J. R. Williams. The longest-running title was &quot;Death Race 2020&quot;, which lasted eight issues — but was left unfinished when the company closed down.

Corman continued to produce creature films, such as &quot;Raptor&quot; (2001, dir Jim Wynorski). &quot;Dinocroc&quot; (2004), which aired on the Syfy cable television channel and was popular enough for two sequels, &quot;Supergator&quot; and &quot;Dinocroc vs. Supergator&quot; (2010), as well as a spin-off film, &quot;Dinoshark&quot; (2010). &quot;Supergator&quot; (2007) was turned down by the Syfy channel, but Corman made it anyway.

Corman also continued to make action films: &quot;Escape from Afghanistan&quot; (2001) was a Russian film, &quot;Peshavar Waltz&quot; plus some additional footage; &quot;The Hunt for Eagle One&quot; (2006) and &quot;The Hunt for Eagle One: Crash Point&quot; (2006) were shot in the Philippines; &quot;Roger Corman&#x27;s Operation Rogue&quot; (2014); &quot;Fist of the Dragon&quot; (2015).
In 2006, Corman said he made 60% of his films overseas. &quot;These foreign countries are offering subsidies that are so great that not only I but many independent producers are moving overseas&quot;, he said. He sold the remake rights of &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; to Universal, who made &quot;Death Race&quot; (2008) with Jason Statham, with Corman credited as executive producer. It led to two direct-to-video prequels and one direct-to-video sequel.

In 2009, Corman produced and directed alongside director Joe Dante the web series &quot;Splatter&quot; for Netflix. The protagonist of the film is portrayed by Corey Feldman, and the story talks of the haunting tale of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter. He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante&#x27;s web series &quot;Trailers from Hell&quot;. In 2011, Corman cited James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Inception&quot; (2010) as examples of &quot;great imagination and originality&quot;.

By now, the SyFy channel was Corman&#x27;s leading market. For them, he made &quot;Sharktopus&quot; (2010) and &quot;Piranhaconda&quot; (2012). Corman produced the 2017 film &quot;Death Race 2050&quot;, a sequel to the 1975 film &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;. It was made with Universal, Corman&#x27;s first film with a major studio in more than two decades.

== Personal life and death ==
Corman was married to Julie Halloran from 1970 until his death. They had four children. Corman died at his home in Santa Monica, California, on May 9, 2024, at the age of 98.

When Corman&#x27;s death was announced by his family on Corman&#x27;s official Instagram account, his sons were not mentioned in the announcement: &quot;He is survived by his wife Julie and his daughters Catherine and Mary... A devoted and selfless father, he was deeply loved by his daughters.&quot;

=== Legal issues ===
In 2009, Corman was sued by his children, who claimed they had been unfairly fired from the family production business after raising questions about the family trust.

In 2016, Corman alleged in litigation he was owed $170 million against a financial planner.

In 2018, Corman and his wife were sued by their sons over the sale of Corman&#x27;s film library. This case was reportedly settled in February 2020. &quot;It&#x27;s settled and over,&quot; said Corman at the time.

== Awards, recognition, and legacy ==

In 1964, Corman was the youngest producer/director to be given a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, as well as retrospectives at the British Film Institute and the Museum of Modern Art. Corman won the Lifetime Achievement Award at Stockholm International Film Festival in 1990. Corman was the subject of the 1978 documentary &quot;Roger Corman: Hollywood&#x27;s Wild Angel&quot;, produced and directed by Christian Blackwood. Portions of the film reappeared in 2011&#x27;s &quot;Corman&#x27;s World&quot;. He won the first Producer&#x27;s Award ever given by the Cannes Film Festival in 1998.

Corman received the David O. Selznick Award from the Producers Guild of America in 2006. That same year, his film &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot; was among the twenty-five movies selected for the National Film Registry, a compilation of significant films being preserved by the Library of Congress. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Corman with an Academy Honorary Award at the inaugural Governors Awards, on November 14, 2009.

In 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Corman for his BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;, of which the second half of the second episode focuses on Corman. In 2010, Corman was inducted into the Beverly Hills High School Hall of Fame. Corman was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival in 2012. He received the &quot;Extraordinary Contribution to Film&quot; award at the Austin Film Festival in 2018.

Corman was a member of numerous organizations such as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Producers Guild of America as well as New World Pictures, New Concorde, and American International Pictures. Film elements and prints for many movies directed, produced, and/or distributed by Corman are held at the Academy Film Archive as part of the New Horizons Collection. The Academy Film Archive restored Corman&#x27;s film &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; in 2019.

=== The Corman Film School ===
A number of noted filmmakers (including directors, producers, writers, and cinematographers) have worked with Corman, usually early in their careers, including Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Polly Platt, Peter Bogdanovich, Declan O&#x27;Brien, Armondo Linus Acosta, Paul Bartel, Jonathan Demme, Donald G. Jackson, Gale Anne Hurd, Carl Colpaert, Joe Dante, James Cameron, John Sayles, Monte Hellman, Carl Franklin, George Armitage, Jonathan Kaplan, George Hickenlooper, Curtis Hanson, Jack Hill, Robert Towne, Menahem Golan, James Horner, and Timur Bekmambetov. Many have said that Corman&#x27;s influence taught them some of the ins and outs of filmmaking. In the extras for the DVD of &quot;The Terminator&quot;, director James Cameron asserts, &quot;I trained at the Roger Corman Film School.&quot; The British director Nicolas Roeg served as the cinematographer on &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;. Cameron, Coppola, Demme, Hanson, Howard and Scorsese have all gone on to win Academy Awards. Howard was reportedly told by Corman: &quot;If you do a good job on this film, you&#x27;ll never have to work for me again.&quot;

Actors who obtained their career breaks working for Corman include Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, Charles Bronson, Todd Field Michael McDonald, Dennis Hopper, Tommy Lee Jones, Talia Shire, Sandra Bullock, Robert De Niro, and David Carradine, who received one of his first starring film roles in the Corman-produced &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; (1972) and went on to star in &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (along with Sylvester Stallone). Many of Corman&#x27;s protegés have paid their mentor homage by awarding him cameos in films, such as in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, and as recently as the Demme film &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008).

<text>Sceafa ( , also &quot;Scēaf&quot;, &quot;Scēf&quot;) was an ancient Lombardic king in English legend. According to his story, Sceafa appeared mysteriously as a child, coming out of the sea in an empty skiff. The name also appears in the corrupt forms &quot;Seskef&quot;, &quot;Stefius&quot;, &quot;Strephius&quot;, and &quot;Stresaeus&quot;. Though the name has historically been modernized Shava (and Latinized Scefius), J.R.R. Tolkien used the correctly constructed modern English spelling &quot;Sheave&quot;.

==&quot;Widsith&quot;==
The Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot;, line 32, in a listing of famous kings and their countries, has &quot;Sceafa Longbeardum&quot;, so naming Sceafa as ruler of the Lombards. In &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; the Lombards&#x27; origins are traced to an &quot;island&quot; in the north named Scadan or Scandan (&quot;Scandinavia&quot;). But neither this account or any other mentions Sceafa among their later kings or gives the names of any kings that ruled them in the land of their origin where they were said to have been known as the Winnili.

==In genealogies==
Other than this, Sceaf is mentioned only in chronicles tracing the lineage of the English kings, although variants are found in similar genealogies for the rulers of the Danes, Norwegians and Icelanders in the sagas. Most such genealogies stop at the god Odin, but some trace the supposed ancestors of Odin up to a certain Geat. The account in the &quot;Historia Britonum&quot; calls Geat a son of a god. Asser in his &quot;Life of Alfred&quot; writes instead that the pagans worshipped Geat himself for a long time as a god.

Modern scholars speculate on whether this Geat is any eponym of the people known as Geats, or whether it may be the name of a god, or whether it is both. The apparent Old Norse cognate form &quot;Gautr&quot; is a very common byname for Odin. The Icelandic &quot;Herrauðssaga&quot; speaks of King Hring who ruled East Götaland and was son of Gauti son of Odin. Jordanes in his &quot;The origin and deeds of the Goths&quot; traces the line of the Amelungs up to Hulmul son of Gapt, purportedly the first Gothic hero of record. This &quot;Gapt&quot; is felt by many commentators to be an error for &quot;Gaut&quot;.

A few of these genealogies provide mortal ancestors to Geat, tracing his ancestry to Sceaf and then tell of Sceaf&#x27;s origin. Æthelweard in his &quot;Chronica&quot; writes of Sceaf:

This Scef came in a light boat to an island of the ocean which is called Scani, arms around about him, and he was a very young boy, unknown to the dwellers in the land. But he was accepted by them and cared for like one of their own kind, and afterwards they chose him as king, from whose family descended King Æthelwulf.

William of Malmesbury in his &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; wrote:
. . . Sceaf. Iste, ut ferunt, in quondam insulam Germaniae Scandzam (de qua Jordanes, historiographus Gothorum, loquitur) appulsus, navi sine remige, puerulus, posito ad caput frumenti manipulo, dormiens, ideoque Sceaf nuncupatus, ab hominibus regionis illius pro miraculo exceptus, et sedulo nutritus: adulta aetate regnavit in oppido quod tunc Slaswic, nunc vero Haithebi appellatur. Est autem regio illa Anglia Vetus dicta, unde Angli venerunt in Britanniam, inter Saxones et Gothos constituta.
. . . Sceaf; who, as some affirm, was driven on a certain island in Germany, called Scandza, (of which Jordanes, the historian of the Goths, speaks), a little boy in a skiff, without any attendant, asleep, with a handful of corn (barley) at his head, whence he was called Sceaf; and, on account of his singular appearance, being well received by the men of that country, and carefully educated, in his riper age he reigned in a town which was called Slaswic, but at present Haithebi; which country, called old Anglia, whence the Angles came into Britain, is situated between the Saxons and the Goths.

However the genealogy in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; year 855, versions B and C, explains instead that Scef was born in Noah&#x27;s Ark, interpreting Sceaf as Noah&#x27;s fourth non-Biblical son, and then continuing with the ancestry of Noah up to Adam as found in Genesis.

Sceaf is unknown outside of English sources except for one mention in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Prologue to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, which is informed by English sources.

==Scyld Scefing==

===In &quot;Beowulf&quot;===
Older than these is the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; which applies the story of the boy in the boat instead to the Danish hero Scyld (Old Norse &quot;Skjǫldr&quot;), the ancestor of the legendary Danish royal lineage known as the Scyldings (Old Norse &quot;Skjǫldungar&quot;). In the opening lines of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, he is given the epithet &quot;Scefing&quot;, which might mean &#x27;descendant of Scef&#x27;, &#x27;son of Scef&#x27;, or &#x27;of the sheaf&#x27;. The poem itself does not elaborate. But after relating in general terms the glories of Scyld&#x27;s reign, the poet describes Scyld&#x27;s funeral, how his body was laid in a ship surrounded by treasures, the poet explains:
They decked his body no less bountifully
with offerings than those first ones did
who cast him away when he was a child
and launched him alone out over the waves.

No other source relates anything similar about Scyld/Skjöld, so it cannot be known whether this is a case of similar stories being told about two different heroes or whether originally separate figures have been confused with one another.

===A rite involving &quot;scyld&quot; and &quot;sceaf&quot;===
A connection between sheaf and shield appears in the 13th century &quot;Chronicon de Abingdon&quot; which relates a dispute over ownership of a river meadow named Beri between the Abbot of Abingdon and the men of Oxfordshire. The dispute was decided by a ritual in which the monks placed a sheaf (&quot;sceaf&quot;) of wheat on a round shield (&quot;scyld&quot;) and a wax candle upon the sheaf which they lit. They then floated the shield with sheaf and candle on the Thames river to see where it would go. The shield purportedly kept to the middle of the Thames until it arrived at the disputed field, which was then an island because of flooding, whereupon it changed its course and entirely circled the meadow between the Thames and the Iffley.

==Variations on Sceaf&#x27;s lineage==

Æ = Æthelweard&#x27;s &quot;Chronica&quot;.
ASC = &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, year 855 versions B and C. The A version omits the names Hwala, Bedwig, and Scef, almost certainly by accident, so that in that text it is Hrathra who is a son of Noah born in the ark.
Beowulf calls Heremod a Scylding and calls his people were Scyldings, which should mean Heremod was a descendant of Scyld. But that may be anachonistic usage of a common term.
Edda: The forms used indicate an English source. Of the three supposed Norse counterparts, the equation with &quot;Skjöld&quot; is obviously correct, but nothing is otherwise known about Bjárr or this particular Annarr. Seskef (that is Sceaf), in this pseudohistorical account, is son of Magi, son of Móda, son of Vingener, son of Vingethor, son of Einridi, son of Lóridi, son of Thor by Sif, Thor here being the son of Múnón, also called Mennón (equated with Memnon) by Tróan daughter of King Priam of Troy. Lóridi (more often Hlóridi) and Einridi are elsewhere names for Thor himself. The names Magi and Modi resemble the names Magni and Modi given to Thor&#x27;s two sons in other sources. The other names are unique to this list. It is possible that a list of names applied to Thor or connected with Thor may have been at some stage misinterpreted as a lineage or that the names of the descendants of Thor in this list were earlier all applied to sons of Thor.
WM = William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Gesta regum anglorum&quot;.

Scyld is sometimes son of Sceaf and sometimes son of Heremod and a descendant of Scef. William of Malmesbury combines both versions in making Scyld son of Sceaf and Sceaf son of Heremod, but then traces Heremod&#x27;s ancestry up to Strephius, son of Noah, born in the ark, who is obviously Sceaf appearing a second time with corrupt name. Asser in his &quot;Life of Alfred&quot; repeats the listing of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for this section of his genealogy except that he replaces Sceaf altogether with the name Seth and mentions nothing about him being born in the ark. Some modern translations emend Seth to Shem who was son of Noah in the Genesis account.

It is possible that name of &quot;Beaw&quot; the son of Scyld may be a variant of &quot;beow&quot; &#x27;barley&#x27; and that in part these figures derive from rustic folklore about King Sheaf and his son Barley into which the Shield element has intruded. Perhaps a misunderstanding of Scyld Scefing as Scyld the Scefing instead of Scyld of the Sheaf led to the boat story being transferred to Scyld&#x27;s supposed father Sceaf when he became misunderstood as the true first king in the dynasty. There may be confusion between Danish traditions about Scyld/Skjöld and Anglic traditions about Sceaf. There is the possibility that Bedwig son of Sceaf is a corruption of Beaw son of Scyld. Scholars disagree.

For the descendants of Sceaf, only Scyld/Skjöld, Beaw, and Heremod are certainly known elsewhere outside these genealogies, though Hwala or Gwala is possibly the Ecgwela who appears in connection with Heremod in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; in the phrase &quot;offspring of Ecgwela&quot;, apparently a kenning for &quot;Danes&quot;.

==&quot;King Sheave&quot;==

J. R. R. Tolkien treated Sceaf in a poem &quot;King Sheave&quot; which was published after his death in &quot;The Lost Road&quot; in &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot; and very slightly revised and printed as prose in &quot;The Notion Club Papers (Part Two)&quot; in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;.

In Tolkien&#x27;s treatment, a ship drifts to the land of the Longobards in the north. It beaches itself and the folk of that country enter and find a young and handsome boy with dark hair asleep with a &quot;sheaf of corn&quot; as his pillow and a harp beside him. The boy awoke the following day and sang a song in an unknown tongue which drove away all terror from the hearts of those who heard it. They made the boy their king, crowning him with a garland of golden wheat.

Tolkien&#x27;s Sheave fathers seven sons from whence came the Danes, Goths, Swedes, Northmen, Franks, Frisians, Swordmen, Saxons, Swabians, English, and the Langobards.

<doc id="88891" wikidata="Q47793" url="?curid=88891" title="Tilapia">
<text>Tilapia ( ) is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the coelotilapine, coptodonine, heterotilapine, oreochromine, pelmatolapiine, and tilapiine tribes (formerly all were &quot;Tilapiini&quot;), with the economically most important species placed in the Coptodonini and Oreochromini. Tilapia are mainly freshwater fish inhabiting shallow streams, ponds, rivers, and lakes, and less commonly found living in brackish water. Historically, they have been of major importance in artisanal fishing in Africa, and they are of increasing importance in aquaculture and aquaponics. Tilapia can become a problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats such as Australia, whether deliberately or accidentally introduced, but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cold water.

Traditionally a popular and affordable food in the Philippines with a mild taste, tilapia has been the fourth-most consumed fish in the United States since 2002, favored for its low cost and easy preparation. It is commonly fried or broiled as part of a dish.

== Etymology ==
The common name &quot;tilapia&quot; is based on the name of the cichlid genus &quot;Tilapia&quot;, which is itself a latinization of either &quot;tlhapi&quot;, the Tswana word for &quot;fish&quot;, or the Greek word &quot;tilon,&quot; referring to a fish mentioned by Aristotle, combined with &quot;apios,&quot; meaning &quot;distant&quot;. Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith named the genus in 1840.

== History ==
The aquaculture of Nile tilapia dates from Ancient Egypt, where it was represented by the hieroglyph K1, of the Gardiner list: 𓆛.

The fish symbolized rebirth in Egyptian art, and was associated in Egyptian belief-systems with Hathor, goddess of fertility and abundance.
The tilapia was also said to accompany and protect the sun god on his daily journey across the sky.

Tilapia were one of the three main types of fish caught in Talmudic times from the Sea of Galilee, specifically the Galilean comb (&quot;Sarotherodon galilaeus&quot;). It is sometimes known by the name &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s fish&quot;, which comes from the narrative in the Gospel of Matthew about the apostle Peter catching a fish that carried a coin in its mouth. Though the passage does not name the fish, several tilapia species are found in the Sea of Galilee, where the narrative recounts the event took place. These species have been the target of small-scale artisanal fisheries in the area for thousands of years.

== Characteristics ==

Tilapia typically have laterally compressed, deep bodies. Like other cichlids, their lower pharyngeal bones are fused into a single tooth-bearing structure. A complex set of muscles allows the upper and lower pharyngeal bones to be used as a second set of jaws for processing food (cf. morays), allowing a division of labor between the &quot;true jaws&quot; (mandibles) and the &quot;pharyngeal jaws&quot;. This means they are efficient feeders that can capture and process a wide variety of food items. Their mouths are protrusible, usually bordered with wide and often swollen lips. The jaws have conical teeth. Typically, tilapia have a long dorsal fin, and a lateral line that often breaks towards the end of the dorsal fin, and starts again two or three rows of scales below. Some Nile tilapia can grow as long as .

Other than their temperature sensitivity, tilapia exist in or can adapt to a very wide range of conditions. An extreme example is the Salton Sea, where tilapia introduced when the water was merely brackish now live in salt concentrations so high that other marine fish cannot survive.

Tilapia are also known to be mouth-brooding species, which means they carry the fertilized eggs and young fish in their mouths for several days after the yolk sac is absorbed.

== Species ==
Historically, all tilapia have been included in their namesake genus &quot;Tilapia&quot;. In recent decades, some were moved into a few other genera, notably &quot;Oreochromis&quot;, and &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;. Even with this modification, apparently &quot;Tilapia&quot; was strongly poly– or paraphyletic. In 2013, a major taxonomic review resolved this by moving most former &quot;Tilapia&quot; spp. to several other genera. As a consequence, none of the species that are of major economic importance remain in &quot;Tilapia&quot;, but are instead placed in &quot;Coptodon&quot;, &quot;Oreochormis&quot;, and &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;.

=== Exotic and invasive species ===
Tilapia have been used as biological controls for certain aquatic plant problems. They have a preference for a floating aquatic plant, duckweed (&quot;Lemna&quot; spp.), but also consume some filamentous algae. In Kenya, tilapia were introduced to control mosquitoes, which were causing malaria, because they consume mosquito larvae, consequently reducing the numbers of adult female mosquitoes, the vector of the disease. These benefits are, however, frequently outweighed by the negative aspects of tilapia as invasive species.

Tilapia are unable to survive in temperate climates because they require warm water. The pure strain of the blue tilapia, &quot;Oreochromis aureus&quot;, has the greatest cold tolerance and dies at , while all other species of tilapia die at a range of . As a result, they cannot invade temperate habitats and disrupt native ecologies in temperate zones; however, they have spread widely beyond their points of introduction in many fresh and brackish tropical and subtropical habitats, often disrupting native species significantly. Because of this, tilapia are on the IUCN&#x27;s 100 of the World&#x27;s Worst Alien Invasive Species list. In the United States, tilapia are found in much of the south, especially Florida and Texas, and as far north as Idaho, where they survive in power-plant discharge zones. Tilapia are also currently stocked in the Phoenix, Arizona, canal system as an algal growth-control measure. In a Washington, D.C. fishing report from 21 June 2024, it was reported that an angler caught a Tilapia on a crankbait at the Jones Point Park under the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which is on the Potomac River. Many state fish and wildlife agencies in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and elsewhere consider them to be invasive species.

=== Aquarium species ===
Larger tilapia species are generally poor community aquarium fish because they eat plants, dig up the bottom, and fight with other fish. The larger species are often raised as a food source, though, because they grow rapidly and tolerate high stocking densities and poor water quality.

Smaller West African species, such as &quot;Coelotilapia joka&quot; and species from the crater lakes of Cameroon, are more popular as aquarium fish. In specialised cichlid aquaria, tilapia can be mixed successfully with nonterritorial cichlids, armored catfish, tinfoil barbs, garpike, and other robust fish. Some species, including &quot;Heterotilapia buttikoferi&quot;, &quot;Coptodon rendalli&quot;, &quot;Pelmatolapia mariae&quot;, &quot;C. joka&quot;, and the brackish-water &quot;Sarotherodon melanotheron&quot;, have attractive patterns and are quite decorative.

=== Commercial species ===
Tilapia were originally farmed in their native Africa and Levant. Fast-growing, tolerant of stocking density, and adaptable, tilapia have been introduced to and are farmed extensively in many parts of Asia and are increasingly common aquaculture targets elsewhere.

==== Aquaculture ====

Farmed tilapia production in 2002 worldwide was about annually, with an estimated value of US$1.8 billion, about equal to those of salmon and trout.

Unlike carnivorous fish, tilapia can feed on algae or any plant-based food. This reduces the cost of tilapia farming, reduces fishing pressure on prey species, avoids concentrating toxins that accumulate at higher levels of the food chain, and makes tilapia the preferred &quot;aquatic chickens&quot; of the trade.

Because of their large size, rapid growth, and palatability, tilapia cichlids are the focus of major farming efforts, specifically various species of &quot;Oreochromis&quot;, &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;, and &quot;Coptodon&quot; (all were formerly in the namesake genus &quot;Tilapia&quot;). Like other large fish, they are a good source of protein and popular among artisanal and commercial fisheries. Most such fisheries were originally found in Africa, but outdoor fish farms in tropical countries, such as Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Indonesia, are underway in freshwater lakes. In temperate zone localities, tilapiine farming operations require energy to warm the water to tropical temperatures. One method uses waste heat from factories and power stations.

At 1.3 million tonnes per annum, China is the largest tilapia producer in the world, followed by Egypt with 0.5 million. The US, by comparison, produces 10 thousand tonnes against a consumption of 2.5 million.

In modern aquaculture, wild-type Nile tilapia are not too often seen, as the dark color of their flesh is not much desired by many customers, and because it has a bit of a reputation of being a rough fish associated with poverty. However, they are fast-growing and give good fillets; leucistic (&quot;red&quot;) breeds which have lighter meat have been developed and are very popular.

Hybrid stock is also used in aquaculture; Nile × blue tilapia hybrids are usually rather dark, but a light-colored hybrid breed known as &quot;Rocky Mountain White&quot; tilapia is often grown due to its very light flesh and tolerance of low temperatures.

Commercially grown tilapia are almost exclusively male, typically done by adding male sex hormone in the food to the tilapia fry, causing any potential female tilapia to change sex to male. It can also be achieved through hybridization of certain tilapia species or the use of so-called &quot;supermales&quot; that have homozygous male sex chromosomes (resulting in all their offspring receiving a male sex chromosome and thus becoming males). Males are preferred because they grow much faster than females. Additionally, because tilapia are prolific breeders, the presence of female tilapia results in rapidly increasing populations of small fish, rather than a stable population of harvest-size animals.

Tilapia, as a &quot;traditional&quot; dish, was first introduced in the Philippines in 1950 with Mozambique tilapia followed by Nile tilapia in 1972 from Thailand. Strains such as terapon (gunggong) and white goby (biyang puti) were abundant in Laguna de Bay. In 1988, WorldFish, Filipino and Norwegian researchers started aquaculture of the Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT).

Other methods of tilapia population control are polyculture, with predators farmed alongside tilapia or hybridization with other species.

== As food ==

Tilapia, introduced to the state of Tamil Nadu, India in the 1950s as a cheap protein source, quickly spread across the state&#x27;s freshwater bodies because of its ability to thrive in polluted, low-oxygen environments.

The Fisheries Research Committee has recommended the culture of this fish only in areas in the western slopes of the Western Ghats and the coastal strip between Cape Comorin and south of and excluding river Tapti, and in districts of Tinnevellv, Madurai and Ramnad in Madras south of and including river Vaigai. The committee has suggested further investigation to enable it to examine the question of desirability of Tilapia culture in other parts of India.

Whole tilapia fish can be processed into skinless, boneless fillets. In some of the commercial strains, the yield has been reported up to 47% at harvest weight.

Tilapia are among the commercially important aquaculture species that are susceptible to off-flavors (others include trout, barramundi, and channel catfish). These &#x27;muddy&#x27; or &#x27;musty&#x27; flavors are normally caused by geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol, organic products of ubiquitous cyanobacteria that are often present or bloom sporadically in water bodies and soil. These flavors are no indication of freshness or safety of the fish, but they make the product unattractive to consumers. Simple quality-control procedures are known to be effective in ensuring the quality of fish entering the market.

Tilapia have very low levels of mercury. Tilapia are low in saturated fat, calories, carbohydrates, and sodium, and are a good protein source. They also contain the micronutrients phosphorus, niacin, selenium, vitamin B12, and potassium.

Tilapia may be a less nutritious fish than generally believed. The fish&#x27;s omega-3 fatty acid content is often far lower than that of other commonly eaten fish species. Their omega-6 fatty acid levels are unusually high. Multiple studies have evaluated the effects of adding flaxseed derivatives (a vegetable source of omega-3 fatty acids) to the feed of farmed tilapia. These studies have found both the more common omega-3 fatty acid found in the flax, ALA and the two types almost unique to animal sources (DHA and EPA), increased in the fish fed this diet. Guided by these findings, tilapia farming techniques could be adjusted to address the nutritional criticisms directed at the fish, while retaining its advantage as an omnivore capable of feeding on economically and environmentally inexpensive vegetable protein. Adequate diets for salmon and other carnivorous fish can alternatively be formulated from protein sources such as soybean, although soy-based diets with soy oil may also change in the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

== Ecological agent ==
Tilapia serve as a natural, biological control for most aquatic plant problems. They consume floating aquatic plants, such as duckweed watermeal (&quot;Lemna&quot; spp.), most &quot;undesirable&quot; submerged plants, and most forms of algae. In the United States and countries such as Thailand, they are becoming the plant-control method of choice, reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemicals and heavy metal-based algaecides. However, their environmental impact as an invasive species may outweigh their ecological benefit. Their tolerance for a wide range of environmental conditions allow them to thrive in polluted or otherwise degraded aquatic habitats. Arkansas stocks many public ponds and lakes to help with vegetation control. In Kenya, tilapia help control mosquitoes, which carry malaria parasites.

Tilapia can be farmed with shrimp in a symbiotic manner, positively enhancing the productive output of both.

== Medical use ==
In Brazil, Nile tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;) fish skin applied as a bandage is first used in a 2017 clinical trial to treat burn injuries, after successful trial in rats. In the United States, tilapia skin has been used to successfully treat third-degree wounds to the paws of two black bears caught in California&#x27;s Thomas wildfire, and also to treat burns on the paws of a black bear from California&#x27;s Carr wildfire. Nile tilapia skin has completed a phase III clinical trial for superficial partial-thickness burns. The fish skin group showed faster healing, lower pain, reduced dressing changes, and lower treatment costs compared to silver sulfadiazine cream control.

Nile tilapia skin has also been used in neovaginoplasty as a skin graft material, for Müllerian agenesis, vaginal stenosis, and gender-affirming surgery.

The skin-growing properties of tilapia skin are believed to be linked to its high type I collagen content and structural similarities to human skin. The material is also quite strong despite its low thickness. The current procedure for skin use calls for chemical sterilization with chlorhexidine, immersion in glycerol, followed by gamma ray sterilization, plus a few washes with saline in between.

== Parasites ==
As with most fish, tilapia harbor a variety of parasites. For the monogeneans, these especially include species of the megadiverse genus &quot;Cichlidogyrus&quot;, which are gill parasites. Species of &quot;Enterogyrus&quot; are parasites in the digestive system. Tilapia, as important aquaculture fishes, have been introduced widely all over the world, and often carried their monogenean parasites with them. In South China, a 2019 study has shown that nine species of monogeneans were carried by introduced tilapia.

<text>Doris May Lessing ( Tayler; 22 October 1919 – 17 November 2013) was a British novelist. She was born to British parents in Iran, where she lived until 1925. Her family then moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she remained until moving in 1949 to London, England. Her novels include &quot;The Grass Is Singing&quot; (1950), the sequence of five novels collectively called &quot;Children of Violence&quot; (1952–1969), &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot; (1962), &quot;The Good Terrorist&quot; (1985), and five novels collectively known as &quot;Canopus in Argos: Archives&quot; (1979–1983).

Lessing was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature. In awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy described her as &quot;that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny&quot;. Lessing was the oldest person ever to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, at age 87.

In 2001 Lessing was awarded the David Cohen Prize for a lifetime&#x27;s achievement in British literature. In 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; ranked her fifth on a list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Lessing was born Doris May Tayler in Kermanshah, Iran, on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler (née McVeagh), both British subjects. Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in World War I, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was recovering from his amputation. The couple moved to Iran, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia.

In 1925 the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to farm maize and other crops on about of bush that Alfred bought. In the rough environment, his wife Emily aspired to lead an Edwardian lifestyle. It might have been possible had the family been wealthy; in reality, they were short of money and the farm delivered very little income.

As a girl Doris was educated first at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in the Southern Rhodesian capital of Salisbury (now Harare). Then followed a year at Girls High School in Salisbury. She left school at age 13 and was self-educated from then on. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time.

In 1937 Doris moved to Salisbury to work as a telephone operator, and she soon married her first husband, civil servant Frank Wisdom, with whom she had two children (John, 1940–1992, and Jean, born in 1941), before the marriage ended in 1943. Lessing left the family home in 1943, leaving the two children with their father.

=== Move to London; political views ===
After the divorce, Doris&#x27;s interest was drawn to the community around the Left Book Club, an organisation she had joined the year before. It was here that she met her future second husband, Gottfried Lessing. They married shortly after she joined the group, and had a child together (Peter, 1946–2013), before they divorced in 1949. She did not marry again. Lessing also had a love affair with RAF serviceman John Whitehorn (brother of journalist Katharine Whitehorn), who was stationed in Southern Rhodesia, and wrote him ninety letters between 1943 and 1949.

Lessing moved to London in 1949 with her younger son, Peter, to pursue her writing career and socialist beliefs, but left the two older children with their father Frank Wisdom. She later said that at the time she saw no choice: &quot;For a long time I felt I had done a very brave thing. There is nothing more boring for an intelligent woman than to spend endless amounts of time with small children. I felt I wasn&#x27;t the best person to bring them up. I would have ended up an alcoholic or a frustrated intellectual like my mother.&quot;

As well as campaigning against nuclear arms, she was an active opponent of apartheid, which led her to being banned from South Africa and Rhodesia in 1956 for many years. In the same year, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary, she left the Communist Party of Great Britain. In the 1980s, when Lessing was vocal in her opposition to Soviet actions in Afghanistan, she gave her views on feminism, communism and science fiction in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On 21 August 2015, a five-volume secret file on Lessing, built up by both MI5 and MI6, was made public and placed in The National Archives. The file, which contains documents that are redacted in parts, shows Lessing was under surveillance by MI5 and MI6 for around twenty years, from the early-1940s onwards. Her associations with communist organisations and political activism were reported to be the reasons for the surveillance of Lessing.

Disaffected, and turning away from Marxist political philosophy, Lessing became increasingly absorbed with mystical and spiritual matters, devoting herself especially to the Sufi tradition.

===Literary career===
At the age of fifteen, Lessing began to sell her stories to magazines. Her first novel, &quot;The Grass Is Singing&quot;, was published in 1950. The work that gained her international attention, &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot;, was published in 1962. By the time of her death, she had published more than 50 novels, some under a pseudonym.

In 1982 Lessing wrote two novels under the literary pseudonym Jane Somers to show the difficulty new authors face in trying to get their work printed. The novels were rejected by Lessing&#x27;s UK publisher but later accepted by another English publisher, Michael Joseph, and in the US by Alfred A. Knopf. &quot;The Diary of a Good Neighbour&quot; was published in Britain and the US in 1983 and &quot;If the Old Could&quot; in both countries in 1984, both as written by Jane Somers. In 1984 both novels were republished in both countries (Viking Books publishing in the US), this time under one cover, with the title &quot;The Diaries of Jane Somers: The Diary of a Good Neighbour and If the Old Could&quot;, listing Doris Lessing as author.

Lessing declined a damehood (DBE) in 1992 as an honour linked to a non-existent Empire; she had previously declined an OBE in 1977. Later she accepted appointment as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour at the end of 1999 for &quot;conspicuous national service&quot;. She was also made a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature.

In 2007 Lessing was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. She received the prize at the age of 88 years 52 days, making her the oldest winner of the literature prize at the time of the award and the third-oldest Nobel laureate in any category (after Leonid Hurwicz and Raymond Davis Jr.). She was also only the eleventh woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature by the Swedish Academy in its 106-year history. In 2017, just 10 years later, her Nobel medal was put up for auction. Previously only one Nobel medal for literature had been sold at auction, for André Gide in 2016.

===Illness and death===
During the late-1990s Lessing had a stroke, which stopped her from travelling during her later years. She was still able to attend the theatre and opera. She began to focus her mind on death, for example asking herself if she would have time to finish a new book. She died on 17 November 2013, aged 94, at her home in West Hampstead, London, of kidney failure, sepsis and a chest infection, predeceased by her two sons, but was survived by her daughter, Jean, who lives in South Africa.

She was remembered with a humanist funeral service.

==Fiction==

Lessing&#x27;s fiction is commonly divided into three distinct phases.

During her Communist phase (1944–56) she wrote radically about social issues, a theme to which she returned in &quot;The Good Terrorist&quot; (1985). Doris Lessing&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Grass Is Singing&quot;, as well as the short stories later collected in &quot;African Stories&quot;, are set in Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) where she was then living.

This was followed by a psychological phase from 1956 to 1969, including the &quot;Golden Notebook&quot; and the &quot;Children of Violence&quot; quintet.

Third came the Sufi phase, explored in her 70s work, and in the &quot;Canopus in Argos&quot; sequence of science fiction (or as she preferred to put it &quot;space fiction&quot;) novels and novellas.

Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Canopus&quot; sequence received a mixed reception from mainstream literary critics. John Leonard praised her 1980 novel &quot;The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but in 1982 John Leonard wrote in reference to &quot;The Making of the Representative for Planet 8&quot; that &quot;[o]ne of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing... She now propagandises on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz&quot;, to which Lessing replied: &quot;What they didn&#x27;t realise was that in science fiction is some of the best social fiction of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like &quot;Blood Music&quot;, by Greg Bear. He&#x27;s a great writer.&quot; She attended the 1987 World Science Fiction Convention as its Writer Guest of Honor. Here she made a speech in which she described her dystopian novel &quot;Memoirs of a Survivor&quot; as &quot;an attempt at an autobiography&quot;.

The &quot;Canopus in Argos&quot; novels present an advanced interstellar society&#x27;s efforts to accelerate the evolution of other worlds, including Earth. Using Sufi concepts, to which Lessing had been introduced in the mid-1960s by her &quot;good friend and teacher&quot; Idries Shah, the series of novels also uses an approach similar to that employed by the early 20th-century mystic G. I. Gurdjieff in his work &quot;All and Everything&quot;. Earlier works of &quot;inner space&quot; fiction like &quot;Briefing for a Descent into Hell&quot; (1971) and &quot;Memoirs of a Survivor&quot; (1974) also connect to this theme. Lessing&#x27;s interest had turned to Sufism after coming to the realisation that Marxism ignored spiritual matters, leaving her disillusioned.

Lessing&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot; is considered a feminist classic by some scholars, but notably not by the author herself, who later wrote that its theme of mental breakdowns as a means of healing and freeing one&#x27;s self from illusions had been overlooked by critics. She also regretted that critics failed to appreciate the exceptional structure of the novel. She explained in &quot;Walking in the Shade&quot; that she modelled Molly partly on her good friend Joan Rodker, the daughter of the modernist poet and publisher John Rodker.

Lessing did not like being pigeonholed as a feminist author. When asked why, she explained: 

==Doris Lessing Society==
The Doris Lessing Society is dedicated to supporting the scholarly study of Lessing&#x27;s work. The formal structure of the Society dates from January 1977, when the first issue of the &quot;Doris Lessing Newsletter&quot; was published. In 2002 the Newsletter became the academic journal &quot;Doris Lessing Studies&quot;. The Society also organises panels at the Modern Languages Association (MLA) annual Conventions and has held two international conferences in New Orleans in 2004 and Leeds in 2007.

==Archives==
Lessing&#x27;s literary archive is held by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin. The 45 archival boxes of Lessing&#x27;s materials at the Ransom Center contain nearly all of her extant manuscripts and typescripts up to 1999. Original material for Lessing&#x27;s early books is assumed not to exist because she kept none of her early manuscripts. The McFarlin Library at the University of Tulsa holds a smaller collection.

The University of East Anglia&#x27;s British Archive for Contemporary Writing holds Doris Lessing&#x27;s personal archive: a vast collection of professional and personal correspondence, including the Whitehorn letters, a collection of love letters from the 1940s, written when Lessing was still living in Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia). The collection also includes forty years of personal diaries. Some of the archive remains embargoed during the writing of Lessing&#x27;s official biography.

<doc id="88897" wikidata="Q1879787" url="?curid=88897" title="Pygmalion of Tyre">
<text>Pygmalion (Ancient Greek: ; Latin: ) was king of Tyre from 831 to 785 BCE and a son of King Mattan I (840–832 BC).

During Pygmalion&#x27;s reign, Tyre seems to have shifted the heart of its trading empire from the Middle East to the Mediterranean, as can be judged from the building of new colonies including Kition on Cyprus, Sardinia (see Nora Stone discussion below), and, according to tradition, Carthage. For the story surrounding the founding of Carthage, see Dido.

==Name==
The Latin spelling represents the Greek . 

The Greek form of the name has been identified as representing the Phoenician &quot;Pumayyaton&quot; (or ). This name is recorded epigraphically, as , , a theophoric name interpreted as meaning &quot;Pummay has given&quot;. This historical &quot;Pumayyaton&quot; however, was a Cypriot &quot;king of Kition, Idalion and Tamassos&quot;, not of Tyre, and lived several centuries after Pygmalion of Tyre&#x27;s supposed lifetime.
Several scholars have identified Baa‘li-maanzer, the king of Tyre who gave tribute to Shalmaneser III in 841 BC, with &quot;Ba‘al-&#x27;azor&quot; (Phoenician form of the name) or &quot;Baal-Eser/Balazeros&quot; (Greek form of the name), Pygmalion&#x27;s grandfather.

The Nora Stone, discovered in 1773, has also been read as containing the name &quot;Pum(m)ay&quot; (&quot;PMY&quot;) by Frank Moore Cross in 1972. Cross has identified this &quot;PMY&quot; with &quot;Pumayyatan&quot; and further with Pygmalion of Tyre. 
This is highly speculative, and there is no consensus whatsoever on the interpretation of the inscription, not even on whether the text is intended as being read in boustrophedon.

There is also epigraphic attestation of an apparent theonym () found on inscriptions such as the Douïmès medallion. This may either suggest an alternative Phoenician etymology for the name, or 
it may simply be a Phoenician attempt at transliterating the Greek form of the name; though in the case of the Douïmès medallion, the supposed age of the artefact may present some difficulties for the latter hypothesis.

==Date==
Pygmalion&#x27;s dates are derived from Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Against Apion&quot; i.18, where Josephus quotes the Phoenician historian Menander as follows:
Pygmalion . . . lived fifty-six years, and reigned forty-seven years. Now, in the seventh year of his reign, his sister fled away from him, and built the city of Carthage in Libya. 
Pygmalion&#x27;s dates, if this citation is to be trusted, are thus dependent on the date of the founding of Carthage. Here ancient classical sources given two possibilities: 825 BCE or 814 BCE. The 814 date is derived from the Greek historian Timaeus (–260 BCE), and is the more commonly accepted year. The 825 date is taken from the writings of Pompeius Trogus (1st century BCE), whose forty-four book &quot;Philippic History&quot; survives only in abridged form in the works of the Roman historian Justin. In a 1951 article, J. Liver argued that the 825 date has some credibility because, with it, the elapsed time between that date and the start of building of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, given as 143 years and 8 months in Menander/Josephus, agrees very closely with the date of approximately 967 BCE for the start of Temple construction as derived from 1 Kings 6:1 (fourth year of Solomon) and the date given by most historians for the end of Solomon&#x27;s forty-year reign, i.e. 932 or 931 BCE. If, however, the starting place is 814 BCE, measuring back 143 or 144 years does not agree with this Biblical date.

Liver advanced a second reason to favor the 825 date, related to the inscription of Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria, mentioned below, where it was mentioned that philological studies have equated this Ba&#x27;li-manzer with Balazeros (Baal-Eser II), grandfather of Pygmalion. The best texts of Menander/Josephus give six years for Balazeros, followed by nine years for his son and successor Mattenos (Mattan I), making 22 years between the start of Balazeros&#x27;s reign and the seventh year of Pygmalion. If these 22 years are measured back from 814 BCE, they fall short of the 841 date required for Balazeros&#x27;s tribute to Shalmaneser. With the 825 date, however, Balazeros&#x27;s last year would be approximately 841 BCE, the time of the tribute to Shalmaneser.

These two agreements, one with an Assyrian inscription and the other with a Biblical datum, have proved quite convincing to scholars such as J. M. Peñuela, F. M. Cross., and William H. Barnes. Peñuela points out that the following consideration reconciles the two dates for Carthage derived from classical authors: 825 BCE was the year that Dido fled Tyre, and she did not found Carthage until 11 years later, in 814 BCE. Josephus, citing Menander, says that &quot;in the seventh year of [Pygmalion&#x27;s] reign, his sister fled away from him, and built the city of Carthage in Libya&quot; (&quot;Against Apion&quot; i:18). There are two events mentioned here: the flight from Tyre and the founding of Carthage. The language used would suggest that it was the first of these events, Dido&#x27;s flight, that took place in Pygmalion&#x27;s seventh year. Between the two events the following took place: Dido and her ships sailed to Cyprus, where about 80 of the men with her took wives. Eventually the Tyrians arrived on the north coast of Africa, where they received permission to build on an island in the harbor of the place where Carthage was eventually to be built. Peñuela quotes Strabo to show that some time then elapsed before the founding of Carthage: &quot;Carthage was not founded immediately. Indeed, a small island having been captured previously in the Carthaginian harbor, Dido settled there. She fortified the place, which she used as a citadel of war against the Africans, who kept her from the shore.&quot; Justin (18:5 10–17) also mentions the time on this island, which he names as Cothon, and says that Dido and her company built a circle of houses there. Eventually peace was made with the inhabitants on the mainland, and the Tyrians were given permission to build a city. Peñuela maintained that these various events between the departure from Tyre and the eventual rapprochement with the inhabitants on the mainland explain the eleven-year difference between Pompeius Trogus&#x27;s date of 825 BCE and the 814 date derived from other classical authors for Carthage&#x27;s founding.

This understanding of the chronology related to Dido and her company resulted in the following dates for Pygmalion, Dido, and their immediate relations, as derived from F. M. Cross and Wm. H. Barnes:

*Baal-Eser II (Baʿl-mazzer II) 846–841 BCE
*Mattan I 840–832 BCE
*831 BCE: Pygmalion begins to reign
*825 BCE: Dido flees Tyre in 7th year of Pygmalion
*825 BCE and possibly some time thereafter: Dido and companions on Cyprus
*Between 825 BCE and 814 BCE: Tyrians build settlement on island of Cothon
*814 BCE: Dido founds Carthage on mainland
*785 BCE: Death of Pygmalion

==Epigraphic evidence==
===The Nora Stone===

A possible reference to Pygmalion is an interpretation of the Nora Stone, found on Sardinia in 1773 and, though its precise finding place has been forgotten, dated by paleographic methods to the 9th century BCE. 
Frank Moore Cross in 1972 has interpreted the Phoenician inscription on this stone as containing a reference to a king &quot;Pumay&quot;:
:&quot;[ He fought (?) with the Sardinians (?)] at Tarshish and he drove them out. Among the Sardinians he is [now] at peace, (and) his army is at peace: Milkaton son of Shubna (Shebna), general of (king) Pummay.&quot;

In this rendering, Cross has restored the missing top of the tablet (estimated at two lines) based on the content of the rest of the inscription, as referring to a battle that has been fought and won.
Cross conjectured that Tarshish here &quot;is most easily understood as the name of a refinery town in Sardinia, presumably Nora or an ancient site nearby.&quot; 
He takes the (&quot;Pummay&quot;) in the last line as a shortened form of the name of Shubna&#x27;s king, containing only the divine name, a method of shortening &quot;not rare in Phoenician and related Canaanite dialects&quot;.
Since there was only one king of Tyre with this hypocoristicon in the 9th century BCE, Cross restores the name to or , which is rendered in the Greek tradition as Pygmalion. 

There is no consensus whatsoever on the reading of this inscription. Most scholars do not attempt to offer a translation. One alternative interpretation suggests an entirely different meaning: &quot;the text honours a god, most probably in thanks for the traveller&#x27;s safe arrival after a storm&quot;.

===Tribute of Balazeros (Baalimanzer) to Shalmaneser III===
In 1951, Fuad Safar published a record of tribute from Baaʿli-maanzer, king of Tyre, to Shalmaneser III of Assyria in 841 BCE. There followed several studies that attempted to relate this Baaʿli-maanzer to the list of kings given in Menander/Josephus. It was argued, based on philological considerations, that the name as given in the Assyrian text could be matched to a Phoenician and the Greek /, a name corresponding to two kings in Menander&#x27;s list. The first was a son of Hiram I, contemporary of David and Solomon, so this was too early, but the second name referred to the grandfather of Pygmalion and was therefore in the right date range.

<doc id="88901" wikidata="Q1300497" url="?curid=88901" title="Ýdalir">
<text>In Norse mythology, Ýdalir (&quot;yew-dales&quot;) is a location containing a dwelling owned by the god Ullr. Ýdalir is solely attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the implications of the location.

==Attestations==
Ýdalir is solely attested in stanza 5 of the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; (collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;), where Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) tells the young Agnar that Ullr owns a dwelling in Ýdalir. The stanza reads (&quot;Ýdalir&quot; is here translated as &quot;Ydalir&quot;):

:Ydalir it is called, where Ullr
:has himself a dwelling made.
:Alfheim the gods Frey gave
:in days of yore for a tooth-gift.
==Theories==
Discussing Ýdalir, Henry Adams Bellows comments that &quot;the wood of the yew-tree was used for bows in the North just as it was long afterwards for England.&quot; Rudolf Simek says that &quot;this connexion of the god with the yew-tree, of whose wood bows were made (cf. ON &quot;ýbogi&quot; &#x27;yew bow&#x27;), has led to Ullr being seen as a bow-god.&quot; Andy Orchard comments that Ýdalir is an &quot;aptly named dwelling-place [for the] archer-god, Ull.&quot; According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, while Valhalla &quot;is well known because it plays so large a part in images of warfare and death,&quot; the significance of other halls in Norse mythology such as Ýdalir, and the goddess Freyja&#x27;s afterlife location Fólkvangr has been lost.

Udale, located in Cromarty, Scotland, is first recorded in 1578, and is thought to derive from Old Norse &quot;y-dalr&quot;. Robert Bevan-Jones proposes a connection between veneration of Ullr and Ýdalir among the settling pagan Norse in Scotland and their bestowment of the name &quot;ydalr&quot; to the location.

==In popular culture==
Ýdalir was probably the inspiration for the name of a bow in the 1996 Super Famicom game &quot;Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War&quot;. A legendary bow wielded by the crusader Ullr (named after the Norse God) is called , with &quot;Ichii&quot; the Japanese term for &quot;Yew&quot;, and &quot;baru&quot; perhaps a loose Japanese syllabification of the English word &quot;valley.&quot; The same term was used in the 2012 anime &quot;Symphogear&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Ichaival&quot; was added to an English Wikipedia list, but incorrectly presented as a Norse term for a bow of Odin, rather than a Japanese phrase translating Ýdalir&#x27;s meaning of &quot;Yew Dales&quot;. This confusion resulted in the inclusion of &quot;Ichaival&quot; elsewhere as a bow of Odin originating in Norse mythology, notably in the 2014 video game &quot;Smite&quot;. The erroneous term was briefly removed in 2015 but quickly restored; it was removed more finally from the English Wikipedia article in 2018.

The Icelandic heavy metal band Skálmöld released an album titled &quot;Ýdalir&quot; in 2023. The album is inspired by &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and features a title track about the location.

<text>In Norse mythology, Syn (Old Norse: , &quot;refusal&quot;) is a goddess associated with defensive refusal. Syn is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

==Attestations==
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Syn eleventh, and details that she &quot;guards the doors of the hall and shuts them against those who are not to enter&quot;. High additionally states that Syn is &quot;appointed in defense&quot; at things &quot;in legal matters in which she wishes to refute&quot; and that her name is connected to a saying where &quot;a denial (&quot;syn&quot;) is made when one says no.&quot;

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Syn is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names. Syn also appears in two kennings used in works recorded in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;: once for &quot;jötunn&quot; (&quot;hearth-stone-Syn&quot;) in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; by Eilífr Goðrúnarson, and for &quot;woman&quot; (&quot;Syn [woman] of soft necklace-stand [neck]&quot;) in a work attributed to Steinar.

==Theories==
Rudolf Simek says that Syn ranks among the female goddesses whose names are recorded from the &quot;late heathen period&quot;, but that prior to this these goddesses were considered among the collective dísir, and were, in turn, related to the Germanic Matronae.

<text>Space Moose is a Canadian underground comic strip that appeared in the University of Alberta&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Gateway&quot;, between October 3, 1989, and 1999. Almost all of the strips were penned by Adam Thrasher, a student at the university. For career-related reasons, many archives refer to the author by his post-production pen name &quot;Mustafa Al-Habib&quot;. &quot;Macleans Canada&quot; said that &quot;Space Moose&quot; &quot;was deliberately provocative&quot;. Ellen Schoek, the author of &quot;I Was There: A Century of Alumni Stories about the University of Alberta, 1906–2006&quot;, said that &quot;Space Moose&quot; &quot;left no subject unscathed, from fraternities to Christianity and obesity, from sexual proclivities to racism&quot;. In addition to &quot;The Gateway&quot;, the newspapers of the University of Manitoba (&quot;The Manitoban&quot;) and Langara College (&quot;The Gleaner&quot;) also carried &quot;Space Moose&quot;.

The strip follows the adventures of Space Moose, an anthropomorphic, nihilistic moose with asymmetrical eyes and a &quot;Star Trek&quot; uniform, as he violates every behavioral norm and societal taboo he can find. His roommates Marlo Smefner, Billy the Bionic Badger, and Bald Dwarf are often the accomplices or victims of his actions. &quot;Macleans Canada&quot; said that Space Moose was &quot;probably the most famous comic strip character in Canadian university history&quot;.

A book collection, &quot;Triumph of the Whim&quot;, was published in late 1997. It consists of 94 pages of selected existing &quot;Space Moose&quot; cartoons and 6 pages of previously unpublished &quot;Space Moose&quot; strips. Most strips were available on the &quot;Space Moose&quot; web site.

==History==

Thrasher said that he began drawing Space Moose while enrolled at Ross Sheppard High School in Edmonton in order to make a friend laugh. The first &quot;Space Moose&quot; comic premiered in the October 3, 1989, edition of &quot;The Gateway&quot;. In 1991 Thrasher left the University of Alberta and worked for Northwestern Utilities in Edmonton; during the four months he worked with the company, he did not produce any &quot;Space Moose&quot; comics, and the school newspaper replaced Space Moose&#x27;s slot with &quot;Colby Christ&quot;, a comic about Colby Cosh, a friend of Thrasher. When Thrasher returned to the university, &quot;Colby Christ&quot; was replaced by &quot;Space Moose&quot;, which had resumed. Thrasher and Donald R. &quot;Don&quot; Husereau drew &quot;Colby Christ meets Space Moose&quot;, a strip that was a segue between the series.

In 1997, Space Moose ran for Students&#x27; Union President and finished a close third with 1,400 votes (only 11 votes behind the second place candidate, Hoops Harrison). This led to changes being made in students&#x27; union rules that would prevent any future &quot;joke&quot; candidate from actually winning an election. Due to the increasing popularity of the cartoon, people took away Space Moose&#x27;s campaign posters as collector&#x27;s items.

Around 1997, the comic received 10,000 visits per month. In 1997, due to a controversy involving the strip &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;, the comic was moved from University of Alberta biomedical department servers to private servers. Thrasher said that Darkcore Networks, a web host in Edmonton and a subsidiary of OA Internet, one of the largest internet service providers in Edmonton, invited Thrasher to post his comics there. Thrasher established a new website which housed over 170 &quot;Space Moose&quot; comic strips, including &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;. The website included an advertising banner from Microsoft. It also had a hit counter which, as of September 10, 1998, stated that the site had been accessed 17,800 times since November 1997. The website included a section called &quot;Clobberin, about the controversial comic strip. The section invited readers to &quot;fume with the feminists who banned &quot;Space Moose&quot; from the university network&quot;.

A cartoon that was printed in &quot;The Gateway&quot;, &quot;Antlers of the Damned&quot;, depicting an angel and featuring a dog sodomizing Space Moose. As a result, the University of Alberta campus chaplains published a joint letter of recrimination. Another &quot;Space Moose&quot; cartoon, that depicted Snow White facing sodomy at the hands of the Seven Dwarves, was published in &quot;Slur&quot;, a punkzine. As a result, A&amp;B Sound withdrew its advertising from &quot;Slur&quot; and banned the magazine from its stores.

===Author biography===
Thrasher was born on September 9, 1971, in London, Ontario. He and his family moved to Edmonton when he was 10 years old. Thrasher received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta in 1994. Thrasher was scheduled to receive his doctorate in 2000. Cosh said &quot;His need to complete his doctoral thesis explains the shocking paucity of strips in 1999.&quot; He received his PhD in medical sciences in 2002. As of 2011 Thrasher is now a professor at the University of Houston.

===&quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot; controversy===
&quot;Macleans Canada&quot; stated that the most controversial strip in &quot;Space Moose&quot;&#x27;s history was &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;, which satirized the Take Back the Night march, an annual event held on Jasper Avenue in Edmonton to protest violence perpetrated by men against women. In that strip Space Moose prepares to attack demonstrators, and opens fire on women in the rally while using a machine gun, hitting his targets. A large masculine-appearing woman captures Space Moose, and in the following strip he is incarcerated in a &quot;Womyn&#x27;s Studies re-education camp&quot;. There he is forced to constantly watch reruns of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;.

In October 1997, &quot;The Gateway&quot; refused to publish the strip &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;. The strip was nevertheless available on the cartoonist&#x27;s web site, which was hosted on university servers, and &quot;The Gateway&quot; mentioned the URL which led to the comic strip. The strip&#x27;s presence ignited a controversy across many campuses.

Nine women said that they felt frightened by the strip, and asked the university administration to take action. The women, including faculty and students, wrote ten letters to the president of the University of Alberta. One of the complainants, a University of Alberta political science professor named Linda Trimble, said that &quot;I was shocked. I was upset. I was amazed that someone would draw such a misogynist, hateful cartoon. This is trivialization of a hate crime.&quot; The university governed the web servers which hosted &quot;Space Moose&quot;, so it took action to remove the comic from its servers. Burton Smith, the acting dean of students, said that the administration asked Thrasher to voluntarily remove the comic strip from the university servers, and that if he did so, he would continue to be able to use his university computer account. Thrasher moved his comic to a privately hosted web server in Edmonton. The controversy garnered media attention throughout Canada. Thrasher said &quot;I&#x27;m an underground cartoonist -- I&#x27;ve always tried to keep a low profile.&quot;

Some members of the University of Alberta community complained about the activities of &quot;The Gateway&quot; in relation to the controversy to the university administration. The University of Alberta had no editorial control over &quot;The Gateway&quot;, and by law the publisher, the University of Alberta Students&#x27; Union, was responsible for the production. The Universities Act of the Province of Alberta dictated that the student union was a corporate body separate from the university. Therefore, Burton Smith asked that complaints about the newspaper&#x27;s activities be directed to the union, rather than to the university administration.

====Disciplinary proceeding and appeal====
The administration started disciplinary proceedings against Thrasher. In December 1997 the administration charged Thrasher with discrimination against women as per the university&#x27;s code of student conduct. The author was sent to a university disciplinary hearing. On December 15, 1997, Gretchen C. Hess, the university&#x27;s discipline officer, reviewed the university&#x27;s charges. Hess declared Thrasher guilty of violating s. 30A.3.2 of the Code of Student Behaviour, and the university punished Thrasher by issuing him a written reprimand that said &quot;We reprimand Mr. Thrasher for failing to treat women with dignity and respect. In future, Mr. Thrasher should be more sensitive to some members of his reading audience in his depiction of issues&quot; and that he would be fined $200 ($ when adjusted for inflation) by making a contribution of that amount to the Graduate Students&#x27; Association Food Bank. After the fine was announced, Thrasher said that he had no intention of immediately paying the fine and that he would seek legal advice from Student Legal Services. He also stated that he had no intention of withdrawing from the university.

On January 23, 1998, Thrasher filed an appeal against the university&#x27;s decision. The appeal hearing began on Monday September 28, 1998. It was supposed to conclude that afternoon, but the meeting ran too long and had to be adjourned. The meeting was scheduled to conclude on Thursday October 8, 1998. Five of the women who had initially sent complaints against Thrasher testified during the appeal hearing. The appeal process was completed on Monday November 2, 1998, with the university overturning the charges against Thrasher. The front page of the November 5, 1998 &quot;The Gateway&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Space Moose&quot; Beats the Rap&quot;. According to Thrasher, he spent around $300 ($ when adjusted for inflation), which was more than the fine, even though his lawyer had worked &quot;pro bono&quot;. Thrasher said that he spent the money on the appeals because he was attacking censorship and that he, as an artist, had a responsibility to do so. The University Appeal Board announced that it reversed the punishment decision on November 20, 1998.

====Interpretation and reception====
Adam Thrasher argued that the &quot;Take Back the Night&quot; marches cause polarization in gender relations, since women discourage men from participating. Thrasher said, as paraphrased by Dan Lazin of &quot;The Gateway&quot;, that &quot;unthinking men may be incited to further hatred towards women.&quot; Thrasher argued that while the strips criticize &quot;the ideas of some hard-core feminists&quot;, they are not against all women. Thrasher added that &quot;The reason I did it is because it&#x27;s such a taboo to make fun of violence against women, against Take Back the Night.&quot; Thrasher also stated that &quot;When I drew up the cartoon, I wasn&#x27;t thinking about Marc Lepine [and the Montreal massacre] which was a crime against humanity, I think, more than a crime against women.&quot;

A Saturday October 25, 1997, editorial of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; argued that the actions against Thrasher were censorship and that &quot;the instinct to block the juvenile humour was more disturbing than the juvenalia itself.&quot; The &quot;Alberta Report&quot; said in 1997 that &quot;&quot;Space Moose&quot; is a festival of caricatured scatology, violence, perversion, irreligion and even pedophilia. It has stimulated outrage before, but in five years the university had never suppressed the strip, despite lampoons of University institutions, Trekkies, the mentally retarded, and Christians. Only one group, it seems, has the clout to make the university turn censor.&quot;

In response to Thrasher&#x27;s argument that the marches could polarize gender relations and that the comic had a different message than perceived, Gretchen Hess said that the intent of the strip was not easily discernible and that the effect of the strip should be considered in addition to the intent. Linda Trimble argued that &quot;[t]he pretty direct message of the cartoon [was] &#x27;It&#x27;s open season on feminists. Kill all the women. Joyce Green, a University of Regina political science professor who was another complainant, argued that &quot;I don&#x27;t see any difference between [the Montreal Massacre] and the cartoon.&quot; Green added that the group had complained about the strips &quot;not because we&#x27;re paranoid but because we&#x27;re terrified.&quot; Shannon Sampert, a political science student who was another one of the complainants, said that she was not surprised that the appeal went in favor of Thrasher. She believed that additional students would try to take the course of action that Thrasher took, and she believed that feminists would cause an outcry against the appeals.

Brice Smith, a graduate student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Physics, said in &quot;The Tech&quot; in 2001 that &quot;[t]he first strip, taken alone, would have been a brilliant use of sarcasm that very sharply points out the need for such events&quot;, but that the second strip &quot;mocks the women’s demands to feel safe and to be free from rape, and then follows this up with the men brutally attacking the women, killing many quite graphically[...]&quot; Brice Smith argued that &quot;One almost does not even know where to begin addressing this kind of hate-filled message. For me, the most horrifying aspect is its total disregard for the very real extent of violence by men against women.&quot;

In regards to the university code of conduct, Green and Trimble argued that it needed to be amended so that it would prohibit future strips like &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;. Thrasher said that the code was unclear, even though it does not remove rights from the university community or members of the university. Thrasher argued that the code needed to be amended to make it clearer. In regards to the inclusion of the URL in &quot;The Gateway&quot;, Sampert argued that the editors &quot;did a really scabby way of censoring but promoting at the same time.&quot; Rose Yewchuk, the editor of &quot;The Gateway&quot;, argued that the &quot;Space Moose&quot; comic that was published in that issue would not have made sense to the reader unless the reader saw the previous comic, therefore the newspaper published the address.

==Development==
&quot;Space Moose&quot; was originally created for the entertainment of Paul Diedrich, a friend of Thrasher. Diedrich coined the name &quot;Space Moose&quot;. Thrasher said &quot;I drew this thing with all the stereotypes of a goofy character--lopsided googly eyes, buck teeth that hang out, and antlers.&quot; At first, &quot;Space Moose&quot; was a collaboration between Thrasher, Thrasher&#x27;s friend Jason Kapalka, and Donald R. &quot;Don&quot; Husereau, a pharmacy student. After drawing one &quot;Space Moose&quot; cartoon, Husereau left the strip&#x27;s production but continued to be an advisor. For the first year, Thrasher collaborated with friend Jason Kapalka. After the first year, Thrasher did the strip alone.

Originally Thrasher used materials from his mother&#x27;s office to create the comics. As the comic progressed, he began using a black Sanford uniball to ink. The creator pencilled lightly with a very hard lead, such as a 5H. The paper used was ordinary sets of bleached paper. In addition Thrasher used a portable drawing board with a T-square.

Thrasher said &quot;My cartoons, more often than not, challenge the reader to think about things that are horrible, reprehensible and irredeemable. If I have achieved that, there seems to be only two possible reactions: anger or laughter. I aim for the latter and put up with the former.&quot;

Thrasher said that his influences include Scott Adams, author of &quot;Dilbert&quot;; Matt Groening, author of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; and Gary Larson, author of &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Colby Cosh said &quot;[h]e&#x27;s glad they pushed the envelope to allow biting cartoonists such as him to thrive.&quot; Thrasher said &quot;When I grew up, newspaper comics were sickly sweet.&quot; Thrasher believed that &quot;Family Circus&quot;, &quot;Marmaduke&quot;, and &quot;Ziggy&quot; were &quot;offensively lame&quot;.

The first year of &quot;Space Moose&quot; had obscure references to many Edmonton-based bulletin board system participants. Cosh said &quot;That&#x27;s why those strips mostly make no sense. They&#x27;re in-jokes that got into the campus paper for some reason. Quality control was a real problem then, as now.&quot; Cosh added &quot;Adam would prefer that you just ignore the 1989–90 episodes of Space Moose. With respect to Jason Kapalka&#x27;s gag writing, the real jumping-off point for &quot;Space Moose&quot; is the ingenious &quot;Calvin and Slobbes&quot;, the first strip of 1990–91.&quot;

Originally &quot;Space Moose&quot; had a head of hair. In 1993 Thrasher dropped the hair, because he felt the character looked better with a bald head. Thrasher added &quot;Sometimes, the hair is useful--for example, in the &quot;Summertime tips&quot; strip, where he slicked it back to look suave, or in &quot;Extreme Space Moose,&quot; where the mane looks like fire and adds intensity to the drawing.&quot;

The word &quot;bee&quot; often occurs in the strip, and sometimes a developmentally disabled man appears. This is based on Thrasher&#x27;s experience while riding on a school bus with a boy with Down syndrome. The boy often sung softly; Thrasher later learned that the boy was trying to say the word &quot;bee&quot; using different pitches and tones. After the discovery, Thrasher decided to introduce the word in his vocabulary, with different tones leading to different meanings.

==Characters==
* Space Moose - Space Moose is an anthropomorphic, nihilistic moose with asymmetrical eyes and a Star Trek uniform who violates every behavioral norm and societal taboo he can find. A native of the planet Olmak, he was sent to earth and raised by the Moose family in Canada. Moose chose to attend the University of Alberta. Thrasher said &quot;Four years later, with a zoology degree in hand, Space Moose made his boyhood dreams come true and became the Generation X version of Merlin Perkins.&quot; In the &quot;Space Moose&quot; FAQ, when asked about Space Moose&#x27;s sexuality, Thrasher said &quot;My personal opinion is that Space Moose simply likes illicit sex. Since gay coitus is so taboo (and since most of his friends happen to be male), that is the brand he most often indulges in. Still, he is not exclusively gay, because he hits on Miranda [...] and he fantasizes about screwing women [...].&quot; Thrasher explained that Space Moose believes that &quot;[...] the best sex is sex that is perceived as wrong or inappropriate. Missexual?&quot; Colby Cosh, a friend of Thrasher, said that in his view, &quot;Space Moose was basically heterosexual but would do ANYTHING to create chaos.&quot; Cosh explained, &quot;Chicks are what gives him spontaneous erections in shopping malls [cf. &quot;Saved by the fat fuck&quot;], but he&#x27;ll drill glory holes in his own walls to piss people off [cf. &quot;Glory holes&quot;]. Obviously he does have a thing about anuses (ani?), but so do a lot of heterosexuals. Of course, there&#x27;s also the fact that he is neither human nor even of Earthly origin. &quot;Missexual&quot; is definitely the best formulation I have seen.&quot; In 1997, Thrasher conducted a World Wide Web poll on Space Moose&#x27;s sexuality. 42% of respondents said that it was &quot;undefinable&quot;. 24% said &quot;bisexual&quot;. 3% each said that Space Moose was &quot;homosexual&quot; and &quot;asexual&quot;. Space Moose&#x27;s Star Trek shirt had been coloured differently in different strips. Thrasher said &quot;Since the colourizers can&#x27;t even agree on Space Moose&#x27;s own exact hue, and since Space Moose has never been given a formal Starfleet rank, speculation may proceed freely.&quot;
* Marlo Smefner - Thrasher said &quot;Of Space Moose&#x27;s cohorts, Marlo is probably the most normal&quot; and &quot;Having had somewhat of a moral upbringing, Marlo does not agree with Space&#x27;s seek-and-destroy philosophy of life, and tries to curb the antlered one&#x27;s nihilistic ventures whenever possible. Despite the animosity between them, Space Moose cannot help but see a little of himself in Marlo.&quot; Thrasher introduced Marlo in 1994. At first Thrasher intended for Marlo to be a one-time character, but then he realized that he could act as the comic&#x27;s straight man. Several commentators asked Thrasher whether Marlo is supposed to represent him. Cosh explained &quot;This may be because Adam often disavows Space Moose&#x27;s own outlook on life.&quot; Thrasher responded that Marlo is not an avatar of himself.
* Billy the Bionic Badger - Billy, a honey badger, met Space Moose at the University of Alberta while participating in the university&#x27;s engineering program. Thrasher said that Billy &quot;underwent a series of surgeries which eventually replaced all his skeletal muscles with advanced silicon polymer servo-actuators, rendering him the world&#x27;s strongest rodent.&quot; Cosh noted on the &quot;Space Moose&quot; FAQ that Thrasher was aware that badgers are not actually rodents.
* Bald Dwarf - A small man who attended the University of Alberta, Bald Dwarf often organizes equal rights parades for various socioeconomic groups.

<text>Symphysodon (colloquially known as discus or discus fish) is a genus of cichlids native to the Amazon river basin in Brazil. Due to their distinctive shape, calm behavior, many bright colors and patterns, and dedicated parenting techniques, discus are popular as freshwater aquarium fish, and their aquaculture in several countries in Asia (notably Thailand) is a major industry. They are sometimes referred to as pompadour fish. The discus fish has attracted a cult following of collectors and has created a multimillion dollar international industry complete with shows, competitions, and reputable online breeders.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;symphysodon&quot;, which was coined in 1840 by Johann Jakob Heckel, refers to the unusual symphysis of the teeth (&quot;-odon&quot; from Greek ὀδών, tooth).

== Species ==
Following a review published in 2006, three species are recognized by FishBase:
==Taxonomy==

Discus are fish from the genus &quot;Symphysodon&quot;, which currently includes the species &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot;, &quot;S. discus&quot; and &quot;S. tarzoo&quot;, based on a taxonomic review published in 2006. A review published in 2007 largely came to the same result, but differed in nomenclature, as the species called &quot;S. tarzoo&quot; in the 2006 study was called &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; in the 2007 study, and &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; in 2006 was &quot;S. haraldi&quot; in 2007. Further arguments have been made that &quot;S. tarzoo&quot; was not described in accordance with ICZN rules and thus should be considered invalid and replaced with &quot;S. haraldi&quot;, currently considered a synonym of &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; by FishBase.

Other species and subspecies have been proposed, but morphometric data (unlike in &quot;Pterophyllum&quot;, the freshwater angelfish) varies as much between individuals from one location as across the whole range of all discus fish species. &quot;S. tarzoo&quot; was described in 1959 and applies to the red-spotted western population. &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; and &quot;S. discus&quot;, meanwhile, seem to hybridise frequently in the wild or have diverged recently, as they lack mitochondrial DNA lineage sorting but differ in color pattern and have dissimilar chromosomal translocation patterns. &quot;S. discus&quot; occurs mainly in the Rio Negro. Whether &quot;S. haraldi&quot; is indeed distinct from &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; remains to be determined; if valid it is widespread but it might just be a color morph.
A molecular study in 2011 found five main groups, which generally matched previously recognized phenotypes. They recognized them as evolutionarily significant units and species. Their assigning of scientific names to species differed to some extent from that used by earlier authors: Heckel (&quot;S. discus&quot;; Rio Negro, upper Uatumã, Nhamundá, Trombetas and Abacaxis), green (&quot;S. tarzoo&quot;; West Amazon drainages upriver from the Purus Arch, blue (&quot;S.&quot; sp. 1; central Amazon from Purus Arch to the Meeting of Waters), brown (&quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot;; East Amazon downriver from Meeting of Waters), Xingu group (&quot;S.&quot; sp. 2; Xingu and Tocantins). The Xingu group currently lacks a scientific name, but it is possible that the correct name for the blue is &quot;S. haraldi&quot;. This taxonomy with four described valid species, &quot;S. discus&quot;, &quot;S. tarzoo&quot;, &quot;S. haraldi&quot; and &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot;, has been adopted by the Catalog of Fishes. Some hybridisation occurs (or has occurred) between the brown discus and neighbouring forms, but overall they maintain their separate evolutionary trajectories.

In addition to the wild discus, several captive variants achieved by selective breeding exist. Based on RAPD sequences, the captive variants popularly known as turquoise, pigeon, ghost, cobalt and solid red are derived from wild green, blue and brown discus (not Heckel discus).

==Description==

Like cichlids from the genus &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; (angelfish), all &quot;Symphysodon&quot; species have a laterally compressed body shape. In contrast to &quot;Pterophyllum&quot;, however, extended finnage is absent giving &quot;Symphysodon&quot; a more rounded shape. It is this body shape from which their common name, &quot;discus&quot;, is derived. The sides of the fish are frequently patterned in shades of green, red, brown, and blue. Some of the more brightly marked variants are the result of selective breeding by aquarists and do not exist in the wild. Discus typically reach up to in length, but captives have been claimed to reach . Adults generally weigh . Discus fish exhibit no sexual dimorphism when they are under about 4 inches in size, making it difficult to distinguish between males and females at a young age. Once they reach this size, the shape of their dorsal fins begins to change, with females retaining rounder dorsal fins and males developing more pointed ones. Other subtle indicators of sex include the overall size, as males are usually larger, and the thickness of their lips, with males often having thicker lips used for fighting. Despite these clues, none of these characteristics are guaranteed indicators of sex. The only definitive way to confirm the sex of discus fish is by observing spawning behavior, where a female lays eggs and a male swims over to fertilize them.

==Behavior==

&quot;Symphysodon&quot; spp. are highly social, typically occurring in groups that may number many dozens of individuals, which is unique among cichlids of the Americas. When breeding, the pair moves away from the group, possibly to reduce the risk of cannibalism of the young. As with most cichlids, brood care is highly developed with both the parents caring for the young. Additionally, adult discus produce a secretion (&quot;discus milk&quot;) through their skin, on which the larvae live during their first 4 weeks. During the first two weeks, the parents stay near their young allowing them to feed easily. In the last 2 weeks, they swim away, resulting in the young being gradually &quot;weaned off&quot; and starting to fend for themselves. Although rare in fish, more than 30 species of cichlids are known to feed their young with skin secretion to various extent, including &quot;Pseudetroplus&quot; and &quot;Uaru&quot; species. Sexual maturity is reached in a year.

Research has shown that, through this unique parental care behaviour (discus parents feeding their progeny with skin mucus), discus fish parents transmit key microorganisms to their fry. This parent-to-offspring transmission of important microorganisms might explain the high survival rate of discus fry raised with their parents, compared to the low survival rate of progeny raised artificially by fish breeders (e.g. on egg yolk, brine shrimp, or other replacement foods).

&quot;Symphysodon&quot; spp. primarily feed on algae, other plant material, and detritus (periphyton), but also eat small invertebrates. Invertebrates can make up 38% of the stomach content in wild &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; during the high-water season, but this decreases during the low-water season, and year-round it is generally lower in the other species. Unlike more predatory cichlids, &quot;Symphysodon&quot; spp. have relatively long intestines typical of a herbivore or omnivore.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Symphysodon&quot; species inhabit the margins of floodplain lakes and rivers in the lowland Amazon basin, where they are part of the highly diverse Neotropical fish fauna. &quot;S. discus&quot; is restricted to blackwater habitats, but periodically these may experience brief floods of whitewater. &quot;S. tarzoo&quot; is found in both black and whitewater, and &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; also occurs in clearwater. Because of their preference for lentic habitats such as floodplains and flooded forests, whitewater inhabited by discus contains little suspended material (unlike main sections of whitewater rivers).

The three species of &quot;Symphysodon&quot; have different geographic distributions. &quot;S. aequifasciatus&quot; occurs in the East Amazon downriver from the Purus Arch and &quot;S. tarzoo&quot; in the West Amazon upriver from the Purus Arch. In contrast, the distribution of &quot;S. discus&quot; appears to be limited to the lower reaches of the Rio Negro, upper Uatumã, Nhamundá, Trombetas, and Abacaxis Rivers.

The Nanay River in far western Amazonas is outside the native range; discus in this river were introduced from stock originating in the Tefé area by an aquarium exporter more than 30 years ago.

A significant number of discus now live in fish farms in Southeast Asia. These discus go to home aquaria around the world.

==Home aquarium==
Discus are kept by fishkeepers in the home aquarium, where they are valued for their striking appearance. They are considered difficult to keep, due to strict requirements for water quality and the need to be kept in groups. Breeders have selected for individuals with more adaptability to tap water conditions.

In home aquariums, discus live for an average of 10 years, but can live up to 15 years, and can grow up to 8 inches. Like many fish in the home aquarium, they will eat almost anything that fits within their mouth. Due to their size, they often require a minimum – aquarium.

Each year the World Discus Competition takes place in Guangzhou, China. The North American Discus Association focuses on both supporting hobbyists and helping to support wild discus.

<text>Milngavie ( ; ) is a town in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland and a suburb of Glasgow. It is on the Allander Water, at the northwestern edge of Greater Glasgow, and about from Glasgow city centre. It neighbours Bearsden. Milngavie is a commuter town, with much of its working population travelling to Glasgow to work or study. The town is served by Milngavie railway station on the North Clyde Line of the SPT rail network, which links it to Central Glasgow.

In 2018, the Scottish Government published statistics for the town showing that the population increased to 13,537 in 6,062 households. The town is also a popular retirement location, with a high number of elderly people living there.

The &quot;Milngavie and Bearsden Herald&quot;, owned by Johnston Press, is a weekly newspaper that covers local events from the schools, town halls, community and government in the area. The paper was established in 1901 and is printed every Wednesday, to be sold on Thursdays.

The town is the start point of the West Highland Way long distance footpath which runs northwards for to the town of Fort William. A granite obelisk in the town centre marks the official starting point of the footpath.

== History ==
Milngavie&#x27;s name is of Gaelic origin, and may mean either &quot;windmill&quot; () or &quot;windy hill&quot; (). The town grew from a country village in the parish of New Kilpatrick to a minor industrial centre in the nineteenth century, with paper mills and bleach works on the Allander River to the north-west of the town centre. Some remnants of this industry remain today on the Cloberfield Industrial Estate. The land surrounding the village comprised several estates with tenant farms, amongst them Barloch, Clober, Craigton, Craigdhu, Dougalston, Douglas Mains and South Mains.

Stone-built villas and semi-detached houses were constructed for wealthy citizens to the east of the town centre and around Tannoch Loch when commuting to Glasgow was made possible by the opening of the railway which reached the town in 1863.
After World War II a local authority housing scheme was built to the west of the town centre, housing many people relocated from Clydebank which had been badly bombed. The town grew with the addition of private speculative housing developments of bungalows and semi-detached homes at South Mains to the south of the town centre and around Clober, to the west, in the 1950s and 1960s.

The town was historically served by routes 13 and 14 of the extensive Glasgow tramway system. Tramway services in Milngavie were withdrawn in 1956 and the entire system was dismantled by September 1962.

The Fairways estate was built, starting in 1977 and continued into the 1980s.

The town centre was redeveloped to improve traffic flow and pedestrian safety. The central commercial streets were pedestrianised starting in 1974 and many buildings were replaced. A superstore was opened on the fringes of the town centre in the 1990s.

In 2008, residents launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign to bring the Olympic games to Milngavie in 2020.

Today the town is primarily a dormitory town for the nearby city of Glasgow.

== Governance ==
Milngavie, originally in Stirlingshire, was in an area that became an exclave of Dunbartonshire on the orders of King David II (1324–1371). In 1875, whilst remaining part of Dunbartonshire, it became a police burgh under the jurisdiction of the Stirlingshire constabulary and retained burgh status for 100 years until 1975 when it was absorbed into the newly created Strathclyde Region.

Milngavie is located to the north of the neighbouring town of Bearsden. Although the two are in close proximity, the social histories of these two towns differ significantly. Bearsden grew almost exclusively as a dormitory town of Glasgow for the wealthy and professional classes. In that sense both towns now fulfil a similar role. The two became a single local authority district in 1975, before Scottish Local Government reorganisation in the 1990s re-integrated them with the towns of Kirkintilloch and Bishopbriggs, to form the East Dunbartonshire administrative area.

In 2014, businesses in Milngavie voted in favour of becoming a Business Improvement District (BID) to work with East Dunbartonshire Council and community groups to improve the town and commercial viability of the central pedestrianised business area. 

== Landmarks ==
Little remains of the pre-nineteenth century village other than the Corbie Ha&#x27; meeting hall, Cross Keys Public House, although now renovated and renamed, and the Gavin&#x27;s Mill water mill on the Allander Water along with Barloch House and Barloch Farm.

There are a few good examples of nineteenth century stone villas along the Station Road as well as the well preserved nineteenth century railway station. Many interesting Victorian houses around the Tannoch Conservation Area show Scottish cottage, Scottish Baronial, Classical architecture and Gothic influences. The town centre and Strathblane Road have remaining Victorian shop/tenement buildings and a few Arts and crafts influenced commercial buildings. Craigmillar Avenue and the area around Baldernock Road have some large Arts and Crafts and Glasgow Style influenced houses. 
The bulk of the housing stock is twentieth century, showing Scottish vernacular influences such as harling or rough-casting, and, occasionally, more traditionally English elements like black and white timber paneled dormer windows and gables.

The public sheltered housing projects of the 1970s and 1980s are interesting for their attempts to use traditional local materials like grey rough-cast and slate plus interesting rounded walls and pitched roofs.

The most recent development is characterised by some interesting one-off conversions and extensions to Victorian properties; new housing by developers that often follows designs based on the brick architecture of the South of England; and contemporary steel framed commercial and leisure buildings.

The Milngavie reservoir is visited by tourists and walkers. The reservoir is made up of the Craigmaddie and Mugdock reservoirs and was opened in 1859 by Queen Victoria. It is the main supplier of water to the city of Glasgow and can hold up to of water.

The war memorial is by George Henry Paulin.

The Auld Wives&#x27; Lifts, an interesting natural rock feature, is located on Craigmaddie Muir to the north east of Milngavie.

* Milngavie United Free Church of Scotland
* St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church
* St. Luke&#x27;s Church of Scotland
* St. Paul&#x27;s Church of Scotland

Originally Milngavie was in the Parish of New Kilpatrick, the church being that of New Kilpatrick in Bearsden, with no formal place of worship in the town until the eighteenth century.
Milngavie now has three stone built churches dating from the early twentieth century within 500 m of each other. Until the 1970s these three were all Church of Scotland congregations (those of St.Paul&#x27;s, Cairns, and St.Luke&#x27;s) in consequence of the history of the Kirk (Church of Scotland) which saw a multitude of factions and congregations organise, each with varying forms of worship and constitutional arrangements, and which subsequently re-integrated. St.Paul&#x27;s was always in the fold of the Church of Scotland and is now the parish church of Milngavie. It was originally housed in a simple grey stone church building above the Station Road beside the Milngavie Primary School before moving to a handsome red sandstone building on the Strathblane Road in 1906. The original building is now apartments. From 1799 Cairns Church had been located in a building on Mugdock Road close to the &#x27;preaching braes&#x27; on Barloch Moor where the congregation&#x27;s first services had taken place. It moved to its present building on Buchanan Street in 1903 which displays elements of the Glasgow Style of architecture and design. St.Luke&#x27;s had been built as the Milngavie United Free Church. In the 1970s it was decided that the concentration of churches in one area should be reviewed and a new St. Lukes was built on the western side of the town to serve the residents of Clober. The Roman Catholic Church bought the old St.Luke&#x27;s Church and moved their congregation to the new premises from a church (also &quot;St. Joseph&#x27;s&quot; - now no longer there) on Buchanan Street at Moor Road which was associated with the neighbouring Roman Catholic Convent of Ladywood which closed in the 1970s.

== Sporting institutions ==
Rangers F.C. has their professional training facility, The Rangers Training Centre, at Auchenhowie Road in the east of the town. It was officially opened on 4 July 2001 by then-manager Dick Advocaat and then-chairman David Murray, after whom it was originally named as Murray Park. The total cost of the complex was estimated at £14 million. Following improvements completed in 2019, the facility became the regular home venue for competitive matches played by Rangers&#x27; Women&#x27;s team, Reserve team and Under 18&#x27;s team as well as many younger age groups. On 2 August 2019 the new Academy Stand with an all-seated capacity of 250 was officially opened at The Rangers Training Centre before hosting a reserve friendly against Chelsea F.C. finishing in a 1–1 draw.

Milngavie is the base of West of Scotland F.C., a rugby club, which dates from 1865 and is one of the founder members of the SRU. They were one of the first open rugby clubs in Scotland, i.e. not affiliated to any school.

<text>George Barbier (), né Georges Augustin Barbier, (1882–1932) was one of the great French illustrators of the early 20th century.

== Biography ==
Born in Nantes, France on 16 October 1882, Barbier was 29 years old when he mounted his first exhibition in 1911 and was subsequently swept to the forefront of his profession with commissions to design theatre and ballet costumes, to illustrate books, and to produce haute couture fashion illustrations.

For the next 20 years Barbier led a group from the Ecole des Beaux Arts who were nicknamed by &quot;Vogue&quot; &quot;The Knights of the Bracelet&quot;—a tribute to their fashionable and flamboyant mannerisms and style of dress. Included in this élite circle were Bernard Boutet de Monvel and Pierre Brissaud (both of whom were Barbier&#x27;s first cousins), Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape, and Charles Martin.

During his career Barbier also turned his hand to jewellery, glass and wallpaper design, as well as writing essays and many articles for the prestigious &quot;Gazette du Bon Ton&quot;. In the mid-1920s he worked with Erté to design sets and costumes for the Folies Bergère, and in 1929 he wrote the introduction for Erté&#x27;s acclaimed exhibition and achieved mainstream popularity through his regular appearances in &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot; magazine.

Barbier died in 1932 at the very pinnacle of his success. He is buried in Cemetery Miséricorde, Nantes.

<text>Roger Vadim Plemiannikov (; 26 January 1928 – 11 February 2000) was a French screenwriter, film director and producer, as well as an author, artist and occasional actor. His best-known works are visually lavish films with erotic qualities, such as &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956), &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; (1960), &quot;The Game Is Over&quot; (1966), &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), and &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; (1971).

==Early life==
Vadim was born Roger Vadim Plemiannikov (sometimes transliterated Plemiannikoff) in Paris. His father, Igor Nikolaevich Plemiannikov, a White Russian military officer and pianist, had emigrated from the Russian Empire and become a naturalized French citizen. He was a vice consul of France to Egypt, stationed in Alexandria, later posting to Mersin, Turkey as a consul. Vadim&#x27;s mother, Marie-Antoinette (née Ardilouze), was a stage actress. He had one sister, Hélène Plemiannikov (1929–2022). Although Vadim lived as a diplomat&#x27;s child in Northern Africa and the Middle East in his early youth, the death of his father when Vadim was nine years old caused the family to return to France, where his mother found work running a hostel in the French Alps, which functioned as a way-station for Jews and other fugitives fleeing Nazism.

Vadim studied journalism and writing at the University of Paris, without graduating.

==Film career==
At age 19, he became assistant to film director Marc Allégret, whom he met while working at the Theatre Sarah Bernhardt, and for whom he worked on several screenplays. He was an assistant director on Allegret&#x27;s &quot;Blanche Fury&quot; (1948), a commercially unsuccessful melodrama which Allegret made for a British company in English. Vadim was one of several writers on Allegret&#x27;s French-British &quot;The Naked Heart&quot; (1950), aka &quot;Maria Chapdelaine&quot;, starring Michèle Morgan, as well as serving as assistant director. It was shot in French and English versions. &quot;Blackmailed&quot; (1951) was another film Allegret directed in England, starring Mai Zetterling and Dirk Bogarde; Vadim was credited as one of the writers. He was also one of several writers on Allegret&#x27;s, &quot;La demoiselle et son revenant&quot; (1952).

Vadim did the screenplay and commentary for a documentary, &quot;Le gouffre de la Pierre Saint-Marti&quot; (1953), and was assistant director on Allegret&#x27;s &quot;Julietta&quot; (1953), a popular romance with Jean Marais, Dany Robin and Jeanne Moreau. Vadim wrote Allegret&#x27;s &quot;Loves of Three Queens&quot; (1954), with Hedy Lamarr. Vadim had begun a relationship with model-actress Brigitte Bardot. She was given a good role in a drama directed by Allegret, &quot;School for Love&quot; (1953), aka &quot;Futures Vedettes&quot;, starring Jean Marais; Vadim wrote the script with Allegret. The film was a commercial disappointment. However the next collaboration between Allegret, Bardot and Vadim, &quot;Plucking the Daisy&quot; (1956), aka &quot;Mam&#x27;selle Striptease&quot;, was a huge success at the French box office. So too was &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; (1956), with Bardot. This allowed Vadim to get backing for his first movie as director.

Vadim&#x27;s first film as director was based on an original story of his, &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1956). Starring Bardot, Curt Jurgens and Christian Marquand and produced by Raoul Levy it was not only a major success in France, but around the world, and established Bardot as a global icon. Vadim followed it with &quot;No Sun in Venice&quot; (1957) starring Françoise Arnoul and Marquand, produced by Levy, which was considerably less popular than &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;. Levy, Vadim and Bardot were to make &quot;Paris by Night&quot; with Frank Sinatra but Bardot refused to spend months in the US and Sinatra felt likewise about filming in France. Instead Vadim made &quot;The Night Heaven Fell&quot; (1958), starring Bardot and Stephen Boyd. He was one of several writers on Allegret&#x27;s popular comedy, &quot;Be Beautiful But Shut Up&quot; (1958), starring Mylène Demongeot.

Vadims&#x27;s next film was an adaptation of the book &quot;Les liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1959), which he wrote and directed. It starred Moreau, Gérard Philipe (in his final film) and Annette Stroyberg, a Danish model who became Vadim&#x27;s second wife. The film became a huge hit in France. Stroyberg was also in the vampire film &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; (1960). Vadim was reunited with Bardot for &quot;Please, Not Now!&quot; (1961), a popular comedy. He was one of several directors of the anthology film, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1962).

Vadim began a relationship with a young Catherine Deneuve. She starred in a segment of the anthology film &quot;Tales of Paris&quot; (1962), which was written by Vadim and directed by Allegret. She starred in a film Vadim helped write and produce, &quot;And Satan Calls the Turns&quot; (1962), and was also in &quot;Vice and Virtue&quot; (1963), which Vadim directed. Vadim had another success writing and directing for Bardot, &quot;Love on a Pillow&quot; (1962), but found less favour with &quot;Nutty, Naughty Chateau&quot; (1963) starring Monica Vitti.

Vadim tried another adaptation of a classic erotic text, &quot;La Ronde&quot; (1964). He said at the time, &quot;When I make a picture about relations between people, something erotic comes through; I can&#x27;t help it! But sex has been an inspiration, the greatest inspiration, since art exists.&quot; One of the film&#x27;s many stars was rising American actress Jane Fonda who began a romantic relationship with Vadim. Vadim devised a vehicle for Fonda, &quot;The Game Is Over&quot; (1966), based on a book by Émile Zola. Shot in French and English versions, it was very popular in France, though less so in the US.

Dino de Laurentiis wanted Fonda to star in a science fiction sex comedy, &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968) and she agreed provided Vadim would direct. Following this he directed Fonda in a segment of the omnibus horror film &quot;Spirits of the Dead&quot; (1968) along with her brother Peter Fonda. During his marriage to Fonda, Vadim would accompany her back to the US periodically while she made movies there. He directed &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; (1971) for MGM, starring Rock Hudson and Angie Dickinson. It was a commercial disappointment.
Vadim returned to France. He wrote and directed &quot;Hellé&quot; (1972), starring Gwen Welles, which was a flop. He was reunited with Bardot for &quot;Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman&quot; (1973), which was Bardot&#x27;s penultimate movie and a commercial disappointment. Not particularly successful either were &quot;Charlotte&quot; (1974), and &quot;Game of Seduction&quot; (1976) with Sylvia Kristel and Nathalie Delon. He directed a TV movie &quot;Bonheur, impair et passe&quot; (1977), starring Danielle Darrieux.

In the 1980s Vadim based himself in the US. He directed &quot;Night Games&quot; (1980), where he attempted to make a star of Cindy Pickett, with whom he became romantically involved. He directed a caper film in Canada, &quot;The Hot Touch&quot; (1981), starring Marie-France Pisier. Back in France he wrote and directed &quot;Surprise Party&quot; (1983). He directed episodes of &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; (1984) and &quot;Deadly Nightmares&quot; (1986). Vadim attempted to recapture his former success with a new version of &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; (1988), with Rebecca De Mornay. Very different from the original – it only really used the same title – it failed critically and commercially.

His final years were spent working in TV, where he directed &quot;Safari&quot; (1991) and wrote and directed &quot;Amour fou&quot; (1993), starring Marie-Christine Barrault who became his final wife. She was also in &quot;La Nouvelle tribu&quot; (1996) and its sequel &quot;Un coup de baguette magique&quot; (1997), which Vadim wrote and directed.

==Personal life==
===Romances===
Vadim was celebrated for his romances and marriages to young beautiful actresses. In his mid-30s, he lived with the still-teenaged Catherine Deneuve, by whom he had a son, Christian Vadim, prior to his marriage to Fonda. He was also involved with Margaret Markov, Sylvia Kristel and Cindy Pickett. Later, he cohabited with screenwriter Ann Biderman for several years, announcing their engagement in 1984, but the couple never wed.

===Marriages===
* Brigitte Bardot, 20 December 1952  – 6 December 1957 (divorced)
* Annette Stroyberg, 17 June 1958  – 14 March 1961 (divorced); 1 daughter (Nathalie) b. 7 December 1957
* Jane Fonda, 14 August 1965  – 16 January 1973 (divorced); 1 daughter (Vanessa) b. 28 September 1968 
* Catherine Schneider, 13 December 1975  – 10 June 1977 (divorced); 1 son (Vania) b. 6 April 1974
* Marie-Christine Barrault, 21 December 1990  – 11 February 2000 (his death)

He also had two stepsons from his marriage to Schneider (younger sister of novelist Dominique Schneidre and heiress to the Schneider-Creusot steel and armaments firm) as well as adult stepchildren from Barrault&#x27;s first marriage to Daniel Toscan du Plantier, also a friend of Vadim&#x27;s, who called him &quot;a happy man. He was someone in whom there was so much satisfaction to the end of his life. The films merely reflected his happiness.&quot; Nathalie, his eldest daughter, told Fonda biographer Patricia Bosworth: &quot;Jane was the love of my father&#x27;s life.&quot;

==Writing==
In addition to Vadim&#x27;s theatre and film work, he also wrote several books, including the memoirs &quot;Memoires du Diable&quot;, &quot;Le Gout du Bonheur: Souvenirs 1940–1958&quot; and an autobiography, &quot;D&#x27;une étoile à l&#x27;autre&quot; (&quot;From One Star to the Next&quot;) as well as a tell-all about his most famous exes, &quot;Bardot, Deneuve &amp; Fonda: My Life with the Three Most Beautiful Women in the World&quot;, published in 1986. &quot;My attitude is that if this book makes me a little money it will be a tiny compensation for all the money I helped those actresses make&quot;, Vadim explained.
He also wrote several plays and books of fiction, including &quot;L&#x27;ange affamé&quot;.

==Death==
Vadim died of lymphoma at age 72 on 11 February 2000. Widow Barrault and ex-wives Bardot, Fonda, Schneider and Stroyberg were all in attendance at his funeral; ex-girlfriends Biderman and Deneuve were not. He is buried at St. Tropez Cemetery.
