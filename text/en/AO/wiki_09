<text>Leiden University (abbreviated as LEI; ) is a public research university in Leiden, Netherlands. Established in 1575 by William, Prince of Orange as a Protestant institution, it holds the distinction of being the oldest university in the Netherlands of today.

During the Dutch Golden Age scholars from around Europe were attracted to the Dutch Republic for its climate of intellectual tolerance. Individuals such as Ren√© Descartes, Rembrandt, Christiaan Huygens, Hugo Grotius, Benedictus Spinoza, and later Baron d&#x27;Holbach were active in Leiden and environs.

The university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments, housing more than forty national and international research institutes. Its historical primary campus consists of several buildings spread over Leiden, while a second campus located in The Hague houses a liberal arts college (Leiden University College The Hague) and several of its faculties. It is a member of the Coimbra Group, the Europaeum, and a founding member of the League of European Research Universities.

The university has produced twenty-six Spinoza Prize Laureates and sixteen Nobel Laureates. Members of the Dutch royal family such as Queen Juliana, Queen Beatrix, and King Willem-Alexander are alumni, and ten prime ministers of the Netherlands including Mark Rutte. US President John Quincy Adams also studied at the university.

==History==

===Foundation and early history===


In 1575, the emerging Dutch Republic did not have universities in its northern heartland. The only other university in the Habsburg Netherlands was the University of Leuven located in an area under firm Spanish control. Prince William founded Leiden University to give the Northern Netherlands an institution that could educate its citizens in religion and provide the government with educated men in all fields. It is said the choice fell on Leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of Leiden against Spanish attacks in 1574. The name of Philip II of Spain, William&#x27;s adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate as he was still the &quot;de jure&quot; count of Holland. Philip II forbade all his subjects to study in Leiden. 

The new institution was initially located in the Convent of Saint Barbara, then moved to the Faliede Bagijn Church in 1577 (now the location of the university museum) and in 1581 to a former convent of Cistercian nuns, a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed by a fire in 1616.

Leiden University&#x27;s reputation was created in part by the presence of scholars such as Justus Lipsius, Joseph Scaliger, Franciscus Gomarus, Hugo Grotius, Jacobus Arminius, Daniel Heinsius, and Gerhard Johann Vossius within fifty years of its founding. By the 1640s, over five hundred students were enrolled from all across Europe, making it the largest Protestant university. Baruch Spinoza discovered Descartes&#x27;s work partly at Leiden University, which he visited for periods of study multiple times. In the 18th century, Jacobus Gronovius, Herman Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, and David Ruhnken were among the renowned academics of the university.

In 1896, the Zeeman effect was discovered at the institution by Pieter Zeeman and shortly afterward explained by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz. In the world&#x27;s first university low-temperature laboratory, Professor Heike Kamerlingh Onnes achieved a temperature only one degree above absolute zero. In 1908, he was also the first to succeed in liquifying helium and has played a role in the discovery of superconductivity in metals.

===Modern day===
The University Library has more than 5.2 million books and fifty thousand journals. It also has collections of Western and Oriental manuscripts, printed books, archives, prints, drawings, photographs, maps, and atlases. It houses the world&#x27;s largest collections on Indonesia and the Caribbean, collected by the Scaliger Institute which studies various aspects of knowledge transmissions and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day. In 2005, the manuscript of Einstein on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation) was discovered in one of Leiden&#x27;s libraries.

==== Partnerships ====
In 2012 Leiden entered into a strategic alliance with Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Rotterdam for the universities to increase the quality of their research and teaching. The university is also the unofficial home of the Bilderberg Group, a meeting of high-level political and economic figures from North America and Europe. Leiden University partnered with Duke University School of Law starting in 2017 to run a joint summer program on global and transnational law from its Hague campus.

==Location and buildings==
The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city. Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while Van Steenis, Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern.

Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The KITLV or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the Leiden Observatory 1633; the Natural History Museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the &quot;Rijksmuseum van Oudheden&quot; (National Museum of Antiquities), with especially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was Philipp Franz von Siebold&#x27;s Japanese collections. The anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.

The Hortus Botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th-century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese Siebold Memorial Museum symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world-class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.

===Campus The Hague===
In 1998, the university has expanded to The Hague which has become home to Campus The Hague, with six of the seven faculties represented and exclusive home to the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, International Studies and Leiden University College The Hague, a liberal arts and sciences college. Here, the university offers academic courses in the fields of law, political science, public administration and medicine. It occupied a number of buildings in the centre of the city, including a college building at Lange Voorhout, before moving into the new &#x27;Wijnhaven&#x27; building on Turfmarkt in 2016.

The Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs was established in 2011, together with the University College, and one of the largest programmes of the Faculty of Humanities, International Studies.

Since 2017 Leiden University Medical Center also has a branch at Campus The Hague.

==Organisation==

The university is divided into seven major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programmes and over 100 graduate programmes.

* Archaeology
* Governance and Global Affairs
* Humanities
* Law
* Medicine / LUMC
* Science
* Social and Behavioural sciences

==Academic profile==

===Undergraduate studies===
Most of the university&#x27;s departments offer their degree programme(s). Undergraduate programmes lead to either a B.A., B.Sc., or LL.B. degree. Other degrees, such as the B.Eng. or B.F.A., are not awarded at Leiden University.
===Graduate studies===
Students can choose from a range of graduate programmes. Most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. Leiden University offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either MA, MSc, MPhil, or LLM degrees. The MPhil is the most advanced graduate degree and is awarded by select university departments (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archeology, Philosophy, and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career or before going into law or medicine. Traditionally, the MPhil degree enabled its holder to teach at the university levels as an associate professor.

===Doctorate programmes===
In addition, most departments, affiliated (research) institutes, or faculties offer doctorate programmes or positions, leading to the Ph.D. degree. Most of the Ph.D. programmes offered by the university are concentrated in several research schools or institutes.

===Research schools and affiliated institutes===
Leiden University has more than 50 research and graduate schools and institutes. Some of them are fully affiliated with one faculty of the university, while others are interfaculty institutes or interuniversity institutes.

==Rankings and reputation==
===Notable alumni and professors===
Of the 107 Spinoza Prize laureates (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), twenty-six were granted to professors of Leiden University. Literary historian Frits van Oostrom was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award for his work on developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre. Other Spinoza Prize winners are linguists Frederik Kortlandt and Pieter Muysken, mathematician Hendrik Lenstra, physicists Carlo Beenakker, Jan Zaanen, Dirk Bouwmeester and Michel Orrit, astronomers Ewine van Dishoeck, Marijn Franx and Alexander Tielens, transplantation biologist Els Goulmy, clinical epidemiologist Frits Rosendaal, pedagogue Marinus van IJzendoorn, archeologists Wil Roebroeks and Corinne Hofman, neurologist Michel Ferrari, classicist Ineke Sluiter, social psychologist Naomi Ellemers, statistician Aad van der Vaart, cognitive psychologist Eveline Crone, organisation psychologist Carsten de Dreu, chemical immunologist Sjaak Neefjes, parasitologist Maria Yazdanbakhsh, electrochemist Mark Koper and astrophysicist Ignas Snellen.

The Stevin Prize laureates who have achieved exceptional success in knowledge exchange and impact for society include the following Leiden professors: health psychologist Andrea Evers, immunology technologist Ton Schumacher and psychologist Judi Mesman. Among other leading professors are Wim Blockmans, professor of Medieval History, and Willem Adelaar, professor of Amerindian Languages.

Other notable Leiden researchers were the Arabist and Islam expert Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, the law expert Cornelis van Vollenhoven and historian Johan Huizinga, all during the 1920s and 1930s. Martinus Beijerinck, one of the founders of virology, finished his Ph.D. at Leiden in 1877.

===Nobel laureates===
Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. Three other professors received the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman received the Nobel Prize for their pioneering work in the field of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist Willem Einthoven for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of electrocardiography.

Nobel laureates associated with Leiden include the physicists Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Paul Ehrenfest. Other Leiden-affiliated Nobel laureates include Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Tobias Asser, Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, Igor Tamm, Jan Tinbergen, Nikolaas Tinbergen, Tjalling Koopmans, Nicolaas Bloembergen, and Niels Jerne.

<doc id="86376" wikidata="Q5555726" url="?curid=86376" title="Frequency-division multiplexing">
<text>In telecommunications, frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is a technique by which the total bandwidth available in a communication medium is divided into a series of non-overlapping frequency bands, each of which is used to carry a separate signal. This allows a single transmission medium such as a microwave radio link, cable or optical fiber to be shared by multiple independent signals. Another use is to carry separate serial bits or segments of a higher rate signal in parallel.
The most common example of frequency-division multiplexing is radio and television broadcasting, in which multiple radio signals at different frequencies pass through the air at the same time. Another example is cable television, in which many television channels are carried simultaneously on a single cable. FDM is also used by telephone systems to transmit multiple telephone calls through high capacity trunklines, communications satellites to transmit multiple channels of data on uplink and downlink radio beams, and broadband DSL modems to transmit large amounts of computer data through twisted pair telephone lines, among many other uses.

An analogous technique called wavelength division multiplexing is used in fiber-optic communication, in which multiple channels of data are transmitted over a single optical fiber using different wavelengths (frequencies).

== Principle ==

The multiple separate information (modulation) signals that are sent over an FDM system, such as the video signals of the television channels that are sent over a cable TV system, are called baseband signals. At the source end, for each frequency channel, an electronic oscillator generates a &quot;carrier&quot; signal, a steady oscillating waveform at a single frequency that serves to &quot;carry&quot; information. The carrier is much higher in frequency than the baseband signal. The carrier signal and the baseband signal are combined in a modulator circuit. The modulator alters some aspect of the carrier signal, such as its amplitude, frequency, or phase, with the baseband signal, &quot;piggybacking&quot; the data onto the carrier.

The result of modulating (mixing) the carrier with the baseband signal is to generate sub-frequencies near the carrier frequency, at the sum (&quot;f&quot;C + &quot;f&quot;B) and difference (&quot;f&quot;C ‚àí &quot;f&quot;B) of the frequencies. The information from the modulated signal is carried in sidebands on each side of the carrier frequency. Therefore, all the information carried by the channel is in a narrow band of frequencies clustered around the carrier frequency, this is called the passband of the channel.

Similarly, additional baseband signals are used to modulate carriers at other frequencies, creating other channels of information. The carriers are spaced far enough apart in frequency that the band of frequencies occupied by each channel, the passbands of the separate channels, do not overlap. All the channels are sent through the transmission medium, such as a coaxial cable, optical fiber, or through the air using a radio transmitter. As long as the channel frequencies are spaced far enough apart that none of the passbands overlap, the separate channels will not interfere with each other. Thus the available bandwidth is divided into &quot;slots&quot; or channels, each of which can carry a separate modulated signal.

For example, the coaxial cable used by cable television systems has a bandwidth of about 1000 MHz, but the passband of each television channel is only 6¬†MHz wide, so there is room for many channels on the cable (in modern digital cable systems each channel in turn is subdivided into subchannels and can carry up to 10 digital television channels).

At the destination end of the cable or fiber, or the radio receiver, for each channel a local oscillator produces a signal at the carrier frequency of that channel, that is mixed with the incoming modulated signal. The frequencies subtract, producing the baseband signal for that channel again. This is called demodulation. The resulting baseband signal is filtered out of the other frequencies and output to the user.

== Telephone ==
For long distance telephone connections, 20th century telephone companies used L-carrier and similar coaxial cable systems carrying thousands of voice circuits multiplexed in multiple stages by channel banks.

For shorter distances, cheaper balanced pair cables were used for various systems including Bell System K- and N-Carrier. Those cables did not allow such large bandwidths, so only 12 voice channels (double sideband) and later 24 (single sideband) were multiplexed into four wires, one pair for each direction with repeaters every several miles, approximately 10¬†km. See 12-channel carrier system. By the end of the 20th century, FDM voice circuits had become rare. Modern telephone systems employ digital transmission, in which time-division multiplexing (TDM) is used instead of FDM.

Since the late 20th century, digital subscriber lines (DSL) have used a Discrete multitone (DMT) system to divide their spectrum into frequency channels.

=== Group and supergroup ===
A once commonplace FDM system, used for example in L-carrier, uses crystal filters which operate at the 8¬†MHz range to form a Channel Group of 12 channels, 48¬†kHz bandwidth in the range 8140 to 8188¬†kHz by selecting carriers in the range 8140 to 8184¬†kHz selecting upper sideband this group can then be translated to the standard range 60 to 108¬†kHz by a carrier of 8248¬†kHz. Such systems are used in DTL (Direct To Line) and DFSG (Directly formed super group).

132 voice channels (2SG + 1G) can be formed using DTL plane the modulation and frequency plan are given in FIG1 and FIG2 use of DTL technique allows the formation of a maximum of 132 voice channels that can be placed direct to line. DTL eliminates group and super group equipment.

DFSG can take similar steps where a direct formation of a number of super groups can be obtained in the 8¬†kHz the DFSG also eliminates group equipment and can offer:
* Reduction in cost 7% to 13%
* Less equipment to install and maintain
* Increased reliability due to less equipment

Both DTL and DFSG can fit the requirement of low density system (using DTL) and higher density system (using DFSG). The DFSG terminal is similar to DTL terminal except instead of two super groups many super groups are combined. A Mastergroup of 600 channels (10 super-groups) is an example based on DFSG.

== Other examples ==
FDM can also be used to combine signals before final modulation onto a carrier wave. In this case the carrier signals are referred to as subcarriers: an example is stereo FM transmission, where a 38¬†kHz subcarrier is used to separate the left-right difference signal from the central left-right sum channel, prior to the frequency modulation of the composite signal.
An analog NTSC television channel is divided into subcarrier frequencies for video, color, and audio.
DSL uses different frequencies for voice and for upstream and downstream data transmission on the same conductors, which is also an example of frequency duplex.
Where frequency-division multiplexing is used as to allow multiple users to share a physical communications channel, it is called frequency-division multiple access (FDMA).

FDMA is the traditional way of separating radio signals from different
transmitters.
In the 1860s and 70s, several inventors attempted FDM under the names of acoustic telegraphy and harmonic telegraphy. Practical FDM was only achieved in the electronic age. Meanwhile, their efforts led to an elementary understanding of electroacoustic technology, resulting in the invention of the telephone.

<doc id="86378" wikidata="Q211955" url="?curid=86378" title="C√∫ Chulainn">
<text>C√∫ Chulainn ( ), is an Irish warrior hero and demigod in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an incarnation of the Irish god Lugh, who is also his father. His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of King Conchobar mac Nessa.

Born S√©tanta, he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing Culann&#x27;s fierce guard dog in self-defence and offering to take its place until a replacement could be reared, hence he became the &quot;Hound (&quot;c√∫&quot;) of Culann&quot;. He was trained in martial arts by Sc√°thach, who gave him the spear G√°e Bulg. It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but that his life would be short. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single-handedly against the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht in the famous &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; (&quot;Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;). He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy (&quot;r√≠astrad&quot;), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer L√°eg and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.

C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s wife is Emer, although he has many other lovers. With A√≠fe he has a son named Connla, whom C√∫ Chulainn tragically kills. C√∫ Chulainn himself is said to have died in battle, binding himself to a standing stone so he can die on his feet

The image of C√∫ Chulainn is often depicted in piece of art such as a bronze sculpture of the dying C√∫ Chulainn by Oliver Sheppard in the Dublin General Post Office (GPO) in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916 and stained glass panel of it in St. Enda&#x27;s School. In literature, C√∫ Chulainn has been a central figure in many works. Lady Gregory retold many of the legends of C√∫ Chulainn in her 1902 book &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot;, which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content.

==Name==
His birth name &quot;S√©tanta&quot; may be linked to a Celtic tribe, the Setantii, who dwelt on the west coast of Celtic Britain. His later name &quot;C√∫ Chulainn&quot;, is usually translated &quot;Culann&#x27;s hound&quot;, and was explained in the tale whereby he stood in for Culann&#x27;s guard dog. Although &quot;c√∫&quot; literally means &quot;hound&quot;, it was also a common figurative term for a warrior in early Irish literature, thus can also mean &quot;Culann&#x27;s warrior&quot;. Folklorist D√°ith√≠ √ì h√ìg√°in speculated that the second part of the name could come from an old Irish word for a chariot, &quot;cul&quot;, thus meaning &quot;chariot-warrior&quot;.

==Legends==
===Birth===
There are a number of versions of the story of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s miraculous birth. In the earliest version of &quot;Compert C(h)on Culainn&quot; (&quot;The Conception of C√∫ Chulainn&quot;), his mother Deichtine is the daughter and charioteer of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. As snow begins to fall, Ulstermen seek shelter in a nearby house. As the host&#x27;s wife goes into labour, Deichtine assists in the birth of a baby boy, while a mare gives birth to twin colts. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the &quot;Brug na B√≥inde&quot; (the Neolithic mound at Newgrange)‚Äîthe house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and begins raising him as her own, but the boy falls ill and dies. The god Lug appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called S√©tanta. Her pregnancy turns into a scandal as she is betrothed to Sualtam mac R√≥ich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband&#x27;s bed &quot;virgin-whole&quot;. She then conceives a son whom she names S√©tanta.

In the later and better-known version of &quot;Compert Con Culainn&quot;, Deichtine is Conchobar&#x27;s sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, a member of the Tuatha D√© Danann, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named S√©tanta.

The nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; Sencha mac Ailella, who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy Bla√≠ Briugu, who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior Fergus mac R√≥ich, who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet Amergin, who will educate him, and his wife Findch√≥em, who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findch√≥em on Muirthemne Plain in modern County Louth (at the time part of Ulster), alongside their son Conall Cernach.

In another version, the child is named S√©dana, and the name is given to him by Ceat mac M√°gach. Ceat takes S√©dana into fosterage and gives him to his own foster parents, Sr√≠an and Gabur, to nurse; they are the parents of L√°eg, C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s charioteer, and so the pair grow up together from infancy.

The County Louth town of Dundalk has the motto &quot;M√© do rug C√∫ Chulainn cr√≥ga&quot; &quot;I gave birth to brave C√∫ Chulainn&quot;. While the County of Louth and the village of Louth in turn named after C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s father the God Lugh.

===Childhood===
The stories of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s childhood are told in a flashback sequence in &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;. As a small child, living in his parents&#x27; house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs to be allowed to join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys&#x27; protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a &quot;r√≠astrad&quot; (transformative battle frenzy) and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has S√©tanta put himself under the boys&#x27; protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.

Culann the smith invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar goes to the playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so impressed by S√©tanta&#x27;s performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. S√©tanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But when Culann asks if anyone will be arriving late to the feast, Conchobar forgets about S√©tanta, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When S√©tanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so S√©tanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann&#x27;s house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be &quot;C√∫ Chulainn&quot;‚Äî&quot;Culann&#x27;s Hound&quot;.

One day at Emain Macha, C√∫ Chulainn overhears Cathbad teaching his pupils. One asks him what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. C√∫ Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar and asks for arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy‚Äîthe warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, in response to a similar prophecy by Cathbad, C√∫ Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king&#x27;s own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Sc√©ne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar&#x27;s wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.

===Emer and C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s training===
In C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s youth he is so beautiful the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that C√∫ Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Sc√°thach in the land of Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. C√∫ Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence &quot;D√∫n Sc√°ith&quot; (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac N√≥is, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves C√∫ Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand, especially cause C√∫ Chulainn his foster brother.

Sc√°thach teaches C√∫ Chulainn all the arts of war, including the use of the G√°e Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s best friend and foster brother. The two foster brothers share a very close relationship, sharing a bed at times and speaking often and at great length of their love for one another; this has at times led to speculation that the two men were lovers (though this theory is controversial). During his time there, Sc√°thach faces a battle against A√≠fe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Sc√°thach, knowing A√≠fe&#x27;s prowess, fears for C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights A√≠fe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but C√∫ Chulainn distracts her by calling out that A√≠fe&#x27;s horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Sc√°thach, and bear him a son.

Leaving A√≠fe pregnant, C√∫ Chulainn returns from Scotland fully trained, but Forgall still refuses to let him marry Emer. C√∫ Chulainn storms Forgall&#x27;s fortress, killing twenty-four of Forgall&#x27;s men, abducts Emer and steals Forgall&#x27;s treasure. Forgall himself falls from the ramparts to his death. Conchobar has the &quot;right of the first night&quot; over all marriages of his subjects. He is afraid of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s reaction if he exercises it in this case, but is equally afraid of losing his authority if he does not. Cathbad suggests a solution: Conchobar sleeps with Emer on the night of the wedding, but Cathbad sleeps between them.

===Killing his son===
Eight years later, Connla, C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s son by A√≠fe, comes to Ireland in search of his father, but C√∫ Chulainn takes him as an intruder and kills him when he refuses to identify himself. Connla does not identify himself, as his mother A√≠fe bound him to not identify himself or back down from a challenge. She does this as she wishes revenge upon C√∫ Chulainn for loving another woman after her. Connla was also trained and almost beat his father in battle, but misses his spear shot on purpose as he finds out C√∫ Chulainn is his father. However C√∫ Chulainn hits Connla with his spear, the Gae Bulg, which mortally wounds him. Connla&#x27;s last words to his father as he dies are that they would have &quot;carried the flag of Ulster to the gates of Rome and beyond&quot;, leaving C√∫ Chulainn grief-stricken. The story of C√∫ Chulainn and Connla shows a striking similarity to the legend of Persian hero Rostam who also kills his son Sohrab. Rostam and C√∫ Chulainn share several other characteristics, including killing a ferocious beast at a very young age, their near invincibility in battle, and the manner of their deaths. Another similar myth is found in the Hildebrandslied, in which Hildebrand is thought to kill his son, Hadubrand, though the poem&#x27;s ending is lost.

===Lugaid and Derbforgaill===
During his time abroad, C√∫ Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She falls in love with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him in the form of a pair of swans. C√∫ Chulainn, not realising who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the &quot;Lia F√°il&quot; (stone of destiny) fails to cry out when he stands on it, so C√∫ Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and C√∫ Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.

===The Cattle Raid of Cooley===

At the age of seventeen, C√∫ Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster from the army of Connacht in the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;. Queen Medb of Connacht mounted the invasion to steal the stud bull Donn C√∫ailnge, C√∫ Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when he should have been watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labour pains, so it becomes C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s job to stop Medb&#x27;s army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a standoff that lasts for months.

Before one combat a beautiful young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the Morr√≠gan, and in revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms while he is engaged in combat against L√≥ch mac Mofemis. As an eel, she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a sling stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer at the head of the stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone. After C√∫ Chulainn finally defeats L√≥ch, the Morr√≠gan appears to him as an old woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.

After one particularly arduous combat, C√∫ Chulainn lies severely wounded but is visited by Lug, who tells him he is his father and heals his wounds. When C√∫ Chulainn wakes up and sees that the boy-troop of Emain Macha have attacked the Connacht army and been slaughtered, he has his most spectacular &quot;r√≠astrad&quot; yet:

He attacks the army and kills hundreds, building walls of corpses.
When his foster father Fergus mac R√≥ich, now in exile in Medb&#x27;s court, is sent to face him, C√∫ Chulainn agrees to yield, so long as Fergus agrees to return the favour the next time they meet. Finally, he fights a gruelling three-day duel with his best friend and foster brother, Ferdiad, at a ford that was named &quot;√Åth Fhir Diadh&quot; (Ardee, County Louth) after him.

The Ulstermen eventually rouse, one by one at first, and finally &quot;en masse&quot;. The final battle begins. C√∫ Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps his side of the bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht&#x27;s other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, C√∫ Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.

===Bricriu&#x27;s Feast===
The troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, C√∫ Chulainn, Conall Cernach and L√≥egaire B√∫adach, to compete for the champion&#x27;s portion at his feast. In every test that is set, C√∫ Chulainn comes out on top, but neither Conall nor L√≥egaire will accept the result. C√∫ Ro√≠ mac D√°ire of Munster settles it by visiting each in the guise of a hideous churl and challenging them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and L√≥egaire both behead C√∫ Ro√≠, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only C√∫ Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to C√∫ Ro√≠&#x27;s axe; C√∫ Ro√≠ spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Other examples include the 13th century French &quot;Life of Caradoc&quot; and the English romances &quot;The Turke and Gowin&quot;, and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;.

===The Death of C√∫ Ro√≠===
C√∫ Ro√≠, again in disguise, joins the Ulstermen on a raid on Inis Fer Falga (probably the Isle of Man), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct Blathn√°t, daughter of the island&#x27;s king, who loves C√∫ Chulainn. But when C√∫ Ro√≠ is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathn√°t. C√∫ Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but C√∫ Ro√≠ cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathn√°t with him. Like other heroes such as the Biblical Samson, Duryodhana in the Mahabharata and the Welsh Llew Llaw Gyffes, C√∫ Ro√≠ can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in different versions of the story. Blathn√°t discovers how to kill him and betrays him to C√∫ Chulainn, who does the deed. However, Ferchertne, C√∫ Ro√≠&#x27;s poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabs Blathn√°t and leaps off a cliff, killing her and himself.

===Emer&#x27;s only jealousy===

C√∫ Chulainn has many lovers, but Emer&#x27;s only jealousy comes when he falls in love with Fand, wife of Manann√°n mac Lir. Manann√°n has left her and she has been attacked by three Fomorians who want to control the Irish Sea. C√∫ Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manann√°n knows their relationship is doomed because C√∫ Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand&#x27;s love for C√∫ Chulainn she decides to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer&#x27;s magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manann√°n shakes his cloak between C√∫ Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and C√∫ Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.

===Death===
(Irish: &quot;Aided Con Culainn&quot;, also known as &quot;Brislech M√≥r Maige Muirthemne&quot;). Medb conspires with Lugaid, son of C√∫ Ro√≠, Erc, son of Cairbre Nia Fer, and the sons of others C√∫ Chulainn had killed, to draw him out to his death. His fate is sealed by his breaking of the &quot;geasa&quot; (taboos) upon him. C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s &quot;geasa&quot; included a ban against eating dog meat, but in early Ireland there was a powerful general taboo against refusing hospitality, so when an old crone offers him a meal of dog meat, he has no choice but to break his &quot;geis&quot;. In this way he is spiritually weakened for the fight ahead of him. Lugaid has three magical spears made, and it is prophesied that a king will fall by each of them. With the first he kills C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s charioteer L√°eg, king of chariot drivers. With the second he kills C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s horse, Liath Macha, king of horses. With the third he hits C√∫ Chulainn, mortally wounding him. C√∫ Chulainn ties himself to a standing stone to die on his feet, facing his enemies. This stone is traditionally identified as Clochafarmore, located near Dundalk. Due to his ferocity even when so near death, it is only when a raven lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead. Lugaid approaches and cuts off his head, but as he does so the &quot;hero-light&quot; burns around C√∫ Chulainn and his sword falls from his hand and cuts Lugaid&#x27;s hand off. The light disappears only after his right hand, his sword arm, is cut from his body. According to the Annals, C√∫ Chulainn died in the year AD 1.

Conall Cernach had sworn that if C√∫ Chulainn died before him he would avenge him before sunset, and when he hears C√∫ Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes a bite out of Lugaid&#x27;s side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc&#x27;s sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.

===Appearance===
C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s appearance is occasionally remarked on in the texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless. He is often described as dark: in &quot;The Wooing of Emer&quot; and &quot;Bricriu&#x27;s Feast&quot; he is &quot;a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men of Erin&quot;, in &quot;The Intoxication of the Ulstermen&quot; he is a &quot;little, black-browed man&quot;, and in &quot;The Phantom Chariot of C√∫ Chulainn&quot; &quot;[h]is hair was thick and black, and smooth as though a cow had licked it... in his head his eyes gleamed swift and grey&quot;; yet the prophetess Fedelm in the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; describes him as blond. The description of his appearance comes later in the &quot;T√°in&quot;:

==Later stories==
===Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind===
The &quot;Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind&quot; (or &quot;Demonic Chariot of Cu Chulaind&quot;) tells the story of when Saint Patrick was trying to convert King L√≥egaire to Christianity.

In the tale St. Patrick visited King Loegaire, attempting to convert him to the Christian faith. The king agreed but on a condition: that the saint call up Cu Chulainn from the dead, bringing him to the king&#x27;s presence. St. Patrick agreed, and then the hero appeared, complete with the chariot, and his two horses Liath Macha and Dub-Sainglend, together with his charioteer Loeg. The saint asks if the king is convinced ‚Äì he replies that the appearance was so short he was not yet sure. The saint responds that God is so powerful that the king would see the hero again.

The ghostly hero returns, and this time salutes and addresses the saint, he then turns to the king, confirms it is Cu Chulainn he sees and not some demon, and implores him to believe in the saint and his god. A dialogue between king and ghostly hero takes place, in which the old hero recounts his life, including a poetic telling of his heroic deeds, ending with a request to Patrick to allow him too into heaven ‚Äì the king is convinced. At the end of this, the saint declares that Cu Chulainn is welcome in heaven.

The date of the tale is possibly around late tenth century or perhaps to the early eleventh century.

===A Legend of Knockmany===
C√∫ Chulainn was later reimagined as an evil giant at odds with Fionn mac Cumhaill (or Finn McCool).

Unrecorded before the 19th century, the earliest known version was &quot;A Legend of Knockmany&quot; in the 1845 &quot;Tales and Sketches ... of the Irish Peasantry&quot; by William Carleton. Variants were published in Patrick Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts&quot; (1866), and republished and brought to a larger audience by W. B. Yeats in &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot; (1888), followed by numerous adaptations and variants, many uncredited. The work was included in later collections of &#x27;folk tales&#x27; by other editors such as Joseph Jacobs in his &quot;Celtic Fairy Tales&quot; (1890).

In this tale, C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s power was contained in his middle finger. Wishing to defeat Finn, he came to Finn&#x27;s house, but Finn disguised himself as a baby while his wife Oona baked cakes, some with griddle irons inside, some without. When C√∫ Chulainn could not bite through his cake (which had an iron in it) but the baby could (Finn&#x27;s cake had no iron), in amazement C√∫ Chulainn felt to see how sharp the baby&#x27;s teeth were, allowing Finn to bite his middle finger off and deprive C√∫ Chulainn of both his strength and size.

==Indo-European parallels==
C√∫ Chulainn shows striking similarities to the legendary Persian hero Rostam, as well as to the Germanic Lay of Hildebrand and the labours of the Greek epic hero Heracles, suggesting a common Indo-European origin, but lacking in linguistic, anthropological and archaeological material. C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s smiting of the hound with a hurling stick is reminiscent of the tenth labour of Heracles, in which Heracles is charged with stealing the cattle of Geryon and is attacked by a two-headed hound, which he dispatches with a club.

Additional Indo-European typological parallels include Lithuanian Velnias, who like C√∫ Chulainn is the protector of cattle, and Romulus, who is associated with a canine in his youth and is surrounded by a youthful band of warriors (the &quot;maccrad&quot; in the case of C√∫ Chulainn).

==Cultural depictions==

===Images===
The image of C√∫ Chulainn is often invoked by Irish nationalists. The Gaelic revival fed into the Irish revolutionary period, with elements of Irish mythology adopted in nationalist symbolism. In St. Enda&#x27;s School, run by revolutionary Patrick Pearse, there was a stained-glass panel of C√∫ Chulainn. A bronze sculpture of the dying C√∫ Chulainn by Oliver Sheppard stands in the Dublin General Post Office (GPO) in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916. √âamon de Valera unveiled the statue in 1935 as President of the Executive Council (Prime Minister) and described Sheppard&#x27;s work as &quot;symbolising the dauntless courage and abiding constancy of our people&quot;. The statue&#x27;s image is reproduced on the obverse of 1916 Medal awarded to republican veterans of the rising, the Military Star of the Irish Defence Forces, and the commemorative ten shilling coin issued in 1966 for the rising&#x27;s 50th anniversary. He is also depicted in several murals in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. An example is the mural painted in 1996 on Lenadoon Avenue, Belfast commemorating Provisional IRA members from the area, which shows C√∫ Chulainn in the centre.

More recently, some Ulster loyalists have also invoked the image of C√∫ Chulainn, depicting him as an ancient &quot;defender of Ulster&quot; from Irish enemies to the south. This is based on Ian Adamson&#x27;s widely rejected theory that C√∫ Chulainn was a Cruthin hero and that they were a non-Celtic people who were at war with the Gaels. He is depicted in a loyalist mural on Highfield Drive, and was formerly depicted in another on the Newtownards Road, Belfast.

A statue of C√∫ Chulainn carrying the body of Fer Diad stands in Ardee, County Louth, traditionally the site of their combat in the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;. A sculpture by Martin Heron, entitled &quot;For the Love of Emer&quot;, depicting C√∫ Chulainn balancing on a tilting 20-foot pole, representing the feat of balancing on the butt of a spear he learned from Sc√°thach, was installed in Armagh in 2010.

===Literature===
Augusta, Lady Gregory retold many of the legends of C√∫ Chulainn in her 1902 book &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot;, which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. It was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend William Butler Yeats, who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot; (1904), &quot;The Green Helmet&quot; (1910), &quot;At the Hawk&#x27;s Well&quot; (1917), &quot;The Only Jealousy of Emer&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Death of Cuchulain&quot; (1939), and the poems &quot;Cuchulain&#x27;s Fight with the Sea&quot; (1892) and &quot;Cuchulain Comforted&quot; (1939), the latter completed two weeks before his death. An tAthair Peadar Ua Laoghaire, a priest from Castlelyons in County Cork, serialised the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; on a weekly basis in &quot;The Cork Examiner&quot; between 1900 and 1901 as part of the Gaelic revival. P√°draig Pearse, another revivalist age writer and member of Conradh na Gaeilge mentions C√∫ Chulainn in his 1912 his Irish language poem &quot;Mise √âire&quot; where Pearse personifies Ireland as a mother figure who gave birth to C√∫ Chulainn, but whose glory days are behind her. Sheppard&#x27;s statue of C√∫ Chulainn is depicted in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Murphy&quot; as a vice to mock the Irish Free State and the attitude of its inhabitants. The story of C√∫ Chulainn and many other characters from Irish B√©aloideas tales such as Fionn mac Cumhaill are still taught as part of the Irish primary school curriculum in both the Republic and Northern Ireland.

<text>Vespertilionidae is a family of microbats, of the order Chiroptera, flying, insect-eating mammals variously described as the common, vesper, or simple nosed bats. The vespertilionid family is the most diverse and widely distributed of bat families, specialised in many forms to occupy a range of habitats and ecological circumstances, and it is frequently observed or the subject of research. The facial features of the species are often simple, as they mainly rely on vocally emitted echolocation. The tails of the species are enclosed by the lower flight membranes between the legs. Over 300 species are distributed all over the world, on every continent except Antarctica. It owes its name to the genus &quot;Vespertilio&quot;, which takes its name from a word for bat, &#x27;, derived from the [[Latin]] term&#x27; meaning &#x27;evening&#x27;; they are termed &quot;evening bats&quot; and were once referred to as &quot;evening birds&quot;. (The term &quot;evening bat&quot; also often refers more specifically to one of the species, &quot;Nycticeius humeralis&quot;.)

==Evolution==
They are allied to the suborder Microchiroptera, the families of microbats separated from the flying foxes and fruit bats of the megabat group Megachiroptera. The treatments of bat taxonomy have also included a placement amongst the Vespertilioniformes, or Yangochiroptera, as suborder Vespertilionoidea.

Molecular data indicate the Vespertilionidae diverged from the Molossidae in the early Eocene period. The family is thought to have originated somewhere in Laurasia, possibly North America. A recently extinct species, &quot;Synemporion keana&quot;, is known from the Holocene of Hawaii.

==Characteristics==
All species are carnivorous and most are insectivores, exceptions are bats of genera &quot;Myotis&quot; and &quot;Pizonyx&quot; that catch fish and the larger &quot;Nyctalus&quot; species known to capture small passerine birds in flight. The dentition of the family varies between species; the dental formula of the family is: 

They rely mainly on echolocation to navigate and obtain food, but they lack the elaborate nose appendages of microbats that focus nasal emitted ultrasound. The ultrasound signal is usually produced orally, and many species have large external ears to capture and reflect sound, enabling them to discriminate and extract information.

The vespertilionids employ a range of flight techniques. The wing surface is extended to the lower limbs, and the tails of this family are enclosed in an interfemoral membrane. Some are relatively slow-flying genera, such as &quot;Pipistrellus&quot;, that manipulate the configuration of their broader wing shape and may give a fluttery appearance as they forage and glean. Others are specialised as long-winged genera, such as &quot;Lasiurus&quot; and &quot;Nyctalus&quot;, that use rapid pursuit to capture insects. The size range of the family is in head and body length; this excludes the tail, which is itself quite long in many species. They are generally brown or grey in colour, often an indiscriminate appearance as a &#x27;little brown bat&#x27;, although some species have fur that is brightly colored, with reds, oranges, and yellows all being known. The patterns of the superficial appearance include white patches or stripes that may distinguish some species.

Most species roost in caves, although some make use of hollow trees, rocky crevices, animal burrows, or other forms of shelter. Colony sizes also vary greatly, with some roosting alone, and others in groups up to a million individuals. Species native to temperate latitudes typically hibernate to avoid cooler weather, while a few of the tropical species employ aestivation as a method of evading extremes of climate.

==Systematics==
The four subfamilies of Vespertilionidae separate the presumably related taxa, tribes, and genera of extant and extinct taxa.
The subfamilial treatments, based on morphological, geographical, and ecological comparisons have been recombined since the inclusion of the phylogenetic implications of molecular genetics; only the Murininae and Kerivoulinae have not been changed in light of genetic analysis.
Subfamilies that were once recognized as valid, such as the Nyctophilinae, are considered dubious, as molecular evidence suggests they are paraphyletic in their arrangements.
Within the concept Yangochiroptera, an acknowledged cladistic treatment, the closest relatives to the family are the free-tailed bats of family Molossidae.

The monotypic genus &quot;Tomopeas&quot;, represented by the blunt-eared bat (&quot;Tomopeas ravum&quot;), is acknowledged as the potentially closest link between the Vespertilionidae and Molossidae, as it is the most basal member of the Molossidae and has intermediate characteristics of both families.

==Classification==

The grouping of these subfamilies is the classification published by the American Society of Mammalogists. Other authorities raise three subfamilies more: Antrozoinae (which is here the separate family of pallid bats), Tomopeatinae (now regarded as a subfamily of the free-tailed bats), and Nyctophilinae (here included in Vespertilioninae).

Four subfamilies are recognized by &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (2005), the highly diverse Vespertilioninae are also separated as tribes. Newer or resurrected genera are noted. The genus &quot;Cistugo&quot; is no longer included following its move to the separate family Cistugidae. Miniopterinae is additionally no longer recognized as a subfamily, as it was elevated to family status.

A 2021 study attempted to resolve the systematic relationships among the pipistrelle-like bats of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, with systematic inferences based on genetic and morphological analyses of more than 400 individuals across all named genera and the majority of described African pipistrelle-like bat species, with a focus on previously unstudied samples of East African bats. The study proposed a revision of the pipistrelle-like bats in East Africa and described multiple new genera and species.

<text>In telecommunications and computer networks, a channel access method or multiple access method allows more than two terminals connected to the same transmission medium to transmit over it and to share its capacity. Examples of shared physical media are wireless networks, bus networks, ring networks and point-to-point links operating in half-duplex mode.

A channel access method is based on multiplexing, which allows several data streams or signals to share the same communication channel or transmission medium. In this context, multiplexing is provided by the physical layer.

A channel access method may also be a part of the multiple access protocol and control mechanism, also known as medium access control (MAC). Medium access control deals with issues such as addressing, assigning multiplex channels to different users and avoiding collisions. Media access control is a sub-layer in the data link layer of the OSI model and a component of the link layer of the TCP/IP model.

==Fundamental schemes==
Several ways of categorizing multiple-access schemes and protocols have been used in the literature. For example, Daniel Minoli (2009) identifies five principal types of multiple-access schemes: FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, SDMA, and random access. R. Rom and M. Sidi (1990) categorize the protocols into &quot;Conflict-free access protocols&quot;, &quot;Aloha protocols&quot;, and &quot;Carrier Sensing protocols&quot;.

The Telecommunications Handbook (Terplan and Morreale, 2000) identifies the following MAC categories:

* Fixed assigned: TDMA, FDMA+WDMA, CDMA, SDMA
* Demand assigned (DA)
** Reservation: DA/TDMA, DA/FDMA+DA/WDMA, DA/CDMA, DA/SDMA
** Polling: Generalized polling, Distributed polling, Token Passing, Implicit polling, Slotted access
* Random access (RA): Pure RA (ALOHA, GRA), Adaptive RA (TRA), CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

Channel access schemes generally fall into the following categories.

===Frequency-division multiple access===
The frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) channel-access scheme is the most standard analog system, based on the frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme, which provides different frequency bands to different data streams. In the FDMA case, the frequency bands are allocated to different nodes or devices. An example of FDMA systems were the first-generation 1G cell-phone systems, where each phone call was assigned to a specific uplink frequency channel, and another downlink frequency channel. Each message signal (each phone call) is modulated on a specific carrier frequency.

A related technique is wavelength division multiple access (WDMA), based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), where different data streams get different colors in fiber-optical communications. In the WDMA case, different network nodes in a bus or hub network get a different color.

An advanced form of FDMA is the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme, for example, used in 4G cellular communication systems. In OFDMA, each node may use several sub-carriers, making it possible to provide different quality of service (different data rates) to different users. The assignment of sub-carriers to users may be changed dynamically, based on the current radio channel conditions and traffic load. Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), a.k.a. linearly-precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA), is based on single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE).

===Time-division multiple access===
The time-division multiple access (TDMA) channel access scheme is based on the time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme. TDMA provides different time slots to different transmitters in a cyclically repetitive frame structure. For example, node 1 may use time slot 1, node 2 time slot 2, etc. until the last transmitter when it starts over. An advanced form is dynamic TDMA (DTDMA), where an assignment of transmitters to time slots varies on each frame.

Multi-frequency time-division multiple access (MF-TDMA) combines time and frequency multiple access. As an example, 2G cellular systems are based on a combination of TDMA and FDMA. Each frequency channel is divided into eight time slots, of which seven are used for seven phone calls, and one for signaling data.

Statistical time-division multiplexing multiple access is typically also based on time-domain multiplexing, but not in a cyclically repetitive frame structure. Due to its random character, it can be categorized as statistical multiplexing methods and capable of dynamic bandwidth allocation. This requires a media access control (MAC) protocol, i.e. a principle for the nodes to take turns on the channel and to avoid collisions. Common examples are CSMA/CD, used in Ethernet bus networks and hub networks, and CSMA/CA, used in wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11.

===Code-division multiple access and spread spectrum multiple access===
The code-division multiple access (CDMA) scheme is based on spread spectrum, meaning that a wider radio channel bandwidth is used than the data rate of individual bit streams requires, and several message signals are transferred simultaneously over the same carrier frequency, utilizing different spreading codes. Per the Shannon‚ÄìHartley theorem, the wide bandwidth makes it possible to send with a signal-to-noise ratio of much less than 1 (less than 0¬†dB), meaning that the transmission power can be reduced to a level below the level of the noise and co-channel interference from other message signals sharing the same frequency range.

One form is direct-sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA), based on direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), used for example in 3G cell phone systems. Each information bit (or each symbol) is represented by a long code sequence of several pulses, called chips. The sequence is the spreading code, and each message signal (for example each phone call) uses a different spreading code.

Another form is frequency-hopping CDMA (FH-CDMA), based on frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), where the channel frequency is changed rapidly according to a sequence that constitutes the spreading code. As an example, the Bluetooth communication system is based on a combination of frequency-hopping and either CSMA/CA statistical time-division multiplexing communication (for data communication applications) or TDMA (for audio transmission). All nodes belonging to the same user (to the same piconet) use the same frequency hopping sequence synchronously, meaning that they send on the same frequency channel, but CDMA/CA or TDMA is used to avoid collisions within the virtual personal area network (VPAN). Frequency-hopping is used by Bluetooth to reduce the cross-talk and collision probability between nodes in different VPANs.

Other techniques include OFDMA and multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA).

===Space-division multiple access===
Space-division multiple access (SDMA) transmits different information in different physical areas. Examples include simple cellular radio systems and more advanced cellular systems that use directional antennas and power modulation to refine spatial transmission patterns.

===Power-division multiple access===
Power-division multiple access (PDMA) scheme is based on using variable transmission power between users in order to share the available power on the channel. Examples include multiple SCPC modems on a satellite transponder, where users get on demand a larger share of the power budget to transmit at higher data rates.

===Packet mode methods===
Packet mode channel access methods select a single network transmitter for the duration of a packet transmission. Some methods are more suited to wired communication while others are more suited to wireless.

Common statistical time-division multiplexing multiple access protocols for wired multi-drop networks include:

* Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD), used in Ethernet and IEEE 802.3
* Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA)
* Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance for Wireless (MACAW)
* Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA)
* Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance and resolution using priorities (CSMA/CARP)
* Bitwise Arbitration based on constructive interference as used on CAN bus
* Token bus (IEEE 802.4)
* Token Ring (IEEE 802.5)
* Token passing, used in FDDI
* Dynamic time-division multiple access (Dynamic TDMA)

Common multiple access protocols that may be used in packet radio wireless networks include:
* Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), used in IEEE 802.11/WiFi, potentially using a distributed coordination function
* ALOHA and slotted ALOHA, used in ALOHAnet
* Reservation ALOHA (R-ALOHA)
* Mobile Slotted Aloha (MS-ALOHA)
* Code-division multiple access (CDMA)
* Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
* Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)

===Duplexing methods===
Where these methods are used for dividing forward and reverse communication channels, they are known as duplexing methods. A duplexing communication system can be either half-duplex or full duplex. In a half-duplex system, communication only works in one direction at a time. A walkie-talkie is an example of a half-duplex system because both users can communicate with one another, but not at the same time, someone has to finish transmitting before the next person can begin. In a full-duplex system, both users can communicate at the same time. A telephone is the most common example of a full-duplex system because both users can speak and be heard at the same time on each end. Some types of full-duplexing methods are:

* Time-division duplex (TDD)
* Frequency-division duplex (FDD)
* Echo cancellation

==Hybrid application examples==
Note that hybrids of these techniques are frequently used. Some examples:
* The GSM cellular system combines the use of frequency-division duplex (FDD) to prevent interference between outward and return signals, with FDMA and TDMA to allow multiple handsets to work in a single cell.
* GSM with the GPRS packet-switched service combines FDD and FDMA with slotted Aloha for reservation inquiries and a dynamic TDMA scheme for transferring the actual data.
* Bluetooth packet mode communication combines frequency hopping for shared channel access among several private area networks in the same room with CSMA/CA for shared channel access within a network.
* IEEE 802.11b wireless local area networks (WLANs) are based on FDMA and DS-CDMA for avoiding interference among adjacent WLAN cells or access points. This is combined with CSMA/CA for multiple access within the cell.
* HIPERLAN/2 wireless networks combine FDMA with dynamic TDMA, meaning that resource reservation is achieved by packet scheduling.
* G.hn, an ITU-T standard for high-speed networking over home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables) employs a combination of TDMA, token passing and CSMA/CARP to allow multiple devices to share the medium.

==Application-specific definitions==
Different channel access constraints and schemes apply to different applications.

===Local and metropolitan area networks===
In local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs), multiple access methods enable bus networks, ring networks, star networks, wireless networks and half-duplex point-to-point communication, but are not required in full-duplex point-to-point serial lines between network switches and routers. The most common multiple access method is CSMA/CD, which is used in Ethernet. Although today&#x27;s Ethernet installations use full-duplex connections directly to switches. CSMA/CD is still implemented to achieve compatibility with older repeater hubs.

===Satellite communications===
In satellite communications, multiple access is the capability of a communications satellite to function as a portion of a communications link between more than one pair of ground-based terminals concurrently. Three types of multiple access presently used with communications satellites are code-division, frequency-division, and time-division multiple access.

=== Cellular networks ===
In cellular networks the two most widely adopted technologies are CDMA and TDMA. TDMA technology works by identifying natural breaks in speech and utilizing one radio wave to support multiple transmissions in turn. In CDMA technology, each individual packet receives a unique code that is broken up over a wide frequency spectrum and is then reassembled on the other end. CDMA allows multiple people to speak at the same time over the same frequency, allowing more conversations to be transmitted over the same amount of spectrum; this is one reason why CDMA eventually became the most widely adopted channel access method in the wireless industry.

The origins of CDMA can be traced back to the 1940s where it was patented by the United States government and used throughout World War II to transmit messages. However, following the war the patent expired and the use of CDMA diminished and was widely replaced by TDMA. That was until Irwin M. Jacobs an MIT engineer, and fellow employees from the company Linkabit founded the telecommunications company Qualcomm. At the time Qualcomm was founded, Jacobs had already been working on addressing telecommunications problems for the military using digital technology to increase the capacity of spectrum. Qualcomm knew that CDMA would greatly increase the efficiency and availability of wireless, but the wireless industry having already invested millions of dollars into TDMA was skeptical. Jacobs and Qualcomm spent several years improving infrastructure and performing tests and demonstrations of CDMA. In 1993, CDMA became accepted as the wireless industry standard. By 1995, CDMA was being used commercially in the wireless industry as the foundation of 2G.

<text>Paul Garnet Henderson (born January 28, 1943) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. A left winger, Henderson played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs and Atlanta Flames and five in the World Hockey Association (WHA) for the Toronto Toros and Birmingham Bulls. He played over 1,000 games between the two major leagues, scoring 376 goals and 758 points. Henderson played in two NHL All-Star Games and was a member of the 1962 Memorial Cup-winning Hamilton Red Wings team as a junior.

Henderson is best known for playing for Team Canada in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. Played during the Cold War, the series was viewed as a battle for both hockey and cultural supremacy. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in the sixth, seventh and eighth games, the last of which has become legendary in Canada and made him a national hero: it was voted the &quot;sports moment of the century&quot; by The Canadian Press and earned him numerous accolades. Henderson has twice been inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame: in 1995 individually and in 2005 along with all players of the Summit Series team. He was inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 2013.

A born-again Christian, Henderson became a minister, motivational speaker and author following his playing career. He has co-written three books related to hockey or his life. Henderson was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 2013 and of the Order of Ontario in 2014.

==Early life==
Henderson was born January 28, 1943, near Kincardine, Ontario. His mother, Evelyn, went into labour while staying at his father&#x27;s parents&#x27; farm in the nearby community of Amberley during a snowstorm. She gave birth to Paul while the family was crossing Lake Huron via horse-drawn sleigh attempting to reach the hospital in Kincardine. His father, Garnet, was fighting for Canada during the Second World War at the time and did not meet his son until Paul was nearly three years old. Garnet worked for the Canadian National Railway following his return and the family ‚Äì Paul was the eldest to brother Bruce and sisters Marilyn, Coralyn and Sandra ‚Äì moved frequently to different posts in Ontario before settling in Lucknow.

The family often struggled financially, though Garnet was always able to provide the basic life necessities. Paul&#x27;s first experiences with hockey came at a young age in the basement of a local restaurant serving western fare operated by Charlie Chin, an immigrant from China who settled in Lucknow. Henderson played with Chin&#x27;s youngest sons using a ball instead of a puck. The Chin family gave Henderson his first set of hockey equipment; he had been using old catalogues as shin pads. His father coached his youth teams, and at one minor hockey tournament, told his teammates simply to &quot;just give the puck to Paul and get out of his way&quot;. That incident remained with Henderson throughout his life: while it embarrassed him at the time to be singled out in front of his friends and teammates, he later realized it stood as an affirmation and expression of his father&#x27;s pride in him and his abilities.

It was in Lucknow where Henderson met his future wife, Eleanor, at the age of 15 while he was working at a grocery store. They married in 1962 and, wanting to ensure he could provide for his wife, he considered giving up the game to become a history and physical education teacher. His father convinced him to remain in hockey, warning him that he would regret it for the rest of his life if he never tried to make the National Hockey League (NHL). After considering his father&#x27;s advice and talking with Eleanor, Henderson decided to play two additional years, and if he had not reached the NHL by 1964, he would quit the game and focus on his education.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Henderson attracted the attention of NHL scouts at the age of 15 when he scored 18 goals and 2 assists in a 21‚Äì6 victory in a juvenile playoff game. The junior affiliates of both the Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings offered him tryouts. He chose to sign with the Red Wings as their junior teams were based in Hamilton, which was closest to his home. He played the 1959‚Äì60 season with the Junior B Goderich Sailors and was the youngest player on the team. Henderson moved up to the Junior A Hamilton Red Wings in 1960‚Äì61 where he was an extra forward for much of the season. Returning to Hamilton in 1961‚Äì62, he became a regular player on the team, and recorded 24 goals and 43 points in 50 games.

Hamilton won the Ontario championship that season, then defeated the Quebec Citadelles in four consecutive games to win the eastern Canadian championship. Henderson scored a goal in the clinching game, a 9‚Äì3 win, that propelled the Red Wings to their first Memorial Cup final in the team&#x27;s history. They faced the Edmonton Oil Kings in the 1962 Memorial Cup final series. The Red Wings won the best-of-seven set 4‚Äì1 to capture the national championship. Henderson scored a goal in the deciding game, a 7‚Äì4 victory before over 7,000 fans at Kitchener, Ontario. He finished with seven goals and seven assists in 14 Memorial Cup playoff games.

Returning for a third season with Hamilton in 1962‚Äì63, Henderson led the Ontario Hockey Association in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of strep throat resulted in his missing Hamilton&#x27;s playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with only one shift in each game. In his first game, Henderson elbowed Dick Duff in the head, sparking a fight. He spent the rest of the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a slashing penalty during his only time on the ice. Henderson estimated that he was on the ice for only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine penalties in minutes.

===Detroit and Toronto===
After failing to make the Detroit roster out of training camp, Henderson was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets, to begin the 1963‚Äì64 season. He appeared in 38 games for the Hornets and his speed and aggressive nature helped him score 10 goals and 24 points. Henderson earned a brief recall to Detroit in November, then joined the NHL team permanently early in the new year. He scored his first NHL goal on January 29, 1964, against the Chicago Black Hawks. It came late in the game against goaltender Glenn Hall and resulted in a 2‚Äì2 tie. In 32 regular season NHL games, Henderson recorded three goals and three assists, then appeared in 14 playoff games where he added five more points. The Red Wings reached the 1964 Stanley Cup Finals, but lost in seven games to Toronto.

Henderson established himself as a full-time NHL player in 1964‚Äì65, though with limited ice time. He was used primarily in a defensive role and to kill penalties, scoring 8 goals and 21 points, while appearing in 70 games. Switching to the left wing in 1965‚Äì66, Henderson played a more offensive role and scored 22 goals. He added three more in 12 playoff games as the Red Wings reached the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals versus the Montreal Canadiens. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in the first game of the finals. After winning the first two games in Montreal, Detroit lost four straight and the series.

Seeking to double his $7,000 salary from the previous season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966‚Äì67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask to protect against the cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.

The Red Wings were in last place of the NHL&#x27;s East Division late in the 1967‚Äì68 season when, on March 4, 1968, they completed one of the biggest trades in league history up to that time: Henderson was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs as part of a six-player deal, along with Norm Ullman and Floyd Smith, in exchange for Frank Mahovlich, Garry Unger and Pete Stemkowski. Henderson finished the season with 11 points in 13 games for Toronto, then scored 27 goals and 59 points in 1968‚Äì69.

A groin injury plagued Henderson throughout much of the 1969‚Äì70 season, but he continued to play at the team&#x27;s request. He finished with 20 goals despite playing the entire season with pain. The Maple Leafs offered Henderson only a small raise, arguing that he did not deserve more because his offensive production had declined. The contract offer and the team&#x27;s indifference towards his injury left Henderson disillusioned with management&#x27;s attitude towards its players. Healthy in 1970‚Äì71, he scored 30 goals and an NHL career-high 60 points.

===Summit Series===

Canada had long been at a disadvantage in international ice hockey tournaments as its best players were professionals in the NHL and therefore ineligible to play at the ostensibly amateur World Championship and Olympic Games. The Soviets masked the status of their best players by having them serve in the military or hold other jobs affiliated with the teams, so they retained amateur status, even though playing hockey was their only occupational responsibility. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) promised to allow Canada to use a limited number of professional players at the 1970 tournament but later reneged, causing the nation to withdraw from all international competition. Officials in Canada and the Soviet Union subsequently negotiated an arrangement that would see the top players of each nation ‚Äì amateur or professional ‚Äì play in an eight-game &quot;Summit Series&quot; in September 1972 between the world&#x27;s two greatest hockey nations. Canadian fans and media approached the series with confidence; many predicted that the Canadian professionals would win all eight games.

Henderson&#x27;s 38-goal season in 1971‚Äì72, a career high, earned him a place on Team Canada&#x27;s roster. He scored a goal early in the first game, in Montreal, that gave Canada a 2‚Äì0 lead. The Soviet team then humbled the Canadians by scoring the next four goals and winning 7‚Äì3. A 4‚Äì1 Canadian win followed in the second game at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, but the Soviets overcame a 4‚Äì2 deficit, the fourth goal scored by Henderson, to tie the third game in Winnipeg. Canada lost the fourth game, 5‚Äì3, and were jeered by the fans in Vancouver as they headed to Moscow for the final four games with a series deficit. Henderson, like most of his teammates, was frustrated by his team&#x27;s play and the negative reaction they received from the crowd.

In the first game in Moscow, Henderson scored a goal to help Canada establish a 4‚Äì1 lead, but also suffered a concussion when he was tripped into the boards and knocked unconscious. He returned to finish the game, but the Soviets came back to win, 5‚Äì4, and were one victory shy of winning the series. In game six, Canada overcame what coach Harry Sinden called &quot;the worst officials I have ever seen in my life&quot; to win by a 3‚Äì2 score, with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal. The game was also notable for Bobby Clarke using his stick in a two-handed slash that broke Valeri Kharlamov&#x27;s ankle. Henderson later called the event &quot;the low point of the series&quot; during the 30th anniversary celebration, but apologized for his comments after Clarke took umbrage. Canada drew even in the series at three wins apiece, plus one tie, with a 4‚Äì3 victory in game seven. Henderson again scored the winner despite being tripped as he took the shot.
By the eighth game, the competition had become more than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5‚Äì3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw as a result of scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.

Sitting on the bench as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson &quot;had a feeling&quot; that he could score. He convinced coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer in front of the net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. As he got to his feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and lifted it over the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6‚Äì5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.

===World Hockey Association===
Henderson struggled to adjust to his new-found popularity. While he appreciated the support from fans and the business opportunities it created, he grew increasingly frustrated over time as the attention intruded on his private life. In his autobiography, &quot;Shooting for Glory&quot;, Henderson stated that the fame left him less satisfied than he had ever been. His frustrations with Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who Henderson felt was destroying the team, contributed to his developing an ulcer. (Henderson later admitted he was not mature enough at the time to deal with the acerbic Ballard). He briefly turned to alcohol as he struggled to deal with his situation. Henderson&#x27;s professional career reached its lowest point during the 1972‚Äì73 NHL season. He had become depressed, and by December, had scored only six goals. He struggled with a groin injury and played only 40 games for the Maple Leafs, who missed the playoffs.

Prior to the 1973‚Äì74 NHL season, Henderson spoke to John Bassett, owner of the World Hockey Association (WHA)&#x27;s Toronto Toros. Bassett offered Henderson a five-year contract worth twice his annual $75,000 salary from the Maple Leafs. The deal included a $50,000 signing bonus and performance bonuses based on how he played in his final year with the Maple Leafs. Henderson signed the contract, though he said in his autobiography that he regretted doing so before completing his term with his NHL club. A bitter opponent of the WHA, Ballard had vowed not to lose more players to the rival league. When he found out about the deal, he offered Henderson the same contract terms, but without a signing bonus. Upset at how stingy Ballard had been with his teammates, Henderson told Ballard to &quot;take this contract and shove it&quot;. An angered Ballard never forgave Henderson, and never spoke to him again.

Following a 24-goal campaign in his final season with the Maple Leafs, Henderson officially moved to the WHA where he played in another tournament against the Soviets. While the original series was restricted to players from the NHL, the 1974 Summit Series featured a Canadian team made up of WHA players. The series lacked the intensity of the original, yet Henderson felt that he played well: he scored two goals and an assist, and though Canada finished with one win, four losses and three ties, he felt the WHA had proven itself. Henderson scored 33 goals and 63 points in the 1974‚Äì75 WHA season for the Toros while playing 58 games. He missed the playoffs after tearing his knee ligaments in a game against the Phoenix Roadrunners when colliding with Bob Mowat, an opposing player during a line change.

Henderson scored 24 goals and 55 points in 1975‚Äì76, his last in Toronto. Following that season, the Toros relocated to Alabama where they became the Birmingham Bulls. While his contract stipulated he did not have to relocate with the team, Henderson appreciated the chance to move to a city where he could play in relative anonymity. He played the final three years of his contract in Birmingham, scoring 23, 37 and 24 goals, but made only one playoff appearance during his five WHA seasons, in 1978.

===Atlanta Flames===
The WHA merged with the NHL following the 1978‚Äì79 season. Birmingham was not invited to join the NHL; the team instead joined the Central Hockey League for the 1979‚Äì80 season and became a minor league affiliate of the Atlanta Flames. Henderson considered retiring, but his family had settled in Birmingham and he knew they could remain in the United States only as long as he was employed. The Flames offered him a spot on their roster, but he preferred to remain with his family. He signed a two-year contract with the Flames on the promise that he would stay in Birmingham unless the team needed his services as a result of injury to other players. He spent the majority of the season in Birmingham, but when Atlanta did struggle with injuries, they recalled him for 30 games where he scored seven goals and six assists. Henderson also appeared in four playoff games. In his final game at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens, Henderson led the Flames to a 5‚Äì1 win over the Maple Leafs with a two-goal effort, resulting in his being named the game&#x27;s first star.

Henderson intended the 1980‚Äì81 season to be his last as a player. He was again offered a spot on the Flames, in part to help develop the team&#x27;s young players, but the franchise had relocated to Canada to become the Calgary Flames and Henderson chose to remain with Birmingham, as a player and assistant coach. He missed several games due to injuries but scored six goals in 33 games. However, the Bulls fell into financial difficulty and on February 23, 1981, the team ceased operations mid-season. Choosing not to leave his Birmingham home, Henderson retired as a player and spent the remainder of the season as a scout for the Flames.

==Legacy==

Though he was not considered a good puck handler, Henderson was a fast skater and was known for his skills at shooting the puck. His career spanned 19 professional seasons during which he played over 1,000 major league games in the NHL and WHA. He scored 376 goals and 760 points between the two leagues and was a two-time NHL all-star, playing in the 1972 and 1973 All-Star Games. His career, however, was defined by the goal he scored on September 28, 1972, to win the Summit Series for Canada. It is the most famous goal in Canadian hockey history and was the defining moment for a generation of Canadians. Decades later, Henderson remains a national hero. The &quot;Canadian Press&quot; named Henderson&#x27;s goal the &quot;sports moment of the century&quot; in 2000. The jersey worn by Henderson when he scored the goal was sold at auction for over $1 million in 2010, thought to be the highest price ever paid for a hockey sweater.

Frank Lennon&#x27;s photograph, taken moments after the goal and showing a jubilant Henderson being embraced by Yvan Cournoyer, has been &quot;etched into the visual cortex of every Canadian&quot;. The photo won a National Newspaper Award and has been reproduced by the Royal Canadian Mint on coins. It was also named &quot;Canadian Press&quot; photograph of the year.

Sportswriters and fans have frequently called for Henderson to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson&#x27;s status as hero of the &quot;greatest series in hockey history&quot; was enough to qualify him. Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: &quot;So many Canadians get upset that I‚Äôm not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn‚Äôt vote for me. Quite frankly, I didn‚Äôt have a Hall of Fame career.&quot; Henderson has been honoured by Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in the 2013 Canadian honours in recognition of &quot;his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes&quot; along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.

==Personal life==
Henderson and his wife Eleanor have three daughters: Heather, Jennifer and Jill. The family remained in Birmingham for a time following his retirement as a player. He had an opportunity to become a colour commentator for Maple Leafs broadcasts in 1981 but Ballard, still upset that Henderson had defected to the WHA, prevented his hiring. In Birmingham, he became a stockbroker, briefly joining brokerage firm E. F. Hutton. However, he was unable to get a work permit in the United States despite a petition signed by thousands of Birmingham residents who fought for him to stay.

Following the high of the 1972 Summit Series and the personal lows that came after, Henderson struggled with a sense of discontentment. He turned to religion, becoming a born-again Christian in 1975. Unable to work as a broker, Henderson entered the seminary and studied to become a minister. When he finally gave up his efforts to acquire an American work visa in 1984, he returned to Toronto. Under the auspices of Power to Change Ministries, formerly Campus Crusade for Christ Canada, he founded a men&#x27;s ministry in Ontario called LeaderImpact and travels across Canada giving talks and speeches, particularly to businessmen. He has received an honorary doctorate from Briercrest College and Seminary and an honorary degree from Tyndale University College and Seminary.

Henderson is also a published author. His autobiography, &quot;Shooting for Glory&quot;, was released in 1992. With Jim Prime, he co-authored the 2011 book &quot;How Hockey Explains Canada&quot;, an exploration of the relationship between the sport and Canadian culture. He released a memoir in 2012 called &quot;The Goal of My Life&quot; with Roger Lajoie.

The death of his father due to heart problems at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in his own heart that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations of the Summit Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.

<text>Interstate¬†10 (I-10) is the southernmost transcontinental highway in the Interstate Highway System of the United States. It is the fourth-longest Interstate in the country at , following I-90, I-80, and I-40. It was part of the originally planned Interstate Highway network that was laid out in 1956, and its last section was completed in 1990.

I-10 stretches from the Pacific Ocean at State Route¬†1 (SR¬†1, Pacific Coast Highway) in Santa Monica, California, to I-95 in Jacksonville, Florida. Other major cities connected by I-10 include (from west to east) Los Angeles, Phoenix, Las Cruces, El Paso, San Antonio, Houston, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulfport, Mobile, Pensacola, and Tallahassee. Over one-third of its total length is within the state of Texas, where the freeway spans the state at its widest breadth.

=== California ===

Between its west terminus in Santa Monica, California, and the major East Los Angeles Interchange, I-10 is known as the Santa Monica Freeway. The Santa Monica Freeway is also called the Rosa Parks Freeway, named after the civil rights activist, for the segment beginning at I-405 (San Diego Freeway), and ending at I-110/SR¬†110 (Harbor Freeway). The segment between the East Los Angeles Interchange, in East Los Angeles, and the city of San Bernardino, long, is called the San Bernardino Freeway. 

Other names exist for I-10. For example, from 1976 to 2022, a sign near the western terminus of the highway in Santa Monica proclaimed the highway to be the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway. The state legislature authorized its removal in 2022 after years of lobbying by Native Americans. 

I-10 is known to a considerably lesser degree as the Veterans Memorial Highway, and it is listed as a Blue Star Memorial Highway. In Palm Springs, I-10 is also named the Sonny Bono Memorial Freeway, named after the singer, actor, and politician, as a tribute to the late entertainer who served both as the mayor of Palm Springs, and as a US Representative. Another stretch a short distance east in Indio is proclaimed the Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway, named after the nurse known for popularizing road lane striping.

=== Arizona ===

In Arizona, the highway is designated the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway. The portion through Phoenix is named the Papago Freeway, and it is a vital piece of the metropolitan Phoenix freeway system. This designation starts at State Route¬†101 (SR¬†101; Loop¬†101), near 99th Avenue, and continues eastward to the interchange southeast of downtown, which is the terminus of I-17.

Near Buckeye, the freeway has milemarkers posted every from 112.2 to 110.8 with the Interstate shield and direction of travel posted on the westbound lanes. On the eastbound lanes, milemarkers from 110.8 to 112.2 do not include the I‚Äë10 shield and direction of travel.

From the southern terminus of I-17 to the southernmost junction with SR¬†202 (Loop¬†202), the highway is signed as the Maricopa Freeway. This name holds true as well for I-17 from its southern terminus to the Durango Curve south of Buckeye Road. From Loop¬†202 south to the eastern terminus of I-8 just southeast of Casa Grande, the highway is declared the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway. The Arizona Department of Transportation also has maps that show it as the Maricopa Freeway, while the American Automobile Association and other sources show it as the Pima Freeway. The latter&#x27;s name is used on a stretch of Loop¬†101 from Loop¬†202 to I-17.

Between I-17 in Phoenix and the I-19 interchanges in Tucson, I-10 is included in the federally designated CANAMEX Corridor, extending from Mexico City, Mexico, to Edmonton, Alberta.

In Tucson, between I-10 mileposts¬†259 and 260 are interchange ramps connecting I-10 with the northern terminus of I-19.

The highest elevation along I-10 occurs just east of Tucson, west of Willcox, at the milemarker¬†320 exit for the rest stop. The westbound lanes of I-10 briefly cross above above sea level.

=== New Mexico ===

In New Mexico, I-10 more or less follows the former path of US Route¬†80 (US¬†80) across the state, although major portions of old US¬†80 were bypassed in the western New Mexico Bootheel and in Do√±a Ana County. I-10 passes through three southern New Mexico municipalities of regional significance before the junction with I-25: Lordsburg, Deming, and Las Cruces. Most of I-10 in New Mexico, between exit¬†24 and exit¬†135, is concurrent with US¬†70.

At Lordsburg is the western junction of US¬†70 and a concurrency; the two highways are joined all the way to Las Cruces. Several exits between Lordsburg and Deming are either for former towns (including Separ, Quincy, and Gage) or lack any town at all.

At Deming is the western junction of US¬†180, which also forms a concurrency with I-10 all the way to El Paso. north of Deming on US¬†180 is State Road¬†26 (NM¬†26) which serves as a short cut to north I-25 and Albuquerque.

I-10/US¬†70/US¬†180 continue east to Las Cruces which is the southern end of I-25. US¬†70 leaves I-10 (prior to the junction with I-25), heading northeast to Alamogordo and passing through the north side of Las Cruces. The junction with I-25 occurs just south of the New Mexico State University campus, on the southern end of Las Cruces. I-10/US¬†180 becomes concurrent with US¬†85 at the junction with I-25. I-10/US¬†85/US¬†180 then turns south to the Texas state line, crossing it at Anthony.

=== Texas ===

From the state line with New Mexico (at Anthony) to State Highway¬†20 (SH¬†20) in west El Paso, I-10 is bordered by frontage roads South Desert for lanes along I-10 east (actually headed south) and North Desert for lanes along I-10 west (headed north). The Interstate then has no frontage roads for but regains them east of downtown and retains them to Clint. In this stretch, the frontage roads are Gateway East for the eastbound lanes and Gateway West for the westbound lanes. All four frontage roads are one-way streets. Gateway East and Gateway West are notable, in particular, for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)&#x27;s liberal usage of the Texas U-turn at most underpasses of I-10 on this stretch.

I-10 is the western terminus for I-20, and the two highways intersect in Reeves County, about southwest of Pecos, at milemarker¬†186.

A small portion of I-10 from Loop¬†1604 to Downtown San Antonio is known as the Northwest Expressway or the McDermott Freeway, while another portion from downtown to Loop¬†1604 east is called East Expressway or Jos√© L√≥pez Freeway. In Downtown San Antonio, it has a concurrency with I-35, and, throughout most of the northwest side of the city, it has a concurrency with US¬†87, which begins in Comfort, before turning off and heading east out of the city. Starting in San Antonio, it follows a more direct route of US¬†90, with occasional small concurrences.

In Houston, from the western suburb of Katy to downtown, I-10 is commonly known as the Katy Freeway. This section has as many as 18¬†lanes (12¬†main lanes and 6 mid-freeway high-occupancy toll [HOT]/high-occupancy vehicle [HOV] lanes, not counting access road turning lanes) and is one of the widest freeways in the world. The space for the expansion was the right-of-way of the old Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad. The section east of Downtown Houston is officially known as the East Freeway, although it is widely known by locals as the Baytown East Freeway due to a marketing push by Baytown, one of the largest cities in Greater Houston.

In Beaumont, it is known as I-10 south, south of Calder Avenue, and I-10 north, north of Calder Avenue. It is known as I-10 east from the I-10 curve to the Neches River, which is Beaumont&#x27;s and Jefferson County&#x27;s eastern boundary line. Continuing into Orange County and passing through the city of Orange at the easternmost end of Texas, and located at the base of the Sabine River bridge is the last I-10 milemarker in Texas, number¬†880, before entering into Louisiana. Approximately 36¬†percent of I-10&#x27;s entire route is located within Texas; the longest segment of any signed Interstate within one state.

=== Louisiana ===

In Lake Charles, a loop route signed as I-210 branches off of I-10 and goes through the southern portion of the city. In Lafayette, it serves as the southern terminus for I-49. Shortly afterward, there is an stretch of elevated highway between Lafayette and Baton Rouge known as the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway, as it goes over the Atchafalaya River, across the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge, and the adjacent swamps. It crosses the Mississippi River at the Horace Wilkinson Bridge in Baton Rouge, where the eastbound lanes are the only portion of I-10 that is essentially one lane. After crossing the Horace Wilkinson Bridge, two lanes from I-110 south merge with two lanes I-10 east into three lanes with one of the eastbound lanes quickly becoming an exit only lane. After this, the highway is back to four lanes approaching the I-10/I-12 split. I-12 links Baton Rouge to Slidell and bypasses I-10&#x27;s southward jog through New Orleans by remaining north of Lake Pontchartrain. On this route, I-10 serves as the southern terminus for I-55 in LaPlace and crosses over a portion of Lake Pontchartrain on the I-10 Bonnet Carr√© Spillway Bridge. In New Orleans, a stretch of I-10 from the I-10/I-610 Junction near the Orleans‚ÄìJefferson parish line to the US¬†90/US¬†90 Business (US¬†90 Bus.) junction is known as the Pontchartrain Expressway. A dip near the I-10/I-610 junction to travel under a railroad track is one of the lowest points in New Orleans and is highly susceptible to flooding. Buildups of rainwater dozens of feet deep (several meters) are commonplace during hurricanes. Near Slidell, I-10 serves as the eastern terminus of I-12 and the southern terminus of I-59; turning east to the Mississippi state line. The highway is known as the Stephen Ambrose Memorial Highway, named after the historian and writer, until the state line.

I-310 and I-510 are the built sections of what was slated to be I-410, which would have acted as a southern bypass of New Orleans. They function as spur routes serving lower density or suburban areas west and east of New Orleans respectively. I-610 is a shortcut from the eastern to western portion of New Orleans avoiding I-10&#x27;s detour into the New Orleans Central Business District.

=== Mississippi ===

I-10 in Mississippi runs from the Louisiana state line to the Alabama state line through Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson counties on the Gulf Coast. It passes through the northern sections of Gulfport and Biloxi while passing just north of Pascagoula and Bay St. Louis. It also passes right south of the NASA Stennis Space Center. The highway roughly parallels US¬†90.

The law defining the route of I-10 is Mississippi Code ¬ß¬†65-3-3.

=== Alabama ===

I-10 crosses over the border from Jackson County, Mississippi, and it goes through Mobile County in southwestern Alabama. In Mobile, I-10 is the southern terminus of I-65. In downtown Mobile, I-10 goes through one of the few highway tunnels in Alabama, the George Wallace Tunnel under the Mobile River.

The speed limit of the eastbound approach is posted at because of the sharp downward curve approaching the tunnel. The highway then crosses approximately of the upper part of Mobile Bay on the Jubilee Parkway, a bridge that local people call the &quot;Bayway&quot;. The highway is next to Battleship Parkway. On the other side of Mobile Bay, the highway goes through the suburban area of Baldwin County before passing through Malbis, Loxley, and then on to the Perdido River to cross over into Florida.

=== Florida ===

I-10 travels north of the cities of Pensacola and Tallahassee, serving the suburban areas within each respective city. In the former, a spur route serves the downtown area, signed as I-110. Most of I-10 in Florida travels through some of the least-populated areas in the state, with large portions of I-10 west of I-295 in Jacksonville having only four lanes.

In Jacksonville, as in Arizona, I-10 is designated as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway. The route officially ends at the I-10/I-95 interchange northwest of Downtown Jacksonville. Throughout much of Florida, I-10 is also State Road¬†8 (SR¬†8), though it is not signed as such. (I-110 in Pensacola being known as SR¬†8A.)

== History ==

While the highway has existed as far back as 1957, the last section of the entire route to be completed was a section of the Papago Freeway from both I-17 interchanges (including the Deck Park Tunnel) in Phoenix, which opened in 1990.

Many widening projects have taken place on the interstate in the late 2000s. In Pensacola, Florida, a stretch of I-10 was widened to six lanes in 2008. In Tallahassee, Florida, construction was completed in June 2009 on a project to widen a roughly stretch of I-10 to six lanes (eight in some places). In Tucson, Arizona, all exits between Prince Road and 22nd Street reopened after an extensive, three-year improvement project. I-10 was widened from six to eight lanes, and seven bridges and underpasses have been built to deal with congestion. I-10 from the I-8 interchange in Casa Grande to Marana was widened from four to six lanes from the second half of 2007, to its completion in 2009. Also in Arizona, from Verrado Way in Verrado, Buckeye, all the way to Avondale, the Interstate was widened throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s, with an HOV lane added between Estrella Parkway in Goodyear and Loop¬†101.

Texas formerly shared the highest speed limit in the nation with Utah&#x27;s test section of I-15. The speed limit along I-10 from Kerr County to El Paso County was raised by the Texas Legislature to in 1999 and to in 2006. However, the nighttime maximum speed limit remained , and the daytime truck speed limit was . With of highway in Texas, the stretch of I-10, and of I-20, between Monahans and the I-10 interchange at the cusp of the Davis Mountains, only a small percentage of roads were affected. On September 1, 2011, nighttime speed limits were eliminated, and the statutory maximum speed limit in Texas was increased from .

As far back as the 1990s, Florida and Alabama have considered a connector that would link Dothan, Alabama, with I-10. In 2008, a proposal to make this new highway a toll road and to expedite its construction to complete it in five years surfaced. In 2012, federal funds previously set aside for the connector were allocated to other projects. In 2014, Florida sought bids for a feasibility study.

<text>Rosamund Clifford (possibly before 1140 1176), often called &quot;The Fair Rosamund&quot; or &quot;Rose of the World&quot; (Latin: &quot;rosa mundi&quot;), was a medieval English noblewoman and mistress of Henry II, King of England. She became famous in English folklore.

==Life==

=== Early life ===

Rosamund Clifford was the daughter of Walter de Clifford, a marcher lord, and his wife Margaret de Toeni. Her date of birth is uncertain. Some sources place it in 1140 or possibly even earlier, possibly due to the traditional identification of Rosamond as the mother of at least one of Henry II&#x27;s illegitimate children (William the Longespee and Geoffrey, the archbishop of York) - indicating that she had already become Henry II&#x27;s mistress by the early 1150s. On the other hand, Gerald of Wales describes her as a &quot;puella&quot; (a girl or a young woman) at the time of her death in 1176. She was certainly of age by 1166. Rosamund had three brothers, Walter (), Richard and Gilbert, and two sisters: Amice, and Lucy.

Her name likely came from the Latin phrase &quot;rosa mundi&quot;, meaning &quot;rose of the world.&quot; Clifford was first raised at her father&#x27;s Clifford Castle, then sent to a convent of Benedictine nuns in Godstow Abbey for education.

=== Henry II&#x27;s mistress ===
Clifford was reputed as one of the greatest beauties of the 12th century. Her relationship with Henry II, King of England (1133‚Äì1189) supposedly started when his wife, Queen Eleanor () was pregnant with their last child, John (1166‚Äì1216) in 1166, but the king publicly acknowledged the affair for the first time in 1174. The queen is thought to have given birth to John in Beaumount Palace instead of Woodstock Palace because Clifford lived at Woodstock. Alison Weir in her biography of Eleanor, thinks this unlikely and dismisses it as &quot;another example of the unsupported fictions that have attached themselves to Rosamund&#x27;s name&quot;. Accounts differ on whether Clifford stayed in Woodstock while the king was travelling between England and his continental lands or accompanied him. If she did not go with him, they could not have spent more than about a quarter of the time between 1166 and 1176 together.

=== Later life and death ===

When her relationship with the king ended, Rosamund retired to Godstow Abbey. She died there around 1176, before the age of 40, and she was buried there. Her death was commemorated at Hereford Cathedral on 6 July, the same day on which Henry II died, 13 years after her. The king and the Clifford family paid for her tomb to be cared for by the Benedictine nuns of the convent. Her resting place became a popular shrine among locals, which was noticed by Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln in 1191. Seeing the flowers and candles that covered the tomb, he ordered her remains to be moved and buried outside, &quot;with the rest, that the Christian religion may not grow into contempt, and that other women, warned by her example, may abstain from illicit and adulterous intercourse&quot;. Complying with the bishop&#x27;s request, Clifford&#x27;s body was moved to the cemetery by the nuns&#x27; chapter house and was destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries (1536‚Äì1541) under Henry VIII. The ruins of the abbey still stand and are open to the public.

Paul Hentzner, a German traveller who visited England around 1599, recorded that her faded tombstone inscription read in part:

Followed by a rhyming epitaph:

Accounts from the time of its destruction report that, along with other engravings, the tomb contained the depiction of a chalice.

==In folklore==
In English folklore, Rosamund&#x27;s legend states that the king did everything to hide his affair from his wife, Queen Eleanor. He saw Rosamund only in the middle of a complicated underground labyrinth in the park of Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire. Following rumours, the queen made her way through the labyrinth and confronted her rival, forcing her to choose between a dagger and a bowl of poison; Rosamund chose the poison and died. Contemporary chronicler John Brompton did not recount this incident in his account of the events, and it first appeared in the 14th-century &quot;French Chronicle of London.&quot;

Another version tells that Rosamund was roasted between two fires, stabbed, and left to bleed to death in a bath of scalding water by the queen. During the Elizabethan era, such stories gained popularity, leading to the writing of the &quot;Ballad of Fair Rosamund&quot; by Thomas Deloney (1612) and the &quot;Complaint of Rosamund&quot; by Samuel Daniel (1592), both being purely fictional. The underground labyrinth was added to the tale in 1516 (although Robert Gambles cites a 1231 reference to &quot;Rosamund&#x27;s chamber&quot;, with gardens, a cloister and a well), drawing on the story of Estrildis, mistress of king Locrinus, who had underground apartments built to hide her from his wife. The cup of poison first appears in a ballad in 1611.

According to most medieval chroniclers, Queen Eleanor had been imprisoned by 1173 for raising her sons to be rebellious against their father, making a direct confrontation between the two women highly improbable.

=== Possible issue ===
Historians are divided whether Clifford&#x27;s relationship with Henry II produced children. Legends have attributed to her two of the king&#x27;s illegitimate sons, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York () and William Longesp√©e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (c. 1176 ‚Äì 1226). However, Geoffrey was born before the king and Clifford even met from an otherwise unknown woman (possibly called Ykenai or Hikenai), and William was the son of Ida de Tosny, Countess of Norfolk (died after 1181).
=== Fair Rosamund&#x27;s Well and Rosamund&#x27;s Green ===
According to local tales, &quot;Rosamund&#x27;s bower&quot; (probably an early version of the labyrinth) was demolished when Blenheim Palace was built. Today, Fair Rosamund&#x27;s Well () is a paved spring in the park of Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire. It is located to the south of the Grand Bridge on the western shore of The Lake, sometimes called Brown&#x27;s Lake after 18th-century landscape architect Capability Brown. According to a 2014 BBC article, &quot;[T]he well had become &#x27;somewhat overgrown and at risk of becoming damaged&#x27;&quot;.

Rosamund is also associated with the village of Frampton on Severn, Gloucestershire, another of her father&#x27;s holdings. Walter de Clifford granted the mill there to Godstow Abbey for the good of the souls of his wife and daughter. The village green of Frampton became known as Rosamund&#x27;s Green by the 17th century.

=== &quot;Rosa mundi&quot; rose ===
A cultivated variation of &quot;Rosa gallica&quot; with striped pink blooms is commonly known as &quot;rosa mundi&quot;. Its connection to Rosamund Clifford dates to the 16th century.

<text>Tommy Burns (born Noah Brusso; 17 June 188110 May 1955) was a Canadian professional boxer. He is the only Canadian-born World Heavyweight Boxing Champion. The first to travel the globe in defending his title, Burns made 13 title defences against 11 different boxers, despite often being the underdog due to his size. Burns took on all challengers as Heavyweight Champion, leading to his legendary bout with the African American Jack Johnson. According to his biographer, Burns insisted, &quot;I will defend my title against all comers, none barred. By this I mean white, black, Mexican, Indian, or any other nationality. I propose to be the champion of the world, not the white, or the Canadian, or the American. If I am not the best man in the heavyweight division, I don&#x27;t want the title.&quot;

==Early life==
Noah Brusso was born in Normanby Township near Hanover, Ontario, as the twelfth of thirteen children of an impoverished German-Canadian family. His family lived in several locations around Ontario&#x27;s Grey County and Bruce County before moving to Galt, Ontario. Noah grew up in difficult circumstances; five of his siblings died before reaching adulthood. Brusso began his prizefighting career in 1900 in Detroit, Michigan. In June 1903, he was discovered playing lacrosse under an assumed name for a Detroit team that was playing in Chatham, Ontario.

==Boxing career==
After starting his boxing career under his real name, in 1904 Brusso took the Scottish-sounding name of Tommy Burns. He was tall and about , but his relatively small size did not stop him from becoming the world heavyweight boxing champion. When Burns met Marvin Hart for the heavyweight championship of the world in Los Angeles on 23 February 1906, Burns was a 2-1 underdog and the betting was 10-7 that he would not last ten rounds. Burns won a 20-round decision and went on to defend his title eleven times within a period of less than three years.

All previous gloved world champs had been European-American U.S. citizens (except for Robert Fitzsimmons, of the United Kingdom and New Zealand), who defended their titles only against other white opponents (although Fitzsimmons fought Jack Johnson after losing the title). Burns travelled the globe, beating the champions of England, Ireland, France and Australia. It is generally believed that Burns was the first heavyweight champion to fight with a Jewish challenger, defeating British boxer Joseph &quot;Jewey&quot; Smith, in a 1908 bout held in Paris. However, &quot;Jewey&quot; was a diminutive of Joseph, not a reference to Smith&#x27;s religion. 
However, writing in the Classic Boxing Forum on 12 September 2018, Rochelle Solomon said &quot;Jewey Smith was my great grandfather. He was born Joseph Goldblum. He was indeed Jewish.&quot;

Burns once defended his title twice in one night, although some historians refuse to accept those wins as title defences, insisting they were exhibition bouts. But in newspapers at the time, they were advertised as heavyweight title fights. If those defences are counted in his record, he successfully defended his title 13 times.
In December 1908, after months of delaying arranging the fight, Burns agreed to a bout with Jack Johnson and became the first fighter to hold to a heavyweight championship bout with an African American. Burns lost his title in the match held in Sydney. The fight was ended in the 14th of 20 three minute rounds with Burns failing to land a punch, and being clearly unable to continue. He had refused to fight Johnson until Australian promoter Hugh D. McIntosh paid him $30,000 for the fight (Johnson received $5,000). Burns was rumoured to be suffering from the effects from jaundice or influenza, and weighed in at ‚Äî lighter than his previous fight, and well below Johnson&#x27;s . The fight lasted fourteen rounds before being stopped by the police. Burns later claimed the disruption was due to spectators&#x27; concern he had a broken jaw. He also stated numerous right uppercuts from Johnson led to swelling on his face and the request to stop the fight. Referee Hugh McIntosh awarded the decision and the title to Johnson.

In a filmed interview, Burns ranked Johnson as the second-best boxer up to his time, after James J. Jeffries. Johnson defeated Jeffries in 1910 when Jeffries, who hadn&#x27;t fought for six years, came out of retirement to fight. It is said that Jeffries was grossly out of shape and had lost much of his muscle, but films of the fight show that Jeffries was in perfect condition on the day of the fight. It was ring rust, and the natural effects of age, that caused him to fight badly against Johnson.

In 1909 in Vancouver, B.C., Johnson told a crowd of people that Burns deserved credit as the only white heavyweight who ever gave a black man a chance to win the title. He said, &quot;Let me say of Mr. Burns, a Canadian and one of yourselves, that he has done what no one else ever did, he gave a black man a chance for the championship. He was beaten, but he was game.&quot;

Burns continued to box occasionally after dropping the title. During the Great War he joined the Canadian army, serving as a physical fitness instructor for troops in Canada. In 1920, one month after his 39th birthday, Burns challenged British champion Joe Beckett. Burns was stopped in the seventh round when, after suffering two knockdowns, his corner threw in the towel to end the fight.

== Life after boxing==

After retirement, Burns promoted some boxing shows. In 1928 he moved to New York City where he ran a speakeasy. Although he was wealthy at the end of his boxing career, the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression wiped out his fortune. Burns went to work as an insurance salesman and security guard, among other jobs.

In 1948, Burns was ordained as a minister. At the time of his death, he was an evangelist living in Coalinga, California. 

He died while visiting a church friend in Vancouver, British Columbia, suffering a heart attack at age 73. Four people attended his burial at Ocean View Cemetery in Burnaby, British Columbia. He was interred in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. In 1961 a Vancouver sports writer raised funds to commission a memorial plaque for Burns&#x27;s grave.

==Legacy==

Burns is best remembered today as the man whom Jack Johnson beat to become the first black heavyweight champion. Yet Burns was the first truly international heavyweight champion, defending his title in America, England, Ireland, France and Australia. His 1907 title defence against Gunner Moir in London was the first World Heavyweight championship fight of the gloved era to be held outside of the United States. Standing at just 5&#x27;7&quot;, Burns is the shortest heavyweight champion in history, while only Bob Fitzsimmons weighed less in a world heavyweight title fight than Burns&#x27;s 168¬Ω lbs when losing the championship to Jack Johnson. During his championship reign, Burns typically weighed between 170 and 180 lbs. His reach was 74&quot;, three inches longer than Mike Tyson&#x27;s.

Burns&#x27;s eight consecutive title defences by knockout or stoppage is equalled only by Larry Holmes and remains a record for the heavyweight division. Burns was the first World Heavyweight champion to win the title on points. Although physically over-matched against Johnson, who handed him his first stoppage loss, it is notable that Burns did not lose inside the distance again until the final fight of his career, at the age of 39. It should be noted, however, that some sources record the result as Johnson having won the title on points after the bout was stopped by the police. The filming of the fight was stopped due to the one-sided nature of the contest, however, and regardless of the official ruling, is generally considered by historians to be a stoppage victory for Johnson.

Burns&#x27;s reign as heavyweight champion lasted for two years, ten months and three days, the 19th-longest reign in heavyweight history. His eleven consecutive successful title defences is the joint-fourth highest total in heavyweight history, alongside Vitali Klitschko and behind Wladimir Klitschko (18 defences), Larry Holmes (20 defences) and Joe Louis (25 defences). Many of Burns&#x27;s title challengers, however, were not of World Championship quality, as he frequently defended against the best available local heavyweights while touring the world. In Burns&#x27;s first defense of the title, for instance, he knocked out James J. Walker in the first round. Walker&#x27;s record going into the bout was 1‚Äì5 and he had lost by stoppage in five of his previous six bouts prior to challenging Burns.

Burns also defended the title three times against Bill Squires. Squires, the Australian heavyweight champion, was actually a 10‚Äì9 favourite to defeat Burns, yet lost in the first round. Nevertheless, Squires obtained two further shots at Burns&#x27;s title, despite losing two of his next three fights following their first bout. His trilogy with Burns is notable, however, as their title fights took place across three different continents (America, Europe and Australia). This remains the only instance in history where two boxers have fought three times for a World title with each fight taking place on a different continent. Burns&#x27;s best win as champion was a 20-round points decision over Philadelphia Jack O&#x27;Brien, who two years previously had stopped Bob Fitzsimmons to claim the World light-Heavyweight championship.

Footage of his 1907 title defence against Bill Lang shows Burns to have been an aggressive counter-puncher, who was strong on the inside and a good finisher. 
Although Trevor Berbick and Bermane Stiverne have also won a version of the World Heavyweight Championship while Canadian citizens, Burns remains the only Canadian-born heavyweight champion in history. (Berbick and Stiverne were born in Jamaica and Haiti respectively.)

==Honours==
Australian boxer and Welterweight champion Geoffrey Mostyn Murphy would fight under the ring name &quot;Tommy Burns&quot;, in honour of his Canadian namesake.

Burns has since been posthumously inducted into the following sporting institutions: the Canadian Boxing Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1955, the International Boxing Hall of Fame on 9 June 1996, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="86408" wikidata="Q93395" url="?curid=86408" title="Interstate 12">
<text>Interstate¬†12 (I-12) is an intrastate Interstate Highway located entirely within the US state of Louisiana. It spans a total of in an east‚Äìwest direction from I-10 in Baton Rouge to an interchange with both I-10 and I-59 in Slidell. Along the way, it passes through the city of Hammond, where it intersects I-55 and US Route¬†51 (US¬†51). It also serves the cities of Ponchatoula and Denham Springs, as well as the St. Tammany Parish cities of Covington and Mandeville.

I-12 parallels the older US¬†190 corridor and traverses the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in the southeastern portion of the state. The Interstate&#x27;s length is short for a mainline Interstate and is comparable with the country&#x27;s longest auxiliary Interstates. It is one of the shortest mainline Interstates to terminate at the same route (I-10) at either end. Apart from serving the various communities of the North Shore, I-12 acts as a long bypass of New Orleans and is heavily used as a shortcut for through traffic on I-10. While I-10 curves to the south to pass through the city limits, I-12 takes a more direct alignment, reducing the distance between Baton Rouge and Slidell by about .

In 1993, the Louisiana State Legislature designated I-12 as the Republic of West Florida Parkway. In 2003, signs identifying the highway&#x27;s official name and bearing the flag of the Republic of West Florida were erected by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) in order to highlight the unique history of Louisiana&#x27;s Florida Parishes.

Louisiana is in the process of widening I-12 to three lanes in each direction in locations such as Covington and Mandeville where the Interstate is still two lanes in each direction.

==Route description==


===Baton Rouge to Hammond===
From the west, I-12 begins east of downtown Baton Rouge in East Baton Rouge Parish at an interchange with I-10 known as the I-10/I-12 split. While I-10 heads to the southeast toward the New Orleans metropolitan area, I-12 proceeds eastward toward the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Before leaving Baton Rouge, I-12 intersects some of its major arteries, including Louisiana Highway¬†3064 (LA¬†3064; Essen Lane) and LA¬†73 (Jefferson Highway) via LA¬†1068 (Drusilla Lane). It then passes through a cloverleaf interchange with US¬†61 (Airline Highway). These three exits serve several of the area&#x27;s key medical and shopping centers, such as the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center and Cortana Mall. The final exit in Baton Rouge is an interchange with LA¬†3245 (O&#x27;Neal Lane), which serves the Ochsner Medical Center ‚Äì Baton Rouge and eastern suburbs.

I-12 reaches the Amite River later, where it enters Livingston Parish and the city of Denham Springs. I-12 skirts the southern edge of town, providing interchanges with LA¬†3002 (South Range Avenue) and LA¬†1026 (Juban Road). East of Denham springs, I-12 skirts the southern edge of Livingston Parish&#x27;s only other city, Walker. The interstate&#x27;s sole exit in Walker is exit¬†15, an interchange with LA¬†447.

Past Walker are smaller communities in the eastern half of the parish. Exits include: LA¬†63 serving Livingston (exit¬†22), LA¬†441 serving Holden (exit¬†29), and LA¬†43 serving Albany and Springfield (exit¬†32).

Shortly after crossing the Natalbany River into Tangipahoa Parish, I-12 intersects LA¬†1249, which leads to the communities of Baptist and Pumpkin Center. I-12 enters into a cloverleaf interchange later with I-55 at the southeast corner of Hammond, the largest city in Tangipahoa Parish. I-55 heads toward Jackson, Mississippi, on the north and New Orleans on the south. after, US¬†51 crosses I-12, but the two roads do not intersect. There is instead an interchange with US¬†51 Business, which serves downtown Hammond, as well as the city of Ponchatoula to the south.

===Hammond to Slidell===
East of Hammond are two rural exits in southeastern Tangipahoa Parish: LA¬†3158 (Airport Road) to Hammond Northshore Regional Airport and LA¬†445 to Robert.

Just after crossing into St. Tammany Parish, I-12 curves to the southeast and begins to parallel the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain. An interchange with LA¬†1077 serves the town of Madisonville to the south. The following exit, an interchange with LA¬†21, also connects to Madisonville as well as the parish seat of Covington to the north. Immediately before crossing the Tchefuncte River, an exit to Pinnacle Parkway and East Brewster Road serves the growing shopping area east of LA¬†21.

 east of the bridge, I-12 passes through an interchange with US¬†190 between Covington and Mandeville. This section of US¬†190 serves as St. Tammany Parish&#x27;s busiest north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare, connecting Covington and surrounding points with the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, a bridge leading to New Orleans. Further exits in St. Tammany Parish west of Slidell include LA¬†59 to Mandeville and Abita Springs, LA¬†1088 to LA¬†36, and LA¬†434 to Lacombe.

I-12 passes through an interchange with Airport Drive east of the Lacombe exit, which connects to Slidell Airport due north. At this exit, I-12 enters the northern edge of Slidell. An interchange with US¬†11 connects to the downtown area. Less than later, I-12 reaches its eastern terminus at a major interchange with I-10 and I-59 at the northeast corner of town. From this interchange, I-10 heads southwest toward New Orleans and east toward Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, while I-59 heads north toward Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

==History==
I-12 was added to the highway system on October 17, 1957, with I-12 running from I-10 in Baton Rouge to I-59 north of Slidell. By the mid-1960s, the routes had been realigned to their current configuration, with I-12 and I-59 both ending at I-10 near Slidell. The route was opened to traffic in several sections between January 1967 and June 1976.

With major damage to the I-10 Twin Span Bridge across Lake Pontchartrain from Hurricane Katrina, I-12 was temporarily functioning as I-10 between Baton Rouge and Slidell. On October 14, 2005, the eastbound span of I-10 over Lake Pontchartrain reopened to two-way traffic. The westbound span of I-10 reopened on January 6, 2006, with speed, weight and size restrictions, relieving I-12 of much of the congestion that was clogging it from the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway to the junction with I-10 and I-59.

Since 2012, the DOTD has been widening the Interstate from four lanes to six lanes to accommodate the increasing amount of traffic and make the section safer. The I-10/I-12/I-59 split, notorious for rough pavement, was repaved in 2015.

<doc id="86410" wikidata="Q677763" url="?curid=86410" title="C≈µn Annwn">
<text>In Welsh mythology and folklore, C≈µn Annwn (, &quot;hounds of Annwn&quot;), singular Ci Annwn (), were the spectral hounds of Annwn, the otherworld of Welsh myth. They were associated with a form of the Wild Hunt, presided over by either Arawn, king of Annwn in (Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed), the First Branch of the Mabinogi and alluded to in (Math, the son of Mathonwy) the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi, or by Gwyn ap Nudd as the underworld king and king of the fair(y) folk is named in later medieval lore.

In Wales, they were associated with migrating geese, supposedly because their honking in the night is reminiscent of barking dogs.

Hunting grounds for the C≈µn Annwn are said to include the mountain of Cadair Idris, where it is believed &quot;the howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them&quot;.

According to Welsh folklore, their growling is loudest when they are at a distance, and as they draw nearer, it grows softer and softer. Their coming is generally seen as a death portent.

== Owner ==
Arawn, king of Annwn, is believed to set the C≈µn Annwn loose to hunt mundane creatures. When Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed, saw the C≈µn Annwn take down a stag, he set his own pack of dogs to scare them away. Arawn then came to him and said that as repentance for driving away the C≈µn Annwn, Pwyll would have to defeat Hafgan.

Christians came to dub these mythical creatures as &quot;The Hounds of Hell&quot; or &quot;Dogs of Hell&quot; and theorised they were therefore owned by Satan. However, the Annwn of medieval Welsh tradition is an otherworldly place of plenty and eternal youth and not a place of punishment like the Christian concept of Hell.

The hounds are sometimes accompanied by a fearsome hag called Mallt-y-Nos, &quot;Matilda of the Night&quot;. An alternative name in Welsh folklore is C≈µn Mamau (&quot;Hounds of the Mothers&quot;).

Da Derga is also known to have a pack of nine white hounds, perhaps C≈µn Annwn.

Culhwch rode to King Arthur&#x27;s court with two &quot;Otherworld&quot; dogs accompanying him, possibly C≈µn Annwn.

== The Wild Hunt ==
The C≈µn Annwn are associated with the Wild Hunt. They are supposed to hunt on specific nights (the eves of St. John, St. Martin, Saint Michael the Archangel, All Saints, Christmas, New Year, Saint Agnes, Saint David, and Good Friday), or just in the autumn and winter. Some say Arawn only hunts from Christmas to Twelfth Night. The C≈µn Annwn also came to be regarded as the escorts of souls on their journey to the Otherworld.

A Ci Annwn&#x27;s goal in the Wild Hunt is to hunt wrongdoers into the ground until they can run no longer, just as the criminals did to their victims.

== Colouring and meaning ==
The C≈µn Annwn are associated with death, as they have red ears. The Celts associated the colour red with death. White is associated with the supernatural, and white animals are commonly owned by gods or other inhabitants of the Otherworld.

== Similar creatures ==
In other traditions similar spectral hounds are found, e.g. Gabriel Hounds (England), Ratchets (England), Yell Hounds (Isle of Man), related to Herne the Hunter&#x27;s hounds, which form part of the Wild Hunt. Similar hounds occur in Devon ‚Äì particularly on Dartmoor ‚Äì and Cornwall but it is not clear whether they stem from Brythonic or Saxon origins.

<text>Carcassonne is a French fortified city in the department of Aude, region of Occitania. It is the prefecture of the department.

Inhabited since the Neolithic Period, Carcassonne is located in the plain of the Aude between historic trade routes, linking the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea and the Massif Central to the Pyr√©n√©es. Its strategic importance was quickly recognised by the Romans, who occupied its hilltop until the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In the fifth century, the region of Septimania was taken over by the Visigoths, who founded the city of Carcassonne in the newly established Visigothic Kingdom.

Its citadel, known as the Cit√© de Carcassonne, is a medieval fortress dating back to the Gallo-Roman period and restored by the theorist and architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc between 1853 and 1879. It was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997 because of the exceptional preservation and restoration of the medieval citadel. Consequently, Carcassonne relies heavily on tourism but also counts manufacturing and winemaking as some of its other key economic sectors.

== Geography ==
Carcassonne is located in the south of France about east of Toulouse. Its strategic location between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea has been known since the Neolithic era. The town&#x27;s area is about , which is significantly larger than the numerous small towns in the department of Aude. The rivers Aude, Fresquel, and the Canal du Midi flow through the town.

== History ==
The first signs of settlement in this region have been dated to about 3500 BC, but the hill site of &quot;Carsac&quot;‚Äîa Celtic place-name that has been retained at other sites in the south‚Äîbecame an important trading place in the sixth century BC. The Volcae Tectosages fortified it and made it into an &quot;oppidum&quot;, a hill fort, which is when it was named &quot;Carsac&quot;.

The folk etymology‚Äîinvolving a ch√¢telaine named Lady Carcas, a ruse ending a siege, and the joyous ringing of bells (&quot; sona&quot;)‚Äîthough memorialized in a neo-Gothic sculpture of &quot;Mme. &quot; on a column near the Narbonne Gate, is of modern invention. The name can be derived as an augmentative of the name Carcas.
Carcassonne became strategically identified when the Romans fortified the hilltop around 100 BC and eventually made it the of &quot;Julia Carsaco&quot;, later &quot;Carcaso&quot;, later &quot;Carcasum&quot; (by the process of swapping consonants known as metathesis). The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo-Roman times. In A.D. 462 the Romans officially ceded Septimania to the Visigothic king Theodoric II who had held Carcassonne since A.D. 453. He built more fortifications at Carcassonne, which was a frontier post on the northern marches. Traces of them still stand.

Theodoric is thought to have begun the predecessor of the basilica that is now dedicated to Saint Nazaire. In A.D. 508 the Visigoths successfully foiled attacks by the Frankish king Clovis I. In Francia, the Arab and Berber Muslim forces invaded the region of Septimania in A.D. 719 and deposed the local Visigothic Kingdom in A.D. 720; after the Frankish conquest of Narbonne in 759, the Muslim Arabs and Berbers were defeated by the Christian Franks and retreated to Andalusia after 40 years of occupation, and the Carolingian king Pepin the Short came up reinforced.

A medieval fiefdom, the county of Carcassonne, controlled the city and its environs. It was often united with the county of Raz√®s. The origins of Carcassonne as a county probably lie in local representatives of the Visigoths, but the first count known by name is Bello of the time of Charlemagne. Bello founded a dynasty, the Bellonids, which would rule many &quot;honores&quot; in Septimania and Catalonia for three centuries. In 1067, Carcassonne became the property of Raimond-Bernard Trencavel, viscount of Albi and N√Æmes, through his marriage with Ermengard, sister of the last count of Carcassonne. In the following centuries, the Trencavel family allied in succession with either the counts of Barcelona or of Toulouse. They built the &quot;Ch√¢teau Comtal&quot; and the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus. In 1096, Pope Urban II blessed the foundation stones of the new cathedral.

Carcassonne became famous for its role in the Albigensian Crusades when the city was a stronghold of Occitan Cathars. In August 1209 the crusading army of the Papal Legate, abbot Arnaud Amalric, forced its citizens to surrender. Viscount Raymond-Roger de Trencavel was imprisoned while negotiating his city&#x27;s surrender and died in mysterious circumstances three months later in his dungeon. The people of Carcassonne were allowed to leave‚Äîin effect, expelled from their city with nothing more than the shirts on their backs. Simon de Montfort was appointed the new viscount and added to the fortifications.
In 1240, Trencavel&#x27;s son tried unsuccessfully to reconquer his old domain. The city submitted to the rule of the kingdom of France in 1247. Carcassonne became a border fortress between France and the Crown of Aragon under the 1258 Treaty of Corbeil. King Louis IX founded the new part of the town across the river. He and his successor Philip III built the outer ramparts. Contemporary opinion still considered the fortress impregnable. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Edward the Black Prince failed to take the city in 1355, although his troops destroyed the lower town.

In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees transferred the border province of Roussillon to France, and Carcassonne&#x27;s military significance was reduced. Its fortifications were abandoned and the city became mainly an economic center of the woollen textile industry, for which a 1723 source quoted by Fernand Braudel found it &quot;the manufacturing center of Languedoc&quot;. It remained so until the Ottoman market collapsed at the end of the eighteenth century, then reverted to a country town.

== Historical importance ==
Carcassonne was the first fortress to use hoardings in times of siege. Temporary wooden platforms and walls would be fitted to the upper walls of the fortress through square holes in the face of the wall, providing protection to defenders on the wall and allowing defenders to go out past the wall to drop projectiles on attackers at the wall beneath.

== Main sights ==

=== The fortified city ===

The fortified city consists essentially of a concentric design of two outer walls with 53 towers and barbicans to prevent attack by siege engines. The castle itself possesses its own drawbridge and ditch leading to a central keep. The walls consist of towers built over quite a long period. One section is Roman and is notably different from the medieval walls, with the tell-tale red brick layers and the shallow pitch terracotta tile roofs. One of these towers housed the Catholic Inquisition in the 13th century and is still known as &quot;The Inquisition Tower&quot;.

Carcassonne was demilitarised under Napoleon Bonaparte and the Restoration, and the fortified &quot;cit√©&quot; of Carcassonne fell into such disrepair that the French government decided that it should be demolished. A decree to that effect that was made official in 1849 caused an uproar. The antiquary and mayor of Carcassonne, Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille, and the writer Prosper M√©rim√©e, the first inspector of ancient monuments, led a campaign to preserve the fortress as a historical monument. Later in the year the architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, already at work restoring the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus, was commissioned to renovate the place.

In 1853, work began with the west and southwest walls, followed by the towers of the &quot;porte Narbonnaise&quot; and the principal entrance to the &quot;cit√©&quot;. The fortifications were consolidated here and there, but the chief attention was paid to restoring the roofing of the towers and the ramparts, where Viollet-le-Duc ordered the destruction of structures that had encroached against the walls, some of them of considerable age. Viollet-le-Duc left copious notes and drawings upon his death in 1879 when his pupil Paul Boeswillwald and, later, the architect Nodet continued the rehabilitation of Carcassonne.

The restoration was strongly criticized during Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s lifetime. Fresh from work in the north of France, he made the error of using slate (when there was no slate to be quarried around) instead of terracotta tiles. The slate roofs were claimed to be more typical of northern France, as was the addition of the pointed tips to the roofs.

=== Lower town ===

The ville basse dates to the Late Middle Ages. Founded as a settlement of the expelled inhabitants of the town sometime after the crusades, it has been the economic heart of the city for centuries. Though once walled, most of the walls in this portion of the town are no longer intact. The Carcassonne Cathedral is in this part of the town.

=== Other ===
Another bridge, Pont Marengo, crosses the Canal du Midi and provides access to the railway station. The Lac de la Cavay√®re has been created as a recreational lake; it is about five minutes from the city centre by automobile.

Further sights include:
* The Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus
* The Carcassonne Cathedral
* Church of St. Vincent

== Climate ==
Carcassonne has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfa), though with noticeable hot-summer mediterranean climate influence (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa), a climate which is more typical of southern France, with moderately wet and mild winters coupled with summers averaging above during daytime with low rainfall.

Carcassonne, along with the French Mediterranean coastline, can be subject to intense thunderstorms and torrential rains in late summer and early autumn. The Carcassonne region can be flooded in such events, the last of which happened on 14‚Äì15 October 2018.

==Population==

== Economy ==
The newer part (&quot;Ville Basse&quot;) of the city on the other side of the Aude river (which dates back to the Middle Ages, after the crusades) manufactures shoes, rubber and textiles. It is also the center of a major AOC winegrowing region. A major part of its income comes from the tourism connected to the fortifications (&quot;Cit√©&quot;) and from boats cruising on the Canal du Midi. Carcassonne is also home to the MKE Performing Arts Academy. Carcassonne receives about three million visitors annually.
=== Transport ===
In the late 1990s, Carcassonne airport started taking budget flights to and from European airports and by 2009 had regular flight connections with Porto, Bournemouth, Cork, Dublin, Frankfurt-Hahn, London-Stansted, Liverpool, East Midlands, Glasgow-Prestwick and Charleroi.

The Gare de Carcassonne railway station offers direct connections to Toulouse, Narbonne, Perpignan, Paris, Marseille, and several regional destinations. The A61 motorway connects Carcassonne with Toulouse and Narbonne.

== Education ==
*√âcole nationale de l&#x27;aviation civile

== Language ==
French is spoken. Historically, the language spoken in Carcassonne and throughout Languedoc-Roussillon was not French but Occitan.

== Sport ==
In July 2021, Carcassonne was the finish city for stage 13, and the starting point of stage 14, of the 2021 Tour de France. It was at the finish in Carcassonne that Mark Cavendish tied the record for most Tour de France stage wins (34) held by Eddy Merckx. Carcassonne was the finish city for stage 15, and the starting point of stage 16, of the 2018 Tour de France. Previously it was the starting point for stage 11 of the 2016 Tour de France, the starting point for a stage in the 2004 Tour de France, and a stage finish in the 2006 Tour de France.

As in the rest of the southwest of France, rugby union is popular in Carcassonne. The city is represented by Union Sportive Carcassonnaise, known locally simply as USC. The club has a proud history, having played in the French Championship Final in 1925, and currently competes in Pro D2, the second tier of French rugby.

Rugby league is also played, by the AS Carcassonne club. They are involved in the Elite One Championship. Puig Aubert is the most notable rugby league player to come from the Carcassonne club. There is a bronze statue of him outside the Stade Albert Domec at which the city&#x27;s teams in both codes play.

== Arts ==
In May 2018, as the project &quot;Concentric, eccentric&quot; by French-Swiss artist Felice Varini, large yellow concentric circles were mounted on the monument as part of the 7th edition of &quot;IN SITU, Heritage and contemporary art&quot;, a summer event in the Occitanie / Pyrenees-Mediterranean region focusing on the relationship between modern art and architectural heritage. This monumental work was done to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Carcassonne&#x27;s inscription on the World Heritage List of UNESCO.

Exceptional in its size and its visibility and use of architectural space, the exhibit extended across the western front of the fortifications of the city. The work could be fully perceived only in front of the Porte d&#x27;Aude at the pedestrian route from the Bastide. The circles of yellow colour consist of thin, painted aluminium sheets, spread like waves of time and space, fragmenting and recomposing the geometry of the circles on the towers and curtain walls of the fortifications. The work was visible from May to September 2018 only.

== In culture ==
* The French poet Gustave Nadaud made Carcassonne famous as a city. He wrote a poem about a man who dreamed of seeing but could not see before he died. His poem inspired many others and was translated into English several times. Georges Brassens has sung a musical version of the poem. Lord Dunsany wrote a short story (in &quot;A Dreamer&#x27;s Tales&quot;) as did William Faulkner.
*On 6 March 2000 France issued a stamp commemorating the fortress of Carcassonne.
*In 2000, the popular board game Carcassonne (board game) was released. While exploring the area for inspiration, the creator, Klaus-J√ºrgen Wrede, &quot;was so impressed by the whole landscape and area surrounding Carcassonne&quot; that he &quot;wanted to build it in a game&quot;.
*It was the inspiration for the Black Ops 6 Zombie Map &quot;Citadelle des Morts&quot; (Citadel of the Dead).
*It was the titular destination in the book &quot;Narrow Dog to Carcassonne&quot; journalling a couple&#x27;s trip from England to the Mediterranean coast of France aboard their narrowboat.

<text>Barenaked Ladies (BNL) are a Canadian rock band formed in 1988 in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario. The band developed a following in Canada, with their self-titled 1991 cassette becoming the first independent release to be certified gold in Canada. They reached mainstream success in Canada when their debut with Reprise Records, &quot;Gordon&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot; and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;, was released in 1992. The band&#x27;s popularity subsequently spread into the US, beginning with versions of &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; and &quot;The Old Apartment&quot; off their 1996 live album &quot;Rock Spectacle&quot;, followed by their fourth studio album &quot;Stunt&quot;, their breakout success in 1998. The album featured their highest-charting hit, &quot;One Week&quot;, as well as &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Done&quot; and &quot;Call and Answer&quot;. Their fifth album, &quot;Maroon&quot;, featuring the lead single &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, also charted highly. The band is also recognized for creating and performing the theme song to the American sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

Initially a duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page, the band quickly grew to a quintet, adding brothers Jim and Andy Creeggan and Tyler Stewart by 1990. Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995 and was replaced by Kevin Hearn. Page left in 2009, reducing the group to a quartet.

The band&#x27;s style has evolved throughout their career, and their music, which began as exclusively acoustic, quickly grew to encompass a mixture of pop, rock and folk. The band&#x27;s live performances feature comedic banter and freestyle rapping between songs. They have won multiple Juno Awards and have been nominated for two Grammy Awards. The group has sold over 15 million albums and singles and were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in March 2018.

==History==
===Origins (1988‚Äì1991)===
Barenaked Ladies began as the duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page. Both attended Churchill Heights Public School and connected after a Peter Gabriel concert and were both counsellors at Interprovincial Music Camp located in McKellar, Ontario. Page was impressed by Robertson&#x27;s ability to harmonize when they began playing songs together. While attending a Bob Dylan concert at Exhibition Stadium they decided upon the name &quot;Barenaked Ladies.&quot;
They first performed a largely improvised set during a battle of the bands at Nathan Phillips Square for the Second Harvest food bank on 1 October 1988. They continued with opening for The Razorbacksand others, while developing their improvised set to include comedy, songs, and audeince interactions.
Page and Robertson continued performing and began writing songs together. The band&#x27;s first tape, &quot;Buck Naked&quot; (1989), was made using a four-track recorder in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group Corky and the Juice Pigs, to whom they give credit for exposing them to the idea of comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour. One night in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited friends from music camp, brothers Andy Creeggan (percussion) and Jim Creeggan (bass), to play with them at a Christmastime club show. Featuring the two new band members, &quot;Barenaked Lunch&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Pink Tape&quot;) was released in 1990 despite being mastered incorrectly and playing too fast.
After six months, Andy Creeggan went on a student exchange trip to South America, leaving the band without a percussionist. While playing at a buskers&#x27; festival in Waterloo, Ontario in the summer of 1990, they met drummer Tyler Stewart, and he took over the position. During Andy Creeggan&#x27;s travels, the band gained attention, winning the 1990 YTV Achievement Award for Best Band/Musical Group. and by squeezing into a small &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Corner&quot; video booth in Toronto to perform &quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot;. The popular clip noticeably increased the band&#x27;s fanbase. Andy Creeggan returned in early 1991 to find that Stewart had taken over the role of percussionist. Causing him some concern, Creeggan began playing keyboards more, though he still performed on some songs with congas and other percussion. The band would soon embark upon their first full Canadian tour.

===Early Canadian success (1991‚Äì1992)===
The full band&#x27;s first commercial release was 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;. A demo tape originally created for the band&#x27;s performance at South by Southwest, it was the first recording to feature all five members and cost them $2,000‚Äì$3,000. They sent copies to all the labels in Canada; all of them refused. As they began selling more and more copies off the stage, through word of mouth people began asking for the tape in local stores. When retailers began asking the band for more tapes, the demo became a commercial release. Sales began to snowball based merely on word of mouth and their live shows. Page&#x27;s father, Victor, created the independent label Page Publications to handle the cassette&#x27;s manufacturing and distribution. (After the band signed to a major label, Page Publications remained in operation, later releasing albums by artists such as The Lowest of the Low, Leslie Spit Treeo, Annette Ducharme, David Gogo, and Bodega.)

During this era, the band garnered radio airplay with a live cover of Dean Friedman&#x27;s &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Girl&quot;, which included a rap break incorporating lyrics from Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Hey Ladies&quot;. Another major break for the band came in November 1991 when Barenaked Ladies contributed a cover of Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;Lovers in a Dangerous Time&quot; to the Cockburn tribute album &quot;Kick at the Darkness&quot;. The song became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in Canada.
Sales of &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot; were jump-started when the band was removed from the lineup of the 1991 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands believed the band&#x27;s name objectified women; the decision was affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The group shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media picked up the story and presented it as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall&#x27;s decision as the story became increasingly prominent. A week after New Year&#x27;s, the band was asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for the front page of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. The newer stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved with removing the band from the concert and was out of town when the decision was made. The following week, sales of the &quot;Yellow Tape&quot; exploded ‚Äî by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot;, Genesis&#x27; &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;, and U2&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever &quot;Intimate and Interactive&quot; special on 17 January. The tape eventually became the first-ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.

By the end of February, Toronto City Council revised its rules for event bookings at Nathan Phillips Square in the hopes of avoiding another similar controversy. The City Hall story has followed the band ever since; Robertson credits the scale of the story to it being a slow news week.

===First albums (1992‚Äì1997)===

The band was signed to Sire Records in April 1992 after a long period of being rejected by every label they approached.

On May 30, 1992, the band performed at Ontario Place Forum in Toronto, becoming the quickest act to ever sell out the venue.

The band&#x27;s first full album, &quot;Gordon&quot;, was released in July 1992 and was a big success in Canada; by the end of August, it had already been certified platinum. It included some of the band&#x27;s most well-known songs, including &quot;Enid&quot;, the first single; &quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot;, the single which helped fund the album; &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;, which spawned a tradition of throwing Kraft Dinner during live shows, which the band later discouraged; and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;, named after Beach Boy Brian Wilson (who later covered the song on a live album). &quot;Gordon&quot; benefited from a number of its songs (including the latter three) being live favourites and had been recorded for past releases like &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;. Although the band was doing remarkably well in Canada, they found it translated into little success in the US.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Maybe You Should Drive&quot; (1994), was much less popular with the Canadian public. Their tour of the US was deemed a failure and lost money despite an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Before the next release, Andy Creeggan decided to leave the band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band and was not comfortable with their new fame. According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the &quot;Drive&quot; album; the rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album and for the subsequent touring. Also, Creeggan wanted to attend McGill University to study music further. Tyler Stewart has also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as a percussionist. Andy Creeggan&#x27;s departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of one other, with Page and Robertson rarely communicating. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with alcohol abuse and depression. In an attempt to correct the band&#x27;s downward slide, they signed with Terry McBride and Nettwerk as their management.

The band released &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; as a quartet in 1996. The album received two large boosts from the inclusion of the song &quot;Shoe Box&quot; on the &quot;Friends&quot; soundtrack and from the Jason Priestley-directed video for &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, which got notable U.S. airplay and while the album had stronger sales than &quot;Maybe You Should Drive&quot;, it still did not match the success of &quot;Gordon&quot;. The group appeared as the guest band on an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (&quot;Spring Breakdown&quot; original airdate: 2 April 1997), immediately preceding their 1997 tour; they performed &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;Life, In A Nutshell&quot;, and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; at the Peach Pit After Dark night club. Tyler Stewart invited his friend Kevin Hearn to replace Andy Creeggan as a keyboardist for the tour, ultimately joining the band full-time. The group also had a cameo in the Canadian film &quot;The Wrong Guy&quot; with Dave Foley in 1997. They performed the song &quot;Gangster Girl&quot; as police officers in an alley on their break.

From two dates on the &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; tour during 1996, Barenaked Ladies recorded and released a live album called &quot;Rock Spectacle&quot;, which had a modest American radio hit with &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;. The album became the band&#x27;s first gold record in the United States, and the success of &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; and &quot;The Old Apartment&quot; led to a new situation for the band. They knew their next album would be their chance to make it big in the States.

===Breakthrough success in the United States (1998‚Äì2004)===
&quot;Stunt&quot; (1998) became their greatest mainstream success, buoyed by the single &quot;One Week&quot;, which spent‚Äîcoincidentally‚Äîone week at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Stunt&quot; reached No. 3 in the US &quot; Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 9 in Canada. Kevin Hearn was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after the album was released, eventually receiving bone marrow transplants from his brother and missing most of the &quot;Stunt&quot; tour.
The band toured, with friends Chris Brown and Greg Kurstin both filling in on keyboards until Hearn recovered enough to rejoin them on tour. The singles &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Done&quot; (used as the opening theme song on the short-lived animated television series &quot;Baby Blues&quot;) and &quot;Call and Answer&quot; (which later appeared in the film &quot;EdTV&quot;) were also modest hits. The band was asked to contribute a song (&quot;Get in Line&quot;) to the soundtrack of the Fox cartoon &quot;King of the Hill.&quot; Barenaked Ladies also had a guest appearance in a 1999 episode of &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;.

Led by the &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single, in the US &quot;Maroon&quot; (2000) did not perform as well as &quot;Stunt&quot; had, reaching only No. 5 on the Billboard Top 100, however, it topped the Canadian charts. In 2001, they released a compilation album entitled &quot;Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991‚Äì2001)&quot;, referencing a line from &quot;Box Set&quot;. It contained 15 singles from previous albums, two singles from other compilations, and two new tracks (dubbed &quot;our new greatest hits&quot; by Robertson during the subsequent tour).

After finishing a tour on 31 December 2001 in Rosemont, Illinois to promote the compilation, the band decided to take a year off, occasionally playing shows such as the Medals Plaza at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City before returning to the studio in April 2003.

&quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; was released on 21 October 2003, coinciding with the first show of the unique Peep Show tour. The first single off the album was &quot;Another Postcard (Chimps)&quot;, which received modest radio play. &quot;Testing 1,2,3&quot; was the second single from the album and received a video, but no CD single, while &quot;Celebrity&quot; was released later in the UK with a CD single, but no video. &quot;Maybe Katie&quot; (and an edited version of &quot;For You&quot; from a concert in Glasgow) were also released as singles to radio. The album was their weakest seller in years and had a short chart life. The release fulfilled their contract with Reprise Records, and they did not re-sign. This made the group independent for the first time since 1992 (though they retained a distribution relationship with Warner Bros. Records). On the subsequent Everywhere For Everyone tour, in early 2004, the band began offering their full live shows for purchase as a download or CD-R via their website, as well as subsequent studio releases.

The band recorded the theme song for the 2000 children&#x27;s program &quot;Seven Little Monsters&quot;. They also appeared in &quot;The Honeymoon&#x27;s Over&quot;, the premiere of &quot;Charmed&quot;‚Ä≥s third season, performing &quot;Pinch Me&quot; onstage at the fictional night club P3. In 2003 they recorded the theme song for &quot;Odd Job Jack&quot;.

===Return to independence (2004‚Äì2008)===

The band&#x27;s next album was &quot;Barenaked for the Holidays&quot;, released on 5 October 2004. It was their first independent record since &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;, as well the first album recorded at Page&#x27;s recently-completed farmhouse studio, Fresh Baked Woods. The band created the record label Desperation Records for this album.

In January 2005, the band taped a television pilot for a variety show, tentatively titled &quot;Barenaked Ladies Variety Show&quot;, which was ultimately rejected by the Fox network. Later that year, the band was asked to write music for the Stratford Festival of Canada&#x27;s musical production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Page wrote most of the music (Shakespeare had provided lyrics in the play), and the band recorded it for the actors to sing over. The recording (with Page&#x27;s vocals) was available on CD from the festival as well as the band&#x27;s website. On 2 July they participated in the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario. Following several writing sessions throughout 2005, that fall the band entered the studio at Fresh Baked Woods to begin recording 29 songs. They broke from the studio in November and December to play a 22-show holiday tour, playing one of their new songs each night. An iTunes Originals¬†‚Äì a collection of interviews and live songs (coupled with some old album tracks) was recorded while the band was in the studio. It was released in February 2006, when the band went back into the studio to finish up the recordings they started the previous fall. Initially unsure how to release so many songs, the band decided to release a single-disc album in early September entitled &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot;. Several alternate versions are available, including downloadable versions and a USB flash drive version. The B.L.A.M. tour in support of the album and its follow-up, &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Men&quot;, which hailed from the same sessions, ran in fall 2006 and briefly in June 2007 for the US, February 2007 for Canada, and later in 2007 for the UK. That same year the band wrote and recorded the theme song for the television series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.
On 6 May 2008, the band released &quot;Snacktime!&quot;, an album of original material aimed at children. The album features artwork by Hearn in its liner notes, which is also available in the form of a hardcover book with CD included. The album was promoted with a series of television and in-store appearances at bookstores in the US northeast, the West Coast, and Toronto.

Complications began in July 2008 when the band cancelled several appearances at several Disney Music Block Party concerts following Page&#x27;s arrest on allegations of cocaine possession. In August, Robertson crashed his single-engine plane (without casualty) and his mother died that December. Band members lamented how the events of the year marred their 20th anniversary festivities (1 October 2008).

===Departure of Page (2009‚Äì2011)===
On 24 February 2009, Barenaked Ladies and Steven Page separately announced that Page had left the band by &quot;mutual agreement.&quot; The remaining members continued as a quartet while Page pursued solo projects, including theatrical opportunities. In July, it was announced the band had left Nettwerk management and had hired the newly merged management firm CAM 8.

Robertson commented on the departure of one of the band&#x27;s founding members:

Barenaked Ladies entered the studio as a quartet in May 2009 to record a new album with producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda. &quot;You Run Away&quot;, the lead single from the new album, was released to Canadian radio on 8 January. &quot;All in Good Time&quot; was released 23 March 2010 in Canada and 30 March in the US. On 6 January 2010, the band announced that it had signed an exclusive worldwide distribution deal with EMI Label Services. The same announcement implied that following the departure of Page, the band has created a new label called Raisin&#x27; Records.

&quot;All in Good Time&quot; was generally well-received by critics. The band toured the U.S. and Canada during the summer of 2010, with an autumn leg in the United Kingdom. When asked about Page&#x27;s departure, Tyler Stewart said, &quot;We don&#x27;t keep in touch, but we certainly we wish him the best, and there&#x27;s good will there.&quot; In October 2010, Page stated that he has no plans to rejoin the band soon, other than a possible one-off performance. He added that it felt strange the group continued to use the same name and perform the songs that he wrote and performed.

Page commented in August 2011 that around the subsequent time of his arrest for cocaine possession, &quot;the band was no longer the joyous place that it once was, but it hadn&#x27;t been joyous for a long time before that. It wasn&#x27;t that we didn&#x27;t put on good shows, we still had a great time onstage every night,&quot; he added. &quot;But it became a place where work was just about the stress and not the end product.&quot;

In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Page sued Robertson over the &quot;Big Bang Theory Theme&quot; song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds but Robertson kept the money.

===Modern day (2011‚Äìpresent)===
The band released a second greatest-hits album, &quot;Hits from Yesterday &amp; the Day Before&quot;, through Rhino Entertainment (a division of their former parent label, Warner Music Group) on 27 September 2011. Another Rhino album, &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before&quot;, containing previously-recorded but unreleased rarities, was planned for release later in 2011 but was delayed until 8 May 2012.

Barenaked Ladies was commissioned to compose the original score for a musical based on &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. The project was announced in early 2012. However, by mid-2013, the band had been dropped from the production.

The band returned to the studio in May 2012 to record a single, &quot;Boomerang&quot;. The session was produced by Gavin Brown. The band indicated plans for &quot;Boomerang&quot; to be released as a single during the summer of 2012 in conjunction with their Last Summer On Earth tour on which the song was performed nightly. The single was also performed on the late 2012 Symphony Barenaked Tour but remained unreleased. The band had mentioned the possibility of abandoning the album concept and releasing only singles and EPs. However, the band went into the studio in February and March 2013 to work on a full album, which was released as &quot;Grinning Streak&quot; on 4 June 2013. The band then signed with Vanguard Records for the release, their first label album of originals since going independent following 2003&#x27;s &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;. &quot;Boomerang&quot; was added to the new album tracks and was released as a single on 26 March 2013. Two further singles were released: &quot;Odds Are&quot; in late 2013 and &quot;Did I Say That Out Loud?&quot; in mid-2014. Each of the latter singles had a music video produced by Rooster Teeth Productions.

Looking to maintain a high profile, the band began work on a new album in December 2014. The band&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;Silverball&quot;, was released on 2 June 2015, three days before the band kicked off its Last Summer on Earth 2015 tour with Violent Femmes and Colin Hay. The lead single, &quot;Say What You Want&quot;, was released on 28 April 2015. The music video for the next single, &quot;Duct Tape Heart&quot;, contained live footage of the band&#x27;s performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on the Last Summer On Earth 2015 tour, was released on 19 October 19 to coincide with the start of the Canadian leg of the Silverball tour.

Barenaked Ladies released their second live album, &quot;BNL Rocks Red Rocks&quot;, on 20 May 2016. It was recorded at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on the Last Summer on Earth 2015 tour. The band also held a Last Summer on Earth 2016 tour with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Howard Jones in conjunction with the new live album. &quot;BNL Rocks Red Rocks&quot; is the band&#x27;s first commercial live release since the departure of Page in 2009.

On 23‚Äì24 October 2016, the band recorded an album with New York City a cappella group, The Persuasions and producer Gavin Brown. The album, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen: Barenaked Ladies and The Persuasions&quot;, consisted of new versions of existing Barenaked Ladies songs (along with one Kevin Hearn song and one Persuasions song). It was released on 14 April 2017.

The band returned to the studio in the winter of 2017 to record their 12th studio album, &quot;Fake Nudes&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Up&quot;, along with &quot;Bringing It Home&quot;, were made available for download to those who pre-ordered the album. The album itself was released on 17 November 2017.

On 25 March 2018, the band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the Juno Awards in Vancouver. The band performed alongside former members Steven Page (who was included in the induction) and Andy Creeggan. This was Page&#x27;s first performance with the band since his departure in 2009. Despite his presence at the ceremony, Andy Creeggan was not inducted into the Hall with the other five members. Though there are reportedly no plans for another reunion, neither side has ruled it out.

In the summer of 2019, Barenaked Ladies took a break from their own Last Summer On Earth tours and opened for Hootie and the Blowfish on that band&#x27;s 44-date Group Therapy Tour. It was the band&#x27;s first tour as an opening act since the early 1990s.

On 4 October 2019, Rhino Records released a new greatest hits collection titled &quot;Original Hits, Original Stars&quot; exclusively on vinyl.

On 14 January 2020, Robertson stated he was working on songs for a new album, with a tour to follow supported by Gin Blossoms and Toad the Wet Sprocket. The tour was slated to begin on 3 June in St. Augustine, Florida and end on 23 July in Toronto but was delayed until 2021, and delayed again until 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conjunction with the original tour announcement, the band also launched the &quot;Barenaked Bytes&quot; mobile app, allowing fans to gain access to ticket pre-sales, VIP packages, news, and discounts on merchandise.

Starting 29 March 2020, the band began releasing a series of webcam-based performances that they have dubbed #SelfieCamJam on their YouTube channel in response to the need for isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Their 13th studio album, &quot;Detour de Force&quot;, was released on 16 July 2021, aided by the singles &quot;Flip&quot;, &quot;Good Life&quot; and &quot;New Disaster&quot;.

In September 2021, Robertson revealed that Barenaked Ladies were working on a &quot;secret project&quot; with Rush bassist Geddy Lee.

On September 15, 2023, the band released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;In Flight&quot;, which included the singles &quot;Lovin&#x27; Life&quot; and &quot;One Night&quot;. The album has received mixed reviews since its release.

==Musical style==
The music of Barenaked Ladies is primarily classified as alternative pop, with influences from folk and rock. The band is known for delivering witty lyrics on a platter of catchy melodies. They developed their style of comedy rock to suit audience demand in their early days of opening for college comedy troupes. The intellectual appeal of their lyrics has led to being labeled geek rock by Eric Weisbard and others.

==Innovation and technology==
Barenaked Ladies has often attempted to use new technologies to promote themselves and their music. They were among the early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an &quot;Interactive Press Kit&quot; on a 3.5-inch floppy disk for &quot;Maybe You Should Drive&quot; in 1994, which earned them a MuchMusic Video Award. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs (&quot;Be My Yoko Ono&quot; and &quot;Alternative Girlfriend&quot;) for inclusion on their greatest hits CD &quot;Disc One&quot; (though polling was nearly tied and both songs were included).

Beginning in April 2003, the band started a blog on its website to keep fans updated personally, coinciding with the band&#x27;s return to the studio for &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;. During a subsequent studio session for &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot;, Ed Robertson began a podcast in addition to the blog, which ran from February to August 2006 (with a series of four videos added in early 2007 with highlights from the band&#x27;s first cruise).

The band has adopted many of the current online social networking sites, including accounts on MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. The Twitter feed has been integrated into the band&#x27;s website, and it also typically announces new blog posts with a link. These accounts have been used for contests and to debut new tracks. Different band members have also had individual accounts on these sites at times.

Barenaked Ladies has sold recordings of almost all of its live concerts since early 2004. Initially, shows were sold on CD-R or as MP3 downloads. By the end of 2004, lossless FLAC files were also offered. Professionally printed copies of some concerts were later offered through some isolated record stores, and some shows have been added to the iTunes Music Stores and other digital retailers.

The band was praised for a unique use of USB flash drive technology. The group offered its 2004 &quot;Barenaked For the Holidays&quot; album on a customized flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks and photos and videos from the studio sessions for the album. The band used a 128 MB USB flash drive, limiting the bitrate of the music included. The group described the product as a test of the technology and the market for that technology. It subsequently released &quot;Are Me&quot; in the USB format as well (on a 256 MB flash drive). The band also incorporated the technology into its live music sales, offering fans a copy of concerts in MP3 format on a USB stick at the merchandise booth directly after the show.

In 2009 the band took part in an interactive documentary series, &quot;City Sonic&quot;. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, includes Tyler Stewart reflecting on his memories of the (now closed) Ultrasound Showbar. The films were accompanied by an iPhone application, which uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to unlock more videos when the user is close to the specific location.

In February 2013, Barenaked Ladies participated in what was billed as the &quot;first space-to-earth musical collaboration&quot; involving the band and Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut and commander of the International Space Station, along with the Wexford Gleeks, a Canadian student choir. The group, Hadfield, and the choir performed a song &quot;I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing)&quot; that was commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canadian Space Agency.

==Awards and nominations==

In 1993, Barenaked Ladies were nominated for their first four Juno Awards: Canadian Entertainer of the Year, Album of the year for &quot;Gordon&quot;, Single of the Year for &quot;Enid&quot;, and Group of the Year, which was their only win. The group was again nominated for Entertainer of the Year in 1994 and Group of the Year in 1995. Barenaked Ladies&#x27; first Grammy nomination came in 1999 for &quot;One Week&quot; in the Pop Performance by a Duo or Group category but lost to Brian Setzer&#x27;s &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot;. The song, and its album &quot;Stunt&quot;, brought the band three more Juno Awards that year, for Best Single, Best Pop Album, and Best Group. Robertson lost to Bryan Adams in the newly revived Best Songwriter Category. The video for &quot;One Week&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction, but lost to &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; by Lauryn Hill.

The band was nominated for their second Grammy in 2001 for &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, again in the Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group category, but lost to &quot;Cousin Dupree&quot; by Steely Dan. They also won three more Juno Awards for &quot;Maroon&quot; under Best Pop Album, Best Album, and Best Group, bringing their total to seven. &quot;Pinch Me&quot; was nominated for Best Single but lost to &quot;I&#x27;m Like a Bird&quot; by Nelly Furtado. Additionally, Page and Robertson were nominated in the Best Songwriter category in its year for &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot;, and &quot;Falling for the First Time&quot;.

Five more Juno nominations have followed, totalling 18 nominations for the band (in addition to the two songwriting nominations). In 2004 they were up for Pop Album of the Year for &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, as well as Group of the Year. In 2005, they were up for Music DVD of the Year for the documentary &quot;The Barenaked Truth&quot;. In 2006, they were again nominated for Group of the Year. They were nominated for a 2009 Juno for their children&#x27;s album &quot;Snacktime!&quot; and won.

==Beyond music==
===Biography===
Barenaked Ladies have an authorized biography, which was released in 2001, titled &quot;Public Stunts Private Stories&quot;, written by a friend of the band and fellow Scarborough native Paul Myers with input from the band. It is published in Canada by Madrigal Press. An updated version of the biography was released in 2003 in the US with a different cover, several corrections, and additional information about &quot;Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, which were released after the initial printing.

===Canadian Music Creators Coalition===
In May 2006, Barenaked Ladies, along with other prominent Canadian musicians, formed the Canadian Music Creators Coalition in response to plans by the Canadian government to revisit and update copyright laws. Steven Page has acted as a conduit between the CMCC and the press, urging the government to focus on the Canadian cultural scene. Page has said the formation of the CMCC was in response to what he believes is the wrong direction taken by the RIAA and the major labels, by suing fans for filesharing.

===Barenaked Planet===
The band has also become a proponent of environmentalism, following from Page&#x27;s passion for greening (he is himself a board member of WWF Canada). The group began bringing an &quot;eco-village&quot; organized by the Reverb organization on their 2004 Au Naturale tour. The band has since partnered with Reverb to form the &quot;Barenaked Planet&quot; project, which is the group&#x27;s label for their project to progressively &quot;green&quot; their touring. Efforts the band have made include ensuring backstage materials are recycled, using biodiesel in their tour vehicles (B20 as of December 2006), and offsetting carbon emissions with wind power. This includes both band-sponsored offsets for their own emissions, as well as having volunteers sell &quot;Barenaked Planet&quot; stickers to concertgoers with the money going to offset their drives to the venues.

===Ice cream===
Barenaked Ladies is the first Canadian band to receive their own ice cream flavour, &quot;If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours&quot;, following in the footsteps of other band-themed Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s flavours such as Cherry Garcia (Jerry Garcia), One Sweet Whirled and Magic Brownies (Dave Matthews Band) and Phish Food (Phish).

The ice cream consisted of &quot;chocolate and vanilla ice cream with chunks of chocolate-covered toffee, white chocolate, peanut butter cups and chocolate-covered almonds.&quot; Tyler Stewart described it as &quot;an amalgamation of flavours [...] kind of like the band in a lot of ways‚Äîa lot of different personalities, different ethnic groups, all represented and rolled into one.&quot;

===Artists Against Racism===
Barenaked Ladies are a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them in the past on awareness campaigns.

===WE Charity===

Barenaked Ladies have made several appearances during WE Day events, performing in front of thousands of teenagers, empowering the young students to get involved in their communities and to promote social activity through WE charity&#x27;s work.

===Rock CAN Rol===

Barenaked Ladies have supported hunger relief organization Rock Can Rol and together with their fans have helped to feed people in need.

==Side projects==
Tyler Stewart, Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, and Ed Robertson all have past or present side projects during their time off from Barenaked Ladies. Stewart was part of a short-lived trio called Don&#x27;t Talk Dance, which released a self-titled album in 1995 featuring Chris Brown (who later sat in for Hearn with Barenaked Ladies during his late-90s cancer treatment). The album was made for charity, and all profits went to Casey House, an AIDS charity in Canada. Stewart also plays occasionally with the rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo which he first joined in high school. The band reunited in the early 2010s and has since played occasional concerts

Jim Creeggan formed the alternative/jazz group The Brothers Creeggan, with brother and former Barenaked Ladies member Andy Creeggan, later joined by Ian McLauchlan (who died in 2009). The group (variously as a duo and a trio) recorded four albums between 1995 and 2002. The group stopped performing regularly in the mid-2000s and have only played together on rare occasions, such as for Barenaked Ladies&#x27; cruises. Andy Creeggan also has several solo albums, with the most recent one released in 2021.

Since 1995, Kevin Hearn has released four albums as the frontman of Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle and three others with solo billing (with members of Thin Buckle as well as other musicians backing him). Hearn&#x27;s albums feature a mix of alternative rock and jazz with many other eclectic influences. Hearn continues to perform in the Toronto area and occasionally tours with Thin Buckle. Hearn was also the musical director and keyboardist for Lou Reed&#x27;s band from the mid-2000s until Reed&#x27;s passing in October 2013. He has also released an album of love songs as &quot;The Cousins&quot; in 2004 with his cousin, comedian Harland Williams.

Robertson joined a supergroup called Yukon Kornelius in 2008 with Dave Matthews Band bass player Stefan Lessard, singer/guitarist Adam Gardner of Guster, and drummer Eric Fawcett of Spymob. To date, the band has played four shows, but they anticipate doing a short tour when work with their other bands permit. Special guests usually join Yukon Kornelius during their shows, including Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Carl Bell (formerly of Fuel), Tyler Stewart, and other members of the Dave Matthews Band. Robertson also hosted three seasons of the 2006 television program called &quot;Ed&#x27;s Up&quot; for OLN Canada in which he flew his own plane to various locations to experience and publicize a variety of interesting occupations.

Former member Steven Page had a side project called The Vanity Project. The first self-titled album was written mostly with long-time collaborator Stephen Duffy. In the wake of a band decision to try to keep songwriting amongst its then-five members, Page said that the project was an opportunity for him to write with non-Barenaked Ladies writers. He indicated that a future release might include other writers and not necessarily Duffy. However, Page did not record a second Vanity Project album before his departure from Barenaked Ladies and has released his post-Barenaked Ladies works in his own name. Page has also hosted a season of the reality television series &quot;The Illegal Eater&quot;, which features Page travelling to showcase food and drink experiences that are in some way taboo, illicit, or outright illegal.

Also, band members (both individually and together) have often collaborated with other artists, such as making guest appearances on their albums, performing live, or co-writing songs with them.

In February 2019 all four band members joined Canadian rock musician Kim Mitchell in recording a rework of Mitchell&#x27;s former band Max Webster song Diamonds Diamonds from their 1977 album &quot;High Class in Borrowed Shoes&quot;. A video of the collaboration was released on YouTube.

==Reception==
In December 2008, Paul McCartney was reportedly asked by a session musician which bands he enjoys in the current music scene. His response was Barenaked Ladies: &quot;Their harmonies are right on. They could outsing us any day of the week. I don&#x27;t think John and myself ever had the sort of range they do.&quot; McCartney added that he would not mind recording with the band in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, notable Ontarian musical historians Liam Coholan, Patrick Murphy, and Jon &quot;The Don&quot; Dilario acknowledge in their latest Canadian music history issue that &quot;BNL was one of the most impactful bands when it comes to discussing the development of Canadian society in the 21st century.&quot;

<text>Interstate¬†15 (I-15) is a major Interstate Highway in the Western United States, running through Southern California and the Intermountain West. I-15 begins near the Mexican border in San Diego County and stretches north to Alberta, Canada, passing through the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Montana. The Interstate serves the cities of San Diego, San Bernardino, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Idaho Falls, and Great Falls. It also passes close to the urban areas of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, California. The stretches of I-15 in Idaho, Utah, and Arizona have been designated as the &quot;Veterans Memorial Highway&quot;. The southern end is at a junction with I-8 and State Route¬†15 (SR¬†15) in San Diego, and the northern end is at a connection with Alberta Highway 4 at the Sweetgrass‚ÄìCoutts Border Crossing.

I-15 was built to connect the Inland Empire with San Diego in California, facilitate tourism access to Las Vegas, provide access to the Arizona Strip, interconnect all of the metropolitan statistical areas in Utah except for Logan, and provide freeway bypasses for Pocatello, Idaho Falls, and Great Falls. Since its creation, I-15 has served as a long-haul route for North American commerce. It is now officially chartered for this purpose: from the junction of I-11 in Las Vegas to the Canadian border, I-15 forms part of the CANAMEX Corridor, a High Priority Corridor, as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since the construction of I-15, California, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah have consistently ranked in the fastest-growing areas of the United States. As a result, the route of I-15 has substantially increased in population and commuter traffic.

This highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in San Diego, California, at I-8, although via SR¬†15, a southern extension of the freeway, the route connects to I-5 12.5 miles from the US/Mexico border in southern San Diego. The northern terminus is in Sweet Grass, Montana, at the Canada‚ÄìUS border, where it becomes Alberta Highway 4. It is long from San Diego to Sweet Grass.

===California===
North of its junction with SR¬†91 in Corona, the route roughly follows the former routes of State Route 31. North of Devore, the highway follows the approximate alignment of historic US Route¬†66 along with US¬†91 and US¬†395. US¬†395 breaks away at Hesperia and the route continues on a direct path to Barstow to the north. Meanwhile, the old alignments of US¬†91 and US¬†66 follow the Mojave River from Victorville to Barstow along the National Trails Highway. At that point, I-15 follows the old route of US¬†91 exclusively as US¬†66 turned east toward Needles. For many parts of the highway, high-voltage powerlines, such as Path 46 and Path 27, almost all originating from the Hoover Dam, follow the freeway. Many of these link distant power stations to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

The southern starting point of I-15 was in 1957 planned to be in San Bernardino, at the interchange with the San Bernardino Freeway (then US¬†70/US¬†99, now I-10). This was logical as I-15 was following the old alignment of the historic Route¬†66 which passed through San Bernardino. The segment was completed accordingly.

In 1964, legislation was later passed to extend the Interstate to San Diego. Instead of extending the existing freeway from the I-10 interchange south, however, the California Department of Transportation drew a new segment in Devore that &quot;branched&quot; off of the original alignment and bypassed San Bernardino altogether. This segment&#x27;s alignment is generally northeast to southwest for about . Then, in Rancho Cucamonga, its directional alignment shifts to north‚Äìsouth where it eventually meets with I-10 (about west of the original interchange in San Bernardino). The segment that had been built from Devore to San Bernardino was retained as an Interstate, but was renumbered as I-215. Note that during the construction of I-15&#x27;s present alignment, and for some time afterward, I-215 was numbered as I-15E, and its actual mileage would begin at I-10. I-15 runs for a total of in California.

===Nevada===
I-15 begins in Primm and continues through Las Vegas along the Las Vegas Strip corridor. Then, the Interstate crosses the border with Arizona in Mesquite. The Interstate in Nevada runs entirely in Clark County, for a distance of .

===Arizona===
I-15 passes through the northwestern corner of Arizona with a total length of . The stretch is separated from the rest of the state and has one major exit, at Beaver Dam/Littlefield, Arizona. It includes a spectacular section where the road twists between the narrow walls of the Virgin River Gorge.

===Utah===
I-15 continues through Utah for . It is the main north‚Äìsouth connection for the state. The highway approximately follows the old alignment of US¬†91 from St. George to Brigham City. The highway passes through the fast-growing Utah&#x27;s Dixie region in the southwestern part of the state, which includes St. George, Cedar City, and eventually most of the major cities and suburbs along the Wasatch Front, including Provo, Orem, Sandy, Salt Lake City, Layton, and Ogden. Near Cove Fort, I-70 begins its journey eastward across the country. The Interstate merges with I-80 for about from South Salt Lake to just west of Downtown Salt Lake City and also merges with I-84 from Ogden to Tremonton. Along nearly its entire length through the state, I-15 winds its way along the western edge of a nearly continuous range of mountains (the Wasatch Range in the northern half of the state). The only exceptions are north of Cove Fort and when it passes between Cedar City and St. George, known as the Black Ridge, a transition zone of drastic change in elevation and climate, an area where the eastern Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, and Mojave Desert converge.

===Idaho===
I-15 passes through Idaho for . I-15 crosses the Utah state line in Oneida County. The highway runs through Pocatello, Blackfoot, and Idaho Falls, intersecting with I-86. The last county in Idaho that I-15 passes through is Clark County. Finally, the Interstate reaches the Montana state line at Monida Pass.

===Montana===

I-15 continues onward through of Montana through the cities of Butte, Helena, and Great Falls, intersecting with I-90, I-115, and I-315. At Sweet Grass, I-15 terminates upon crossing the Canadian border into the province of Alberta; however, I-15 signage is present on Alberta Highway 4 southbound from Lethbridge to the Canadian border.

==History==
I-15 was constructed along the route of US¬†91. Once I-15 was relatively intact, US¬†91 was decommissioned, except for one part in Northern Utah¬†/ Southern Idaho where I-15 instead followed the route of former US¬†191.

I-15 originally had two suffixed routes. In California, I-15 had an eastern branch bypassing San Bernardino, which was designated I-15E. I-15E was renumbered and is now I-215. Present day routing of I-15 in California was originally given &quot;I-15W&quot; as its title while it was under construction (the original asphalt portions from Temescal Canyon to Ontario Avenue were dubbed I-15W on maps until 1974), but was never officially signed as such. In Idaho, I-15 had a western branch near Pocatello that connected I-15 and I-84 (then I-80N). This highway was designated I-15W. It is now the western I-86.

===Growth along route===
Since the construction of I-15, California, Nevada, and Utah have consistently ranked in the fastest-growing areas of the United States. As a result, the route of I-15 has substantially increased in population and commuter traffic has increased the traffic burden on the freeway. Current population estimates are that more than 75¬†percent of the population of Utah, 19¬†percent of the population of California, and more than 70¬†percent of the population of Nevada live in counties where I-15 is the primary Interstate Highway.

Similarly, in California, I-15 is seeing more commuter traffic due to the growth of the Mojave Desert communities of Hesperia, Victorville, and Barstow. In Utah, I-15 has been under near-constant construction in the Wasatch Front, and future plans released by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) indicate that this will continue in the north &quot;and&quot; the far south of the state as well, due to the extremely rapid growth of Washington County and surrounding areas. In like manner, Las Vegas in Nevada has seen growth along I-15, and in all of the states that it currently serves, it has recently been or is currently in the process of being widened. The portions in Arizona, Idaho and Montana have retained their rural, long-haul character. Although Arizona has also grown substantially since the construction of I-15, this highway serves only the isolated corner of northwestern Arizona.

Due to this rapid area growth, the I-15 corridor is the focus of several mass transit projects. The Las Vegas Monorail, &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail system, and TRAX light rail in Salt Lake City are mass transit lines loosely parallel to I-15 that are now in operation.

The Los Angeles‚ÄìLas Vegas corridor has long been proposed as a high-speed maglev train route to relieve highway congestion. Proposals from as early as the 1970s were succeeded by the California‚ÄìNevada Interstate Maglev project, which was studied from 2004 to 2010 but never realized. Amtrak ran a conventional passenger rail service between the two cities, named the &quot;Desert Wind&quot;, from 1979 to 1997. The Brightline West line, a conventional high-speed rail service under a private operator, broke ground in 2024 and is scheduled to commence in 2028 with service between Rancho Cucamonga and Las Vegas. It will use the median of I-15 for most of its route and reach speeds of up to .

== Future ==
The segment signed as SR¬†15 from I-5 to I-8 in San Diego is planned to be redesignated as part of I-15 once this segment is completely converted to Interstate standards, namely where the freeway&#x27;s interchange with SR¬†94 is concerned. The interchange currently has left-exits and blind merges, and is due to be updated with a widening of both SR¬†15 and SR¬†94. At that time, SR¬†15 is planned be resigned as part of I-15. The remaining portion of SR¬†15 conforms with Interstate standards.

<doc id="86431" wikidata="Q1158728" url="?curid=86431" title="Damona">
<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Damona was a goddess worshipped in Gaul as the consort of Apollo Borvo and of Apollo Moritasgus. 

== Name ==

The theonym &quot;Damona&quot; is a derivative of the Proto-Celtic stem &quot;*damo-&quot;, meaning &#x27;bull&#x27; or &#x27;deer&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;dam&quot; &#x27;bull, deer&#x27;; also *&quot;damato&quot;- &gt; Middle Welsh &quot;dafad&quot; &#x27;sheep&#x27;, Old Cornish &quot;dauat&quot; &#x27;ewe&#x27;), itself from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;dmh2o&quot;- (&#x27;the tamed one&#x27;). The Latin noun &quot;damma&quot;, which is the source of French &quot;daim&quot; (&#x27;roe&#x27;), is probably a loanword from Gaulish. The root &quot;*dmh2-&quot; is also presumably reflected in the British tribal name &quot;Demetae&quot;, interpreted as meaning &#x27;Tamers&#x27;.

== Cult ==

Damona and Bormana have been described as the patron deities of the hot springs at Bourbonne-les-Bains and Saint-Vulbas, respectively. Some seventeen inscriptions dedicated to Damona have been recovered, including nine from Bourbonne-les-Bains and four from Bourbon-Lancy, both spa towns in eastern France. In one inscription from Saintes, she has the epithet &quot;Matubergini&quot;.
== Inscriptions and dedications ==
There are several inscriptions relating to Damona, including two inscriptions in Bourbon-Lancy (CIL 13, 02805), discovered in 1792.

:C (aius) Iulius Eporedirigis f (ilius) Magnus / pro L (ucio) Iulio Caleno filio / Bormoni and Damonae / vot (um) sol (vit)

and (CIL 13, 02806), where Damona is also included in dedications to Borvo, (CIL 13, 02807) and (CIL 13, 02808):

:Borvoni and Damonae / T (itus) Severius Mo / destus [o] mnib (us) / h [o] n [orib (us)] and offi [ciis]
The other large site associated with Damona is Bourbonne-les-Bains, there are nine dedications to the goddess of the waters, including (CIL 13, 05911):

:Deo Apol / lini Borvoni / et Damonae / C (aius) Daminius / Ferox civis / Lingonus ex / voto

and (CIL 13, 05914):

:Borvoni / and Damon (ae) / Aemilia / Sex (ti) fil (ia) / M [3] S

with (CIL 13, 05921):

:Damonae Aug (ustae) / Claudia Mossia and C (aius) Iul (ius) Superstes fil (ius) / l (ocus) d (atus) ex d (ecreto) d (ecurionum) v (otum) s (olverunt) l ( ibentes) m (erito)

Damona also appears in dedications to Chassenay, associated with Albius and Alise-Sainte-Reine. An inscription was found bearing Damona&#x27;s name in Alesia in 1962, where she was worshipped with Apollo Moritasgus (CIL 13, 11233):

:Aug (usto) sacr (um) / deo Albio and Damonae Sex (tus) Mart (ius) / Cocillus ex iussu eius v (otum) s (olvit) l (ibens) m (erito)

and (CAG-21-01):

:Deo Apollini Moritasgo [and] / Damonae P (ublius) Pontius Apolli [naris]

Finally, there is an inscription in Rivi√®res.

<text>In Irish mythology, Dian C√©cht (; also known as &quot;Cainte&quot; or &quot;Canta&quot;) was the god of healing, the healer for the Tuatha D√© Danann, and son of the Dagda according to the &quot;Dindsenchas&quot;.

He was the father of Cu, Cethen and Cian. His other children were Miach, Airmed, √âtan the poet and Ochtriullach (Octriuil). Through Cian, he is also Lugh&#x27;s paternal grandfather.

== Etymology ==
The name Dian Cecht may be a combination of the Old Irish common words &quot;d√≠an&quot; &#x27;swift&#x27; and &quot;c√©cht&quot;, glossed as &#x27;power&#x27;, hence the literal meaning may be literally &quot;swift power&quot;. The refers to him as the &quot;god of power&quot;, with &quot;c√©cht&quot; glossed as &quot;power&quot; ().

In Old Irish, there is also the word &quot;c√©cht&quot; meaning &#x27;plough-beam&#x27; (or less accurately &#x27;ploughshare&#x27;), but this makes &quot;little sense in the light of his activities&quot;, and this lexical meaning is &quot;presumably not relevant&quot;.

Linguistic knowledge about regular sound changes in Celtic languages (McCone, 1996) and analysis of the University of Wales‚Äô Proto-Celtic lexicon and of Julius Pokorny‚Äôs &quot;Indogermanisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch&quot; permit &quot;*Deino-kwekwto-&quot; ‚Äòswift concoction‚Äô as a plausible Proto-Celtic reconstruction for this theonym, hence the original name of the deity may have signified &#x27;swift potion&#x27; or, by extrapolation even &#x27;He-who-is-Swift-with-Healing-Remedies&#x27;. However this suggestion is problematic since the root is not attested in Old Irish, but only in the Brythonic cousin languages.

==Genealogy==
Dian C√©cht is described as a son of the Dagda in the &quot;Dindsenchas&quot;. His children varied according to source.

Dian C√©cht had fours sons, Cu, Cethen, Cian (the father of Lugh), and Miach according to a tract in the &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; (&quot;Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn&quot;), although the same tract states that the fourth son, Miach the physician, was often not reckoned. Cu, Cethen and Cian were called the &quot;three sons of Caint√©&quot; in the late modern narrative &quot;Aided Chlainne Tuirenn&quot;. Dian C√©cht was grandfather to Lugh, since C√≠an son of D√≠an C√©cht is the father of Lugh, by Ethne daughter of Balor.

Dian C√©cht had yet another son, Octriuil, who was also a physician: D√≠an C√©cht&#x27;s two sons Octriuil () and M√≠ach, and his daughter Airmed chanted over the healing well named Sl√°ine (cf. ¬ß¬†Curative well below).

Dian C√©cht&#x27;s daughters were Airmed the she-leech (female physician) and √âtan the poet according to the aforementioned &quot;Book of Invasions&quot; tract.

==Curative well==
Dian C√©cht ministered to the injured by soaking them in &quot;Slainge&#x27;s Well&quot; () or rather the &quot;well of healing&quot; () when the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh (&quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot;) was fought.

The well was located at Achad Abla (&#x27;Field of the Apple Tree&#x27;), northwest of Magh Tuireadh (Moytura). He also ground medicinal herbs nearby on Lusmag &quot;Herb-plain&quot;, or else, he chanted spells over the well together with his two sons Miach and Octriuil and daughter Airmed.

Dian C√©cht, when questioned on his ability, boasted to be able mend anyone but those who have been decapitated (or whose brain or spinal cord have been severely damaged); this he presumably accomplished using the Tipra Sl√°√≠ne.

==Boiling of the River Barrow==
It was Dian Cecht who once saved Ireland, and was indirectly the cause of the name of the River Barrow. The Morr√≠g√∫, the Dagda&#x27;s fierce wife, had borne a son of such terrible aspect that the physician of the gods, foreseeing danger, counselled that he should be destroyed in his infancy.

When this was done, Dian Cecht opened the infant&#x27;s heart, and found within it three serpents, capable, when they grew to full size, of depopulating Ireland. He lost no time in destroying these serpents also, and burning them into ashes, to avoid the evil which even their dead bodies might do. More than this, he flung the ashes into the nearest river, for he feared that there might be danger even in them. So venomous were they that the river boiled up and slew every living creature in it, and therefore it has been called the River Barrow, the ‚ÄòBoiling‚Äô ever since.

According to the Metrical Dindsenchas:
&lt;poem&gt;
No motion it made
The ashes of Meichi the strongly smitten:
The stream made sodden and silent past recovery
The fell filth of the old serpent.

Three turns the serpent made;
It sought the soldier to consume him;
It would have wasted by its doing the kine;
The fell filth of the old serpent.

Therefore Diancecht slew it;
There rude reason for clean destroying it,
For preventing it from wasting
Worse than any wolf pack, from consuming utterly.

Known to me is the grave where he cast it,
A tomb without walls or roof-tree;
Its ashes, evil without loveliness or innocence
Found silent burial in noble Barrow.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This tale in the Dindsenchas indicates that the being slain by Diancecht was a serpent named Meichi. Elsewhere the figure named as the slayer of Meichi is Mac Cecht.

==Dian Cecht‚Äôs Envy==
Dian Cecht made King Nuada a silver arm which could move and function as a normal arm. Later his son, Miach, replaced the silver arm with an arm of flesh and blood, and Dian Cecht killed him out of professional envy.

Miach&#x27;s sister, Airmed, mourned over her brother&#x27;s grave. As her tears fell, all the healing herbs of the world grew from the grave. Airmed arranged and catalogued the herbs, but then Dian C√©cht again reacted with anger and jealousy and scattered the herbs, destroying his daughter&#x27;s work as well as his son&#x27;s. For this reason, it is said that no human now knows the healing properties of all the herbs.

== Additional appearances ==
In Tochmarc √âta√≠ne, Dian Cecht healed Mider after the latter lost an eye when struck with a twig of hazel.

In the St. Gall incantations, there is a spell that mentions Dian C√©cht:

I save the dead-alive. Against eructation, against spear-thong (amentum), against sudden tumour, against bleeding caused by iron, against... which fire burns, against... which a dog eats, ...that withers: three nuts that... three sinews that weave (?). I strike its disease, I vanquish blood...: let it not be a chronic tumour. Whole be that whereon it (Diancecht&#x27;s salve) goes. I put my trust in the salve which Diancecht left with his family that whole may be that whereon it goes.

This is laid always in thy palm full of water when washing, and thou puttest it into thy mouth, and thou insertest the two fingers that are next the little-finger into thy mouth, each of them apart.
Dian C√©cht&#x27;s harper and poet was named Corand. According to the Dindsenchas, Corand is implied to be the son of Dian Cecht and summoned a swine called Caelcheis from the Dagda&#x27;s harp, which the champions of Connacht chased to Magh Coraind.

An early Irish legal text on the law of illegal injury, &quot;Bretha D√©in Ch√©cht&quot; (&quot;Judgements of Dian C√©cht&quot;), is attributed to Dian C√©cht. A late-historical preface to the &quot;Senchas M√°r&quot; details the codification and Christianization of Irish law by Saint Patrick and his commissioners. Dian Cecht is explicitly listed as among the pre-Christian authors whose judgements were accepted because they did not contradict Christian teaching.

<text>In Irish mythology, Miach () was a son of Dian Cecht of the Tuatha D√© Danann. He replaced the silver arm his father made for Nuada with an arm of flesh and blood; Dian Cecht killed him out of jealousy for being able to do so when he himself could not. Dian Cecht killed him by chopping Miach&#x27;s head four times with his sword. The first strike only cut Miach&#x27;s skin and Miach healed it. The second blow broke Miach&#x27;s skull but Miach also healed that. The third cut grazed Miach&#x27;s brain yet Miach could even heal this. Dian Cecht&#x27;s fourth attack cut his son&#x27;s brain in half and finally killed Miach. This resulted in 365 herbs growing from his grave, which his sister Airmid arranged, but which their father scattered. In any case, however, Miach is later seen in the story continuing to heal the Tuatha D√© by his father&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s side, so apparently there were no hard feelings.

In &quot;The Fate of the Children of Tuireann&quot; Miach makes an appearance with his brother Oirmiach at the beginning of the story. In the story, they replace the missing eye of Nuada&#x27;s doorkeeper with the eye of a cat. Then they draw a devil out of Nuada&#x27;s blackened arm and kill it. Finally, they find a replacement arm for Nuada, and Oirmiach sets the arm while Miach retrieves herbs to complete the healing.

==Etymology==
Miach is often translated as &#x27;bushel&#x27;, but has a meaning of an agreed upon amount of grain; Irish law texts also use miach in reference to an amount of malted grain, and in Munster there is reference to a &quot;fleith in m√©ich&quot; or &#x27;Feast of Miach&#x27;.

==Significance==
Grandsons of the Dagda, Miach and his brother Oirmiach are hypothesized to be the vestiges of the Celtic Divine Twins. The alliterative names are a hallmark of twinning, indicating that the two brothers were in origin twins. They are the physicians of the Tuatha De Danann and upon arriving at Nuadu&#x27;s court are described as &quot;handsome, young, and of good stature;&quot; beauty is one of the signatures of twin gods of the third function. When Miach (or in alternative accounts both Miach and Oirmiach) is killed by his father Dian Cecht, 365 herbs grow from his grave - the same number of days in a solar year, which may signify totality. Finally, Miach&#x27;s healing of Nuadu&#x27;s arm takes thrice nine days or 27 days total - the same as a lunar month.

<text>World Athletics, formerly known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation and International Association of Athletics Federations and formerly abbreviated as the IAAF, is the international governing body for the sport of athletics, covering track and field, cross country running, road running, race walking, mountain running, and ultra running. Included in its charge is the standardization of rules and regulations for the sports, certification of athletic facilities, recognition and management of world records, and the organisation and sanctioning of athletics competitions, including the World Athletics Championships. The organisation&#x27;s president is Sebastian Coe of the United Kingdom, who was elected to the four-year position in 2015 and re-elected in 2019 for a second four-year term, and then again in 2023 for a third four-year term.

==History==
The process to found World Athletics began in Stockholm, Sweden, on 18 July 1912 soon after the completion of the 1912 Summer Olympics in that city. At that meeting, 27 representatives from 17 national federations agreed to meet at a congress in Berlin, Germany, the following year, overseen by Sigfrid Edstr√∂m who was to become the fledgling organisation&#x27;s first president. The 1913 congress formally completed the founding of what was then known as the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).

It was headquartered in Stockholm from 1912 to 1946, in London from 1946 to 1993, and thereafter moved to its current location in Monaco.

In 1926, the IAAF created a commission to regulate all ball games that were played by hand, including basketball and handball. Subsequently, the International Amateur Handball Federation was founded in 1928, and the International Basketball Federation was founded in 1932.

Beginning in 1982, the IAAF passed several amendments to its rules to allow athletes to receive compensation for participating in international competitions. However, the organization retained the word &quot;amateur&quot; in its name until its 2001 congress, at which it changed its name to the International Association of Athletics Federations. In June 2019 the organization chose to rebrand as &quot;World Athletics&quot;, with a rollout beginning after the 2019 World Championships in Doha.

Following repeated requests, World Athletics became the last body within the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations to make public its financial reports in 2020. It revealed the organisation had revenue of around US$200 million spread over a four-year Olympic cycle, with around a fifth of that revenue coming from Olympic broadcasting rights. The reports showed a deficit in each of the non-Olympic years of 2017 and 2018 of around US$20 million. It also showed heavy dependence on its partnership with Japanese marketing agency Dentsu, which made up half of 2018&#x27;s revenue. It also highlighted reserves of US$45 million at the end of 2018, which would allow the organisation to remain solvent in the face of delays to the 2020 Summer Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. World Athletics Day is celebrated on 7 May.

In 2022, World Athletics imposed sanctions against the Member Federations of Russia and Belarus because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and all athletes, support personnel, and officials from Russia and Belarus were excluded from all World Athletics Series events for the foreseeable future, and Russian athletes who had received ANA status for 2022 were excluded from World Athletics Series events for the foreseeable future. World Athletics Council also applied sanctions on the Belarus Athletic Federation, including banning its hosting of any international or European athletics events, representation at Congress or in decisions which require Congressional votes, involvement of its personnel in programs, and accreditation to attend any World Athletics Series events.

==Governance==

World Athletics is headed by a president. The World Athletics Council has a total of 26 elected members, comprising one president, four vice-presidents (one senior), the presidents of the six area associations, two members of the Athletes&#x27; Commission and 13 Council members. Each member of the Council is elected for a four-year period by the World Athletics Congress, a biennial gathering of athletics officials that consists of the Council, Honorary Members, and up to three delegates from each of the national member federations. Chairpersons and members of Committees, which manage specialist portfolios, are also elected by the Congress. There are four committees: the Cross Country Committee, the Race Walking Committee, the Technical Committee, and the Women&#x27;s Committee. A further three committees were launched in 2019: Development, Governance and Competitions. The governance structure is outlined in the World Athletics Constitution, which may be amended by the Congress.

The World Athletics Council appoints a chief executive officer (CEO), who is focused on improving the coverage of the sport and the organisation&#x27;s commercial interests. This role was created and merged with the General Secretary role that had existed previously. British former athlete and businessman Jon Ridgeon was appointed to the role in December 2018. Olivier Gers was the first person to officially hold the position in 2016, succeeding the interim CEO/General Secretary Jean Gracia.

In order to give active athletes a voice in the governance of the sport, World Athletics created the Athletes&#x27; Commission. Athletes are elected to the commission by other athletes, typically held at the Congress attached to the World Athletics Championships. The commission chairperson and one other athlete of the opposite sex are given voting rights on the Council. The last election was held in October 2019 at the 2019 World Athletics Championships.

Following doping and corruption issues, a Code of Ethics was agreed in 2013 and an Ethics Commission was appointed in 2014. The Council appoints the chairperson from the elected members, and in turn, the chairperson appoints a deputy chair. The Ethics Board&#x27;s scope was limited in 2017 with the creation of the independent Athletics Integrity Unit, headed by Australia&#x27;s Brett Clothier, to oversee ethical issues and complaints at arm&#x27;s length.

The International Athletics Foundation is a charity closely associated with World Athletics that engages in projects and programmes to develop the sport. Albert II, Prince of Monaco is the Honorary President and the role of IAF President is held by the World Athletics President. A World Athletics Heritage department was created in 2018 to maintain historic artifacts and display them through a physical gallery in Monaco, a virtual online gallery, and a traveling exhibition. The department also issues World Athletics Heritage Plaques to commemorate locations of historic interest to the sport.

==Rules and regulations==
===Age===
To allow athletes of different ages to compete against athletes of similar ability, several age categories are maintained. The open class of competition without age limit is defined as &quot;senior&quot;. For younger athletes, World Athletics organises events for under-20 athletes (athletes aged 18 or 19 years on 31 December of the year of the competition) as well as under-18 athletes (athletes aged 16 or 17 years on 31 December of the year of the competition), historically referred to as &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;youth&quot; age groups, respectively. Age-group competitions over the age of 35 are organised by World Masters Athletics and are divided into five-year groupings.

===Doping===
The organisation is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s World Anti-Doping Code and applies sanctions to athletes, coaches and other sportspeople who breach the code through doping or impeding any anti-doping actions. Doping is still a serious issue in world athletics due to the increased use of banned substances by athletes to improve their athletic performance. To address the problem, athletes participating in sports are required to sign the World Anti-Doping Agency code and are subjected to random urine or blood samples testing, leading to penalties like game suspension, or lifetime ban for violating code.

===Sex===

International level athletics competitions are mostly divided by sex and World Athletics applies eligibility rules for the women&#x27;s category. World Athletics has regulations for intersex and transgender athletes. The differences of sex development (DSD) regulations apply to athletes who are legally female or intersex and have certain physiology. DSD athletes who are legally female or intersex are subject to specific rules if they have XY male chromosomes, testes rather than ovaries, circulating testosterone in the typical male range (7.7 to 29.4 nmol/L), and are androgen-sensitive so that their bodies make use of that testosterone. World Athletics requires any such athlete to reduce their blood testosterone level to 5 nmol/L or lower for a six-month period before becoming eligible for international competition.

The rules have been challenged by affected athletes in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), though no athlete has done so successfully. In May 2019, CAS upheld the rules on the basis that discrimination against the minority of DSD athletes was proportional as a method of preserving access to the female category to a much larger majority of women without DSDs.

In 2023, World Athletics tightened their regulations further, excluding transgender women who have gone through male puberty from competing in the female category. The new regulations also reduced the testosterone limit for androgen-sensitive XY DSD athletes to 2.5 nmol/L and extended the limit to apply to all women&#x27;s events, where it had previously only applied to track events of distances between 400m and one mile. World Athletics president Sebastian Coe described this as &quot;decisive action to protect the female category in our sport&quot;.

==Certified Athletic Facilities==
World Athletics provides approval certificates to venues of athletic facilities: Class 1, Class 2 and Indoor. To receive certification, venues are required to submit measurement reports of their track and field facilities.

Class 1 venues are fully certified along with in-situ tests of the actual synthetic track surface, whilst Class 2 venues only ensures that the synthetic surface has a valid Product Certificate (from an accredited synthetic track surface manufacturer) and the facility conforms to the stringent requirements for accurate measurement contained in World Athletics Rules and Regulations.

==Competitions==
World Athletics organizes many major athletics competitions worldwide.

===World Athletics Series===


:‚Ä† Formerly IAAF World Championships in Athletics
:‚Ä° Known as the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships before 2023, except for in 2006 and 2007 when it was known as the IAAF World Road Running Championships, with a 20¬†km race in 2006
:‚Ä†‚Ä† Formerly IAAF World Junior Championships
:‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† Formerly IAAF World Race Walking Cup
:‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† Formerly IAAF World Cup

===One-day events===
World Athletics became involved in annual one-day meetings as the sport began to professionalise in the late 1970s. Between 1978 and 1982, World Athletics staged twelve Golden Events, all for men and principally in track running, which saw World Athletics offer prizes to encourage competition. Three years later in 1985, an annual track and field circuit was created in the form of the IAAF Grand Prix, which linked existing top-level one-day meetings with a season-ending IAAF Grand Prix Final for a selection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events. The IAAF World Cross Challenge followed in 1990 and began an annual series for cross country running. The track and field circuit was expanded in 1993 with the creation of the IAAF Grand Prix II level, and the IAAF Golden League in 1998. World Athletics began recognising annual indoor track meets via the IAAF Indoor Permit Meetings series in 1997, and in 1998 decathletes and heptathletes found seasonal support with the creation of the IAAF Combined Events Challenge. The World Cross Challenge was disbanded in 2000 and cross country reverted to a permit format via the IAAF Cross Country Permit Meetings. The IAAF Race Walking Challenge was initiated in 2003 to provide a seasonal calendar for racewalking.

World Athletics reformed its track and field circuit in 2003, with the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings series grouping five tiers of annual track and field competitions: the Golden League, IAAF Super Grand Prix, Grand Prix, Grand Prix II, and the IAAF World Athletics Final. The new final format was introduced with a new global performance ranking system for qualification and featured an increased programme of track and field events, mirroring the World Championships in Athletics programme bar the road events, combined events, relays, and the 10,000 metres. The final achieved gender parity in events in 2005, with the inclusion of a women&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase. The track and field circuit was rebranded as the IAAF World Athletics Tour in 2006, which removed the global rankings and the IAAF Grand Prix II (replaced with a level of meetings given permit status by continental governing bodies). With World Athletics having recognised the sport of mountain running in 2002, the annual WMRA World Cup meetings received official sanctioning in 2006, organised under World Mountain Running Association. The IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final was created in 2007 to serve as a seasonal final for the Race Walking Challenge. World Athletics designed a sanctioning process for the road running competitions in 2008, with races having to meet organisational requirements to achieve Gold or Silver status under the IAAF Road Race Label Events brand. This incorporated the World Marathon Majors (a privately run series for major marathons initiated in 2006) within the Gold Label category. Road running was the last sport governed by World Athletics to receive seasonal sanctioning.

The 2010 season saw several changes to World Athletics&#x27; one-day governance. The World Athletics Tour was made defunct and replaced with three separate series: the 14-meet Diamond League as the top level of track meetings, the IAAF World Challenge as a second tier of track meetings, and the IAAF Hammer Throw Challenge as the top level of hammer throwing contests (as hammer was not included in the Diamond League). The Road Race Label grouping was also expanded that year with the creation of a Bronze label status. The Race Walking Challenge Final was removed from the racewalking schedule after 2012, as the series focused on international championship performances. In 2016, the IAAF World Indoor Tour was introduced as a replacement of the Indoor Permit Meetings series.

The track and field circuit is due for further changes in 2020, including an increase in the number of Diamond League meetings, the reduction of Diamond League events from 32 to 24, reduction of the Diamond League television running time to 90 minutes, the creation of a one-day Diamond League final, and the relaunch of the World Challenge series as the World Athletics Continental Tour.

==Awards==
The organisation hosts the annual World Athletics Awards, formerly the World Athletics Gala until 2017, at the end of each year to recognise the achievements of athletes and other people involved in the sport. Members may also be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame as part of the ceremony. The following awards are given: 

*Male Athlete of the Year
*Female Athlete of the Year
*Male Rising Star Award
*Female Rising Star Award
*Coaching Achievement Award
*Distinguished Career Award
*Women&#x27;s Award
*President&#x27;s Award
*Athletics Photograph of the Year

Separately, the World Athletics Heritage Plaque award was launched in Dec 2018. The plaque is a location-based recognition that can be awarded in five different and broad overlapping categories: city, competition, legend, landmark, culture. Each year the World Athletics will periodically award plaques taking advantage of appropriate moments in the international athletics calendar to make those announcements.

==Doping controversy==

In 2015, a whistleblower leaked World Athletics&#x27; blood test records from major competitions. The records revealed that, between 2001 and 2012, athletes with suspicious drug test results won a third of the medals in endurance events at the Olympics and World Championships‚Äîa total of 146 medals including 55 golds‚Äîbut the World Athletics caught none of them. After reviewing the results, Robin Parisotto, a scientist and leading &quot;anti-doping&quot; expert, said, &quot;Never have I seen such an alarmingly abnormal set of blood values. So many athletes appear to have doped with impunity, and it is damning that the IAAF appears to have idly sat by and let this happen.&quot; Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said his organisation was &quot;very disturbed by these new allegations ... which will, once again, shake the foundation of clean athletes worldwide&quot;, and that its &quot;independent commission will investigate the claims&quot;.

Around the same time, the University of T√ºbingen in Germany claimed that World Athletics suppressed publication of a 2011 report in which &quot;[h]undreds of athletes&quot;, as many as a third of the world&#x27;s top athletes, &quot;admitted violating anti-doping rules&quot;.
On 1 November 2015, former World Athletics president Lamine Diack was arrested in France and is under investigation on suspicion of corruption and money laundering. Diack allegedly accepted &quot;$1.2 million from the Russian athletics federation to cover up the positive doping tests of at least six Russian athletes in 2011.&quot; The IOC provisionally suspended Diack, and he resigned his position as an IOC Honorary Member. In 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported that with his influence, Diack was able to install two of his sons and a friend into positions that exerted influence over the IAAF. The report says that Lamine Diack &quot;was responsible for organizing and enabling the conspiracy and corruption that took place in the IAAF.&quot; In 2018, Diack was handed an additional charge of &quot;breach of trust&quot; by French prosecutors. On 18 June 2020, the trial of Diack and five other people, including his son, concluded. Diack was sentenced to jail for four years, two of them suspended.

In November 2015, WADA published its report, which found &quot;systemic failures&quot; in the World Athletics had prevented an &quot;effective&quot; anti-doping programme and concluded that Russia should be banned from competing in international competitions because of its athletes&#x27; test results. The report continued that &quot;the World Athletics allowed the conduct to occur and must accept its responsibility&quot; and that &quot;corruption was embedded&quot; in the organization.

In January 2016, as a result of the doping scandal and WADA&#x27;s report, the World Athletics&#x27; biggest sponsor, Adidas, announced that it was ending its sponsorship deal with the World Athletics four years early. The BBC reported that as a result World Athletics would lose $33 million (¬£23 million) worth of revenue. The 11-year sponsorship deal with Adidas was due to run until 2019. World-record holding sprinter Michael Johnson described the scandal as more serious than that faced by FIFA.
In February 2016, Nestl√© announced that it was ending its World Athletics sponsorship.

In June 2016, following a meeting of the IAAF&#x27;s ruling council, World Athletics upheld its ban on Russia&#x27;s track and field team from entering the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
In February 2017, All-Russia Athletic Federation was disqualified by decision of the World Athletics Council for eight years for the creation of a doping system.

World Athletics has since resisted demands that Russia be re-instated, on the basis that the country repeatedly failed to satisfy all the agreed criteria. The decision was supported by Sean Ingle of &quot;The Guardian&quot; who wrote in a column that World Athletics should maintain their ban on Russia through the 2016 Olympics in Rio. That meant Russian athletes could not compete at all major events in the following years, including the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London and the 2018 European Championships in Berlin. In September 2018, World Athletics faced a legal challenge by Russia to overturn the suspension after the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, but Hugo Lowell of the &quot;i newspaper&quot; reported the country&#x27;s status would not change. The legal case was later dropped.

==Russian suspension==
World Athletics was the first international sporting body to suspend the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF) from World Athletics starting in 2015, for eight years, due to doping violations, making it ineligible to host World Athletics events or send teams to international championships. However, Russian athletes were eligible to compete pursuant to the Authorised Neutral Athlete (ANA) process. 

In 2022, though, World Athletics imposed sanctions against the Member Federations of Russia and Belarus because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and all athletes, support personnel, and officials from Russia and Belarus were excluded from all World Athletics Series events for the foreseeable future, and Russian athletes who had received ANA status for 2022 were excluded from World Athletics Series events for the foreseeable future. World Athletics Council also applied sanctions on the Belarus Athletic Federation, including banning its hosting of any international or European athletics events, representation at Congress or in decisions which require Congressional votes, involvement of its personnel in programs, and accreditation to attend any World Athletics Series events.

<doc id="86445" wikidata="Q1778869" url="?curid=86445" title="Slane">
<text>Slane () is a village in County Meath, in Ireland. The village stands on a steep hillside on the left bank of the River Boyne at the intersection of the N2 (Dublin to Monaghan road) and the N51 (Drogheda to Navan road). As of the 2022 census, Slane&#x27;s population was 1,445. The village and surrounding area contains many historic sites dating back over 5,000 years. The village centre, as it is laid-out today, dates mainly from the 18th century. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==
The area and its surroundings have been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era. Habitation at the Hill of Slane settlement and upon the introduction of Christianity is attested in the Annals of Inisfallen and hagiography of Saint Patrick. The earliest surviving structures within the boundaries of the modern-day village were built by the invading Norman family of the Flanders (now Fleming), during the Norman invasion of Ireland. The most relatively undisturbed structure, built under the feudal lordship of this family, is a motte and bailey, which is in close proximity to the Hill of Slane settlement.

Following the Williamite confiscations, which saw the Flemings dispossessed, the present form of the Castle and the village centre were re-cast and in the latter case, laid out as a model British village by the Ulster plantation family of the Conynghams, in what is considered a typical example of 18th-century town planning.

As part of this remodelling, today in the centre of the village stand four nearly identical Georgian houses. The four houses stand at the intersection of the two main streets in the village. While the four faces of the houses and the four &quot;open&quot; streets form an octagon. The feature is known as &quot;The Square&quot; due to what is seen as the vertex position, that each house occupies. The southwesternmost house that forms the square, served as the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks and gaol, up until the founding of the Irish State. The two main streets in the village feature 18th-century grey limestone buildings with slate roofs, oriel windows and archways.

The village centre also incorporates &quot;Gallows hill&quot;, the foot of which is essentially the location of the present day &quot;Slane Credit Union&quot; and a hill so named for the United Irishmen who were publicly executed there on a gallows in an attempt to deter further agitations for independence, following the failed 1798 uprising.

In 2007 Meath County Council proposed that both Slane village and the mill be recognised as Architectural Conservation Areas and protected accordingly.

==Population and demographics==

In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, Slane doubled in population, from 699 to 1,369 inhabitants.

As of the 2006 census, there were 1,099 people living in Slane, having grown from a population of 823 in 2002. The population of the village and the surrounding rural area was 1,587 in 2006, up from 1,336 in 2002.

==Sport==
The earliest recorded inter-county match of &quot;caid&quot;, equivalent to modern Gaelic football, in the entirety of Ireland; was one between Louth and Meath, in the fields of Slane, in 1712, about which the poet S√©amas Dall Mac Cuarta wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning &quot;Ba haigeanta&quot;.

The modern-day Slane Gaelic Football Club comprises the local parish Gaelic Athletic Association Gaelic football teams for the urban and rural areas of Slane. Teams play their home games in Toddy Harding Park, located north of the village. Slane Wanderers is the village&#x27;s local football club, whose home games are played in Wheatfield Park.

In 1979, the inaugural Irish Motocross Grand Prix was held in Slane.

== Places of Interest ==

===The Hill of Slane===


To the north of the village rises the Hill of Slane, which stands above the surroundings. There are a number of historic sites located around the top of the hill. In the Metrical Dindshenchas, a collection of bardic verse, the ancient Fir Bolg king Sl√°ine mac Dela was said to have been buried here, in the place that had been called &quot;Druim Fuar&quot; that came to be known in his memory &quot;Dumha Sl√°ine&quot;. There is an artificial mound on the western end of the hilltop. The hill may have been chosen as the site of a Christian abbey due to the presence of an existing Tuatha D√© Danann shrine, the remains of which may be two standing stones in the burial yard.

Muirchu moccu Machtheni, in his highly mythologised seventh-century Life of Patrick, says that Saint Patrick lit a Paschal fire on this hilltop in A.D. 433 in defiance of the High King Laoire who forbid any other fires while a festival fire was burning on the Hill of Tara. Historians and archaeologists agree that Muirchu has moved to Slane a fire lit elsewhere; The Hill of Slane can be seen from the Hill of Tara which is about away. According to Muirchu, Logaire was so impressed by Patrick&#x27;s devotion that, despite his defiance (or perhaps because of it), he let him continue his missionary work in Ireland. It is somewhat more certain that Patrick appointed a bishop of Slane, Saint Erc.

The Hill of Slane remained a centre of religion and learning for many centuries after Saint Patrick. The Annals of the Four Masters record that in A.D. 948 &quot;The belfry of Slaine [an Irish round tower] was burned by the foreigners [Vikings], with its full of relics and distinguished persons, together with Caeineachair, Lector of Slaine, and the crozier of the patron saint, and a bell which was the best of bells.&quot; Nothing remains of the tower today, although the ruins of a friary church and college can be seen on the top of the hill. It is known that Slane Friary was restored in 1512. The ruins include a high early gothic tower. The friary was abandoned in 1723.

The traditional Christian hymn &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; is set to an early medieval Irish folk song named &quot;Slane&quot; which is about the Hill of Slane.

Approximately 150 meters west of the college and friary church, hidden by trees, lay the steeply inclined remains of a twelfth-century Norman motte and bailey, built by Richard Fleming in the 1170s. This was the seat of the Flemings of Slane, barons of Slane. The Flemings moved to a castle on the left bank of the River Boyne, the current location of Slane Castle. The Flemings were lords of Slane from the twelfth century until the seventeenth century, when the Conyngham family replaced them as lords of Slane during the Williamite Confiscations.

===Slane Castle===

Slane Castle stands on the river about upstream from the centre of the village. There is an ancient well in the grounds of the castle near the river. In Irish mythology (specifically the account found in the Cath Maigh Tuireadh), the well was blessed by Dian Cecht so that the Tuatha D√© Danann could bathe in it and be healed, allegedly, healing all wounds but decapitation. However upon the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and the policy of Christian reinterpretation for pagan sites, the well is now known as &quot;Our lady&#x27;s well&quot;. Legion of Mary‚Äìled pilgrimages to the site are hosted every August.

The castle grounds have been the site of large rock concerts since 1981.

Also within the grounds of Slane Castle (demesne) are the ruins of St. Erc&#x27;s Hermitage. This consists of a late 15 to 16th century chapel, an earlier dwelling, a stone arched footbridge over a stream/tributary that feeds into the Boyne and the stone quarry face from where the materials for construction were taken. Local folklore has it that during the 19th-century move of the &quot;apostle&#x27;s stone&quot;, a stone carving of the crucifixion of Christ, which was taken from this chapel to be placed in the modern church in the village, the 200¬†kg stone carving was to mysteriously find its way back to the Hermitage in the still dead of night. A portion of a celtic cross carving, that was also initially part of St. Erc&#x27;s Hermitage is now housed in an Iron frame beside the altar within Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church on Chapel street. A catholic church was built c.1805. Not to be confused with the similarly named Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland, on main street, built 1797 &quot;M.DCC.XCVII.&quot;

In 2009 &quot;Slane Castle Whiskey&quot;, began to be bottled and labelled, a blended whiskey, it was created by Noel Sweeney and made at the Cooley mountain distillery outside Dundalk.

Following a change in ownership, the Cooley distillery ceased further collaboration. Resulting in the financing and construction by Brown Forman of &quot;Slane Castle Distillery&quot;, completed in 2017, it is owned and operated by Henry and Alex Conyngham. The whiskey that is intended to be produced in the distillery, carries the label, &quot;SLANE Irish Whiskey&quot;, with the placename of &quot;Slane&quot;, since 2018, now a registered trademark, controversially held by the owner of &quot;Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited&quot;.

===Slane Mill===

In the 1760s Boyne Navigation opened between Slane and Oldbridge, approximately down river. This is a series of canals which made the River Boyne navigable to small boats from Slane to the port in Drogheda. A canal which is part of the navigation runs parallel to the river on the south bank near Slane. David Jebb was the engineer in charge of the construction. Once the navigation was opened as far as Slane, Jebb himself built a flour mill at Slane. Slane Mill stands on the north bank of the River Boyne beside the N2 bridge. The mill is a five-storey cut-stone building. When the mill was completed in 1766, it was the largest flour mill in Ireland.

By channelling the water of the Boyne through the weir that passes under the five-storey building, the water-powered mill in the building ground flour until the 1870s, at which point roller mills replaced grindstones. The mill building was later converted to processing Irish flax for clothing.

With competition in the textile industry, the mill began to transition from primary sector to more secondary finished goods, and to that end, the workforce largely moved to the &quot;new mill&quot; in the early-mid-20th century, which could house the longer lines of power looms. A concrete walkway cutting through the forest that separates the two mills was similarly built to allow a quicker exchange of personnel. The now increasingly idle water-powered mill in what became the &quot;old mill&quot;, was converted into a dedicated low head hydro power run-of-the-river hydroelectricity generating station. Its operators received a cheque from the ESB for a number of decades until it fell into disrepair.

By the late 20th century, both mills shared the fate of most others in the textile industry of western Europe; repeated downsizing brought about by a failure to innovate a desirable and unique design signature, competition from businesses with greater supply-chain vertical integration, the need to upgrade to more modern air-jet looms and cheaper labour in the far East have all conspired to ensure the &quot;new mill&quot; likewise has all but left the textile industry that was once the primary employer in Slane.

===Slane Bridge===

The N2 crosses the River Boyne south of the village. The road descends a steep hill from the village and makes an almost ninety-degree turn onto the 14th-century bridge. This bend was the scene of at least 22 fatalities in the late 20th century. As you climb the hill towards Slane village the wall on the right-hand side of the road has a number of small white crosses, each representing a death on this stretch of road. Most of the crashes have involved heavy goods vehicles which are not able to slow down sufficiently to make the sharp bend after picking up speed on the hill. Meath County Council and the National Roads Authority have installed a number of traffic calming measures over the years in an attempt to make the bend onto the bridge safer. These include separate traffic signals for heavy goods vehicles and cars, as well as a 30km/h speed limit throughout the village. Since their installation, fatal accidents have ceased. It was hoped that the opening of the M1 motorway would divert a lot of the heavy traffic from the village but there is evidence that many heavy goods vehicles still use the N2 (and thus Slane bridge) to avoid paying the toll on the M1 bridge. Planning permission for a 3.5¬†km bypass of Slane was refused by An Bord Plean√°la in 2012, due to heritage concerns regarding the nearby Newgrange monument. An Bord Plean√°la said that due to the proposed road being in the &quot;viewshed&quot; of the Newgrange UNESCO site, approval would only be considered if no alternative route was possible.

The bridge has not always been the source of tragedy, the evening of 18 May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the community when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was travelling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming down the hill and it rolled over the bridge wall into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom. Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, but the actual quantity of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.

==Near Slane==

There are many other historical sites in the area around Slane. The Br√∫ na B√≥inne complex of Neolithic chamber tombs lies on the River Boyne, downstream from the village. This includes Newgrange, a passage tomb built c. 3200 BC.
Across the river from the old mill stand the ruins of Fennor Castle/Tower House, adjacent to Fennor Church and its graveyard.

The ruins of Castle Dexter which was built circa the 12th century, lay approximately 2 kilometres (1.3 miles) west of Slane Castle and it is likewise sited near the banks of the River Boyne. 18th-century drawings and watercolours of how this castle appeared are held in the National Library of Ireland.

In common with the town of Drogheda and the area around the adjacent limestone quarry of Platin, a number of now overgrown lime kilns dot the hills of Slane, with the most visible being behind the only service station remaining in the village and to the rear of Ledwidge Cottage.

Rosnaree Mill and its accompanying Sheela na Gig, a stone carving which has been taken indoors to prevent further weathering, can be viewed upon request to the owner at George&#x27;s Patisseries on Chapel Street, Slane.
The site of the Battle of the Boyne is downriver, east, from Slane.

==Transport==
Bus √âireann route 190 links Slane to Drogheda, Navan, Trim, Mullingar and Athlone. There is a bus in each direction every hour to/from Navan, Trim and Drogheda and every two hours to Athlone. The bus to Duleek was withdrawn in November 2013. Collins Coaches operate a route linking Slane to Dublin, Collon, Ardee and Carrickmacross with one journey each way to/from Ballybay. McConnons also serve Slane with a few services a day. The Sunday only Bus √âireann route 177 providing a single journey each way via Slane on the Monaghan to Dublin route was withdrawn in November 2013.

==Slane local electoral area==
Slane is also the name of a local electoral area encompassing a large area of eastern County Meath from Lobinstown to the Irish Sea. This area includes other towns larger but not older than Slane in the modern day, such as Duleek, Stamullen and the portions of the environs of Drogheda which are in County Meath. The population of Slane Local Electoral Area was 32,126 in 2006.

==&quot;Slane&quot; trademark controversy==
An application by &quot;Slane Castle Whiskey&quot; to both the EU Intellectual Property Office and the US Patent and Trade Mark Office, to trademark the placename of &quot;Slane&quot; was filed in 2015. This trademarking became known after a business in the village, which had desired to use &quot;Slane&quot; in its title, discovered it was blocked from doing so. The controversy, around the trademarking includes that this application was designed to cast a very wide net, over a range of goods and services, not limited to alcohol, resulting in the trademark-holders controlling an array of other categories. In the EU jurisdiction, the attempt had been granted, without the prerequisite of a simple web-search being conducted on the name, raising issues of corruption and reassessment being required, as an earlier EU-trademark-ruling exists, that explicitly prohibits businesses from trademarking the name of historical places.

In the still ongoing US case, the attempt to trademark &quot;Slane&quot; was refused in 2015 on the grounds that, upon doing a web-search, the word is both the name of a place and there are other local businesses with a long-standing use of &quot;Slane&quot; as part of their name.

<text>Ogma () is a god from Irish and Scottish mythology. A member of the Tuatha D√© Danann, he is often considered a deity and may be related to the Gallic god Ogmios. According to the Ogam Tract, he is the inventor of Ogham, the script in which Irish Gaelic was first written.

==Name and Epithets==
===Etymology===
The name Ogma is believed to originate from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ak-&quot; or &quot;*ag-&quot; meaning &quot;to cut,&quot; which refers to the method in which ogham was incised into stone and wood. In Ogham, his name would be written¬†.

===Epithets===
Ogma is given three epithets in Irish Gaelic tradition: 
&quot;Grianainech&quot; ‚Äúsun-faced‚Äù or ‚Äúshining, radiant countenance‚Äù on p. 303 of the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; (The Cattle Raid of Cooley) and p.187 of Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (Book of Invasions); 
&quot;Trenfher&quot; ‚ÄúStrongman‚Äù or ‚ÄúChampion‚Äù in sections 59 and 162 of the Do Cath Mag Tuired (Second Battle of Moytura); and 
&quot;Griain-√©igis&quot; ‚ÄúShining sage or learned man‚Äù in section 12 of Foras Feasa ar √âirinn (History of Ireland). 

Many scholars have credited The Dagda&#x27;s son Cermait&#x27;s epithet &quot;Milbel&quot;, or &quot;honey-mouthed&quot; or &quot;eloquence&quot; with Ogma, but this confusion seems to be an incorrect comparison by MacKillop .

==Mythology==
He fights in the first battle of Magh Tuiredh when the Tuatha D√© Danann take Ireland from the Fir Bolg. Under the reign of Bres, when the Tuatha D√© Danann are reduced to servitude, Ogma is forced to carry firewood, but nonetheless is the only one of the Tuatha D√© who proves his athletic and martial prowess in contests before the king. When Bres is overthrown and Nuadu restored, Ogma is his champion. His position is threatened by the arrival of Lugh at the court, so Ogma challenges him by lifting a great flagstone, which normally required eighty oxen to move it, and hurling it out of Tara, but Lugh answers the challenge by hurling it back. When Nuadu hands command of the Battle of Mag Tuired to Lugh, Ogma becomes Lugh&#x27;s champion and promises to repel the Fomorian king, Indech, and his bodyguard, and to defeat a third of the enemy. During the battle he finds Orna, the sword of the Fomorian king Tethra, which recounts the deeds done with it when unsheathed. During the battle Ogma and Indech fall in single combat, although there is some confusion in the texts as in &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; Ogma, Lugh and the Dagda pursue the Fomorians after the battle to recover the harp of Uaitne, the Dagda&#x27;s harper. Which substantiates the reason that the Dagda gives S√≠d Aircheltrai to Ogma in De Gab√°il in tS√≠da (Taking of the Sidhe Mound) and is also referred to be in residence in Brecc on page 303 in the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge. 

He often appears as a triad with Lugh and the Dagda (The Dagda is his brother and Lugh is his half-brother), who are sometimes collectively known as the &quot;tr√≠ d√©e d√°na&quot; or three gods of skill, although that designation is elsewhere applied to other groups of characters. His father is Elatha and his mother is usually given as Ethliu, sometimes as √âta√≠n. In the Ogam Tract, he is called the son of Elatha and brother of Delbaeth and Bres. Oghma&#x27;s sons include Delbaeth and Tuireann.

=== Invention of Ogham ===
In the Ogam Tract Ogma is said to be a man skilled in speech and poetry who invented the Ogham as proof of his ingenuity and to create a speech that belongs to learned men apart from rustics. In the same tract Ogma is called the father of the Ogham alphabet, and his knife or hand its mother. The same tract says that sound was the father of Ogham and matter its mother.

==Related figures==
Scholars of Celtic mythology have proposed that Ogma represents the vestiges of an ancient Celtic god. By virtue of his battle prowess and the invention of Ogham, he is compared with Ogmios, a Gaulish deity associated with eloquence and equated with Herakles. J. A. MacCulloch compares Ogma&#x27;s epithet &quot;grianainech&quot; (sun-face) with Lucian&#x27;s description of the &quot;smiling face&quot; of Ogmios, and suggests Ogma&#x27;s position as champion of the Tuatha D√© Danann may derive &quot;from the primitive custom of rousing the warriors&#x27; emotions by eloquent speeches before a battle&quot;, although this is hardly supported by the texts. Scholars such Rudolf Thurneysen and Anton van Hamel dispute any link between Ogma and Ogmios. Eufydd fab D√¥n is another figure from Welsh mythology whose name is believed to derive from that of Ogmios and therefore may be related to Ogma.

<text>Ogmios (sometimes Ogmius; ) is the name given to a Celtic god of eloquence described in Heracles, a work of the Syrian satirist Lucian.

Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Heracles&quot; is a short text, intended to be read aloud before a longer public performance. It describes Lucian&#x27;s viewing of a strange image of Ogmios in Gaul. In this image, the god is depicted as a dark-skinned, aged version of the Greek hero Heracles, with a group of happy devotees tied by bejewelled chains to the god&#x27;s tongue. A Celt approaches Lucian and explains these features, telling him that they reflect a native association of Ogmios with eloquence (which, the Celt explains, reaches its highest level in old age). Lucian uses this anecdote to prove to his audience that, in old age, he is still competent to deliver public performances.

The evidence outside of Lucian&#x27;s text for the god Ogmios is quite limited. No image has been found which comes close to the one Lucian describes. The only mostly-accepted attestations of the god in archaeology are on two curse tablets from Brigantium (in Austria). Most scholars accept the existence of the god Ogmios, but a minority have expressed scepticism.

In medieval Irish mythology, the god Ogma was fabled as the inventor of the early Irish alphabet Ogham. Ogmios has frequently been connected with Ogma, but the nature of this connection has proven difficult to define. An etymology linking Ogmios, Ogma, and Ogham poses unresolved chronological and phonological problems. 

Lucian&#x27;s text was much read in the Renaissance, and &quot;Gallic Hercules&quot; (as Ogmios was known) inspired a number of artistic works, including drawings by Albrecht D√ºrer and Hans Holbein the Younger.

==Etymology==
Georges Dottin, Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc&#x27;h and have proposed to derive the god&#x27;s name derives from Greek (, &quot;furrow, path&quot;). Though Lucian tell us that Ogmios is the name of the god &quot;in their native tongue&quot;, Guyonvarc&#x27;h and Le Roux believe it is possible the name may have been borrowed by Gaulish speakers from Greek in the parts of Gaul where Greek was widely spoken (such as Massalia). Jan de Vries is sceptical of this possibility. The Greek word seems to have had a connotation of leadership, which agrees with the iconography Lucian describes. The &quot;Nomina im Indogermanischen Lexikon&quot; notes the similarity with (, &quot;ruling over the furrows&quot;), an epithet of the Greek god Demeter.
Celtic etymologies of the theonym have also been given. The potential existence of a reflex of the god&#x27;s name in Irish mythology (Ogma, discussed below) has been taken to count in favour of such an etymology. Xavier Delamarre suggests that Ogmios is a reflex (through proto-Celtic) of proto-Indo-European * (&quot;way&quot;), derived from the PIE verbal root * (&quot;to drive&quot;). He associates with theonym with the meaning of &quot;a leader along a path&quot;. Pierre-Yves Lambert suggested that Ogmios was a reflex of the proto-Celtic (&quot;to sew&quot;).

==Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Heracles&quot;==
Lucian (125 CE ‚Äì after 180 CE) was a Syrian satirist and rhetorician who wrote in Ancient Greek. His short work &quot;Heracles&quot; or &quot;Hercules&quot; () is a , that is, a short introduction intended to arouse audience interest prior to a longer lecture. It reflects on its author&#x27;s old age, and his ability to deliver public oratory, concluding with an emphatic affirmation of this ability. On this basis, the text is dated late in Lucian&#x27;s life, after his return from Egypt in 175 CE.
 The passage relevant to Ogmios comes at the beginning, where Lucian delivers an ekphrasis (literary description of a work of art) of an image of Heracles:

Puzzling at this picture, a Celt fluent in Greek, whom Lucian describes as versed in Greek and Celtic lore, interjects with an explanation. The copious quotations from Greek that the Celt adduces have been omitted from the following.

Lucian often chose exotic subject matter to arouse his audience&#x27;s interest. His choice of subject matter in &quot;Heracles&quot; was no doubt tailored towards this end; his listeners, likely in the Greek East, would have hardly been familiar with Celtic society. The rhetorician&#x27;s intentions were, in turn, hardly ethnographic. Andreas Hofeneder points out that Lucian neglects to tell us where in Gaul his story takes place; what sort of building the picture was located in; and even the nature of the picture (whether a relief, a mosaic, or a painting). Lucian&#x27;s other writings tell us that he worked as rhetorician in Gaul, but they do not tell us where or when. It has been suggested that Lucian&#x27;s narrative may have taken place in the semi-Hellenized south of Gaul, perhaps Massalia, but this is far from certain.

The speaker who interjects to explain the image (in this narrative, a learned Celt) is something of a stock figure in ekphrases. Paul Friedl√§nder pointed out that Lucian&#x27;s introduction of the Celt borrows material from the &quot;Tabula Cebetis&quot;, a popular philosophical ekphrasis. Lucian describes the Celt as a &quot;philosopher in local matters&quot;. It was common in Greek accounts of the Celts to refer to the druids as philosophers, and on this basis it has been suggested that the Celt who addressed Lucian was a druid, however by the time Lucian wrote the druids had been suppressed by Roman decree for over a century. Eugenio Amato suggests that if Lucian had encountered a druid, he would have been unlikely to credit a member of the maligned religious order so highly. Amato has suggested that the Celtic speaker is Lucian&#x27;s imitation of his contemporary Favorinus, a Roman sophist of Gaulish extraction who had great command of Greek poetry and wrote a discourse on old age, and whom Lucian elsewhere refers to. The abundant quotations from Greek literature may reflect Favorinus&#x27;s preoccupations, though little of the sophist&#x27;s work has survived.

The reality of the image Lucian describes has been repeatedly doubted. Lucian&#x27;s characteristic mixture of satire and journalism, and especially the mockery he directs towards religious feeling, make him a problematic source for the history of religion. The view of scholars in the 19th and early 20th centuries of Lucian as a straightforward purveyor of falsehoods has largely subsided, and scholars now tend to take a more nuanced view. In the 19th and early 20th centuries researchers were unanimous in seeing Lucian&#x27;s image as an invention. More recent scholarship has been balanced between the two views. 

In favour of the existence of this image, it has been pointed out that nothing about Lucian&#x27;s story is impossible. The satirist certainly visited Gaul, where wall paintings of mythological scenes are known to have existed. Amato suggests he could have learned of this picture from Favorinus. Marion Euskirchen took the &quot;detailed iconographic elements of the image described by Lucian, as well as their unusual combination&quot; to speak to its veracity. and accept it as authentic, but are sceptical of Lucian&#x27;s explanation. Hafner, for example, argued the image was identifiable as a classical depiction of Heracles&#x27; enemy Geras, though Euskirchen is unconvinced the ekphrasis can be read this way.

Against its existence, sceptics have adduced &quot;the absurdity of this explanation, and its all-too-visible link with the necessities of a &quot;prolalia&quot;&quot;. Ja≈õ Elsner, for example, calls the image &quot;effectively a self-portrait of the orator as an old man&quot;. No wall paintings with scenes of a non-classical type have survived in Gaul. suggests that Lucian composed plausible elements (allegorical painting, the god Ogmios, his stay in Gaul) fictitiously for literary ends. More recently, scholars such as and Hofeneder have counted the paucity of archaeological evidence for Ogmios (discussed below) against the reality of this image.

==Ogmios outside of Lucian==
Lucian&#x27;s text is a valuable, but problematic and isolated source. Ogmios is mentioned nowhere else in classical literature, with the exception of two Byzantine lexicons which clearly depend on Lucian. The archaeological evidence for Ogmios is very limited. The only mostly-accepted attestations of the god, outside of Lucian, are two curse tablets from Brigantium. The existence of Ogmios is accepted by a majority of scholars, even among those (such as Spickermann) who doubt the authenticity of Lucian&#x27;s narrative. A minority‚ÄîBauchhen√ü and Hofeneder‚Äîhave expressed scepticism about Ogmios&#x27;s existence.

===Hercules in Gaul===
By way of his adventures through Western Europe, ancient literature often associated Hercules and the Celts. Parthenius of Nicaea, for example, claimed that Heracles was, through his son Keltos, progenitor of all the Celts. In the Roman era, Hercules was worshipped in Gaul, especially in his role as patron of sacred springs. However, Ogmios does not seem to have been important to this worship. The epigraphic evidence reveals very little linking Hercules to native deities; and nothing at all linking Hercules to Ogmios.

The iconographic evidence for Hercules Ogmios is little more impressive. No images of Hercules found in Gaul come near the arrangement described by Lucian. Salomon Reinach linked Ogmios to two representations from Gaul, both quite late: a bronze statuette of Hercules, bent with age; and a terra sigillata with a relief of an apparently bald Hercules. However, Stephanie Boucher argued the hunch of the former was a product of low quality bronze-work; and Euskirchen has argued that the latter&#x27;s baldness could have been caused by wear to the pottery.

===Curse tablets===

Two curse tablets, both found in Brigantium (in Austria), have been linked to Ogmios. The first, discovered in 1865 and now lost, dates to the 1st century CE; the second, discovered in 1930, dates to the 1st/2nd century CE. The former curse invokes a god to silence any witnesses who would speak against the (female) curse-writer&#x27;s interest in court. The latter curse invokes Dis Pater and another god to damage a young woman&#x27;s body in order that she may be made unmarriageable. In 1943, Robert Egger proposed to read both these tablets as invoking the god Ogmios. Egger&#x27;s reading has largely met with agreement in the scholarly literature, though Hofeneder and Euskirchen have expressed scepticism.

Egger argued that only gods of the underworld were invoked on curse tablets, and that therefore Ogmios should be interpreted as a chthonic deity. Further to this point, Egger pointed out that Lucian compares Ogmios to Iapetus and Charon, both figures of the Greek underworld. Egger&#x27;s association of Ogmios with the underworld has met with some agreement in the literature, but more often with scepticism. de Vries points out that a god only had to be considered powerful to be invoked in a curse. For example (as Euskirchen points out) a curse tablet invoking Nodens (a Celtic god of healing) is known from Gloucestershire. Euskirchen will also not allow that Lucian&#x27;s comparison of Ogmios to Iapetus and Charon goes further than their skin colour.

===Other possible attestations===

 connected Lucian&#x27;s image of Ogmios with coin-type from Armorica, on one side of which is depicted a beardless male bust with a number of pearl-like chains extending from his head. Any relationship of this coin-type with Ogmios is largely rejected now, following arguments by Charles Robert, who pointed out that the coins appear to be copies of Greek staters of Philip II, and in any case diverge from Lucian&#x27;s Ogmios insofar as the coins depict a young man, with chains emerging from his head rather than his mouth, and no faces on the end of these chains. de Vries accepts the possibility that these coins represent a different iconographic variety of Ogmios, known in the north of Gaul.

Outside than the curse tablets, a few inscriptions are insecurely connected with Ogmios. Fritz Heichelheim tentatively identified an inscription on a bronze statue base as a votive dedication to Ogmios. Heichelheim&#x27;s reconstruction has been generally rejected, going back as far as Egger. A lost inscription from Salins-les-Thermes was originally read as a votive inscription to Herculei Ograio. Th√©odore Reinach wanted to emend this to Herculei Ogmio, but it is more likely that this the inscription originally reproduced the known name-pairing Hercueli Graio. Two inscriptions from Iberia, which Francisco Marco Sim√≥n connected with Ogmios, have been given recent readings which preclude his interpretations. A votive altar to Hercules Gallicus in Piedimonte Matese (in Italy), a name-pairing not otherwise attested, could be connected to Ogmios, but is more likely to be related to a local toponym.

The onomastic evidence is also quite limited. A 4th-century CE inscription on a vase found in Kent gives the female personal name Ocmia, which was interpreted by Anne Ross as a female form of Ogmios. The Frankish personal name Ogmireectherius, recorded in the 7th century CE, was given a Celtic etymology by Alfred Holder, who thought the first half of the name incorporated the theonym Ogmios, though Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc&#x27;h has given a Germanic etymology without reference to the theonym.

==In later mythology==
===Ogma and Ogham===
Ogma is a figure of Irish mythology, an orator and warrior of the Tuatha D√© Danann (a supernatural race in medieval Irish literature often thought to represent euhemerized pre-Christian deities). Ogma is described as the inventor of Ogham, an alphabet used to write the early Irish language. A relationship between Ogma and Ogmios has been supposed, but scholars have been &quot;hard-pressed to delineate&quot; the relationship between these figures, as James MacKillop has put it.

The etymologies of Ogma and Ogham are uncertain. It is not even certain that their etymologies must be connected. As Bernhard Maier has pointed out, the tradition which connects Ogma to Ogham is late, and may only reflect the superficial similarity of the two words. The proposal to explain Ogma as a reflex of Ogmios may pose phonological difficulties. The development of proto-Celtic &quot;gm&quot; in Irish is not clear. If it developed like &quot;gn&quot;, the initial g would be dropped, in which case proto-Celtic would have give rise to Middle Irish * or * rather than . If this is the case, a relationship between Ogma and Ogmios would have to be explained by a late borrowing from Gaulish, which creates chronological difficulties for an etymology connecting Ogma and Ogham. On the other hand, given the state of the evidence, Ranko Matasoviƒá entertains the possibility that &quot;g&quot; was preserved before &quot;m&quot; in the transition to Irish.

===Other myths===
 connected Ogmios with some episodes from the Irish tale &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;: one, where a gloomy figure drags seven unwilling figures by a chain around his neck; another, where C√∫ Chulainn grows angry and his body distorts itself horribly, in such a way as MacCulloch compares with iconography of Ogmios. de Vries is sceptical of these parallels, and points out differences between the iconography in Lucian and these scenes. 

John Rh≈∑s proposed that Eufydd fab D√¥n, a minor figure of Welsh mythology, was cognate with Ogmios. This hypothesis has more recently received the favour of .

==In the Renaissance==
The reception of Lucian&#x27;s ekphrasis of Hercules Ogmios in the Renaissance has been described as &quot;astonishingly rich&quot;. Such sources such as Andrea Alciato&#x27;s much-read &quot;Emblemata&quot; and the mythographies of Annius of Viterbo and Natalis Comes popularised the myth of &quot;Gallic Hercules&quot; among humanists and artists. In France, Gallic Hercules was regarded as a founder of the nation, and associated with the French monarchy. A sculpture of Francis I as Ogmios, binding the Four Estates by his tongue, was unveiled in Paris upon the entry of Henry II in 1549. Albrecht D√ºrer&#x27;s rendition of Ogmios as Hermes (pictured above) is well known, but there is also a drawing from the School of Raphael, a wall painting in the &quot;Escurialense&quot;, and a very large number of printed woodcuts.

<text>In Celtic mythology, Dea Matrona (&#x27;Divine Mother&#x27;) was the goddess who gives her name to the river Marne (ancient &quot;Matr≈èna&quot;) in Gaul.

The Gaulish theonym &quot;MƒÅtr-on-ƒÅ&quot; signifies &#x27;Great Mother&#x27; and the goddess of the Marne has been interpreted to be a mother goddess.

Many Gaulish religious images‚Äîincluding inexpensive terracotta statues mass-produced for use in household shrines‚Äîdepict mother goddesses nursing babies or holding fruits, other foods, or small dogs in their laps. In many areas, such &quot;Matronae&quot; were depicted in groups of three (or sometimes two) (see Matres and Matronae for the triads of mother goddesses well attested throughout northern Europe).

The name of Welsh mythological figure Modron, mother of Mabon, is derived from the same etymon (and Mabon has a cognate in Gaulish Maponos).

<doc id="86455" wikidata="Q1143084" url="?curid=86455" title="Deichtine">
<text>In Irish mythology, Deichtine or Deichtire was the sister of Conchobar mac Nessa and the mother of C√∫ Chulainn. Her husband was Sualtam, but C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s real father may have been Lugh of the Tuatha D√© Danann.

In one version of the story she was Conchobar&#x27;s charioteer. When a flock of birds descended on Emain Macha and ate all the grass, the Ulstermen decided to hunt them, and they set off after them in their chariots. They chased them until night fell, and it began to snow, so they decided to seek shelter. They found a house and were welcomed in by the young man who lived there. His wife was in labour at the time, but he showed them hospitality and served them food and drink. His wife gave birth to a baby boy, and at the same time a horse outside the house gave birth to two colts. The Ulstermen went to sleep, but when they woke up they found themselves at the &quot;Brug na B√≥inne&quot; (Newgrange). The house, the man and his wife had vanished, but the baby and the two colts remained. Deichtine took the boy as her foster-son and they returned to Emain.

Soon after the boy fell ill and died. Deichtine took a drink, and a tiny creature leaped from the cup into her mouth. When she fell asleep, Lug appeared to her and told her it was his house they had stayed in that night, and that his child was in her womb. While the Ulstermen whispered that it was actually Conchobar&#x27;s son, the latter betrothed Deichtine to Sualtam mac Roich, who owed him a great favor. Deichtine married Sualtam, and on her wedding night, ashamed to carry another&#x27;s child, &quot;crushed the child within her until she was again like a virgin. Then she slept with her husband and was made pregnant by him and bore a son&quot;.

In another version, Deichtine disappeared from Emain Macha. As before, a flock of birds came to Emain and led the Ulstermen to Lug&#x27;s house, but the wife in labour was Deichtine. They woke up at the Brug na B√≥inne, Lug and the house had vanished, but Deichtine and the baby remained. They returned to Emain and Deichtine married Sualtam.

==Genealogy==
Deichtine&#x27;s ancestry and kin:
Deichtine&#x27;s mother was Maga, daughter of Oengus Og, and her father was Cathbad the Druid. Her sisters were Finchoem, mother of Conall the Victorious, and the mother of Naiose and his brothers. Although Conall the Victorious was a bitter enemy of Anluan and Cet mac Maga, they were his maternal uncles. Cet even protected the pregnant Finchoem until she gave birth and it was prophesied that Conall would be his slayer.

<text>S√∫altam (S√∫altaim, S√∫aldam, S√∫aldaim, S√∫altach) mac R√≥ich is the mortal father of the hero C√∫chulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. His wife is Deichtine, sister of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster. His brother is Fergus mac R√≥ich.

The nature of C√∫chulainn&#x27;s parentage is unclear and inconsistent. In one version, Deichtine fosters the baby son of Lugh, but he becomes sick and dies. Then she is made pregnant by Lugh, who tells her to name the child S√©tanta, but as she is betrothed to S√∫altam, she aborts the pregnancy, marries S√∫altam and has his child, whom she names S√©tanta. The child is later renamed C√∫chulainn. In another version, Deichtine disappears from Emain Macha, until the nobles of Ulster are led by a flock of magical birds to a house, where they are welcomed by Lugh. He tells them his wife is due to give birth soon, and when she does the Ulstermen discover she is Deichtine. The child is named S√©tanta. He is brought up by S√∫altam and Deichtine in their house on Muithemne Plain in County Louth.

Seventeen years later, when queen Medb of Connacht launches the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley) against Ulster, C√∫chulainn and S√∫altam are watching the border at Iraird Cuilenn (Crossakiel, County Meath). While C√∫chulainn tries to hold up the army&#x27;s advance, S√∫altam goes to warn the Conchobar. For unexplained reasons, he does not arrive at Emain Macha for several months. He burst in and cries out that men are being killed, women abducted, and cattle plundered, and that Ailill mac M√°ta, king of Connacht, is responsible. However, he is ignored, for he has failed to follow precedence - no man could speak before the king, and the king could not speak before his three druids - and Conchobar and his druids agree he should be executed. As S√∫altam runs out, he falls against the sharpened rim of his shield and decapitates himself. His severed head is brought back on his shield still crying out that men are being murdered, women abducted and cattle plundered. Finally Conchobar is roused to action and gathers his army for battle.

<text>Alain Lipietz (born 19 September 1947 as Alain Guy Lipiec) is a French engineer, economist and politician, a former Member of the European Parliament, and a member of the French Green Party. He has, however, been suspended from the party since 25 March 2014 and is an elected local politician in Val de Bi√®vre, Paris, France.

==Education and background==
Alain Lipietz was raised in Paris in a middle class, Leftist family. His mother was French and his father was a Jewish Pole, who had fled antisemitism in Poland at the age of two and arrived in France in 1924. They had three children. Lipietz was a precocious child, winning a prize at the age of 15 for public speaking. He studied at the exclusive &quot;√âcole polytechnique&quot; as an engineer (entered in 1966) and the &quot;√âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es&quot; (diploma in 1971). He had participated in the May &#x27;68 protests in Paris, and seen the plight of miners in the north of France, prompting him to study economics, obtaining a Masters from the Sorbonne in 1972.

From 1971 to 1973 he was a researcher in economics at the &quot;Institut de recherche des transports&quot; (The French transportation research institute) and then from 1973 to 1999 at the &quot;Centre d&#x27;√©tudes prospectives d&#x27;√©conomie ‚Äì Math√©matiques appliqu√©es √† la planification&quot; (Center for prospective studies of economics ‚Äì applied mathematics for planning). He became a research director at CNRS from 1988 to 2002. In 1990 he became chief engineer at the Corps of Bridges and Roads (France), and taught at various Paris universities over the course of his career.

Despite his interests in regional planning and economics, since the beginning of his career he also devoted himself to the analysis of social and environmental issues. In particular he contributed to the Regulation school of economic thought, as well as environmental theory and policy.

Lipietz first married at age 20. Francine Compte, a feminist and writer, died of cancer in 2008. He married Natalie Gandais in July 2015.

==Political activities==

Alain Lipietz is a former Maoist. He was then a candidate of Les Verts for the legislative elections of 1986 in Seine-Saint-Denis, and became the national spokesperson of the French Green Party in 1997.

He was an elected representative of the Green Party at the European Parliament from 1999 to 2009, serving two terms.

Alain Lipietz was an adviser to the &quot;Commission √©conomique des Verts&quot;, a member of the &quot;Commission fran√ßaise du d√©veloppement durable&quot; (from 2000) and a member of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;√©tablissement du Coll√®ge de France&quot; (since 2001).

On 21 June 2001, Lipietz was elected as candidate for the French Green Party in the 2002 presidential elections. With 50% of the votes cast in the party&#x27;s primaries, Lipietz narrowly beat rival candidate No√´l Mam√®re.

However, controversy arose during the summer of 2001, when Lipietz seemed to have appeared sympathetic to separatists jailed for planting bombs in Corsica. A second controversy was his opposition to reopening the Mont Blanc Tunnel between France and Italy, which had been closed in 1999 after 39 people died in a fire. Meanwhile, the party dropped from seven to five percent support in opinion polls. Finally, on 14 October 2001, Les Verts managed to survive a major internal crisis and changed their Presidential candidate, dropping Alain Lipietz to choose No√´l Mam√®re, who had supposedly made the irrevocable decision not to run just a day sooner.

== Court challenge to SNCF ==
In 2006 Alain and his sister H√©l√®ne, A former Green Senator and lawyer, sued the French government and SNCF, the national railway of France, for reparations for transporting members of their family to the Drancy deportation camp during World War II. The case was heard in the French Administrative Court, the body charged with trying cases against the French government and its agencies. The defendants argued at trial that they were at the time under orders of the German military; the railroad further argued that the German military threatened to shoot any railroad official who disobeyed their orders. The court disagreed, concluding that the Vichy government could not have avoided knowledge of the prisoners&#x27; likely deportation to concentration camps, and that SNCF made no effort to either protest the transportation or to transport them in a humane manner. On June 6, 2006, the court ordered them to pay ‚Ç¨ 61,000 (almost $80,000).

The French government accepted the decision, but in 2007 SNCF successfully appealed the decision regarding themselves. The appeal court found that SNCF was a separate entity to the government and thus outside the competence of the Administrative court.

The Lipietz family are understood to be considering a further appeal to the State Council in respect of the claim against SNCF.

==French local politics==
In 2014, Alain Lipietz ranked second in the EELV (Greens) candidate list for Villejuif (94) municipal election in the Paris southern suburbs, and as a candidate for President of the Agglomeration of Val de Bi√®vre (which comprises Arcueil, Cachan, Fresnes, Gentilly, Le Kremlin-Bic√™tre, L&#x27;Ha√ø-les-Roses and Villejuif). Coming fifth, he and colleagues then engineered a coalition with right wing candidates and socialist dissidents, to attain a majority coalition. The national Green Party suspended the local EELV Villejuif candidates for this alliance with the right wing, which is against party policy. Alain Lipietz has become a councillor in the majority coalition and one of the vice-presidents of the Agglomeration of Val de Bi√®vre. He remains suspended by the Greens.

<text>Saint Elen (, ¬†&quot;Helen of the Hosts&quot;), often anglicized as Helen, was a late 4th-century founder of churches in Wales. Although never formally canonized by Rome, Elen is traditionally considered a saint in the Welsh Church; in English she is sometimes known as Saint Helen of Caernarfon to distinguish her from Saint Helena (&quot;Helen of Constantinople&quot;).

==Church tradition==
Traditionally, she is said to have been a daughter of the Romano-British ruler Octavius / Eudaf Hen (and therefore sister of Conan Meriadoc) and the wife of Magnus Maximus / Macsen Wledig, the 4th-century emperor in Britain, Gaul, and Spain who was killed in battle in 388.

Elen was mother of five, including a boy named Custennin or Cystennin (Constantine). She lived about sixty years later than Helena of Constantinople, the mother of Constantine the Great, with whom she has often been confused. She is patron of Llanelan in West Gower and of the church at Penisa&#x27;r-waun near Caernarfon, where her feast day is 22 May. Together with her sons, Cystennin and Peblig (Publicus, named in the calendar of the Church in Wales), she is said to have introduced into Wales the Celtic form of monasticism from Gaul. Saint Gregory of Tours and Sulpicius Severus record that Maximus and his wife met Saint Martin of Tours while they were in Gaul.

==Literary tradition==
Elen&#x27;s story is told in &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;, one of the tales associated with the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Welsh mythology remembers her as the daughter of a chieftain of north Wales named Eudaf or Eudwy, who probably lived somewhere near the Roman base of Segontium, now Caernarfon. She is remembered for having Macsen build roads across her country so that the soldiers could more easily defend it from attackers, thus earning her the name &quot;Elen Luyddog&quot; (Elen of the Hosts).

==Legacy==
She is said to have ordered the making of Sarn Helen, the great Roman road running from Caernarfon to south Wales via Dolgellau, Pennal and Bremia (Llanddewi Brefi). Though this road bears her name, it is considerably older than Elen&#x27;s accepted time period. Many other Roman roads in Wales bear her name (e.g. Llwybr Elen) and she is thus acknowledged as the patron saint of British roadbuilders and the protectress of travellers. There are over 20 holy wells in Britain dedicated to a &quot;Saint Helen&quot;, although these are frequently taken as honoring the mother of Constantine the Great.

<doc id="86466" wikidata="Q1245793" url="?curid=86466" title="Emer">
<text>Emer (), in modern Irish &#x27; or &#x27; (with variations including &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;) and in Scottish Gaelic &#x27;, is the name of the daughter of Forgall Monach and the wife of the hero C√∫ Chulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

==Legend==

===&quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; &quot;The Wooing of Emer&quot;===

The Ulstermen searched all over Ireland for a suitable wife for C√∫ Chulainn, but he would have none but Emer. He visited her at Forgall&#x27;s house at Lusk, County Dublin, and wooed her by trading cryptic riddles with her. Emer would accept C√∫ Chulainn as a husband, but only when his deeds justified it.

However, Forgall was opposed to the match. He came to Ulster in disguise and suggested that C√∫ Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Sc√°thach in Scotland, hoping the ordeal would be too much for him and he would be killed. C√∫ Chulainn took up the challenge. He learned all the arts of war from Sc√°thach, and while he was there slept with her rival Aoife, or A√≠fe, leaving her pregnant.

In the meantime, Forgall offered Emer to Lugaid mac No√≠s, a king of Munster. However, when he heard that Emer loved C√∫ Chulainn, Lugaid refused her hand.

C√∫ Chulainn returned from Scotland fully trained, but Forgall still refused to let him marry Emer. C√∫ Chulainn stormed Forgall&#x27;s fortress, killing twenty-four of Forgall&#x27;s men, abducted Emer and stole Forgall&#x27;s treasure. Forgall himself fell from the ramparts to his death. An ally of Forgall&#x27;s, Scenn Menn, tried to stop the fleeing couple, but C√∫ Chulainn killed him in single combat at a ford. Having proved his prowess, Emer now agreed to marry him.

Conchobar mac Nessa, the king of Ulster, had the &quot;right of the first night&quot; over all marriages of his subjects. He was afraid of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s reaction if he exercised it in this case, but would lose his authority if he didn&#x27;t. A solution was found - Conchobar would sleep with Emer on the night of the wedding, but Cathbad the druid would sleep between them.

===Emer&#x27;s only jealousy===

Though C√∫ Chulainn had many lovers, Emer&#x27;s only jealousy came when he was entranced into love with Fand, wife of Manann√°n mac Lir, the king of the great sea, as recounted in the narrative &quot;Serglige Con Culainn&quot; (&quot;The Wasting Sickness of C√∫ Chulainn&quot;). She decided to kill her rival, but when she saw the strength of Fand&#x27;s love for C√∫ Chulainn she decided to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer&#x27;s magnanimity, decided to return to her own husband. Manann√°n shook his cloak between C√∫ Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two would never meet again, and C√∫ Chulainn and Emer drank a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.

===Other stories===

When A√≠fe&#x27;s son Connla came to Ireland in search of his father, Emer realised who he was and tried to persuade C√∫ Chulainn not to kill him, but to no avail.

Emer was said to possess the six gifts of womanhood: beauty, a gentle voice, sweet words, wisdom, skill at needlework and chastity.

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
Emer is the subject of William Butler Yeats&#x27; play &quot;The Only Jealousy of Emer&quot;. This play is one of his five famous C√∫ Chulainn pieces, and is written with heavy stylistic influences from the Japanese Noh theatre. The story is taken, with some alterations, from Lady Gregory&#x27;s saga-story of the same name in her collection &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; (1902). &quot;Jealousy&quot; premiered in Amsterdam in 1922, under the direction of Albert van Dalsum with masks created by the sculptor Hildo Krop. It did not play on the Irish stage until May 1926, when it was staged by the Dublin Drama League at the Abbey Theatre.

Emer is mentioned in Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;The Secret Rose&quot;: 
&quot;and him
Who met Fand walking among flaming dew
By a grey shore where the wind never blew,
And lost the world and Emer for a kiss;&quot;

Emer is described in &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt as &quot;The Greatest Pisser&quot; in reference to the manner in which she won Cuchulain&#x27;s hand in marriage. She is also referenced as part of the T√°in-based imagery in M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain&#x27;s &quot;The Withering Branch&quot;.

In November 1943, Scottish Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean published his first individual collection of poems, &quot;D√†in do Eimhir agus D√†in Eile&quot; (Poems to Eimhir and Other Poems). The &quot;D√†in do Eimhir&quot; sequence was one of the most important works published in Gaelic in the 20th century.

Emer is the protagonist of David Duchovny&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Miss Subways&quot; which draws inspiration from the myth.

===Other references===
The L√â Emer (P21), a former ship in the Irish Naval Service, was named after her.

<text>Esus is a Celtic god known from iconographic, epigraphic, and literary sources.

The Roman poet Lucan&#x27;s epic &quot;Pharsalia&quot; mentions Esus, Taranis, and Teutates as gods to whom the Gauls sacrificed humans. This rare mention of Celtic gods under their native names in a Latin text has been the subject of much comment. Almost as often commented on are the scholia to Lucan&#x27;s poem (early medieval, but relying on earlier sources) which tell us the nature of these sacrifices: in particular, that Esus&#x27;s victims were suspended from a tree and bloodily dismembered. This ritual has been compared with a wide range of sources, including Welsh and Germanic mythology, as well as with the violent end of the Lindow Man.

Esus has been connected (through an inscription which identifies him and an allied character, Tarvos Trigaranos, by name) with a pictorial myth on the Pillar of the Boatmen, a Gallo-Roman column from Paris. This myth associates Esus, felling or pruning a tree, with a bull and three cranes. A similar monument to Esus and Tarvos Trigaranos from Trier confirms this association. The nature of this myth is little understood; it at least confirms the scholia&#x27;s association of Esus with trees.

Esus appears rarely in inscriptions, with only two certain attestations of his name in the epigraphic record. His name appears more commonly as an element of personal names. A very large number of etymologies have been proposed for the name Esus.

==Name==
===Etymology===
A very large number of etymologies have been proposed for the name &quot;Esus&quot;. The nature of the theonym is not certain. has suggested it may be a euphemism, cover-name, or epithet of the god. has even questioned whether &quot;Esus&quot; was a name given to only one deity (though his view is a minority one).

The most widely adopted etymology derives Esus&#x27;s name from the proto-Indo-European verbal root (&quot;to be reverent, to worship&quot;), cognate with Italic (&quot;god&quot;). This etymology is supported by the fact that it makes the initial vowel of Esus&#x27;s name long, which agrees with both Lucan&#x27;s scansion and the variant spellings which use &quot;ae&quot; for this vowel. However, D. Ellis Evans points out that the proposed Italic cognate is usually explained by way of an Etruscan root.

Joseph Vendryes linked the name with PIE * (&quot;good&quot;). Jan de Vries is sceptical of this, pointing out that this is difficult to reconcile with the fearful god described in Lucan and the scholia. Meid suggests the name would then be a euphemism, comparing it with the Irish theonym Dagda (&quot;the good god&quot;). Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville linked it to PIE * (&quot;to wish&quot;). T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly linked it to PIE * (&quot;vital force, life&quot;). F√©lix Guirand suggested the name was cognate with Latin (&quot;lord&quot;, &quot;master&quot;), which Meid notes is a common epiclesis given to deities (Freyr, Ba&#x27;al). Other etymologies have variously connected the name with German (&quot;honour&quot;), Ancient Greek (, &quot;to be ashamed&quot;), Old Norse (&quot;brass, copper&quot;), and Breton (&quot;terrible&quot;) 

===As an element of proper names===

Esus is an element of a small number of personal names. In his &quot;Die Komposition in gallischen Personennamen&quot; (1957), lists Esugenus (&quot;Fathered by Esus&quot;), Esumagius (&quot;Powerful through Esus&quot;), Esumopas (&quot;Slave to Esus&quot;), and Esunertus (&quot;Having the power of Esus&quot;). Other personal names connected with Esus include Aesugesli, Esullus, and (on a British coin) √Üsus. Bernhard Maier is sceptical that all these names are theophoric.

Other Celtic names perhaps incorporating Esus include the tribe-name Esuvii (perhaps &quot;sons of Esus&quot;, from S√©es); the river-name Esino (in Italy); and the place-names Aesica (in Northumberland), Aeso (in Hispania Tarraconensis), and Ess√© (in Brittany).

==Lucan and the scholia==
===Lucan===
Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; or &quot;De Bello Civili&quot; (&quot;On the Civil War&quot;) is an epic poem, begun about 61 CE, on the events of Caesar&#x27;s civil war (49‚Äì48 BCE). The passage relevant to Esus occurs in &quot;Gallic excursus&quot;, an epic catalogue detailing the rejoicing of the various Gaulish peoples after Julius Caesar removed his legions from Gaul (where they were intended to control the natives) to Italy. The passage thus brings out two themes of Lucan&#x27;s work, the barbarity of the Gauls and the unpatriotism of Caesar.

The substance of the last few lines is this: unspecified Gauls, who made human sacrifices to their gods Teutates, Esus, and Taranis, were overjoyed by the exit of Caesar&#x27;s troops from their territory. The reference to &quot;Diana of the Scythians&quot; refers to the human sacrifices demanded by Diana at her temple in Scythian Taurica, well known in antiquity. That Lucan says little about these gods is not surprising. Lucan&#x27;s aims were poetic, and not historical or ethnographic. The poet never travelled to Gaul and relied on secondary sources for his knowledge of Gaulish religion. When he neglects to add more, this may well reflect the limits of his knowledge.

We have no literary sources prior to Lucan which mention these deities, and the few which mention them after Lucan (in the case of Esus, see below about Lactantius and Petronius) seem to borrow directly from this passage. The secondary sources on Celtic religion which Lucan relied on in this passage (perhaps Posidonius) have not come down to us. This passage is one of the very few in classical literature in which Celtic gods are mentioned under their native names, rather than identified with Greek or Roman gods. This departure from classical practice likely had poetic intent: emphasising the barbarity and exoticness the Gauls, whom Caesar had left to their own devices.

Some scholars, such as de Vries, have argued that the three gods mentioned together here (Esus, Teutates, and Taranis) formed a divine triad in ancient Gaulish religion. However, there is little other evidence associating these gods with each other. Other scholars, such as Graham Webster, emphasise that Lucan may as well have chosen these deity-names for their scansion and harsh sound.

===Scholia===
Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; was a very popular school text in late antiquity and the medieval period. This created a demand for commentaries and scholia dealing with difficulties in the work, both in grammar and subject matter. The earliest Lucan scholia that have come down to us are the &quot;Commenta Bernensia&quot; and the &quot;Adnotationes super Lucanum&quot;, both from manuscripts datable to the 10th and 11th centuries. Also important are comments from a Cologne codex (the &quot;Glossen ad Lucan&quot;), dating to the 11th and 12th centuries. In spite of their late date, these scholia are thought to incorporate very ancient material, some of it now lost. The &quot;Commenta&quot; and &quot;Adnotationes&quot; are known to contain material at least as old as Servius the Grammarian (4th century CE). Below are excerpts from these scholia relevant to Esus:

The first excerpt, about the sacrifice to Esus, comes from a passage in the &quot;Commenta&quot; which details the human sacrifices offered each of to the three gods (persons were drowned in barrels for Teutates, persons were burned in a wooden tub for Taranis). This passage, which is not paralleled anywhere else in classical literature, has been much the subject of much commentary. It seems to have been preserved in the &quot;Commenta&quot; by virtue of its author&#x27;s preference for factual (over grammatical) explanation. The &quot;Adnotationes&quot;, by comparison, tell us nothing about the sacrifices to Esus, Teutates, and Taranis beyond that they were each murderous. The nature of the sacrifice to Esus described here is unclear; the Latin text is cramped and ambiguous. Early Celticists relied on drastic emendations to the text, which have not been sustained in later scholarship. To give a few difficulties: here could refer to a process of decomposition or a violent severing of the limbs; means &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;raw meat&quot;, but also metaphorically &quot;murder&quot;; and , often read as suggesting that Esus&#x27;s victims were hanged by the neck from a tree, is perhaps nearer in meaning to saying that his victims were &quot;fixed to&quot; or &quot;suspended from a tree&quot;.

As a result of this ambiguity, a very large number of interpretations of the sacrificial ritual to Esus have been given. It has been pointed out that hanging by the neck does not result in loss of blood; and that neither of these lead to a dislocation of the limbs. Suggestions include that the victim was tied to the tree in order to be dismembered; or dismembered by means of tree branches; or injured and then suspended from the tree, by their armpits or limbs. This ritual has been compared with various legendary demises: the human sacrifices to Odin, the death of the mythological Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes, and the martyrdom of St Marcel de Chalon. The violent end of the bog body known as the Lindow Man‚Äîthroat slashed, strangled, bludgeoned, and drowned‚Äîhas even been connected with this sacrificial ritual.

All three commentaries offer the &quot;interpretatio romana&quot; of Esus as Mars (Roman god of war). The scholiast of the &quot;Commenta&quot;, however, notes that other sources give an &quot;interpretatio&quot; of Esus as Mercury, for which they offer a rationale: Esus, like Mercury, was worshipped by merchants. It is not possible to demonstrate the authenticity of either of these equations, as we have no source outside these commentaries which pairs the name of Esus with that of a Roman god. The evident confusion of the sources the scholiast had available to him has been taken to count against the evidentiary value of either of these &quot;interpretatios&quot;. regards the equation of Esus with Mercury as unlikely, because the Trier monument depicts Esus and Mercury next to each other, as different entities. However, a Mercury statue from Lezoux is sometimes believed to have an dedicatory inscription to Esus on its rear (discussed below), which may count in favour of the existence of such an &quot;interpretatio&quot;.

==Iconography==

The Pillar of the Boatmen is a Roman column erected in Lutetia (Roman Paris) in the time of Tiberius (i.e., 14-37 CE) by a company of sailors. It contains a number of depictions of Roman and Gaulish gods with legends identifying them. On one block of this pillar is an image identified as Esus (alongside Tarvos Trigaranus, and the Roman gods Jupiter and Vulcan). The image is of a bearded man in a tunic with a billhook in his left hand; he is aiming at a tree which he grasps with his right hand. The panel carrying the legend &quot;Tarvos Trigaranus&quot; (literally, &quot;Bull with three cranes&quot;) has foliage which continues over from Esus&#x27;s panel; it depicts a bull with two birds on its back and one between its horns.

A monument from Trier shows an arrangement very similar to the Paris monument. This monument, dedicated to Mercury by one Indus of the Mediomatrici, is a four-sided block with depictions of gods, much like the Paris monument. On one side is a depiction of Mercury and Rosmerta. On another side, a beardless man in a tunic attacks a tree; within the tree&#x27;s foliage, a bull&#x27;s head and three birds are visible. The similarity of iconography allow the beardless man to be identified with Esus. The monument has been dated to the early imperial period.

These two monuments seem to reveal a pictorial myth about Esus, involving a tree, a bull, and three cranes. The nature of this myth is unknown, but has given rise to much &quot;imaginative speculation&quot;. It is not clear whether Esus is engaged in felling or pruning the tree. The cultic significance which the Gauls attached to bulls is well attested, and Anne Ross has argued that there was such a significance associated with cranes, as well. de Vries conjectured that the panels represented a sacred enthronement ritual, with the felling of a sacred tree and slaughter of a bull. Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville connected these scenes with events in the mythology of the Irish warrior hero C√∫ Chulainn, however James MacKillop cautions that this suggestion &quot;now seems ill-founded&quot;.
Esus&#x27;s iconography confirms the importance of trees to his cult, otherwise suggested by the Lucan scholia. suggested that the tree Esus chops down on these monuments is the sacrificial tree. suggested that the of Esus&#x27;s cult may reflect the influence of Germanic religion (specifically the cult of Odin).

 has identified eight other images as of Esus. Marcel Le Glay (writing for the &quot;Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae&quot;) dismisses these identifications as &quot;uncertain&quot; and &quot;very random&quot;.

==Other attestations==
===Literary sources===
The Roman author Petronius names a minor character &quot;Hesus&quot; in his picaresque Latin novel &quot;Satyricon&quot; ( CE). There is nothing in what we know of Petronius that suggests he could have known about Gaulish religion first-hand. If this is a reference to the god Esus, it is probably (as Jean Gricourt suggests) Petronius using Lucan&#x27;s text to make a clever joke about the nature of this character.

Lactantius&#x27;s Christian apologia &quot;The Divine Institutes&quot; (), in discussing human sacrifice among the pagans, very briefly mentions Esus and Teutates as pagan gods to whom the Gauls sacrificed humans. It is almost universally agreed that Lactantius borrows from Lucan here. He is known to have read Lucan&#x27;s poem, and Lactantius&#x27;s testimony does not go beyond Lucan&#x27;s.

The Gaulish medical writer Marcellus of Bordeaux may offer a textual reference to Esus not dependent on Lucan in his &quot;De medicamentis&quot;, a compendium of pharmacological preparations written in Latin in the early 5th century which is the sole source for several Celtic words. The work contains a magico-medical charm, which and L√©on Fleuriot proposed was a Gaulish language invocation of the aid of Esus (spelled Aisus) in curing throat trouble. The text, however, is quite corrupt and the number of possible interpretations of it have led Alderik H. Blom and Andreas Hofeneder to scepticism that the god Esus is referenced here.

===Epigraphy===
The epigraphic evidence for Esus is very limited. There are only two only certain attestations of his name in epigraphy (the legend on the Paris monument and the inscription found in 1987) and a handful of conjectured ones. Philippe Leveau and Bernard Remy have suggested that this paucity of evidence may be explained by a Roman suppression of the cult of Esus, on the basis of its purported sacrificial practices.

In 1987, a metal detectorist discovered an inscribed bronze statuette base (the statuette missing) in Gurina (part of Roman Noricum, now Austria), where there was once a Gallo-Roman religious centre. It is a votive offering to Esus (spelled Aeso, dative of Aesos) made by an individual with a Celtic name. It dates to the end of the 1st century BCE, which makes it the earliest attestation of the god Esus.

A inscription on a fragment of a stele from the necropolis of Caesarea in Mauretania, a Roman city in Algeria, appears to record a votive inscription to Esus from one Peregrinus. The intervention of a Gaulish god in Africa is surprising, and the incomplete preservation of the inscription frustrates interpretation. Andreas Hofeneder witholds judgement as to whether it is an attestation of the Gaulish god. Leveau and Remy dedicate a study to this inscription, where they date it to the first half of the 1st century CE, and consider the possibility that Peregrinus was a Gaulish soldier in North Africa.

Two Gaulish language inscriptions have been conjectured to mention Esus. The well-known statue of Mercury from Lezoux has a badly weathered inscription on its rear. The text has received several different readings. Michel Lejeune will only allow to be read. John Rh≈∑s proposed to read Gaulish (&quot;Apronios dedicated this object to Esus&quot;). This reading has been the subject of repeated doubt and was later abandoned by Rh≈∑s himself. Another Gaulish inscription, on a terrine found near Lezoux, has an unclear initial word which Oswald Szemer√©nyi proposed to read . Pierre-Yves Lambert and Lejeune prefer (&quot;this&quot;).

<text>√âta√≠n or √âda√≠n (Modern Irish spelling: √âadaoin) is a figure of Irish mythology, best known as the heroine of &quot;Tochmarc √âta√≠ne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of √âta√≠n&quot;), one of the oldest and richest stories of the Mythological Cycle. She also figures in the Middle Irish &quot;Togail Bruidne D√° Derga&quot; (&quot;The Destruction of Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel&quot;). T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly identified her as a sun goddess.

==Name==
The name &quot;√âta√≠n&quot; () is alternately spelt as &quot;Edain&quot;, &quot;Aideen&quot;, &quot;Etaoin&quot;, &quot;√âadaoin&quot;, &quot;Aed√≠n&quot;, or &quot;Adaon&quot;. It is derived from a diminutive form of Old Irish &quot;√©t&quot;, &quot;passion, jealousy&quot;. She is sometimes known by the epithet Echraide (&quot;horse rider&quot;), suggesting links with horse deities and figures such as the Welsh Rhiannon and the Gaulish Epona. In &quot;Tochmarc √âta√≠ne&quot; Midir names her B√© Find (Fair Woman). However, the poem embedded in the text, &quot;A B√© Find in ragha lium&quot; may be an older, unrelated composition that was appended to the story later.

==Genealogy==
In &quot;Tochmarc √âtaine&quot;, √âta√≠n is the daughter of Ailill, king of the Ulaid. A slightly different genealogy is told in &quot;Togail Bruidne D√° Derga&quot; (&quot;The Destruction of Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel&quot;). Here she is the daughter of √âtar (described as king of the cavalcade of the elfmounds), and marries the High King Eochaid Feidlech. They have a daughter, called √âta√≠n √ìg (√âta√≠n the Younger), who marries Cormac, king of Ulster. She bears him a daughter, Mess Buachalla, but no sons. Cormac abandons Mess Buachalla, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman. When she grows up she marries the High King Etersc√©l and becomes the mother of Conaire Mor. In genealogical tracts she is said to have been the wife of the Ulster prince Cormac Cond Longas. Elsewhere √âta√≠n, called Eadon the poetess, appears to be a daughter of Dian C√©cht. Similarly, the Etain mentioned in the Second Battle of Moytura is the mother of Carpre the poet who satirizes and shames the Fomorians.

==&quot;Tochmarc √âtaine&quot;==
When Midir of the Tuatha D√© Danann falls in love with and marries √âta√≠n, Midir&#x27;s rejected first wife F√∫amnach becomes jealous and casts a series of spells on her. First F√∫amnach turns √âta√≠n into a pool of water, then into a worm, (in some versions a snake) and then into a beautiful scarlet fly. Midir does not know that the fly is √âta√≠n, but it becomes his constant companion, and he has no interest in women. F√∫amnach then creates a wind that blows the fly away and does not allow it to alight anywhere but the rocks of the sea for seven years.

Eventually it lands on the clothes of √ìengus, who recognises it as √âta√≠n, but he is at war with Midir and cannot return her to him. He makes her a little chamber with windows so she can come and go, and carries the chamber with him wherever he goes. But F√∫amnach hears of this and creates another wind which blows her away from him for another seven years. Eventually the fly falls into a glass of wine. The wine is swallowed (together with the fly) by the wife of √âtar, an Ulster chieftain, in the time of Conchobar mac Nessa. She becomes pregnant, and √âtain is reborn, one thousand and twelve years after her first birth. Many modern readers of &quot;The Wooing of Etaine&quot; assume that &quot;fly&quot; must mean butterfly or dragonfly, but the Irish word clearly translates as fly (or beetle). Since there are both butterflies and dragonflies in Ireland and specific Irish words for both, it is clear that the creature she becomes is actually a fly.

When she grows up, √âta√≠n marries the High King, Eochaid Airem. Their meeting is related in the opening episode of &quot;Togail Bruidne D√° Derga&quot;. Eochaid&#x27;s brother Ailill Angubae falls in love with her, and begins to waste away. Eventually he admits to √âta√≠n that he is dying of love for her, and she agrees to sleep with him to save his life. They arrange to meet, but Midir casts a spell which causes Ailill to fall asleep and miss the assignation. However, √âta√≠n meets a man there who looks and speaks like Ailill but does not sleep with him because she senses that it is not actually him. This happens three times, and the man who looks like Ailill reveals himself to be Midir, and tells her of her previous life as his wife. She refuses to leave with him unless her husband gives her permission. She then returns to Ailill to find him cured.

Midir then goes to Eochaid in his true form and asks to play &quot;fidchell&quot;, a board game, with him. He offers a stake of fifty horses, loses, and gives Eochaid the horses as promised. Midir challenges him to more games, for higher stakes, and keeps losing. Eochaid, warned by his foster-father that Midir is a being of great power, sets him a series of tasks, including laying a causeway over M√≥in L√°mrige, which he performs reluctantly. He then challenges Eochaid to one final game of &quot;fidchell&quot;, the stake to be named by the winner. This time, Midir wins, and demands an embrace and a kiss from √âta√≠n. Eochaid agrees that he will have it if he returns in a month&#x27;s time. A month later Midir returns. He puts his arms around √âta√≠n, and they turn into swans and fly off.

Eochaid and his men begin digging at the mound of Br√≠ L√©ith where Midir lives. Midir appears to them and tells Eochaid his wife will be restored to him the following day. The next day fifty women who all look like √âtain appear, and an old hag tells Eochaid to choose which one is his wife. He chooses one, but Midir later reveals that √âta√≠n had been pregnant when he had taken her, and the girl he has chosen is her daughter. Eochaid is horrified, because he has slept with his own daughter, who became pregnant with a girl. When the girl is born she is exposed, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman and his wife. She later becomes the mother of the High King Conaire Mor.

==Dindsenchas==

Two episodes from the &quot;Tochmarc √âta√≠ne&quot; are also recounted in the metrical Dindsenchas. The Dindsenchas poem on Rath Esa recounts how Eochaid Airenn won back √âta√≠n. The poem on R√°th Cr√∫achan refers to Midir&#x27;s abduction of √âta√≠n.

==&quot;Togail Bruidne D√° Derga&quot;==

The Middle Irish text &quot;Togail Bruidne D√° Derga&quot; (Recension II) includes a rather lengthy and colourful depiction of her in the episode of her encounter with King Echu in Br√≠ L√©ith:

&quot;[...] con-accai in mna√≠ for ur in tobair &amp; c√≠r chuirr√©l argit co n-ecor de √≥r acthe oc folcud a l-luing argit &amp; ceithri h-e√≥in √≥ir furri &amp; gleorgemai beccai di charrmogul chorcrai h-i forfleascuib na luingi . Brat cas corcra fo lo√≠ cha√≠n aicthe . D√∫alldai airgdidi ecoirside de √≥r oibinniu isin bratt . L√©ne lebur-chulpatach is√≠ chotutlemon dei s√≠tiu √∫ainide fo derginliud √≥ir impi. T√∫agm√≠la ingantai di √≥r &amp; airget fora bruindi &amp; a formnaib &amp; a g√∫allib isind l√©ne di cach leith. Taitned fria in gr√≠an co b-ba forderg dona feraib tu√≠dhleach ind √≥ir frisin n- gr√©in asin t√≠tiu uainidi. D√° trilis n- √≥rbuidi fora cind . Fige ceithri n-d√∫al ceachtar n-d√©, &amp; mell for rind cach d√∫ail. Ba cosmail le√≥ dath ind foiltsin fri barr n-ailestair h-i samrad n√≥ fri derg√≥r √≠ar n- d√©nam a datha.&quot;

&quot;[...] [Echu] saw a woman at the edge of the well. She had a bright silver comb with gold ornamentation on it, and she was washing from a silver vessel with four gold birds on it and bright, tiny gems of crimson carbuncle on its rims. There was a crimson cloak of beautiful, curly fleece round her, fastened with a silver brooch coiled with lovely gold; her long-hooded tunic was of stiff, smooth, green silk embroidered with red gold, and there were wondrous animal brooches of gold and silver at her breast and on her shoulders. When the sun shone upon her, the gold would glisten very red against the green silk. Two tresses of yellow gold she had, and each tress was a weaving of four twists with a globe at the end. Men would say that hair was like the blooming iris in summer or like red gold after it had been burnished.&quot;
In equally rapturous style, the narrator proceeds to home in on her physical beauty:

&quot;Is and bu√≠ oc taithbiuch a fuilt dia folcud &amp; a d√° l√°im tria derc a sedlaig immach. Batar gilithir sneachta n-oenaichde na d√≠ d√≥it &amp; batar maethch√≥iri &amp; batar dergithir s√≠an sl√©be na d√° gr√∫ad n-glan√°illi. Badar duibithir druimne daeil na d√° malaich .

Ba fria as-breth: cruth c√°ch co h-√âta√≠n. Caem c√°ch co h-√âta√≠n.&quot;

&quot;At the well, the woman loosened her hair in order to wash it, and her hands appeared through the opening of the neck of her dress. As white as the snow of a single night her wrists; as tender and even and red as foxglove her clear, lovely cheeks. As black as a beetle&#x27;s back her brows; a shower of matched pearls her teeth. Hyacinth blue her eyes; Parthian red her lips. Straight, smooth, soft and white her shoulders; pure white and tapering her fingers; long her arms. As white as sea foam her side, slender, long, smooth, yielding, soft as wool. Warm and smooth, sleek and white her thighs; round and small, firm and white her knees. Short and white and straight her shins; fine and straight and lovely her heels. If a rule were put against her feet, scarcely a fault would be found save for her plenitude of flesh or skin. The blushing light of the moon in her noble face; an uplifting of pride in her smooth brows; a gleam of courting each in her two royal eyes. Dimples of pleasure each of her cheeks, where spots red as the blood of a calf alternated with spots the whiteness of shining snow. A gently, womanly dignity in her voice; a steady, stately step, the walk of a queen. She was the fairest and most perfect and most beautiful of all the women in the world; men thought she was of the S√≠de, and they said of her: &#x27;Lovely anyone until √âtain. Beautiful anyone until √âtain.
===Silver basin===
The silver basin (Ir. &quot;long&quot;) with the four golden birds around it may have symbolic or religious significance. Margaret Dobbs has noted the parallel of the three cups offered by Medb to the Ulster heroes in &quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot;. Each of these three cups had a bird of greater material value placed on the inside: the bronze cup was fitted out with a bird of &quot;findruine&quot;, the &quot;findruine&quot; one with a bird of gold and the gold cup with a bird of gems. Moreover, she points out a possible relationship to examples of late Hallstatt pottery and bronzeware from Central Europe in which figures of aquatic birds were attached to bowls or vases, whether they were specifically designed for religious ceremonies or conveyed religious ideas in more general contexts. She suggests that the literary image may preserve &quot;a memory of well-worship and of rites performed there with sacred vessels marked with magic symbols&quot;, possibly against evil magic. Such religious practices and ritual vessels may have reached Ireland between about 600 and 300 BC, when immigration took place in Britain and Ireland. In the light of the sacred significance of swans in early Irish literature, Dobbs also notes the episode&#x27;s possible relevance to F√∫amnach&#x27;s malevolent spells and √âta√≠n&#x27;s and Midir&#x27;s transformation into the shape of swans.

Aideen&#x27;s Grave is a megalithic portal tomb located in Binn √âadair, according to legend this was her final resting place. This legend is the subject of the poem &#x27;Aideen&#x27;s Grave&#x27; by Samuel Ferguson.

<text>Fand (&quot;tear&quot;, &quot;teardrop of beauty&quot;) or Fann (&quot;weak, helpless person&#x27;&quot;) is an otherworldly woman in Irish mythology. The two forms of her name are not phonetic variants, but two different words of different meaning and the history of her name is debated.

==Appearance in &quot;Serglige Con Culainn&quot;==
Fand appears most prominently in the Ulster Cycle tale, &quot;Serglige Con Culainn&quot; (&quot;The Sickbed of C√∫chulainn&quot;) as the daughter of √Åed Abrat, sister of L√≠ Ban and one Angus, and wife of Manann√°n.

She enters the story in the form of an otherworldly sea bird. In her sea bird form, she flies with a flock of enchanted birds, with each pair joined together by a silver chain. Fand, flying with her sister L√≠ Ban, stands out from the rest as they are connected by a gold chain.

The hero C√∫chulainn hurls stones at the seabirds, one of which passes through Fand&#x27;s wing feathers. Later, Fand and L√≠ Ban return in the form of &quot;Otherworldly women&quot; and confront him on the shore of the lake. They beat C√∫chulainn with horsewhips until he falls ill and lies abed for a year, unable to rise.

C√∫chulainn eventually regains his health by the favor of Fand when, via negotiators (L√≠ Ban, and C√∫chulainn&#x27;s charioteer, L√°eg), C√∫chulainn reluctantly agrees to travel to the Fand&#x27;s otherworld island and help her in a battle against her foes. C√∫chulainn and Fand then become lovers.

The relationship does not last, as C√∫chulainn&#x27;s wife, Emer is very jealous and comes to attack the couple with a troop of women armed with knives. Fand sees that Emer is worthy of C√∫chulainn, and obviously upset by their affair, so Fand chooses to leave him. She chants a poem, and then returns to her husband Manann√°n, who shakes his magical cloak of mists between Fand and C√∫chulainn, that they may never meet again. C√∫chulainn and Emer then drink a drink of forgetfulness, provided by the druids.

==Other appearances in early literature==
According to MacKillop, &quot;her mother is sometimes given as Flidais, the woodland deity. In variant texts she is described as the wife of Eochaid I√∫il, one of Labraid&#x27;s enemies vanquished by C√∫chulainn&quot;.

The goddess or otherworldly woman, Niamh of the Golden Hair, is said to be a daughter of Manann√°n. As Niamh and Fand share some of the same characteristics, it is possible Niamh is also the daughter of Fand. Some sources mention another possible daughter of Manann√°n, Cliodna, but as Manann√°n is known to have partnered with a number of goddesses and mortal women, her connection with Fand is unclear.

==Appearances in modern literature==
Fand inspired William Larminie&#x27;s &quot;Fand and Other Poems&quot; (Dublin, 1892) and Arnold Bax&#x27;s tone poem &quot;The Garden of Fand&quot; (1916).

Fand has also appeared as a recurring character in Kevin Hearne&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Druid Chronicles&quot; series.

<text>L√≠ Ban (; thus &#x27;paragon of women&#x27;) may refer to an otherworldly female figure in Irish mythology.

This L√≠ Ban claimed the beautiful Fand as sister, and was wife to Labraid Luathl√°m ar Claideb (&quot;Labraid of the swift sword-hand&quot;), the ruler of Magh Mell.

She appears primarily in the Irish tale of &quot;Serglige Con Culainn&quot; (&quot;The Wasting Sickness of C√∫ Chulainn&quot;), where she is the daughter of √Åed Abrat. She appears first in the form of a sea bird, then as an otherworldly woman who inflicts the story&#x27;s eponymous sickness on C√∫ Chulainn. In the story L√≠ Ban acts as messenger and mediator; she and C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s charioteer L√°eg work together to see that C√∫ Chulainn is healed in exchange for his aid in Fand&#x27;s battle in the Otherworld.

From this L√≠ Ban may have derived her namesake, a legendary L√≠ Ban of Lough Neagh.

<text>Ferdiad (; also &quot;Fer Diad&quot;, &quot;Ferdia&quot;, &quot;Fear Diadh&quot;), son of Dam√°n, son of D√°ire, of the Fir Domnann, is a warrior of Connacht in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. In the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;, Ferdiad finds himself on the side of the war opposite to that taken by his best friend and foster-brother C√∫ Chulainn, with whom he had trained in arms under the renowned warrior woman Sc√°thach. He and C√∫ Chulainn are equal in all martial feats, with two exceptions: the &quot;G√°e Bulg&quot;, a barbed spear which Sc√°thach has taught only C√∫ Chulainn to use; and Ferdiad&#x27;s horn skin, which no weapon can pierce.

When Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, invade Ulster to steal the bull Donn C√∫ailnge, their progress is held up by C√∫ Chulainn, who demands single combat. After C√∫ Chulainn has defeated a series of Connacht champions, Medb sends for Ferdiad, but he only agrees to fight C√∫ Chulainn after Findabair, Ailill and Medb&#x27;s daughter, has seductively plied him with alcohol, and Medb has variously bribed, shamed and goaded him to do so. They fight in the ford for three days, first fighting with eight swords, darts, and spears, then fighting with &quot;throwing-spears&quot; and lances, and finally moving on to &quot;heavy, hard-smiting swords.&quot; It is on the third day that Ferdiad starts to gain the upper hand. At this point, C√∫ Chulainn calls to his charioteer, Laeg, for the &quot;G√°e Bolga&quot;, which he floats down the river to him. C√∫ Chulainn throws a light spear at Ferdiad&#x27;s chest, causing him to raise his shield, and then picks up the &quot;G√°e Bolga&quot; between his toes and thrusts it through his anus, upon which the barbs spread throughout his body, killing him. The &quot;G√°e Bolga&quot; is then removed from Ferdiad&#x27;s body by Laeg, and C√∫ Chulainn mourns Ferdiad&#x27;s death, praising his strength and bravery:

:&quot;Ah, Ferdiad, betrayed to death.&quot;
:&quot;Our last meeting, oh, how sad!&quot;
:&quot;Thou to die I to remain.&quot;
:&quot;Ever sad our long farewell!&quot;

Scholars believe that the fight between C√∫ Chulainn and Ferdiad is a late addition to the &quot;T√°in&quot;, originating not earlier than the eleventh century and drawing on earlier episodes in the story.

Ferdiad&#x27;s name has been interpreted as meaning &quot;man of smoke&quot;, &quot;man of the pair&quot; or &quot;man of two feet&quot;, and may be a back-formation from the placename &quot;√Åth Fhir Diad&quot; (Ardee, County Louth) which is supposedly named after him.

== Legacy ==

The ford on which he died is named &quot;√Åth Fhirdiad&quot; (Ferdiad&#x27;s ford in Irish) Ardee, County Louth is named after him (&quot;Baile √Åtha Fhirdhia&quot;).

A bronze statue stands in Bridge Street, Ardee depicting the battle and the death of Ferdiad.

<text>Maeve, Meave, Maev or Maiv ( ) is a female given name of Irish origin. It comes from the Irish name &quot;M√©abh&quot;, which was spelt in Early Modern Irish (), or in Middle Irish, and in Old Irish (). It may derive from a word meaning &quot;she who intoxicates&quot;, &quot;mead-woman&quot;, or alternatively &quot;she who rules&quot;. Medb is a queen in Irish mythology who is thought to have originally been a sovereignty goddess.

==Usage==
Maeve (in that spelling) was a Top 100 girls&#x27; name in Ireland for all but 12 of the 46 years between 1964 and 2009, and Meabh ranked 99th on the list of the most popular Irish girls&#x27; names of 2020.

<text>In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, Culann was a smith whose house was protected by a ferocious watchdog. Culann&#x27;s hound was a pup of Celtchar&#x27;s hound Dael, and he was found in the skull of Conganchnes mac Dedad along with two other pups (Celtchar and Mac da Tho&#x27;s hounds); Culann&#x27;s hound was speckled, while Celtchar and Mac da Tho&#x27;s hounds were black and grey, respectively.

Culann invited Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and his retinue to a feast at his house. On the way Conchobar saw his young nephew S√©tanta playing hurling, and was so impressed he invited the boy to join him at the feast. S√©tanta told him he would catch up once the game was over.

The feast got underway, and Culann asked Conchobar if he was expecting anyone else. Conchobar, who had forgotten about S√©tanta, answered no, and Culann unleashed his watchdog. When S√©tanta arrived he was forced to kill the dog in self-defence, and out of obligation offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. For this he was renamed &quot;C√∫ Chulainn&quot; ‚Äì &quot;Culann&#x27;s hound&quot;.

<text>Sc√°thach () or Sg√†thach () is a figure in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. She is a legendary Scottish warrior woman and martial arts teacher who trains the legendary Ulster hero C√∫ Chulainn in the arts of combat. Texts describe her homeland as Scotland (&quot;Alpeach&quot;); she is especially associated with the Isle of Skye, where her residence &quot;D√∫n Sc√°ith&quot; (&quot;Fortress of Shadows&quot;) stands. She is called &quot;the Shadow&quot; and &quot;Warrior Maid&quot; and is the rival and sister of A√≠fe, both of whom are daughters of √Ård-Greimne of Lethra.

==Appearances==
Sc√°thach&#x27;s instruction of the young hero C√∫ Chulainn notably appears in &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Emer&quot;), an early Irish foretale to the great epic &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;. Here, C√∫ Chulainn is honour-bound to perform a number of tasks before he is found worthy to marry his beloved Emer, daughter of the chieftain Forgall Monach. The tale survives in two recensions: a short version written mainly in Old Irish and a later, expanded version of the Middle Irish period. In both recensions, C√∫ Chulainn is sent to &quot;Alpae&quot;, a term literally meaning &quot;the Alps&quot;, but apparently used here to refer to Scotland (otherwise &quot;Albu&quot; in Irish). C√∫ Chulainn is sent there with L√≥egaire and Conchobor, and in the later version also with Conall Cernach, to receive training from the warrior Domnall (whose hideous daughter falls in love with the hero and, after being spurned by him, later exacts her revenge by separating him from his companions by means of a magical illusion). After some time, Domnall assigns them to the care of Sc√°thach for further training.

C√∫ Chulainn and his companion Ferdiad travel to D√∫n Sc√°ith, where Sc√°thach teaches them feats of arms, and gives C√∫ Chulainn a deadly spear, the G√°e Bulg. C√∫ Chulainn begins an affair with Sc√°thach&#x27;s daughter Uathach, but accidentally breaks her fingers. She screams, calling her lover Cochar Croibhe to the room. Despite Uathach&#x27;s protests, he challenges C√∫ Chulainn to a duel, and C√∫ Chulainn dispatches him easily. To make it up to Uathach and Sc√°thach, C√∫ Chulainn assumes Cochar&#x27;s duties, and becomes Uathach&#x27;s lover. Sc√°thach eventually promises her daughter to him, without requiring the traditional bride price. When her rival, the warrior woman A√≠fe, threatens her territory, C√∫ Chulainn battles A√≠fe, and manages to defeat her through distracting her with lies. With his sword at her throat, he bargains with her that he will spare her life under the conditions that she will cease her conflicts with Sc√°thach, and that she will allow him to impregnate her so that she will bear him a son. This leaves A√≠fe pregnant with his son Connla, whom C√∫ Chulainn kills years later ‚Äî only realizing who Connla is after he has slain him.

<doc id="86490" wikidata="Q387800" url="?curid=86490" title="Fergus mac R√≥ich">
<text>Fergus mac R√≥ich/R√≥igh (literally &quot;manliness, son of great stallion&quot;) is an Irish hero and a character in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Formerly the king of Ulster, he is tricked out of the kingship and betrayed by Conchobar mac Nessa, becomes the ally and lover of Conchobar&#x27;s enemy, queen Medb of Connacht, and joins her expedition against Ulster in the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;. Fergus is described as being of huge size and sexual potency. This leads him into many a precarious situation as in the story of the &quot;T√°in B√≥ Flidhais&quot;.

==King of Ulster==
Fergus becomes king of Ulster after his predecessor, Eochaid S√°lbuide, is killed, along with the High King Fachtna F√°thach, by Eochu Feidlech in the Battle of Leitir Ruad. While king, he desires Eochaid S√°lbuide&#x27;s daughter Ness, but she will only consent to marry him if he allows her son Conchobar to be king for a year, so his sons will be the sons of a king. The nobles of Ulster reassure him that the boy will be king in name only, so Fergus agrees, but Conchobar, with his mother&#x27;s help, rules so wisely that the nobles make him king permanently in Fergus&#x27;s place. Fergus remains Conchobar&#x27;s loyal retainer, and becomes the foster-father of Conchobar&#x27;s eldest son Cormac Cond Longas and nephew C√∫chulainn.

==Fergus&#x27; exile==
Conchobar&#x27;s intended bride, Deirdre, elopes with the young warrior Naoise and his two brothers, and after some time of wandering they are tracked down to an island off Scotland. Conchobar announces he has forgiven them and sends Fergus, Cormac, Dubthach D√≥eltenga, and Fergus&#x27; son F√≠achu, to offer them safe conduct home. Naoise and his brothers swear they will eat no food until they dine with Conchobar at Emain Macha. Conchobar, however, orders the Ulstermen to invite Fergus, Cormac and Dubthach to feasts, and, as it is shameful to refuse hospitality, Fergus is separated from his charges, and F√≠achu is left to escort them to Emain alone. When they arrive, F√≠achu, Naoise and his brothers are murdered by √âogan mac Durthacht, a former enemy of Conchobar who has recently made peace with him. After hearing of this betrayal, Fergus, Cormac and Dubthach burn Emain Macha and defect to Connacht with three thousand followers, where they enter the service of king Ailill mac M√°ta and queen Medb. Conchobar forcibly marries Deirdre, who later commits suicide after he offers her to √âogan.

==T√°in B√≥ Flidhais==
Flidais, wife of Ailill Finn, a petty king of the Erris district of Connacht, falls in love with Fergus from afar. In T√°in B√≥ Flidhais Fergus and Dubthach visit Ailill Finn, claiming to have fallen out with Ailill mac M√°ta and Medb, and provoke him to battle. However, he proves difficult to defeat, beating Dubthach in single combat and holding out against a siege of his stronghold. Fergus is only able to defeat him when Ailill arrives with the army of Connacht. After that, Fergus marries Flidais. It is said that unless he could have Flidais, it took seven women to satisfy him. He also becomes Medb&#x27;s lover, and she is said to have needed thirty men to satisfy her if she couldn&#x27;t have Fergus.

==T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge==
When Ailill and Medb raise a huge army and launch the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley) to steal Ulster&#x27;s stud bull, Donn C√∫ailnge, Fergus&#x27; knowledge of the terrain means he is chosen to lead the way. He leads the army by a roundabout route, hoping to give the Ulstermen time to raise their own army, but they are disabled by a curse. He sends a message to C√∫chulainn, who begins his single-handed defence of the province.

The Connacht army separates, with Ailill leading one section, and Medb and Fergus leading the other. Ailill is suspicious, and sends his charioteer to spy on them. The charioteer finds Fergus and Medb having sex, and unnoticed, steals Fergus&#x27; sword, which Ailill keeps safe as proof. Fergus makes himself a dummy sword of wood to hide his loss. C√∫chulainn holds up the army&#x27;s progress by fighting a series of champions in single combat. Fergus is sent to face him, but as foster-father and foster-son, neither wants to fight the other, and in any case Fergus has no sword. C√∫chulainn agrees to yield on this occasion, on the condition that Fergus yields the next time they meet.

Eventually the Ulstermen recover from their curse, and the final battle begins. Ailill gives Fergus back his sword. Fergus meets Conchobar on the battlefield, and has him at his mercy, but is prevented from killing him by Cormac. He redirects his rage into cutting off the tops of three hills with his sword. C√∫chulainn, who has so far sat out the battle, recuperating from his wounds, enters the fray and challenges Fergus. Fergus honours his promise and yields, pulling his followers from the field. Medb&#x27;s other allies, seeing him withdraw, panic and begin to retreat. The Connacht army is routed, and Fergus bitterly remarks, &quot;It is the usual thing for a herd led by a mare to be strayed and destroyed.&quot;

==Decline and death==
After the death of Conchobar, some of the Ulstermen propose inviting him home to be their king, but they ultimately decide to appoint Cormac, Conchobar&#x27;s son and Fergus&#x27; foster-son, who is also in exile in Connacht. Cormac promises to remain friendly with Ailill and Medb, and sets out for Ulster. Fergus remains in Cruachan. On his journey, Cormac discovers a Connacht war-party raiding Ulster, and Cormac reluctantly attacks and defeats them. Word gets back to Medb, who sends her army after him, while keeping Fergus occupied. Eventually he hears what is happening and sets off in his chariot, but arrives too late ‚Äì Cormac is already dead.

One day, after Fergus has been in exile for fourteen years, Ailill sees him swimming in a lake with Medb, and is overcome with jealousy. He tells his brother, Lugaid Dalleces, who is blind, that deer are playing in the water, and persuades him to throw a spear at them. He does so, and the spear hits Fergus in the chest. He climbs out of the water and throws the spear back, killing Ailill&#x27;s deer-hound, before dying. His death-tale relates that he had killed √âogan mac Durthacht, but this story is lost.

==Other legends==
The story is told that, in the 6th century, the poet Sench√°n Torp√©ist gathered the poets of Ireland together to see if any of them knew the story of the &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;, but they all only knew parts of it. His son Muirgen came to Fergus&#x27; grave and spoke a poem, and Fergus&#x27; ghost appeared to him and related the events of the &quot;T√°in&quot; as they happened.

Another legendary Ulster king, Fergus mac L√©ti, is regarded as a double of Fergus mac R√≥ich: both die in water, and are associated with the sword Caladbolg. Another legendary Fergus, Fergus Foga of the Corcu √ìchae of Munster, is identified with Fergus mac R√≥ich by T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly.
==Issue==
The Ciarraige, an early medieval people who gave their name to County Kerry, traced their ancestry to Ciar, a son of Fergus and Medb, as do the Conmha√≠cne of Leitrim, Sligo, and Galway, through Conmac. The Masraige, a tribe inhabiting Magh Sl√©cht in County Cavan were descended from Fergus according to Corpus Genealogiarum Hiberniae, 1 16r A44, 279. According to &quot;The Stem of the Irish Nation&quot; by John O&#x27;Hart, Fergus had the following triplets with Medb;

* Conmac mac Fergus
* Ciar mac Fergus
* Corc mac Fergus

Other issue attributed to Fergus by O&#x27;Hart includes;

* Dallan mac Fergus
* Anluim mac Fergus
* Conri mac Fergus
* Aongus Fionn mac Fergus
* Oiliol mac Fergus
* Firceighid mac Fergus
* Uiter mac Fergus
* Finfailig mac Fergus
* Firtleachta mac Fergus
* Binne mac Fergus

<text>The Red Branch (; alternatively, ) is the name of two of the three royal houses of the king of Ulster, Conchobar mac Nessa, at his capital Emain Macha (Navan Fort, near Armagh), in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. In modern retellings it is sometimes used as the name of an order of warriors, the Red Branch Knights.

The names of two of Conchobar&#x27;s houses can be translated as &quot;Red Branch&quot;, as Old Irish had two words for &quot;red&quot;: &quot;derg&quot;, bright red, the colour of fresh blood, flame or gold; and &quot;ruad&quot;, russet, used for the colour of red hair. The &quot;Cr√≥eb Ruad&quot; (modern Irish &quot;Craobh Rua&quot;, &quot;russet branch&quot;) was where the king sat; its name has survived as the townland of Creeveroe in County Armagh. The &quot;Cr√≥eb Derg&quot; (modern Irish &quot;Craobh Dhearg&quot;, &quot;blood red branch&quot;) was where severed heads and other trophies of battle were kept. His third house was called the &quot;T√©ite Brec&quot; or &quot;speckled hoard&quot;, where the heroes&#x27; weapons were stored.

==Modern usage==
*The name &quot;Red Branch Knights&quot; was used by a loyalist paramilitary group from Northern Ireland in September 1992 to claim responsibility for incendiary devices and a blast bomb left in a Dublin-based bank in Newtownabbey. Statements were sent to the media threatening action against anyone with political or economic links with the Republic of Ireland. They are not known to have been responsible for any casualties during the Troubles.
*A Belfast Celtic group also goes by the name &quot;Craobh Rua&quot;.
*The name &quot;Knights of the Red Branch&quot; was also used by an Irish Catholic fraternal organization in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and San Francisco, California in the 19th and early to mid 20th centuries. The society was originally a patriotic and military organization in Ireland but functioned as a fraternal and beneficial society in America in the early 20th Century.

<doc id="86493" wikidata="Q1001099" url="?curid=86493" title="Fianna">
<text>Fianna ( , ; singular Fian; ) were small warrior-hunter bands in Gaelic Ireland during the Iron Age and early Middle Ages. A &quot;fian&quot; was made up of freeborn young men, often from the Gaelic nobility of Ireland, &quot;who had left fosterage but had not yet inherited the property needed to settle down as full landowning members of the &quot;t√∫ath&quot;&quot;. For most of the year they lived in the wild, hunting, cattle raiding other Irish clans, training, and fighting as mercenaries. Scholars believe the &quot;fian&quot; was a rite of passage into manhood, and have linked &quot;fianna&quot; with similar young warrior bands in other early European cultures.

They are featured in a body of Irish legends known as the &#x27;Fianna Cycle&#x27; or &#x27;Fenian Cycle&#x27;, which focuses on the adventures and heroic deeds of the &quot;fian&quot; leader Fionn mac Cumhaill and his band. In later tales, the &quot;fianna&quot; are more often depicted as household troops of the High Kings.

The Fenian Brotherhood of the 19th-century and the &quot;Fianna √âireann&quot;, an Irish nationalist youth organisation of the 20th century, are named after them.

==Historicity==
The historical institution of the &quot;f√≠an&quot; is known from references in early medieval Irish law tracts. A &quot;f√≠an&quot; (plural &quot;f√≠ana&quot; or &quot;fianna&quot;) was a small band of roving hunter-warriors. It was made up of landless young men of free birth, often young aristocrats, &quot;who had left fosterage but had not yet inherited the property needed to settle down as full landowning members of the &quot;t√∫ath&quot;&quot;. A member of a &quot;f√≠an&quot; was called a &quot;f√©nnid&quot;; the leader of a &quot;f√≠an&quot; was a &quot;r√≠gf√©nnid&quot; (literally &quot;king-&quot;f√©nnid&quot;&quot;). The &quot;f√≠an&quot; way of life was called &quot;f√≠anaigecht&quot; and involved living in the wild, hunting, raiding, martial and athletic training, and even training in poetry. They also served as mercenaries. Wild animals, particularly the wolf and the deer, seem to have been &quot;f√≠an&quot; mascots. Some sources associate &quot;fianna&quot; with the outdoor cooking pits known as &quot;fulacht fiadh&quot;.

Many of the first mentions of &quot;fianna&quot; are connected with &quot;Scoti&quot; raids in Britain during the end of the Roman rule.

Geoffrey Keating, in his 17th-century &quot;History of Ireland&quot;, says that during the winter the &quot;fianna&quot; were quartered and fed by the nobility, during which time they would keep order on their behalf, but during the summer/autumn, from Beltaine to Samhain, they were obliged to live by hunting for food and for pelts to sell. Keating&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; is more a compilation of traditions than a reliable history, but in this case scholars point to references in early Irish literature and the existence of a closed hunting season for deer and wild boar between Samhain and Beltaine in medieval Scotland as corroboration. Hubert Thomas Knox (1908) likened the &quot;fianna&quot; to &quot;bodies of Gallowglasses such as appeared in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but then under command of adventurers who were not inhabitants of the province, Free Companies who sold their services to any one who could raise their wages&quot;.

Joseph Nagy writes that the &quot;f√≠an&quot; seemingly &quot;served a vital function in siphoning off undesirable elements [...] providing an outlet for rambunctious behaviour&quot;, and was a rite of passage that prepared young men for adult life. Katharine Simms writes that &quot;While most members eventually inherited land, married and settled down, some passed their lives as professional champions, employed by the rest of the population to avenge their wrongs, collect debts, enforce order at feasts and so forth&quot;.

The &quot;f√≠an&quot; was a tolerated institution in early Irish secular society, and secular literature continued to endorse it down to the 12th century. However, the institution was not favoured by the church, and it is likely the church was key in the demise of the &quot;f√≠an&quot;. Churchmen sometimes referred to them as &quot;d√≠berga&quot; (which came to mean &#x27;marauders&#x27;) and &quot;maicc b√°is&quot; (&#x27;sons of death&#x27;), and several hagiographies tell of saints converting them from their &quot;non-Christian and destructive ways&quot;.

They are described as having a &quot;c√∫l√°n&quot; hairstyle: long at the back, with the scalp partly shaved. Some are also described as having strange or &#x27;devilish&#x27; marks on their head; this has been taken to mean tattoos.

===Origins===
Scholars have linked the &quot;fianna&quot; with similar young warrior bands in other early European cultures, and suggest they all derive from the *&quot;k√≥ryos&quot; which is thought to have existed in Proto-Indo-European society.

Linguist Ranko Matasoviƒá, author of the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic&quot;, derives the name &quot;f√≠ana&quot; from reconstructed Proto-Celtic &quot;*wƒìnƒÅ&quot; (a troop), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*weyh&quot; (to chase, pursue), and says the Irish ethnic name &quot;F√©ni&quot; is probably related. Kim McCone derives it from Proto-Celtic &quot;*wƒìnnƒÅ&quot; &lt; &quot;*wƒìd-nƒÅ&quot; (wild ones).

Heinrich Zimmer (1891), however, suggested that the &quot;fianna&quot; tales come from the heritage of the Norse-Gaels. He derived the name &quot;fianna&quot; from an Irish rendering of Old Norse &quot;fiandr&quot; &quot;enemies&quot; &gt; &quot;brave enemies&quot; &gt; &quot;brave warriors&quot;. He also noted Fionn&#x27;s Thumb of Knowledge is similar to the Norse tale of Sigur√∞r tasting F√°fnir&#x27;s heart.

==Legendary depiction==
The &quot;fianna&quot; are the focus of a body of Irish legends known as the &quot;F√≠anaigecht&quot;, &#x27;Fianna Cycle&#x27; or &#x27;Fenian Cycle&#x27;. Most are about the adventures and heroic deeds of Finn (or Fionn) mac Cumhaill and his &quot;f√≠an&quot; members.

In earlier tales, the various &quot;fianna&quot; groups are depicted as roving hunter-warriors, and there are many pagan and magical elements. Later tales focus on Fionn and his companions, and the &quot;fianna&quot; are more often depicted as household troops of the High Kings. These later tales usually depict the &quot;fianna&quot; as one group with two factions: the Clann Ba√≠scne of Leinster, led by Fionn, and the Clann Morna of Connacht, led by Goll mac Morna.

Some legendary depictions of &quot;fianna&quot; seem to conform to historical reality: for example, in the Ulster Cycle the druid Cathbad leads a &quot;fian&quot; of 27 men which fights against other &quot;fianna&quot; and kills the 12 foster-fathers of the Ulster princess Ness. In response, Ness leads her own &quot;fian&quot; of 27 in pursuit of Cathbad.

===War cry and mottos===
The &quot;Dord Fian&quot; or &quot;Dord Fiansa&quot; was the war-cry of the &quot;Fianna&quot;, and they often sounded it before and amid battle, either as a mode of communication or to put fear into their enemies. In the legend &quot;The Death of Fionn&quot;, Fionn raises the &quot;Dord Fian&quot; when he sees his grandson Oscar fall in the &quot;Battle of Gabhra&quot; against the armies of Cairbre Lifechair, and proceeds to strike back at the enemy with great fury, killing many dozens of warriors. The &quot;Battle of Gabhra&quot; also marked the demise of the Fianna.

They had three mottoes:
*&quot;Glaine √°r gcro√≠&quot; (Purity of our hearts)
*&quot;Neart √°r ng√©ag&quot; (Strength of our limbs)
*&quot;Beart de r√©ir √°r mbriathar&quot; (Action to match our speech)

===Notable &quot;f√©nnid&quot;===
*Fionn mac Cumhaill: last leader of the Fianna
*Cumhall: Fionn&#x27;s father, the former leader
*Goll mac Morna
*Ca√≠lte mac R√≥n√°in
*Con√°n mac Morna
*Diarmuid Ua Duibhne: a warrior of the Fianna who ran off with Fionn&#x27;s intended bride Gr√°inne and was finally killed by a giant boar on the heath of Benn Gulbain. Foster son of Aengus.
*Lughaid L√°mhfhada: sorcerous warrior, nephew of Fionn, one of the four who could have untied the knots Diarmuid bound the sea-kings with, but refused to do so. Lover of A√≠fe, daughter of Manann√°n
*Ois√≠n, son of Fionn (Macpherson&#x27;s Ossian)
*Oscar, son of Ois√≠n
*Cael Ua Neamhnainn

==Modern use of the term==
In more recent history, the name &quot;Fianna √âireann&quot; has been used, as &quot;Fianna F√°il&quot; (&quot;the &quot;Fianna&quot; of Ireland&quot;, or Inis F√°il i.e. &quot;the isle of destiny&quot;, and hence sometimes rendered &quot;the soldiers of destiny&quot;) has been used: as a sobriquet for the Irish Volunteers, on the cap badge of the Irish Army, the name in Irish of the Army Ranger Wing (&quot;Sciath√°n Fiann√≥glaigh an Airm&quot;), in the opening line of the Irish-language version of the Irish national anthem, and as the name of the Fianna F√°il political party.

<text>Na Fianna √âireann (The Fianna of Ireland), known as the Fianna (&quot;Soldiers of Ireland&quot;), is an Irish nationalist youth organisation founded by Constance Markievicz in 1909, with later help from Bulmer Hobson. Fianna members were involved in setting up the Irish Volunteers, and had their own circle of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). They took part in the 1914 Howth gun-running and (as Volunteer members) in the 1916 Easter Rising. They were active in the War of Independence and many took the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War.

The Fianna were declared an illegal organisation by the government of the Irish Free State in 1931. This was reversed when Fianna F√°il came to power in 1932, but re-introduced in 1938. During the splits in the Republican movement of the later part of the 20th century, the Fianna and Cumann na mBan supported Provisional Sinn F√©in in 1969 and Republican Sinn F√©in in 1986. The Fianna have been a proscribed organisation in Northern Ireland since 1920.

==Origins==
An earlier &quot;Fianna&quot; was organised &quot;to serve as a Junior Hurling League to promote the study of the Irish Language&quot; on 26 June 1902 at the Catholic Boys&#x27; Hall, Falls Road, in West Belfast, the brainchild of Bulmer Hobson. Hobson, a Quaker influenced by suffragism and nationalism, joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1904 and was an early member of Sinn F√©in during its monarchist-nationalist period, alongside Arthur Griffith and Constance Markievicz. Hobson later relocated to Dublin and the Fianna organisation collapsed in Belfast.
Markievicz, inspired by the rapid growth of Baden-Powell&#x27;s Boy Scouts, formed sometime before July 1909 the &quot;Red Branch Knights&quot;, a Dublin branch of Irish National Boy Scouts. After discussions involving Hobson, Markievicz, suffragist and labour activist Helena Molony and Se√°n McGarry, the Irish National Boy Scouts changed their name to Na Fianna √âireann at a meeting in 34 Lower Camden Street, Dublin, on 16 August 1909 (the building today marked with a commemorative plaque), at which Hobson was elected as president (thus ensuring a strong IRB influence), Markievicz as vice-president and P√°draig √ì Riain as secretary. Se√°n Heuston was the leader of the Fianna on Dublin&#x27;s north side, while Cornelius &quot;Con&quot; Colbert was the leader on the south side. The Fianna formed as a Nationalist alternative to Powell&#x27;s Scouts with the aim to achieve the full independence of Ireland by training and teaching scouting and military exercises, Irish history, and the Irish language.

==Early years==
In 1913, a Fianna instructional handbook was published and produced by P√°draig √ì Riain with articles being contributed by Patrick Pearse and Roger Casement, as well as advertisements from suppliers of uniforms and equipment. The timing coincided with the Irish Volunteers being established and the book was widely used by them Countess Markievicz bought a large rambling house at Ranelagh, Surrey House. It became the unofficial headquarters of the Fianna for some time. The older boys would gather and train here, and a mini firing range was set up in the basement. The boys also had a radio set in operation, which led to a raid by the Dublin Metropolitan Police. A separate HQ was later set up in 12 D&#x27;Olier Street.

The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) focused on recruiting any members who had reached the age of seventeen, and in 1912, Hobson started an IRB circle within the Fianna named the John Mitchel Literary and Debating Society, whose members included Colbert, √ì Riain, Heuston, Garry Holohan, Desmond Ryan, Liam Mellows and Barney Mellows.

==Irish Volunteers==

The Fianna played an active part during the 1913 Dublin Lock-out. A Fianna member, Patsy O&#x27;Connor, died after being battened on the head by a Dublin Metropolitan Police man while giving first aid to an injured man.

As the Fianna was organised four years earlier than the Irish Volunteers, and as many of its members were now young adults, fully trained in many aspects of military discipline, many young members transferred to the Volunteers on the army&#x27;s foundation in November 1913. The committee which set up the Irish Volunteers had three Fianna members on it. Con Colbert, Michael Lonergan, √âamon Martin and Padraig √ì&#x27;Riain were prominent in training Irish Volunteers. Seamus Pounch was instrumental in the training of the Cumann na mBan women&#x27;s auxiliary in 1914.

===1914 gun running===

The Fianna played a part in gun-running in Kilcoole and Howth. Fianna members brought their treck-cart to Howth Pier to meet the Asgard. The treck-cart was full of home-made batons, and these were distributed to the Volunteers on the pier. The cart was then used to carry the surplus rifles back to the city. At Clontarf, the DMP and British military were awaiting the return of the volunteers and a confrontation ensued. Fianna officers detoured with their gun-laden cart up the Howth Road, arriving eventually at Kilmore Road, Artane, where the arms were stored for later recovery.

John Redmond forced his nominees to be added the Volunteers&#x27; central committee in 1914, leading to a split at the outbreak of World War I. Bulmer Hobson&#x27;s help to Redmond, and his subsequent opposition to the Easter Rising (he was kept under armed guard by Se√°n Mac Diarmada on Easter Monday 1916 as the Rising broke out, and held until the rising was under way, upon which he fled home to Belfast) led to Hobson&#x27;s being sidelined by the republican movement and removed from any leadership role for the rest of his life.

===Easter Rising (1916)===

Among the first shots fired during the Rising were by Fianna members who attacked and captured the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park. A son of the Magazine Fort&#x27;s commander was shot dead by an IRA volunteer, Garry Holohan, as he [the son] ran to raise the alarm at Islandbridge.

The Fianna fought in all the garrisons involved in the 1916 Easter Rising. Though they were by then members of the Irish Volunteers, Se√°n Heuston and Con Colbert were still regarded as Fianna members. Heuston was commander of the Mendicity Institution garrison, while Colbert was under the command of √âamonn Ceannt at Watkins Brewery. Heuston and Colbert were executed for their part in the Rising.

Markievicz and Molony fought as members of the Irish Citizen Army (the Irish Volunteers were an exclusively male force); Markievicz, operating under Michael Mallin at the College of Surgeons, was sentenced to death but eventually reprieved, but kept in prison longer than any other person involve in the Rising, often in solitary confinement.

In Galway, Liam Mellows was in command of activities, but escaped capture and got to the United States, where he raised help for the War of Independence. (Mellows later returned to Ireland and was executed by order of the Irish Free State Government while imprisoned during the Irish Civil War.)

After the garrison abandoned the GPO and retreated to Moore Street, James Connolly gave command of the GPO to Se√°n McLoughlin, a Fianna officer. His orders were to oversee the safe retreat of the rest of the occupants.

Several of the Fianna were killed during the Rising. Se√°n Healy was shot dead at Phibsboro while delivering dispatches. Se√°n Howard and Se√°n Ryan died in similar fashion. Volunteers under the command of Fianna officer Paddy Holahan captured and burned down the Linenhall Barracks. Eamon Martin, a future Chief of Staff, was seriously wounded at the Broadstone Railway Station. At least fifteen Fianna officers from the Dublin Brigade were later interned at Frongoch internment camp, North Wales after the Rising was put down. Se√°n Heuston and Con Colbert were executed for their role in the Rising.

==Post 1916 reorganisation==

The Fianna was first to reorganise after the Easter Rising of 1916. A provisional governing committee was set up in Dublin in May 1916, whose members included Eamon Martin, Seamus Pounch, Theo Fitzgerald, Liam Staines, and Joe Reynolds. All had evaded the round-up after the Rising. This committee functioned until January 1917, when it handed over command to the newly released senior officers. In February 1917, a section of the Fianna marched in full uniform to mass at Blanchardstown, County Dublin for Michael Mallin, who had been executed following the Easter Rising. Garry Holohan reported that &quot;As the police did not interfere, we got courage and got bolder and bolder. On one route march, the police at James Street stopped us and an Inspector of the DMP grabbed me. However, as the Fianna Scouts became so threatening, I was released.&quot;

A year after the Rising, a large demonstration was held outside the burnt-out shell of Liberty Hall. A large contingent of Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP), including one ranked inspector, John Mills, arrived and the Riot Act was read to the crowd. The police waded into the crowd with batons to arrest those addressing the crowd, including Cathal Brugha and George Noble (Count) Plunkett. While escorting the prisoners, Inspector Mills was struck a mortal blow to the head with a cam√°n. Later Fianna witness statements indicated that the blow was struck by Eamon Murray, a young Fianna officer, who was O/C of a Sluagh (branch) on Parnell Square. He made off along Abbey Street, pursued by a DMP man. He was cornered at Marlborough Street, but he or another Fianna member drew a pistol and the policeman backed off. He was sheltered by Constance Markievicz then smuggled to the United States, where he remained until the Truce of 1921, and later fought with the anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War.

An intensive recruiting campaign was set in motion throughout the city and county after the earlier reorganisation of January 1917, and it proved to be a tremendous success. Recruits came in large numbers and new companies were formed. In June, the Dublin Battalion had become so large and unwieldy, that it was decided to set up a Brigade structure of two battalions. The county was simply split in two, with the Liffey as the divide. South of the Liffey became the 1st Battalion and north of the Liffey became the 2nd Battalion. The Dublin Brigade Staff in June 1917 comprised Garry Holohan (Commandant), P.J. Stephenson (Adjutant) and Joe Reynolds (QM).

The Fianna continued to defy the British ban on marching and parading, and drilled openly with hurleys in open defiance. This led to clashes with the DMP and the Royal Irish Constabulary. In July 1917 the whole Dublin Battalion went on a route march through the south city and county. Efforts were made by the DMP to stop the march and break it up at Terenure and Rathmines DMP stations, but the marchers broke through the cordons at both points. The march continued to the GPO, where the parade was dismissed. Se√°n Saunders recalled being arrested at Milltown with Roddy Connolly (son of James Connolly), Hugo MacNeill, Theo Fitzgerald, Se√°n McLoughlin and Garry Holohan.

===Army Agreement===

It came to the attention of GHQ Staff c1918 that in many areas around the country the Fianna was controlled by the local units of the Irish Volunteers. A meeting of Fianna GHQ representatives and Volunteer representatives was held in Dublin to discuss the problem. What emerged from this meeting was the Army Agreement. From that point on, the Volunteers would not seek to control Fianna in their areas. Those who reached the age of seventeen had transferred to the Volunteers; this would now cease and any transfer would be voluntary. The volunteer O/C was to liaise with the Fianna O/C on all local matters, and due consideration was to be extended to Fianna.

==War of Independence==

During the &quot;Tan War&quot;, Fianna members featured prominently in every brigade area. Some lost their lives or were imprisoned. In a picture taken of the West Mayo Brigade Active Service Unit in 1921, ten of the thirty in the photograph had been members of the Westport Fianna Sluagh, as had Tom Derrig, who rose to the rank of Adjutant General during the Civil War.

During the Truce of July to September 1921, the Fianna devoted a great amount of time to training. At least three full-time training camps were set up to train potential officers. One of these camps was held at Kilmore Road, Artane, Dublin and another at Kilmashogue Mountain. At the 1921 Ard Fheis held in Dublin Munster was described as having 84 Fianna sluaithe (branches); Ulster 20; Connacht 10, and Leinster 41. Kerry had 37 Sluaithe, Cork 24, and Dublin 16. The Fianna held discussions all over the country where they debated the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Fianna rejected the Treaty and called for all members to continue work for a Republic. In support of this, the Dublin Brigade&#x27;s Fianna marched to Smithfield where they were reviewed by senior Republican leaders.

==Civil War==

Fianna √âireann played a major part in the Civil War fighting, especially in Dublin. When the Four Courts garrison was attacked in July 1922, a second front was created to relieve the Four Courts. The Dublin Brigade of the Fianna provided many leaders in this period. All along the eastern side of O&#x27;Connell Street buildings were taken over and barricaded. Parnell Square and Parnell Street were similarly barricaded. Fianna, under their new Brigadier, Se√°n Harling, took over 35 North Great Georges Street as a barracks.

In August 1922 (the same month in which Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith) died, the Fianna sustained a heavy blow when two of their senior officers in Dublin, Se√°n Cole and Alf Colley, were shot dead by Free State Army Intelligence members at The Thatch, Whitehall.

Four hundred officers and boys of the Fianna had taken part in the Dublin fighting of 1922. By October of that year, the only active members were in an eight-member active service unit led by Frank Sherwin.

The bullet-riddled corpses of three teenaged Fianna Scouts, Edwin Hughes (17), Joseph Rogers (16) and Brendan Holohan (16), were found at The Quarries, Naas Road, Clondalkin on 28 November 1922. They were all from the Drumcondra area and had been putting up republican posters in the Clonliffe Road district. They were arrested by a high-ranking Free State officer, Charlie Dalton (younger brother of Emmet Dalton). The Scouts were brought for interrogation to Wellington Barracks, where Free State Army Intelligence had their HQ. That was the last time that they were seen alive.

When the Free State started to execute Republican prisoners, the first to be shot were four young men who had left the Fianna to join the Irish Republican Army. The executions of Rory O&#x27;Connor, Joe McKelvey, Liam Mellows and Dick Barrett became a symbol for the Fianna. They became known as &quot;The Four Martyrs&quot;. A prominent ex-Fianna officer, Hugo MacNeill (nephew of Eoin MacNeill), commanded the firing squad. Eamon Martin related that he was a cellmate of Mellows in Mountjoy Prison. Until 1964, an annual concert was held by the Fianna to commemorate their executions. These executions were followed by another group of three, who had similarly graduated from the ranks of the Dublin Brigade of the Fianna.

The Fianna ceased to function as an open organisation by Christmas 1922. All senior Fianna members were being rounded up by the Free State military and CID, and at the brutal internment camp Tintown 3 in The Curragh there was one hut dedicated to Fianna members, some as young as fourteen.

==1925 Ard Fh√©is==
*Fianna Chief: Constance Markievicz
*Adjutant General: Barney Mellows
*A/Adjutant General: Alfie White
*Director of Organisation: Liam Langley
*A/Director of Organisation: Frank Sherwin
*QMG: Joe Reynolds
*A/QMG: Sean Harling

After internment Sean Harling, former leader of the Fianna, married and eventually fell on hard times. In his own words, he was compromised by the Free State Special Branch and agreed to become an agent for them within the republican movement. He was eventually exposed by Fianna Intelligence Officer Frank Sherwin in 1926. Two former Fianna members made an attempt on his life in 1928, but Harling escaped and shot dead one of his attackers, Tim Coghlan of Inchicore. Harling was secreted out of the country by the Special Branch and lived in the US until his return in 1933 to Ireland.

==Fianna proscribed==

Fianna √âireann was decimated after the Civil War, and further disintegration occurred in 1926 when Fianna F√°il was founded. Constance Markievicz was a founding member of that party but, her health broken by years of imprisonment, she died in 1927 after two appendix operations. In 1930 the Fianna got the use of the Hardwicke Hall in Dublin (owned by the family of Joseph Plunkett and site of Thomas MacDonagh&#x27;s Theatre of Ireland from 1914 to 1916) as a headquarters as George Plunkett was nominated by the IRA as Chief Scout. This was a nominal position; the organisation was run by the HQ staff. At this time, the Fianna expanded in proportion to the rest of the Republican Movement. In 1933 Frank Ryan became Adjutant General for eight months. The 1934 HQ report said that there were 104 &quot;sluaithe&quot; in operation. Eight hundred people paraded under the Fianna flag at Bodenstown that year, and Diarmuid MacGiolla Phadraig became Adjutant General.

The Free State government brought in new legislation in 1931 to counter the popularity of resurgent republicanism. Now the Fianna, the IRA and Cumann na mBan were all classified as illegal organisations. Many arrests followed, and these organisations had to go underground. When the Fianna F√°il government was elected to power in March 1932, this legislation was revoked, most of the prisoners were freed and many young republicans switched allegiance to Fianna F√°il. In 1934, the Fianna F√°il government expanded the Free State CID, the new ranks were filled largely by enticing members of the IRA&#x27;s Dublin Brigade to join the Special Branch of An Garda S√≠och√°na. Former volunteers were sworn in as Garda√≠ detective officers and issued handguns, ammunition, badges and whistles. They were under the control of Ned Broy of the CID in a group known as the &quot;Broy Harriers&quot;, a term first used in the Seanad by Senator Brian O&#x27;Rourke during the discussion on the Garda S√≠och√°na estimates on 16 August 1933.

The 1936 Fianna Convention reported that there were 18 &quot;sluaithe&quot; in the organisation. The IRA, Cumann na mBan and the Fianna were once again outlawed that June. In 1938 an advisory body of prominent republicans was set up to help reorganise the Fianna; included were George Plunkett, Brian O&#x27;Higgins, Mary MacSwiney and Madge Daly. The following year, Joe Atkinson of Belfast was appointed as a national organiser and cycled through the country contacting failed Fianna &quot;sluaithe&quot; and creating new ones. Later that year he was appointed Adjutant General and Liam Nolan of Kerry became National Organiser. George Plunkett resigned as Chief Scout for health reasons. In 1940, 150 Fianna marched in Dublin on the eve of the executions of two republicans responsible for a fatal bombing in Coventry, Barnes and McCormack in Britain. Fianna in Dublin were under the control of Jack Rowan, Kevin Hudson and Mattie O&#x27;Neill. Four &quot;sluaithe&quot; were reported active in Dublin and although the use of Hardwicke Hall was lost, newly released internees helped in the re-organization, including Wattie Bell, Noel and Des Goulding, Paddy Dillon and Mattie Carey.

By 1943, owing to arrests, internment and emigration, the Fianna in Dublin was reduced to one &quot;sluagh&quot;, run by Peadar Timmins. Dick Bell was released from internment in 1945 and led the Fianna in Dublin, with Con Dillon as his adjutant and Mattie O&#x27;Neill as quartermaster. They set up a Fianna GHQ. By 1947 Dublin had a new O/C, Des Carron, with Wattie Bell as his adjutant. The first annual camp of the new group was held in 1947 and later that year Carron and Bell cycled to Munster, organising Fianna &quot;sluaithe&quot; at Clonmel and Tralee. The following year the first Ard Fheis since 1940 was held in Dublin. Dublin reported having one &quot;sluagh&quot;, which met at 9 Parnell Square.

==Fianna organisation after 1950==

When World War II broke out, the old IRA and old Fianna organisations marched as a body to Griffith Barracks in Dublin and joined the Irish Army as a battalion (the 26th Battalion). When on parade, this battalion flew the Fianna and √ìglaigh na h-√âireann flags. When the war was over these bodies stayed intact and had premises at Parnell Square. They marched in Bodenstown with Fianna F√°il and attended all the usual commemorations organised by the government. In 1953, the Old Fianna organisation issued an invitation to Ned Kelly (Chief Scout) to meet with them. The Old Fianna reportedly offered their Fianna flag to the then-current Fianna. However, when Kelly heard that the flag would be handed over in a military barracks in an official ceremony, that was unacceptable, and the parley proved fruitless. The old Fianna petered out in the late 1950s.

In 1951 the Ard Fheis in Dublin reported that 9 &quot;sluaithe&quot; were in existence. 500 Fianna were present at the Bodenstown commemoration and Dick Bell was re-elected as Chief Scout. He did not seek re-election at the 1952 Ard Fheis and Tomas MacCurtain was nominated as a nominal Chief Scout, succeeded by Ned Kelly of Long Lane, Dorset Street, Dublin in 1953. Ned Kelly soon he gathered around him a cadre of young leaders and had four &quot;sluaithe&quot; running in the Dublin area. These were at North City, Drimnagh/Crumlin, Dundrum and Finglas. He had as his adjutant Brian McConnell from Swilly Road in Cabra. His QM was Annrai MacGloin from Bohernabreena.

In 1954/55 a split occurred in the republican movement. Activists led by Joe Christle became disenchanted with the leadership. They were looking for armed action in Northern Ireland, but were restrained by the Army Council. This breakaway group aligned with Saor Uladh. They set up a youth group who also called themselves Fianna √âireann with Gearoid O&#x27;Kelly as Chief Scout; he previously had a Fianna &quot;sluagh&quot; in Newbridge, but was now living in Ballyboden. This Fianna had one &quot;sluagh&quot;, at Inchicore, with members mainly from the Drimnagh and Crumlin area. A serious clash occurred between the two groups later in 1959 over the sale of the Easter Lily, commemorating the republican dead.

Ned Kelly was dismissed from the republican movement in 1955 and replaced as Chief Scout by George Darle from Drumcondra, a nominee of the IRA who had some Catholic Boy Scouts experience. He brought new blood into the organisation, including Frank Lee and Terry Kiely. They set about reorganising the Fianna and soon new &quot;sluaithe&quot; were being formed in Navan, Dundalk, Drogheda and Sligo.

The Border Campaign by the IRA, which began in December 1956, led to the Fianna losing many of its members, especially in Dublin. In January 1957, 38 IRA recruits were surrounded and arrested in a house used for training in Glencree, Co Wicklow. At least 12 of these had been members of the Dublin Battalion of the Fianna.

===Uniform changes ca. 1958===

The uniform in 1958 was basically the same as when Fianna was founded in 1909: a green blouse with two rows of brass buttons, an orange neckerchief, slouch hat, black shorts and a white lanyard with a whistle. Officers wore riding breeches and a military jacket, slouch hat and a Sam Browne belt. The uniform was now changed to resemble an American Boy Scout uniform: a green shirt with two pockets and a military-style side hat. Eventually, the side hats were replaced by a green beret, and the long trousers for officers were replaced by black shorts or breeches.

===Jubilee Camp 1959===

A committee was sent up by GHQ in 1958 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fianna&#x27;s founding. Chief Scout Jimmy Cruise headed this body and it was decided to hold a camp in central Ireland for all Fianna &quot;sluaithe&quot;. Permission was given by the Patrician Brothers, Ballyfin, County Laois, to use their grounds for this purpose in August 1959. These were years when money was scarce and travelling made difficult. Consequently, only about 100 Fianna members attended the camp. Each &quot;sluagh&quot; catered for itself and there were joint activities organised. The Special Branch of the Garda S√≠och√°na was busy while the camp was in progress, visiting the homes of Fianna members, especially the young Scouts, telling the parents that the boys were on an IRA training camp. Quite a few members were lost this way. In 1959, Fianna was given the privilege of having its colour party lead the annual pilgrimage to the grave of Wolfe Tone at Bodenstown. A report to the Ard Fheis in 1963 showed that, as well as the sluaithe mentioned above, there were now new units in Roscrea, Nenagh, and Ballyfermot/Chapelizod. A new department had been set up which catered for friends of the Fianna who were either too old to join, or were not in a position to do so. This was known as the dept. of Associated Members. This new section was run by the Adjutant General.
===Junior members===

Fianna had always catered for boys between the ages of eleven years and sixteen years. About 1959, a new idea was put in place to cater to younger boys. With the assistance of some Cumann na mBan members, boys as young as eight years were allowed into the ranks of the Fianna. They wore a plain green sweater and yellow neckerchief. This venture was a success and most sluaithe (branches) followed suit.

===New Fianna handbook===
A committee was set up circa 1963 to gather funds to produce a new Fianna handbook. All of the committee were members of the GHQ, and included Liam MacAnUltaigh, Deas√∫n √ì Briain, Brian Mulvanney, Uinsionn O&#x27;Cathain and Tony Shannon. Funds and advertisers were procured and a new handbook appeared ca. 1965. This was the third edition of the handbook, the others having been printed in 1913 and 1924.

===Arrest of Fianna officers===

Around November 1963 action was taken against Gear√≥id O&#x27;Kelly who was allegedly collecting money in pubs for &quot;Republican Prisoners&#x27; Dependents&quot;. On a Saturday night in November 1963 he was stopped near his home at Ballyboden Road, Rathfarnham by a party of armed men. They bundled him into a field and &quot;tarred and feathered&quot; him. About eleven senior officers were arrested by the Special Branch the following Monday morning and brought to the Bridewell.

After a few hours, O&#x27;Kelly was brought in to try to identify those who may have assaulted him. The officers were all brought into one room and O&#x27;Kelly viewed them through a glass panel from an adjoining room. No one was detained, and most had alibis, as they were at an Ard Coiste meeting at Gardiner Place at the time of the assault and had been seen entering and leaving the building by the Special Branch men who constantly watched that premises. O&#x27;Kelly had also fallen out with his &#x27;Fianna&#x27; and two of his associates (Weldon and Phelan), spent six months in prison for assaulting him. He gave up his activities at this stage.

===Activities===

The 1950s and 1960s were very active years for Fianna members. A Sluagh usually held one meeting per week, where all met on parade in full uniform. All the usual Scouting test work was undertaken, games played and instructions given regarding hikes or camps on the following weekend. Weather never held the Scouts back from the &#x27;great outdoors&#x27;, and Fianna members could be encountered in all weathers, especially in the Dublin/Wicklow mountains. This was a time when much military surplus clothing and camping equipment was coming onto the market following the end of the Korean War. One Sluagh, Finglas, had snow tents previously used by the British Army, suitable for camping out in all types of weather.

Another favourite weekend pastime was &#x27;shacking&#x27;. Throughout the mountains were numerous old deserted houses (shacks), and at weekends the Fianna would use them for shelter. One favourite one was called &#x27;Thunders&#x27; in Glencree. Another was in the Glen of the Downs, near the village of Delgany, where there was a Fianna Sluagh. All-night hikes were a favourite with the officers. The last bus out of town to Rathfarnham, Enniskerry or Bohernabreena would be taken, and then the group would march all night across the hills, to where they would pick up the first bus back to the city again. Youth-hosteling was also undertaken, popular with the younger Scouts. Hostels such as Glencree, Baltyboys and Knockree were all within striking distance of the buses from Dublin. Many Dublin Sluagh organised Whit weekend camps and annual week long camps. During the early 1960s national camps were held at Castledermot (County Carlow) and another at Glencolumbkille (County Donegal).
Republican commemorations were constantly being held and the Fianna was obliged to turn out in full to them. And during this time high ranking Inchicore republican John McGrath brought in several new members to the Fianna. The annual Easter Commemoration was usually the first on the calendar. The parade would line up at St. Stephens Green and march all the way to Glasnevin Cemetery. On the same day, a parade was usually held in Blackrock or Deans Grange Cemetery as well. The Wolf Tone Commemoration was next in line, usually on the last Sunday in June. This was usually a great day out. Trains would come from Dublin, Cork and Kerry for the occasion, and buses from all parts of the country: it was a festive occasion. In November there was held the Manchester Martyrs parade and concert, and in December the Fianna always hosted the Four Martyrs Concert in Dublin. In between all of these occasions, there were many times when the Fianna was invited to provide colour-parties and contingents in various parts of the country to commemorate fallen republican soldiers.

Many republican demonstrations were held in these years to protest against internment and coercion. The Fianna always played its part on these occasions and was highly visible on the streets when needed. A major source of income always came from the sale of the Easter Lily at Eastertime. Many times the boxes and contents were confiscated by the Garda, as the Fianna never applied for permits.
===After 1969===
Similarly to the wider republican movement, the Fianna experienced a number of splits after the outbreak of the Troubles. In 1969 two rival groups claimed the title of the Fianna √âireann; one composed of members under the control and influence of the Official movement who wanted to end the Sinn F√©in abstentionist policy, and the other aligned to the re-organized Provisional Sinn F√©in and IRA movement who supported a continuation of the traditional policy.

The Fianna group aligned with the Officials was dissolved in 1976 by the Official Army Council and replaced by the Irish Democratic Youth Movement after a significant number of Fianna volunteers left, taking with them a significant quantity of arms, in the 1974 OIRA-INLA split.

In 1986 there was a further split within (Provisional) Sinn F√©in and the IRA due to the dropping of Sinn F√©in&#x27;s abstentionist policy. After this split the Fianna withdrew its support from the Provisional movement, citing republican principles. It now supports Republican Sinn F√©in and the Continuity IRA. Vice News reported that in early 2015 the group had about 30 members.

According to a 2020 study, four factors are associated with Fianna membership: &quot;First, working-class background, with its related deprivation and social problems (such as criminality and drug addiction); second, the importance of family links and social networks; third, social media as an introduction to republicanism; and, fourth, fascination with Irish history.&quot;

<text>Goll mac Morna (or Goal mac Morn) was a member of the fianna and an uneasy ally of Fionn mac Cumhail in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. He had killed Fionn&#x27;s father, Cumhal, and taken over the leadership of the fianna, but when Fionn grew up and proved his worth Goll willingly stepped aside in his favour.

His given name was √Åed or Aedh mac Morna. He is also known as √Åed mac Fidga. He gained the name Goll (&quot;one-eyed&quot;) when he lost an eye in his battle with Cumhal or, in other versions, Luchet, as described below:

&quot;Aed was the name of D√°ire&#x27;s son,

Until Luchet of fame wounded him;

Since the heavy lance wounded him,

Therefore, he has been called Goll.&quot;

A different Goll, a Fomorian, was an opponent of Lugaidh Lamhfhada, who knocked out his eye and slayed him at Moytura.

As well as that, another variant of the story tells how Goll was chased by Fionn MacCumhaill, leader of the Fianna, to the north coast of Donegal where he was slain on a rock off the coast which known as &#x27;carraig ghoill&#x27; (Goll&#x27;s Rock). This event gave the surrounding Rosguill peninsula its name - Ros Goill refers to &#x27;Goll&#x27;s peninsula&#x27;.

When the witch Irnan failed to capture members of the fianna in a magical web, she turned herself into a monster and challenged any one of the finians to single combat. Initially Fionn mac Cumhaill stepped forward but was persuaded by his warband that it would not be heroic for a warrior of his stature to face a hag in combat. Goll took his place and slew Irnan, and was allowed to marry Fionn&#x27;s daughter as a reward.

In the tale &quot;Cath Gabhra&quot;, which describes the battle in which the Fianna fight and are destroyed by the forces of the High King Cairbre Lifechair, Goll and those loyal to him defect to Cairbre&#x27;s side and fight against Fionn.

&quot;Tapadh le Goll, mharbh e mh√†thair&quot; (&quot;Thanks to Goll, he has killed his mother&quot;) is a Scottish Gaelic proverb used whenever a nuisance is gotten rid of by the individual responsible for it. For example, Goll killed his mother by mistake with a bone.

<text>Cumhall (; ) or Cumhall mac Tr√©nmhoir (&quot;son of Tr√©nm√≥r/Tr√©anm√≥r&quot; meaning &quot;strong-great&quot;) is a figure in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology, a leader of the fianna and the father of Fionn mac Cumhaill.

== Genealogy ==

The most important text regarding the family of Finn (son of Cumaill) is &quot;Fotha Catha Chnucha&quot; (&quot;The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha&quot;), as it is contained in the ancient parchment &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; (LU), dated to the 12th century. Otherwise, the next most important tract is the &quot;Macgn√≠martha Finn&quot; (&quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;) copied in a 15th-century manuscript.

According to the &quot;Fotha Catha Chnucha&quot;, Cumhall mac Tr√©nmhoir was son of a petty king, and served the High King Conn Cet-Chathach &quot;of the Hundred Battles&quot;. Cumhall was also Conn&#x27;s half-uncle, his mother being the mother of Conn&#x27;s father.

Cumhall became suitor for the hand of Muirne Muncaim &quot;of the fair neck&quot;, daughter of the druid Tadg mac Nuadat, but Tadg refused him, so Cumhall forcibly carried away Muirne in elopement.

;In-laws
In &quot;Fotha Catha Chnucha&quot; Cumhall&#x27;s wife was the granddaughter to Nuadat who was a druid to king Cathair M√≥r, but she was granddaughter to N√∫adu of the Tuatha D√© Danann according to a passage in the &quot;Acallamh na Senorach&quot;. Also where the former work gives Almu daughter of Becan as Nuadat&#x27;s wife, the latter treats Almha the daughter of Brecan as a virgin daughter who bore Cumall a son then died in childbirth.

;Siblings
Cumhall had a brother, Crimmal mac Tr√©nmhoir, who was an ally of Fionn.

== Battle and death ==

Tadg, slighted by Cumall&#x27;s sweeping away his daughter, appealed to Cumall&#x27;s lord, Conn of the Hundred Battles, and Conn gave choice of either relinquishing the daughter or suffer banishment. Cumall refused to give up his wife, and Conn made war against Cumhall, and Cumhall was killed by Goll mac Morna in this Battle of Cnucha, located at what is today Castleknock. Goll then took over leadership of the Fianna, as explained in the &quot;Magn√≠martha Finn&quot;.

Cumhall&#x27;s wife Muirne was already pregnant with his son, Fionn, and Muirne&#x27;s furious father Tadg not only refused to accept her back, but ordered her burnt to death. Cumhall&#x27;s wife however seeks Conn&#x27;s protection, and in exile she delivers a child which she names Demni. Demni (Demne) later became Finn.

Cumhall is reputed to be buried within the grounds of Castleknock College, supposedly under a hill upon which an old water tower now stands.

== Parallels ==
Attempts to connect Cumhall with Camulus, a Celtic god of war known from Roman-era inscriptions, are now largely rejected. Old Irish &quot;cumal&quot; means &quot;female slave&quot;, and it is possible that a noble father was invented for Fionn to obscure an ignoble origin. Alternatively, some early texts call the hero &quot;Fionn mac Umaill&quot;, which may indicate his father&#x27;s name was originally Umall.

<text>Muirne or Muireann Munch√°em (&quot;beautiful neck&quot;) was the sister of Uirne and the mother of Fionn mac Cumhail in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.

She had many suitors, but her father, the druid Tadg mac Nuadat, had foreseen that her marriage would lead to the loss of his home on the hill of Almu, so he refused them all. But one of them, Cumhal, leader of the fianna, abducted her. Tadg appealed to the High King, Conn of the Hundred Battles, who outlawed and pursued Cumhal.

Cumhal was killed in the Battle of Cnucha, but Muirne was already pregnant, so her father rejected her and told his followers to burn her. Conn prevented this, and sent Muirne into the protection of Fiacal mac Conchinn and his wife, the druidess Bodhmall, who was Cumhal&#x27;s sister. She gave birth to a son, whom she called Deimne, but who later became known as Fionn.

Muirne left the boy in the care of Bodhmall and a warrior woman called Liath Luachra, who brought him up in secret in the forest. She went on to marry a local king, Gleor L√°mderg, and saw her son again only once, six years later, when she came to visit him in the forest.

<text>Bodhmall (or bodhmann, B√≥mall, Bodmall, or Bodbmall) is one of Fionn mac Cumhaill&#x27;s childhood foster mothers in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology and the daughter of Tr√©anm√≥r mac Suailt. She is a druid and the sister of Fionn&#x27;s father Cumhall, and both she and her female partner Liath Luachra are known as great warriors.

Bodhmall&#x27;s story appears in &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;. When Cumhall is slain by Goll mac Morna, his wife Muirne fears for their son&#x27;s safety. Bodhmall and Liath Luachra come to her, and take the boy to be raised in the forest of Sliabh Bladhma. There they teach him to hunt, and accompany him on some of his early adventures. When he grows up and news of his exploits spreads, the warrior women fear he will attract the attention of Goll&#x27;s men. They send him out to find his own way, having taught him all they know.

<text>Liath Luachra or the &quot;Grey one of Luachair&quot;, is the name of two characters in the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. Both appear in &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot;, which details the young life and adventures of the hero Fionn mac Cumhaill. Alfred Nutt for example distinguished the two as figures of different gender.

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn&#x27;s foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father Cumhal at the hands of Goll mac Morna. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn&#x27;s aunt, the druidess Bodhmall; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of Sliabh Bladhma. Eventually Fionn&#x27;s ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father&#x27;s killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of Bantry&#x27;s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the Fianna. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal&#x27;s treasures, and made him the Fianna&#x27;s official treasurer. His &quot;corrbolg&quot; or &quot;crane bag&quot; is one of the warrior band&#x27;s great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man&#x27;s mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, Con√°n mac Lia, who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

<text>In Irish mythology, Finnguala (modern spellings: [[Fionnghuala]], Fionnuala , or Finola; literally meaning &quot;white shoulder&quot;) was the daughter of Lir of the Tuatha D√© Danann. In the legend of the &quot;Children of Lir&quot;, she was changed into a swan and cursed by her stepmother, Aoife, to wander the lakes and rivers of Ireland, with her brothers Fiachra, Conn and Aodh, for 900 years until saved by the marriage of Lairgren, son of Colman, son of Cobthach, and Deoch, daughter of Finghin, whose union broke the curse. &#x27;The Song of Fionnuala&#x27;, with lyrics by Thomas Moore speaks of her wanderings.

The name is anglicized as Fenella. The shortened version [[Nuala]] is commonly used as a first name in contemporary Ireland.

<doc id="86527" wikidata="Q615686" url="?curid=86527" title="A√≠fe">
<text>&#x27; (Old Irish), spelled &#x27; () in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic, is a character from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. She appears in the sagas &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; (&quot;the wooing of Emer&quot;) and &quot;Aided √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot; (&quot;the death of A√≠fe&#x27;s only son&quot;). In &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; she lives east of a land called &quot;Alpi&quot;, usually understood to mean Alba (Scotland), where she is at war with a rival woman warrior, Sc√°thach. In &quot;Aided √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot; she lives in Letha (the Armorican peninsula), and is Sc√°thach&#x27;s sister as well as rival ‚Äì they are both daughters of √Ård-Greimne of Lethra.

==Appearances==
In &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; the Ulaid hero C√∫ Chulainn has come to train in arms under Sc√°thach on the Isle of Skye, when a battle breaks against A√≠fe. Sc√°thach, fearful of C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s safety, gives him a sleeping potion to keep him from the battle, but a potion that would put most people to sleep for twenty-four hours only knocks him out for an hour, and he joins the fray. A√≠fe challenges Sc√°thach to single combat, and C√∫ Chulainn fights as Sc√°thach&#x27;s champion, but before the fight he asks Sc√°thach what it is that A√≠fe loves most, which Sc√°thach reveals is her chariot and horses. They begin to fight, and A√≠fe shatters C√∫ Chulainn&#x27;s sword, at which he cries out that A√≠fe&#x27;s chariot and horses have fallen over a cliff. When A√≠fe turns to look, he overpowers her, throws her over his shoulder, and carries her back to his side. He held his sword at her throat as she begged for her life. He chooses not to kill her, on two conditions: that she cease hostilities with Sc√°thach and she bear him a son.

When C√∫ Chulainn returns to Ireland he leaves A√≠fe pregnant. He gives her a gold ring to give to the child, and instructs her that when he is seven he is to come to Ireland in search of him, but he must not identify himself to anyone. The story is taken up again in &quot;Aided √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot;, when the boy, Connla by name, comes to Ireland as C√∫ Chulainn had instructed, and his precocious prowess alarms the Ulaid. Because he will not identify himself, C√∫ Chulainn fights and kills him. When it was too late C√∫ Chulainn recognised the ring; he had killed his only son.

== Biblical rendering ==
The name is unrelated to the Biblical name &quot;Eva&quot;, which was rendered as &quot;√âabha&quot; in Irish, but due to the similarity in sound, &quot;Aife&quot; has often been incorrectly anglicised as &quot;Eva&quot; or &quot;Eve&quot;. Aoife MacMurrough (also known as Eva of Leinster) was a 12th-century Irish noblewoman.

<text>Connla or Conlaoch is a character in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, the son of the Ulster champion C√∫ Chulainn and the Scottish warrior woman A√≠fe. He was raised alone by his mother in Scotland. He appears in the story &quot;Aided √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot; (&quot;The Tragic Death of A√≠fe&#x27;s Only Son&quot;), a pre-tale to the great epic &quot;T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge&quot;.

==Story==

Connla was the son of C√∫ Chulainn and A√≠fe Ardgeimm, identified in this text as the sister of his teacher Sc√°thach. Leaving to return to Ireland, C√∫ Chulainn gives A√≠fe a token, a gold thumb-ring, telling her that when his son is old enough to wear it, he should be sent to Ireland. However, he imposes three &quot;geasa&quot; or prohibitions on him. Connla cannot turn back once he starts his journey, he must not refuse a challenge, and must never tell anyone his name.

Connla comes ashore at Tracht Eisi, where he practises his martial feats. The Ulaid, observing these, recognise his skill as a warrior, and Conchobar observes that any land which produces young boys of such skill must be home to warriors who would &#x27;pound [the Ulaid] to dust&#x27;. They send Condere son of Echu to encounter him, and Condere asks Connla for his name and lineage, which he refuses to give. Condere then welcomes Connla, complimenting his skill as a warrior and inviting him to meet the Ulaid. But Connla only asks whether the Ulaid would like to fight him in single combat, or as a group, telling Condere that he is not worth fighting.

Condere returns to the Ulaid, and Conall Cernach goes out to meet Connla, saying, &quot;The Ulaid will not be shamed while I am alive.&quot; Connla strikes Conall with a stone from his slingshot that knocks him off his feet, and then disarms him. Conall returns shamed to the rest of the Ulaid.

C√∫ Chulainn then approaches Connla, but Emer, his wife, warns him not to fight him, identifying the boy as &quot;Conla, the only son of A√≠fe&quot;. C√∫ Chulainn rebukes her, saying that heroic deeds &quot;are not performed with a woman&#x27;s assistance&quot;, and that for the sake of the Ulaid, he would fight any intruder no matter who they were. He asks Connla to identify himself, warning him that he will die if he does not, but Connla refuses. They wrestle in the water, with Connla gaining the upper hand, until C√∫ Chulainn resorts to the gae bolga, a weapon whose use Sc√°thach taught only to him, and Connla is fatally wounded.

C√∫ Chulainn carries Connla to the shore and identifies him to the Ulaid as his son. Connla greets each of the heroes of the Ulaid in turn before bidding his father farewell and dying. He is grieved, and a marker is raised for his grave, &quot;and for three days not a calf of the cattle of the Ulaid was left alive after him&quot;.

== Versions and date ==
There are two versions of &quot;Aided √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot;. The earliest is a late Old Irish text, found in the Yellow Book of Lecan, which is the most well-known version and the source of the narrative above. It has been dated to the 9th or 10th century. There is also a later version in TCD 1336, appended with legal commentary about accountability and compensation.

Versions of the story also appear in the &quot;dinnsenchas of Lecht√°n √ìenfhir A√≠fe&quot;, Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;History of Ireland&quot;, and in an Early Modern Irish version, entitled &quot;Oidheadh Chonlaoich&quot;.

The tale of Connla shares many key aspects with stories from other traditions. In the Greek story of Theseus the hero is also born of an irregular union and raised by his mother in a far-off place. When of a similar stature to his unknown father he must take certain tokens left and set out to claim his birthright. He then combats with a series of opponents before meeting his father, Aegeus, and being recognised. A later unknowing father-son element in the story occurs when he returns from Crete, having killed the Minotaur, and the failure to reveal himself leads to the father&#x27;s death. There are also strong similarities with the lost Greek epic poem the Telegony were father and son fight. In its surviving summary, found in the &quot;Chrestomathy of Proclus&quot;, it is the unrecognised father rather than the son that is killed in combat. Telegonus, the son seeking his father, born of a woman in foreign lands (to the enchantress Circe), after travelling as a stranger to his paternal land, inadvertently fights and kills his father Odysseus. This he does with a lance tipped with the venomous spine of a stingray which could stand, as argued by Edward Petit, as the inspiration for the deadly G√°e Bulg of C√∫ Chulainn made from the bone of a sea monster, the Curruid. Again there is a scene as Odysseus lies dying, when he and Telegonus recognize one another, and in this case the son Telegonus laments his mistake.

The story also closely resembles the tenth-century tale of Rostam and Sohrab from the Iranian epic the Shahnameh; with an unknowing father-son in a closely matched wrestling duel in which the son is killed, a jewel token-memento and in some versions the use of a poisoned weapon as option of last resort. This in turn probably derives from the story of Babruvahana, son of Arjuna, in the Mahabharata part of the Indic epic tradition, with an unknowing father-son duel, a jewel-memento, the use of a divine weapon, the Pashupatastra, which cannot be resisted and is not to be used against lesser enemies, and particular to these two stories a following-a-horse element.

==In literature==

The story of Connla&#x27;s death by his father&#x27;s hand is related in the W. B. Yeats poem &quot;Cuchulain&#x27;s Fight with the Sea,&quot; first published in 1892. The poetic retelling differs in several respects from the original myth, including portraying Connla as the son of Emer and not A√≠fe.

<text>The G√°e Bulg () (also G√°e Bulga, G√°e Bolg, G√°e Bolga), meaning &quot;belly spear&quot;, &quot;gapped/notched spear&quot;, or &quot;spear of mortal pain/death&quot;, was the name of the spear of C√∫ Chulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. It was given to him by his martial arts teacher, the warrior woman Sc√°thach, and its technique was taught only to him.

It was made from the bone of a sea monster, the Curruid, that had died while fighting another sea monster, the Coinchenn. Although some sources make it out to be simply a particularly deadly spear, others‚Äînotably the Book of Leinster‚Äîstate that it could only be used under very specialized, ritual conditions:

In other versions of the legend, the spear had seven heads, each with seven barbs. In the &quot;T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge&quot;, C√∫chulainn received the spear after training with the great warrior mistress Sc√°thach in Alba. She taught him and his foster-brother, Ferdiad, everything the same, except she taught the G√°e Bulg feat only to Cuchulainn. He later used it in single combat against Ferdiad. They were fighting in a ford, and Ferdiad had the upper hand; C√∫chulainn&#x27;s charioteer, L√°eg, floated the &quot;G√°e Bulg&quot; down the stream to his master, who cast it into Ferdiad&#x27;s body, piercing the warrior&#x27;s armor and &quot;coursing through the highways and byways of his body so that every single joint filled with barbs.&quot; Ferdiad died soon after. On a separate occasion, C√∫chulainn also killed his own son, Connla, with the spear. In both instances, it was used as a last resort, as once thrown it proved invariably fatal.

C√∫chulainn&#x27;s use of the G√°e Bulg in the &quot;T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge&quot; exemplifies its deadliness and the gruesome condition in which it leaves its victims. This can be seen in the fact that after it is used, one must literally cut into the victim to retrieve it. This was the case in C√∫chulainn&#x27;s slaying of Ferdiad. As it is stated in Ciaran Carson&#x27;s translation of The T√°in:

==Etymology==
Traditionally, the name has been translated as &quot;belly spear&quot;, with the second element of the name, &quot;bulga&quot;, being treated as a derivative of Old Irish bolg &quot;belly, sack, bag&quot;.

Several notable Celtic scholars, including Joseph Loth and Kuno Meyer, have preferred to derive it rather from Old Irish &quot;bolc&quot; &quot;gap, breach, notch&quot; (cognate with Welsh &quot;bwlch&quot;), suggesting a linguistic link with the second element in the name of Fergus mac R√≥ich&#x27;s sword, &quot;Caladbolg&quot; and King Arthur&#x27;s sword &quot;Caledfwlch&quot;.

Linguist Eric Hamp derives the second element, &quot;bulga&quot;, from a Proto-Celtic compound &quot;*balu-gaisos&quot; meaning &quot;spear of mortal pain/death spear&quot; (comparable to Old Irish &quot;fogha&quot; &quot;spear, dart&quot;, from Proto-Celtic &quot;*uo-gaisu-&quot;). Once the second element &quot;*gaisos&quot; &quot;spear&quot; was no longer recognizable to Irish speakers, its Old Irish cognate, &quot;g√°e&quot;, was reattached to the beginning for clarification, forming a new, tautological compound.

<text>Grannus (also &quot;Granus&quot;, &quot;Mogounus,&quot; and &quot;Amarcolitanus&quot;) was a Celtic deity of classical antiquity. He was regularly identified with Apollo as Apollo Grannus and frequently worshipped in conjunction with Sirona, and sometimes with Mars and other deities.

==Name==
===Etymology===
The theonym &quot;Grannus&quot; is a latinized form of Gaulish &quot;Grannos&quot;. The same stem appears in the personal names &quot;Grania&quot;, &quot;Grannia&quot;, &quot;Grannicus&quot;, and &quot;Grannica&quot;, as well as in the place names &quot;Grignols&quot; (from an earlier *&quot;Granno-ialon&quot; &#x27;Grannus&#x27; clearing&#x27;), &quot;Aquae Granni&quot; (&gt; &quot;Aachen&quot;), and &quot;Gran√©jouls&quot;.

Its etymology remains debated. The name could be connected to Proto-Celtic *&quot;grand&quot;-&quot;/grend-&quot;, meaning &#x27;beard&#x27; (cf. Middle Irish &quot;grend&quot;, Middle Welsh &quot;grann&quot; &#x27;chin, beard, cheek&#x27;, Middle Breton &quot;grann&quot; &#x27;eyebrow&#x27;), although some scholars have pointed that the god is never actually portrayed with a beard. Old French &quot;grenon&quot; (&#x27;small beard&#x27;), Old Spanish &quot;gre√±on&quot; (&#x27;beard&#x27;) and Occitan &quot;gren&quot; (&#x27;moustache&#x27;) are derived from an earlier *&quot;grennos&quot;, that is supposed to be Gaulish, but the vocalism is difficult to reconcile with the other forms.

An alternative etymology connects the name to a reconstructed form *&quot;gra-sn√≥&quot;- (&lt; *&quot;gwhr-sn√≥&quot;-), which could be related to Proto-Celtic &quot;*gwrƒ´ns-&quot;/&quot;gwrens-&quot;, meaning &#x27;heat&#x27; (cf. Middle Irish &quot;grƒ´s&quot; &#x27;heat, glow, embers&#x27;, Middle Welsh &quot;gwres&quot; &#x27;heat [of the sun, fire], passion, lust&#x27;). Scholar J√ºrgen Zeidler contends that this would be a &quot;probable reference to the sun&#x27;s heat and its healing properties&quot;. In early twentieth century scholarship, the theonym was often compared with the Old Irish &quot;gr√≠an&quot; (&#x27;sun&#x27;), which, according to linguist Ranko Matasoviƒá, should be derived from Proto-Celtic *&quot;gwrensƒÅ&quot; (&gt; Primitive Irish &quot;*gwrƒìnƒÅ&quot;).

===Epithets===
At Monthelon, Grannus is called &quot;Deus Apollo Grannus Amarcolitanus&quot; (&quot;The one with a piercing or far-reaching look&quot;), and at Horbourg-Wihr &quot;Apollo Grannus Mogounus&quot;.

In all of his centres of worship where he is assimilated to a Roman god, Grannus was identified with Apollo, presumably in Apollo&#x27;s role as a healing or solar deity. In Trier, he is identified more specifically with Phoebus as Apollo Grannus Phoebus.

==Centres of worship==
One of the god&#x27;s most famous cult centres was at Aquae Granni (now Aachen, Germany). Aachen means ‚Äòwater‚Äô in Old High German, a calque of the Roman name of &quot;Aquae Granni&quot;. The town&#x27;s hot springs with temperatures between 45¬†¬∞C and 75¬†¬∞C lay in the somewhat inhospitably marshy area around Aachen&#x27;s basin-shaped valley region. Aachen first became a curative centre in Hallstatt times.

According to Cassius Dio, the Roman Emperor Caracalla (188 AD to 217 AD) unsuccessfully sought help from Apollo Grannus‚Äîas well as Aesculapius and Serapis‚Äîduring a bout of physical and mental illness, visiting the god&#x27;s shrine and making many votive offerings; Dio claims that the gods refused to heal him because they knew Caracalla&#x27;s intentions to be evil. Caracalla&#x27;s visit to the shrine of ‚Äòthe Celtic healing-god‚Äô Grannus was during the war with Germany in 213.

==Festival==
A 1st century AD Latin inscription from a public fountain in Limoges mentions a Gaulish ten-night festival of Grannus (lightly Latinized as &quot;decamnoctiacis Granni&quot;):
:
:(edit)

Translation: &quot;The vergobretus Postumus son of Dumnorix gave from his own money the &quot;Aqua Martia&quot; (&quot;Water of Martius [or Mars]&quot;, an aqueduct) for the ten-night festival of Grannus&quot;.

==Divine entourage==

The name Grannus is sometimes accompanied by those of other deities in the inscriptions. In Augsburg, he is found with both Diana and Sirona; he is again invoked with Sirona at Rome, Bitburg, Baumberg, Lauingen, and Sarmizegetusa (twice). At Ennetach he is with Nymphs, at Faimingen with Hygieia and the Mother of the Gods, and at Grand with Sol. A votive altar at Astorga invokes him after &quot;holy Serapis&quot; and &quot;the many-named Isis&quot;, and before &quot;the unvanquished Core and Mars Sagatus&quot;.

==Plot==
Sarah Bailey, a troubled teenage girl with unusual abilities, moves from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she befriends a trio of outcast girls who are rumored to be witches. Bonnie Harper bears burn scars, Nancy Downs lives in a trailer with her mother and abusive stepfather, and Rochelle Zimmerman is a black student who is subjected to racist bullying by a group of white girls. The girls worship a powerful earth deity they call &quot;Manon&quot;.

Popular jock Chris Hooker shows interest in Sarah, which she reciprocates. When Bonnie observes Sarah levitating a pencil in class, she and the other outcast girls are convinced that she can complete their coven as &quot;the fourth&quot;, completing an air-water-earth-fire circle and making them all-powerful. As the girls walk home from school, Sarah is harassed by a vagrant, who had earlier tried to scare her with a snake when she moved into her new home. When the vagrant chases after Sarah, he is immediately hit by a car. The girls believe their combined will caused it to happen, which strengthens their bond. It is also revealed that Sarah once attempted suicide.

After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset that he spread a false rumor that they had sex. Sarah casts a love spell on him, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy a spell for power. The spells are successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, Bonnie&#x27;s scars on her back miraculously heal, Laura begins losing her hair, and Nancy causes her stepfather to have a fatal heart attack, enabling her and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move into a luxurious high-rise apartment.

Nancy becomes power-hungry and encourages the others to join her in a rite called &quot;Invocation of the Spirit&quot;, despite being warned against the spell by Lirio, the owner of a local occult shop and practicing witch. Upon completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning. The following morning, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, with beached sharks and other dead animals littering the shore. In the days that follow, Nancy becomes increasingly devoid of empathy and engages in risky behavior that endangers her life and those of others.

The spells the girls cast eventually lead to negative consequences, as Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatized by her baldness, and the obsessed Chris attempts to rape Sarah after she rejects his continual advances. To punish Chris, Nancy uses a glamour spell to disguise herself as Sarah and attempts to seduce him at a party. She is interrupted by the real Sarah, who pleads with Nancy to leave with her. Upset at being deceived, Chris accuses Nancy of jealousy, angering her. She uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.

Sarah unsuccessfully attempts a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, and the coven turns on Sarah. The trio invades Sarah&#x27;s dreams, torment her with visions of swarms of scorpions, snakes, rats, and insects, and make her believe that her family has died in a plane crash. The coven then tries to drive Sarah to suicide. Although initially terrified, Sarah successfully invokes the spirit and manages to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by showing them glamours in a mirror of Bonnie with her face scarred and Rochelle losing her hair like Laura. Sarah then defeats Nancy and binds her, preventing her from causing harm forever.

Bonnie and Rochelle, finding their powers gone, visit Sarah to attempt reconciliation, only to find that she wants nothing to do with them and that Manon took their powers because they abused them. They scornfully mutter that Sarah must have lost her powers too. Sarah then conjures a lightning storm and makes a tree branch nearly crush them. She warns them to be careful not to end up like Nancy, who has been committed to a psychiatric hospital, delusional and her powers bound, strapped to a bed as she desperately insists she can fly.

==Cast==
==Production==
The concept for &quot;The Craft&quot; came from a collaboration between producer Douglas Wick, who wanted to create a film about the high school experience blended with witchcraft, and screenwriter Peter Filardi, who extensively researched the topic and wrote the initial draft. Andrew Fleming was hired to direct and produce the final version of the screenplay.

Eighty-five actresses screen-tested for the four main roles, including Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson and Alicia Silverstone. Rachel True and Fairuza Balk were the first to be cast in their respective roles. The character of Rochelle was re-written to be black when True was cast, and a racism subplot was incorporated as the character&#x27;s major conflict. Robin Tunney was initially cast in the role of Bonnie, but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah, which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former. Neve Campbell, the most well known of the four actresses for her role on &quot;Party of Five&quot;, was then cast as Bonnie. Tunney had shaved her head for her role in &quot;Empire Records&quot; and had to wear a wig throughout filming.

Production enlisted a real-life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as an on-set advisor for the film. She wrote the incantations used and ensured that the treatment of the Wiccan subject-matter was as accurate and respectful as possible.

Filming began on May 1, 1995, and wrapped on July 19, 1995. Shooting took place throughout Los Angeles, including the Los Angeles International Airport, Sunset Boulevard, and Broadway. Verdugo Hills High School was the setting for the fictional Catholic school, St. Benedict&#x27;s Academy; production designer Marek Dobrowolski added different religious statues throughout the building and the grounds. Sarah&#x27;s home in the film was a two-story Spanish mansion and the interiors were built on a soundstage at Culver City Studios. The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in Hollywood Boulevard. The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles, stigmas, religious statues, masks, and tribal dolls were added for effect. Jensen&#x27;s Recreation Center in Echo Park was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations. During filming, an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured; the production&#x27;s medic saw this and called paramedics. The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch, a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find. Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like Griffith Park. The beach summoning took place at Leo Carrillo State Park, which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring.

The makeup effects were designed and created by Tony Gardner and his special effects company Alterian, Inc., which also created the beached sharks for the film.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;The Craft: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; was released on April 30, 1996, by Columbia Records on CD and cassette, one month before the film&#x27;s official theatrical release in the United States. The soundtrack contains a collection of songs, to suit the theme of the movie, from various artists including Heather Nova, Letters to Cleo, and Spacehog. Nova&#x27;s version of &quot;I Have the Touch&quot;, originally performed by Peter Gabriel, which featured during the end credits of the film, was exclusively included on the soundtrack, and is not available as a single, or on any of Nova&#x27;s albums, nor does she perform the song in concert. The tracks in film, titled &quot;Sick Child&quot;, &quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Scorn&quot;, performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees, Connie Francis and Portishead, respectively, were omitted from the soundtrack due to copyright issues from their record labels. However, they were only included in the film as part of an arrangement with PolyGram Film &amp; Television Licensing. An uncredited bonus track, &quot;Bells, Books, and Candles&quot;, composed by Graeme Revell for the film&#x27;s score, was included on the soundtrack.&lt;br&gt;
A follow-up soundtrack, &quot;The Original Motion Picture Score&quot;, was released on June 18, 1996, from Var√®se Sarabande, and contained the film&#x27;s score which was entirely composed and produced by Graeme Revell.

===Track listing===
==Release==
&quot;The Craft&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on May 3, 1996, by Columbia Pictures.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on July 22, 1997, and rereleased on a special edition DVD on September 12, 2000. The film debuted on the Blu-ray format for the first time on October 13, 2009.

The film was given a special collector&#x27;s edition on March 12, 2019, by Shout Factory. Though the new collection of special features was praised, the disc received negative reviews for not remastering the image and simply porting over the old scan from the 2009 disc.

The film was re-released by Shout Factory on 4K UHD on May 17, 2022, for the film&#x27;s 25th Anniversary. The film was given a fresh new 4K scan from the original camera negative.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number one at the North American box office, making US$6,710,995. The movie was a sleeper hit, which Columbia attributed to teenagers and young women, who responded to its themes. According to Box Office Mojo, &quot;The Craft&quot; is the 11th-highest-grossing film since 1980 dealing with the genre of witches.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, 57% of 60 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Craft&quot;‚Ä≥s campy magic often overrides the feminist message at the film&#x27;s core, but its appealing cast and postmodern perspective still cast a sporadic spell&quot;.

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a neatly crafted film that begins most promisingly as a black comedy a la &quot;Heathers&quot;, but gradually succumbs to its tricky machinery of special effects&quot;. Roger Ebert also felt the film was mired in excessive special effects, but praised the performances of the four leads, as did Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; echoed other reviews, praising the first half of the film as a &quot;celebration of adolescent nonconformity and female independence&quot;, but criticized the last half as a &quot;heavy-handed sermon about karma&quot; with &quot;garish&quot; special effects. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a brew of Hawthorne, &quot;Heathers&quot; and Hollywood hocus-pocus&quot; that was nonetheless a &quot;bubbling mess of a movie&quot; that &quot;leaves us more bothered than bewitched&quot;.

The film was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Fairuza Balk for Best Supporting Actress. Balk and Tunney also won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight.

==Legacy==
The film is often labeled a &quot;cult classic&quot; and has acquired a loyal fan base and social media presence. Matthew Jacobs and Julia Brucculieri of the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, writing in 2016, praised &quot;The Craft&quot; for departing from clich√©s of the teen movie genre and incorporating darker themes, saying it became &quot;part of the &#x27;90s teen canon and a cult classic of its own merit.&quot; Kristen Yoonsoo Kim of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine praised the relevance of the film 20 years later, saying it &quot;feels much more progressive than many of the movies that come out today&quot; and calling the viewing of the film &quot;a rite of passage&quot; for young women. Angelica Jade Basti√©n of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Craft&quot; earned a generation of devoted fans because of how it charts the friendship between these four girls ‚Äî its tentative beginnings, the joys of its strength, and its ultimate downfall,&quot; and singled out &quot;Fairuza Balk‚Äôs fierce performance... [as] perhaps &quot;The Craft&quot;‚Ä≥s greatest legacy... She&#x27;s a beguiling and fearsome portrait of female anger.&quot;

In 2013, three of the main actresses, with the exception of Fairuza Balk, reunited for a special Halloween screening of the film at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

&quot;The Craft&quot; served as an inspiration for the 2013 song &quot;Dark Horse&quot; by Katy Perry.

The film can briefly be seen during the end credits of the Marvel Television series &quot;Agatha All Along&quot;.

==Sequel==

A straight-to-DVD sequel was in the works, but it was terminated. In May 2016, Sony Pictures announced that a sequel of &quot;The Craft&quot; was currently in development and it would be written and directed by Leigh Janiak. The announcement of the sequel spawned negative reactions from fans of the original film.

In March 2019, it was announced that the development of the sequel had been taken over by Jason Blum and his Blumhouse Productions company, and it was also announced that the film would be distributed by Columbia Pictures. Zoe Lister-Jones signed on to write the script and direct the film with filming scheduled to begin in July 2019. Daniel Casey later joined the production as screenwriter. In June 2019, Cailee Spaeny was cast as one of the leads. In September 2019, Gideon Adlon, Lovie Simone and Zoey Luna were cast for the remaining three lead roles. In October 2019, David Duchovny joined the cast in an undisclosed role. Later, Michelle Monaghan joined the film in an undisclosed role. Two more casting announcements were made in October 2019, also in undisclosed roles, Nicholas Galitzine and Julian Grey. Filming began on October 22, 2019.

In late September 2020, Sony released an official trailer and announced that instead of a theatrical release, the film would be released on demand everywhere on October 28, 2020.

<doc id="86534" wikidata="Q700106" url="?curid=86534" title="Sirona (goddess)">
<text>In Celtic polytheism, Sirona was a goddess worshipped predominantly in East Central Gaul and along the Danubian limes. A healing deity, she was associated with healing springs; her attributes were snakes and eggs. She was sometimes depicted with Apollo Grannus or Apollo Borvo. She was particularly worshipped by the Treveri in the Moselle Valley.

==Sirona&#x27;s name==
The name of the goddess was written in various ways: &quot;Sirona&quot;, &quot;ƒêirona&quot;, &quot;Íüáirona&quot;, &quot;Thirona&quot;, indicating some difficulty in capturing the initial sound in the Latin alphabet. The symbol ƒê is used here to represent the &quot;tau gallicum&quot;, an additional letter used in Gaulish representing the cluster &quot;ts&quot; which was interchangeable with &quot;st&quot;- in word-initial position and it is not a form of the letter &quot;D&quot;.
The root is a long vowel Gaulish variant of proto-Celtic &quot;*ster-&quot; (&quot;*h2ster&quot;) meaning ‚Äòstar‚Äô. The same root is found in Old Irish as &quot;ser&quot;, Welsh &quot;seren&quot;, Middle Cornish &quot;sterenn&quot; and Breton &quot;steren(n)&quot;.
The name &quot;ƒêirona&quot; consists of a long-vowel, &quot;o&quot;-grade stem &quot;tsƒ´ro-&quot; derived from the root &quot;*ster-&quot; and a &quot;-no-&quot; suffix forming adjectives indicating &quot;a belonging&quot; in many Indo-European languages. Alternatively it may be an augmentative -on- suffix found in many Celtic divine names and epithets. To this is suffixed the Gaulish feminine singular &quot;-a&quot;, the usual feminine variant of o-stem adjectives and nouns. So *&quot;Tsƒ´rona&quot; would seem to have meant ‚Äòstellar‚Äô or ‚Äòastral‚Äô.

==Evidence for Sirona==

The evidence for Sirona is both epigraphic (inscriptions) and representational (sculptures and statues). As the map shows, it is primarily concentrated in east-central Gaul, up to the Germanic lines, and along the Danubian limes as far east as Budapest. A few outliers are seen in Aquitaine, Brittany, and one in Italy. There are no Sirona finds in Britannia, Hispania, or in any of the other Roman provinces.

===Inscriptions===
Some inscriptions, such as those at Bordeaux , Corseul , the three from Ihn in Saarland, Germany , , , Mainz , M√ºhlburg in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Trier (CIL 13, 03662) are to the goddess Sirona alone, &quot;deae ƒêironae&quot;.

More usually, Sirona is paired with Apollo, as in this inscription from Graux in the Vosges mountains:

:&quot;Apollini et Si/ronae / Biturix Iulii f(ilius) / d(edit)&quot;

or this inscription from Luxeuil-les-Bains in Franche-Comt√© :

:&quot;Apollini / et Sironae / idem / Taurus&quot;

When paired with Sirona, Apollo is often assimilated with a Gaulish deity, such as Apollo Borvo or Apollo Grannus. An example from Sarmizegetusa in Dacia :

:&quot;Apollini / Granno et / Sironae / C(aius) Sempronius / Urbanus / proc(urator) Aug(usti)&quot;

and another from Augsburg where Sirona is given the epithet &quot;sancta&quot; (holy) and is identified with Diana:

:&quot;Apollini / Granno / Dianae / [s]anct(a)e Siron(a)e / [p]ro sal(ute) sua / suorumq(ue) / omn(ium) / Iulia Matrona&quot;

A dedication from Gro√übottwar in Baden-W√ºrttemberg can be precisely dated to the year 201 CE by mention of the two consuls, L. Annius Fabianus and M. Nonius Arrius Mucianus:

:&quot;In h(onorem) d(omus) d(ivinae) Apo[lli]ni et Sironae / aedem cum signis C(aius) Longinius / Speratus vet(eranus) leg(ionis) XXII Pr(imigeniae) P(iae) F(idelis) et Iunia Deva coniunx et Lon/gini Pacatus Martinula Hila/ritas Speratianus fili(i) in / suo posuerunt v(otum) s(olverunt) l(ibentes) l(aeti) m(erito) / Muciano et Fabiano co(n)s(ulibus)&quot;

===Depictions===

At the sulphur springs of Alzey in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, a stone bas-relief shows Sirona wearing a long gown and carrying a patera in her right hand and a sceptre in her left. The identification as Sirona is assured by a dedication () to Apollo and Sirona.

The richly furnished spring sanctuary of Hochscheid (Cueppers 1990; Weisgerber 1975) was decorated with statues of Sirona and Apollo, again confirmed by an inscription &quot;Deo Apolli/ni et sanc/t(a)e Siron(a)e ...&quot; (to Apollo and holy Sirona ...). The statue of Sirona shows her carrying a bowl of eggs (Green 1986 p.¬†162) and holding a long snake coiled around her lower arm (a link to the iconography of the Greek healing goddess Hygeia, daughter of Asklepios). She wears a long gown and has a star-shaped diadem on her head (a link with the meaning of the name Sirona).

A bronze statue from M√¢lain in the C√¥te d&#x27;Or and dating to around 280 CE (Deyts &amp; Roussel 1994; Deyts 1998) shows Sirona naked to the waist and holding a snake draped over her left arm, together with a very classical Apollo with lyre. The inscription ( ILingons-M, 00002) is &quot;Thiron(a) et Apollo&quot;.

A stone with an engraved bust of Sirona from Saint-Avold, now in the Mus√©e de Metz, bears an inscription ():
:&quot;Deae ƒêironae/ Maior Ma/giati filius / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)&quot;.

At Vienne-en-Val in the Loiret, a square stone pillar depicts Sirona, Apollo, Minerva and Hercules (Debal 1973). Sirona wears a long dress and a diadem, from which falls a veil. Her left hand holds a cornucopia and in her right is a patera which she is offering to a coiled snake. Again there is a similarity with Hygeia, who also carries a snake. Indeed, when a statue has no inscription, it is not clear whether Sirona or Hygeia is depicted, a syncretism demonstrated by the inscription at Wein () which includes Sirona and Aesculapius, the Roman form of Asklepios:
:&quot;[I(ovi)] O(ptimo) M(aximo) / Apollini / et Sirona[e] / [Ae]sculap[io] / P(ublius) Ael(ius) Luciu/s |(centurio) leg(ionis) X v(otum) s(olvit) / l(ibens) l(aetus) m(erito)&quot;

A different aspect of Sirona is shown at Sainte-Fontaine, where Sirona holds fruit and corn (Green 1986 p.¬†161).

===Temples===

Several temples to Sirona are known. Often these were of the Gallo-Roman fanum type, an inner [cella] with an outer walkway or pronaos, and were constructed around thermal springs or wells, as at Augst (Bakker 1990) and Oppenheim-Nierstein (C√ºppers 1990).

At Budapest (in antiquity, Aquincum) a healing shrine at the spring which fed the aqueduct was dedicated to Apollo (presumably Grannus) and Sirona ()

:&quot;Apolini /et/Serana(e)/ T(itus)Iul(ius) MER/CATOR D(e)C(urio)/V[1]LM&quot;

It was established by the emperor Caracalla when he visited Pannonia, although Dio Cassius says (Roman Histories, 78.15) that the emperor

:&quot;received no help from Apollo Grannus, nor yet from Aesculapius or Serapis, in spite of his many supplications and his unwearying persistence&quot;.

Two inscriptions describe the establishment of temples to Sirona. From Ihn-Niedaltdorf an inscription () records the donation of a building and its furnishings at the dedicant&#x27;s expense:

:&quot;De[ae Sirona]e / aedem [cum suis or]na/mentis M[3] v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) l(aetus) m(erito)&quot;

At Wiesbaden in Hesse (in antiquity, Aquae Mattiacorum) an inscription () records the restoration of a temple by a &quot;curator&quot; at his own expense:

:&quot;Sironae / C(aius) Iuli(us) Restitutus / c(urator) templ(i) d(e) s(uo) p(osuit)&quot;

It seems possible that another Wiesbaden inscription () that the wife of military commander Porcius Rufianus from Mainz dedicated to an otherwise unknown goddess &quot;Diana Mattiaca&quot; for the healing of her daughter Porcia Rufiana, also refers to Sirona:

:&quot;Antonia Postuma / T(iti) Porci Rufiani leg(ati) / [l]eg(ionis) XXII P(rimigeniae) P(iae) F(idelis) [pro sa]lu/te Porciae Rufianae / filiae suae Dianae Mat/tiacae [ex] voto / signum posu[it]&quot;

An elaborate shrine and temple complex at Hochscheid (C√ºppers 1990) has already been mentioned. It was built in the second century CE around a spring, which filled a cistern in the temple. The remote location is thought to have been a pilgrimage site (Weisgerber 1975). It was destroyed in the third century, probably during the Germanic incursions of 250-270, and was never rebuilt.

<text>Gwen Teirbron (French: Blanche; Latin: Alba Trimammis or Candida; possibly English: Wite) was a Breton holy woman and wife of Fragan who supposedly lived in the 5th or 6th century. Her epithet is Welsh for &#x27;(of the) three breasts&#x27;.

==Veneration==
Popular devotion interpreted Gwen&#x27;s unusual physical and spiritual fecundity by God&#x27;s gift to her of a third breast. Her iconography followed suit. Gwen is invoked for women&#x27;s fertility. She is commemorated on 3 October in the Roman Catholic Church (although this has been transferred from Saint Candidus of Rome), and on 18 July (NS) by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in Australia.

==Children==
*Winwaloe, son of Prince Fragan (or Fracan) and Teirbron
*Jacut (or James), son of Prince Fragan and Teirbron
*Wethenoc (or Gwethenoc or Guethenoc), son of Prince Fragan and Teirbron
*Creirwy (or Creirvy or Klervi), daughter of Prince Fragan and Teirbron

<text>The Hooded Spirits or Genii Cucullati are figures found in religious sculpture across the Romano-Celtic region from Britain to Pannonia, depicted as &quot;cloaked scurrying figures carved in an almost abstract manner&quot;. They are found with a particular concentration in the Rhineland (Hutton). In Britain they tend to be found in a triple deity form, which seems to be specific to the British representations.

== Name ==
The name &quot;CucuIlƒÅtus&quot; is a derivative of Gaulish &quot;cucullos&quot;, meaning &#x27;hood&#x27; (cf. &quot;bardo-cucullus&quot; &#x27;bard&#x27;s hood&#x27;), whose etymology remains uncertain. &quot;Cucullos&quot; is the source of Latin &quot;cucullus&quot; and Old French &quot;cogole&quot; (via the Latin feminine form &quot;cuculla&quot;; cf. modern &quot;cagoule&quot;). The Old Irish &quot;cochaIl&quot; (&#x27;monk&#x27;s hood&#x27;), Cornish &quot;cugol&quot;, Breton &quot;cougoul&quot;, and Welsh &quot;kwcwIl&quot; are loanwords from Latin.

== Cult ==
The hooded cape was especially associated with Gauls or Celts during the Roman period. The hooded health god was known as Telesphorus specifically and may have originated as a Greco-Gallic syncretism with the Galatians in Anatolia in the 3rd century¬†BC.

The religious significance of these figures is still somewhat unclear, since no inscriptions have been found with them in this British context. There are, however, indications that they may be fertility spirits of some kind. Ronald Hutton argues that in some cases they are carrying shapes that can be seen as eggs, symbolizing life and rebirth, while Graham Webster has argued that the curved hoods are similar in many ways to contemporary Roman curved phallus stones. However, several of these figures also seem to carry swords or daggers, and Henig discusses them in the context of warrior cults.

Guy de la B√©doy√®re also warns against reading too much into size differences or natures in the figures, which have been used to promote theories of different roles for the three figures, arguing that at the skill level of most of the carvings, small differences in size are more likely to be hit-or-miss consequences, and pointing out that experimental archaeology has shown hooded figures to be one of the easiest sets of figures to carve.

<text>Mitchella is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is found from China to temperate eastern Asia, and from eastern Canada to Guatemala.

The genus &quot;Mitchella&quot; was named by Carl Linnaeus after his friend John Mitchell (1711‚Äì1768), an English physician who lived in America and gave Linnaeus much valuable information on the American flora.

It consists of two species of glabrous or puberulous, creeping, rhizomatous herbs with white axillary flowers with funnel-shaped corollas. They prefer mildly acidic soils, growing in woods near pines, hemlock or mossy hummocks.

The fruits of &quot;Mitchella repens&quot;, known as partridge berries, are eaten in some places.

<doc id="86546" wikidata="Q118192" url="?curid=86546" title="Prester John">
<text>Prester John () was a mythical Christian patriarch, presbyter, and king. Stories popular in Europe in the 12th to the 17th centuries told of a Nestorian patriarch and king who was said to rule over a Christian nation lost amid the pagans and Muslims in the Orient. The accounts were often embellished with various tropes of medieval popular fantasy, depicting Prester John as a descendant of the Three Magi, ruling a kingdom full of riches, marvels, and strange creatures.

At first, Prester John was imagined to reside in India. Tales of the Nestorian Christians&#x27; evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s subcontinental travels as documented in works like the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After the coming of the Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers came to believe that the term was a reference to Ethiopia, by which time it had been an isolated Christian &quot;exclave&quot; distant from any other Christian-ruled territory.

== Origin of the legend ==
Though its immediate genesis is unclear, officially the origin of the legend of Prester John originates from a letter that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos received in 1165. The sender was: &quot;John, Christian Sovereign and Lord of Lords&quot;.

The letter described the very rich lands of this monarch located in central Asia. The king said he lived in an immense palace made of gems and gold and said he governed a huge territory extending from Persia to China. For many years the myth of Prester John was associated with the dream of reaching a sumptuous kingdom, where all material pleasures were fulfilled and people lived in opulence.

The legend of Prester John drew strongly from earlier accounts of the Orient and of Westerners&#x27; travels there. Particularly influential were the stories of Saint Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s proselytizing in India, recorded especially in the third-century work known as the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;. This text inculcated in Westerners an image of India as a place of exotic wonders and offered the earliest description of Saint Thomas establishing a Christian sect there, motifs that loomed large over later accounts of Prester John.

Similarly, distorted reports of movements in Asia of the Church of the East (Nestorianism) informed the legend as well. This church had gained a wide following in the Eastern nations and engaged the Western imagination as an assemblage both exotic and familiarly Christian. Particularly inspiring were the Church of the East&#x27;s missionary successes among the Mongols and Turks of Central Asia; French historian Ren√© Grousset suggests that the Prester John story may have had its origins in the Kerait clan, which had thousands of its members join the Church of the East shortly after the year 1000. By the 12th century, the Kerait rulers were still following a custom of bearing Christian names, which may have fueled the legend.
Additionally, the tradition may have drawn from the shadowy early Christian figure John the Presbyter of Syria, whose existence is first inferred by the ecclesiastical historian and bishop Eusebius of Caesarea based on his reading of earlier church fathers. This man, said in one document to be the author of two of the Epistles of John, was supposed to have been the teacher of the martyr bishop Papias, who had in turn taught Irenaeus. However, little links this figure, supposedly active in the late first century, to the Prester John legend beyond the name. The title &quot;Prester&quot; is an adaptation of the Greek word &quot;œÄœÅŒµœÉŒ≤œçœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ, presbiteros&quot;, literally meaning &quot;elder&quot; and used as a title of priests holding a high office (indeed, &quot;presbyter&quot; is the origin of the English word &quot;priest&quot;).

Later accounts of Prester John borrowed heavily from literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, such as the tale of Sinbad the Sailor. The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, a fabulous account of Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests, was especially influential in this regard.

The Prester John legend as such began in the early 12th century, with reports of visits of an archbishop of India to Constantinople, and of a Patriarch of India to Rome at the time of Pope Callixtus II. These visits, apparently from the Saint Thomas Christians of India, cannot be confirmed, evidence of both being secondhand reports. What is certain is that German chronicler Otto of Freising reported in his &quot;Chronicon&quot; of 1145 that the previous year he had met Hugh, bishop of Jabala in Syria, at the court of Pope Eugene III in Viterbo. 

Hugh was an emissary of Prince Raymond of Antioch, sent to seek Western aid against the Saracens after the Siege of Edessa; his counsel inspired Eugene to call for the Second Crusade. Hugh told Otto, in the presence of the pope, that Prester John, a Nestorian Christian who served in the dual position of priest and king, had regained the city of Ecbatana from the brother monarchs of Media and Persia, the Samiardi, in a great battle &quot;not many years ago&quot;. Afterwards Prester John allegedly set out for Jerusalem to rescue the Holy Land, but the swollen waters of the Tigris compelled him to return to his own country. His fabulous wealth was demonstrated by his emerald scepter; his holiness by his descent from the Three Magi.

Robert Silverberg connects this account with historic events of 1141, when the Qara Khitai khanate under Yel√º Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks in the Battle of Qatwan, near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia at the time and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world; the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. The Qara Khitai at the time were Buddhists, not Christians, and there is no reason to suppose Yel√º Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Qara Khitai practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend. It is also possible that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East. It is possible Otto recorded Hugh&#x27;s confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade&#x27;s European backers ‚Äì according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.

== Letter of Prester John ==
No more of the tale is recorded until about 1165, when copies of what was likely a forged &quot;Letter of Prester John&quot; started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the &quot;Romance of Alexander&quot; and the above-mentioned &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;, the &quot;Letter&quot; was supposedly written to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus by Prester John, descendant of one of the Three Magi and King of India. The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including Hebrew. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, examples of which still exist. The invention of printing perpetuated the letter&#x27;s popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of European exploration. Part of the letter&#x27;s essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastness of Central Asia.

The credence given to the reports was such that Pope Alexander III sent a letter to Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The &quot;Letter&quot; continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter&#x27;s variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At any rate, the &quot;Letter&quot;&#x27;s author was most likely a Westerner.

== Mongol Empire ==
In 1221, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, returned from the disastrous Fifth Crusade with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the Khwarazmian Empire&#x27;s control, and was moving on towards Baghdad as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem. 

Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist Lev Gumilev speculated that the much reduced crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant resuscitated this legend in order to raise Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost interest by that time in getting involved in costly crusades, in a distant region that was far removed from their own states and affairs. The bishop of Acre was correct in thinking that a great king had conquered Persia; however &quot;King David&quot;, as it turned out, was the Tengrist Mongol ruler, Genghis Khan.

The Mongol Empire&#x27;s rise gave Western Christians the opportunity to visit lands that they had never seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the empire&#x27;s secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states&#x27; salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was one reason for the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.

The link between Prester John and Genghis Khan was elaborated upon at this time, as the Prester became identified with Genghis&#x27; foster father, Toghrul, king of the Keraites, given the Jin title Ong Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as Marco Polo, Crusader-historian Jean de Joinville, and the Franciscan voyager Odoric of Pordenone stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Odoric places John&#x27;s land to the west of Cathay en route to Europe, and identifies its capital as &quot;Cosan&quot;, variously interpreted by translators as a number of names and locations. Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a &quot;wise man&quot; who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John. 

William of Rubruck says a certain &quot;Vut&quot;, lord of the Keraites and brother to the Nestorian &quot;King&quot; John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan made off with Vut&#x27;s daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced M√∂ngke, the Khan at the time William wrote. According to Marco Polo&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;, the war between the Prester and Genghis Khan started when Genghis Khan, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John&#x27;s daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis Khan triumphed, and Prester John perished.

The historical figure behind these accounts, Toghrul, was a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis Khan. He had fostered the future Khan after the death of his father Yesugei and was one of his early allies, but the two had a falling-out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis Khan&#x27;s children, the rift between them grew, until war broke out in 1203. Genghis Khan captured Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter of Toghrul&#x27;s brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son Tolui. They had several children, including M√∂ngke, Kublai, Hulagu, and Ariq B√∂ke.

The major characteristic of Prester John tales from this period is the king&#x27;s portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. As the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the empire had provided. In works such as &quot;The Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot; and &quot;Historia Trium Regum&quot; by John of Hildesheim, Prester John&#x27;s domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem &quot;Parzival&quot;, in which the Prester is the son of the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.

A theory was put forward by the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, who suggested that Prester John might be found among the kings of Georgia, which, at the time of Crusades, experienced military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke. The connection with Georgia is unlikely, considering that country was Orthodox, rather than Nestorian, and due to the fact that it and its predecessor states Colchis/Lazica and Iberia were well known and documented at the time, with Episcopoi of Kartli having regular epistolary conversions with Bishops of Rome.

== Ethiopia ==

Prester John had been considered the ruler of India since the legend&#x27;s beginnings, but &quot;India&quot; was a vague concept to the medieval Europeans. Writers often spoke of the &quot;Three Indias&quot;, and lacking any real knowledge of the Indian Ocean they sometimes considered Ethiopia one of the three. Westerners knew that Ethiopia was a powerful Christian nation, but contact had been sporadic since the rise of Islam. No Prester John was to be found in Asia, so Europeans began to suggest that the legend was a reference to the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia. Evidence has suggested that locating Prester John&#x27;s kingdom in Ethiopia entered the collective consciousness around 1250.

Marco Polo had discussed Ethiopia as a magnificent Christian land and Orthodox Christians had a legend that the nation would one day rise up and invade Arabia, but they did not place Prester John there. In 1306, 30 Ethiopian ambassadors from Emperor Wedem Arad came to Europe, and Prester John was mentioned as the patriarch of their church in a record of their visit. Another description of an African Prester John is in the &quot;Mirabilia Descripta&quot; of Dominican missionary Jordanus, around 1329. In discussing the &quot;Third India&quot;, Jordanus records a number of fanciful stories about the land and its king, whom he says Europeans call Prester John.
After this point, an African location became increasingly popular. This may have resulted from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating the possibility of a strategic marriage between the two kingdoms. On 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, P√™ro da Covilh√£ and Afonso de Paiva, were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John. Covilh√£ managed to reach Ethiopia. Although well received, he was forbidden to depart. Contact for the purpose of finding allies, such as with Prester John increasingly fueled early European exploration and colonialism. 

More envoys were sent in 1507, after the island of Socotra was taken by the Portuguese. As a result of this mission, and facing Muslim expansion, regent queen Eleni of Ethiopia sent ambassador Mateus to king Manuel I of Portugal and to the pope, in search of a coalition. Mateus reached Portugal via Goa, having returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with priest Francisco √Ålvares in 1520. Francisco √Ålvares&#x27;s book, which included the testimony of Covilh√£, the &quot;Verdadeira Informa√ß√£o das Terras do Preste Jo√£o das Indias&quot; (&quot;A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies&quot;) was the first direct account of Ethiopia, greatly increasing European knowledge at the time, as it was presented to the pope, published and quoted by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.

By the time Emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had established diplomatic contact with each other in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when Roman Catholic-led council prelates insisted that the Ethiopians should refer to themselves as representatives of their monarch Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob&#x27;s list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.

Ethiopia has been claimed for many years as the origin of the Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been projected upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about Prester John or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until the Portuguese began to circumnavigate around Africa, which is how they reached Ethiopia, via the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Czech Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor Iyasu II about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was &quot;astonished, and told me that the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name.&quot; In a footnote to this passage, Richard Pankhurst states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky&#x27;s inquiry.

==The Americas==
The Italian historian Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera identified the land of Prester John with Chicora in his &quot;Decades of the New World&quot;. 
Francisco de Chicora, a native of what is now South Carolina, who was captured by Spaniards and taken to Spain by Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n, had told Anghiera that his land was ruled by priests.
== End of the legend and cultural legacy ==
Seventeenth-century academics like German orientalist Hiob Ludolf demonstrated that there was no actual native connection between Prester John and the Ethiopian monarchs, and search for the fabled king gradually ceased. But the legend had affected several hundred years of European and world history, directly and indirectly, by encouraging Europe&#x27;s explorers, missionaries, scholars, and treasure hunters.

The prospect of finding Prester John had long since vanished, but the tales continued to inspire through the 20th century. William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1600 play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; contains an early modern reference to the legendary king, as does Tirso de Molina&#x27;s &quot;El Burlador de Sevilla&quot;. In 1910, Scottish novelist and politician John Buchan used the legend in his sixth book, &quot;Prester John&quot;, to supplement a plot about a Zulu uprising in South Africa. This book is an archetypal example of the early 20th-century adventure novel, and proved very popular in its day.

Throughout the rest of the century, Prester John appeared sporadically in pulp fiction and comics. For example, Marvel Comics has featured &quot;Prester John&quot; in issues of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot;. He was a significant supporting character in several issues of the DC Comics fantasy series &quot;Arak: Son of Thunder&quot;. Charles Williams, a member of the 20th-century literary group the Inklings, made Prester John a messianic protector of the Holy Grail in his 1930 novel &quot;War in Heaven&quot;. Prester John and his kingdom feature in two works by Umberto Eco. The first is the 2000 novel &quot;Baudolino&quot;, in which the titular protagonist enlists his friends to write the &quot;Letter of Prester John&quot; for his adoptive father Frederick Barbarossa, but it is stolen before they can send it out. The second is in &quot;Serendipities: Language and Lunacy&quot; (1998) on the chapter &#x27;The Force of Falsity&#x27; where Eco pronounces that the letter from Prester John &quot;... served as an alibi for the expansion of the Christian world...&quot;

In July 1986 issues, Avram Davidson published both a nonfiction essay, &quot;Postscript on Prester John&quot; in Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction (part of his &quot;Adventures in Unhistory&quot; series, and later republished in his 1993 book of that title), and a fantasy short story featuring Prester John&#x27;s realm secretly still ruled by his descendant, &quot;The King Across the Mountains&quot; in Amazing Stories (later republished in &quot;The Adventures of Doctor Eszterhazy&quot;, 1990).

In 1988, Tad Williams&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; of his &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; series would use the name Prester John as the name of the recently deceased High King of the fantasy world of Osten Ard.

He is also mentioned in the Vertigo imprint comic &quot;Fables&quot;.

The first single from American experimental pop band Animal Collective&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Time Skiffs&quot; is called &quot;Prester John&quot;.

==Heraldry==

Various attributed arms have been given to Prester John. The nave of Canterbury Cathedral, which is adorned with heraldic bosses, represents Prester John with &quot;Azure, the Saviour on the Cross or&quot;. In the 16th century, cartographer Abraham Ortelius produced a speculative map of John&#x27;s empire in Africa, featuring &quot;A lion rampant facing to the sinister holding in its paws a quasi-Tau cross of full height&quot;.

<doc id="86564" wikidata="Q725833" url="?curid=86564" title="Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick">
<text>Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick (25 February 1475¬†‚Äì 28 November 1499) was the son of Isabel Neville and George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and a potential claimant to the English throne during the reigns of both his uncle, Richard III (1483‚Äì1485), and Richard&#x27;s successor, Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509). He was also a younger brother of Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury. Edward was tried and executed for treason in 1499.

==Life==

Edward Plantagenet was the son of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and Isabel Neville, who was the elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. Edward was born on 25 February 1475 at Warwick, the family home of his mother. At his christening, his uncle King Edward IV stood as godfather. He was styled as Earl of Warwick from birth, but was not officially granted the title until after his father&#x27;s death in 1478. His potential claim to the throne following the deposition of his cousin Edward V in 1483 was overlooked because of the argument that the attainder of his father barred Warwick from the succession (although that could have been reversed by an act of Parliament). Despite this, he was knighted at York by Richard III in September 1483.

In 1480, Warwick was made a ward of King Edward IV&#x27;s stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, who as his guardian had the power to decide whom he would marry. Clements Markham, writing in 1906, claimed that Richard III had &quot;liberated&quot; Warwick from the Tower of London, where Dorset had placed him; however, there are no contemporary sources for this claim, although Dorset was Constable of the Tower. Dominic Mancini wrote that Richard, on becoming king, &quot;gave orders that the son of the duke of Clarence, his other brother, then a boy of ten years old, should come to the city: and commanded that the lad should be kept in confinement in the household of his wife&quot;.

John Rous (died 1492) wrote that after the death of Richard III&#x27;s only legitimate son, Edward of Middleham, who was Warwick&#x27;s double first cousin (their fathers were brothers and their mothers were sisters), Richard III named Warwick as heir to the throne; however, there is no other evidence for this, and historians have pointed out that it would be illogical for Richard to claim that Clarence&#x27;s attainder barred Warwick from the throne while at the same time naming him as his heir.

==Imprisonment and execution==

Following the death on 16 March 1485 of Richard III&#x27;s queen, Anne, young Edward Plantagenet was vested as Earl of Salisbury by right of his mother Isabel, who had been a co-heiress with Anne to the abeyant earldom. This provided Edward with not just more wealth, but also a claim to the throne. Following Richard III&#x27;s death on 22 August 1485, Warwick, only ten years old, was sent to the Tower of London as a ward of Henry VII. His claim, albeit tarnished, remained a potential threat to Henry, particularly after the appearance of the pretender Lambert Simnel in 1487. In 1490, Henry&#x27;s court confirmed his title of Earl of Warwick despite his father&#x27;s attainder (his claim to the earldom of Warwick being through his mother). He remained a prisoner until 1499, when he became involved (willingly or unwillingly) in a plot to escape with Perkin Warbeck, who had been imprisoned for falsely presenting himself as Richard III&#x27;s nephew, the Duke of York.

On 21 November 1499, Warwick appeared at Westminster in a trial before his peers, presided over by the Earl of Oxford. A week later, Warwick was beheaded for treason on Tower Hill. Henry VII paid for his body and head to be taken to Bisham Abbey in Berkshire for burial. It was thought at the time that Warwick was executed in response to pressure from Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, whose daughter, Catherine of Aragon, was to marry Henry&#x27;s heir, Arthur. Catherine was said to feel very guilty about Warwick&#x27;s death, and believed that her trials in later life were punishment for it.

A number of historians have claimed that Warwick had a mental disability. This conclusion appears entirely based on the chronicler Edward Hall&#x27;s contention that Warwick&#x27;s lengthy imprisonment from a young age had left him &quot;out of all company of men, and sight of beasts, in so much that he could not discern a goose from a capon.&quot;

Upon Warwick&#x27;s death, the House of Plantagenet became extinct in the legitimate male line. However, the surviving sons of his aunt Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, continued to claim the throne for the Yorkist line.

<doc id="86566" wikidata="Q1399704" url="?curid=86566" title="Loucetios">
<text>In Gallo-Roman religion, Loucetios (Latinized as Leucetius) was a Gallic god known from the Rhine-Moselle region, where he was identified with the Roman Mars. Scholars have interpreted his name to mean ‚Äòlightning‚Äô. Mars Loucetius was worshipped alongside the goddess Nemetona.

==Name and etymology==
The name &quot;Loucetios&quot; derives from a Celtic stem *&quot;lowk-et&quot;-, meaning &#x27;flash of lightning, thunderbolt&#x27; (cf. Old Irich &quot;l√≥chet&quot;), itself from the root *&quot;lowk&quot;- (&#x27;bright, light&#x27;; cf. Middle Irish &quot;luach&quot; &#x27;glowing light&#x27;, Middle Welsh &quot;llug&quot; &#x27;eyesight, perception&#x27;). It is the source of the place name &quot;Luzech&quot;, attested as &quot;Luzechium&quot; in 1326 CE.

The name may be a reference to either a Celtic common metaphor for battles as thunderstorms (cf. Old Irish &quot;torannchless&quot;, the &#x27;thunder feat&#x27;), or else the divine aura of the hero (the &quot;l√∫an&quot; of C√∫ Chulainn). It is presumably analogous to Oscan &quot;Loucetius&quot; ‚Äòlight-bringer‚Äô, an epithet of Jupiter.

==Inscriptions and shrines==
About a dozen inscriptions in honour of Mars Loucetius have been recovered, mainly from eastern Gaul, with a particular concentration among the Vangiones and Aresaces (two Rhenish tribes). Inscriptions to him have also been found at Bath and Angers; the altar at Bath specifies that it was dedicated by a citizen of the Treveri.

Inscriptions often invoke Mars Loucetius together with Victoria or Nemetona (or both, in the case of the Eisenberg inscription). Edith Mary Wightman considers this pair ‚Äúclosely similar to if not identical with, Lenus and Ancamna‚Äù, who are known chiefly from the territory of the Treveri adjacent to those of the Aresaces and Vangiones.

Four of the inscriptions to Mars Loucetius are also dedicated &quot;IN H(onorem) D(om≈´s) D(ivinae)&quot;, ‚Äòin honour of the divine house‚Äô (i.e. the imperial family).

Wightman further suggests that the shrine of Mars Loucetius at Klein-Winternheim, south of Mainz, was ‚Äúa central one for the Aresaces‚Äù, the ancient inhabitants of the Mainz-Bingen area.

==Modern literature==

In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;, Leucotios appears in chapter three, during Shadow&#x27;s (the main character) dream of forgotten gods. Gaiman&#x27;s Leucotios is described as a ‚Äúman with ... white hair, with a necklace of teeth about his neck, holding a drum‚Äù.
