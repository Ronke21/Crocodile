<text>Buffalo County is a county located in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,317. Its county seat is Alma. The county was created in 1853 and organized the following year.

==History==

Buffalo County, founded in 1853, is named for the Buffalo River, which flows from Strum to Alma, where it empties into the Mississippi River. The Buffalo River obtained its name from the French voyager Father Louis Hennepin, who named it &quot;Riviere des Boeufs&quot; in 1680. The first permanent settlement was established in 1839, located in what is now Fountain City. This settlement was originally named Holmes&#x27; Landing after a family who traded with the Sioux and Chippewa. Buffalo County was settled primarily by Swiss, German, and Norwegian immigrants who were drawn to the area by the growing lumber industry, fertile soils, access to the Mississippi, and available land. By 1848, a second community was established called Twelve Mile Bluff, which is now known as Alma.

Agriculture developed during the 1850s on top of the ridges where natural prairies and oak savannas occurred, which made working the land much easier. With the lack of good roads, settlement remained along the Mississippi River, where farmers could ship their grain on steamboats. The development of the Northern Rail from Winona, Minnesota, allowed for development away from the river, and by 1890, farmers were transporting their goods predominantly by rail.

The Civil War gave a boost to the local economy with the rising demand for wheat, which was the main crop of the county. The postwar period brought a large influx of settlers; however, because of declining soil fertility, many moved west rather than adopt crop rotation and fertilization. With the price of wheat falling, farmers turned to dairy farming, and by the 1880s, local creameries had started to appear.

==Politics==












Between 1948 and 1984, Buffalo County voted for the nationwide winner in every election with the exception of the very close 1960 election. Then, from 1988 to 2012, like most of the rural counties in southwestern Wisconsin, it backed the Democratic candidate in each election, and did so by more than a 6% margin each time except for 2000 and 2012, which were both decided by less than a 3% margin. The results from 2012 foreshadowed the shift in the electorate in Buffalo County, as in 2016, once again like the rest of rural southwestern Wisconsin, the county dramatically swung to the right, shifting 25 points and giving a 22% victory to Republican Donald Trump. Trump further expanded his margin of victory to over 25% in 2020 and to over 30% in 2024, achieving the two highest vote shares for a Republican in the county since Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1952 landslide victory.

Brown County is one of Wisconsin&#x27;s two original counties, along with Crawford County. It originally spanned the entire eastern half of the state when formed by the Michigan Territorial legislature in 1818. It was named for Major General Jacob Brown, a military leader during the War of 1812.

Several towns along the Fox River vied for the position of county seat in Brown County&#x27;s early years. The first county seat was located at Menomoneeville (now a part of Allouez) in 1824. In 1837, a public referendum relocated the county seat to De Pere. The location was put up for the popular vote again in 1854, resulting in the establishment of the present county seat at Green Bay.

The oldest known tree in Wisconsin, a 1,300 year-old cedar growing on the Niagara Escarpment, was found in Brown County.

==Government==
The legislative branch of Brown County is the 26-member Board of Supervisors. Each member represents a single district and serves a two-year term, with elections held in the spring of even-numbered years. The Board of Supervisors elects a Chairman and Vice Chairman from its membership.

The executive branch of Brown County is the County Executive, who is elected in the spring of every other odd-numbered year. The executive appoints department heads with the approval of the County Board. The current county executive is Troy Streckenbach.

Brown County has several other elected officials that are established under the Wisconsin State constitution and are referred to as the &quot;constitutional officers&quot;. Constitutional officers are the only partisan elected officials within Brown County government, as the Executive and County Board are non-partisan positions.

The current constitutional officers are:
* County Executive: Troy Streckenbach (Independent)
* Clerk: Sandy Juno (R)
* Clerk of Circuit Courts: John Vander Leest (R)
* District Attorney: David L. Lasee (R)
* Register of Deeds: Cheryl Berken (R)
* Sheriff: Todd Delain (R)
* Treasurer: Paul Zeller (R)

In July 2002, the county declared English its official language, voting 17–8 to do so and to increase spending to promote fluency in English.

==Politics==












Ashland County is consistently Democratic. It has voted for the Democrat in every presidential election since 1932, with the exceptions of 1952 and 1956 when it backed Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s two successful bids for the presidency.

Despite Ashland County&#x27;s Democratic leanings, three consecutive district attorneys of Ashland County in the 1990s and early 2000s, each elected as Republicans, went on to hold major positions in state or federal politics. J.B. Van Hollen, district attorney from 1993 to 1999, later served as United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin in the administration of President George W. Bush and as Attorney General of Wisconsin from 2007 to 2015. Van Hollen&#x27;s successor as district attorney, Michael Gableman, who served from 1999 to 2002, was later a justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court from 2008 to 2018. Gableman&#x27;s successor as district attorney, Sean Duffy, who served from 2002 to 2010, served as the U.S. representative for Wisconsin&#x27;s 7th congressional district from 2011 to 2019 and is the current United States Secretary of Transportation.

<text>Wyoming County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,382. Its county seat is Pineville. The county was created in 1850 from Logan County and named for the Lenape word meaning &quot;large plains&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. The county is drained by the branches of Sandy and Guyandotte rivers. The land surface is mountainous.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Wyoming County was divided into six districts: Barkers Ridge, Center, Clear Fork, Huff Creek, Oceana, and Slab Fork. A seventh district, Baileysville, was created from portions of Clear Fork and Huff Creek in 1881. Except for minor adjustments, the seven historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged for over a century. In the 1990s, they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.

<text>Wood County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 84,296, making it West Virginia&#x27;s fifth-most populous county. Its county seat is Parkersburg. The county was formed in 1798 from the western part of Harrison County and named for James Wood, governor of Virginia from 1796 to 1799.

Wood County is part of the Parkersburg-Vienna, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Wood County was formed on December 21, 1798, from portions of Harrison County. It was named for the then Governor of Virginia (1796–99), James Wood, formerly a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1861, Virginia seceded from the Union. The delegates of the 40 western counties who opposed secession formed their own government and seceded from the Confederate state of Virginia. West Virginia was granted statehood in 1863.

Later that year, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Wood County was divided into ten districts: Clay, Harris, Lubeck, Parkersburg, Slate, Steele, Tygart, Union, Walker, and Williams.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.8%) is water.

Wood County&#x27;s northern and western boundary is the Ohio River. The Little Kanawha River flows northwestward through the county to its mouth at the Ohio River in Parkersburg. Tributaries of the Little Kanawha River in Wood County include Worthington Creek, Tygart Creek, and Walker Creek.

<text>Wirt County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,194, making it the least populous county in West Virginia. Its county seat is Elizabeth. The county was created in 1848 by the Virginia General Assembly and named for U.S. Attorney General and presidential candidate William Wirt. The county is served by one high school, Wirt County High School.

Wirt County is part of the Parkersburg-Vienna, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Wirt County was created from parts of Jackson and Wood counties on January 19, 1848. The county was named after William Wirt (1772–1834).

The first European pioneer was William Beauchamp (1743–1808), a veteran of the Continental Navy and a Methodist minister. Beauchamp arrived in 1796 with a claim to 1400 acres on the Little Kanawha River. He farmed, built a mill, and laid out the town of Elizabeth, named after his daughter.

Burning Springs was the site of an oil rush in the 1860s. In 1863 the town was burned, along with 100,000 gallons of oil, by Confederate cavalrymen.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Wirt County was one of fifty Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia. Later that year, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Wirt County was divided into seven districts: Burning Springs, Clay, Elizabeth, Newark, Reedy, Spring Creek, and Tucker. Except for minor adjustments, the seven historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged for over a century. In the 1980s, they were consolidated into three new districts: Central, Northeast, and Southwest.

Wetzel County was divided into six districts: Center, Church, Grant, Green, Magnolia, and Proctor. A seventh district, Clay, was formed in the 1880s. New Martinsville, the county seat, was in Magnolia District.

==Politics==
Wetzel County was a rarity among northern West Virginia counties in supporting secession at the Virginia Secession Convention, and it reliably supported Democratic presidential candidates for the next ninety years. The first Republican to carry Wetzel County was Herbert Hoover in 1928 due to anti-Catholicism, but the county afterwards stayed Democratic until 1952. Since that time Wetzel County has followed the politics of West Virginia: a Democratic-leaning state up to the Clinton Era, after which the Democratic Party&#x27;s consistent shift to social-liberal positions and support of green policies – an antithesis to the region&#x27;s traditional economy – have caused Wetzel County to trend rapidly toward the Republican Party.










==Local lore==

In the mid-to-late 19th century a band similar to the James Gang of legend existed that was known as the Jennings Gang. A number of robberies and murders were accounted to this gang. They were known to be located near the head of Doolin Run near Tarpan Ridge. The home they occupied was found to have an escape tunnel that had been used to escape capture on several occasions. A local group of citizens known as the &quot;Redmen&quot; ultimately cornered the gang at this home and a number of the members were killed. A detailed description exists in the Wetzel County History written approximately in 1900.

The oldest oil well location known is of one drilled on Long Run near Doolin Run which reached oil at a depth about 360 ft.

Wetzel County has a long history in the Oil and Gas producing industry. During the Oil boom of the 19th century it is reported that the Proctor Creek watershed had 12 saloons and numerous livery/hotels to accommodate the hundreds of logging and oil field workers.

<text>Webster County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,378. Its county seat is Webster Springs. The county was founded in 1860 and named for Daniel Webster.

==History==
Webster County was formed from parts of Nicholas, Braxton, and Randolph counties in Virginia through the approval of an act of the Virginia General Assembly during its 1859-1860 session. Movement toward the formation of this county began in 1851.

Webster became part of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. When the state was formed, each county was divided into multiple civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, so in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts.

Webster County&#x27;s three original townships, subsequently magisterial districts, were Fork Lick, Glade, and Holly. A fourth district, Hacker Valley, was formed from part of Holly District in 1876. The four historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: Central, Northern, and Southern.

<text>Wayne County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 38,982. Its county seat is Wayne. The county was founded in 1842 and named for General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne. Wayne County is part of the Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Wayne County, West Virginia was originally Wayne County, Virginia, which was created from part of Cabell County in 1842. The county was named for General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne.

===Settlement===
Due to the constant threat of Indian attack, there were no European settlers in the area that became Wayne County until after 1794. The area was made safe for European settlers in 1794 through the defeat of the Shawnee at the Battle of Fallen Timbers by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne.

When the first permanent European settlers came to Wayne County around the year 1800, the area was part of Kanawha County. Most of the original pioneer settlers were self-sufficient farmers. They raised their own food, sheep for wool clothing, and made their buildings, furnishings and tools out of the surrounding forest. A few trading posts provided the manufactured goods the pioneers could not make for themselves. Later, grist mills at Wayne, Dickson, south of East Lynn and at Lavalette ground their corn into meal and their wheat into flour.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Wayne was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Wayne County was divided into five districts: Butler, Ceredo, Grant, Lincoln, and Union. A sixth district, Stonewall, was formed from part of Grant District in 1878. In the 1920s, Westmoreland was created as the county&#x27;s seventh magisterial district. Grant District was discontinued between 1960 and 1970, followed by Lincoln in the 1980s.

<text>Sergei Sergeyevich Bodrov (; December 27, 1971 – September 20, 2002), also known as Sergei Bodrov Jr., was a Russian actor and screenwriter who had lead roles in the films &quot;Brother&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of the Mountains&quot;, &quot;East/West&quot; and &quot;Brother 2&quot;. He was the son of the Russian playwright, actor, director and producer Sergei Bodrov. He died in the Kolka–Karmadon rock ice slide at the end of the second day of shooting of his film &quot;The Messenger&quot;.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Sergei Bodrov was born on December 27, 1971, in Moscow. His father is a film director, Sergei Bodrov, and his mother Valentina Nikolayevna was a fine art expert. His father was of mixed Russian, Tatar, and Buryat ancestry, while his mother had Belarusian roots. Sergei Bodrov Jr. believed that &quot;childhood is the most important and the most amazing time in life.&quot; and what you&#x27;ll become happens in the first sixteen years&quot;. Various publications report that Bodrov wanted to become a garbageman and drive an orange car.

Bodrov wrote about his early years and events which influenced his worldview in a &quot;Composition on the Theme: Eight Events which Influenced Me, or How I Grew Up to Be a Good Person.&quot;

=== Education ===
Sergei Bodrov attended the special French-language School No. 1265. In December 2012, a memorial plaque was installed in the school in his memory.

Bodrov wanted to enrol in the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, but his father advised him that &quot;cinema is a passion, and if you don&#x27;t feel it you should either wait for it or forget about it forever.&quot; Instead, in 1989 he enrolled in the art history program in the History Department of Moscow State University, graduating with Honors and remaining for postgraduate studies, although he already knew that he would not work in a museum or library. In his own words, at the university, he &quot;learned to see beauty in the simple things around us&quot;. After becoming an actor and television host he completed and defended (in 1998) his graduate thesis entitled &quot;Architecture in Venetian Renaissance Painting&quot; and received the Candidate of Sciences degree.

In 1991, while still a student, Bodrov studied art in Italy, where he found work as a lifeguard and earned money to support his travels around the country. When he was asked in an interview if his education was useful in his life, he answered: &quot;Of course. So you come to a city. What do you usually know about it? That there is a central square, some shops... And I know there is a painting in one of the museums and that you can spend the whole day in front of. And this day is added to your life.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Early roles ===
Sergei&#x27;s first role as an actor was in &quot;Freedom is Paradise&quot; in 1989, directed by his father. He appeared on screen only for a few minutes, playing a minor lawbreaker who was waiting for a decision on his own fate while sitting next to the main hero of the film. During his university days, he also had a bit role as a bellhop in the 1992 movie &quot;White King, Red Queen&quot;.

=== Prisoner of the Mountains ===
In 1995, his father travelled to Dagestan for the filming of his movie &quot;Prisoner of the Mountains&quot;. Bodrov asked to go with him, prepared to do any available work. Unexpectedly, he became one of the featured actors, playing the conscript Vanya Zhilin, partnered with Oleg Menshikov who played the regular soldier Alexey Ryapolov. Bodrov received an award for best actor jointly with Menshikov at the Kinotavr cinema festival in Sochi.

Bodrov himself did not claim to be an actor: &quot;I always say everywhere: I&#x27;m not an actor, I&#x27;m not an actor, I&#x27;m not an actor. And I hear: &quot;No, you&#x27;re an actor&quot;. And I say that an actor is quite a different thing. Actors are different, it&#x27;s a different temperament. A role for me is not a profession. It&#x27;s something that you do.&quot;

=== Vzglyad ===
From October 1996 to August 1999, Bodrov was the host of the program &quot;Vzglyad&quot; on Channel One. He said that he left the show feeling it had given him a good schooling:&quot;I became acquainted with so many people, heard so many stories, read so many letters - it doesn&#x27;t happen in other jobs. It had a very positive charge. Help two or three people and the telecast has done some good. But it has to be done responsibly.&quot;

In 1997 Sergei married Svetlana Mikhailova (author of the television projects &quot;Wordsmiths&quot; and &quot;Canon&quot;). In 1998 their daughter Olga was born, followed in 2002 by a son, Alexander.

=== Brother ===
During the 1996 Sochi film festival, Sergei Bodrov made the acquaintance of director Aleksei Balabanov, who invited him to the STW film studio. It was here that &quot;Brother&quot; was being filmed for release in 1997. Sergei played the starring role, Danila Bagrov. The movie was criticized by the media, accused of racism and Russophobia (as a film made for foreign audiences). Bodrov himself assessed his character in the following way: &quot;I know that Danila is often reproached for being primitive, simple and inarticulate. And in part, I agree with that. But a metaphor connected with him forms in my mind: I imagine people in a primitive chaos, who sit in their cave before the fire and do not understand anything else in their life except for the responsibility to eat and to reproduce. And suddenly one of them stands up and utters very simple words about how it is necessary to stand up for their friends, to respect women, to defend one&#x27;s brother.&quot;

The music to the movie was composed by the Russian rock band Nautilus Pompilius, which Sergei himself enjoyed listening to.

Despite some controversy, the movie received critical acclaim and won an award at the film festival in Sochi, a Special Jury Award and the FIPRESCI Award at the international festival in Turin, the same awards in Cottbus, and the Grand Prix in Trieste. Bodrov received the award for Best Actor at the movie festivals in Sochi and Chicago and got the &quot;Golden Aries&quot; prize.

The movie was regarded by many in Russia as culturally significant and for many of the younger generation, Bodrov&#x27;s character Danila Bagrov became a hero and a role model.

=== Other roles ===
Over the course of 1998–99, Sergei starred in two relatively minor films, the first was in Pavel Pavlikovsky&#x27;s movie, a joint UK-Russia production, &quot;The Stringer&quot;, with British actress Anna Friel. Bodrov played Vadik Chernyshov, an impoverished &#x27;stringer&#x27;, who dreams of filming something to interest the western news channels. Friel played the role of Helen, a British media executive, as the two begin a romance against the backdrop of the world of journalism, and cultural differences, in the romantic thriller. The second was in Régis Wargnier&#x27;s movie &quot;East/West&quot;, in which Sergei played Sasha, a neighbour of the central couple in the film, Dr Golovin and his French wife Marie, in a communal apartment during the Stalin era.

In 2000, the movie &quot;Brother 2 (Brat 2)&quot; was released, with Bodrov again playing Danila Bagrov. Critics attacked the movie as they had its predecessor, saying that it expressed racist ideas, threatened national security and insulted the Ukrainian and American nations. Bodrov responded: &quot;What was important for us was not to say that all Americans are jerks, but the opposite, that we are not freaks. This is a fairly simple idea, so it is strange that not everyone understands it. The Americans make movies about Russians where Schwarzenegger as a policeman tears off a mafioso&#x27;s wooden leg and drugs fall out of it, and bears are walking in the streets. In other words, we [Russians] are complete lame-brains. So why don&#x27;t we have the right make a joke at the expense of the Americans?&quot;

In 2001, Bodrov moved to California to take part in the shooting of his father&#x27;s movie &quot;The Quickie&quot;. Sergei played Dima – the head of security for a rich American of Russian ancestry – Oleg (Mashkov). In Bodrov&#x27;s free time during the filming of &quot;The Quickie&quot;, he wrote the screenplay for his first movie &quot;Sisters&quot;. His father suggested the idea of the movie to him and Bodrov Jr wrote the screenplay in two weeks; four days later filming began. The heart of the movie is a story of two sisters – Sveta (thirteen years old) and Dina (eight), who become inadvertent victims of their father&#x27;s criminal past. Sergei played a small part, in a role without an available actor. The film opened on May 10, 2001. At a festival in Sochi, it received a Grand Prix award &quot;for the best debut&quot; and the young actresses received a jury award for their parts.

In the autumn of 2001, Bodrov became a host of the game show &quot;Last Hero&quot;. Sixteen people landed on an island near the coast of Panama and competed in various trials. The last participant to survive all the votes received the main prize of three million rubles. Bodrov conducted the game and provided the commentary. He gave his understanding of the telecast: &quot;I think that the subject of hunger and physical existence will emerge in front of them very seriously. But the true survival lies in how you&#x27;re strong inside, how you can keep your humanity in inhuman conditions. And this is also related to me.&quot;

The shooting of Balabanov&#x27;s movie &quot;War&quot; began in the spring of 2001. Bodrov had a role of short duration (he played captain Medvedev). The opening night was in 2002. The movie got the &quot;Golden Rose&quot; award at the Kinotavr festival and Bodrov received the Nika Award for the best supporting role.

&quot;Bear&#x27;s Kiss&quot; directed by his father Sergei Bodrov opened on November 28, 2002. Bodrov played Misha, a bear who mystically transforms into a person. Sergei&#x27;s love interest in the film is played by Rebecka Liljeberg.

=== &quot;The Messenger&quot; ===
In July 2002, Bodrov settled down to shoot his second film, with the working title &quot;The Messenger&quot;. He characterized the movie in the following words: &quot;Philosophic-mystical parable about the life of two friends. They are romantics, travelers, and venturers. Of course, there will be bandits, hostages, in general, all that accompanies us in life. The movie is called &#x27;The Messenger&#x27; and I&#x27;m like a coffee in a carton in it: the author of a screenplay, stage manager and performer of the leading role.&quot;&quot;

The film crew arrived in Vladikavkaz in September, and on September 20 were filming the scenes in a women&#x27;s penal colony in Vladikavkaz where they intended to shoot the scenes of the main character&#x27;s return from the army. At approximately 7 p.m., filming stopped due to poor lighting conditions. An ice slide then occurred, where a block of ice fell from Mount Jimara onto the Kolka Glacier, bringing with it mud and large boulders. This mudflow covered Karmadon Gorge, where the film crew were working. A massive search and rescue operation proved fruitless. 135 people were killed, including Bodrov.

== In popular culture ==

Reflecting Bodrov&#x27;s stature as a cultural icon in Russia, there are several murals across the country, notably in Saint Petersburg, with Bodrov&#x27;s image from the film &quot;Brother&quot;. There are also tours around Saint Petersburg to the filming locations of &quot;Brother&quot;.

<text>Upshur County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,816. Its county seat is Buckhannon. The county was formed in 1851 from Randolph, Barbour, and Lewis counties and named for Abel Parker Upshur, a distinguished and jurist of Virginia. Upshur served as United States Secretary of State and Secretary of the Navy under President John Tyler.

The highest elevation in Upshur County is 3,160 feet, near Sugar Run on the Randolph and Upshur County lines just outside Palace Valley and Hemlock. It is reported there as an elevation marker at the site.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Upshur County was divided into six districts: Banks, Buckhannon, Meade, Union, Warren, and Washington. In the 1990s, the six historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: First, Second, and Third.

==Politics==
Whereas most of West Virginia has seen a rapid and continuing shift to the Republican Party since the 1990s, Upshur County—though strongly Democratic during the Second Party System—has ever since statehood been a Republican stronghold due to its powerful Unionist sympathies from Civil War days, and the association of the Democratic Party with the “Slave Power” and creating a war the yeoman residents had no desire to fight. The solitary post-Civil War Democrat to win the county has been Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and he won by only 168 votes. Since 1896, only two other Democrats—Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1996—have topped forty percent in the county.










==Economy==
Economy includes coal mining and timber, as well as higher education—the Upshur County seat of Buckhannon is home to the small, private, liberal arts institution West Virginia Wesleyan College. The West Virginia State Wildlife Center in French Creek also generates some income as a popular tourist attraction. Upshur County also gained international attention during the Sago Mine disaster in 2006; the blast and ensuing aftermath trapped 13 coal miners for nearly two days, only one of whom survived.

<text>Tyler County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,313. Its county seat is Middlebourne. The county was founded in 1814 and is named after John Tyler, Sr., father of President John Tyler.

==History==
The earliest white hunters (mainly of Scotch-Irish, English, and German descent) settled in what later became Tyler County in 1792 near the present town of Friendly. This area on the banks of the Ohio River was former Indian hunting grounds.

Tyler County was officially formed from a portion of what was then Ohio County, Virginia, on December 6, 1814. The following year, Middlebourne (founded 1798) became the county seat. This vast area was diminished over the years: in 1845 a small portion went the newly established Doddridge County; in 1846 the northern half went to make up the new Wetzel County; and in 1851 the southern third went to Pleasants County.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Tyler was one of fifty Virginia counties that entered the Union as the state of West Virginia. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Tyler County was divided into six districts: Centreville, Ellsworth, Lincoln, McElroy, Meade, and Union. Except for minor adjustments, these districts were largely unchanged until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into four new magisterial districts: Central, North, South, and West. The names and boundaries of the historic magisterial districts continued to exist in the form of tax and assessment districts.

==Geography==

==Politics==
After having leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party between the New Deal and Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, most of West Virginia has since 2000 seen an extremely rapid swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization. In contrast, Tyler County, along with neighboring Doddridge County and Ritchie County were historically powerfully Unionist and have been rock-ribbed Republican since the Civil War. The only Democratic presidential candidates to have won Tyler County since West Virginia&#x27;s statehood are Woodrow Wilson in 1912, who won by just 64 votes, and Bill Clinton in 1996. Clinton&#x27;s win in 1996 is the last time a Democrat has tallied 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and one of only three times the Democrats have done so since Franklin Roosevelt.

<text>Tucker County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,762, making it West Virginia&#x27;s fourth-least populous county. Its county seat is Parsons. The county was created in 1856 from a part of Randolph County, then part of Virginia. In 1871, a small part of Barbour County, was transferred to Tucker County. The county was named after Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., a judge and Congressman from Williamsburg, Virginia.

==History==
Tucker County was created in 1856 from a part of Randolph County, then part of Virginia. In 1861, as a result of the Wheeling Convention, Tucker County joined the rest of West Virginia in breaking away from Virginia to remain a part of the Union.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Tucker County was initially divided into three townships: Black Fork, Hannahsville, and St. George, which became magisterial districts in 1872. The following year, Hannahsville became Licking District, and in 1876, two new magisterial districts were formed: Clover from part of St. George, and Dry Fork from part of Black Fork. A sixth district, Fairfax, was organized in the 1880s, followed by a seventh, Davis, formed in the 1890s from parts of Dry Fork and Fairfax Districts.

Between 1889 and &#x27;93, a dispute known as the Tucker County Seat War took place between the people in the town of Parsons and that of St. George, over the location of the county seat. Although nobody was killed in the &quot;war&quot;, the situation came to a climax when a mob of armed men from Parsons marched on St. George and took the county records by force.

Beginning in 1907, the Babcock Lumber Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while operating out of Davis, West Virginia, clear cut the mountain ridges throughout Tucker Country. This clear cutting, with its residual slashings, converted the landscape into a &quot;tinderbox&quot;. By 1910, fires burned continuously — in some areas for years on end, from spring until the first snows — leaving little other than thin mineral soil and bare rock. In 1914, with the county virtually denuded of standing trees, the ground burned continually for 6 months. As a result, top soils that once produced huge timbers on the mountainsides — including the largest tree ever harvested in West Virginia, a white oak some 13 feet in diameter just 10 feet from the ground — washed down into the narrow valleys and bottom lands, which had always been too narrow for harvesting productive crops or livestock. Uncontrollable soil erosion and flooding further degraded and depopulated the region. To this day, Tucker County and surrounding regions bear the scars of this remarkable conflagration.

<text>Taylor County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,705. Its county seat is Grafton. The county was formed in 1844 and named for Senator John Taylor of Caroline. Taylor County is part of the Clarksburg, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
This area was populated by the Adena culture in the Pre-Columbian Woodland period of the Native Americans in the United States.

Some of the first Europeans to visit the area are thought to have been British Army deserters from Fort Pitt, who reportedly fled their post in 1761 during the French and Indian War and roamed northwestern Virginia for several years thereafter. A European trader with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company reportedly set foot in these lands as early as 1764.

Pruntytown is the oldest (&quot;ca.&quot; 1798) known white settlement in what is now Taylor County. Initially known as Cross Roads, on January 1, 1801, it was renamed Williamsport in honor of Abraham Williams, a longtime resident. The name was changed again on January 23, 1845, to honor pioneer settler John Prunty, Sr (1745-1823) and son David. This town served as the county seat of government from the county&#x27;s founding in 1844 until a county election in 1878 moved that honor to Grafton, West Virginia.

The county was established by the Virginia General Assembly on January 19, 1844. It was formed out of parts of Barbour, Harrison, and Marion counties in Virginia. Most historians think the county was named after John Taylor (1753-1824) of Caroline County, Virginia, while a minority believe it was named after Zachary Taylor. Fifteen justices were appointed by Governor James McDowell to organize the newly formed county: John Asbury, Frederick Burdett, Dr. Joseph L. Carr, John Cather, John A. Guseman, Nathan Hall, Calder Haymond, Absalom Knotts, John Leeper, Charles W. Newlon, Jonathan Poe, Robert Reed, Joshua A. Robinson, William A. Rogers, and Benjamin Sinclair.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Taylor was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Taylor County was initially divided into nine townships: Booths Creek, Clay, Court House, Fetterman, Flemington, Grafton, Haymond, Union, and Webster. Grafton Township was co-extensive with the town of Grafton.

In 1871, Union Township was annexed by Grafton Township; the following year, Clay and Webster Townships were annexed by Court House Township, Haymond was annexed by Fetterman, and the five remaining townships were converted to magisterial districts. In the 1880s, Knottsville District was created from the part of Grafton District that lay outside the town of Grafton. Except for minor adjustments, the six historic districts remained largely unchanged for the next ninety years, until in the 1970s they were consolidated into three new magisterial districts: Central, Eastern, and Western. In the 1990s, Central District was renamed, becoming Tygart.

The West Virginia Equal Suffrage Association was founded in November 1895 at the Taylor County Courthouse after a meeting called by leaders of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
Anna Jarvis, the founder of the Mother&#x27;s Day, was a native of Taylor County, which is now home to the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine.

<text>Summers County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,959. Its county seat is Hinton. The county was created by an act of the West Virginia Legislature on February 27, 1871, from parts of Fayette, Greenbrier, Mercer and Monroe counties and named in honor of George W. Summers (1804–1868).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.0%) is water.

After gaining independence from Virginia in 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Summers County was initially divided into five townships: Forest Hill, Greenbrier, Green Sulphur, Jumping Branch, and Pipestem. Forest Hill consisted of territory received from Monroe County, where it had been part of a township of the same name. Greenbrier was also formed from territory that had been part of Monroe County. Green Sulphur was formed from territory received from Fayette and Greenbrier Counties, while Jumping Branch and Pipestem consisted of land received from Mercer County.

As the second-last of West Virginia&#x27;s counties to be created, Summers County had townships for only a year before they were converted into magisterial districts. In 1879, Talcott District was organized from part of Greenbrier. The six historical districts remained largely unchanged for the next century, until in the 1970s they were consolidated into three new magisterial districts: Bluestone River, Greenbrier River, and New River.

==Politics==
Like most of heavily secessionist Southern West Virginia, Summers County was powerfully Democratic for the century-and-a-third following West Virginia statehood. It voted Republican only in the landslide wins of 1920, 1928 (aided by powerful anti-Catholic sentiment against Al Smith), 1972 and 1984. Like all of West Virginia there has been since 2000 a dramatic swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social issues.

<text>Roane County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,028. Its county seat is Spencer. The county was founded in 1856 and is named for Spencer Roane.

==History==
Roane County was created by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on March 11, 1856. It was named for the jurist Spencer Roane of Virginia. He was born in Essex County April 4, 1762. The county&#x27;s seat Spencer was also named for Judge Roane.

On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Roane was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia. Later that year, the state&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Roane County was divided into seven districts: Curtis, Geary, Harper, Reedy, Smithfield, Spencer, and Walton. Except for minor adjustments, these districts were largely unchanged for more than a century, until in the 1980s they were consolidated into three new magisterial districts: Northern, Eastern, and Western. A fourth district, Southern, was added in the 1990s.

<text>Ritchie County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,444. Its county seat is Harrisville. The county was created in 1843 by the Virginia General Assembly and named for Richmond newspaper publisher Thomas Ritchie.

==History==
Ritchie was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. Later that year, the new state&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Ritchie County was divided into four districts: Clay, Grant, Murphy, and Union.

In 1911, historian Minnie Kendall Lowther published &quot;The History of Ritchie County.&quot; Her book is still regarded as one of the most comprehensive histories of any county in West Virginia.

==Geography==

==Politics==
After having leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party between the New Deal and Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, most of West Virginia has since 2000 seen an extremely rapid swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization along with views on environmental, social and cultural issues increasingly at odds with the national Democratic party. In contrast, Ritchie County along with neighbouring Doddridge County and Tyler County were historically powerfully Unionist and have always been solidly Republican since the Civil War. Only one Democratic presidential nominee has carried Ritchie County since West Virginia&#x27;s statehood: Woodrow Wilson in 1912, and he won by a mere six votes with only 34.22 percent of all votes against a Republican Party mortally divided between conservative incumbent Taft and progressive Theodore Roosevelt.

The first attempt by Europeans to settle in present-day Randolph County came in 1752 or &#x27;53 when David Tygart — for whom the Tygart Valley River was named — and Robert Foyle (later called Files) located (separately) with their families in the vicinity of present-day Beverly. Although there had been no recent history of conflicts between Europeans and Native Americans in that immediate area, that summer a party of Native Americans traveling the Shawnee Trail discovered the Foyle cabin and killed seven members of the family. One son escaped and alerted the Tygart family, allowing all to escape. (The Tygart-Foyle settlements were the first European settlements attempted anywhere within the Monongahela River watershed in present-day West Virginia.) No other European settlement was attempted in present Randolph County until 1772.

Thomas Skidmore (&quot;ca.&quot; 1733–1807), born in Maryland, obtained a title to 400 acres of land (“by virtue of a settlement”) in the future Elkins area before 1778. This land, on the east side of the Tygart Valley River, was surveyed by John Poage in 1780 and included the land that is now most of downtown Elkins. Thus, Skidmore was probably the first European settler in what became Elkins.

When Randolph County, Virginia (now West Virginia) was created out of the vast Harrison County on October 16, 1787, it included not only present-day Randolph County, but parts of what are now eight other counties. It took its name from the surname of the then Governor of Virginia. The name of the new county seat, originally Randolph Court House, or Edmundton (the latter from the Governor&#x27;s given name), was changed to Beverly by 1790. Beverly remained the county seat until 1890 when county government was moved to Elkins.

Minor actions of the American Civil War which took place in Randolph County include the Battle of Rich Mountain and a part of the Battle of Cheat Mountain, both in 1861. These operations came in the course of the Western Virginia Campaign.

Randolph was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. Later that year, the new state&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Randolph County was divided into nine districts: Beverly, Clarke, Clay, Dry Fork, Green, Mingo Flats, Reynolds, Scott, and Union. Several of these were renamed during the 1870s: Clark became Valley Bend, Clay became New Interest, Green became Leadsville, Mingo Flats was abbreviated to Mingo, Reynolds became Huttonsville, Scott became Roaring Creek, and Union became Middle Fork.

<text>Raleigh County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 74,591. Its county seat is Beckley. The county was founded in 1850 and is named for Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh County is included in the Beckley, West Virginia, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Raleigh County and the surrounding area have long been home to many indigenous peoples. Early encounters describe the land as being the ancestral home of the Catawba-speaking Moneton people, who referred to the surrounding area as &quot;okahok amai&quot;, and were allies of the Monacan people. The Moneton&#x27;s Catawba speaking neighbors to the south, the Tutelo, (a tribe since absorbed into the Cayuga Nation) may have absorbed surviving Moneton communities, and claim the area as ancestral lands. Conflicts with European settlers resulted in various displaced Indian tribes settling in West Virginia, where they were known at &quot;Mingo&quot;, meaning &quot;remote affiliates of the Iroquois Confederacy&quot;.

Raleigh County was formed on January 23, 1850, from portions of Fayette County, then a part of Virginia. Alfred Beckley (1802–88) said that he named the county for Sir Walter Raleigh (1552–1618), the &quot;enterprising and far-seeing patron of the earliest attempts to colonize our old Mother State of Virginia&quot;.

Raleigh was one of fifty Virginia Counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Raleigh County was initially divided into six townships: Clear Fork, Marsh Fork, Richman, Shady Spring, Town, and Trap Hill. These became magisterial districts in 1872, and the same year a seventh district, Slab Fork, was created from land that had previously belonged to Wyoming County. These remained largely unchanged over the next century, but in the 1970s the seven historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.Heavily involved in the coal mining industry, Raleigh County has been the scene of numerous deadly incidents, of which the most severe was the Eccles Mine Disaster in 1914. At least one hundred and eighty miners died in what was the second-worst coal mining disaster in state history. More recently, the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, which killed twenty-nine miners, occurred in Raleigh County. Raleigh County miners were also killed by violent suppression of labor organizing, such as in the so-called Battle of Stanaford during the 1902-1903 New River coal strike in which an armed posse led by a US Marshall who shot up miners&#x27; houses while they and their families slept, killing at least six. The perpetrators were later acquitted. The lead-up and aftermath were witnessed and widely recounted by &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, and the massacre is considered a prelude to the West Virginia coal wars.

The town of Sophia in Raleigh County was the home of Senator Robert C. Byrd.

<text>George Leslie Goebel (May 20, 1919 – February 24, 1991) was an American humorist, actor, and comedian. He was best known as the star of his own weekly comedy variety television series, &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, on NBC from 1954 to 1959 and on CBS from 1959 to 1960 (alternating in its last season with &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;). He was also a familiar panelist on the NBC game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

==Early years==
He was born George Leslie Goebel in Chicago on May 20, 1919, the only child of Hermann and Lillian (MacDonald) Goebel. His father, Hermann Goebel, who was then working as a butcher and grocer, had immigrated to the United States in the 1890s with his parents from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His mother, Lillian (MacDonald) Goebel, was a native of Illinois, as was her mother, while Lillian&#x27;s father, a tugboat captain, had immigrated from Scotland.

Even before his 1937 graduation from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Chicago, Gobel was a country music singer on the &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; on Chicago&#x27;s WLS radio and later on KMOX in St. Louis. In 1942, Gobel married his high-school sweetheart, Alice Rose Humecki. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served as a flight instructor in AT-9 aircraft at Altus, Oklahoma, and later in B-26 Marauder bombers at Frederick, Oklahoma. In a 1969 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, Gobel joked about his stateside wartime service: &quot;There was not one Japanese aircraft that got past Tulsa.&quot; He resumed his career as an entertainer after the war, although he decided to focus predominantly on comedy rather than just singing.

==Television==
Gobel debuted his comedy series on NBC on October 2, 1954. It showcased his quiet, homespun style of humor, a low-key alternative to what audiences had seen on Milton Berle&#x27;s shows. A huge success, the popular series made the crew-cut Gobel one of the biggest comedy stars of the 1950s. The weekly show featured vocalist Peggy King and actress Jeff Donnell (semi regularly), as well as numerous guest artists, including such stars as James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Kirk Douglas, and Tennessee Ernie Ford. In 1955, Gobel won an Emmy Award for &quot;most outstanding new personality.&quot; On October 24, 1954, Gobel did a 12-minute spot on &quot;Light&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee&quot;, a two-hour TV special broadcast on all four U.S. television networks of the time.

Gobel and his business manager David P. O&#x27;Malley formed a production company, Gomalco, a composite of their last names. In addition to Gobel&#x27;s own series, the company produced the first four years (1957–61) of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, as well as the films &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; (1956) and &quot;I Married a Woman&quot; (1958), both starring Gobel.

The centerpiece of Gobel&#x27;s comedy show was his monologue about his supposed past situations and experiences, with stories and sketches allegedly about his real-life wife, Alice (nicknamed &quot;Spooky Old Alice&quot;), played by actress Jeff Donnell (for the first four years of the series&#x27; run). Gobel&#x27;s hesitant, almost shy delivery and penchant for tangled digressions were the chief sources of comedy, more important than the actual content of the stories. His monologues popularized several catchphrases, notably &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll be a dirty bird&quot; (spoken by the Kathy Bates character in the 1990 film &quot;Misery&quot;), &quot;You can&#x27;t hardly get them like that no more&quot;, and &quot;Well then there now&quot; (spoken by James Dean during a brief imitation of Gobel in the 1955 film &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; and as part of the closing lyric in Perry Como&#x27;s 1956 hit record &quot;Juke Box Baby&quot;). Gobel&#x27;s show used some of television&#x27;s top writers of the era: Hal Kanter, Jack Brooks, and Norman Lear. Peggy King was a regular on the series as a vocalist, and the guest stars ranged from Shirley MacLaine and Evelyn Rudie to Bob Feller, Phyllis Avery, and Vampira.

Gobel labeled himself &quot;Lonesome George,&quot; and the nickname stuck for the rest of his career. The show sometimes included a segment in which Gobel appeared with a guitar, started to sing, then got sidetracked into a story, with the song always left unfinished after fitful starts and stops, a comedy approach (akin to one used by Victor Borge) and the Smothers Brothers. (Tommy Smothers noted that Gobel &quot;was my motivation when I got into comedy originally&quot;, observing that &quot;he didn&#x27;t do jokes—he did timing and played the guitar.&quot;) Gobel had a scaled-down version of the Gibson L-5 archtop guitar constructed to suit his own smaller stature. Several dozen of this &quot;L-5CT&quot; or &quot;George Gobel&quot; model were produced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also played the harmonica.

In 1957, three U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortress bombers made the first nonstop round-the-world flight by turbojet aircraft. One of the bombers was called &quot;Lonesome George&quot;. The crew later appeared on Gobel&#x27;s primetime television show and recounted the 45-hour-and-19-minute mission. Lonesome George, the nonbreeding Galapagos tortoise that was the last of his subspecies and that died in June 2012, was also named after Gobel.

From 1958 to 1961, Gobel appeared in Las Vegas at the El Rancho Vegas and in Reno at the Mapes Hotel. In 1961, Gobel and Sam Levene starred as Erwin and Patsy in &quot;Let It Ride&quot;, an original Broadway musical based on the 1935 original Broadway play &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; (1935) co-authored by George Abbott and John Cecil Holm, which had an initial Broadway run of 835 performances, also starring Sam Levene as Patsy. With a book written by Abram S. Ginnes and a score by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, &quot;Let It Ride&quot; was directed by Stanley Prager, then a successful TV director of the popular sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;. &quot;Let It Ride&quot; opened at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre October 12, 1961, and closed December 9 after 68 performances and one preview. Critics compared the show unfavorably to &quot;How to Succeed in Business ...&quot;. He continued to work club dates and performed in many of the Playboy Club properties.

Gobel was also a skilled guitar player, and as such was issued a specially designed electric guitar in his name commissioned by the Gibson Guitar Company in 1959 - the George Gobel Model. Gibson chose &quot;George Gobel&quot; as a model name, as Gobel was one of the most well-known television personalities at the time with a nationally broadcast show five nights a week. Gibson believed its new model guitar would enjoy greater exposure on national television, as opposed to naming the model after a lesser-known jazz musician, for example. Gobel accompanied himself with this guitar on a number of his comedy routines.

==TV guest appearances==
Gobel was a guest on various TV programs, including: &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;;&quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;; &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;; &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;; &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot;; &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;; &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;; &quot;Wagon Train&quot;; &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;; &quot;The Donny &amp; Marie Show&quot;; and Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and made cameos on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. An episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; in December 1960 was titled &quot;Lonesome George&quot;, in which Gobel played himself. He appeared on &quot;F Troop&quot; as amateur inventor Henry Terkel in the 1966 episode &quot;Go for Broke&quot;.

In an often-replayed segment from a 1969 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, Gobel entered after Bob Hope and Dean Martin, walking onstage with a plastic cup with an unidentified drink. Gobel remarked to Carson about coming on last and having to follow major stars Hope and Martin. He quipped to Carson, &quot;Did you ever get the feeling that the world was a tuxedo and you were a pair of brown shoes?&quot;, to which Carson, Hope, Martin, and the audience came unglued with laughter. After the laughter died down, Carson asked Gobel about his career in World War II as a fighter pilot. Gobel feigned bewilderment at why people laugh when he says that he spent the war in Oklahoma, pointing out with mock pride that no Japanese plane ever got past Tulsa, deep in the center of the continental U.S. Gobel also began to get some unexpected laughs, being unaware that Dean Martin had begun flicking his cigarette ashes into Gobel&#x27;s drink. Observing all of this, Carson finally asked rhetorically, &quot;Exactly what time did I lose control of the show?!&quot;

Gobel had employed the tuxedo joke at least once before, on the June 22, 1957, episode of his show. He complained that the TV director and crew treated him &quot;as if they were a tuxedo and I was a pair of brown shoes.&quot; On that occasion, the gag received a respectable, but not overwhelming, response.

In 1972, the television game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, hosted by Peter Marshall, needed a substitute for its resident folksy comedian Cliff Arquette (Charley Weaver), who had a stroke. Gobel was recruited, and he sat in Arquette&#x27;s square during Arquette&#x27;s convalescence. After Arquette died in 1974, Gobel became a resident panelist. He was also the voice of Father Mouse in the 1974 Christmas special &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;, and sang the song &quot;Give Your Heart a Try&quot; in that production. He also made a guest appearance on &quot;Hee Haw&quot; in 1976. In the early 1980s, Gobel played Otis Harper Jr., the mayor of Harper Valley in the television series based on the film &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, and guest-starred as himself on an episode of &quot;Madame&#x27;s Place&quot;.

==Films==
When ratings soared on &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot; (rated in the top 10 of 1954–55), Paramount Pictures promoted Gobel as its new comedy star, casting him as the lead in &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; (1956), a remake of &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941) featuring David Niven playing a third-billed supporting role under Gobel and leading lady Mitzi Gaynor. In 1956, Paramount was preparing a biography of veteran comedian Buster Keaton, and Keaton wanted Gobel to portray him. When musical-comedy star Donald O&#x27;Connor became available, Paramount signed him for the film, titled &quot;The Buster Keaton Story&quot; (1957).

Gobel&#x27;s television success did not translate to the big screen, though. His &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; performed so poorly at the box office that release was delayed on his second movie, &quot;I Married a Woman&quot;, filmed in 1956 by RKO Radio Pictures, but not released until 1958. Although scripted by Goodman Ace, it also resulted in disappointing ticket sales, and Gobel&#x27;s career as a movie star came to an abrupt end. He settled into a succession of TV guest-star appearances and did not return to movie screens until two decades later, as a character actor in Joan Rivers&#x27; &quot;Rabbit Test&quot; (1978), followed by &quot;The Day It Came to Earth&quot; (1979) and &quot;Ellie&quot; (1984). He appeared in nine TV movies during the 1970s and 1980s.

Gobel was considered for the voice of Winnie-the-Pooh by Walt Disney, but turned it down after reading the books and finding Pooh to be &quot;an awful bore.&quot;

==Death==
George Gobel died on February 24, 1991, about a month after surgery that was intended to improve his mobility after a series of strokes left him unable to walk. His remains are in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="91016" wikidata="Q1268753" url="?curid=91016" title="Dylan ail Don">
<text>Dylan ail Don () (in Middle Welsh) is a character in the Welsh mythic Mabinogion tales, particularly in the fourth tale, &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot;. The story of Dylan reflects ancient Celtic myths that were handed down orally for some generations before being written down during the early Christian period by clerics. The story as it has been preserved therefore exhibits elements and archetypes characteristic of both Celtic pagan and Christian mythologies. His name translates as &quot;Dylan the Second Wave.&quot;

In some interpretations of legend, Dylan represents darkness while his twin brother Lleu Llaw Gyffes represents light. But the more common interpretation is that Dylan is a Welsh sea-god. Dylan was killed by his uncle, and it has been said that &quot;The clamour of the waves dashing upon the beach is the expression of their longing to avenge their son.&quot;

In Wales, Dylan is one of the most popular traditional Welsh names for boys.

==Biography==
In &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot; it is told that Dylan&#x27;s great uncle Math would die if he did not keep his feet in the lap of a virgin when not at war. Math&#x27;s original foot-holder, Goewin, is raped by Gilfaethwy who is punished severely when Math returns, turning Gilfaethwy and Gwydion into a series of mated pairs of animals. Math then marries Goewin to alleviate her shame, but must find a new virgin to hold his feet. Gwydion suggests his sister, Arianrhod. Math magically tests Arianrhod to confirm that she is a virgin, at which point she gives birth to twin sons.

===Dylan&#x27;s baptism===
One of the sons, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, is borne away by Gwydion as a &quot;lump of flesh&quot; and concealed in a chest until maturity, but the other, a sturdy blonde boy, was immediately forsaken by his mother yet was acknowledged by his great uncle Math and given the name Dylan. As soon as Dylan comes in contact with his baptismal waters, he plunges into the sea and takes on characteristics of a sea creature, moving through the seawater as perfectly as any fish:

&#x27;So they had the boy baptised, and as they baptised him he plunged into the sea. And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its nature, and swam as well as the best fish that was therein. And for that reason was he called Dylan, the son of the Wave&#x27;
===Dylan&#x27;s death===
Dylan is accidentally killed by his uncle Gofannon in the end.

&#x27;And the blow whereby he came to his death, was struck by his uncle Gofannon. The third fatal blow was it called&#x27;.
==Mythological elements==
In literature on Celtic mythology, the character Dylan is sometimes taken to be the vestige of an ancient Celtic God. According to this line of thinking, representation of Dylan in Welsh literature and in folklore alludes to the attributes of his supposed divine ancient Celtic prototype. Squire (2000:158) prefers to see in Dylan the remnants of a god of darkness:

&quot;[T]wo sons were born at one birth – Dylan and Lleu, who are considered as representing the twin powers of darkness and light. The clamour of the waves dashing upon the beach is the expression of their longing to avenge their son. The sound of the sea rushing up the mouth of the River Conwy is still known as &quot;Dylan&#x27;s death-groan&quot;. A small promontory on the Carnarvonshire side of the Menai Strait, called Pwynt Maen Tylen, or Pwynt Maen Dulan, preserves his name.&quot;
Dylan&#x27;s rock is located north of the Church of St Beuno&#x27;s Church at Clynnog Fawr on the seashore, which must be on or near the location of his grave as told in Englynion y Beddau (Stanzas of the Grave) of the Black Book of Carmarthen xxxii: 

On the other hand, MacCulloch (1911, Ch. VI) has preferred to see Dylan simply as the remnants of a local sea-god of Gwynedd:
‘Dylan, however, has no dark traits and is described as a blonde. The waves lament his death, and, as they dash against the shore, seek to avenge it. His grave is &quot;where the wave makes a sullen sound,&quot; but popular belief identifies him with the waves, and their noise as they press into the Conwy is his dying groan. Not only is he Eil Ton, &quot;son of the wave,&quot; but also Eil Mor, &quot;son of the sea.&quot; He is thus a local sea-god, and like Manannan identified with the waves, and yet separate from them, since they mourn his death. The Mabinogi gives us the débris of myths explaining how an anthropomorphic sea-god was connected with the goddess Arianrhod and slain by a god Govannon.’
==Genealogy==
In the Mabinogion, Dylan&#x27;s mother, Arianrhod, is the daughter of Dôn and the sister of Gwydion and Gilfaethwy. Her Uncle, Math ap Mathonwy, is the King of Gwynedd, and during the course of the story, Arianrhod gives birth to her two sons; Dylan ail Don and Lleu Llaw Gyffes through magical means.

In the Welsh Triads, we are given a context for an actual Arianrhod who appears as the daughter of Beli Mawr and the sister of Caswallawn (the historical Cassivellaunus). Whether this reference is the result of the merging of a myth and history is unclear. It is possible that a later historic Arianrhod has become identified and merged with an earlier legendary/mythological Arianrhod.

==Literary reference==
Dylan is the subject of a eulogy entitled Marwnad Dylan Ail Don attributed to the bard Taliesin:

One God Supreme, divine, the wisest, the greatest his habitation,
when he came to the field, who charmed him in the hand of the extremely liberal.
Or sooner than he, who was on peace on the nature of a turn.
An opposing groom, poison made, a wrathful deed,
Piercing Dylan a mischievous shore, violence freely flowing
Wave of Iwerdon, and wave of Manau, and wave of the North,
And wave of Prydain, hosts comely in fours.
I will adore the Father God, the regulator of the country, without refusing.
Creator in Heaven, may he admit us into merry.
==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Dylan&quot; is somewhat complex. In Welsh, there is a bound item &quot;dylanw&quot;- which appears in &quot;dylanwad&quot; ‘influence,’ &quot;dylanwadol&quot; ‘influential’ and &quot;dylanwadu&quot; ‘to influence’. This element &quot;dylanw&quot;- appears itself to be a compound of the prefix &quot;dy&quot;- and the noun &quot;llanw&quot; ‘tidal flow’. The prefix &quot;dy&quot;- appears in numerous words in Welsh and is reconstructed in Proto-Celtic as *&quot;dī&quot;- with the meaning of ‘off, away’. The item &quot;llanw&quot; is reconstructed in Proto-Celtic as *&quot;φlanwo&quot;- ‘flood, filling.’ This *&quot;φlanwo&quot;- may plausibly have had a reduced form *&quot;φlanu&quot;- ‘flood.’ This etymology is echoed in the following Gaelic (Irish) words:

*[&quot;tuinne&quot;] nf. in : gob na tuinne, the water edge
*[&quot;tòn&quot;] nf. g. tòine; d. tòin; pl.+an, the fundament
*[&quot;tonn&quot;] nm. g.v. tuinn; pl.+an and tuinn, wave, surge, billow

<doc id="91017" wikidata="Q1856420" url="?curid=91017" title="Santa Claus, Indiana">
<text>Santa Claus is a town in Spencer County, Indiana, United States, in the southwestern part of the state. The population was 2,586 at the 2020 census. It is home to numerous Christmas themed attractions, including Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari and Santa&#x27;s Candy Castle.

The town was established in 1854 and known as Santa Fe (), but was unable to establish a post office as there was already another Santa Fe, Indiana. Several town meetings were held, during which the name &quot;Santa Claus&quot; was selected. The town has the world&#x27;s only post office to bear the name of the eponymous Christmas figure. Because of this popular name, the post office receives thousands of letters to Santa from all over the world each year. A group of volunteers known as Santa&#x27;s Elves ensures each child receives a reply from Santa Claus; this tradition has been in existence since at least 1914. The post office also creates an annual Christmas hand-cancellation pictorial postmark for use during December, which also attracts mail from all over the world.

Santa Claus has grown substantially since the 1990 census, which recorded 927 residents. A majority of Santa Claus residents live within the gated community of Christmas Lake Village, which was developed in the late 1960s. It consists of developed around three lakes: Christmas Lake, Lake Holly, and Lake Noel. The street names in Christmas Lake Village are all named after the Christmas season. Many residents also live in Holiday Village, a subdivision on the north side of town.

==History==

The community of Santa Claus was established in 1849. The story of how it received the name of Santa Claus has roots both in fact and legend. In January 1856, the town applied for a post office to be installed. They submitted their application under the name of Santa Fe. The application was returned to them with the message, &quot;Choose some name other than Santa Fe.&quot; The process of settling upon the name of Santa Claus has been lost to legend. There are many different versions of the story and there were other choices as well that the town did not settle upon. What is known is that in 1856, the name of Santa Claus was accepted by the Post Office Department.

On June 25, 1895, as part of a nationwide standardization for place names (see United States Board of Geographic Names), the post office name was changed to the one word &quot;Santaclaus&quot;. The town&#x27;s unique name went largely unnoticed until the late 1920s, when Postmaster James Martin began promoting the Santa Claus postmark. The name was changed back to &quot;Santa Claus&quot; on February 17, 1928. It was then that the Post Office Department decided there would never be another Santa Claus Post Office in the United States, due to the influx of holiday mail and the staffing and logistical problems this caused. The growing volume of holiday mail became so substantial that it caught the attention of Robert Ripley in 1929, who featured the town&#x27;s post office in his nationally syndicated &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; cartoon strip.

The town&#x27;s name also inspired Vincennes, Indiana entrepreneur Milt Harris to create Santa&#x27;s Candy Castle, the first tourist attraction in Santa Claus, Indiana. Dedicated December 22, 1935 and sponsored by the Curtiss Candy Company, the red-brick Candy Castle is purported to be the first themed attraction in the United States. Another Santa Claus Town attraction, Toy Village, features a series of miniature fairytale buildings sponsored by prominent national toy manufacturers. Santa Claus Town led to the creation of the town&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Santa Claus Town News&quot;, and the Santa Claus Chamber of Commerce.

Harris&#x27; project caught the attention of a rival entrepreneur, Carl Barrett, the Chicago head of the Illinois Auto Club. Disliking what he called Harris&#x27; materialism, Barrett planned his own tourist attraction, Santa Claus Park. On December 25, 1935, Barrett dedicated a tall statue of Santa Claus that was erected on the highest hill in town. The statue was promoted as being solid granite, although it was subsequently revealed to be concrete when cracks formed years later.
Years of lawsuits between Harris and Barrett were costly distractions for the two entrepreneurs. The lawsuits centered around land ownership and went all the way to the Indiana Supreme Court. National news media covered the ongoing story of &quot;Too Many Santas.&quot; Over the years, both entrepreneurs&#x27; visions became neglected as the development of the town spread west due to land development by the Koch Family.

On August 3, 1946, retired industrialist Louis J. Koch opened Santa Claus Land, which is claimed to be the world&#x27;s first theme park. The park&#x27;s name was changed to Holiday World in 1984. In 1993, it became Holiday World &amp; Splashin&#x27; Safari when a water park named Splashin&#x27; Safari was added to the park. Still owned and operated by the Koch family, it attracts more than one million visitors annually, and it is home to The Voyage, which has repeatedly been voted by coaster enthusiasts as the number one wooden roller coaster in the world.

More recently the development of Christmas Lake Village as a gated community has more than doubled the population of Santa Claus. In 2005, a local development company purchased Santa&#x27;s Candy Castle and other buildings that comprised Santa Claus Town and announced plans to restore and re-open them to the public, starting with Santa&#x27;s Candy Castle on July 1, 2006. The 40-ton, 22-foot concrete Santa Claus statue was restored in 2011. And in 2012, a local historic church and the town&#x27;s original post office were moved to the site next to the large Santa Claus statue.

<text>Preston County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 34,216. Its county seat is Kingwood. The county was formed from Monongalia County in 1818 and named for Virginia Governor James Patton Preston.

Preston County is part of the Morgantown, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is the southernmost county of the Pittsburgh media market. It is the home of The Buckwheat Festival, a county fair known for making buckwheat pancakes.

==History==
Native Americans lived in (and traveled through) what would one day become Preston County; they crossed-over from the Ohio River watershed, which drains into the Mississippi River, into the Chesapeake Bay watershed. From 1736, European traders and explorers lived in the County, and one boundary stone was laid in 1746—the Fairfax Stone marking the limits of the North Branch of the River. Larger numbers of white settlers began arriving in 1766, with even more coming to the region after the American Revolutionary War. Traveling by foot or horseback, settlers built their own log cabins. Further development followed from 1818, when the National Road was built slightly to the north. When the earliest railroads came, in 1851, all land passed into private ownership, the population increased 70% in a decade, and industrialization truly began.

During the American Civil War, more Preston County men enlisted in Union service than with the Confederacy. There were relatively few slave owners in Preston County, and naturally, few slaves. There were virtually none within a half-hour’s walk from the old Clarksburg-Winchester Road, dated to the late colonial era. The United States Census indicates that Preston County’s all-time slavery peak occurred in 1830, with 125 slaves accounted for, alongside 27 free colored persons.

On June 20, 1863, Preston was one of 50 Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the State of West Virginia. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state of West Virginia, and the townships were converted into magisterial districts in 1872. Preston County was divided into eight districts: Grant, Kingwood, Lyon, Pleasant, Portland, Reno, Union, and Valley. These remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when they were consolidated into five new magisterial districts: First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

In West Virginia&#x27;s coldest month of January 1977, Terra Alta in Preston County saw a statewide record snowfall of .

==Politics and government==
===Federal politics===
Preston County lies within West Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. The current representative of the district is Alex Mooney (R).

Generally speaking, most of the State of West Virginia has become a Republican bastion in the 21st century, after having leaned heavily Democratic between the New Deal and Bill Clinton). However, Preston County has seemingly always been a Republican stronghold, if not quite as ‘rock-ribbed’ as its neighbor, Grant County, or nearby Garrett County, Maryland, two counties that have historically &quot;never&quot; voted for a Democrat in the post-Civil War years. Preston County has, by comparison, voted Democratic on at least one occasion, during Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide election; however, Johnson&#x27;s win over Barry Goldwater was much more decisive than his narrow victory in analogous Upshur County, and Bill Clinton came within 20 votes in 1996.












===State politics===
Preston County is represented by two Senators in the West Virginia Senate. Senate members Jay Taylor (R), and Randy Smith (R) both serve in West Virginia&#x27;s 14th Senate district. The county is also represented in the West Virginia House of Delegates by two Delegates. The Delegates for Preston County are George Street (R) for district 83 and D. Rolland Jennings (R) for district 84.

===County government===
Preston County is governed by a County Commission. The commission is made up of the Commission President and Commissioners whom wield administrative powers of the county&#x27;s government. Samantha Stone (R) is the current President of the County Commission.

The Preston County Commission consists of two members. The current members of the County Commission are Don Smith (R) and Hunter Thomas (R).

<text>Pocahontas County is a county located in the eastern part of the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,869. Its county seat is Marlinton. The county was established in 1821. It is named after the daughter of the Powhatan chief of the Native Americans in the United States who came from Jamestown, Virginia. She married an English settler, and their children became ancestors of many of the First Families of Virginia.

Pocahontas County is the home to the Green Bank Observatory and is part of the National Radio Quiet Zone.

==History==
When Andrew Lewis, early American pioneer, surveyor, and soldier from Virginia, came to survey one of the land grants for the Greenbrier Company in 1751, he found Jacob Marlin and Stephen Sewell living where Marlinton later developed. They had come from Frederick, Maryland, in 1749 and are considered to be the first European settlers in this region of Virginia. They built their original cabin where Marlin Run met Knapp&#x27;s Creek. Lewis had found Sewell living in a large hollow sycamore tree near the cabin. This area is now between Eighth and Ninth avenues and Eighth and Ninth streets of Marlinton.

This area was reserved by the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy as a hunting ground, by right of their conquest of tribes that had been in the area. These American Indians resisted European settlement in the lands they had taken. A treaty of 1758 by Great Britain confirmed the land west of the Allegheny Mountains to the Indians and forbade his Majesty&#x27;s subjects from settling or hunting here.

But the British settlers continued to move into the Indian hunting grounds, making them a target for many raids and massacres. After the Revolution, the Indians migrated west, and the settlers&#x27; land claims were made regular.

During the Civil War Pocahontas County voted to secede from the United States by a vote of 360 to 13 and supported the state government in Richmond. The county contained 907 men of military age (15–50 years old) and provided nearly 700 men to the Confederate army and levied $15,000 for armaments. Farming and harvesting crops soon became difficult due to enlistments, and many of the county&#x27;s 252 slaves fled during Union troop movements through the county. Some Unionist refugees who had fled to Upshur County enlisted in the 10th West Virginia Infantry Regiment. The battles of Cheat Mountain and Camp Allegheny took place in the county in 1861, and in 1863 the battle of Droop Mountain occurred, resulting in a Union victory.

A government loyal to the United States was established in Wheeling called the Restored Government of Virginia. Under its guidance a bill was introduced to the United States Congress to create a new state from 48 counties of western Virginia to be called West Virginia. While many of these counties were generally loyal to the U.S., many were not but were taken for territorial reasons. The new state was officially recognized on June 20, 1863.

Pocahontas County was added to the new state of West Virginia without the input of the citizens. The new state government in Wheeling reorganized the county militia as a Unionist force. After the war most of the voters in the county were disfranchised due to their support of Richmond and the Confederacy, and full voting rights were not restored until 1871.

The new state government divided the counties into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Pocahontas County was initially divided into four townships, each of which was given a patriotic name: Grant, Lincoln, Meade, and Union. They became magisterial districts in 1872, and all four were renamed the following year: Grant District, originally named for Union General Ulysses S. Grant, became Huntersville District; Lincoln, named after the President, became Edray; Meade, named for General George Meade, became Greenbank, and Union District became Academy. In the 1890s, Academy District was renamed again, becoming Little Levels.

The railroads came late to Pocahontas County, as building rails over the mountains was a difficult and expensive project. It was not until 1899 that construction began but after that, the task moved with startling speed. The 1900 census of the county indicates that many European immigrants came to the region as workers on building the railroads through this area.

Commercial timbering quickly began upon completion of the railroads, including a large mill owned by the West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Company (now MeadWestvaco) at Cass. By the end of 1920, dozens of small railroading towns dotted the landscape along the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway line.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. It is the third-largest county in West Virginia by area, and with a mean altitude of it is the sixth-highest county east of the Mississippi River and the highest county in this region outside Western North Carolina.

The highest point is Thorny Flat on Cheat Mountain in the northwestern part of the county, elevation .

===Birthplace of rivers===
The county is the site of the headwaters for eight rivers: Cherry River, Cranberry River, Elk River, Gauley River, Greenbrier River, Tygart Valley River, Williams River, and Shavers Fork of the Cheat River. The Monongahela National Forest protects much of the river headwaters, thereby helping to ensure improved downstream water quality.

<text>Pleasants County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. At the 2020 census, the population was 7,653. Its county seat is St. Marys.

==History==
Pleasants County was formed by the Virginia General Assembly from portions of adjacent Wood, Ritchie and Tyler counties on March 29, 1851. The county&#x27;s namesake is James Pleasants, Jr., an esteemed former US Senator and Virginia Governor. On June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, Pleasants County was one of fifty Virginia counties that entered the Union as the state of West Virginia.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Pleasants County was divided into six districts: Grant, Jefferson, Lafayette, McKim, Union, and Washington. These remained largely unchanged for over a century, but in the 1980s the six historic magisterial districts were consolidated into four new districts: District A, District B, District C, and District D.

==Politics==
Although Pleasants County, like neighbouring rock-ribbed Unionist and Republican Ritchie, Doddridge and Tyler Counties, voted against secession at the Virginia Secession Convention, during the Third Party System the county voted consistently Democratic. However, from 1900 onwards the county has generally voted Republican except in strong Democratic election victories, and like all of West Virginia it has become rock-ribbed GOP in the twenty-first century as a consequence of de-unionization in the coal industry.

<text>Pendleton County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,143, making it the second-least populous county in West Virginia. Its county seat is Franklin. The county was created by the Virginia General Assembly in 1788 from parts of Augusta, Hardy, and Rockingham counties and was named for Edmund Pendleton (1721–1803), a distinguished Virginia statesman and jurist.

Spruce Knob, located in Pendleton County, is the highest point in the state and in the Alleghenies, its elevation being 4,863 feet. Parts of the Monongahela and George Washington National Forests are also located in Pendleton County.

==History==
By the 1740s, the three main valleys of what became Pendleton County had been visited and named by white hunters and prospectors. One of the hunters, a single man named Abraham Burner, built himself a log cabin about a half mile downstream of the future site of Brandywine in 1745. He was the county&#x27;s first white settler. A local historian recorded that: The site ... [was] on the left bank of the river, and near the beginning of a long, eastward bend. From almost at his very door his huntsman&#x27;s eye was at times gladdened by seeing perhaps fifty deer either drinking from the steam or plunging in their heads up to their ears in search of moss. By 1747, immigrants were impinging on the (future) borders of Pendleton from two directions: the larger community was mostly Germans moving up the valley of the South Branch Potomac; the lesser consisted mainly of Scotch-Irish moving northwest from Staunton up into the headwaters of the James River. In an April 1758, surprise raid of Fort Seybert and nearby Fort Upper Tract occasioned by the French and Indian War (1754–63), most of the 60 white settlers sheltering there were massacred by Shawnee and Delaware warriors and the forts were burned.

Pendleton County was created by the Virginia General Assembly in 1788 from parts of Augusta, Hardy, and Rockingham counties and was named for Edmund Pendleton, a distinguished Virginia statesman and jurist. Pendleton County was split between Northern and Southern sympathies during the American Civil War. The northern section of the county, including the enclave in the Smoke Hole community was staunchly Unionist. In June 1863, the county was included by the federal government in the new state of West Virginia against the wishes of many of the inhabitants. That fall, Union General W.W. Averell swept up the South Branch valley, and destroyed the Confederate saltpetre works above Franklin.

In the months following the state&#x27;s establishment, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Pendleton County was divided into six districts: Bethel, Circleville, Franklin, Mill Run, Sugar Grove, and Union. Except for minor adjustments, these magisterial districts remained largely unchanged until the 1990s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: Central, Eastern, and Western.

Pendleton County and the surrounding area were hit by severe flooding in November 1985. At Franklin, the county seat, the South Branch of the Potomac crested at 22.6 feet, more than fifteen feet above flood stage in the shallow riverbed. Sixty-two people were killed in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, in what became known as the &quot;1985 Election Day floods&quot; in Virginia, or the &quot;Killer Floods of 1985&quot; in West Virginia. According to the National Weather Service, thirty-eight of the deaths occurred in Pendleton and Grant Counties, West Virginia. Twenty-two people were killed in Virginia, and there was one fatality each attributed to the flooding in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

==Geography==

==Economy==
Pendleton County&#x27;s economy consists mainly of small to medium-sized farms and small businesses. Most of these are in Franklin, the county&#x27;s only incorporated town. The North Fork Valley, on the western side of the county, has a number of businesses that cater to tourists who come for the area&#x27;s outdoor recreation opportunities. These include motels, restaurants, and guide services. In recent years, maple syrup has emerged as a major growth industry in the county. Dry Fork Maple Works, the state&#x27;s largest maple sugaring operation, is based in Pendleton County (though its sugaring operation occurs mainly in neighboring Randolph County).

The county is also home to a number of non-profits whose reaches extend well beyond the county lines. These include Almost Heaven Habitat for Humanity, Future Generations and Future Generations Graduate School, The Mountain Institute, and Mountain Springs Farm and Heritage Center.

Sugar Grove Station, an electronic listening post for the National Security Agency, is located near the southeast corner of the Pendleton County.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Nicholas County was divided into six districts: Grant, Jefferson, Kentucky, Mumble-the-peg, Summersville, and Wilderness. In 1873, Mumble-the-peg became Hamilton District. A seventh district, Beaver, was created in the 1880s.

<text>Morgan County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 17,063. Its county seat is Berkeley Springs. The county was formed in 1820 from parts of Hampshire and Berkeley Counties and named in honor of General Daniel Morgan, prominent soldier of the American Revolutionary War. The county and town of Bath are considered excellent jumping-off points for exploring the Potomac and Cacapon Rivers just to the north and west, respectively. Also, the county is a tourist destination hosting numerous local artists, mineral water spas, and a large amount of outdoor recreation that includes fishing, boating, wildlife, hunting, and mountain scenery. The region is known for the famed Apple Butter Festival held annually in October. Morgan County is also the home of an important silica mine, part of U.S. Silica.

==History==
Morgan County was created by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1820 from parts of Berkeley and Hampshire counties. It was named in honor of General Daniel Morgan (1736–1802). He was born in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, and moved to Winchester, Virginia as a youth. He served as a wagoner in Braddock&#x27;s Army during the campaign against the Native Americans in 1755. During the campaign, a British Lieutenant became angry with him and hit him with the flat of his sword. Morgan punched the Lieutenant, knocking him unconscious. Morgan was court-martialed for striking a British officer and was sentenced to 500 lashes. Morgan later joked that the drummer who counted out the lashes miscounted and he received only 499 lashes. For the rest of his life, he claimed the British still owed him one.

===Early European settlers===
The first English settlers in present-day Morgan County arrived during the 1730s. Because most of these early pioneers were squatters, there is no record of their names. Historians claim that the first cabin in the county was built around 1745. As word of the county&#x27;s warm springs spread eastward, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron decided that the county needed to be surveyed. In 1748, George Washington, then just 16 years old, was part of the survey party that surveyed the Eastern Panhandle region for Lord Fairfax. He later returned to Bath (Berkeley Springs) several times over the next several years with his half-brother, Lawrence, who was ill and hoped that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous Native Americans as well as Europeans to the area.

===18th century===
As mentioned previously, George Washington visited present-day Berkeley Springs several times with his half-brother, Lawrence. When he vacationed in the area in 1767, he noted how busy the town had become. Lord Fairfax had built a summer home there and a &quot;private bath&quot; making the area a popular destination for Virginia&#x27;s social elite. As the town continued to grow, the Virginia General Assembly decided to formally recognize it. In October 1776, the town was officially named Bath, in honor of England&#x27;s spa city called Bath. The town&#x27;s main north–south street was named Washington and the main east–west street was named Fairfax. Also, were set aside for &quot;suffering humanity.&quot; When West Virginia gained statehood, that area became West Virginia&#x27;s first state park.

Bath&#x27;s population increased during and immediately after the American Revolutionary War as wounded soldiers and others came to the area believing that the warm springs had medicinal qualities. Bath gained a reputation as a somewhat wild town where eating, drinking, dancing, and gambling on the daily horse races were the order of the day.

Bath later became known as Berkeley Springs, primarily because the town&#x27;s post office took that name (combining Governor Norborne Berkeley&#x27;s last name with the warm springs found there) to avoid confusion with another post office, located in southeastern Virginia, which was already called Bath. Because the mail was sent to and from Berkeley Springs, that name slowly took precedence.

===19th century===
Morgan County was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Morgan County was divided into six districts: Allen, Bath, Cacapon, Rock Gap, Sleepy Creek, and Timber Ridge. Except for minor adjustments, the historic magisterial districts remained unchanged until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3. A District 4 was created in the 1990s, but subsequently discontinued.

===20th century===
On April 10, 1919, racial violence broke out when the Morgan County race riot was sparked by local business using African-American strikebreakers against local striking white workers. On the same day of the riots one Hugh Ferguson, a Martinsburg African-American, was accused of criminally assaulting Mrs. Ernest Zimmerman at her home near Brosius, Morgan County (now known as Hancock, West Virginia). An angry mob of several hundred men formed around the jail hoping to lynch Ferguson. Sheriff C. R. Hovermale was forced to flee town with Ferguson.

==Politics==
Morgan County has historically been a stronghold for the Republican Party. Every Republican presidential nominee has won Morgan County since 1864, the first presidential election following West Virginia&#x27;s statehood. The last Democratic presidential nominee to win Morgan County was Lewis Cass in 1848; the county was won by the Whig Party, the Know-Nothing Party and John Bell&#x27;s Constitutional Union Party in its last three elections as part of Virginia.

The county is a massive outlier in West Virginia, a state that tilted Democratic for much of the 20th century before swinging hard to the GOP. Franklin Roosevelt did no better than 39 percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and only two Democrats—Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter—have managed even 40 percent of the vote. The 1964 United States presidential election was by far the closest election here, with Barry Goldwater taking the county by a margin of just 46 votes.

<text>Monroe County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,376. Its county seat is Union. Monroe County was the home of Andrew Summers Rowan of Spanish–American War fame, who is immortalized in Elbert Hubbard&#x27;s classic &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot;. The county was also the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat (6.896 g) Jones Diamond by Grover C. Jones and William &quot;Punch&quot; Jones. Monroe County celebrates its own holiday, Farmers&#x27; Day.

==History==
Monroe County was created from Greenbrier County on January 14, 1799, and was named for Virginia civic figure James Monroe, who would be elected fifth President of the United States in November 1816. It was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. Monroe County did not participate in the creation of the new state, but was included by Congressional decree. Almost all the men from Monroe who served in the Civil War enlisted in the Confederate army.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Monroe County was initially divided into seven townships: Forest Hill, Red Sulphur, Second Creek, Springfield, Sweet Springs, Union, and Wolf Creek. In 1871, part of Forest Hill Township was added to the new county of Summers, and the remaining territory distributed between Red Sulphur and Springfield Townships. The following year, the six remaining townships became magisterial districts. Except for minor adjustments, the six historic magisterial districts were unchanged until the 1990s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: Central, Eastern, and Western.

==Geography==
Monroe County lies on the southeast side of West Virginia. Its southeast border abuts the northwest border of the state of Virginia. The New River flows northward for a short distance along the county&#x27;s southwest border. The county&#x27;s terrain is mountainous and tree-covered, with all sufficiently level surfaces devoted to agriculture. The terrain slopes to the north and west, with its highest part the middle part of its border with Virginia, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

==Politics==
Monroe County was strongly pro-Confederate during the Virginia Secession Convention. It voted Democratic consistently up until voting for William McKinley in 1900, but since then has leaned Republican except during Democratic landslides, and like all of West Virginia has become overwhelmingly Republican in the twenty-first century due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s views on social issues.










==Government and infrastructure==

===FPC Alderson===
The Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; Federal Prison Camp, Alderson was the nation&#x27;s first women&#x27;s federal prison. It is located in Monroe and Summers counties, west of Alderson.
==Natural landmarks==
One of Monroe County&#x27;s geological features is Haynes Cave, a former saltpeter mine. Workers in the mine found strange bones in the cave at the end of the 18th Century, and mailed them to Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson&#x27;s study of the animal, the Megalonyx jeffersonii was arguably the birth of American paleontology. It is now the official West Virginia state fossil.

However, other saltpeter caves are in private ownership, and allow only limited public access due to ecological risks. One such is the Greenville Saltpeter Cave, designated a national natural landmark in 1973, and very important during the War of 1812.

<text>Monongalia County, known locally as Mon County, is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 105,822, making it West Virginia&#x27;s third-most populous county. Its county seat is Morgantown. The county was founded in 1776. Monongalia County is included in the Morgantown, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is the largest county in North-Central West Virginia. It is part of the Pittsburgh media market.

==History==
Monongalia County takes its name from the Monongahela River. The name &quot;Monongalia&quot; may be a misspelling of Monongahela. Alternatively, the conventional Latinate ending &quot;-ia&quot; (designating &quot;land of...&quot; or &quot;country of...&quot; — as in &quot;Arabia&quot;, &quot;Bolivia&quot; or &quot;Colombia&quot;) may have been added to Monongahela (i.e., &quot;Land of the Monongahela&quot;).

Monongalia County was formed in 1776 when Virginia&#x27;s remote District of West Augusta was divided into three counties: Ohio, Yohogania and Monongalia, all named for their most prominent rivers. Ohio County then encompassed most of the western region of the district bordering the Ohio River, including parts of what is now southwestern Pennsylvania. Yohogania County consisted of much of what is now southwestern Pennsylvania and the present counties of Hancock and the northern part of Brooke in West Virginia. Monongalia County also encompassed what are now the counties of Tucker, Randolph, Marion, Harrison and Barbour in north-central West Virginia, as well as parts of what are now Washington, Greene and Fayette Counties in Pennsylvania. In 1780, in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, Thomas Jefferson gave the militia enrollment of what was then the vast Monongalia County at 1,000 troops.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Monongalia County was divided into seven districts: Battelle, Cass, Clay, Clinton, Grant, Morgan, and Union. After a century of relative stability, in the 1970s Monongalia&#x27;s seven historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new Districts: Central, Eastern, and Western.

==Government and politics==
The county government consists of a county commission with three members. Currently, these members are: Thomas Bloom (D), Sean Sikora (R) and Jeffery Arnett (D). While still typically favoring Republicans, the county tends to lean significantly more Democratic than the rest of West Virginia.

In the 20th century, Monongalia County had been a bellwether for West Virginia, voting the same as the state in every election from 1916 to 2024, even as the candidate lost the national election, with the sole exception of 2008 when Barack Obama won the county and lost the state. Donald Trump carried the county with just over 500 more votes than Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, by far Biden&#x27;s best county-level performance in the state.

Its competitiveness is due to its seat, Morgantown, home of the West Virginia University, being solidly Democratic and the county&#x27;s rural precincts being solidly Republican. The rural precincts are slightly more populous, resulting in the county&#x27;s Republican tilt.











==Education==
The county&#x27;s public schools are operated by Monongalia County Schools. The county is also home to West Virginia&#x27;s largest university, West Virginia University, located in Morgantown.

<doc id="91027" wikidata="Q494598" url="?curid=91027" title="Mingo County, West Virginia">
<text>Mingo County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,568. Its county seat and largest city is Williamson. Created in 1895, Mingo is West Virginia&#x27;s newest county, named for the historic Iroquoian Mingo people.

==History==
Mingo County is West Virginia&#x27;s newest county, formed by an act of the state legislature in 1895 from parts of Logan County. The county was named for the Mingo Native Americans.

At the time of its creation, Mingo County was divided into magisterial districts, which the United States Census Bureau classifies as a type of non-functional subdivision serving purely administrative purposes. After West Virginia&#x27;s establishment in 1863, its counties were initially divided into civil townships, with the intent to encourage local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts.

Mingo County&#x27;s five original districts were Hardee, Harvey, Lee, Magnolia, and Stafford. As West Virginia&#x27;s only county established after 1871, Mingo is unique in never having been divided into townships, but Hardee, Lee, and Magnolia districts were formerly districts in Logan County, and Hardee and Magnolia were townships until 1872.

A sixth district, Warfield, was created from part of Harvey District in 1906, followed by the formation of Williamson District from part of Lee in 1908; Williamson District was coextensive with the City of Williamson. In the 1920s, Warfield District was renamed Kermit, after its chief town. An eighth district, Tug River, was formed from part of Lee District in 1947. Mingo County was redistricted in 2005, at which time Hardee and Tug River Districts were consolidated to form Tug Hardee, and Harvey and Kermit were consolidated to form Kermit Harvey.

The attempt to unionize coal miners in the county in the 1920s led to the Battle of Blair Mountain in neighboring Logan County.

Politically, Mingo County strongly opposed former President Barack Obama. In 2008, Obama received only 8% of the vote in the Democratic primary, one of his worst performances nationwide. In 2012, Keith Russell Judd, a convicted felon who was the only other candidate on the ballot, received more Mingo County primary votes than Obama.

In 2014 Mingo County native Jeremy T. K. Farley published &quot;The Ghosts of Mingo County&quot;, based on the real-life story of Timmy Barker, a history of what Farley called &quot;the bloodiest county in America.&quot; The book met with mixed reviews; some residents said it portrayed the county as too lawless, while others believed the book told the county&#x27;s history accurately.

In 2016 Mingo County was &quot;one of the places in America most touched by opioids.&quot;

In 2023, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced funding for a clean ammonia production facility to be placed in Mingo County, known as the Adams Fork Energy clean ammonia project. It will be the second-largest ammonia facility in the nation, producing 2 million pounds of ammonia per year.

==Politics==
The youngest of West Virginia&#x27;s 55 counties, Mingo County was created from deeply secessionist Logan County. Consequently, for the 110 years following its creation, Mingo County was staunchly Democratic, voting for Walter Mondale—who came within 3,819 votes of losing all 50 states—by a two-to-one margin in 1984, and voting Republican only for William Howard Taft in 1908, Herbert Hoover in 1928 due to widespread anti-Catholic sentiment against Al Smith, and Richard Nixon against the left-wing George McGovern in 1972. Like all of West Virginia, since 2000 a combination of declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social and environmental issues has produced a dramatic swing to the Republican Party. Mingo County last backed a Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, when John Kerry carried the county by 13 percentage points despite losing the national election and popular vote. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden lost the county by more than 70 percentage points to Republican Donald Trump despite winning the presidential election.

In state elections, Mingo County remained very Democratic up until the mid-2010s. In the 2018 U.S. Senate election, Democrat Joe Manchin lost Mingo County despite winning statewide. Nonetheless, Democrats enjoy a 2-to-1 advantage in party registration as of October 2023.

<text>Mineral County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is part of the Cumberland metropolitan area, together with Cumberland, Maryland. As of the 2020 census, the population was 26,938. Its county seat is Keyser. The county was founded in 1866.

==History==

===Ancient history===

Indigenous peoples lived throughout the highlands along rivers in this area for thousands of years. Archeologists have identified artifacts of the Adena culture, dating from 1000 BC to 200 BC. They were among the several early Native American cultures who built major earthwork mounds for ceremonial and burial use. Remnants of their culture have been found throughout West Virginia. They were followed by other indigenous peoples.

With the growth of fur trading to the north after European encounter in the coastal areas, the nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot; (or Iroquois Confederacy), based in present-day New York, moved into the Ohio Valley in search of new hunting grounds. By the 17th century they had conquered other tribes, pushed them out to the west, and preserved the area for hunting.

===1863 to present===
It was not until after West Virginia became a state in 1863 that present-day Mineral County was organized. It was created in 1866 by an Act of the West Virginia Legislature from the existing Hampshire County. The name was selected due to its reserves of minerals, especially coal - although coal, a type of sedimentary rock, is not a mineral because it does not have a crystalline structure.

The seminal point in the creation of the county was the arrival of the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1842. The county seat of Keyser was named for an executive of the railroad.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. After its formation in 1866, Mineral County was divided into seven townships: Cabin Run, Elk, Frankfort, Mill Creek, New Creek, Piedmont, and Welton. Mill Creek Township was returned to Hampshire County in 1871, and in 1872 the six remaining townships became magisterial districts. Except for minor adjustments, they remained relatively unchanged until the 1980s, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

===Mountains===
The Allegheny Front in West Virginia lies in Mineral County and includes the highest point in the county. Known as &quot;the Pinnacle&quot;, it is above sea level. From the abandoned fire tower four states are visible, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia. The Allegheny Front is the largest mountain in the county; on the north end it is also known as Green Mountain.Prior to 1830, the only medical aid available to the settlers was common sense, home remedies and liberal dosages of prayer. The first resident physician in what is now Mineral County was Dr. John Green, who was born in Bolton, England, in 1799, and immigrated to America in 1828. He lived on a farm, which he called Iceland, located near the ridge of the escarpment about three miles from Sulphur City. The area was later named for his son, Tom Green, and is known as Green Mountain.

==Politics==
After having leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party between the New Deal and Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, most of West Virginia has, since 2000, seen a swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social issues. Mineral County, in contrast, was formed from the Unionist portion of Hampshire County following the Civil War and has always leaned Republican, although it has never been nearly so rock-ribbed as analogously created Grant County. Nonetheless, Mineral County would not vote Democratic between 1888 and 1932 inclusive – although voting for Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 – and the last Democrat to carry the county was Jimmy Carter in 1976.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Mercer County was divided into five districts: Beaver Pond, East River, Jumping Branch, Plymouth, and Rock. In the 1970s, Mercer County&#x27;s five historic districts were consolidated into three new magisterial districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3. The new districts were renamed &quot;District I&quot;, &quot;District II&quot; and &quot;District III&quot; during the 1980s.

As with most of West Virginia, extensive unionization caused the county to swing to the Democratic Party during most of the twentieth century, but an extremely rapid swing towards the Republican Party has occurred since 2000, due to declining unionization, along with regional views on environmental, social and cultural issues that are increasingly at odds with the national Democratic Party.

<text>The Boeing 727 is an American narrow-body airliner that was developed and produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

After the heavier 707 quad-jet was introduced in 1958, Boeing addressed the demand for shorter flight lengths from smaller airports.
On December 5, 1960, the 727 was launched with 40 orders each from United Airlines and Eastern Air Lines.
The first 727-100 rolled out on November 27, 1962, first flew on February 9, 1963, and entered service with Eastern on February 1, 1964.
The only trijet aircraft to be produced by Boeing, the 727 is powered by three Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D low-bypass turbofans below a T-tail, one on each side of the rear fuselage and a center one fed through an S-duct below the tail.
It shares its six-abreast upper fuselage cross-section and cockpit with the 707 that was also later used on the 737.
The 727-100 typically carries 106 passengers in two classes over , or 129 in a single class.

Launched in 1965, the stretched 727-200 flew in July 1967 and entered service with Northeast Airlines that December.
The longer variant typically carries 134 passengers in two classes over , or 155 in a single class.
A freighter and a &quot;Quick Change&quot; convertible version were also offered.
The 727 was used for domestic flights and on international flights within its range.
Airport noise regulations have led to hush kit installations. 
Its last commercial passenger flight was in January 2019.
It was succeeded by the 757 and larger variants of the 737.

There have been 353 incidents involving the Boeing 727.

Production ended in September 1984 with 1,832 having been built. The 727 was an industry workhorse for many years, often fondly referred to as &quot;the DC-3 of the Jet Age.&quot;

==Development==

The Boeing 727 design was a compromise among United Airlines, American Airlines, and Eastern Air Lines; each of the three had developed requirements for a jet airliner to serve smaller cities with shorter runways and fewer passengers. United Airlines requested a four-engine aircraft for its flights to high-altitude airports, especially its hub at Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado. American Airlines, which was operating the four-engined Boeing 707 and Boeing 720, requested a twin-engined aircraft for efficiency. Eastern Airlines wanted a third engine for its overwater flights to the Caribbean, since at that time twin-engine commercial flights were limited by regulations to routes with 60-minute maximum flying time to an airport (see ETOPS). Eventually, the three airlines agreed on a trijet design for the new aircraft.
In 1959, Lord Douglas, chairman of British European Airways (BEA), suggested that Boeing and de Havilland Aircraft Company (later Hawker Siddeley) work together on their trijet designs, the 727 and D.H.121 Trident, respectively. The two designs had a similar layout, the 727 being slightly larger. At that time Boeing intended to use three Allison AR963 turbofan engines, license-built versions of the Rolls-Royce RB163 Spey used by the Trident. Boeing and de Havilland each sent engineers to the other company&#x27;s locations to evaluate each other&#x27;s designs, but Boeing eventually decided against the joint venture. De Havilland had wanted Boeing to license-build the D.H.121, while Boeing felt that the aircraft needed to be designed for the American market, with six-abreast seating and the ability to use runways as short as .

In 1960, Pratt &amp; Whitney was looking for a customer for its new JT8D turbofan design study, based on its J52 (JT8A) turbojet, while United and Eastern were interested in a Pratt &amp; Whitney alternative to the RB163 Spey. Once Pratt &amp; Whitney agreed to go ahead with development of the JT8D, Eddie Rickenbacker, chairman of the board of Eastern, told Boeing that the airline preferred the JT8D for its 727s. Boeing had not offered the JT8D, as it was about heavier than the RB163, though slightly more powerful; the RB163 was also further along in development than the JT8D. Boeing reluctantly agreed to offer the JT8D as an option on the 727, and it later became the sole powerplant.

With high-lift devices on its wing, the 727 could use shorter runways than most earlier jets (e.g. the runway at Key West International Airport).

Later 727 models were stretched to carry more passengers and replaced earlier jet airliners such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, as well as aging propeller airliners such as the DC-4, DC-6, DC-7, and the Lockheed Constellations on short- and medium-haul routes.

For over a decade, more 727s were built per year than any other jet airliner; in 1984, production ended with 1,832 built and 1,831 delivered, the highest total for any jet airliner until the 737 surpassed it in the early 1990s.

==Design==

The airliner&#x27;s middle engine (engine 2) at the very rear of the fuselage gets air from an inlet ahead of the vertical fin through an S-shaped duct. This S-duct proved to be troublesome in that flow distortion in the duct induced a surge in the centerline engine on the take-off of the first flight of the 727-100. This was fixed by the addition of several large vortex generators in the inside of the first bend of the duct.

The 727 was designed for smaller airports, so independence from ground facilities was an important requirement. This led to one of the 727&#x27;s most distinctive features: the built-in airstair that opens from the rear underbelly of the fuselage, which initially could be opened in flight. Hijacker D. B. Cooper used this hatch when he parachuted from the back of a 727, as it was flying over the Pacific Northwest. Boeing subsequently modified the design with the Cooper vane so that the airstair could not be lowered in flight. The design included an auxiliary power unit (APU), which allowed electrical and air-conditioning systems to run independently of a ground-based power supply, and without having to start one of the main engines. An unusual design feature is that the APU is mounted in a hole in the keel beam web, in the main landing gear bay. The 727 is equipped with a retractable tailskid that is designed to protect the aircraft in the event of an over-rotation on takeoff. The 727&#x27;s fuselage has an outer diameter of . This allows six-abreast seating (three per side) and a single aisle when wide coach-class seats are installed. An unusual feature of the fuselage is the difference between the lower lobe forward and aft of the wing as the higher fuselage height of the center section was simply retained towards the rear.

Nosewheel brakes were available as an option to reduce braking distance on landing, which provided reduction in braking distances of up to .

The 727 proved to be such a reliable and versatile airliner that it came to form the core of many startup airlines&#x27; fleets. The 727 was successful with airlines worldwide partly because it could use smaller runways while still flying medium-range routes. This allowed airlines to carry passengers from cities with large populations, but smaller airports to worldwide tourist destinations. One of the features that gave the 727 its ability to land on shorter runways was its clean wing design. With no wing-mounted engines, leading-edge devices (Krueger, or hinged, flaps on the inner wing and extendable leading edge slats out to the wingtip) and trailing-edge lift enhancement equipment (triple-slotted, Fowler flaps) could be used on the entire wing. Together, these high-lift devices produced a maximum wing lift coefficient of 3.0 (based on the flap-retracted wing area). The 727 was stable at very low speeds compared to other early jets, but some domestic carriers learned after review of various accidents that the 40° flap setting could result in a higher-than-desired sink rate or a stall on final approach. These carriers&#x27; Pilots&#x27; Operation Handbooks disallowed using more than 30° of flaps on the 727, even going so far as installing plates on the flap lever slot to prevent selection of more than 30° of flaps.

===Noise===
The 727 is one of the noisiest commercial jetliners, categorized as Stage 2 by the U.S. Noise Control Act of 1972, which mandated the gradual introduction of quieter Stage 3 aircraft. The 727&#x27;s JT8D jet engines use older low-bypass turbofan technology, whereas Stage 3 aircraft use the more efficient and quieter high-bypass turbofan design. When the Stage 3 requirement was being proposed, Boeing engineers analyzed the possibility of incorporating quieter engines on the 727. They determined that the JT8D-200 engine could be used on the two side-mounted pylons. The JT8D-200 engines are much quieter than the original JT8D-1 through -17 variant engines that power the 727, as well as more fuel efficient due to the higher bypass ratio, but the structural changes to fit the larger-diameter engine ( fan diameter in the JT8D-200 compared to in the JT8D-1 through -17) into the fuselage at the number two engine location were prohibitive.

Current regulations require that a 727, or any other Stage 2 noise jetliner in commercial service must be retrofitted with a hush kit to reduce engine noise to Stage 3 levels to continue to fly in U.S. airspace. These regulations have been in effect since December 31, 1999. One such hush kit is offered by FedEx, and has been purchased by over 60 customers. Aftermarket winglet kits, originally developed by Valsan Partners and later marketed by Quiet Wing Corp. have been installed on many 727s to reduce noise at lower speeds, as well as to reduce fuel consumption. In addition, Raisbeck Engineering developed packages to enable 727s to meet the Stage 3 noise requirements. These packages managed to get light- and medium-weight 727s to meet Stage 3 with simple changes to the flap and slat schedules. For heavier-weight 727s, exhaust mixers must be added to meet Stage 3. American Airlines ordered and took delivery of 52 Raisbeck 727 Stage 3 systems. Other customers included TWA, Pan Am, Air Algérie, TAME, and many smaller airlines.

Since September 1, 2010, 727 jetliners (including those with a hush kit) are banned from some Australian airports because they are too loud.

==Operational history==


In addition to domestic flights of medium range, the 727 was popular with international passenger airlines. The range of flights it could cover (and the additional safety added by the third engine) meant that the 727 proved efficient for short- to medium-range international flights in areas around the world.

The 727 also proved popular with cargo and charter airlines. FedEx Express introduced 727s in 1978. The 727s were the backbone of its fleet until the 2000s; FedEx began replacing them with Boeing 757s in 2007. Many cargo airlines worldwide employ the 727 as a workhorse, since, as it is being phased out of U.S. domestic service because of noise regulations, it becomes available to overseas users in areas where such noise regulations have not yet been instituted. Charter airlines Sun Country, Champion Air, and Ryan International Airlines all started with 727 aircraft.

The 727 had some military uses as well. Since the aft stair could be opened in flight, the Central Intelligence Agency used them to drop agents and supplies behind enemy lines in Vietnam. In early 1988, The Iraqi Air Force modified a Boeing 727 by fitting it with Thomson-CSF TMV-018 Syrel pods for ESM and Raphael-TH pods with side looking radar. Known as &#x27;Faw-727&#x27;, it was reportedly used as an ELINT platform in the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 (during which it was briefly locked on by a Kuwaiti Mirage F1 on August 2) and the subsequent Iraqi monitoring of Coalition forces during Desert Shield.

The 727 has proven to be popular where the airline serves airports with gravel, or otherwise lightly improved, runways. The Canadian airline First Air, for example, previously used a 727-100C to serve the communities of Resolute Bay and Arctic Bay in Nunavut, whose Resolute Bay Airport and former Nanisivik Airport both have gravel runways. The high-mounted engines greatly reduce the risk of foreign object damage.

A military version, the Boeing C-22, was operated as a medium-range transport aircraft by the Air National Guard and National Guard Bureau to airlift personnel. A total of three C-22Bs were in use, all assigned to the 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard.

At the start of the 21st century, the 727 remained in service with a few large airlines. Faced with higher fuel costs, lower passenger volumes due to the post-9/11 economic climate, increasing restrictions on airport noise, and the extra expenses of maintaining older planes and paying flight engineers&#x27; salaries, most major airlines phased out their 727s; they were replaced by twin-engined aircraft, which are quieter and more fuel-efficient. Modern airliners also have a smaller flight deck crew of two pilots, while the 727 required two pilots and a flight engineer. Delta Air Lines, the last major U.S. carrier to do so, retired its last 727 from scheduled service in April 2003. Northwest Airlines retired its last 727 from charter service in June 2003. Many airlines replaced their 727s with either the 737-800 or the Airbus A320; both are close in size to the 727-200. , a total of 109 Boeing 727s were in commercial service with 34 airlines; three years later, the total had fallen to 64 airframes in service with 26 airlines.

On March 2, 2016, the first 727 produced (N7001U), which first flew on February 9, 1963, made a flight to a museum after extensive restoration. The 727-100 had carried about three million passengers during its years of service. Originally a prototype, it was later sold to United Airlines, which donated it to the Museum of Flight in Seattle in 1991. The jet was restored over 25 years by the museum and was ferried from Paine Field in Everett, Washington to Boeing Field in Seattle, where it was put on permanent display at the Aviation Pavilion. The Federal Aviation Administration granted the museum a special permit for the 15-minute flight. The museum&#x27;s previous 727-223, tail number N874AA, was donated to the National Airline History Museum in Kansas City and was planned to be flown to its new home once FAA ferry approval was granted. After a series of financial problems with the restoration, N874AA was seized by Boeing Field for nonpayment of storage fees in 2021 and subsequently broken up and scrapped.

Iran Aseman Airlines, the last passenger airline operator, made the worldwide last scheduled 727 passenger flight on January 13, 2019 between Zahedan and Tehran.

==Variants==

&quot;Data from: &quot;Boeing Aircraft since 1916&quot;

The two series of 727 are the initial -100 (originally only two figures as in -30), which was launched in 1960 and entered service in February 1964, and the -200 series, which was launched in 1965 and entered service in December 1967.

===727-100===


The first 727-100 (N7001U) flew on February 9, 1963. FAA type approval was awarded on December 24 of that year, with initial delivery to United Airlines on October 29, 1963, to allow pilot training to commence. The first service was flown by Eastern Air Lines on February 1, 1964, between Miami, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia.

A total of 571 Boeing 727-00/100 series aircraft were delivered (407 -100s, 53 -100Cs, and 111 -100QCs), the last in October 1972. One 727-100 was retained by Boeing, bringing total production to 572.

The -100 designation was assigned retroactively to distinguish the original short-body version. Actual aircraft followed a &quot;727-00&quot; pattern. Aircraft were delivered for United Airlines as 727-22, for American Airlines as 727-23, and so on (not -122, -123, etc.) and these designations were retained even after the advent of the 727-200.

;727-100C
Convertible passenger cargo version, additional freight door and strengthened floor and floor beams, three alternative fits:
*94 mixed-class passengers
*52 mixed-class passengers and four cargo pallets ()
*Eight cargo pallets ()

;727-100QC
QC stands for Quick Change. This is similar to the convertible version with a roller-bearing floor for palletised galley and seating and cargo to allow a much faster changeover time of 30 minutes.

;727-100QF
QF stands for Quiet Freighter. A cargo conversion for United Parcel Service, these were re-engined with Stage 3-compliant Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans.

;Boeing C-22A
:A single 727-30 acquired from the Federal Aviation Administration, this aircraft was originally delivered to Lufthansa. It served mostly with United States Southern Command flying from Panama City / Howard Air Force Base.

;Boeing C-22B
:Four 727-35 aircraft were acquired from National Airlines by the United States Air Force for transporting Air National Guard and National Guard personnel.

===727-200===

A stretched version of the 727-100, the -200 is longer () than the -100 (). A fuselage section (&quot;plug&quot;) was added in front of the wings and another 10 ft fuselage section was added behind them. The wing span and height remain the same on both the -100 and -200 (, respectively). The original 727-200 had the same maximum gross weight as the 727-100; however, as the aircraft evolved, a series of higher gross weights and more powerful engines were introduced along with other improvements, and from line number 881, 727-200s are dubbed -200 Advanced. The aircraft gross weight eventually increased from for the latest versions. The dorsal intake of the number-two engine was also redesigned to be round in shape, rather than oval as it was on the -100 series.

The first 727-200 flew on July 27, 1967, and received FAA certification on November 30, 1967. The first delivery was made on December 14, 1967, to Northeast Airlines. A total of 310 727-200s were delivered before the -200 was replaced on the production line by the 727-200 Advanced in 1972.
;727-200C
A convertible passenger cargo version; only one was built.

;727-200 Advanced 

The Advanced version of the 727-200 was introduced in 1970. It featured powerful engines, fuel capacity and MTOW () increased the range from or by %. After the first delivery in mid-1972, Boeing eventually raised production to more than a hundred per year to meet demand by the late 1970s. Of the passenger model of the 727-200 Advanced, a total of 935 were delivered, after which it had to give way to a new generation of aircraft.

;727-200F Advanced
A freighter version of the 727-200 Advanced became available in 1981, designated the Series 200F Advanced. Powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17A engines, it featured a strengthened fuselage structure, an by forward main deck freight door, and a windowless cabin. Fifteen of these aircraft were built, all for Federal Express. This was the last production variant of the 727 to be developed by Boeing; the last 727 aircraft completed by Boeing was a 727-200F Advanced.
;Super 27
Certificated by Valsan Partners in December 1988 and marketed by Goodrich from 1997, the side engines are replaced by more efficient, quieter JT8D-217C/219, and the center engine gains a hush kit for $8.6 million (but loses the thrust reverser) (2000): fuel consumption is reduced by 10-12%, range and restricted airfield performance are improved.

;Boeing C-22C
A single 727-212 aircraft was operated by the USAF.

===Proposed===
;727-300
A proposed 169-seat version was developed in consultation with United Airlines in 1972, which initially expressed an interest in ordering 50 aircraft. Also, interest was shown from Indian Airlines for a one-class version with 180 seats. The fuselage would have been lengthened by and the undercarriage strengthened. The three engines would have been replaced by two more powerful JT8D-217 engines under the T tail. Many cockpit components would have been in common with the 737-200 and improved engine management systems would have eliminated the need for the flight engineer. United did not proceed with its order and Indian Airlines instead ordered the larger Airbus A300, so the project was cancelled in 1976.

;727-400
A concept with a fuselage and two high-bypass turbofan engines under the wings (but retaining the T tail) was proposed in 1977. More compact systems, a redesign of the internal space, and removing the need for the flight engineer would have increased the capacity to 189 seats in a two-class configuration. After only a few months, the concept was developed into the Boeing 7N7 design, which eventually became the Boeing 757.

=== Other variants ===
Faw-727

This Boeing 727 was reportedly modified by Iraq in early 1988 to serve as an ELINT platform. It was used during the invasion of Kuwait and Operation Desert Shield.

==Operators==
===Commercial operators===

, 11 Boeing 727s were in commercial service, operated by the following companies:

*Aerosucre (2)
*Air Class Lineas Aereas (2)
*IFL Group (2)
*USA Jet Airlines (2)
*Oil Spill Response (2, operated by 2 Excel Aviation)
*UniWorld Air Cargo (1)
*Zero Gravity Corporation (1)

===Government, military, and other operators===


In addition, the 727 has seen sporadic government use, having flown for the Belgian, Yugoslav, Mexican, New Zealand, and Panama air forces, along with a small group of government agencies that have used it.

=== Private aircraft ===
A number of 727s have been outfitted for use as private aircraft, especially since the early 1990s, when major airlines began to eliminate older 727-100 models from their fleet. Donald Trump traveled in a former American Airlines 727-100 with a dining room, a bedroom, and shower facilities known as Trump Force One before upgrading to a larger Boeing 757 in 2009; Peter Nygård acquired a 727-100 for private use in 2005. American financier Jeffrey Epstein owned a private 727 nicknamed the &quot;Lolita Express&quot;. The Gettys bought N311AG from Revlon in 1986, and Gordon Getty acquired the aircraft in 2001.

==Accidents and incidents==
, a total of 353 incidents involving 727s had occurred, including 120 hull-loss accidents resulting in a total of 4,211 fatalities.

<doc id="91031" wikidata="Q501804" url="?curid=91031" title="McDowell County, West Virginia">
<text>McDowell County is a county in the State of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 19,111. Its county seat is Welch. McDowell County is the southernmost county in the state. It was created in 1858 by the Virginia General Assembly and named for Virginia Governor James McDowell. It became a part of West Virginia in 1863, when several Union-affiliated counties seceded from the state of Virginia during the American Civil War. McDowell County is located in the Cumberland Mountains, part of the Appalachia region.

Due mostly to a decline in employment in the coal mining industry, McDowell County&#x27;s population has decreased from almost 100,000 in 1950 to less than 20,000 in 2020. The people of McDowell County suffer high rates of drug abuse and poverty, and have a life expectancy well below the national average.

==History==
On February 20, 1858, McDowell County was formed from the northern portion of Tazewell County, Virginia. In 1861, as the nation lurched toward civil war, delegates from McDowell County voted in favor of Virginia&#x27;s secession from the United States. The northwestern counties of the region were Union-affiliated and voted to secede from Virginia the following year, but McDowell, Greenbrier, Logan, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Webster, and Wyoming counties in the southern section all refused to participate. The status of these eight counties would be decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Virginia v. West Virginia&quot;.

McDowell was one of fifty former Virginia counties that were recognized as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. The same year, the residents of McDowell County chose Perryville, now English, then the most populous town, as their new county seat. However, in 1866 the state legislature relocated the county seat to a farm near the mouth of Mill Creek. There it remained until 1874, when it returned to Perryville. The location of the county seat remained in dispute until 1892, when it moved to Welch.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the largely rural state, where population density was low. In 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. McDowell County was divided into three districts: Big Creek, Elkhorn, and Sandy River. In the 1890s, Browns Creek District was formed from a portion of Elkhorn, and North Fork District was created from parts of Browns Creek and Elkhorn. A sixth district, Adkin, was created from part of Elkhorn District in the early 1900s. These districts remained stable until the 1980s, when Adkin, Elkhorn, and North Fork were consolidated into the district of North Elkin.

Referring to the unconventional demographics and political state of McDowell County, a local newspaper editor described the county as &quot;the Free State of McDowell&quot;, a description that has stuck in the popular imagination. The origin of this moniker is unknown. Tom Whittico, the founder and first editor of The McDowell Times—the first African-American paper in West Virginia—said he used it because African Americans had greater electoral power, civil freedoms, and freedom from segregation in McDowell County than in other locations in the state.

McDowell County had the first World War One Memorial to honor black soldiers.

By the first half of the 20th century, McDowell County&#x27;s economy was dominated by coal mining. In 1950, it was the &quot;leading coal producing county&quot; in the United States. Sixteen percent of the county&#x27;s population in 1950 was employed in the coal mining sector. However, in the next few decades major breakthroughs in mechanization in the coal industry resulted in job declines. By 1960 the mining workforce had decreased from around 16,000 to around 7,000. Many people left because of the lack of jobs, but people with longstanding family ties were reluctant to do so.

While running for president, John F. Kennedy visited McDowell County and promised to send help if elected. His first executive order created the Food Stamps program and the first recipients of food stamps were in McDowell County. In May 1963, the increasing rate of poverty in McDowell County led President Kennedy to remark in a speech given in the city of Welch:
I don&#x27;t think any American can be satisfied to find in McDowell County, in West Virginia, 20 or 25 percent of the people of that county out of work, not for 6 weeks or 12 weeks, but for a year, 2, 3, or 4 years.

==Geography==
McDowell County, the southernmost county in West Virginia, is located at . It is bordered by Tazewell County, Virginia, to the south; Buchanan County, Virginia, to the west; Mingo County to the northwest; Wyoming County to the north; and Mercer County to the east. The county is located in the Cumberland Mountains, a sub-region of the Appalachian Mountains. The highest elevation in the county is approximately on the northwest slope of Flat Top Mountain.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water. The county is roughly in the shape of a semi circle, with the border following the mountains around the county.

==Demographics==
The county hit its peak of population in 1950 with almost 99,000 people, but job losses in the next decades caused sharp declines in population.

===2020 census===

As of the 2020 census, there were 19,111 people, 7,483 households, 4,627 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 9,344 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 84.7% White, 11.3% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.1% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from some other races and 3.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.0% of the population.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 census, there were 22,113 people, 9,176 households, and 6,196 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 11,322 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 89.1% White, 9.5% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian, 0.1% Asian, 0.0% from other races, and 1.1% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 0.4% of the population. The largest ancestry groups were: 13.7% Irish, 12.0% German, 11.5% English, 8.0% American, 2.8% Sub-Saharan African, 2.7% Italian, 2.0% Dutch, and 1.1% Scotch-Irish. 

Of the 9,176 households, 28.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.1% were married couples living together, 13.9% had a female householder with no husband present, 32.5% were non-families, and 28.8% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 2.86. The median age was 43.8 years.

The median income for a household in the county was $22,154 and the median income for a family was $28,413. Males had a median income of $31,229 versus $26,776 for females. The per capita income for the county was $12,955. About 27.5% of families and 32.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 44.3% of those under age 18 and 20.1% of those age 65 or over.

===Life expectancy===
Of 3,142 counties in the United States in 2013, McDowell County ranked last in the life expectancy of both male and female residents. Males in McDowell County lived an average of 63.5 years and females lived an average of 71.5 years, compared to the national average for life expectancy of 76.5 for males and 81.2 for females. Moreover, the average life expectancy in McDowell County declined by 3.2 years for males and 4.1 years for females between 1985 and 2013, compared to a national average for the same period of an increased life span of 5.5 years for men and 3.1 years for women. High rates of smoking and obesity and a low level of physical activity appear to be contributing factors to the declining life expectancy for both sexes.

In 2020, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ranked McDowell County as 55th of 55 counties in West Virginia in &quot;health outcomes,&quot; as measured by length and quality of life.

====Drug-induced deaths====
In 2015, McDowell County had the highest rate of drug-induced deaths of any county in the United States, with 141 deaths per 100,000 people. The rate for the United States as a whole was 14.7 per 100,000 people. Neighboring Wyoming County had the second highest rate.

==Economy==
The county has been classified as a &quot;food desert&quot; by the USDA. In 2017, there were only two full-sized grocery stores to serve the county&#x27;s . The county&#x27;s only Walmart Supercenter, the county&#x27;s largest employer, closed in 2016.

Financial services remain scant in the area. In 1999, The First National Bank of Keystone, the only bank located in the coal town of Keystone and the town&#x27;s major employer at the time, was closed by the FDIC due to fraud. Management had been falsifying the bank&#x27;s financial statements by booking income from loans the bank did not own, giving the appearance that the bank was generating large profits when it was in fact insolvent. At the height of the scandal, executives buried large volumes of documents in a trench in an attempt to conceal the fraud from the bank&#x27;s accounting firm and from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

===Poverty===
In 2022, McDowell was the 16th-poorest county in the U.S. (out of 3,143 counties), with a median annual household income of $28,235. The percentage of the population living in poverty was estimated at 37.6 percent. This compares with a median annual household income of $67,521 and a poverty rate of 11.4 percent in the U.S. as a whole.

==Politics==
The power of industrial and mining political systems turned the county towards the Republican Party between 1890 and 1932, even supporting William Howard Taft during the divided 1912 presidential election. However, starting in 1936, the county realigned towards the Democratic Party, given its strong unionization in the coal mining sector, voting for the Democratic candidate in every election from 1936 to 2008 except Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 landslide.

Since 1996, the county has trended Republican again, due to the prevailing environmentalist stances in the Democratic Party regarded as hostile towards coal mining interests. The county voted Republican in 2012 for the first time since 1972, and has since consistently voted Republican. In 2024, Republican Donald Trump won the largest share of the vote ever for a Republican presidential nominee in the county, garnering 79.4% of the vote. 










==Government==
==Education==
McDowell County Schools operates the county&#x27;s public K-12 education system of 7 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, and 2 public high schools in McDowell County, which are Mount View High School and River View High School. The county also has a private school, Twinbranch Pentecostal Christian Academy which is located in Twinbranch.

McDowell County Schools were under state control as a &#x27;take-over&#x27; county from 2001 to 2013. Some medical services have been brought onsite into schools to reduce student absenteeism among families with only one car, and personal items such as sneakers and backpacks are now made available to students. A mixed use, multistory building in Welch aimed at reducing the housing shortage for teachers opened in 2022.

==In popular culture==
Melville Davisson Post used McDowell County as the setting of his short story &quot;Once In Jeopardy&quot;. This 1890s tale of the working out of a legal problem is rich in description of the people, customs, politics, and recent history of the area, including the impact of the railroad coming through and the rise of Republican influence.

Author and NASA engineer Homer Hickam grew up in Coalwood, McDowell County. His memoir &quot;October Sky&quot;, which was adapted into a 1999 Hollywood film, is based on his childhood amateur rocket building experiences in Coalwood.

<text>Mason County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,453. Its county seat and largest city is Point Pleasant. The county was founded in 1804 and named for George Mason, delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. Before the Civil War, the county was in the State of Virginia.

Mason County is part of the Point Pleasant, WV-OH Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In the second half of 1749, the French explorer, Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville, claimed French sovereignty over the Ohio Valley, burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers, naming the place Point Pleasant.

In the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel Andrew Lewis (1720–1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of Shawnee and Mingo warriors led by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk (&quot;ca.&quot; 1720–1777). The event is celebrated locally as the &quot;First Battle of the American Revolutionary War&quot; and in 1908 the U.S. Senate authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775–1783), but as a part of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War (1774). White settlers may have established their permanent settlement by 1774, for Col. Lewis had established &quot;Camp Point Pleasant&quot; at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name.

According to &quot;Hardesty&#x27;s West Virginia Counties&quot; (1883), regarding the first white settlers in Mason County south of Point Pleasant: All that part of the district lying on the Ohio river bottoms above Eighteen-mile Creek, was included in the grant made by Congress to the heirs of General Mercer, who was killed at the battle of Princeton, New Jersey, January 3, 1777, while fighting by the side of Washington; hence the name Mercer Bottom. Who located and surveyed the lands cannot now be learned, but his grandson, Charles Fenton Mercer, of Virginia, afterward put the lands in market and sold them in quantities to suit purchasers. Thomas Hannan, whose name is preserved in that of the district, was the first actual settler - locating in the year 1790. Andrew Fleming and a Mr. Mercer, two hunters, had previously erected a cabin on the land which he purchased, and this was occupied by him until he could build a better one. Soon Jesse George purchased seventy acres of land at the mouth of Flatfoot Creek ... and became the second actual settler. Then came John Hereford, Robert Hereford, Thomas Powell, Edward S. Menager, John Morris — who discovered the first salt water on Kanawha river — George Withers, Robert Cremeans, James George, Rev. John Canterbury ...

The settlement at Point Pleasant did not receive an official charter until 1794. The first road through what later became Mason County was laid out by Thomas Hannan (1757-1835) in 1798 under contract to the federal government. It traversed the distance from present-day St Albans, (West) Virginia to Chillicothe, Ohio. This road (parts are still known as &quot;Hannan Trace Road&quot;) is one of the oldest roads in Ohio. It became a main highway connecting Chillicothe and points east during the time when that settlement served as the capital of the Northwest Territory and the first capital of Ohio.

The Virginia General Assembly officially created Mason County from Kanawha County on January 2, 1804. It was named for George Mason IV (1725–1792), known as the &quot;Father of the United States Bill of Rights&quot; and a Founding Father of the United States. By 1810, the total county population stood at almost two thousand people. Before the American Civil War it developed as a river port (farmers upstream on the Kanawha River could ship their goods to Point Pleasant and from there down the Ohio River and sometimes the Mississippi River to market) as well as coal.

In the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Mason County&#x27;s delegate, lawyer James H. Couch (1821-1899), although a slaveholder, voted against secession. Mason County then sent no delegates to the Virginia House of Delegates until West Virginia&#x27;s statehood, which Virginia&#x27;s House of Delegates refused to recognize, thus seating James Hutcheson who had been elected by Confederate soldiers in their camp. Meanwhile, William W. Newman claimed to represent Mason as well as nearby Jackson, Cabell, Wayne and Wirt counties throughout the war. Mason County sent more than 1000 men to the Union army and one company of 61 men to the Confederate Army (the 37th Virginia Infantry). In March 1863, in the only wartime skirmish in Mason County, during the Jones-Imboden Raid, the 6th Virginia Cavalry and 8th Virginia Cavalry attacked the Mason County Courthouse, where they believed munitions stored, leaving bullet holes in the walls until a replacement was built in 1954.

Point Pleasant&#x27;s Battle Monument State Park, also known as Tu-Endie-Wei, was dedicated on October 10, 1901, to commemorate the Battle of Point Pleasant, at the time claimed to have been the first battle of the Revolutionary War. It significantly predates the 1928 establishment of the West Virginia state park system. The park includes the tavern begun in 1796 by Walter Newman, later operated as a museum of local history by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The Marietta Manufacturing Company (shipbuilders) moved to Point Pleasant in 1915; the facility continued to build mine-planting vessels and other small ships through World War II, but closed in 1970. During World War II the West Virginia Ordnance Works manufactured TNT in Mason County about 5 miles north of Point Pleasant; it was later repurposed as the McClintic Wildlife Management Area as well as an industrial park. The county&#x27;s worst disaster occurred on December 15, 1967, when the Silver Bridge, a link-suspension bridge which had connected Point Pleasant to Kanauga, Ohio along U.S. Route 35 since 1928, collapsed during the rush hour commute. The disaster killed 46 people and injured nine others, and drew attention to poor bridge maintenance practices, as well as bridge loads greatly exceeding their original tolerances. The important bridge was replaced two years later by the Silver Memorial Bridge, which stands today.

In 1981, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture acquired land that had been farmed after the Civil War by General John McCausland, the last fully confirmed Confederate general to die. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, it now operates as Smithland Farm. The River Museum opened on May 1, 2004, but closed in 2018 after a disastrous fire.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.1%) is water.

===Territorial evolution===
Prior to its establishment in 1804, the land that would become Mason County was part of the vast and largely unorganized territory claimed by Virginia west of the Alleghenies. It was attached to various counties beginning with Orange in 1734, Augusta in 1738, and Botetourt in 1770. Beginning in 1772, the portion of Mason County south of the Kanawha River was part of Fincastle County, the West Virginia portion of which became Monroe County in 1777. The remaining West Virginia portion of Botetourt County, including the northern part of present-day Mason County, became Greenbrier County in 1778. In 1789, the western portions of Greenbrier and Monroe Counties, extending to the Ohio and Big Sandy Rivers, were combined to form Kanawha County.

Mason County was separated from Kanawha County in 1804, including all of its current territory, as well as portions of what are now Jackson, Putnam, and Roane Counties. The northern and western boundaries were formed by the Ohio River, and the county&#x27;s southwestern boundary, originally with Kanawha County, and now with Cabell, remains unchanged. Until 1831, Mason County shared a boundary with Wood County, running southeasterly from the Ohio River north of Ravenswood to the northwestern boundary of Kanawha County, thence in a southwesterly direction to the present border with Cabell County. The formation of Jackson County in 1831 from portions of Mason, Wood, and Kanawha Counties removed the eastern portion of Mason County, including the part now in Roane County, while the formation of Putnam County from portions of Mason, Cabell, and Kanawha Counties in 1848 removed the southeastern portion of the county. This was the last major change to Mason County&#x27;s boundaries.

After West Virginia gained its independence from Virginia in 1863, the state&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the goal of placing authority in the hands of local governments. Mason County was divided into ten townships, each of which was named after a pioneer settler of Mason County. However, township government proved impractical across the heavily rural state, with citizens unable to meet on a regular basis, and inadequate tax revenue to meet township responsibilities. Following the adoption of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, and the county courts (later county commissions) empowered to establish, consolidate, or otherwise modify them.

<text>Marshall County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. At the 2020 census, the population was 30,591. Its county seat is Moundsville. With its southern border at what would be a continuation of the Mason-Dixon line to the Ohio River, it forms the base of the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia.

Marshall County is part of the Wheeling metropolitan area.

Marshall County is home to the largest conical burial mound in North America, at Moundsville. Marshall County was formed in 1835 from Ohio County by act of the Virginia Assembly. In 1852, on Christmas Eve, workers completed the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s connection to the Ohio River at Rosby&#x27;s Rock in Marshall County. It more recently became home to the New Vrindaban community of Hare Krishnas, and Prabhupada&#x27;s Palace of Gold.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Native Americans occupied the area along the narrows of the Ohio River by 250 BCE and the Adena culture constructed the Grave Creek Mound by 100 B.C.E., which was the highest conical burial mound in what came to be the United States, with only that in Miamisburg, Ohio of even comparable size.
However, by the 18th century the area contained no permanent settlements. Tribes which hunted, foraged and made war in the area by that time included the Algonquian language speaking Delaware, Ottawa, Miami and Shawnee, and the Iroquoian language speaking Cherokee, Iroquois, Mingo, Mohawk, Wyandot/Huron and Seneca. 

Two major trails intersected in what would become Marshall County. One was a major roughly north–south path sometimes known as the Great Indian Warpath (other names included the &quot;Great Catawba War Path&quot;, &quot;Cherokee Path&quot; or &quot;Tennessee Path&quot;) which ran along the Great Appalachian Valley from what became Olean, New York through Uniontown, Pennsylvania and then split after crossing the Ohio River, such that various branches (in what became West Virginia) reached the Kanawha River or the Cheat River before proceeding southwest to Kentucky and Tennessee, or southeast toward the Carolinas and/or Alabama. Another major trail, more distinct in this area and proceeding east–west, was sometimes known as Braddock&#x27;s Road or Nemacolin&#x27;s Path after the native chieftain and trailblazer who assisted General Braddock and George Washington during their unsuccessful march through the Cumberland Narrows pass in the Appalachian Mountains seeking to capture Fort Duquesne in 1755. In 1811 this path was developed through Marshall County into the National Road as discussed below.

===Emigration and conflict===
In 1752, according to Christopher Gist&#x27;s diary, Gist explored the Ohio River Valley area in what became Marshall County on behalf of the Ohio Company, a group of Virginia investors, before the conflict which became known as the French and Indian War. The French explorer Sieur De la Salle had traveled on the Ohio River in 1669, and Captain deBlainville had buried lead plates staking France&#x27;s claim to the valley in 1749. English speakers attempted to strengthen their claims initially by settlement, much to the displeasure of local Native Americans. The British government prohibited colonists from officially settling in the area in the 1763 peace treaty following that war.

Nonetheless, emigrants crossed the mountains. John Wetzel staked a claim along Wheeling Creek in what is now Marshall County&#x27;s Sand Hill District in 1764 (building a fortification by 1769). The British concluded the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Iroquois in 1768, which purported to give them this area and much of the Ohio River valley, despite the claims of other native peoples, particularly the Algonquian-speaking tribes. The Zane brothers (Ebenezer, and later Andrew, Jonathan and Silas) built cabins at the confluence of Wheeling Creek and the Ohio River in 1770, and their settlement decades later became Wheeling. Joseph, James and Samuel Tomlinson built a cabin on the Flats of Grave Creek at what became Moundsville around the same time, but experienced &quot;Indian troubles&quot; upon returning the following spring, and despite fortifying it, left until 1773. In 1774, Native Americans decided to drive the settlers from their valley and attacked Michael Cresap&#x27;s settlement at Cresap&#x27;s Bottom. The British colonists and military fortified Fort Fincastle at what became Wheeling and which was renamed &quot;Fort Henry&quot; during the American Revolutionary War. Cresap gathered other settlers and counterattacked, continuing what became locally called Cresap&#x27;s War, or Dunmore&#x27;s War. In the only pitched battle of that war (considerably downstream of Marshall County), Virginia militia led by colonel Andrew Lewis defeated outnumbered native warriors led by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk at the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774.

The large Ohio River valley area which Virginians called the District of West Augusta (the first county organized west of the Appalachian Mountains) sent two delegates to the Virginia convention in 1775, which eventually established the Commonwealth of Virginia. The District was governed from Fort Dunmore (as Virginians renamed it by 1774, and which later became Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). In 1776, the Virginia General Assembly created the counties of Ohio, Monongalia and Yohogania from what had been the District of West Augusta. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also claimed much of this area, and established Westmoreland County with similar boundaries. Pennsylvania divided the area of Westmoreland County that Virginia considered Yohogania County into Fayette and Washington Counties in 1781 and 1783. It also negotiated its border with Maryland, and only ceded the area south of the Mason–Dixon line to the United States in 1787, when Virginia ceded its claims north of the Ohio River as well, allowing the Continental Congress to establish the Northwest Territory from the area west of both states&#x27; reduced claims.

Meanwhile, during the ongoing raids from Native Americans and their British allies, particularly during 1777, many settlers (including in what became Marshall County) left smaller blockhouses and retreated to Fort Redstone at Brownsville, Pennsylvania until the end of the American Revolutionary War. Nonetheless, hostilities continued, as the Wetzel brothers repulsed a raid on Beeler&#x27;s Station in 1782. In 1784, General George Washington was among the veteran patriots who bought or established land claims in Ohio County (in what later became Marshall County) as the revolutionary war ended. Clark&#x27;s Fort had been built in 1779 on Wheeling Creek at what became the Pennsylvania/Virginia boundary. Several additional blockhouses and forts were built in 1784, including Baker&#x27;s Station at Cresap (where the Warrior&#x27;s Trail reached the Ohio River), and another Clark&#x27;s Fort at Sherrard (on Wheeling Creek at what became the intersection of routes 88 and 86), and Martin&#x27;s Fort and Himes Blockhouse where Fish Creek joined the Ohio River. John Wetzel died during a raid on Baker&#x27;s Station in 1787.

Hostilities with local tribes did not formally end until the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. The following year the Virginia General Assembly split off the northernmost part of Ohio County as Brooke County, but what became Marshall County remained in Ohio County. (Point Pleasant, the location of the critical 1774 battle became a different county&#x27;s seat when Mason County was split from Kanawha County in 1804.)

===Towns, roads and railroads===
The first town in what became Marshall County, Elizabethtown (which would later become Moundsville), was established in 1798 and named for Joseph Tomlinson&#x27;s wife. In 1831 a second community, Mound City, was established across Grave Creek, which ultimately joined with the first and jointly became known as Moundsville. A road between Wheeling and Elizabethtown was opened through the efforts of Ohio County officials in 1810. The following year, the U.S. Congress began funding construction of the National Road, running from Cumberland, Maryland across the Appalachian Mountains to Uniontown, Pennsylvania and Washington, Pennsylvania then Wheeling and points westward. The road reached Wheeling (upstream from Elizabethtown) in 1818, and in 1830 Congress authorized rebuilding and improvement of the road using macadam. This led to the establishment of taverns and inns, including in Marshall County, although Wheeling (at the end of the Ohio River narrows as well as where the National Road crossed the Ohio River) would become the only city developed in Ohio County in this era. The National Road received additional impetus when the Wheeling Suspension Bridge across the Ohio River was completed in 1848, although by this time railroad and steamboat technology had improved and superseded the roadway.

The Virginia General Assembly created Marshall County from part of Ohio County on March 12, 1835, the same year Congress gave the National Road (and its maintenance responsibilities) to the states. It was named in honor of John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, who died that year. Its local government was organized in June, with its county seat at Elizabethtown. Jacob Burley, Benjamin McMechen, John Parriott, Samuel Howard and Zadock Masters became the new county&#x27;s first Justices of the Peace, and Elbert H. Caldwell was selected as first Commonwealth attorney. The first courthouse was finished the following year, and replaced in 1875. The building was the seat of county government, and underwent major renovations in 1974.

Agriculture was the main industry during the first decades of Marshall County history, but trade continued along the Ohio River and the National Road. Early businesses included the River Shore Flour Mill (1832) and the Mound City Flour Mill (1845). Marshall County&#x27;s first newspaper began printing in Elizabethtown in 1831.

An iron forge was established at Benwood near the Ohio river and Wheeling/Ohio County border in 1850, and that industrial area would develop following the Civil War. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad reached the Ohio River when two construction crews met at Rosbys Rock in Marshall County about five miles from Moundsville on December 24, 1852. In 1857, the railroad first crossed the Ohio river downstream, near Parkersburg. Although both towns and the railroad proposed a bridge linking Benwood and Bellaire, Ohio long before, litigation by the pre-existing ferry company as well as the Civil War discussed below, meant the bridge was not completed until 1870, although refurbished, the B &amp; O Railroad Viaduct remains in use today and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

===Civil War===
The Civil War divided Marshall County. Western Virginian Southern Unionists collected in the Wheeling Convention after the Virginia Secession Convention of April 1861. Jacob Burley&#x27;s son, a farmer and Whig who also served as sheriff and then local Justice of the Peace since 1850, James Burley had been easily elected as Marshall County&#x27;s delegate at the Secession Convention. His father-in-law was Bushrod W. Price, who had served as delegate in the Virginia General Assembly. Burley voted against secession during both votes, which caused the secessionists to expel him from that convention, but he later won election to the West Virginia Senate in 1863 and 1867. Marshall County&#x27;s delegates to the Wheeling Convention included Remembrance Swan (whose son Remembrance M. Swan would fight for the Union as an Iowa volunteer), C. H. Caldwell and Robert Morris. Ultimately, the Wheeling Convention process led to the creation of the State of West Virginia in 1863.

Meanwhile, James M. Hoge, who had briefly been Elbert Caldwell&#x27;s successor as the Marshall County commonwealth attorney, but who moved downriver and owned slaves in Putnam County (which sent no delegates to the Wheeling Convention) was elected by Marshall County Confederate troops as Marshall County&#x27;s delegate in the Virginia General Assembly.

Marshall was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia, at the height of the war on June 20, 1863. Later that year, the counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and the townships would be converted into magisterial districts in 1872. Marshall County was initially divided into nine townships: Cameron, Clay, Franklin, Liberty, Meade, Sand Hill, Union, Washington, and Webster.

===Postwar===
In 1866, after prisoners escaped from local jails, West Virginia&#x27;s legislature authorized the purchase of land in Moundsville for the new state&#x27;s penitentiary. The wooden structure was replaced by a gothic-style stone and brick building (West Virginia Penitentiary now operated as a tourist attraction), probably modeled upon a facility opened in 1858 in Joliet, Illinois. It remained West Virginia&#x27;s maximum security penitentiary from 1876 until 1995 (with a section for female inmates until construction of a separate facility in the 1940s). A more modern set of buildings at the town&#x27;s outskirts is now the northern regional jail. The Marshall County courthouse was rebuilt in 1876.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had dealt with flooding on the Ohio River as interference to navigation long before the American Civil War, and in 1870 adopted a plan for construction of 13 locks and dams between Pittsburgh and Wheeling, and a few years later Congress authorized funding of a new prototype with adjustable gates near Pittsburgh to secure a 6-foot water flow. As the 20th century began, a series of appropriations funded 18 locks and dams, finally finished in 1929. These were built for flood control, and the canals of 9-foot depth between them facilitated transportation of heavy raw materials (including coal and iron ore) and finished goods (including steel). The McMechen Lockmaster Houses on the Ohio River (built in Marshall County in 1911) are among the few that remain (and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1992).

In 1872, Marshall County&#x27;s nine townships were converted into magisterial districts. Their names and boundaries remained largely unchanged, with only minor adjustments over the next century. In the 1970s, Marshall&#x27;s nine historic districts were consolidated into three new magisterial districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.

In the late 19th century, several industries, including manufacturers of brooms, buggy whips, bricks, building supplies, steel and glassware developed in Marshall County. In 1892, the Fostoria Glass Company began producing quality tableware in Moundsville (the plant closed in 1986), and in 1901 the United States Stamping Company began producing enameled cooking ware. In the former sheep-farming community of Glen Dale, Wheeling Metal and Manufacturing Company opened a plant in 1904. Industries which developed locally in the early 20th century included: paper box manufacturing, building materials, pottery, well-drilling tools, women&#x27;s clothing, guns, and chemicals (in World War II). Most of the buildings in the Moundsville Commercial Historic District date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On April 28, 1924, a mine in Benwood that supplied Wheeling Steel experienced the then-worst mining disaster in West Virginia history, killing an entire shift (119 men; now the state&#x27;s third worst mining disaster). Between the 1890s and 1941, Benwood, McMechen, and Moundsville were connected by an electric railway. Coal mining remains important in Marshall County, with two mines producing 9.1 million tons of coal in 2009.

In 1924, Marshall County elected the first woman to serve as a West Virginia legislator, Dr. Harriet B. Jones. On August 4, 1927, Charles Lindbergh landed near Moundsville, and by the decade&#x27;s end the Fokker Aircraft Company established a plant, which became a major employer in the area, and in 1934 was transformed into a toy factory (which closed in 1980). Part of northern Marshall County is now within the city of Wheeling.

In 1968, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada established New Vrindaban near the historic village of Limestone. In 1972, his followers built Prabhupada&#x27;s Palace of Gold. Both have now become tourist attractions, although New Vrindaban also operates a substantial farm.

==Geography==

<text>Marion County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 56,205. Its county seat is Fairmont. The county was named in honor of General Francis Marion (&quot;ca.&quot; 1732–1795), known to history as &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;. Marion County comprises the Fairmont, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Morgantown–Fairmont, WV Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The Adena and successor Hopewell cultures flourished in this area at one time. The region which includes the land now known as Marion County was sparsely occupied by Native Americans, if at all, in the late 18th century. Like much of the Ohio Valley, it had been depopulated by the Iroquois during the later Beaver Wars (1670–1700). Only a few abortive attempts to start European settlements upon the Monongahela River or its branches (such as that which gave its name to Dunkard Creek) are known prior to the French and Indian War. It was not until 1772 that any permanent settlements were made in this region.

Marion County was created by an act of the Virginia Assembly on January 14, 1842, from parts of Monongalia and Harrison Counties. It was named after General Francis Marion, of American Revolutionary War fame, known to history as &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;.

1852 was an eventful time in Marion County&#x27;s history, starting with the great flood on Monday, April 5. Heavy rains the day before caused the Monongahela and West Fork Rivers to rise at rate of 5 feet per hour until Tuesday afternoon, when the water reached 43 feet above its normal level. The greatest damage was sustained on the West Fork, where over 40 houses and buildings were swept away and floated past Fairmont.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunnington 1880 https://archive.org/details/historyprogresso00dunn/page/87 87–92&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood damaged the railroad, which was in the final stages of being completed. By June 23 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was completed, connecting Fairmont to the west and to large cities in the east like Baltimore. The railroad required the building of a bridge to cross the Monongahela River about 1 mile west of Fairmont. This was achieved by building a massive iron bridge spanning 650 feet and lifted 35 feet above the water.

The third major event of the year 1852 was the completion of the Fairmont and Palatine suspension bridge, connecting Fairmont to what was then the town of Palatine. The bridge was built under the direction of James L. Randolph, assistant engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, at a cost of about thirty thousand dollars.

Marion was one of fifty Virginia counties that were admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. In the months that followed, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Marion County was divided into seven districts: Fairmont, Grant, Lincoln, Mannington, Paw Paw, Union, and Winfield. In the 1980s, the historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: Middletown, Palatine, and West Augusta.

From 1932 to 2008, the county only voted Republican in a presidential election once: for Richard Nixon in 1972 amidst a national landslide. However, like the rest of West Virginia, Marion County has trended heavily Republican in the 21st century, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than most of the state. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney flipped the county for the first time since Nixon&#x27;s victory, and it has voted Republican in each election since. In 2016 and 2020, Republican Donald Trump carried Marion County with more than 60% of the vote, with both performances the best ever for any Republican in the county.

==Literary presence==
In the &quot;1632&quot; series of science fiction novels, the fictional town of Grantville (closely modelled after real-life Mannington) and its environs were part of Marion County until the alien-caused space-time anomaly which sent it to 17th-century Thuringia. The county and its institutions are frequently mentioned in the course of the series, and writers interested in the series have held a number of &quot;mini-cons&quot; (miniature science fiction conventions) in Mannington. Flint has stated, &quot;The town of Grantville is very closely modeled on the actual town of Mannington. There are rules that I require everyone to follow when they write in the series. One of them is that it if it wasn’t in the town of Mannington in 2000, you can’t have it in Grantville. The one cheat I had to do was that I needed a power plant. The power plant is about 15 miles away, in a town called Granttown, so I just sorta moved it over. That’s the only real cheat.”

<text>Logan County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 32,567. Its county seat is Logan. Logan County comprises the Logan, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston–Huntington–Ashland, WV–OH–KY Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Logan County was formed in 1824 from parts of Giles, Tazewell, Cabell, and Kanawha counties, then part of the state of Virginia. It is named for Chief Logan, famous Native American chief of the Mingo tribe. Logan was one of fifty Virginia counties that became part of the new state of West Virginia in 1863, by an executive order of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, even though Logan County had voted for secession in the April 4, 1861, convention.

Within months of its admission to the Union, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Logan County was divided into five districts: Chapmanville, Hardee, Logan, Magnolia, and Triadelphia. A sixth district, Lee, was formed in 1878 from portions of Hardy and Magnolia Districts. In 1895, Mingo County was formed from Hardee, Lee, and Magnolia Districts, along with portions of Chapmanville and Triadelphia Districts.

In the 1960s, Chapmanville District was discontinued, and two new districts, Guyan and Island Creek, formed from its territory, along with portions of Logan and Triadelphia Districts. The county was redistricted again in the 1980s, resulting in nine magisterial districts: Buffalo, Chapmanville, East, Guyan, Island Creek, Logan, Northwest, Triadelphia, and West. However, in the following decade these were consolidated into three districts: Central, Eastern, and Western.

In 1921 it was the location of the Battle of Blair Mountain, one of the largest armed uprisings in U.S. history. More recently, the Buffalo Creek Flood of February 26, 1972, killed 125 people when a coal slurry dam burst under the pressure of heavy rains, releasing over of waste and water in a wave onto the valley below. The communities of Lorado and Lundale were destroyed and 14 other communities heavily damaged, including Saunders, Amherstdale, Crites, and Latrobe.

==Politics==
Logan County, being historically secessionist and between the New Deal and the 1990s heavily unionized, was once powerfully Democratic. Before the 2008 presidential election, the only Republican to carry the county had been Herbert Hoover in 1928, due to strong anti-Catholicism against Al Smith in this &quot;Bible Belt&quot; region. Logan was the only county in West Virginia to be carried by George McGovern in his lackluster 1972 campaign, and between 1976 and 2000 no Republican reached 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. 

From 2000 to 2016, the county swung more Republican in each consecutive election, due to the Democratic Party&#x27;s support for environmentalist policies. Democratic vote shares since 2016 have plummeted to levels historically more typical of unionist, traditionally Republican counties like Grant.

<text>Lincoln County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,463. Its county seat is Hamlin. The county was created in 1867 and named for Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln County is part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Lincoln County was created by an act of the West Virginia Legislature on February 23, 1867, from parts of Boone, Cabell, Kanawha and Putnam counties. By 1869, the county had returned much of its Putnam County territory and absorbed the northern portion of Logan County and a portion of Wayne County. In 1869, Harts Creek Township (later district) was created from this latter region. Lincoln County is one of five counties created by West Virginia since the Civil War. Hamlin, seat of government for the county, was established in 1853.

Jesse, John, David, William, and Moses McComas were the first Anglo settlers in what is now Lincoln County. They cultivated of corn, the first ever grown in the area near present-day West Hamlin, in 1799. Later that year, they returned to eastern Virginia to get their families. Their families were initially left behind because it was not known if there were any hostile Native Americans in the area, or if the soil would be suitable for cultivation. John Lucas, William Hinch, and John Johnson soon joined the McComases in the county. They built cabins in the county around 1800. About 1804, William Wirt Brumfield settled at the mouth of Big Ugly Creek.

Based on military enlistments, Lincoln County appears to have been evenly divided in its sympathies during the Civil War. The county hosted a handful of small skirmishes, mostly centered on Mud River.

After the war, timbering constituted the county&#x27;s primary industry. The county also became nationally known for its tobacco cultivation. In the early twentieth century, the county experienced a gas boom.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Between its formation in 1867 and 1870, Lincoln County was divided into seven townships: Carroll, Duval, Harts Creek, Jefferson, Sheridan, Union, and Washington. In 1871, Laurel Hill Township was formed from portions of Harts Creek and Sheridan Townships. The following year, the eight townships became magisterial districts. Except for minor adjustments, the eight historic magisterial districts remained largely unchanged until the twenty-first century, when they were consolidated into three new districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.

This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Lewis County was initially divided into five townships: Battelle, Jane Lew, Lincoln, Sheridan, and Willey. Between 1870 and &#x27;80, these were renamed &quot;Collins Settlement&quot;, &quot;Court House&quot;, &quot;Freemans Creek&quot;, &quot;Hackers Creek&quot;, and &quot;Skin Creek&quot;. In the 1990s, Collins Settlement and Court House Districts were consolidated into one district, known as &quot;Courthouse-Collins Settlement&quot;; Hackers Creek and Skin Creek were also consolidated, forming &quot;Hackers Creek-Skin Creek&quot;.

<text>Kanawha County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 180,745, making it West Virginia&#x27;s most populous county. The county seat is Charleston, which is also the state capital and most populous city.
Kanawha County is part of the Charleston, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The county began taking formation on November 14, 1788, under the authorization of the Virginia General Assembly and was founded on October 5, 1789. The county was named for the Kanawha River, which in turn was named after a Native American tribe that lived in the area. During the American Civil War, a number of state infantry and cavalry regiments were organized in the county for both Confederate Army and Union Army service.

In 1863 West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Kanawha County was divided into ten districts: Big Sandy, Cabin Creek, Charleston, Elk, Jefferson, Loudon, Malden, Poca, Union, and Washington. In the 1970s the historic districts were consolidated into five new magisterial districts: District 1, District 2, District 3, District 4, and District 5. A District 6 was created in the 1980s, but in the 1990s the county was redistricted again, reducing the number of magisterial districts to four: District 1, District 2, District 3, and District 4.

Kanawha County was the site of a bloody miners&#x27; strike in 1912, and a school textbook controversy in 1974, that resulted in bombings, and received national attention.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is the fourth-largest county in West Virginia by area.

Since 2004 it has been won by Republicans in presidential elections, although, as an urban county, the swing to the Republicans has not been as vast as in much of the rest of the state. The county seat and state capital of Charleston is heavily Democratic.
