<text>Jefferson County is the easternmost county in the U.S. State of West Virginia. It is located in the Shenandoah Valley in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 57,701. Its county seat is Charles Town. The county was founded in 1801, and today is part of the Washington metropolitan area.

==History==
===Formation===
Jefferson County was established on October 26, 1801 from Berkeley County because the citizens of southeastern Berkeley County felt they had to travel too far to the county seat of Martinsburg. Charles Washington, the founder of Charles Town and brother to George Washington, petitioned for a new county to be formed. It was named for Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States. Virginia previously had a Jefferson County, which is now part of Kentucky. Accordingly, in the State records of Virginia, there are listings for Jefferson County from 1780 to 1792 and Jefferson County from 1801 to 1863, neither of which are still in Virginia.

===John Brown rebellion===

The county&#x27;s courthouse was the site of the trial for the abolitionist John Brown after his October 1859 raid on the federal armory in Harpers Ferry. Some 90 U.S. Marines serving under then Army Colonel Robert E. Lee and Lieutenants J.E.B. Stuart and Israel Greene put down the rebellion.

Brown was sentenced to death for murder, treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, and conspiring with slaves to rebel. On December 2, 1859, John Brown was taken from the Charles Town jail a short distance to an open field and hanged. Among those attending the Brown execution was a contingent of 1500 cadets from Virginia Military Institute sent by the Governor of Virginia Henry A. Wise under the supervision of Major William Gilham and Major Thomas J. Jackson. In the ranks of a Richmond militia company stood John Wilkes Booth. Walt Whitman was also present.

===Civil War===
The county was a frequent site of conflict during the Civil War, as Union and Confederate lines moved back and forth along the Shenandoah Valley. Some towns in the county changed hands between the Union and Confederacy over a dozen times, including Charles Town, and especially Harpers Ferry.

Jefferson County is the only part of modern-day West Virginia not exempted from the effects of the Emancipation Proclamation (as Berkeley County and the 48 counties designated as West Virginia had been). Slaves in the county thus were legally free as of January 1, 1863.

The Jefferson County Courthouse is the only courthouse in America to have held two treason trials: the trial of John Brown in 1859 and a trial arising from the Battle of Blair Mountain labor rebellion.

===Joining West Virginia===

Jefferson County had voted for secession in the vote taken on May 23, 1861. However, Jefferson County, along with Berkeley County, both counties lying on the Potomac River in the Shenandoah Valley, with the consent of the Reorganized Government of Virginia voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia in 1863. Virginia tried to nullify this after the American Civil War, but the counties remained part of West Virginia.

The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in the following manner: Berkeley and Jefferson County, West Virginia, counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the Reorganized Government of Virginia, had supposedly voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia. However, many voters were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and they refused to accept the transfer upon their return. The Virginia General Assembly repealed the Act of Secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia, asking the Supreme Court to declare the counties still part of Virginia. Congress, on March 10, 1866, passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer. In 1871, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Virginia v. West Virginia&quot;, upholding the &quot;secession&quot; of West Virginia, including Berkeley and Jefferson counties, from Virginia. In 2011, West Virginia state delegate Larry Kump sponsored legislation to allow Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson counties to rejoin Virginia by popular vote.

===County subdivisions===
In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Jefferson County was initially divided into five townships, which became magisterial districts in 1872: Averill, Bolivar, Chapline, Grant, and Shepherd. In 1873, Averill District was renamed &quot;Middleway&quot;, Chapline became &quot;Potomac&quot;, and Grant District became &quot;Charlestown&quot;. Two additional districts, Harpers Ferry and Osburn, were created during the 1870s. In the 1880s, Bolivar District was annexed by Harpers Ferry; Potomac and Shepherd were consolidated into Shepherdstown District, and Osburn was renamed &quot;Kabletown&quot;.

===Rural Free Delivery===
In October 1896, Jefferson County became the first county in the United States to begin Rural Free Delivery service in the towns of Halltown and Uvilla.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is the only West Virginia county where the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah River can be found, as referenced in West Virginia&#x27;s state song, &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; by John Denver. The lowest point in the state of West Virginia is located on the Potomac River (just east of Harpers Ferry) in Jefferson County, where it flows out of West Virginia and into Virginia.

==Government==
===Law enforcement===
The Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Department provides law enforcement services in the county, and handles all 911 emergency and non emergency calls. In February 2007, Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Department Corporal Ronald Fletcher was shot and critically wounded during a stand-off at the residence of the girlfriend of a suspect, Dorsey Cox. Cox had been at his girlfriend&#x27;s house retrieving personal items in violation of a court-ordered protective order. As Corporal Fletcher approached the house, Cox fled inside and subsequently shot Corporal Fletcher four times, one of which struck the officer in the chest. The State Police&#x27;s SWAT team entered the house. Cox was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

On June 5, 2012, Sheriff Robert Shirley was indicted on one count of deprivation of rights under color of law and one count of destruction, falsification or alteration of a record in a federal investigation. He is alleged to have beaten Mark Daniel Haines, who later pleaded guilty to bank robbery, during his arrest on December 27, 2010. He is also alleged to have altered a use of force report while the incident was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Shirley and 14 other &quot;John Doe&quot; law enforcement officers were also the subject of a civil rights lawsuit filed by Haines. The lawsuit alleges that Shirley and the other officers used excessive force while arresting Haines. Shirley pled guilty to federal civil rights charges of and was sentenced to a year in prison.

===Politics===
Jefferson County has been a Republican-leaning county in the 21st century, although Barack Obama carried it in the 2008 presidential election. The county is part of the Washington metropolitan area, making it less heavily Republican than most counties in West Virginia. 

For much of the 20th century, the county trended strongly Democratic due to historical sympathies for Confederate Virginia. In contrast to its rock-ribbed Unionist and Republican Eastern Panhandle sister Morgan County, Jefferson did not vote Republican until Dwight D. Eisenhower won by 27 votes in 1956, and afterwards voted Republican only in the 1972 and 1984 landslides, and in 1988. 

Despite its strong support for Republican presidential candidates in recent years, local Democrats still have success in Jefferson County. Even as recently as 2018, Senator Joe Manchin won the county in his successful reelection, despite the county being the home of his opponent, Patrick Morrisey.

<text>Jackson County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 27,791. Its county seat is Ripley, and its largest municipality is Ravenswood.

==History==
In 1674, frontiersman Gabriel Arthur visited a large Native American village, probably the first white person to reach the area. French traders visited by 1796 and British traders by 1703. In 1749, Celeron De Blainville and his party traveling on the Ohio River left lead plates claiming the area for France. Baltimore-born explorer Christopher Gist visited the following year.

In 1770, when the area was still part of the Colony of Virginia, George Washington, his friend Dr. James Craik, and Col. William Crawford surveyed what eventually became Jackson County, staying on their return from Fort Pitt along Sand Creek at an Iroquois village led by Keoshuta and later at his hunting camp (which later became Ravenswood). Washington patented land claims in that area in 1793. and other land was deeded to Albert Gallatin. The future Ravenswood site was acquired by Sallie Ashton, wife of Alexandria, Virginia judge Nicholas Fitzhugh, and purchased from other heirs by Henry Fitzhugh, who moved to and developed the area, including building a saw and gristmill. The first (private) school in the county was opened in Cottageville in 1807, the second school at Murrayville in 1818, followed by a school at Ripley in 1829 and one at Ravenswood in 1839. Hunter and Indian fighter Jesse Hughes (1750-1829) settled in Jackson County, but he and his wife were evicted in their old age for failing to properly secure the title for the farm on which they had lived for decades.

===Incorporation and splits===
Two years later (in 1831) citizens petitioned for incorporating the county, which was formed from sections of Kanawha, Wood, and Mason Counties, and named for Andrew Jackson, seventh President of the United States.

Ripley, on Big Mill Creek about 12 miles from its confluence with the Ohio River and the location of a bridge on the West Columbia Pike as well as both a sawmill and a flour and grist mill (which also had a carding machine to make wool yarn), was laid out in 1832 and became the county seat; the courthouse was completed by October 1833, although it was not incorporated until 1852 (and re-incorporated in 1867). Ravenswood, about 12 miles further up Big Mill Creek, would be platted the next year by Henry Fitzhugh. Bartholomew Fleming began operating a ferry at Ravenswood in 1840, and a wagon road between Ravenswood and Spencer (which later became Roane County&#x27;s seat) was completed in the early 1840s. However, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad would not reach Ravenswood and Spencer (on the Wheeling to Huntington line) until 1886. Jackson County&#x27;s population in 1840 was 4,890.

Increased settlement led to the formation of two additional counties from parts of what had been Jackson County. In 1848, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the creation of Wirt County from inland portions of Jackson and Wood Counties. In 1856, the Virginia General Assembly created Roane County from Jackson County.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, the county was divided, but tilted toward the Union, and suffered from raids and bushwackers. At the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, its joint delegate with upstream Roane County, lawyer Franklin P. Turner, twice voted for secession after rival meetings held by pro- and anti-secession forces in Jackson County on April 8, 1861. Jackson County sent several delegates to the Wheeling Convention, but Roane County sent none. Daniel E. Frost of Ravenswood, editor of the county&#x27;s first newspaper and who had represented both counties in the Virginia House of Delegates, became the delegate for both counties. Fellow delegates also elected him the Speaker of the Restored Government&#x27;s General Assembly held at Wheeling in 1861 and 1862 (which prepared for West Virginia statehood). Col. Frost would die fighting for the Union in 1863. Henrietta Fitzhugh Barre, the daughter of Henry Fitzhugh, sympathized with the Confederacy and kept a diary, first published in 1961. Another former delegate George B. Crow of Angerona (a silver boom town) would enlist as a Confederate and also reach the rank of colonel, but he survived the war. Confederate raiders attacked Ravenswood and Ripley in May and September 1862, and again in May 1863.

In July 1863, the Battle of Buffington Island near Ravenswood became the only naval action in West Virginia. The 9th West Virginia supported the tinclad and ironclad naval vessels, and they and Union forces across the Ohio River captured 1700 Confederates and set the stage for the capture of CSA Major General John Hunt Morgan and ended his raids.

When West Virginia became a state in 1863, its counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Jackson county was divided into five townships: Gilmore, Grant, Hushan&#x27;s Mills, Mill Creek, and Washington. All white males who owned at least a house and 12 square feet of land were granted the right to vote. Hushan&#x27;s Mills, including the area around Cottageville, was subsequently renamed &quot;Union&quot;. In 1871, Gilmore Township was renamed &quot;Ravenswood&quot;, and Mill Creek became &quot;Ripley&quot;, after the county&#x27;s two chief towns. All five townships became magisterial districts in 1872. They remained stable for over a hundred years, until in the 1990s they were consolidated into three new districts: Eastern, Northern, and Western.

===Postwar development===
Many former Virginians from the Clinch River Valley in southwest Virginia settled in the area by 1877, so the Bruen Lands Feud (also known as the Roane County Land Wars, which began with the death of a War of 1812 veteran circa 1845, leaving heirs in New York State, and was the subject of the 1864 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Harvey v. Tyler) reached Jackson county and led to several murders. The brother of a murdered U.S. Deputy Marshall published an account.

Timbering and oil and gas operations caused Jackson County&#x27;s population to rise to 19,000 in 1900; it had the 6th largest area of cultivatable land of all West Virginia counties (divided mainly into small farms, hence by 1997 it also had the second largest number of farms in West Virginia).
Kaiser Aluminum built a smelting and manufacturing complex beginning in 1954 that became a major employer in Jackson county. It changed hands several times after 1988 and experienced a major strike in the 1990s. The aluminum plant closed in 2015, although the rolling mill (under separate ownership since 2003 and which also changed ownership several times) still operates.

The Cedar Lakes Conference Center was also established circa 1954 and still operates (now through the U.S. Department of Agriculture), as does a Baptist conference center serving approximately 700 churches. The Jackson County Maritime and Industrial Complex encompasses 159 acres, including 25 acres devoted to barge loading and unloading.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (1.5%) is water. The Ohio River forms part of Jackson County&#x27;s western border. Sandy Creek and Mill Creek, tributaries of the Ohio, flow through the county&#x27;s northern and central portions.

==Politics==
Although its neighbour Roane County voted for secession on its behalf during the Virginia Secession Convention, Jackson County is believed to have had a Unionist majority when the Civil War broke out. This contention is supported by it being a historically Republican-leaning county, though much less so than the rock-ribbed Unionist trio of Ritchie, Doddridge and Tyler Counties to its northeast. The only Democrats to win the county since the Civil War have been Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, Woodrow Wilson in 1912, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

<text>Harrison County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,921, making it West Virginia&#x27;s 7th most populous county. Its county seat is Clarksburg. Harrison County is part of the Clarksburg, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The land that is now Harrison Country has a long history. Indigenous peoples have lived in the area that would become Harrison County for thousands of years. In fact, the Oak Mounds outside of Clarksburg were built by the Hopewell culture mound builders during the first millennium CE. 

===18th century===
White trappers visited the area that is now Harrison County as early as the 1760s. Some traded with the Native Americans there. The Virginia Colony claimed the area as part of its vast Augusta County. The first permanent settler in the area was hunter and trapper John Simpson, who erected a cabin at the mouth of Elk Creek on the West Fork River in 1763 or &#x27;64. Simpson&#x27;s name remains on &quot;Simpson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (its mouth is about 9 miles downstream from present Clarksburg). Settler Daniel Davisson (1748–1819), from New Jersey, claimed the land upon which present-day Clarksburg, Harrison County, was formed in 1773; the area was re-designated as part of Monongalia County, Virginia three years later. Simpson&#x27;s story did not end well. According to a 19th-century local historian, he ...

... continued to hunt and trap for a year without encountering any other human being. In 1765, he went to the South Branch to dispose of a stock of skins and furs, and returning to his camp, remained until permanent settlements were made in the vicinity. ... Simpson&#x27;s cabin was located about one mile from Clarksburg, on the west side of the West Fork River ... Simpson became indebted to a man named Cottrial to the amount of &quot;one quart of salt&quot; (a precious article at the time), which he agreed to pay, either in money or salt, upon his return from Winchester, whither he was going to dispose of a stock of skins and furs. Upon his return, a dispute arose between them, regarding the payment, and Cottrial, in the heat of passion, hastened from the house, and grasping Daniel Davisson&#x27;s gun, which stood leaning against the cabin, took aim through the space between the logs, and attempted to shoot Simpson. The latter, however, was too quick for him, and springing outside, grasped the gun from Cottrial&#x27;s hands and killed him. This was the first tragedy of this nature in the vicinity.

Harrison County was organized in 1784 with territory partitioned from Monongalia County. It was named after Benjamin Harrison V, who had recently retired as the Governor of Virginia. He was the father of William Henry Harrison, the 9th President of the United States and great-grandfather of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States. Over the next 72 years, eight present-day West Virginia counties and parts of ten others were formed from this original Harrison County.

The first meeting of the Harrison County court was held on July 20, 1784, at the home of George Jackson. The group designated the county seat as Clarksburg. The town, named for explorer General George Rogers Clark (1752–1818), was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in October 1785, and it was incorporated in 1795.

===19th century===
Clarksburg&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The By-Stander&quot;, began publication in 1810. Construction of the Northwestern Turnpike, connecting Winchester and Parkersburg, reached the town in 1836, stimulating development by connecting it to other markets. Clarksburg&#x27;s economic development was also helped by the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1856. The railroad was instrumental to the development of the local coal mining industry during the late 1800s and early 1900s.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Harrison County was divided into ten districts: Clark, Clay, Coal, Eagle, Elk, Grant, Sardis, Simpson, Tenmile, and Union. These districts remained stable for a century, but in the 1970s they were consolidated to form six new districts: North Clarksburg, South Clarksburg, Suburban, Northern, Southeast, and Southwest. In the 1980s, North and South Clarksburg districts became North Urban and South Urban. In the 1990s, the Southeast and Suburban districts were discontinued, and replaced by the Eastern and Southern districts.

==Geography==
The county terrain consists of low rolling hills, is largely wooded, and etched by drainages and creeks. The terrain slopes to the West Fork River valley from both the east and west borders, and also generally slopes to the north. Its highest point is on the south corner at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water. The county is drained by the north-flowing West Fork River and its tributaries, including Tenmile Creek, Simpson Creek, and Elk Creek.

<text>Hardy County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,299. Its county seat is Moorefield. The county was created from Hampshire County in 1786 and named for Samuel Hardy, a distinguished Virginian.

==History==
The first European known to visit this area was John Van Meter in 1725. The earliest permanent European settlements were established in the 1730s.

Hardy County was formed in 1786 from Hampshire County in Virginia. It was one of fifty counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia in 1863.

That year, the newly independent state&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Hardy County was divided into three districts: Capon, Lost River, and Moorefield. A fourth district, South Fork, was formed in 1873 from part of Moorefield District, and a fifth district, Old Fields, was created in the 1980s.

Hardy County has a rich African American history, with many free African Americans living there before the Civil War. This history is discussed in part 2 of the Henry Louis Gates television series &quot;African American Lives&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.

Through this county flows the South Branch Potomac River with its surrounding magnificent valley. Several miles wide, &quot;the Valley,&quot; as it is commonly called, contains lands whose fertility lends itself to successful farming. Agriculture and stock raising have always been the main source of employment in this area, with corn, wheat, apples, peaches, melons, cattle and poultry having important interests. Truck-farming has a vital role, each household possessing its own small garden.

On either side of the Valley are high mountains with rough terrain and heavy timber. Throughout the area wildlife is plentiful, and hunting has always been a major diversion and source of meat supply.

The South Branch is a clear stream, quite wide, and of considerable depth in many places. Watering the Valley, the river abounds in fish and creates many picturesque settings. At times the usually calm waters surge from low banks and spread over the Valley, enveloping and ravishing the rich surrounding lands. The river has a peculiar feature in the field of geology as it flows through the Valley. At one point the river, thousands of years ago, did not cut across the mountains from one side to the other, but made a passage through them from end to end. This geological exception is now in the form of a narrow, trough-like gap, about long, and appropriately called &quot;The Trough&quot;. At the present day, the gorge is several hundred feet deep, and the South Branch flows in a narrow channel at the bottom, with almost perpendicular walls of rock on either side.

In the very center of the South Branch Valley, surrounded by high mountains, and located on the east side of the junction of the South Fork South Branch Potomac River and the South Branch Potomac, is Moorefield, the county seat of Hardy County. A quiet farming center in 1860, the population of the Moorefield area at that time was about 1,500. At this period there were no bridges at Moorefield, and the South Branch had to be forded some up the Valley, or the ferryboat, which was usually busy, had to be used. The main towns that communicated with Moorefield were Petersburg, Romney, and New Creek (presently Keyser) the latter having a stage line between the two points.

==Politics==
During the Virginia Secession Convention, Hardy County voted against secession from the United States, but much of this vote was within fiercely Unionist and overwhelmingly Republican Grant County, which was detached from it after the war. Following the detachment of Grant – which was frequently to be among the nation&#x27;s most Republican counties in the subsequent century and a half – Hardy County became solidly Democratic, not voting for any Republican candidate between 1868 and 1964 inclusive. However, since 1968, Hardy County has voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election with the exceptions of Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1996. Since 2000, it has seen the same significant increase in Republican support as the rest of socially conservative West Virginia.

<text>Hancock County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 29,095. Its county seat is New Cumberland and its largest city is Weirton. The county was created from Brooke County in 1848 and named for John Hancock, first signer of the Declaration of Independence. Located at the tip of the state&#x27;s Northern Panhandle, Hancock County is the northernmost point in both West Virginia and, by some definitions, the Southern United States. Hancock County is part of the Weirton-Steubenville, WV-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-WV-OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Hancock County was formed from Brooke County in 1848, some 15 years before West Virginia became a state. Both counties were once part of Ohio County, Virginia, which had been formed from the District of West Augusta in 1776. Hancock County has significant Revolutionary-period roots due to its location on the Ohio River south of Fort Pitt in Pittsburgh and north of Fort Henry in Wheeling.

Hancock County was the site of the infamous massacre of Iroquois leader Chief Logan&#x27;s family in 1774, at Baker&#x27;s Tavern across the Ohio River from the mouth of Yellow Creek. The event, known as the Yellow Creek massacre, sparked Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. Adam Poe had his famous fight with the Indian known as Big Foot at the mouth of Tomlinson Run in 1781. Historical markers commemorate both events. Significant Revolutionary War forts and blockhouses in Hancock County included Holliday&#x27;s Cove Fort in downtown Weirton and Chapman&#x27;s Blockhouse in New Cumberland.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Hancock County was divided into four districts: Butler, Clay, Grant, and Poe. Poe, the least populous district, was discontinued in the 1920s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.1%) is water. It is the smallest county in West Virginia by area, as well as one of the smallest in the United States. The highest point of elevation in Hancock County is approximately 1363 ft. and located about 1800 ft. ESE of Emmanuel Mission Church.

==Government==
Hancock County is governed by a three-member County Commission who each serve in rotating six-year terms. The terms are designed such that one seat is up for election in even years. The County Commission annually chooses its own president. The Hancock County Commissioners in 2024 are Paul Cowey, Jeff Davis and Eron Chek.

In the West Virginia Circuit Courts, Hancock County is part of the First Family Court Circuit of West Virginia, which also includes Brooke and Ohio Counties. In West Virginia, Family Court Judges were first elected to six-year terms beginning in 2002 and were elected to eight-year terms beginning in 2008. The current judges of the First Family Court Circuit are the Hon. Joyce Chernenko and the Hon. Heather Wood. Additionally, Hancock County is part of the First Judicial Circuit of West Virginia, which again also includes Brooke and Ohio Counties. Circuit Judges are elected in non-partisan elections to eight-year terms. The current judges of the First Judicial Circuit are the Hon. Jason A. Cuomo, the Hon. Michael J. Olejasz, the Hon. David J. Sims, and the Hon. Ronald E. Wilson.

Magistrates are elected in partisan elections serving four-year terms. Vacancies occurring in unexpired terms can be filled by a respective Circuit Court Judge. Unlike Circuit Court judges or Family Court judges, magistrates are not required to be attorneys. Hancock County currently has three magistrates: Ralph A. Fletcher, Omeka D. Petteway, and Stephen Svokas.

Other elected officials are Sheriff Scott Gittings, Circuit Clerk Sandy Casto, County Clerk Karan Valenti, Assessor Joe Alongi and Prosecuting Attorney Steven E. Dragisich.

===Politics===
Abutting the free states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and with a largely German–American culture unlike any other part of antebellum Virginia, Hancock County and the rest of the Northern Panhandle were central to the vanguard who made West Virginia a new state during the Civil War. For the next six and a half decades the county, aided by its association with Pennsylvania&#x27;s powerful ironmaster-led political machines, voted solidly Republican to the point of supporting William Howard Taft during the disastrously divided 1912 election. From the New Deal until the presidency of Bill Clinton, however, powerful unionization meant that Hancock County turned from solidly Republican to solidly Democratic, with the exception of George McGovern in 1972. Like all of West Virginia, since 2000 a combination of declining unionization and growing differences with the Democratic Party on social issues has produced a swing back to the Republican Party.

<text>Hampshire County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,093. Its county seat is Romney, West Virginia&#x27;s oldest town (1762). The county was created by the Virginia General Assembly in 1754, from parts of Frederick and Augusta Counties (Virginia) and is the state&#x27;s oldest county. The county lies in West Virginia&#x27;s Potomac Highlands region.

Hampshire County is part of the Winchester, VA-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Name==
Although its creation was authorized in 1754, Hampshire County was not actually organized until 1757 because the area was not considered safe due to the outbreak of the French and Indian War (1754–1763). According to Samuel Kercheval&#x27;s &quot;A History of the Valley of Virginia&quot; (1833), the county was named in honor of its several prize hogs. The story goes that Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693–1781), who owned the Royal Grant to the area, came upon some very large hogs in Winchester and asked where they had been raised. He was told that they were from the South Branch Potomac River Valley (now Hampshire County). He remarked that when a county was formed west of Frederick that he would name it in honor of the county Hampshire, England, famous for its very fat hogs.

==History==

===Earliest European settlers===
Romney was initially settled by hunters and traders around 1725. In 1738, John Pearsall (or Pearsoll) and his brother Job built homes and in 1758 a fort (Fort Pearsall) for defense against Native Americans in present-day Romney. Their settlement was then known as Pearsall&#x27;s Flats. In 1748, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sent a surveying party, including 16-year-old George Washington, to survey his lands along the Potomac and South Branch Potomac rivers. Washington spent three summers and falls surveying Lord Fairfax&#x27;s Northern Neck estate, which included all of the present-day Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. In April 1748, he laid off several lots in an area known as the Trough, about south of Romney, and he is known to have been in present-day Romney on October 19, 1749. Oral traditions claimed that Washington laid present-day Romney out into lots at that time, but written records from that era indicate that Romney was surveyed and laid out into lots by James Genn prior to Washington&#x27;s arrival. Genn was also employed by Lord Fairfax.

===18th century Hampshire County===
In 1756, Fort Pearsall was constructed on Job Pearsall&#x27;s plantation for protection against Native American raids and George Washington provisioned and garrisoned the Fort at various times until 1758. At that time, there were at least 100 people living in the general area. Following the end of hostilities in the area, Lord Fairfax recognized that more settlers would be interested in moving into the area and that he could earn some extra revenue by selling plots in the town. He sent a survey party to Romney in 1762 to formally lay out the town into 100 lots. At that time, he renamed the town Romney, in honor of the Cinque Ports city on the English Channel in Kent.

Confusion ensued for several decades concerning land ownership within the town, as counterclaims were made by the original settlers, and those who purchased lots laid out by Lord Fairfax&#x27;s surveyors.

The first meeting of the Hampshire County Court was held in 1757, at Fort Pleasant, now Old Fields in Hardy County, and was presided by the Right Honorable Thomas Bryan Martin, Lord Fairfax&#x27;s nephew. By that time, Hampshire County&#x27;s population had fallen dramatically as most of the settlers had fled the county in fear of the Native Americans. The only families remaining lived near Fort Pearsall, near present-day Romney, and Fort Edwards, at present-day Capon Bridge on the Cacapon River. The vast majority of the remaining settlers, however, were in the vicinity of present Old Fields-Moorefield-Petersburg and were protected by the several forts in the area, including Fort Pleasant

Once the Native Americans were defeated at the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774 settlers, once again, returned to the county. Additionally, with the end of the American Revolution, the Virginia Legislature nullified the English grant to Lord Fairfax in the region. The legislature gave fee simple grants to settlers who already had contracts with Lord Fairfax, and opened up the remaining lands as public domain open to settlement. By 1790, when the first national census was taken, Hampshire County had 7,346 residents, making it the second most populous county in the present state of West Virginia at that time. Berkeley was the most populous county, with 19,713 people. There were nine counties that comprised the present state, with a total population of 55,873 people.

During the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, many Hampshire County men volunteered to serve under Major General Daniel Morgan to put down the insurrection. The men most likely volunteered at Moorefield in Hardy County and then marched north to Cumberland, Maryland. Approximately 1,200 of the 12,950 men under Morgan&#x27;s command came from the area that would later become West Virginia.

===Early churches===

Many early settlers of the Cacapon area were German Baptist Brethren (or Dunkers), pacifist farmers who often befriended local natives in frontier areas.
Other early missionaries helped to sustain the religious faith of the early European inhabitants. In 1775, two Baptist missionaries among a group of settlers moved to the Cacapon and organized the first European church in the county. In 1771, the work of the Methodist Episcopal Church was begun, in which later developments led to the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1753, Hampshire County had been formed into a parish by the Protestant Episcopal Church, and from 1772 until his death in 1777, Rev. Nathaniel Manning served on the Glebe near present-day Moorefield. In 1787, a Primitive Baptist church was established at North River. Soon after the American Revolution, there was preaching by the Presbyterians at different points in the county. In 1792, a Presbyterian church was organized at Romney and another, Mount Bethel Church, at Three Churches.

===Early industry===

The wide lowlands of Hampshire County certainly invited agriculture, and fields of wheat and tobacco surrounded the important truck-patch of the settler. The rolling uplands offered pasturage for horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, which were driven across country to market at Winchester. The streams abounded in fish and the mountains contained not only game but timber and stone for early settlers&#x27; homes. The limestone was burned for lime at Bloomery Gap, where remains of old lime-kilns give evidence of an early industry. Soon it was discovered that some of the strata contained iron ore. Much of it was transported to present-day Keyser, from an area along South Branch Potomac River south of the present limits of the county. In Bloomery Gap, a ruined furnace still stands, mute evidence of another former industry. In the early days the increasing population stimulated not only farming and grazing but every industry of a new country. Hampshire County was also known for its many gunmakers, located on or near the main road from Winchester to Romney. Among them were, Henry Topper, Jacob Kline, George Young, Benjamin Shane, George Glaze, William Britton and the Sheetz Family.

===19th century Hampshire County===

The building of the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) was an integral part of the development of Hampshire County. General Daniel Morgan first suggested the road be built in 1748, but his recommendations were not acted upon until the 1830s. Colonel Claudius Crozet, a Frenchman who had previously worked for Napoleon Bonaparte, engineered the road which connected Parkersburg with Winchester, Virginia. The turnpike traversed Hampshire County stretching through the communities of Capon Bridge, Loom, Hanging Rock, Pleasant Dale, Augusta, Frenchburg, Shanks, and Romney. Through the years, Romney became an important rest stop for travelers on the turnpike. This aided the local economy as hotels and taverns began to appear in the area.

During the American Civil War, the Hampshire Guards and Frontier Riflemen joined the Confederate Army. Although there were no major battles in Hampshire County, Romney changed hands at least fifty-six times during the war. It was often a case of one army evacuating the area allowing the opposing army to move into the town. This places Romney second behind Winchester as the town that changed hands the most during the American Civil War. On June 11, 1861, it changed hands twice in the same day. Some local Hampshire County historians speculate that Romney actually changed hands more than Winchester, but there are no surviving records to support the claim.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Between 1866, when Mineral County was formed from the western portion of Hampshire County, and 1871, when part of southern Mineral County was returned to Hampshire, the county was divided into six townships: Bloomery, Capon, Gore, Romney, Sherman, and Springfield. These became magisterial districts in 1872, and a seventh district, Mill Creek, was formed in part from the land that had been in Mineral County from 1866 to 1871.

==Politics==
During the Virginia Secession Convention, Hampshire County voted against secession, but much of this vote was within what is now part of heavily Unionist and Republican Mineral County, which was detached from it after the war. Following the detachment of Mineral – which was not to give a Democratic majority before 1936 or after 1976 – Hampshire County became solidly Democratic, not voting for any Republican candidate between 1868 and 1952 inclusive. However, since 1968 Hampshire County has not voted for any Democratic presidential candidate apart from Jimmy Carter in 1976, and since 2000 it has suffered the same drastic declines in Democratic support as the rest of socially conservative West Virginia. Donald Trump won the county by an overwhelming margin in 2016.

<text>Greenbrier County () is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 32,977. Its county seat is Lewisburg. The county was formed in 1778 from Botetourt and Montgomery counties in Virginia.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of European-American settlers around 1740, Greenbrier County, like most of West Virginia, was used as a hunting ground by the Shawnee and Cherokee nations. They called this land &quot;Can-tuc-kee&quot;.

Shawnee leaders, including Pucksinwah and later his son Tecumseh, were alarmed by the arrival of the European settlers, who by 1771 had set up extensive trade in the area. The day books of early merchants Sampson and George Mathews recorded sales to the Shawnee that included such luxury items as silk, hats, silver, and tailor-made suits. Shawnee leaders feared the loss of their hunting lands, which were vital to their survival. They believed the white settlers would continue to encroach on their territory downriver on the Ohio.

Confrontations, sometimes violent, increased between the Native Americans and settlers. In 1774, the Earl of Dunmore, then governor of the colonies of New York and Virginia, decided to raise an army of 3,000 men to attack the Shawnees in their homeland in present-day Ohio. Half of these men were inducted at Fort Pitt, while the other half assembled at Fort Union under the command of General Andrew Lewis. The town of present-day Lewisburg developed around the fort and was named for that commander. By early October of that year, Lewis&#x27; force had marched downstream to the mouth of the Kanawha River. They fought the Battle of Point Pleasant against a Shawnee force led by &quot;Hokoleskwa&quot;, also known as Cornstalk. This site later developed as the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

European settlers were subjected to a number of raids by Native Americans during the colonial period, including a raid on Fort Randolph and later on Fort Donnally, then inhabited by 25 men and 60 women and children. One of the heroic defenders of Fort Donnally was an African American slave named Dick Pointer. Pointer, said to have been nearly tall, defended the log door with Philip Hamman, giving the settlers enough time to awaken and defend themselves. Pointer later addressed the Virginia General Assembly and gave a moving appeal that &quot;in the decline of life&quot; he requested to be freed for his defense of Fort Donnally. Historic accounts differ as to whether the legislature granted his wish. His grave is marked beside Carnegie Hall in the county seat of Lewisburg, and a historical marker stands prominently in the midst of the Lewisburg Cemetery. Pointer&#x27;s gun is on permanent display at The Greenbrier Historical Society and John A. North House Museum in Lewisburg.

During the secession crisis of 1861 Greenbrier citizens chose Samuel Price as their delegate to the Richmond convention. On April 17, 1861, the day Virginia&#x27;s secession ordinance was passed he voted against it, but later changed his mind and signed the official document. When the public vote on the secession ordinance was held on May 23, 1861, Greenbrier county voted 1,000 to 100 in favor of secession. The Civil War came to the county in mid 1861, and several battles were fought in the area, including Lewisburg in May 1862 and White Sulphur Springs in August 1863. Both battles were Union victories. Greenbrier County became part of the new state of West Virginia, although it never participated in any of the votes held by the Restored Government in Wheeling. West Virginia contributed approximately 20,000 men to the Union and an equal amount to the Confederate army, with approximately 2,000 men from Greenbrier county joining the Confederate army.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Greenbrier County was initially divided into ten townships: Anthony&#x27;s Creek, Big Levels, Blue Sulphur, Falling Spring, Fort Spring, Irish Corner, Lewisburg, Meadow Bluff, White Sulphur, and Williamsburg. Lewisburg District was co-extensive with the town of Lewisburg until 1871, when Big Levels Township was divided between Lewisburg and Falling Spring Townships. The same year, Summers County was formed from parts of Greenbrier, Fayette, Mercer, and Monroe Counties. The portion of Greenbrier County that became part of Summers County belonged to Blue Sulphur Township. In 1872, the nine remaining townships became magisterial districts. A tenth district, Frankford, was created from part of Falling Spring District between 1910 and 1920. In the 1990s the ten historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: Eastern, Western, and Central.

What is claimed to be the oldest golf course in the United States was founded in 1884 just north of White Sulphur Springs by the Montague family.

The famous &quot;Greenbrier Ghost&quot; trial occurred at Sam Black Church. Zona Heaster Shue, the wife of Edward Shue, was found dead on January 23, 1897. The coroner initially listed her cause of her death as &quot;everlasting faint&quot;, then as &quot;childbirth.&quot; Shue&#x27;s mother, Mary Jane Heaster, testified in court that her daughter&#x27;s ghost had visited her on four separate occasions, claiming that her neck had been broken by her husband, who had strangled her in a fit of rage. Shue&#x27;s body was exhumed, and based on the results of an autopsy, Edward Shue was tried and convicted of murder. A historical marker located along U.S. Route 60 at Sam Black Church describes it as the &quot;[o]nly known case in which testimony from [a] ghost helped convict a murderer.&quot;

During the decade prior to World War II, several Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps were located along the Greenbrier River.

For most of the 20th century, the Meadow River Lumber Company operated the world&#x27;s largest hardwood sawmill in Rainelle.

During World War II The Greenbrier hotel was used as a military hospital. Sections were used as an internment center for Axis diplomats who were stranded in the United States during the war. When the war ended, the military returned the hotel to private control, and it re-opened as a hotel. During the years of the Cold War, a large underground bunker was built beneath a section of new construction at the hotel, to serve as a secret Congressional refuge in case of nuclear attack. It was one of the sites to be used as part of the United States Continuity of Operations Plan. After it was reported in a 1992 article, following the fall of the Soviet Union, the US government decommissioned it as a government site.

In the June 2016 floods that affected the state of West Virginia, Greenbrier County suffered 16 casualties, the most of any county.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. It is the second-largest county in West Virginia by area.

Much of the area of the northern and western parts of the county is either public (Monongahela National Forest), coal land, or private forest, owned by companies such as MeadWestvaco and CSX.

In 2005, Invenergy, LLC of Chicago Illinois announced plans to build the $300 million, 124-turbine Beech Ridge Wind Farm along the tops of several Greenbrier County mountains. The wind farm would produce 186 megawatts of electricity. Development, which was originally expected to begin in late 2007, was stalled when the state Supreme Court agreed to hear the case brought by opponents of the project. Ultimately, The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the developers, clearing the way for construction to begin in the summer of 2009. However, in July of that year, a U.S. District Court in Maryland agreed to hear a case filed by opponents.

<text>Grant County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,976. Its county seat is Petersburg. The county was created from Hardy County in 1866 and named for Civil War General and the 18th president of the United States Ulysses S. Grant.

==History==
The territory that became Grant County in 1866 was originally part of Hampshire County, the oldest county formed within the present boundaries of West Virginia, in 1754. In 1786, Hardy County was formed from the southern portion of Hampshire County. The county&#x27;s boundaries were relatively stable from 1788 until 1866, when Grant County was formed from the western portion of Hardy. The first counties formed in the state following the admission of West Virginia to the Union were Grant and Mineral in 1866, the latter formed from the western portion of Hampshire County, and thus adjoining Grant. They were the fifty-first and fifty-second counties in West Virginia, and only Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo were created after them.

Beginning in 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Between its establishment and 1870, Grant County was divided into three townships: Grant, Milroy, and Union, which became magisterial districts in 1872.

Most of the 47 people killed in the 1985 Election day floods were in Pendleton and Grant counties, according to the National Weather Service. At Franklin, the Pendleton County seat, the South Branch of the Potomac River crested at 22.6 feet during the incident. Flood stage in the shallow riverbed was only 7 feet.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

==Politics and government==
===Federal politics===
Grant County lies within West Virginia&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. The current representative of the district is Riley Moore (R).

Politically, Grant County was historically a major outlier in West Virginia. While the rest of the state did not become a Republican bastion until the 21st century after having leaned heavily Democratic between the New Deal and Bill Clinton’s presidency, Grant County has always been among the most strongly Republican counties in the country. Since Grant County was created in 1866, no Democrat has managed to receive 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote in any Presidential election. The only Republican to ever lose Grant County has been William Howard Taft in 1912 when the GOP was divided and Progressive Theodore Roosevelt claimed the majority of the county&#x27;s vote.

The county&#x27;s Republican bent has held even in national Democratic landslides. Franklin D. Roosevelt never tallied more than 26.8 percent of the vote in any of his four successful campaigns, and Lyndon B. Johnson only managed 37.8 percent in 1964. Jimmy Carter is the only other Democrat besides LBJ to have cracked the 30 percent barrier.

Notably, in 2016, 2020, and 2024, Donald Trump received the highest percentages of the vote ever cast for a presidential candidate in this county. He held Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris to 10%, 11%, and 10% of the vote, respectively.











===State politics===
At the state level, Grant County voted for popular Democratic governor Joe Manchin over his GOP opponent Russ Weeks by over 20 points in 2008.

Grant County is represented in one Senate district with two Senators in the West Virginia Senate. Senate members Senate members Jay Taylor (R) and Randy Smith (R) both serve in West Virginia&#x27;s 14th Senate district. The county is represented in the West Virginia House of Delegates by one Delegate. The Delegate for Grant County is John Paul Hott (R) for district 85.

===County government===
Grant County&#x27;s government consists the County Administrator and the County Commission. The County Administrator is the county executive that handles all administrative duties for and reports to the County Commission. The position of the Grant County Administrator is currently held by Michelle Sites.

The Grant County Commission consists of three members. The current members of the County Commission are Kevin P. Hagerty, Scotty Miley and Tyson Riggleman.

<text>Gilmer County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,408, making it West Virginia&#x27;s fifth-least populous county. Its county seat is Glenville. The county was formed in 1845 from parts of Lewis and Kanawha Counties, and named for Thomas Walker Gilmer, Governor of Virginia from 1840 to 1841. Gilmer was later a representative in the United States Congress and Secretary of the Navy in President John Tyler&#x27;s cabinet.

Cedar Creek State Park offers camping, fishing, swimming, and hiking. The West Virginia State Folk Festival is held each June. Glenville State University has a community activity center, a state-of-the-art library, and a complete collection of hand-carved, West Virginia–native birds on public display. The Gilmer County Recreation Center Complex includes a small golf course, a convention / reunion hall, and bunk houses. Gilmer County is home to ten nationally registered historic landmarks, the Cedar Creek Backway, and the annual West Virginia Folk Festival. Media outlets for the community include &quot;The Glenville Democrat&quot; and &quot;The Glenville Pathfinder&quot;, the county&#x27;s two newspapers.

Gilmer County is also the site of Federal Correctional Institution, Gilmer, a federal medium security prison for men and the county&#x27;s largest employer.

As of 2023, Gilmer County has one permanent traffic light. It is located in the town of Glenville.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Gilmer County was divided into four districts: Centre, De Kalb, Glenville, and Troy. In the 1980s, De Kalb and Troy Districts were combined to form De Kalb-Troy District, and a new district, City, was established.

==Politics==
Historically, Gilmer County was the northwesternmost of the fiercely Democratic, secessionist counties of West Virginia. It voted Democratic in every election from 1872 to 1968 – in 1928 when there was large-scale anti-Catholic voting throughout Appalachian West Virginia it was Al Smith’s strongest county in the state. In 1972, against the strongly left-wing George McGovern, Richard Nixon became the first Republican to carry the county in 104 years, and in a similar landslide Ronald Reagan repeated this in 1984. Like all of West Virginia, since 2000 Gilmer County has seen a powerful swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views.

<text>Fayette County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,488. Its county seat is Fayetteville. It is part of the Beckley, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area in Southern West Virginia.

==History==
Fayette County—originally Fayette County, Virginia—was created by the Virginia General Assembly in February 1831, from parts of Greenbrier, Kanawha, Nicholas, and Logan counties. It was named in honor of the Marquis de la Fayette, who had played a key role assisting the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

The second Virginia county so named, it was among the 50 counties which Virginia lost when West Virginia was admitted to the Union as the 35th state in 1863, during the American Civil War. The earlier Fayette County, Virginia existed from 1780 to 1792, and was lost when Kentucky was admitted to the Union. Accordingly, in the government records of Virginia, there will be listings for Fayette County from 1780 to 1792 and Fayette County from 1831 to 1863.

A substantial portion was subdivided from Fayette County to form Raleigh County in 1850. In 1871, an Act of the West Virginia Legislature severed a small portion to form part of Summers County.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. Fayette County was originally divided into four townships: Falls, Fayetteville, Mountain Cove, and Sewell Mountain. A fifth township, Kanawha, was formed from part of Falls Township in 1870. These townships proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. The portion of Fayette County that was taken to form Summers County was from Sewell Mountain Township. A sixth district, Quinnimont, was organized in the 1880s, and a seventh, Nuttall, was formed from part of Mountain Cove District in the 1890s. In the 1970s, the historic magisterial districts were consolidated into three new districts: New Haven, Plateau, and Valley.

Fayette County was the location of a disastrous mine explosion at Red Ash in March 1900, in which 46 miners were killed.

Fayette County elected several African Americans to the West Virginia House of Delegates during the early decades of the 20th century including the first, second and third who served in the state legislature.

==Politics==
Fayette County&#x27;s political history is typical of West Virginia as a whole. The county leaned Democratic during the Third Party System before the power of industrial and mining political systems turned it strongly towards the Republican Party between 1880 and 1932. Unionization of its predominant coal mining workforce during the New Deal made the county powerfully Democratic between 1932 and 2008: no Republican in this period except Richard Nixon against George McGovern won forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote, and Lyndon Johnson in 1964 exceeded eighty percent against the conservative Barry Goldwater. However, the decline of mining unions and the out-migration of historical black mining families has produced a rapid swing to the Republican Party in the 21st century, with the Democratic vote share plummeting to barely 30% by 2020. 










==Economy==
The county has a tradition of coal mining, which still serves as a primary source of employment in the area. A Georgia Pacific lumber mill has its home to the west of Mt. Hope, adjacent to U.S. Route 19. There exists a large metal alloy plant in Alloy. The Mount Olive Correctional Complex, West Virginia&#x27;s only maximum security state prison, is also located in Fayette County. The economy has shifted significantly in recent years, with a large amount of money being spent in outdoor recreation and tourism.

<text>Doddridge County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,808. Its county seat is West Union.

Doddridge County is part of the Clarksburg, West Virginia, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===First settlers===
The area that became Doddridge County, Virginia – now West Virginia – was first settled in the late 1780s by James Caldwell, who owned of land that included present West Union. Caldwell sold this land to Nathan Davis, Jr (1772-1866) and his brothers Joseph and William around 1807. They in turn sold to Lewis Maxwell (1790-1862), a Virginia Assembly delegate in the 1820s who later became a U.S. Congressman. In 1828 Ephraim Bee, Sr (1802–1888) and his wife Catherine established a log home on Meathouse Fork of Middle Island Creek, now part of West Union. They built an Inn across the &quot;Creek&quot; (really a river) at what was then called Lewisport (Congressman Maxwell&#x27;s namesake), below a blockhouse on the Northwestern Turnpike. The &quot;Beehive Inn&quot; became a popular place for travelers and locals to meet, refresh themselves and re-provision. Bee operated the first local blacksmith shop; a farm, stables, tannery and horse-racing track soon followed.

According to Ephraim&#x27;s father, A.A. Bee: &quot;The first bridge across Middle Island Creek [at West Union] was of hewed logs with a center abutment of stones. In the great flood of 1835 it was washed away&quot;. In 1842, a contract was awarded to the well-known civil engineer Claudius Crozet to build a covered bridge at West Union, as part of a series of public works along the Turnpike. Ephraim Bee was later to become a district officer, magistrate, state legislator, hotelier, and postmaster. As blacksmith, he made all the bolts and bands for the West Union Covered Bridge, completed in 1843.

===New county===
Doddridge County was officially created in 1845 from parts of Harrison, Tyler, Ritchie, and Lewis Counties of what was then still Virginia. It was named for Philip Doddridge (1773–1832), the late statesman of western Virginia who was the leading voice for westerners during the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830. When it was announced the new county would be formed, Ephraim Bee rallied to locate the county seat at Lewisport. But Nathan Davis, Jr (who was Ephraim&#x27;s wife&#x27;s uncle), William Fitz Randolph, and others, won out in favor of West Union, across the river on the south side. There Ethelbert Bond (Nathan&#x27;s son-in-law and William&#x27;s wife&#x27;s cousin) laid out the town lots in regular fashion on land formerly owned by Davis.

Progress of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, on its way from Clarksburg to Parkersburg, reached and bisected the county in 1856.

On the night of March 27, 1858, a fire devastated the town of West Union.

West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861, after the American Civil War had begun.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Doddridge County was divided into six districts: Central, Grant, McClellan, New Milton, Southwest, and West Union. A seventh district, Greenbrier, was created from part of New Milton in 1885; and an eighth, Cove, was formed from part of Southwest District between 1890 and 1900. The historic magisterial districts were consolidated into four new districts between 1980 and 1990: Beech, Maple, Oak, and Pine.

Maxwell Ridge – named for the Congressman&#x27;s family – is said to have a cave (Gatrell Cave) that was used by the Underground Railroad in the years leading up to the Civil War. Another nearby grotto, Jaco Cave, is said to have been used for the same purpose and is also featured in a movie from the 1970s called “No Drums, No Bugles” which features some locals as well as Martin Sheen, father of Charlie Sheen.

The county seat of West Union was incorporated on July 20, 1881.

===Oil and gas boom===
Doddridge County&#x27;s oil and gas industry was an enormous boon to residents. The county&#x27;s first oil pool, at Center Point, was discovered (&quot;brought in&quot; as it was then termed) and drilled in 1892. This was an extension of the technology and boom of the western Pennsylvania oil and gas fields into Tyler and Doddridge Counties. Many farm owners, and sons of farm owners, split their time between their farmwork and the petroleum operations. Almost every local farm benefited from this as free gas was piped to the farmhouses of many landowners. Gas was soon used for heating, lighting, and cooking, which replaced the wood stoves, kerosene and candles of previous generations. By 1906, the Ideal Glass Factory opened to take advantage of the abundant natural gas. It was followed by the Doddridge County Window Glass Company. The two plants employed about 300 people. In later years a garment factory opened, but closed in the mid-1990s.

A long-remembered flood devastated West Union in June 1950, destroying homes and businesses and killing more than 20 people throughout the county. (One casualty was the 107-year-old covered bridge.)

Today farming, timbering, oil and gas, and the business of county government and public education support the area, and many people commute to jobs in Salem, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg, or to the North Central Regional Jail in Greenwood.

The Lathrop Russell Charter House, Doddridge County Courthouse, Silas P. Smith Opera House, and W. Scott Stuart House are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. West Union is also home to two nationally recognized historic districts: West Union Downtown Historic District and West Union Residential Historic District.

==Politics==
After having leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party between the New Deal and Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, most of West Virginia has since 2000 seen an extremely rapid swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social issues. In contrast, Doddridge County along with neighbouring Ritchie County and Tyler County were historically powerfully Unionist and have always been rock-ribbed Republican since the Civil War. Only two Democratic presidential candidates have won Doddridge County since West Virginia&#x27;s statehood: Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, and Lyndon Johnson – who won by just six votes – in 1964.

Calhoun County was divided into five districts: Centre, Lee, Sheridan, Sherman, and Washington. Between 1980 and 1990, the county was reorganized into five new magisterial districts: District 1, District 2, District 3, District 4, and District 5.

<text>Cabell County is a county located in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 94,350, making it West Virginia&#x27;s fourth most-populous county. Its county seat is Huntington. The county was organized in 1809 and named for William H. Cabell, the Governor of Virginia from 1805 to 1808. Cabell County is part of the Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Cabell County was created by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on January 2, 1809, out of Kanawha County. The county was named in honor of William H. Cabell, who served as Governor of Virginia from 1805 to 1808.

=== First Inhabitants ===
Many of the first inhabitants in Cabell County were the Mound Builders. More specifically, the Adena people. Later, many Hurons occupied the area until they were driven out by the Iroquois Confederacy. By the 1700s the area of Cabell County was mostly used as hunting grounds by the indigenous populations in the area.

=== European settlement ===
The first European to set foot in present-day Cabell County was most likely Robert Cavelier de La Salle, who sailed down the Ohio River in 1669. The first English explorers were probably Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam, who explored the area in September 1671. While they explored the area, they found tree markings with the letters MANI and MA, signifying to them that other Englishmen that been there before.

The Savage Grant of 1772 was made to John Savage and 60 others for service during the French and Indian War. William Buffington purchased lot 42 of this grant and willed it to his two sons, Thomas and William Buffington. Thomas and his brother Jonathan came to present-day Cabell County in 1796 and found Thomas Hannon. Hannon is regarded as the first settler in Cabell County.

=== 1800s ===
Cabell County&#x27;s location along the Ohio River made it a natural resting place and port for westward travelers. Areas such as Guyandotte and Holderby&#x27;s Landing (present-day Huntington) became ferrying points. The James River and Kanawha Turnpike was extended to Barboursville in 1814. In 1837, Marshall Academy was formed at Holdby&#x27;s Landing. The school was named after Chief Justice John Marshall, a friend of local lawyer John Laidley. The academy was incorporated in 1838 by the Virginia State Legislature. In 1867, Marshall Academy was created as the State Normal School of Marshall College to train teachers. Marshall College gained University status in 1961.

=== Civil War ===
Prior to the outbreak of conflict, the citizens of Cabell County were largely divided on the issue secession. The arrival of Eli Thayer and his Ceredo Experiment caused an uproar in the county. After the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, a militia was formed called the Border Rangers led by Albert Gallatin Jenkins. The first engagement of the Civil War in Cabell County was the Battle of Barboursville in 1861. Later that same year, the town of Guyandotte was raided and eventually burned by the Union Army. The county&#x27;s economy suffered greatly after the burning of Guyandotte, but the proximity to the Ohio River and arrival of the railroad boasted the county. In 1871, railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington laid out and founded the city of Huntington, near Holdby&#x27;s Landing, as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad.

=== 1900s ===
Several industries entered Cabell County as a result of the establishment of Huntington. This influx of industry boast the economy, which saw a boom period until the Ohio River Flood of 1937. Huntington saw the introduction of the state&#x27;s first radio station in 1923 and the state&#x27;s first television station in 1949. The construction of Interstate 64 in the 1960s also saw a growth in the local economy.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (2.4%) is water.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Cabell County was divided into five districts: Barboursville, Grant, Guyandotte, McComas, and Union. Two additional districts, Gideon and Kyle, were established between 1920 and 1930. Between 1980 and 1990, the county was redivided into five districts: District 1, District 2, District 3, District 4, and District 5. The names and boundaries of the historic districts were preserved in the form of tax and assessment districts.

<text>The Taiwan Strait is a -wide strait separating the island of Taiwan and the Asian continent. The strait is part of the South China Sea and connects to the East China Sea to the north. The narrowest part is wide.

==Names==
Former names of the Taiwan Strait include the or from a dated name for Taiwan; the or Fujian, from the Chinese province forming the strait&#x27;s western shore; and the , a calque of the strait&#x27;s name in Hokkien and Hakka.

== Geography ==

The Taiwan Strait is the body of water separating Fujian Province from Taiwan Island. The international agreement does not define the Taiwan Strait but places its waters within the South China Sea, whose northern limit runs from Cape Fugui (the northernmost point on Taiwan Island; Fukikaku) to Niushan Island to the southernmost point of Pingtan Island and thence westward along the parallel N. to the coast of Fujian Province. The draft for a new edition of the IHO&#x27;s &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot; does precisely define the Taiwan Strait, classifying it as part of the North Pacific Ocean. It makes the Taiwan Strait a body of water &quot;between&quot; the East and South China Seas and delimits it:

The entire strait is on Asia&#x27;s continental shelf. It is almost entirely less than deep, with a short ravine of that depth off the southwest coast of Taiwan. As such, there are many islands in the strait. The largest and most important islands off the coast of Fujian are Xiamen, Gulangyu, Pingtan (the &quot;Haitan&quot; of the IHO delineation), Kinmen, and Matsu. The first three are controlled by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC); the last two by the Republic Of China (ROC). Within the strait lie the Penghu or the Pescadores, also controlled by the ROC. There is a major underwater bank north of the Penghu Islands.

All of Fujian Province&#x27;s rivers except the Ting run into the Taiwan Strait. The largest two are the Min and the Jiulong.
===Median line===
A theoretical &quot;median line&quot;, also known as the Davis line, was defined down the middle of the strait by US Air Force General Benjamin O. Davis Jr. in 1955, after which the US pressured both sides not to cross it. As a tacit understanding, it never gained official or legal status. The PRC has never recognized the median line. Aircraft from Taiwan crossed it frequently until the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. Between 1954 and 2019, generally did not cross the area, with military craft crossing three times in that period.

In 2019, Taiwan&#x27;s defense ministry provided coordinates for the median line. The ministry recognizes the line as running from 27°N, 122°E in the north to 23°N, 118°E on the southern end.

In 2019, PLA warplanes crossed the median line for the first time since 1999. In 2020, the PRC Foreign Ministry explicitly denied the existence of a median line and no longer act as if such a line exists.

== Geology ==

=== Sediment distribution ===
Each year, Taiwan&#x27;s rivers carry up to 370 million tons of sediments into the sea, including 60 to 150 million tons deposited into the Taiwan Strait. During the past ten thousand years, 600 billion tons of riverine sediments have been deposited in the Taiwan Strait, locally forming a lobe up to 40 m thick in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait.

== History ==

The Strait mostly separated the Han culture of the Chinese mainland from Taiwan Island&#x27;s aborigines for millennia, although the Hakka and Hoklo traded and migrated across it. European explorers, principally the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch, also took advantage of the strait to establish forward bases for trade with the mainland during the Ming; the bases were also used for raiding both the Chinese coast and the trading ships of rival countries.

Widespread Chinese migration across the strait began in the late Ming. During the Qing conquest, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) expelled the Dutch and established the Kingdom of Tungning in 1661, planning to launch a reconquest of the mainland in the name of the Southern Ming branches of the old imperial dynasty. Dorgon and the Kangxi Emperor were able to consolidate their control over southern mainland China; Koxinga found himself limited to raiding across the strait. His grandson Zheng Keshuang surrendered to the Qing after his admiral lost the 1683 Battle of the Penghu Islands in the middle of the strait.

Japan seized the Penghu Islands during the First Sino-Japanese War and gained control of Taiwan at its conclusion in 1895. Control of the eastern half of the strait was used to establish control of the southern Chinese coast during the Second World War. The strait protected Japanese bases and industry in Taiwan from Chinese attack and sabotage, but aerial warfare reached the island by 1943. The 1944 Formosa Air Battle gave the United States Pacific Fleet air supremacy from its carrier groups and Philippine bases; subsequently, the bombing was continuous until Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945. The rapid advance of the Communist PLA in 1949 provoked the government&#x27;s retreat across the Taiwan Strait.

In the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War, People&#x27;s Republic of China and Republic of China had multiple brief armed conflicts on the Taiwan Strait, consequently named the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, and the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. These confrontations did not result in large-scale military conflicts between China and Taiwan. In the 21st century, the Cross-Strait relations stabilized, leading to the establishment of Three Links on 15 December 2008, with the commencement of direct commercial flights, shipping, and post across the Taiwan Strait.

On 25 May 2002, China Airlines Flight 611 broke up in mid-air and crashed into the Taiwan Strait, killing all 225 people on board. On 26 February 2022, China denounced the sailing of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 7th Fleet Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer through the Taiwan Strait as a &quot;provocative act&quot;.

Since 2018 China has denied that the concept of international waters applies to the Taiwan Strait. China does not claim sovereignty over the entire strait but seeks to regulate what it views as &quot;support for the Taiwan authorities and muscle-flexing against the mainland&quot;. This position has led to concerns from American, Australian, and French officials and objection from Taiwan. &quot;International waters&quot; is technically not defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and there is no high seas corridor within the Taiwan Strait, but transit rights mimicking high seas such as innocent passage and freedom of navigation are generally allowed within exclusive economic zones.

== Economy ==
Fishermen have used the strait as a fishing resource since time immemorial. In the modern world, it is the gateway used by ships of almost every kind on passage to and from nearly all the important ports in Northeast Asia. Chinese vessels often trespass into Taiwanese territorial waters to fish or dredge sand, leading to interceptions by the Coast Guard Administration as well as seizures, confiscations, and fines.

Taiwan is building major wind farms in the strait.

<text>Brooke County is a county in the Northern Panhandle of the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,559. Its county seat is Wellsburg. The county was created in 1797 from part of Ohio County and named in honor of Robert Brooke, Governor of Virginia from 1794 to 1796. Brooke County is part of the Weirton-Steubenville, WV-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-WV-OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The Ohio Company of Virginia petitioned the British King for 500,000 acres of land in the Ohio River Valley in 1747, but the first settlers to this area, in what later became known as West Virginia&#x27;s Northern Panhandle, were brothers Jonathan, Israel and Friend Cox. They staked a &quot;tomahawk claim&quot; to 1200 acres (400 acres for each brother) at the mouth of Buffalo Creek and extending along the Ohio River. Their cousin George Cox staked an adjacent claim a few years later.

In 1788 Charles Prather purchased 481 acres from Friend Cox&#x27;s heir, John Cox; by that year&#x27;s end Alexander Wells, formerly of Baltimore, Maryland and later of Cross Creek Township, Pennsylvania, established a trading post (together with his Baltimore cousin Richard Owings). In 1791 the Ohio County Court incorporated the town around the post as &quot;Charlestown&quot; (after Prather&#x27;s first name). On November 30, 1796, the Virginia General Assembly formed Brooke County, from parts of Ohio County, and designated &quot;Charlestown&quot; as the county seat. Across the Appalachian Continental Divide to the east in Jefferson County, another Charlestown had previously been incorporated (it is now known as Charles Town). In addition, Charleston had been established at the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha rivers in 1788.

Addressing this confusion, the Virginia General Assembly on December 28, 1816, changed the Brooke county seat&#x27;s name from &quot;Charlestown&quot; to Wellsburg, supposedly to honor Charles Wells, Prather&#x27;s son-in-law. The first Masonic Lodge west of the Allegheny Mountains was established in Wellsburg on March 4, 1799. It was under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for six years, but since December 17, 1817, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Virginia and later of West Virginia.

The first glass factory in Wellsburg was built in 1813, taking advantage of the relatively easy transportation on the Ohio River. When the National Road was built about five years later, its first crossing of the Ohio River was via a ferry further west. In 1818 Alexander Campbell founded the first Virginia school west of the Appalachians, which the Virginia General Assembly chartered in 1840 as Bethany College.

During the American Civil War, Brooke County&#x27;s elected officials helped found the new state of West Virginia, after their efforts to block secession failed at the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. Wellsburg received a new charter in 1866 from the newly established West Virginia legislature, and Samuel Marks became Wellsburg&#x27;s first elected mayor.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Brooke County was divided into three districts: Buffalo, Cross Creek, and Wellsburg. Wellsburg District was co-extensive with the city of Wellsburg. The districts of Follansbee and Weirton were created between 1970 and 1980. Buffalo and Cross Creek Districts were discontinued in 2008.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water. It is the second-smallest county in West Virginia by area. The highest point of elevation in Brooke County is approximately 1372 ft. and located about 1.5 miles south of Franklin.

==Law and government==
Brooke County is governed by a three-member County Commission who each serve in rotating 6-year terms. The terms are designed such that one seat is up for election in even years. The County Commission annually chooses its own President. The Brooke County Commissioners in 2022 are President AJ Thomas, Tim Ennis, and Stacey Wise.

Brooke County is part of the First Judicial Circuit of West Virginia, which also includes Hancock and Ohio counties. In West Virginia, Circuit Judges are elected in non-partisan elections to eight-year terms. The current judges of the First Judicial Circuit are the Hon. Jason A. Cuomo, the Hon. James Mazzone, the Hon. David J. Sims, and the Hon. Ronald E. Wilson. All four Circuit Court judges were re-elected in November 2016.

Magistrates are elected in partisan elections serving four-year terms. Vacancies occurring in unexpired terms can be filled by a respective Circuit Court Judge. Unlike Circuit Court judges or Family Court judges, magistrates are not required to be attorneys. Brooke County currently has two magistrates: Robin Snyder and Danielle Diserio.

===Politics===
Abutting free states Ohio and Pennsylvania, and with a largely German-American culture unlike any other part of antebellum Virginia, Brooke County and the rest of the Northern Panhandle were central to the vanguard who made West Virginia a new state during the Civil War. For the next six and a half decades the county, aided by its association with Pennsylvania&#x27;s powerful ironmonger-led Republican machines, voted solidly Republican to the point of supporting William Howard Taft during the disastrously divided 1912 election. From the New Deal until Bill Clinton, however, powerful unionization meant that Brooke County turned from solidly Republican to solidly Democratic except when the Democrats nominated the staunchly progressive George McGovern in 1972. Like all of West Virginia, since 2000 a combination of declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party&#x27;s liberal views on social issues has produced a dramatic swing to the Republican Party.

<doc id="91054" wikidata="Q490925" url="?curid=91054" title="Boone County, West Virginia">
<text>Boone County is a county in the U.S. state of West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,809. Its county seat is Madison. Boone County is part of the Charleston, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Leading industries and chief agricultural products in Boone County include coal, lumber, natural gas, tobacco, and strawberries.

==History==
The county was formed in 1847 with territories annexed from Kanawha, Cabell, and Logan counties. It was named for frontiersman Daniel Boone, who lived in the Great Kanawha Valley from 1789 until 1795.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Boone County was divided into five districts: Crook, Peytona, Scott, Sherman, and Washington. Between 1980 and 1990, the county was redivided into three magisterial districts: District 1, District 2, and District 3.

On February 1, 2006, two fatal mining accidents occurred in the communities of Uneeda and Wharton in Boone County. These two deaths with the addition of January&#x27;s Sago Mine disaster and the Aracoma Alma Mine disaster caused West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin to close all of West Virginia&#x27;s mines in a &quot;mine safety stand-down.&quot;

==Geography==
Boone County lies in the central southwestern part of West Virginia. Its terrain consists of low wooded mountains, carved with drainages. The terrain slopes to the north and west, with its highest point at its south corner, at ASL. The county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

<text>Berkeley County is located in the Shenandoah Valley in the eastern panhandle region of West Virginia in the United States. The county is part of the Hagerstown–Martinsburg metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the county population was 122,076, making it the second-most populous of West Virginia&#x27;s 55 counties, behind Kanawha County. The City of Martinsburg is the county seat.

==History==
Created on May 15, 1772, by an act of the House of Burgesses from the northern third of Frederick County when it was part of Virginia, Berkeley County went on to become West Virginia&#x27;s second-oldest county after that state seceded from Virginia in 1863 during the Civil War. At the time of the county&#x27;s formation, Berkeley County comprised areas that now are part of present-day Jefferson and Morgan counties in West Virginia.

Most historians believe the county was named for Norborne Berkeley, Baron de Botetourt (1718–1770), Colonial Governor of Virginia from 1768 to 1770. West Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Blue Book&quot;, for example, indicates Berkeley County was named in his honor. He served as a colonel in England&#x27;s North Gloucestershire militia in 1761, and represented that division of the county in Parliament until he was made a peer in 1764. Having incurred heavy gambling debts, he solicited a government appointment and in July 1768 was made Governor of Virginia. In 1769, he reluctantly dissolved the House of Burgesses after it adopted resolutions that opposed Parliament&#x27;s replacement of requisitions with parliamentary taxes as a means of generating revenue and a requirement for accused American criminals to be sent to England for trial.

Despite his differences with the House of Burgesses, Berkeley was well respected by the colonists, especially after he sent Parliament letters encouraging them to repeal the taxes. When Parliament refused to rescind them, Governor Berkeley requested to be recalled. In appreciation of his efforts, the colonists erected a monument to his memory in Williamsburg, and two counties were later named in his honor: Berkeley in present-day West Virginia and Botetourt in Virginia.

Other historians claim Berkeley County may have been named in honor of Sir William Berkeley (1610–1677), who was born near London, graduated from Oxford University in 1629 and was appointed Governor of Virginia in 1642. He served as Governor until 1652 and was reappointed Governor in 1660. Berkeley presided over the colony during Bacon’s Rebellion of 1676, and was called back to England the following year.

===Early settlers===
According to missionary reports, several thousand Hurons occupied present-day West Virginia, including the eastern panhandle region, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. During the 17th century, the Iroquois Confederacy (then consisting of the Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, Oneida, and Seneca tribes) drove the Hurons from the state. The Iroquois Confederacy was headquartered in New York and was not interested in occupying present-day West Virginia. Instead, they used it as a hunting ground during the spring and summer months.

During the early 18th century, West Virginia&#x27;s eastern panhandle region was inhabited by the Tuscarora. They eventually migrated northward into New York and, in 1712, became the sixth nation formally admitted into the Iroquois Confederacy. The eastern panhandle region was also used as a hunting ground by several other Indian tribes, including the Shawnee (then known as the Shawanese) who resided near present-day Winchester, Virginia and Moorefield, West Virginia until 1754 when they migrated into Ohio. The Mingo, who resided in the Tygart Valley and along the Ohio River in present-day West Virginia&#x27;s northern panhandle region, and the Delaware, who lived in present-day eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, but had several autonomous settlements as far south as present-day Braxton County, also used the area as a hunting ground.

Following the French and Indian War, the Mingo retreated to their homes along the banks of the Ohio River and were rarely seen in the eastern panhandle region. Although the French and Indian War was over, many Indians continued to view the British as a threat to their sovereignty and continued to fight them. In the summer of 1763, Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, led raids on key British forts in the Great Lakes region. Shawnee chief Keigh-tugh-qua, also known as Cornstalk, led similar attacks on western Virginia settlements, starting with attacks in present-day Greenbrier County and extending northward to Berkeley Springs, and into the northern Shenandoah Valley. By the end of July, Indians had destroyed or captured all British forts west of the Alleghenies except Fort Detroit, Fort Pitt, and Fort Niagara. The uprisings were ended on August 6, 1763, when British forces, under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet, defeated Delaware and Shawnee forces at Bushy Run in western Pennsylvania.

During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the Mingo and Shawnee, headquartered at Chillicothe, allied themselves with the British. In 1777, a party of 350 Wyandots, Shawnees, and Mingos, armed by the British, attacked Fort Henry, near present-day Wheeling. Nearly half of the soldiers manning the fort were killed in the three-day assault. The Indians then left the area celebrating their victory. For the remainder of the war, smaller raiding parties of Mingo, Shawnee, and other Indian tribes repelled settlers throughout northern and eastern West Virginia. As a result, European settlement throughout present-day West Virginia, including the eastern panhandle, came to a virtual standstill until the war&#x27;s conclusion.

Following the war, the Mingo and Shawnee, once again allied with the losing side, returned to their homes. As the number of settlers in present-day West Virginia began to grow, both the Mingo and Shawnee moved further inland, leaving their traditional hunting ground to the white settlers.

===17th-century European explorers===
In 1670, John Lederer, a German physician and explorer employed by Sir William Berkeley, colonial governor of Virginia, became the first European to set foot in present-day Berkeley County; their safety was not guaranteed. John Howard and his son also passed through present-day Berkeley County a few years later, and discovered the valley of the South Branch Potomac River at Green Spring.

===The 18th century===
The next known explorer to traverse the county was John Van Meter (1683–1745) in the 1730s. He came across the Potomac River, at what is now known as Shepherdstown, then he made his way to the South Branch Potomac River. In 1726, Morgan Morgan moved from Delaware and founded the first permanent English settlement of record in West Virginia on Mill Creek near the present-day Bunker Hill in Berkeley County. The state of West Virginia erected a monument in Bunker Hill commemorating the event, and placed a marker at Morgan&#x27;s grave, which is located in a cemetery near the park. Morgan Morgan and his wife, Catherine Garretson, had eight children. His son, Zackquill Morgan, later founded present-day Morgantown.

In 1730, John Van Meter, with his brother Isaac (1692–1757), secured a patent for at the South Branch Potomac River, much of it in present-day Berkeley County, from Virginia&#x27;s Colonial Lieutenant Governor William Gooch. Part of the land was sold the following year to Hans Yost Heydt, also known as Joist Hite or Jost Hite. In 1732, Heydt (Hite) and fifteen families set out from York, Pennsylvania, passed through present-day Berkeley County, and settled near present-day Winchester, Virginia. In 1744, Isaac Van Meter moved to a site near Moorefield — then part of Hampshire County, but now in Hardy County (see Fort Pleasant) — where he was later killed by Indians. (His brother John settled and died in Winchester, Virginia.)

In 1748, George Washington, then just sixteen years old, surveyed present-day Berkeley County for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. He later returned to Bath (Berkeley Springs), West Virginia several times over the next several years with his half-brother, Lawrence, who was ill and hoped that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous Native Americans as well as Europeans to the area.

===The 19th century===
Berkeley County was reduced in size twice during the 19th century. On January 8, 1801, Jefferson County was formed out of the county&#x27;s eastern section. Then, on February 9, 1820, Morgan County was formed out of the county&#x27;s western section and parts of Hampshire County.

Berkeley County was strategically important to both the North and the South during the American Civil War (from 1861 to 1865). The county, and Martinsburg, its seat, lay at the northern edge of the Shenandoah Valley, and Martinsburg was important because the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran through it. The B&amp;O was valuable to both armies for moving men and materiel. Increasing Martinsburg&#x27;s strategic value was its proximity to the United States Arsenal and Armory at Harpers Ferry. Control over Martinsburg changed hands many times during the war, especially prior to the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. After Gettysburg, the city remained mostly under Union control.

About 75% of Berkeley County&#x27;s residents were loyal to the South during the American Civil War. Confederate fervor was even more evident with military enlistment, at least about 80% of soldiers fought for the South. There were at least eleven companies of soldiers recruited from the county: at least nine for the Confederate Army but only two for the Union Army. In addition, the local militia sided with the Confederacy.

The Confederate units consisted of the following: Chew&#x27;s Battery Virginia Horse Artillery (a.k.a. Capt. James W. Thomson&#x27;s &amp; Capt. John W. Carter&#x27;s Co.), Capt. Osmond B. Taylor&#x27;s Co. Virginia Light Artillery, Wise Artillery (Co. B, 1st Regiment Virginia Light Artillery), Co. F Clark&#x27;s Co (12th Virginia Cavalry), Co. A Wildcat Cavalry (11th Virginia Cavalry), Co. B Berkeley Troop (1st Virginia Cavalry), Co. F Shepherdstown Troop (1st Virginia Cavalry), Co. D Berkeley Border Guards (2nd Virginia Infantry), Co. E Hedgesville Blues (2nd Virginia Infantry), and 67th Regiment Virginia Militia. It is also believed that soldiers from Berkeley County participated in other Confederate units as well, such as the 7th Virginia Cavalry, whose Co. F and G recruited out of neighboring Hampshire and Jefferson Counties 

The Union units consisted of Co. C 3rd Regiment, West Virginia Cavalry, and Company B First Regiment, (West) Virginia Volunteers.

Yet it was (then-Colonel) Stonewall Jackson who wrote to Robert E. Lee, &quot;... I regret to say that in Berkeley things are growing worse, and that the threats from Union men are calculated to curb the expression of Southern feeling.&quot;

A member of the Stonewall Brigade also wrote, &quot;We left Winchester the first of this week [in June, 1861] and came to Berkeley County, the meanest Abolition hole on the face of the earth, Martinsburg especially.&quot;

At least six hundred men from Berkeley County served in either the Confederate Army or the Union Army. When the vote for separation from Confederate Virginia was held, the majority voted for the Union creation of the state of West Virginia.

Berkeley County was also the home of Maria Isabella &quot;Belle&quot; Boyd, a famous spy for the Confederacy.

===Joining West Virginia===
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Berkeley and Jefferson counties, both lying on the Potomac River east of the mountains, with the consent of the Reorganized Government of Virginia, voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia in 1863. The occupying Federal troops in the area ensured the desired outcome. Many voters absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken refused to acknowledge the transfer upon their return. The Virginia General Assembly repealed the Act of Secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia, asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia. Meanwhile, Congress, on March 10, 1866, passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer. In 1871, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Virginia v. West Virginia&quot;, upholding the secession of West Virginia, including Berkeley and Jefferson counties, from Virginia.

In 1863, West Virginia&#x27;s counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Berkeley County was divided into seven districts: Arden, Falling Waters, Gerrardstown, Hedgesville, Martinsburg, Mill Creek, and Opequon. The town of Martinsburg was originally co-extensive with Martinsburg District, but later spread into adjoining districts. Between 1990 and 2000, Berkeley County was redivided into six magisterial districts: Adam Stephens, Norborne, Potomac, Shenandoah, Tuscarora, and Valley.

==Politics==
After having leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party between the New Deal and Bill Clinton’s presidency, most of West Virginia has since 2000 seen a powerful swing towards the Republican Party due to declining unionization and differences with the Democratic Party’s liberal views on social issues. Berkeley County, in contrast, was in the majority opposed to secession at the Virginia Secession Convention and has voted solidly Republican over most of the century and a half since, with the exception of Democratic landslides. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Berkeley County since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. However, likely due to its exurban DC status, it has not swung to the right as much as West Virginia as a whole, and has voted increasingly more Democratic than the state beginning in 2008.

<text>Yakima County is a county in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 256,728. The county seat and most populous city is Yakima. The county was formed out of Ferguson County in January 1865 and is named for the Yakama tribe of Native Americans.

Yakima County comprises the Yakima, WA Metropolitan Statistical Area and is Washington state&#x27;s most populous majority-Hispanic county as of 2020.

==History==
The area that now comprises Yakima County was part of the Oregon Country at the start of the nineteenth century, inhabited both by fur prospectors from Canada, and Americans seeking land for agricultural and mineral-extraction opportunities. Unable to resolve which country should control this vast area, the Treaty of 1818 provided for joint control. By 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon had been established, although at first there were questions as to its authority and extent. During its existence, that provisional government formed the area north of the Columbia River first into the Washington Territory, and then (December 19, 1845) into two vast counties: Clark and Lewis.

The Washington Territory was formed as a separate governing entity in 1853. In 1854, that legislature carved several counties out of the two original large counties, including Skamania County. Later in 1854 the new Skamania County was reduced in size by carving out Walla Walla County. This arrangement lasted until January 23, 1863, when Ferguson County was carved out of Walla Walla County. However, the Ferguson County government and boundary was dissolved on January 18, 1865, and its area was assigned to Yakima County three days later.

Since its creation, the Yakima County boundary has been altered two times. In 1883 a portion of its area was carved off in the creation of Kittitas County, and in 1905 a further reduction added to the creation of Benton County.

The Yakama Indian Reservation was created in 1855. However, several tribes felt the agreement creating this reserved area had been completed without sufficient native input, and skirmishes and local war (the Yakima War, which lasted until 1858) meant that the reservation was not fully operational for two decades. The Reservation is the 15th largest reservation in America, covering , and comprising 36% of the county&#x27;s total area. Its population was 31,799 in 2000, and its largest city is Toppenish.

==Geography==


According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water. Yakima County is the second-largest county in Washington by land area and third-largest by total area. Yakima County is reputed to be one of the most difficult places on earth to predict weather, because of its surrounding mountains. The county&#x27;s area is larger than the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. The highest point in the county is Mount Adams, which is the second tallest peak in Washington and the third tallest in the Cascade Range.

==Politics==
Yakima County leans Republican in statewide elections. On only four occasions has it backed a Democrat for President – it has voted for the same candidate as the state of South Dakota in every election since they first voted for President – and the last Democratic gubernatorial candidate it backed was Albert D. Rosellini in 1956.

Only Adams County and Columbia County, which last backed a Democrat for governor in 1936 when Clarence D. Martin swept every county in the state, have consistently backed Republicans for governor for longer. Although Yakima County did narrowly support Maria Cantwell in 2012, the previous U.S. senate candidate to carry Yakima County for the Democrats was popular Senator &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson in 1982.

<text>Whitman County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,973. The county seat is Colfax, and its largest city is Pullman.

The county was formed from Stevens County in 1871. It is named after Marcus Whitman, a Presbyterian missionary who, with his wife Narcissa, was killed in 1847 by members of the Cayuse tribe.

Whitman County comprises the Pullman, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area delineated by the future Washington state boundary began to be colonized at the start of the nineteenth century, both by Americans and Canadians. However, the majority of Canadian exploration and interest in the land was due to the fur trade, whereas American settlers were principally seeking land for agriculture and cattle raising. The Treaty of 1818 provided for dual control of this area by US and Canadian government officials. During this period, the future Washington Territory was divided into two administrative zones: Clark County and Lewis County (made official in 1845).

The dual-control concept was unwieldy and led to continual argument, and occasional conflict. The status of the Washington area was settled in 1846, when the Oregon Treaty ceded the land south of North latitude 49 degrees to American control.

In 1854, Skamania County was split from the original Clark County. Also in 1854, Walla Walla County was split from the new Skamania County. In 1863, Stevens County was split from Walla Walla County, and in 1871, a portion of Stevens County was set off to form Whitman County. The 1871 shape of Whitman County was considerably larger than its present boundary, as Adams, Franklin, and Lincoln counties were sectioned off from Whitman County in 1883. After that, Whitman County retained its shape, including through the period after Washington became the 42nd state of the Union in 1889.

==Geography==

==Politics==
Despite the county historically voting for Republicans, Whitman County has a reputation as being far more socially liberal than other counties in Eastern Washington due to the presence of Washington State University in Pullman. It is part of Washington&#x27;s 5th congressional district and is represented by Republican Michael Baumgartner. Quite conservative, rural Whitman was one of only three counties in the state to be won by Barry Goldwater in 1964. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush each won the county twice.

In 2008, Barack Obama received 51.57% of the Whitman County vote. In 2012, he received 46.9% of the vote, with Mitt Romney winning with a 49.7% plurality. Whitman was the only county in eastern Washington to approve same-sex marriage via Referendum 74. It was the only county to vote in favor of Referendum 74 while voting for the Republican candidate for president. Whitman County voters also approved marijuana legalization via Initiative 502.

By 2016, the county was considered Democratic in regard to federal elections. Hillary Clinton won the county in 2016 and also voted for Patty Murray in 2016. However, Republican Bill Bryant won this county over incumbent Democrat Jay Inslee by a percentage point in the concurrent gubernatorial election. In the 2020 elections, the majority of the county voted for Democrat Joe Biden for president and re-elected Inslee for governor. Both received majority of the county vote with Inslee becoming the first Democratic gubernatorial candidate to win a county in Eastern Washington since Gary Locke in 2000. However, the county still votes Republican in U.S. House elections.

In 2020, 52.9% of residents voted for Biden while 42.9% voted for Trump, a 10% margin for Biden.

The county was one of two in Eastern Washington to vote for 2018 Washington Initiative 1639, which strengthened gun laws, along with neighboring Spokane County.












==Economy==

The county is also home to Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories in Pullman.

==Education==
Pullman is home to Washington State University, the state&#x27;s land-grant university.

<text>Whatcom County (, ) is a county located in the northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Washington, bordered by the Lower Mainland (the Metro Vancouver and Fraser Valley Regional Districts) of the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, Okanogan County to the east, Skagit County to the south, San Juan County across Rosario Strait to the southwest, and the Strait of Georgia to the west. Its county seat and largest population center is the coastal city of Bellingham. Whatcom County is coterminous with the Bellingham, WA Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the county&#x27;s population was 226,847.

The county was created from Island County by the Washington Territorial Legislature in March 1854. It originally included the territory of present-day San Juan and Skagit counties, which were later independently organized after additional settlement. Its name derives from the Lummi word &quot;Xwotʼqom&quot;, also spelled [x̣ʷátqʷəm], perhaps meaning &#x27;noisy&#x27; or &#x27;noisy water&#x27; and referring to a waterfall. Whatcom County has a diversified economy with a significant agricultural base, including approximately 60% of the nation&#x27;s annual production of raspberries.
==History==
The Whatcom County area has had known human habitation for at least twelve millennia. At least three aboriginal tribes have been identified in the area: Lummi (San Juan Islands, between Point Whitehorn and Chuckanut Bay), Nooksack (between Lynden and Maple Falls) and Semiahmoo (the northern portion, near Blaine).

This area was part of the Oregon Country at the start of the nineteenth century, inhabited both by fur prospectors from Canada and Americans seeking land for agricultural and mineral-extraction opportunities. Unable to resolve which country should control this vast area, the Treaty of 1818 provided for joint control. In 1827 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established Fort Langley near present Lynden.

By 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon had been established, although at first there were questions as to its authority and extent. During its existence, that provisional government formed the area north of the Columbia River first into the Washington Territory, and then (December 19, 1845) into two vast counties: Clark and Lewis. In 1852, a portion of Lewis County was partitioned off to form Thurston County, and in 1853 a portion of the new county was partitioned off to form Island County.

The Washington Territory was formed as a separate governing entity in 1853. In 1854, that legislature carved several counties out of the existing counties, including Whatcom County on March 9, 1854, with area taken from Island County. The original county boundary was reduced in 1873 by the formation of San Juan County, and again in 1883 by the formation of Skagit County.

In 1855 the settlers erected a blockhouse west of Whatcom Creek, to protect against forays from the aboriginal inhabitants who were attempting to defend their homelands. That year the Treaty of Point Elliott was signed, which assigned the Lummi and Semiahmoo peoples a greatly-restricted reserved area.

The short-lived Fraser Canyon Gold Rush (1857–58) caused a short-term increase in the county&#x27;s population, which briefly swelled to over 10,000 before the bubble burst.

In 1857 the federal government began the field work necessary to establish the national border between the United States and Canada, which had been agreed on as the forty-ninth parallel in this area, and which would also mark the north line of Whatcom County. As the work moved east, several of the workers chose to remain in the area as settlers.

==Border crossings==
Whatcom County&#x27;s northern border is the Canada–US border with the Canadian province of British Columbia. Adjoining the county on the north (from west to east) are the Metro Vancouver suburbs of Delta, Surrey, Langley, the central Fraser Valley city of Abbotsford and the rural Fraser Valley Regional District.

The border crossing points are (from west to east): 
* the Point Roberts Tyee Dr to Tsawwassen, a neighborhood in Delta, British Columbia
* the Peace Arch Border Crossing, where Interstate 5 meets British Columbia Highway 99
* the Pacific Highway Border Crossing connecting State Route 543 with British Columbia Highway 15, between Blaine and Surrey
* the Lynden–Aldergrove Border Crossing, where SR 539 connects to British Columbia Highway 13
* the Sumas–Huntingdon Border Crossing at Sumas (SR 9 connecting to Abbotsford, BC)
* An additional unmanned legal crossing connects British Columbia&#x27;s Skagit Valley Provincial Park to North Cascades National Park in Washington State.

Several shopping malls and other services in Bellingham and elsewhere in the county are geared to cross-border shopping and recreation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and , or 16%, is covered by water.

Western Whatcom County is part of the Fraser Lowland, the plain of the Fraser River, most of which is in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. At some periods in the past, one of the Fraser River&#x27;s distributaries may have entered Bellingham Bay near Bellingham at or near the modern-day mouth of the Nooksack River.

The remainder of Whatcom County is in the Cascade Range, including Mount Baker.
In their foothills is Lake Whatcom, which is drained by Whatcom Creek into Bellingham Bay.

A small part of the county, Point Roberts, about , is an extension of the Tsawwassen Peninsula, which is bisected by the Canada–US border along the 49th parallel. The highest point in the county is the peak of the active volcano Mount Baker at above sea level. The lowest points are at sea level along the Salish Sea, an arm of the Pacific Ocean.

==Government==
The Whatcom County government is a municipal corporation operating under a county charter approved in 1978; it acts as a county constitution. Whatcom County is one of seven Washington counties to use the home rule charter provision of state law. Local government is split between the county, incorporated cities and towns, and special-purpose districts. These local governments are established and operate according to state law, and operate independently from the county government.

===County government===
The charter establishes the structure of Whatcom County government. The Whatcom County Council holds legislative powers granted to counties. The council consists of seven members elected for a term of four years. Council members are elected at the general election in November of odd-numbered years. Three council members are elected one year before a presidential election; four council members are elected one year after a presidential election. One member is elected from each of the five districts; two members are elected at-large, which favors candidates who can command a majority of voters. The county council also serves as the county board of health.

The executive branch consists of six elected officials, a county executive, and five department heads. The county executive is similar to a mayor or governor. The assessor, auditor, prosecuting attorney, sheriff, and treasurer are elected independently from the county executive and council. These six officials serve four-year terms. The county council establishes various departments by ordinance. The county council or county executive appoint department heads. These departments include administrative services, health, medical examiner, planning and development services, parks and recreation, and public works.

The judicial branch consists of a district court and superior court. The district court is a court of limited jurisdiction that handles civil and criminal cases. Criminal cases are limited to adults charged with misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offenses. State law specifies what cases are in the district court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The district court operates a small claims court to resolve civil cases involving monetary damages not exceeding $5,000. No attorneys are permitted to appear in small claims court. Cases are heard using less formal procedures. The district court has two judges, a court commissioner, and a support staff.

The superior court is a court of general jurisdiction. Superior court hears civil cases exceeding $75,000 or requesting non-monetary remedies. Superior court hears all juvenile criminal cases and all adult felony cases. Superior court also hears appeals from district court and municipal courts. Superior court staff include three judges, three full-time court commissioners, two part-time court commissioners, and support staff. District and superior court judges are elected by the county voters for a term of four years. Court commissioners are appointed by elected judges; commissioners have powers and responsibilities equal to elected judges.

===Politics===
Whatcom County has been largely Democratic in presidential elections since 1988. Since 2004, the Democratic presidential candidates have received the majority of the county&#x27;s vote. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden handily won the county with just over 60% of the vote, as did Kamala Harris four years later.












===Cities and towns===
Incorporated cities and towns provide municipal services. Each city or town has an elected council and mayor.

===Special-purpose districts===
Special-purpose districts include cemetery, fire, hospital, library, school, and water and sewer districts. Each special district is governed by officials elected by voters within that jurisdiction.

====Fire districts====
Eleven fire districts, two city fire departments, and a regional fire authority provide fire prevention, fire fighting, and emergency medical services. Each fire district is governed by an elected board of commissioners. Most districts have three commissioners. Fire districts receive most of their revenue from property taxes. All of the fire districts and the regional fire authority have volunteer or paid-call firefighters and emergency medical technicians (EMTs), as does the City of Lynden Fire Department.

The City of Bellingham is an all-career department. Some of the districts also have full-time firefighter/EMTs. All fire districts use 9-1-1 for emergency calls. Whatcom County has one 9-1-1 call center located in Bellingham. Fire/EMS calls are processed and dispatched at a second public safety answering point called Prospect, located at a fire station in Bellingham. Additional dispatching locations provide backup capacity to answer emergency calls.

===Law enforcement===
The Whatcom County Sheriff&#x27;s Office is responsible for maintaining the county jail, providing security at the Whatcom County Superior Court, serving civil processes, coordinating emergency management among the county&#x27;s emergency services, and maintaining law and order in rural areas.

The first sheriff was Ellis &quot;Yankee&quot; Barnes who was sworn into office in 1854, during a period in which the border between the United States and British Columbia along Whatcom County had not been fully delineated. That year, Barnes seized and auctioned 34 rams that belonged to Canadian farmer Charles Griffin for Griffin&#x27;s failure to pay United States taxes. The event was one of several provocations that led to the Pig War between the United States and the United Kingdom.

In 1863 James Kavanaugh served as sheriff. Kavanaugh, who married Princess Tol Sol of the Swinomish tribe, had previously served as the first United States Marshal in the Pacific Northwest.

In 2005 the sheriff&#x27;s office reported 80 deputies and 53 corrections officers on staff.

==Economy==
Coal mines, a sawmill, and a military fort were established on Bellingham Bay in the 1850s. Logging was the principal economic activity at first, and agriculture developed as land was cleared by logging activity. Canneries, both of fish and crops, shipped the county&#x27;s products far and wide.

Pacific American Fisheries organized in 1899 in Fairhaven, and became the world&#x27;s largest canning operation, employing over 5,500 residents. Smaller canneries at Semiahmoo also produced 2,000 cases of canned salmon daily. The Fairhaven Shipyard constructed fleets of fishing ships, and also produced freighters during World War I.

Whatcom County has a large agricultural industry that dates back to the late 19th century, when communities transitioned from logging after the removal of forests in the Nooksack Valley. The county produces of raspberries annually, which constitutes 99 percent of Washington&#x27;s crop and typically around 85 percent of the entire U.S. raspberry harvest. The local dairy and egg industries also contribute to $200 million in annual sales; the county had an estimated 48,964 dairy cows in 2007.

Cross-border activity is also a significant driver of the economy.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
Whatcom County residents are served by public and private schools, providing preschool, primary (K-5), and secondary (6–12) education. Public schools are operated by eight school districts. Each school district is an independent local government managed by an elected school board. Seven districts serve the western portion of Whatcom County. One district serves the southeast corner of Whatcom County. The remaining portion of the county is national forest or national park land, which has no permanent residents.

These districts (including any with any portion in the county, even if the schools are not in the county) are:
* Bellingham School District serves Bellingham, Chuckanut, Lake Samish, and Sudden Valley.
* Blaine School District serves Blaine, Birch Bay, and Point Roberts.
* Concrete School District serves the county&#x27;s southeast corner, including Newhalem and Diablo.

<text>Wahkiakum County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,422, making it one of the least populous counties in Washington. The county seat and only incorporated town is Cathlamet. The county was formed out of Cowlitz County in April 1854 and is named for Chief Wahkiakum (&quot;Tall Timber&quot;) of the Chinook, who is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery in Cathlamet.

The county operates the Wahkiakum County Ferry, which connects Cathlamet to Westport, Oregon, across the Columbia River.

==History==
The region that became Wahkiakum County was home to the Wahkiakums, one of the Chinookan peoples. Archaeological investigation at Skamokawa indicated that the site, where the inhabitants engaged in fishing, hunting, wood-working, and tool manufacture, was approximately 2,300 years old. 

Merchant sea captain Robert Gray, on his Columbia River expedition in 1792, was the first American known to arrive in the area. During salmon season in the early 1800s, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company″s post at Fort George operated a salting station in the region. In 1844, the first trading post was established in the area, near Skamokawa. It was succeeded by Birnie&#x27;s Retreat, a trading post established in 1846 by James Birnie, who had previously worked for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The influence of his wife, Charlotte Beaulieu Birnie, whose parents were a French voyageur and a Kootenay tribe member, helped protect Cathlamet during the Puget Sound War.

Wahkiakum County, with Cathlamet as the county seat, was created by the First Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Washington in 1854.

Early settlers came from Great Britain and the eastern United States until around 1870, when they were followed by a large number of immigrants from Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Dalmatia. From 1870 to the early 1900s, there was a large population of Chinese residents who worked in the fish canneries. The total population in 1912 was 5,283. Lacking roads, travel between early communities was by foot or by boat. Numerous areas of population disappeared in the years after roads began to replace water transportation. 

Settlers engaged in fishing, logging, farming, and trading. Salmon canning began in 1866, quickly followed by the establishment of multiple canneries. In 1872, Chinese laborers were brought in to work in the canneries. Salmon canning over the years was impacted by overfishing and habitat degradation, with declines observed by 1889. The last salmon pack in Wahkiakum County took place in 1947.

As a densely wooded region, Wahkiakum County was an abundant source for logging companies. Logs were easily transported by water, although that transport relied on seasonal changes in freshets. When timber nearest the water had been felled, loggers had to rely on oxen, and then on railroads. The first logging train began operating in 1892, established by Simon Benson. 

Many trees were also felled by immigrants to clear land for farming. By 1912, there were approximately 140 farms in the region, primarily dairy farms. The first cooperative creamery on the west coast was organized in 1898 in Skamokawa. The first chapter in Wahkiakum County of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry was organized in 1901.

The earliest periodicals in the area included the &quot;Cathlamet Gazette&quot; (1889), the &quot;Skamokawa Eagle&quot; (1891) which continues to be the county&#x27;s official newspaper, and &quot;the Timberman&quot; (1899).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (8.3%) is water. It is the smallest county of Washington by total area and the third-smallest by land area, after San Juan County and Island County, which are mostly water by area.

<doc id="91062" wikidata="Q113773" url="?curid=91062" title="Thurston County, Washington">
<text>Thurston County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 294,793. The county seat is Olympia, the state capital.

Thurston County was created out of Lewis County by the government of Oregon Territory on January 12, 1852. At that time, it covered all of the Puget Sound region and the Olympic Peninsula. On December 22 of the same year, Pierce, King, Island, and Jefferson counties were split off from Thurston County. It is named after Samuel R. Thurston, the Oregon Territory&#x27;s first delegate to Congress.

Thurston County comprises the Olympia–Tumwater, WA Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Seattle–Tacoma, WA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

The southern end of Puget Sound is the homeland of several indigenous Coast Salish groups, including the Nisqually, Squaxin, and Upper Chehalis. Archeological remains at Tumwater Falls date back to 2,500 to 3,000 years before present; the area around the falls included a settlement with several longhouses. The first European exhibition to the southern Puget Sound was conducted by Peter Puget and Joseph Whidbey on the British-led Vancouver Expedition in May 1792. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a trading post at Fort Nisqually in 1833 on the east side of the Nisqually Delta while the Oregon Country was under joint administration by the British and American governments. Permanent European (and later American) settlement of modern-day Thurston County began with the arrival of a pioneer party led by Michael Simmons and George Bush in 1845. Several families settled near Tumwater Falls at a site they named &quot;New Market&quot;, which became the first European settlement in Western Washington.

The area north of the Columbia River was originally under the jurisdiction of the Vancouver District (later renamed Clark County) until 1845, when Lewis County was created from the area west of the Cowlitz River. The entire region was ceded to the United States with the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846 and organized into Oregon Territory two years later. A petition by 54 residents of Olympia and surrounding communities was submitted to the Oregon Territorial Legislature in December 1851 to create a new county from Lewis County. The proposed name of Simmons County, named for Michael Simmons, was changed to Thurston County by the legislature at the suggestion of Asa Lovejoy to honor Samuel Thurston, the first delegate to the U.S. Congress from Oregon Territory. Thurston himself had never visited the area.

Thurston County was created on January 12, 1852, by the Oregon Territorial Legislature and Olympia was designated as its seat. It included the entire Olympic Peninsula and Puget Sound region up to the northern border with British North America and went as far east as the Cascade Mountains. On December 22, the northern areas of Thurston County were divided to form Island, Jefferson, King, and Pierce counties. A portion of the county south of the Chehalis River was ceded to Lewis County in February 1853, a month before Washington Territory was created with its capital in Olympia. Sawamish County (now Mason County) was created in March 1854 from the northwestern portions of Thurston County and Chehalis County (now Grays Harbor County) was established a month later from the remaining western half of Thurston County. Several exchanges of land between Thurston and neighboring counties were made during the 1860s and settled into the modern boundaries by 1873. An attempt to move the county seat from Olympia to Tumwater or West Olympia was defeated by voters in 1861.

Olympia was retained as capital of Washington after it was granted statehood in 1889; the city did not win a majority in the first referendum after Ellensburg and North Yakima, but defeated both in a second vote. Local residents built a branch line to connect with the Northern Pacific Railroad and approved a harbor-dredging operation to promote Olympia as a trade hub as the area fell behind Seattle and Tacoma in population growth. The Thurston County Courthouse was completed in 1892 and was purchased by the state government in 1901 for use as the state capitol building to replace a temporary wooden structure built in 1856. The modern Washington State Capitol commenced construction in 1923 and was completed in 1928 alongside a campus of government buildings and monuments. Thurston County remained predominantly dependent on the logging industry until the state government became the county&#x27;s largest employment sector in the 1950s. Several state government agencies had attempted to move their offices to Seattle until a 1954 Washington Supreme Court ruling mandated that their headquarters remain in the Olympia area.

The first section of Interstate 5 built in Thurston County was the Olympia Freeway, which opened in December 1958 to bypass the city&#x27;s downtown. Other sections opened over the following decade, extending access through Lacey and Tumwater, where it destroyed portions of the historic downtown; a proposal to build the freeway further away from Olympia was rejected to preserve rural areas. The completion of Interstate 5 enabled the growth of bedroom communities around Thurston County, which saw its population rapidly increase from the 1950s to 1970s. The first suburban shopping center in the county, the South Sound Center in Lacey, opened in October 1966; it was followed by Lacey&#x27;s incorporation as a city. The Evergreen State College, a public liberal arts college in western Olympia, opened in 1972.

The census allows the county to coordinate with various local, state, and national agencies as an effort to combat homelessness.

==Government==

Thurston County is governed by a five-member board of county commissioners who are elected to four-year terms from proportional districts. The board of commissioners was enlarged from three members to five members in November 2023 following the approval of a ballot measure to expand the board that passed a year prior. The head of the Thurston County government&#x27;s administration is the county manager, who is appointed by the board of commissioners. Since 2024, the county manager has been Leonard Hernandez, who was previously the CEO of San Bernardino County, California. Thurston County has used its commissioner–manager form of government since it was formed in 1852. An attempt to adopt a home rule charter with an elected county executive and seven-member county council was rejected by voters in 1979.

The county is split between two U.S. congressional districts, which each elect a member to the United States House of Representatives: the 3rd district, generally south of State Route 507; and the 10th district, which includes the urban areas of Olympia, Lacey, and Tumwater, as well as Yelm. Until the creation of the 10th district following the 2010 U.S. census, Olympia and Lacey were in separate congressional districts. At the state level, Thurston County is part of five legislative districts that each elect a state senator and two state representatives. The 2nd district encompasses the rural southeast of the county; the 19th district includes Grand Mound and the southwest corner of the county; the 20th district includes an area east of Grand Mound; the 22nd district includes Olympia, Lacey, and Tumwater; and the 35th district encompasses western and central Thurston County.

===Special districts===
Special-purpose districts include cemetery, fire, hospital, library, school, and water and sewer districts. Each special district is governed by officials elected by voters within that jurisdiction.

====Fire districts====
Seven fire districts, three city fire departments, and two regional fire authorities provide fire prevention, fire fighting, and emergency medical services. Each fire district is governed by an elected board of commissioners. Most districts have three commissioners. Fire districts receive most of their revenue from property taxes. All of the fire districts and the regional fire authority have volunteer or paid-call firefighters and emergency medical technicians (EMTs).

The City of Olympia is an all-career department. Fire District 3 only allows volunteers to live within the City of Lacey city limits.

==Culture==

===Arts and music===

Indie label K Records and the Evergreen State College&#x27;s radio station KAOS, both founded by musician Calvin Johnson, brought many groups into the mainstream and wider success.

===Media===

The newspaper of record for Thurston County is &quot;The Olympian&quot;, a newspaper based in Olympia that is owned by the McClatchy Company and publishes three print editions per week. , it has a circulation of 17,401. &quot;The Olympian&quot; was founded in 1891 and merged with several local newspapers in the early 20th century to become the sole daily newspaper in the county. Earlier newspapers included &quot;The Columbian&quot;, founded in 1852, and &quot;The Washington Standard&quot;, which was published weekly from 1860 to 1921. As the state capital, Olympia formerly had bureaus for newspapers across the state, including the two dailies in Seattle, and several reporters from the Associated Press. By 2021, the Olympia bureaus had shrunk to only six reporters.

The county also has several weekly and online news publications. The &quot;Nisqually Valley News&quot;, founded in 1922, is published weekly in Yelm and has been a sister publication of &quot;The Chronicle&quot; of Centralia since 1994. Tenino had several competing newspapers during the 1910s that were succeeded by the &quot;Tenino Independent&quot;, which has been published weekly since 1922. An alt weekly, the &quot;Weekly Volcano&quot; was published in Olympia from 2001 to 2013; it was later revived in 2023. &quot;The Journal of Olympia, Lacey &amp; Tumwater&quot; (JOLT) is a non-profit online news organization that was founded in 2020.

===Libraries===

Thurston County is part of the Timberland Regional Library, a public library system that serves five counties in southwestern Washington and is headquartered in Tumwater. It has seven locations in the county and a dedicated bookmobile service. Thurston County is a founding member of the Timberland system, which was established as a pilot project in 1964 and made into a permanent intercounty rural library district in 1968. The county had previously been served by the South Puget Sound Regional Library, which was contracted to operate libraries in the cities of Lacey, Olympia, and Yelm. These cities were later annexed directly into the Timberland system by the 1980s. The oldest public library in the county was opened in 1896 by the Woman&#x27;s Club of Olympia, who donated their collection of 900 books to the city government in 1909. A permanent Carnegie library in Olympia was opened in 1914 with 1,500 books and was used by the city and Timberland until a new library building opened in 1978.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Thurston County is bisected by Interstate 5, the major north–south freeway on the U.S. West Coast that connects Washington, Oregon, and California. The freeway travels through Grand Mound, Tumwater, Olympia, and Lacey and continues south to Portland, Oregon, and north to Tacoma and Seattle. It was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s to replace U.S. Route 99, the original north–south highway in Western Washington. Interstate 5 intersects several other highways within Thurston County that provide connections to other areas of Washington state. These include U.S. Route 12, which travels west from Grand Mound to Aberdeen; U.S. Route 101, which encircles most of the Olympic Peninsula and provides access to Aberdeen via State Route 8; and State Route 510, which travels along the Nisqually River to Yelm, where it intersects State Route 507.

The county has two public transportation providers and connections to other systems that serve neighboring counties. Intercity Transit has 18 routes that serve the cities and urban growth areas of Olympia, Lacey, Tumwater, and Yelm. In addition to local service, the agency operates The One, a rapid bus service in Olympia and Lacey, and express buses to Lakewood that connect with Pierce Transit and Sound Transit. All routes in the Intercity Transit system have been fare-free since 2020; the agency is funded by a local sales tax within its service area, which was formed in 1980. Rural Transit is operated by the Thurston Regional Planning Council between communities south of Olympia and Tumwater. It is also fare-free and connects with Lewis County Transit in Centralia.

Passenger rail service through Thurston County is operated by Amtrak, which has two routes that serve Centennial Station in southern Lacey, which opened in 1993 and is primarily run by volunteers. The &quot;Cascades&quot; has several daily trips to Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver; the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; has one daily train that runs between Seattle, Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles. These routes run on tracks owned by the BNSF Railway, which primarily operates freight trains through the county on the Seattle Subdivision. Several branch railroads also pass through Thurston County, including the Puget Sound and Pacific Railroad and two lines owned by the Port of Olympia that were leased to Tacoma Rail until 2016.

The county has one public airport, Olympia Regional Airport, which is owned by the Port of Olympia and used for general aviation, business flights, air ambulances, and government use. It has two runways, a passenger terminal, and an air traffic control tower. The airport and two other sites in Thurston County were among candidates considered by a state legislative commission for a new passenger airport to relieve crowding at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, the main passenger airport in the region.

===Healthcare===

Thurston County has two major hospitals that have a combined 500-bed capacity. The largest is Providence St. Peter Hospital north of Lacey, which has 390 beds and is operated by Providence Health &amp; Services. It was founded in 1887 at a location in Olympia and moved to its current campus near Lacey in 1971. The Capital Medical Center in Olympia, operated by MultiCare Health since 2021, has 107 beds and an off-campus emergency room in Lacey. It was built in 1985 to address a shortage in hospital capacity in the South Puget Sound region.

<text>Spokane County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 539,339, making it the fourth-most populous county in Washington. The largest city and county seat is Spokane, the second largest city in the state after Seattle. The county is named after the Spokane people.

Spokane County is part of the Spokane metropolitan area, which is also part of the greater Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene combined statistical area that includes nearby Kootenai County, Idaho.

==History==
The first humans to arrive in what is now Spokane County arrived between 12,000 and 8,000 years ago and were hunter-gatherer societies who lived off the plentiful game in the area. Initially, the settlers hunted predominantly bison and antelope, but after the game migrated out of the region, the native people became dependent on gathering various roots, berries, and nuts, and harvesting fish. The Spokane tribe, after which the county is named, means &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; or &quot;sun people&quot; in Salishan Explorer-geographer David Thompson, working as head of the North West Company&#x27;s Columbia Department, became the first European to explore what is now the Inland Northwest. After establishing the Kullyspell House and Saleesh House fur trading posts in what are now Idaho and Montana, Thompson then attempted to expand further west. He sent out two trappers, Jacques Raphael Finlay and Finan McDonald, to construct a fur-trading post on the Spokane River in Washington and trade with the local Indians. This post was established in 1810, at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane Rivers, becoming the first enduring European settlement of significance in Washington. Known as the Spokane House, or simply &quot;Spokane&quot;, it was in operation from 1810 to 1826.

Spokane County was established by the Washington Territorial Legislature effective January 29, 1858, from a portion of Walla Walla County, which originally encompassed most of eastern Washington Territory between the Cascades and Rockies. The new county was bound to the west by the Columbia and Snake rivers and to the east by the Rockies; it included portions of modern-day Idaho and Montana. The territorial legislature designated the farm of Angus McLeod as the temporary county seat and appointed officials to several positions for Spokane County, but they never took office and did not organize a government. In late 1859, a group of settlers in the Bitterroot Valley petitioned to create their own county, which was not granted at that time; the territorial legislature reorganized Spokane County on January 17, 1860, with a seat on a land claim near Fort Colville.

The first county government met on May 8, 1860, and began conducting business. The eastern and southern portions of Spokane County were partitioned several times as new counties were created, beginning with Missoula County in December 1860 and followed by Shoshone County and Nez Perce County in 1861. These areas became part of the new Idaho Territory, which was organized by the U.S. Congress on March 3, 1863, and reduced the size of Spokane County even further. On January 19, 1864, the county was annexed into neighboring Stevens County, which had been created a year earlier from the northern portions of Walla Walla County. The seat of Stevens County was Pinkney City (now Colville) until it was temporarily relocated to the town of Spokane Falls (now Spokane) in 1875.

Spokane County was re-established on October 30, 1879, from the portions of Stevens County south of the Columbia, Spokane, and Wenatchee rivers. The western portion of the county was used to create Lincoln County, which was established on November 23, 1883. The first post office in the county was located at Spokane Bridge.

The selection of a permanent county seat was to be decided in an election in November 1880 between the growing cities of Cheney and Spokane Falls, both candidates for a major Northern Pacific Railway hub. The unofficial returns showed a 14-vote margin in favor of Cheney, but the result was disputed by county officials from Spokane Falls based on &quot;irregularities&quot; in the ballots. The official result had a margin of two or three votes for Spokane Falls, but Cheney residents demanded a recount, which was granted by a court order that was ignored by county officials in Spokane Falls. On March 21, 1881, a group of armed Cheney residents forcibly took custody of the county auditor, recount ballots, and other county records during a nighttime raid. After declaring their own recount had been in favor of Cheney as county seat, the records and the county auditor were moved from Spokane Falls; other government officials also moved to Cheney after a court order upheld the Cheney recount. A new ballot question in 1886 resulted in Spokane becoming the permanent county seat.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (0.9%) are covered by water. The lowest point in the county is the Spokane River behind Long Lake Dam (boundary of Stevens County) at above sea level. (Virtually no change in elevation occurs between the dam and the mouth of the Little Spokane River inside Riverside State Park.) The highest point in the county is the summit of Mount Spokane at .

Spokane County has a complex geologic history and varied topography. To the west is the barren landscape of the Columbia Basin and to the east are the foothills of the Rockies—the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains, which rise to the east in northern Idaho. Spokane County lies in a transition area between the eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe plains to the west and the rugged, timbered Rocky Mountain foothills to the east. The area exhibits signs of the prehistoric geologic events that shaped the area and region such as the Missoula Floods, which ended 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The geography to the southeast, such as the Saltese Flats and Saltese Uplands is characterized as a shrub–steppe landscape with grassy hills and ravines.

In ecology, as with the topography, the county is also in a transition area, roughly split between the Columbia Plateau ecoregion in the southwest portion, where it is at the eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe plain and the Northern Rockies ecoregion in the northwest portion, which is the rugged and forested Selkirk Mountains.

==Law and government==
Spokane County is governed by a partisan board of county commissioners, one from each of five districts. They run in a partisan primary election within their own district, then compete countywide in the general election. Other elected officials include the sheriff, auditor (who is also responsible for elections), assessor, treasurer, and prosecutor, which are also partisan offices. Spokane County has an appointed medical examiner. In 2023, Spokane County expanded the number of County Commissioner seats from 3 to 5. As of January 2023, the current commissioners for Spokane County are Chris Jordan (Democrat), Amber Waldref (Democrat), Josh Kerns (Republican), Mary Kuney (Republican), and Al French (Republican), from the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth county districts, respectively. The previous Sheriff was Ozzie D. Knezovich, who was appointed on April 11, 2006, and retired on December 31, 2022. The current elected Sheriff of Spokane County is John Nowels, whose term began on January 1, 2023.

Transportation planning within the county is handled by the Spokane Regional Transportation Council, a metropolitan planning organization that was created in 1962. It distributes federal and state funds for transportation projects and updates the long-range transportation plan for Spokane County.
==Politics==
Spokane County is rather conservative for an urban county, voting Republican for president all but three times since 1948. Democratic strength is concentrated in Spokane itself and in Cheney, which is home to Eastern Washington University, while the suburban areas are heavily Republican. The Republican edge has narrowed somewhat since the turn of the century. In the last five elections, the margin has been under 9% each time.

The county was one of two in Eastern Washington to vote for 2018 Washington Initiative 1639, which strengthened gun laws, along with neighboring Whitman County.












===Flag and symbols===

The county government adopted an official flag in 1988 following a public design contest sponsored by the Spokane County Centennial Commission. The winning entry from Stephanie Bumgarner-Ott, the daughter of state legislator Gary Bumgarner, depicts the ceremonial headdress of the Spokane people against a yellow sun; the background is green with a diagonal blue stripe to represent the Spokane River. The flag was sent for display at the Washington State Capitol for the state centennial in 1989 and 25 copies were made at a cost of $1,751.75; it was used for official events, including the funeral of a county commissioner, but was not on permanent display in Spokane County buildings. One copy of the flag was stored in a vault in the county courthouse until 1995 and later lost again. The county government announced plans to decommission the design in 2002 and hold a new public contest due to the original flag&#x27;s appearance, which was deemed potentially offensive to Native Americans. A new county seal was adopted in 2005 that depicts the county courthouse.

<text>Skamania County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,036. The county seat and largest incorporated city is Stevenson, although the Carson River Valley CDP is more populous. Skamania County is included in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Etymology===
The county was founded in 1854 and derives its name from the Cascades Chinook word &quot;sk&#x27;mániak&quot;, meaning &#x27;swift waters&#x27;.

===County beginnings===
The area delineated by the future Washington state boundary began to be colonized at the start of the nineteenth century, both by Americans and British subjects. However, the majority of British exploration and interest in the land was due to the fur trade, whereas American settlers were principally seeking land for agriculture and cattle raising. The Treaty of 1818 provided for the region to be an Anglo-American condominium. During this period, the future Washington Territory was divided into two administrative zones: Clarke County (now Clark County) and Lewis County (made official in 1845).

The condominium was unwieldy and led to continual argument, and occasional conflict. The status of the Washington area was settled in 1846, when the Oregon Treaty ceded the land south of North latitude 49 degrees to American control.

On March 9, 1854, Skamania County was split from the original Clarke County and stretched east to the Rocky Mountains in present-day Montana. Walla Walla County was split from the portions of Skamania County east of the Deschutes River on April 24. The county lost its eastern edge during the creation of Klickitat County in 1861.

The territorial legislature dissolved Skamania County and divided its land between Clarke and Klickitat counties in January 1865 during a taxing dispute with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The dissolution was repealed in 1867 after intervention from the U.S. Congress. After that, Skamania County retained its shape, including through the period after Washington became the 42nd state of the Union in 1889. Fort Cascades, built to protect the Columbia River, served as an early county seat, but the county seat has been in Stevenson since 1893.

===20th century to present day===
Skamania County is also known for enacting what has been described as the &quot;Bigfoot Ordinance&quot;, passed by the Board of County Commissioners at its meeting of April 1, 1969, and published twice in the &quot;Skamania County Pioneer&quot;, the newspaper of highest circulation in the county, as required by law. The ordinance forbids the slaying of any &quot;nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an ape-like creature or a sub-species of Homo sapiens ... generally and commonly known as a &#x27;Sasquatch&#x27;, &#x27;Yeti&#x27;, &#x27;Bigfoot&#x27;, or &#x27;Giant Hairy ape&#x27;&quot;, subject to a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and five years imprisonment. Although its passage coincided with April Fool&#x27;s Day, Ordinance 69-01 was real, was amended in 1984, and has not been repealed. Its purposes included protection of residents and visitors from in the county from a very real concern, &quot;an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters, many armed with lethal weapons&quot;, who had been attracted to the area by reported sightings of a creature.

Mt. St. Helens, which is located in Skamania County, erupted in 1980.

<doc id="91066" wikidata="Q110403" url="?curid=91066" title="Snohomish County, Washington">
<text>Snohomish County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. With a population of 827,957 as of the 2020 census, it is the third-most populous county in Washington, after nearby King and Pierce counties, and the 72nd-most populous in the United States. The county seat and largest city is Everett. The county forms part of the Seattle metropolitan area, which also includes King and Pierce counties to the south.

The county&#x27;s western portion, facing Puget Sound and other inland waters of the Salish Sea, is home to the majority of its population and major cities. The eastern portion is rugged and includes portions of the Cascade Range, with few settlements along major rivers and most of it designated as part of the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest. Snohomish County is bound to the north by Skagit County, to the east by Chelan County, to the south by King County, and to the west by Kitsap and Island counties.

Snohomish County was created from a portion of Island County on January 14, 1861, and is named for the indigenous Snohomish people. It includes the Tulalip Indian Reservation, which was established by the 1855 Point Elliott Treaty, by which several indigenous Coast Salish groups were required to cede their lands and relocate to the reservation. The county seat was originally at the city of Snohomish. An 1897 election moved it to Everett. Since the mid-20th century, areas of Snohomish County have developed into an aerospace manufacturing center, largely due to the presence of Boeing in Everett. There are also bedroom communities for people who work in Seattle.

Snohomish County now has 18 incorporated cities and two towns with their own local governments, in addition to developed unincorporated areas. It is connected to nearby areas by roads (including Interstate 5), railways, and transit systems. The county government is led by a five-member county council and chief executive, all elected by voters to four-year terms.

==Etymology==

&quot;Snohomish&quot; comes from the name of what was the largest Native American tribe in the area when European-American settlers arrived in the 19th century. The name is spelled &quot;Sduhubš&quot; (Sdoh-doh-hohbsh) in the Lushootseed language and its meaning is disputed with unclear origins. Federal Indian agent Dr. Charles M. Buchanan, who spent 21 years with the Tulalip, once said that he had &quot;never met an Indian who could give a meaning to the word Snohomish&quot;. Chief William Shelton, the last hereditary tribal chief of the Snohomish tribe, claimed that it meant &quot;lowland people&quot;, a name associated with the tribe&#x27;s location on the waters of the Puget Sound. Other scholars have claimed it meant &quot;a style of union among them&quot;, &quot;the braves&quot;, or &quot;Sleeping Waters&quot;.

The name is also used for the Snohomish River, which runs through part of the county, and the City of Snohomish, the former county seat that was renamed after the formation of the county. The current spelling of the name was adopted by the Surveyor General of Washington Territory in 1857, replacing alternative spellings used in some earlier documents and accounts. John Work of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company recorded the name as &quot;Sinnahmis&quot; in 1824, while the Wilkes Expedition of 1841 used &quot;Tuxpam&quot; to describe the Snohomish River. The same river was named &quot;Sinahomis&quot; by Captain Henry Kellett in 1847, and was accepted in that spelling by the U.S. government for several years.

==History==
Snohomish County was originally inhabited by several Coast Salish groups, predominantly settled along the western coastline and near the region&#x27;s rivers. The Snohomish were the largest group and occupied an area from present-day Warm Beach to Shoreline, while Stillaguamish lived in the Stillaguamish River basin. The region was first charted and named by European explorers in the late 18th century, beginning with Captain George Vancouver and his British expedition. Vancouver arrived in Puget Sound and Port Gardner Bay on June 4, 1792, landing near present-day Everett.

The Treaty of Point Elliott was signed at present-day Mukilteo on January 22, 1855, marking the cession of Coast Salish territories in the Puget Sound lowlands. The Tulalip Indian Reservation was established to house the remaining tribes, including the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, and Skykomish. Snohomish County was created out of Island County&#x27;s mainland areas and the northernmost portion of King County on January 14, 1861. The separation from Island County was the result of a petition by settlers to the territorial legislature that cited the difficulty of travel to Coupeville on Whidbey Island, the county seat at the time.

The new county was the first in Washington to have its boundaries defined by a land survey rather than natural boundaries. The territorial legislature designated Mukilteo, the area&#x27;s largest settlement, as the temporary county seat in January 1861. The county government was permanently moved to Cadyville, later Snohomish, following an election on July 8. Residents north of the Snohomish River later proposed to be moved into Skagit County due to difficult travel to the county seat at Snohomish. After the incorporation of the city of Everett in 1893, the city&#x27;s leaders attempted to move the county seat from Snohomish. A countywide general election on November 6, 1894, chose to relocate the county seat to Everett, amid controversy and allegations of illegal votes. After two years of litigation between the cities of Snohomish and Everett, the county seat was officially relocated to Everett in December 1896.

One of the first county censuses was taken in 1862 by Sheriff Salem A. Woods. Early important pioneers in the Snohomish County region included E. F. Cady of Snohomish, Emory C. Ferguson of Snohomish and Isaac Cathcart.

The early economy of Snohomish County relied on natural resources, namely timber and mining, alongside agriculture. The region was connected by railroads at the end of the 19th century, which also created new towns that experienced major population booms as emigrants arrived from other parts of the United States. The county was among the largest New Deal aid beneficiaries in Washington due to its troubled economy during the Great Depression; the Works Progress Administration built major projects around Snohomish County, while the Civilian Conservation Corps developed wilderness and recreational areas around several work camps.

During World War II, the county had several shipyards and airplane factories established to supply the United States Armed Forces. Several existing and new airfields were converted into military use, which would continue beyond the war. A post-war population boom brought new suburban development to Snohomish County, where bedroom communities were built alongside new highways to Seattle. In 1967, Boeing began construction of an aircraft assembly plant—the world&#x27;s largest building—in Everett for its Boeing 747 program. The U.S. Navy located a major homeport in Everett that opened in 1994.

==Geography==
Snohomish County is part of the Puget Sound region of Western Washington, bordered to the south by King County, to the west by Puget Sound and other inland waters, to the north by Skagit County, and to the east by the Chelan County at the crest of the Cascade Range. According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total square area of approximately , of which is land and , or 5.0%, is water. It is the 13th largest county in Washington by land area and is larger than the states of Delaware and Rhode Island.

The county&#x27;s surface is covered by plains and rolling hills in the west, where the majority of settlements are, and mountainous terrain in the east. The Cascade Range passes through the eastern part of the county and is largely protected from development as part of the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain range includes the highest point in Snohomish County: Glacier Peak, at above sea level. Several major rivers originate in the Cascades and flow west towards Puget Sound and other parts of the Salish Sea, including the Stillaguamish and Snohomish (fed by the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers). These rivers form several valleys used for agriculture that occasionally flood during major weather events, such as atmospheric rivers.

===Climate===

The lowland areas of western Snohomish County generally has a temperate Mediterranean climate similar to the rest of the central Puget Sound region with dry summers and wet winters. The county&#x27;s weather is heavily influenced by maritime systems, pushed by prevailing westerly winds but dampened by the Olympic Mountains. The mean monthly temperatures for the county range from during the winter and in the summer.

==Law and government==

Snohomish County is a home rule charter county with three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The county government&#x27;s powers and structure is defined by a charter that is updated every 10 years with amendments that are presented to voters for approval. The county executive and council seats are partisan positions with four-year terms; other positions elected by voters are generally non-partisan. Most county offices have a term limit of three terms.

===County Executive===
The county executive is Dave Somers, a Democrat. Somers is a former Snohomish County Councilmember and took office as county executive on January 4, 2016, having won the seat from incumbent and fellow Democrat John Lovick.

The county executive seat was chartered in the 1979. The first county executive was conservative Democrat Willis Tucker of Snohomish from 1980 to 1992. Following Tucker, the next county executive was Democrat Bob Drewel from 1992 to 2004, followed by Democrat Aaron Reardon from 2004 to 2013. Reardon resigned on May 31, 2013, amid a series of political scandals, and was replaced by former Snohomish County Sheriff and state legislator John Lovick for the remainder of his term.

===County Council===
The county council has five members who are elected to four-year terms, each representing a geographical district that is redrawn every 10 years. , its members are:
* Nate Nehring (R) – district 1
* Megan Dunn (D) – district 2
* Strom Peterson (D) – district 3
* Jared Mead (D) – district 4
* Sam Low (R) – district 5

===Courts===

The judicial branch of the county government is divided between two courts: the Superior Court and District Court. The number of judges in each court is set by the state legislature as recommended by a panel of judges and analysis of the courts. The Superior Court has 17 judges elected to four-year terms and primarily handle major cases, including those that involve felonies and juveniles, as well as some civil cases. The District Court has nine judges that handle infractions, small claims, and domestic violence; it is divided into four geographical divisions.

===Politics===
Snohomish County has been a reliably Democratic county in recent presidential elections (albeit to a lesser degree than neighboring King County and Seattle). It has voted Democratic all but four times since 1932, with those four occasions being national Republican landslides in which the GOP candidate won over 400 electoral votes. It has not voted for a Republican since George H. W. Bush in 1988.

The county&#x27;s primary elections were historically held in June, but were moved to August in 2008. In the years since, turnout has been under 45% except for 2020; during odd-numbered years with municipal and local races, turnout has been under 27%.












==Education==
Snohomish County has 15 school districts that provide public K–12 education to over 100,000 pupils across the county as of the 2022–23 school year. The number of school districts in the county has declined as consolidations have eliminated smaller rural ones; the remaining rural districts have seen growth since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020 while enrollment in urban and suburban districts declined. The largest school district in Snohomish County is the Edmonds School District, followed closely by the Everett School District; both have an enrollment of over 20,000 students. The smallest district is the Index School District, which had 21 enrolled students in 2022–23 and does not have its own high school. Snohomish County also had 68 private schools in 2018, of which many were affiliated with religious organizations or offered alternative education methods.

The county has 15 colleges and university programs that provide post-secondary education. Three community colleges serve students in Snohomish County and offer two-year degrees and other programs: as of the 2023–24 school year, Cascadia College in Bothell has 1,826 enrolled students; Edmonds College in Lynnwood has 5,159 enrolled students; and Everett Community College in North Everett has 5,301 enrolled students. Everett was established in 1941 and is the oldest community college in the county; it was followed in 1967 by Edmonds and 1994 by Cascadia. The county also hosts off-site campuses for other institutions: the Northwest Indian College has a branch campus on the Tulalip Indian Reservation; and Columbia College has classes at Naval Station Everett&#x27;s support complex in Marysville.

Washington State University (WSU), a major public university, opened their Everett campus in 2017. The campus is co-located with Everett Community College and the Everett University Center, which was transferred to WSU control in 2012 and offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs for regional universities. Snohomish County had previously been one of the most populous counties in the U.S. without a post-secondary institute that offered four-year baccalaureate and advanced degree programs. The Seattle-based University of Washington (UW) had previously accepted a 2007 proposal from the state legislature to study and develop a branch campus in the county. UW selected finalist sites in Everett and Marysville, but halted further planning in 2008 due to the state government&#x27;s inability to fund the $800million project. Local officials approached WSU in 2011 with a proposal to gradually develop an Everett campus, which was authorized by the state legislature after UW backed out.

UW also has a Bothell campus that it shares with Cascadia College and was established in 1990 and underwent major growth in the 2010s. The Bothell campus draws up to 30 percent of its students from Snohomish County. Since 1975, Edmonds College has been the host of the Lynnwood branch of Central Washington University, which offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees for transferring students. The branch moved into Snoqualmie Hall, a dedicated building on the Edmonds College campus, in 2002. Edmonds College launched the first of its four-year Bachelor of Applied Science degree programs in 2017.

==Media==
Residents receive much of their information from Seattle-based media, the most prominent of which include &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; and regional TV news stations. &quot;The Everett Herald&quot; is the county&#x27;s most popular daily newspaper, while weekly newspapers such as the &quot;Snohomish County Tribune, Stanwood Camano News and Edmonds Beacon&quot; serve their respective communities.

The county is part of the Seattle broadcast television market and is served by several regional television news stations, including KOMO, KING, KIRO, KCTS, and KCPQ.

Local radio stations based in the county include KKXA, KRKO, KSER, and KWYZ.

There are also smaller local publications, with significant online presences: &quot;My Edmonds News&quot;, &quot;My Everett News&quot;, &quot;The Mountlake Terrace News&quot;, &quot;News of Mill Creek&quot;, &quot;Mill Creek View, Lynnwood Today&quot; and &quot;Lynnwood Times.&quot;

The county has been used as a filming location for several movies and television series since the mid-20th century.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

Snohomish County has two Interstate Highways, one U.S. route, and several state routes that connect it to other areas. The county&#x27;s main highway is Interstate 5 (I-5), which runs north–south for and travels through several major cities. Other major routes are primarily north–south routes, including State Route 9 on the east side of the urbanized area; State Route 99 to the west of I-5; and State Route 527 in Mill Creek and Bothell.

The countywide numbered street grid originates in Everett and was implemented beginning in the 1970s during the rollout of the 911 emergency phone number system. By the late 1990s, some roads had reverted to their historical names—either officially or by using commemorative signs—due to local backlash.

===Public transportation===

Snohomish County is served by several public transit systems that connect to each other at regional hubs, including Everett Station and Lynnwood Transit Center. The primary provider is Community Transit, which operates local service within the county (apart from the city of Everett) and commuter service to the Boeing Everett Factory and Downtown Seattle. Sound Transit, a regional transit agency, provides light rail, commuter rail, and express bus services that connect to regional destinations in Seattle and Bellevue. Other providers include Everett Transit, a municipal system serving the city of Everett; Island Transit, which connects Camano Island to Stanwood and Everett; and Skagit Transit, which operates an inter-county route from Everett to Mount Vernon.

The regional Link light rail system was extended into Snohomish County with the opening of the Lynnwood Link Extension on August 30, 2024, which includes stations in Mountlake Terrace and Lynnwood on the 1 Line. The project was approved in a 2008 ballot measure and began construction in 2019. An extension to Everett with six or seven stations was approved in the regional Sound Transit 3 ballot measure in 2016 and is expected to open between 2037 and 2041. Community Transit operates a bus rapid transit network called Swift with three lines : the Blue Line, which opened in 2009 from Everett to Shoreline along State Route 99; the Green Line from the Boeing Everett Factory to Bothell via Airport Road and State Route 527; and the Orange Line in Lynnwood and Mill Creek, which opened in 2024. A fourth line, the Gold Line, is planned to open by 2029 and connect Everett to Marysville and Smokey Point.

Sound Transit also runs four daily Sounder commuter trains at peak hours between Everett Station and King Street Station in Seattle, stopping at Mukilteo and Edmonds. Intercity rail service is provided by Amtrak, which has two lines operating within Snohomish County: &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, stopping in Edmonds, Everett, and Stanwood station; and the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; between Seattle and Chicago, Illinois, stopping in Edmonds and Everett. Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines and Northwestern Trailways from Everett Station.

===Airports===
Snohomish County has one major airport: Paine Field, otherwise known as Snohomish County Airport, which has had passenger service since March 2019.

There are three smaller public airports that are open to general aviation: Arlington Municipal Airport in Arlington, Darrington Municipal Airport in Darrington, and Harvey Field in Snohomish. The county also has several private airports, including the Frontier Airpark and Green Valley Airfield in Granite Falls. The Martha Lake Airport in Martha Lake was a former private airport that was closed in 2000 and was converted into a county park that opened in 2010.

===Ferries===
Snohomish County is also connected to adjacent counties by two ferry routes operated by Washington State Ferries. The Edmonds–Kingston ferry carries SR 104 between Edmonds and Kingston in Kitsap County. The Mukilteo–Clinton ferry carries SR 525 from Mukilteo to Clinton on Whidbey Island.

==Government==
Skagit County&#x27;s government is headed by three commissioners, in the system laid out in the state constitution for all counties without charters. Commissioners are &quot;nominated&quot; in the primary by their district, but then are elected in the general by a county-wide vote. Commissioners are therefore said to represent the entire county, and not just their district. The most recent election was on November 5, 2024.

The current Skagit County commissioners include Lisa Janicki, a Democrat from District 3, which encompasses Burlington east of Interstate 5, Sedro-Woolley, and the rest of eastern Skagit County; Peter Browning, an independent from District 2, which covers Mount Vernon, Conway, and south county; and Ron Wesen, a Republican from District 1, which includes Anacortes, La Conner, and that area of the county west of Interstate 5 and north of McLean Road.

==Politics==
Skagit County had been a bellwether county since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, voting for the winning candidate in each subsequent presidential election until it was carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 (though only by a plurality). This democratic trend continued, with Skagit County voting for Kamala Harris in 2024 despite a nationwide rightward trend.












==County conservation efforts==
In 2006, the Skagit County Marine Resources Committee commissioned a study to evaluate establishing one or more no-take marine reserves to protect rockfish and other groundfish from overfishing.

==Transportation==
Skagit Transit provides the county with bus service. It also offers connections to Everett, Bellingham, Whidbey Island and Camano Island, and operates the Guemes Island ferry linking Anacortes to Guemes Island.

<text>San Juan County is a county in the Salish Sea in the far northwestern corner of the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, its population was 17,788. The county seat and only incorporated town is Friday Harbor, on San Juan Island. The county was formed on October 31, 1873, from Whatcom County and is named for the San Juan Islands, which are in turn named for Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the Viceroy of New Spain.

Although the islands have no state highways, the ferry routes serving them are designated as part of the state highway system.

==History==
The San Juan Islands were the subject of a territorial dispute between Great Britain and the United States from 1846 to 1872, leading to the Pig War in 1859. The bloodless conflict ended through arbitration led by Kaiser Wilhelm I, which awarded the islands to the United States. San Juan County was home to Henry Cayou, one of the first elected officials of Native descent in Washington.

On the 7th of June 2024, a T-34 plane flown by former astronaut and Air Force pilot William Anders crashed on the San Juan Islands. Anders did not survive the crash.

===Religion===
According to a 2020 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, San Juan County has the highest concentration of religiously unaffiliated people of any county in the United States. The unaffiliated make up 49% of the population.

==Law enforcement==
The San Juan County Sheriff&#x27;s Office is responsible for maintaining the county jail, providing security at the San Juan County Superior Court, serving civil processes, coordinating emergency management among the county&#x27;s emergency services, and maintaining law and order throughout the county, as there are no municipal police departments in San Juan County. Due to San Juan County&#x27;s island geography, the sheriff also operates a robust marine unit equipped with four small patrol craft, used for search and rescue and for transporting deputies and prisoners to and from remote islands. The sheriff has a mutual aid agreement with the National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers assigned to the San Juan Island National Historical Park and, in the event of an exigency, can also request assistance from the Washington State Patrol&#x27;s District 7 field detachment.

The county&#x27;s first sheriff was Stephen Boyce, who was known among area Native Americans as &quot;Hyas Tyee&quot; (&quot;great and powerful man&quot; in the Coast Salish language). Boyce helped investigate the sensational &quot;Kanaka Joe&quot; murders of 1873, and supervised the hanging of Joe &quot;Kanaka Joe&quot; Nuanna.
==Government and politics==













The county has voted heavily Democratic in presidential elections since the 1990s. The only area of the county won by George W. Bush in 2004 was the Decatur Island/Blakely Island precinct, with just over 50 votes. Waldron Island&#x27;s precinct voted 96.5% for John Kerry. In 2006, Maria Cantwell, the Democrat running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, won all precincts. The county&#x27;s legislative body is the San Juan County Council, which was created in 2006.

The county government adopted a 32-hour workweek for its approximately 160 employees in August 2023 to address chronic vacancies and the difficulty of the island lifestyle; the lone exception was the county sheriff&#x27;s office. Benefits and overall pay were retained through a deal with the employees&#x27; union by raising the hourly wage. In the first nine months under the policy, vacancies were filled faster and fewer sick days were used by employees.

==Transportation==
San Juan County is connected to the rest of Washington by the state ferry system, which operates the Anacortes–San Juan Islands ferry. The ferry&#x27;s runs include inter-island service as well as bypass runs that only serve Friday Harbor and Anacortes. It also includes service to Sidney, British Columbia, which was suspended in 2020. Due to high demand, vehicle spaces on the ferry runs generally require reservations during the summer months.

A public transit system, named San Juan Transit, was established in 1993 and primarily operates buses on San Juan Island for residents and visitors.

<doc id="91069" wikidata="Q156459" url="?curid=91069" title="Pierce County, Washington">
<text>Pierce County is a county in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 921,130, up from 795,225 in 2010, making it the second-most populous county in Washington, behind King County, and the 59th-most populous in the United States. The county seat and largest city is Tacoma. Formed out of Thurston County on December 22, 1852, by the legislature of Oregon Territory, it was named for U.S. President Franklin Pierce. Pierce County is in the Seattle metropolitan area (formally the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA, metropolitan statistical area).

Pierce County is home to the volcano Mount Rainier, the tallest mountain in the Cascade Range. Its most recent recorded eruption was between 1820 and 1854. There is no imminent risk of eruption, but geologists expect that the volcano will erupt again. If this should happen, parts of Pierce County and the Puyallup Valley would be at risk from lahars, lava, or pyroclastic flows. The Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System was established in 1998 to assist in the evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in case of eruption.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (7.6%) is water. The highest natural point in Washington, Mount Rainier, at , is located in Pierce County. Rainier is locally called Tahoma or Takhoma, both native names for the mountain.

==History==
The area was originally home to the present-day Nisqually, Puyallup, Squaxin, Steilacoom, and Muckleshoot tribes. The majority of Puyallup villages were situated in proximity to the area that would eventually develop into Tacoma, while Nisqually settlements were primarily located in what is now southern Pierce County. The tribes had two main routes: a northern path traversing Naches Pass and a southern route following the Mashel River, which connected them to Eastern Washington tribes. Trade networks among the region&#x27;s indigenous peoples were well-established long before the arrival of white settlers.

In 1792 British Captain George Vancouver and his party of explorers came via ship to the shores of the region, and named a number of sites in what would become Pierce County, i.e. Mt. Rainier.

In 1832 Fort Nisqually was sited by the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s chief trader, Archibald McDonald. It was the first permanent European settlement on the Salish Sea. In cooperation with the local indigenous people, a storehouse for blankets, seeds, and potatoes was built at the mouth of Sequalitchew Creek.

In 1839 the Nisqually Methodist Episcopal Mission was established, bringing the first U.S. citizens to settle in the Puget Sound region, near the Sequalitchew Creek canyon.

In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition set up an observatory on the bluff near the creek to survey, map and chart the waters of Puget Sound.

In 1843 the Second Fort Nisqually was erected. Business became mainly agricultural, and the fort was relocated on a flat-plains area near the banks of Sequalitchew Creek for cattle.
The Fort Nisqually property was turned over to American control in 1859.

In 1846 the Oregon Treaty established the 49th Parallel as the boundary between British Canada and the United States, which left what was to become Pierce County on U.S. territory. In response to increasing tensions between Indians and settlers, the United States Army established Fort Steilacoom in 1849 at the site of the traditional home of the Steilacoom Tribe.

In 1850, Captain Lafayette Balch sited his land claim next to the fort and founded Port Steilacoom. In 1854 the town of Steilacoom became Washington Territory&#x27;s first incorporated town.

In 1854 the Treaty of Medicine Creek was enacted between the United States and the local tribes occupying the lands of the Salish Sea. The tribes listed on the Treaty of Medicine Creek are Nisqually, Puyallup, Steilacoom, Squawskin (Squaxin Island), S&#x27;Homamish, Stehchass, T&#x27;Peeksin, Squi-aitl, and Sa-heh-wamish. The treaty was signed on December 26, 1854, by Isaac I. Stevens, governor and superintendent of Indian Affairs of Washington territory at the time. The native tribes were told the treaty would help them by paying them for some of the land. It ended up taking prime farmland and relocating the tribes onto rough reservations. Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe protested the treaty. He and his people marched to Olympia to have their voices heard but Isaac Stevens ordered them away. When the natives refused to leave, Isaac Stevens would eventually call martial law and - after the beginning of the Puget Sound War in 1855 - initiate a search for Chief Leschi in order to arrest him. Chief Leschi was eventually captured and put on trial. The first jury couldn&#x27;t come to a verdict, so Isaac Stevens had the trial done a second time. This time Leschi was found guilty. Chief Leschi was hanged on February 19, 1858. On December 10, 2004, a historical court convened in Pierce County ruled &quot;as a legal combatant of the Indian War Leschi should not have been held accountable under law for the death of an enemy soldier,&quot; thereby exonerating him of any wrongdoing.

==Government==

Pierce County has adopted and is governed by a Charter. This is allowed by section 4 of Article XI of the Washington State Constitution. The Pierce County Executive, currently Ryan Mello (D), heads the county&#x27;s executive branch. The Assessor-Treasurer Marty Campbell, auditor Linda Farmer, Prosecuting Attorney Mary Robnett, and Sheriff Keith Swank.

The Pierce County Council is the elected legislative body for Pierce County and consists of seven members elected by district. The council is vested with all law-making power granted by its charter and by the State of Washington, sets county policy through the adoption of ordinances and resolutions, approves the annual budget and directs the use of county funds. The seven members of the County Council are elected from each of seven contiguous and equally populated districts, with each councilmember representing approximately 114,000 county residents. Each county councilmember is elected to serve a four-year term.

* Dave Morell (R), District 1
* Paul Herrera (R), District 2
* Amy Cruver (R), District 3
* Rosie Ayala (D), District 4
* Bryan Yambe (D), District 5
* Jani Hitchen (D), District 6
* Robyn Denson (D), District 7

Beneath the Washington Supreme Court and the Washington Court of Appeals, judicial power rests first in the Pierce County Superior Court, which is divided into 23 departments - each headed by an elected judge, as well as a clerk of the superior court and nine superior court commissioners. Below that is the Pierce County District Court - with eight elected judges, the Tacoma Municipal Court - with three elected judges, and the Pierce County Juvenile Court. Tacoma houses the Pierce County Courthouse.

The people of Pierce County voted on November 5, 1918, to create a Port District. The Port of Tacoma is Pierce County&#x27;s only Port District. It is governed Port of Tacoma Commission - five Port Commissioners, who are elected at-large countywide and serve four-year terms. The Port of Tacoma owns six container terminals, one grain terminal and an auto import terminal; all of which are leased out to foreign and domestic corporations to operate. In addition, the port owns and operates two breakbulk cargo terminals.

Many charter amendments have been on the ballot in the last five years, but sequential numbering does not carry over from year-to-year.

==Politics==
Pierce County is split between three U.S. congressional districts:
* Washington&#x27;s 6th congressional district includes the city of Tacoma west of Washington State Route 7, Gig Harbor, and the Key Peninsula. The 6th district has been represented since 2025 by Emily Randall, a (Democrat).
* Washington&#x27;s 8th congressional district covers the eastern half of the county, from Bonney Lake east to Mt. Rainier. The 8th district has been represented since 2019 by Kim Schrier, a (Democrat).
* Washington&#x27;s 10th congressional district, contains much of the territory in Pierce County lost by the 9th Congressional district including parts of the city of Tacoma south of I-5 and east of Washington State Route 7, Puyallup, Lakewood, and Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The 10th district is currently represented by Marilyn Strickland, a (Democrat) and former Mayor of Tacoma. Prior to Strickland, the district was represented by Denny Heck, a (Democrat), who was the first to represent the 10th congressional district after its creation in 2013.












==Economy==
The largest public employer in Pierce County is Joint Base Lewis–McChord, which contributes about 60,000 military and civilian jobs. The largest private employers are MultiCare Health System and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, which operate the two largest hospitals in the county.

Pierce County agriculture has been an instrumental part of the local economy for almost 150 years. However, in the last half-century, much of the county&#x27;s farmland has been transformed into residential areas. Pierce County has taken aggressive steps to reverse this trend; the county recently created the Pierce County Farm Advisory Commission. This advisory board helps local farmers with the interpretation of land use regulations as well as the promotion of local produce. The creation of the Pierce County Farm Advisory Commission will attempt to save the remaining 48,000 acres of Pierce County farmland. Despite the loss of farmland, Pierce County continues to produce about 50% of the United States&#x27; rhubarb.

Additionally, the Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum, houses a large collection of original manuscripts and documents.

==Law enforcement==
The Pierce County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was founded in 1853, shortly after incorporation of the county.

Pierce County was noted for gangs, drugs, and criminal activity starting in the mid to late 1980s. Tacoma&#x27;s Hilltop neighborhood had gangs that were selling crack cocaine and gang violence. Increased police patrols and community watch programs led to reduced crime in the mid to late 2000s. As of 2006, 38% of the methamphetamine labs (138 sites) cleaned up by the Washington State Department of Ecology were in Pierce County. This reduction from a high of 589 labs in 2001 comes in part to a new law restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine and in part due to tougher prison sentences for methamphetamine producers.

<text>Pacific County is a county in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 23,365. Its county seat is South Bend, and its largest city is Raymond. The county was formed by the government of Oregon Territory in February 1851 and is named for the Pacific Ocean.

Pacific County is centered on Willapa Bay, a region that provides twenty-five percent of the United States oyster harvest, although forestry, fishing, and tourism are also significant elements of the county&#x27;s economy.

==History==
The area that is now Pacific County was part of Oregon Territory in the first part of the nineteenth century. On December 19, 1845, the Provisional Government of Oregon created two counties (Vancouver and Clark) in its northern portion (which is now the state of Washington). In 1849, the name of Vancouver County was changed to Lewis County, and on February 4, 1851, a portion of Lewis County was partitioned off to become Pacific County. The county&#x27;s boundaries have not changed since its creation. Pacific City was the first county seat, when it was annexed by the US military, the county seat was transferred to Chinookville. The unincorporated community of Oysterville, established in 1852, was the third county seat. The county records were stolen from Oysterville and ferried across Willapa Harbor by residents of South Bend, resulting in that town becoming the new county seat in 1893.

<text>Okanogan County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington along the Canada–U.S. border. As of the 2020 census, the population was 42,104. The county seat is Okanogan, while the most populous city is Omak. Its area is the largest in the state.

About a fifth of the county&#x27;s residents live in the Greater Omak Area. The county forms a portion of the Okanogan Country. The first county seat was Ruby, which has now been a ghost town for more than 100 years.

Okanogan County was formed out of Stevens County in February 1888. The name derives from the Okanagan language place name &quot;ukʷnaqín&quot;. The name Okanogan (Okanagan) also refers to a part of southern British Columbia.

==History==
Before Europeans arrived, the Okanogan County region was home to numerous indigenous peoples that would eventually become part of three Indian reservations referred to as the Northern Okanogans or Sinkaietk, Tokoratums, Kartars and Konkonelps. They spoke in seven types of Interior Salish languages related to the Puget Sound tribes. The Okanogans experienced a favorable climate, camping in the winter, hunting bears in the spring, catching fish in the summer and hunting deer in fall. The camps consisted of teepee-like longhouses built with hides and bark. Women gathered nuts and berries. A popular destination for this was the Kettle Falls, where the Columbia River dropped some .

Due to its remoteness, the Okanogan County area was one of the last in Washington settled by Europeans. It was an early thoroughfare used by prospectors to gain access to other communities, such as British Columbia. By the 21st century, the region specialized in agriculture, forestry and tourism. Electric producer Grand Coulee Dam was constructed between 1933 and 1942, originally with two power plants, around the Okanogan and Grant counties at the former&#x27;s southern border.

In July 2014, the Carlton Complex wildfire burned over in Okanogan County. It destroyed over 300 homes including 100 in and around Pateros

==Politics==
Okanogan County was once a national bellwether county in U.S. presidential elections, voting for the nationwide winner in each presidential election from 1904 to 1992. In fact, it became the longest-running national bellwether after Crook County, Oregon, voted for George H. W. Bush in 1992. However, it has become a Republican-leaning county since 1996, when it voted for Bob Dole, with the longest national bellwether status passing on to New Castle County, Delaware.

<text>Lincoln County is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,876, making it the fifth-least populous county in the state. The county seat and largest city is Davenport. Lincoln County was created from Whitman County in November 1883. It is named for Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.

==History==
In 1883, Lincoln County was created from a portion of Spokane County, and four days later a portion of its area was split to create Douglas County. There have been no further alterations to its boundary since that time. The name Sprague County was originally proposed, in honor of General John W. Sprague, until objections from legislators resulted in the name Lincoln County being used in the final bill. Its 2,317 square miles make it the eighth-largest by area in the state.

Centuries ago, the area now covered by Lincoln County contained an east–west passageway used by indigenous peoples. A spring near the present-day Davenport created a large overnight camping place.

The early exploration of the Northwest Territory by Lewis and Clark did not reach as far north as the Lincoln County expanses. The first recorded entry by European explorers was of David Thompson, a scout for the North West Company, who traversed the area in 1811. He noted physical locations in present-day Lincoln County. He described Hell Gate Rapid (calling it &#x27;Strong Rapid&#x27;). That stretch of the Columbia River is now tame, because of the presence of Grand Coulee Dam. After this, there was considerable exploration by fur trappers and others, including famed Scottish botanist David Douglas in 1826.

Possibly the first permanent non-indigenous resident of the area was R.M. Bacon, originally from Boston, who began raising cattle around Crab Creek in 1871. When the first post office was established in the county, Bacon was its postmaster.

Emigration into the area accelerated in the late 1870s. Completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883, and construction of Fort Spokane (1880-1882) hastened settlement.

==Geography and climate==
Lincoln County lies on the Channelled Scablands, known as the Big Bend Plateau. It lies 1,500-2,500 feet above sea level, with a system of channels eroded into bedrock by glacial rivers and streams, flowing from northeastern Washington.

Lincoln County climate is hot/dry in the summer, cold/moderately humid in the winter. Due to the relatively level terrain (about 1,200 feet difference from lowest to highest elevations), temperatures tend to vary little from east to west. Precipitation varies from an arid condition in the western part of the county to semi-arid in the northeast. The entire area lies in the dry intermontane basin between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountain System. Precipitation (10-20 inches annual rainfall) is a major controlling factor in agriculture. Precipitation in the Big Bend region is highly variable; from 8 inches in the west to 20 inches in the northeast.

Monthly temperature averages range from below freezing in mid-winter to highs of 65-71 °F in mid-summer.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water.

==Government and politics==
The county is administered by a three-member Board of Commissioners.

Like neighboring Adams County, Lincoln County is one of the most conservative counties in Washington. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was Harry Truman in 1948. In 1964, it was one of only three counties in the state to be carried by Barry Goldwater, and was the nation&#x27;s northernmost county or equivalent to vote for Goldwater. In the last nine presidential elections, no Democratic candidate has received more than 36 percent of the county&#x27;s vote; the last Democratic gubernatorial nominee it backed was Booth Gardner in 1988, during a major drought and farm crisis. In 2016, Donald Trump won over 70 percent of the county&#x27;s vote.












==Economy==
The county is dependent on agriculture, primarily wheat farming. Lincoln County is generally considered the second-largest producer of wheat in the United States (following Whitman County, Washington), sometimes producing 25 million bushels (680,000 t) per year. Only about 500,000 of 900,000 acres (2,000 of ) of farmland in the county are planted in any given year due to the practice of typically harvesting one crop every two years (&quot;summer-fallow&quot;), a necessity in a region with only of precipitation annually.

Livestock husbandry is also a significant county activity, although to a significantly lower degree. For example, in 1954 the county was #3 in the state for crop income, but was only #21 in the state for income from livestock and livestock products.

<doc id="91077" wikidata="Q111540" url="?curid=91077" title="Kittitas County, Washington">
<text>Kittitas County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Washington. At the 2020 census, its population was 44,337. Its county seat and largest city is Ellensburg. The county was created in November 1883 when it was carved out of Yakima County. Kittitas County comprises the Ellensburg, Washington, Micropolitan Statistical Area.

There are numerous interpretations of the county&#x27;s name, which is from the language of the Yakama Nation. According to one source, it &quot;has been said to mean everything from &#x27;white chalk&#x27; to &#x27;shale rock&#x27; to &#x27;shoal people&#x27; to &#x27;land of plenty&#x27;&quot;. Most anthropologists and historians concede that each interpretation has some validity depending upon the particular dialect spoken.

==History==
The county was organized in November 1883 by the Washington Territorial Legislature, carved from the northern part of Yakima County.

Indigenous peoples known as Kittitas (or Upper Yakima) occupied the lands along the Yakima River for hundreds of years before the present era. The Kittitas Valley was a traditional gathering place for tribes east of the Cascades.

White settlers began pouring into the Kittitas Valley in the late 1850s. Their arrival forced dislocation and displacement of the native inhabitants, who were eventually forced into the Yakama Indian Reservation. White settlers introduced livestock raising, crop farming, dairying, logging, lumber processing, and mining. The abundant grassland and the generally-favorable terrain made beef and cattle production become the county&#x27;s mainstay. That was assisted by the introduction of railways into the area and the large-scale irrigation systems introduced in the 1930s.

Wheat planting in Kittitas Valley began in 1868. The county&#x27;s first flour mill was established near Ellensburg in 1873. Production of alfalfa was also seen from the county&#x27;s early days.

Lumber extraction was an important county activity from its early days, mostly in the west end. Logging camps were established near the county&#x27;s three largest lakes (Cle Elum, Kachess, Keechelus).

Mining for coal and minerals was established by the mid-1880s.

The southeastern corner of the county is part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Yakima Training Center.
